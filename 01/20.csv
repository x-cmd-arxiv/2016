reformulated in terms of so-called magnetization variables $w$ that satisfy
\begin{equation}\label{Abs_magform} \partial_tw + (\mathbb{P} w \cdot\nabla)w +

equivalence of these formulations in the setting of weak solutions that are
also in $L^\infty(0,T;H^{1/2})\cap L^2(0,T;H^{3/2})$ on the 3-dimensional

  Our main focus is the proof of global well-posedness in $H^{1/2}$ for a new
variant of this system, where $\mathbb{P} w$ is replaced by $w$ in the second
nonlinear term: \begin{equation}\label{Abs_Simplified} \partial_tw +
(\mathbb{P} w \cdot\nabla)w + \frac{1}{2}\nabla|w|^2- \Delta w =0.

cosmic ray propagation in magnetohydrodynamic turbulent fields generated by
forcing the fluid velocity field at large scales. It provides a derivation of
the particle mean free path dependences in terms of the turbulence level
described by the Alfv\'enic Mach number and in terms of the particle rigidity.
We use an upgrade version of the magnetohydrodynamic code {\tt RAMSES} which
includes a forcing module and a kinetic module and solve the Lorentz equation
for each particle. The simulations are performed using a 3 dimension periodical
box in the test-particle and magnetostatic limits. The forcing module is
implemented using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. An ensemble average over a
large number of particle trajectories is applied to reconstruct the particle
mean free paths. We derive the cosmic ray mean free paths in terms of the
Alfv\'enic Mach numbers and particle reduced rigidities in different turbulence
forcing geometries. The reduced particle rigidity is $\rho=r_L/L$ where $r_L$
is the particle Larmor radius and $L$ is the simulation box length related to
the turbulence coherence or injection scale $L_{inj}$ by $L \sim 5 L_{inj}$. We
have investigated with a special attention compressible and solenoidal forcing
geometries. We find that compressible forcing solutions are compatible with the
quasi-linear theory or more advanced non-linear theories which predict a
rigidity dependence as $\rho^{1/2}$ or $\rho^{1/3}$. Solenoidal forcing
solutions at least at low or moderate Alfv\'enic numbers are not compatible
with the above theoretical expectations and require more refined arguments to
be interpreted. It appears especially for Alfv\'enic Mach numbers close to one
that the wandering of field lines controls perpendicular mean free path
solutions whatever the forcing geometry.

Balanced networks offer a parsimonious model of this variability. In balanced

inputs on average and spiking activity is driven by transient breaks in this
balance. Most previous studies of balanced networks assume a homogeneous or
distance-dependent connectivity structure, but connectivity in biological
cortical networks is more intricate. We use a heterogeneous mean-field theory

taken in a given finite set, by looking only at finite or periodic products. It
is known that when the matrices of the set have a common nonincreasing
polyhedral norm, all infinite products converge to zero if and only if all
infinite periodic products with period smaller than a certain value converge to
zero, and bounds exist on that value.
  We provide a stronger bound holding for both polyhedral norms and polyhedral
seminorms. In the latter case, the matrix products do not necessarily converge
to 0, but all trajectories of the associated system converge to a common
invariant space. We prove our bound to be tight, in the sense that for any
polyhedral seminorm, there is a set of matrices such that not all infinite
products converge, but every periodic product with period smaller than our
bound does converge.
  Our technique is based on an analysis of the combinatorial structure of the
face lattice of the unit ball of the nonincreasing seminorm. The bound we
obtain is equal to half the size of the largest antichain in this lattice.
Explicitly evaluating this quantity may be challenging in some cases. We
therefore link our problem with the Sperner property: the property that, for
some graded posets, -- in this case the face lattice of the unit ball -- the
size of the largest antichain is equal to the size of the largest rank level.
  We show that some sets of matrices with invariant polyhedral seminorms lead
to posets that do not have that Sperner property. However, this property holds
for the polyhedron obtained when treating sets of stochastic matrices, and our
bound can then be easily evaluated in that case. In particular, we show that
for the dimension of the space $n \geq 8$, our bound is smaller than the
previously known bound by a multiplicative factor of $\frac{3}{2 \sqrt{\pi

hydrodynamic calculations, we find that a planetary-mass companion located at
the outer disk could be responsible for these observed structures. In this
model, the planet excites primary and secondary arms interior to its orbit. It
also carves a gap and generates a local pressure bump at the inner gap edge
where a vortex forms through Rossby wave instability. The vortex traps radially
drifting dust particles, forming a dust-depleted cavity in the inner disk. We
propose that the vortex is responsible for the brightest southwestern peak seen
in infrared scattered light and sub-millimeter dust continuum emission. In
particular, it is possible that the scattered light is boosted as one of the
spiral arms passes through the high density vortex region, although the vortex
alone may be able to explain the peak. We suggest that a planetary companion
with a mass of 10-15 M_J is orbiting SAO 206462 at 100-120 au. Monitoring of
the brightest peak over the next few years will help reveal its origin because
the spiral arms and vortex will show distinguishable displacement.

field image of NGC 4569, the brightest late-type galaxy in the Virgo cluster.
The image reveals the presence of long tails of diffuse ionised gas without any
associated stellar component extending from the disc of the galaxy up to ~ 80
kpc (projected distance) with a typical surface brightness of a few 10^-18 erg
s-1 cm-2 arcsec-2. These features provide direct evidence that NGC 4569 is
undergoing a ram presure stripping event. The image also shows a prominent 8
kpc spur of ionised gas associated to the nucleus that spectroscopic data
identify as an outflow. With some assumptions on the 3D distribution of the
gas, we use the Halpha surface brightness of these extended low surface
brightness features to derive the density and the mass of the gas stripped
during the interaction of the galaxy with the ICM. The comparison with ad-hoc
chemo-spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution indicates that the mass of
the Halpha emitting gas in the tail is comparable to that of the cold phase
stripped from the disc, suggesting that the gas is ionised within the tail
during the stripping process. The lack of star forming regions suggests that
mechanisms other than photoionisation are responsible for the excitation of the
gas (shocks, heat conduction, magneto hydrodynamic waves). This analysis
indicates that ram pressure stripping is efficient in massive (M_star ~ 10^10.5
Mo) galaxies located in intermediate mass (~ 10^14 Mo) clusters under
formation. It also shows that the mass of gas expelled by the nuclear outflow
is ~ 1 % than that removed during the ram pressure stripping event. All
together these results indicate that ram pressure stripping, rather than
starvation through nuclear feedback, can be the dominant mechanism responsible
for the quenching of the star formation activity of galaxies in high density
environments.

  In this paper we provide combinatorial models for three families of

the entries of the $g$-vector combinatorially, but as an alternating sum. In
the case of the $q$-analogue of $n!$, we use a sign-reversing involution to
interpret the alternating sum, resulting in a manifestly positive formula for
the $g$-vector. In other words, we give a combinatorial proof of unimodality.

has yet been recognized. In this paper, we derive the FRW metric coefficients
from the general form of the spherically symmetric line element and demonstrate
that, because the co-moving frame also happens to be in free fall, the
symmetries in FRW are valid only for a medium with zero active mass. In other
words, the spacetime of a perfect fluid in cosmology may be correctly written
as FRW only when its equation of state is rho+3p=0, in terms of the total
pressure p and total energy density rho. There is now compelling observational
support for this conclusion, including the Alcock--Paczynski test, which shows
that only an FRW cosmology with zero active mass is consistent with the latest
model-independent baryon acoustic oscillation data.

and projective planes based on fields. In this thesis we approach affine and
projective planes from a constructive point of view and we base our geometry on
local rings instead of fields. We start by constructing projective and affine
planes over local rings and establishing forms of Desargues' Theorem and
Pappus' Theorem which hold for these. From this analysis we derive coherent
theories of projective and affine planes. The great Greek mathematicians of the
classical period used geometry as the basis for their theory of quantities. The
modern version of this idea is the reconstruction of algebra from geometry. We
show how we can construct a local ring whenever we are given an affine or a
projective plane. This enables us to describe the classifying toposes of our
theories of affine and projective planes as extensions of the Zariski topos by
certain group actions. Through these descriptions of the classifying toposes,
the links between the theories of local rings, affine and projective planes
become clear. In particular, the geometric morphisms between these classifying
toposes are all induced by group homomorphisms even though they demonstrate
complicated constructions in geometry. In this thesis, we also prove results in
topos theory which are applied to these geometric morphisms to give Morita
equivalences between some further theories.

axisymmetric shape confined between two large hard co-planar substrates, with
the axis of the film perpendicular to the substrates. We address the impact
that thermal fluctuations of the cross-links have on the free energy of elastic
deformation of the system, subject to the requirement that the fluctuating
elastomer cannot detach from the substrates. We examine the behavior of the
deformation free energy for one case where a rigid pinning boundary condition
is applied to a class of elastic fluctuations at the confining surfaces, and
another case where the same elastic fluctuations are subjected to soft ""gluing""
potentials. We find that there can be significant departures (both quantitative
and qualitative) from the prediction of classical rubber elasticity theory when
elastic fluctuations are included. Finally, we compare the character of the
attractive part of the elastic fluctuation-induced, or pseudo-Casimir, stress
with the standard thermal Casimir stress in confined but non-elastomeric
systems, finding the same power law decay behavior when a rigid pinning
boundary condition is applied, for the case of the gluing potential, we find
that the leading order correction to the attractive part of the fluctuation
stress decays inversely with the inter-substrate separation.

$0\leq d<5/3$ by Booker in his pioneering paper, and in these notes we consider
an extension of his methods to $0\leq d<2$. This is simultaneously a
generalisation of Booker's result and the results and techniques of
Kaczorowski--Perelli in the Selberg class (the best known to date).
Furthermore, we consider applications to zeros of automorphic $L$-functions. In
these notes we review Booker's results and announce new ones to appear
elsewhere shortly.

extensive attention in material design for spintronics. Existing progress in
such a search often requires peculiar atomistic lattice configuration and also
lacks active control of the resulting electronic properties. Here we reveal
that a boron-nitride nanoribbon with a carbon-doped edge can be made a
half-metal or a spin-gapless semiconductor in a programmable fashion. The
mechanical strain serves as the on/off switches for functions of half-metal and
spin-gapless semiconductor to occur. Our findings shed light on how the edge
doping combined with strain engineering can affect electronic properties of

empirical and theoretical results demonstrating both greater efficacy and
greater stability compared to competing approaches. Classic examples have
exploited closed-form projections and smoothness of the objective function. We
extend the approach to problems that include non-smooth terms, and where the
projection subproblems can only be solved inexactly by iterative methods. We
propose an inexact adaptive algonrithm for solving such problems and analyze

output to one aggregate variable (GDP), product diversity is central to
economic development, as recent 'economic complexity' research suggests. A
country's product diversity reflects its diversity of knowhow or
'capabilities'. Researchers proposed the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and
the country Fitness index to estimate a country's number of capabilities from
international export data; these measures predict economic growth better than
conventional variables such as human capital. This paper offers a simpler
measure of a country's knowhow, Log Product Diversity (or LPD, the logarithm of
a country's number of products), which can be derived from a one-parameter
combinatorial model of production in which a set of knowhows combine with some
probability to turn raw materials into a product. ECI and log-fitness can be
interpreted theoretically (using the combinatorial model) and empirically as
potentially noisy estimates of LPD; moreover, controlling for natural
resources, the simple measure better explains the cross-country differences in
GDP and in GDP per capita.

in indexed string matching. It can be used to speed up searching using the
suffix array (SA) and provides an implicit representation of the topology of an
underlying suffix tree. The LCP array of a string of length $n$ can be
represented as an array of length $n$ words, or, in the presence of the SA, as
a bit vector of $2n$ bits plus asymptotically negligible support data
structures. External memory construction algorithms for the LCP array have been
proposed, but those proposed so far have a space requirement of $O(n)$ words
(i.e. $O(n \log n)$ bits) in external memory. This space requirement is in some
practical cases prohibitively expensive. We present an external memory
algorithm for constructing the $2n$ bit version of the LCP array which uses
$O(n \log \sigma)$ bits of additional space in external memory when given a
(compressed) BWT with alphabet size $\sigma$ and a sampled inverse suffix array
at sampling rate $O(\log n)$. This is often a significant space gain in
practice where $\sigma$ is usually much smaller than $n$ or even constant. We
also consider the case of computing succinct LCP arrays for circular strings.

Lagrangian is used to define multi-momenta, and to develop de-Donder Weyl
Hamiltonian equations. The de Donder Weyl equations are cast in a
multi-symplectic form. The pullback conservation laws and the symplecticity
conservation laws are obtained. One class of symplecticity conservation laws
give rise to vorticity and potential vorticity type conservation laws, and
another class of symplecticity laws are related to derivatives of the
Lagrangian energy conservation law with respect to the Lagrangian mass
coordinates $m^i$. We show that the vorticity-symplecticity laws can be derived
by a Lie dragging method, and also by using Noether's second theorem and a
fluid relabelling symmetry which is a divergence symmetry of the action. We
obtain the Cartan-Poincar\'e form describing the equations and we discuss a set
of differential forms representing the equation system.

risk based inference for dynamical systems and ergodic processes. The analysis
applies to a two-stage estimation procedure in which (i) the trajectory of an
observed (but unknown) system is fit to a trajectory from a known reference
system by minimizing cumulative per-state loss, and (ii) a parameter estimate
is obtained from the initial state of the best fit reference trajectory. We
show that the empirical risk of the best fit trajectory converges almost surely
to a constant that can be expressed in a variational form as the minimal
expected loss over dynamically invariant couplings (joinings) of the observed
and reference systems. Moreover, we establish that the family of joinings
minimizing the expected loss is convex and compact, and that it fully
characterizes the asymptotic behavior of the estimated parameters, addressing
both identifiability and misspecification. The two-stage estimation framework
and associated variational analysis apply to a broad family of empirical risk
miminization procedures for dependent observations. To illustrate this, we
apply variational analysis to the well studied problems of maximum likelihood
and non-linear regression, and then undertake an extended analysis of system
identification from quantized trajectories subject to noise, a problem of
interest in dynamics, where the models themselves exhibit dynamical behavior
across time.

particular interest are single soliton states, whose $\mathrm{sech}^{2}$
spectral envelope provides a spectrally smooth and low noise optical frequency
comb, and that recently have been generated in crystalline, silica, and
silicon-nitride resonators. Here, we study the dynamics of multiple soliton
states containing ${N}$ solitons and report the discovery of a novel, yet
simple mechanism which makes it possible to reduce deterministically the number
of solitons, one by one, i.e. ${N\! \to\! N\!-\!1\! \to\! \dots \!\to\! 1}$. By
applying weak phase modulation, we directly characterize the soliton state via
a double-resonance response. The dynamical probing demonstrates that
transitions occur in a predictable way, and thereby enables us to map
experimentally the underlying multi-stability diagram of dissipative Kerr
solitons. These measurements reveal the ""lifted"" degeneracy of soliton states
as a result of the power-dependent thermal shift of the cavity resonance (i.e.
the thermal nonlinearity). The experimental results are in agreement with
theoretical and numerical analysis that incorporate the thermal nonlinearity.
By studying two different microresonator platforms (integrated
$\mathrm{Si_{3}N_{4}}$ microresonators and crystalline $\mathrm{MgF_{2}}$
resonators) we confirm that these effects have a universal nature. Beyond
elucidating the fundamental dynamical properties of dissipative Kerr solitons
the observed phenomena are also of practical relevance, providing a
manipulation toolbox which enables to sequentially reduce, monitor and
stabilize the number ${N}$ of solitons, preventing it from decay. Achieving
reliable single soliton operation and stabilization in this manner in optical
resonators is imperative to applications.

generated by the loop effect of new particles with their couplings and masses
to be of order 0.1-1 and TeV, respectively. The lightest right-handed neutrino,
which runs in the three-loop diagram, can be a dark matter candidate. In
addition, the deviation in the measured value of the muon anomalous magnetic
moment from its prediction in the standard model can be compensated by one-loop
diagrams with exotic multi-charged leptons and scalar bosons. For the diphoton
event, an additional isospin singlet real scalar field plays the role to
explain the excess by taking its mass of 750 GeV, where it is produced from the
gluon fusion production via the mixing with the standard model like Higgs
boson. We find that the cross section of the diphoton process can be obtained
to be a few fb level by taking the masses of new charged particles to be about
375 GeV and related coupling constants to be order 1.

when the composition theorem is not helpful, we can often prove privacy by a
coupling argument.
  We demonstrate our methods on two algorithms: the Exponential mechanism and
the Above Threshold algorithm, the critical component of the famous Sparse
Vector algorithm. We verify these examples in a relational program logic
apRHL+, which can construct approximate couplings. This logic extends the
existing apRHL logic with more general rules for the Laplace mechanism and the
one-sided Laplace mechanism, and new structural rules enabling pointwise
reasoning about privacy; all the rules are inspired by the connection with
coupling. While our paper is presented from a formal verification perspective,

quantization $\mathbb{A}_\hbar(M)$ of a symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$. This
canonically induces an action of $\Gamma$ by symplectomorphisms on $M$. We
examine the reverse problem of extending group actions by symplectomorphisms to
the deformation quantization. To do this we first define a notion of extension
that does not impose restrictions on the Fedosov connection realizing
$\mathbb{A}_\hbar(M)$ in its gauge equivalence class by considering composition
of pull-back with certain inner automorphisms of sections of the Weyl bundle.
We reformulate the well known sufficient conditions for existence of such
extensions and show by way of example that they are not necessary. We then turn
to the corresponding classification problem of extensions of a given action by
symplectomorphisms. To this end we associate a group $\bar{\mathcal{G}_\nabla}$
to each Fedosov connection $\nabla$ and show that the (non-Abelian) group
cohomology $\mbox{H}^1(\Gamma,\bar{\mathcal{G}_\nabla})$ classifies extensions
up to a natural notion of equivalence. Finally we develop several tools that
allow for computation of $\mbox{H}^1(\Gamma,\bar{\mathcal{G}_\nabla})$ and

transitions in various materials. One efficient way to investigate competing
orders is to first classify different class of excitations in a given quantum
phase, then study their competing responses under various external probes. This
strategy may not only lead to deep understanding of the quantum phase itself,
but also its deep connections to various other quantum phases nearby. We
implement this approach by studying the Rotated Ferromagnetic Heisenberg model
(RFHM) in two different transverse fields $h_x$ and $h_z$ which can be
intuitively visualized as studying spin-orbit couplings (SOC) effects in 2d
Ising or anisotropic XY model in a transverse field. At a special SOC class, it
was known that the RFHM at a zero field owns an exact ground state called Y-x
state. It supports non only the commensurate C-C$_0$ and C-C$_{\pi} $ magnons,
but also the in-commensurate C-IC magnons. These magnons are non-relativistic,
not contained in the exact ground state, so need to be thermally excited. Their
dramatic response under the longitudinal $ h_y $ field was recently worked out
by the authors. Here we find they respond very differently under the two
transverse fields. Any $h_x$ ($h_z$) changes the collinear Y-x state to a
canted co-planar YX-x (YZ-x) state which suffers quantum fluctuations. The
C-C$_0$, C-C$_{\pi} $ and C-IC magnons sneak into the quantum ground state,
become relativistic and play leading roles even at $ T=0 $. We map out the
boundaries among the C-C$_0$, C-C$_{\pi} $ and C-IC magnons, especially the
detailed evolution of the C-IC magnons inside the canted phases. As $h_x$
($h_z$) increases further, the C-C$_0$ magnons always win the competition and
emerge as the seeds to drive a transition from the YX-x (YZ-x) to the X-FM (
Z-FM ) which is shown to be in the 3d Ising universality class.

has led to the rapidly increasing demand in wireless spectrum. Hence, we have
been facing a critical spectrum shortage problem even though several
measurements have indicated that most licensed radio spectrum is very
underutilized. These facts have motivated the development of dynamic spectrum
access (DSA) and cognitive radio techniques to enhance the efficiency and
flexibility of spectrum utilization.
  In this dissertation, we investigate design, analysis, and optimization
issues for joint spectrum sensing and cognitive medium access control (CMAC)
protocol engineering for cognitive radio networks (CRNs). The joint spectrum
sensing and CMAC design is considered under the interweave spectrum sharing
paradigm and different communications settings. Our research has resulted in
four major research contributions, namely, the CMAC protocol design with
parallel spectrum sensing, the CMAC protocol with sequential sensing, the CMAC
protocol with cooperative sensing and the asynchronous Full-Duplex cognitive
MAC.
  We develop various analytical models for throughput performance analysis of
our proposed CMAC protocol designs. Based on these analytical models, we
develop different efficient algorithms to configure the CMAC protocol including
channel allocation, sensing time, transmit power, contention window to maximize
the total throughput of the secondary network. Furthermore, extensive numerical
results are presented to gain further insights and to evaluate the performance
of our CMAC protocol designs. Both the numerical and simulation results confirm
that our proposed CMAC protocols can achieve efficient spectrum utilization and
significant performance gains compared to existing and unoptimized designs.

  Modeling with Covariates","31 pages, 6 figures",,,,"stat.ME q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Effective population size characterizes the genetic variability in a
population and is a parameter of paramount importance in population genetics.
Kingman's coalescent process enables inference of past population dynamics
directly from molecular sequence data, and researchers have developed a number
of flexible coalescent-based models for Bayesian nonparametric estimation of
the effective population size as a function of time. A major goal of
demographic reconstruction is understanding the association between the
effective population size and potential explanatory factors. Building upon
Bayesian nonparametric coalescent-based approaches, we introduce a flexible
framework that incorporates time-varying covariates through Gaussian Markov
random fields. To approximate the posterior distribution, we adapt efficient
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms designed for highly structured Gaussian
models. Incorporating covariates into the demographic inference framework
enables the modeling of associations between the effective population size and
covariates while accounting for uncertainty in population histories.
Furthermore, it can lead to more precise estimates of population dynamics. We
apply our model to four examples. We reconstruct the demographic history of
raccoon rabies in North America and find a significant association with the
spatiotemporal spread of the outbreak. Next, we examine the effective
population size trajectory of the DENV-4 virus in Puerto Rico along with viral
isolate count data and find similar cyclic patterns. We compare the population
history of the HIV-1 CRF02_AG clade in Cameroon with HIV incidence and
prevalence data and find that the effective population size is more reflective
of incidence rate. Finally, we explore the hypothesis that the population
dynamics of musk ox during the Late Quaternary period were related to climate
change.

SU(2)$_R$ gauge bosons decaying through right-handed neutrinos into the two
electron plus two jets ($eejj$) final states. This can be explained if the
SU(2)$_R$ charged gauge bosons $W_R^\pm$ have a mass of around 2 TeV and a
right-handed neutrino with a mass of ${\cal O}(1)$ TeV mainly decays to
electron. Indeed, recent results in several other experiments, especially that
from the ATLAS diboson resonance search, also indicate signatures of such a 2
TeV gauge boson. However, a lack of the same-sign electron events in the CMS
$eejj$ search challenges the interpretation of the right-handed neutrino as a
Majorana fermion. Taking this situation into account, in this paper, we
consider a possibility of explaining the CMS $eejj$ excess based on the
$SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_R\otimes U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge theory with pseudo-Dirac
neutrinos. We find that both the CMS excess events and the ATLAS diboson
anomaly can actually be explained in this framework without conflicting with
the current experimental bounds. This setup in general allows sizable
left-right mixing in both the charged gauge boson and neutrino sectors, which
enables us to probe this model through the trilepton plus missing-energy search
at the LHC. It turns out that the number of events in this channel predicted in
our model is in good agreement with that observed by the CMS collaboration. We
also discuss prospects for testing this model at the LHC Run-II experiments.

only in some stars must be responsible with the merging of pre-MS and MS stars
being suggested as one such channel. Stars emerging from the coalescence of two
MS stars are rejuvenated, appearing younger than they are. They can therefore
be identified by comparison with reference clocks. Here we predict the
rejuvenation of MS merger products over a wide range of masses and binary
configurations calibrated to smoothed-particle-hydrodynamical merger models. We
find that the rejuvenation is of the order of the nuclear timescale and is
strongest in the lowest-mass mergers and the most evolved binary progenitors
with the largest mass ratios. These predictions allow us to put constraints on
the binary progenitors of merger products. We show that the magnetic stars HR
2949 and $\tau$ Sco are younger than the potential binary companion HR 2948 and
the Upper-Sco association, respectively, making them promising merger
candidates. We find that the age discrepancies and the potential binary
progenitors of both are consistent with them being rejuvenated merger products,
implying that their magnetic fields may originate from this channel. Searching
for age discrepancies in magnetic stars is therefore a powerful way to explore
which fraction of magnetic stars may have obtained their strong magnetic field
in MS mergers and to improve our understanding of magnetism in massive stars

predicted from the stellar population, suggestive of cool gas being driven out

transformation than traditionally selected poststarburst galaxies, and that a
large proportion of SPOGs* also have properties consistent with disruption of
their interstellar media, a key component to galaxy transformation. It is
likely that many of the known pathways to transformation undergo a SPOG phase.
Studying this sample of SPOGs* further, including their morphologies, active

methods. In processes with several jets, one typically encounters hierarchies
in the jet transverse momenta and/or dijet invariant masses. Large logarithms
of the ratios of these kinematic jet scales in the cross section are at present
primarily described by parton showers. We present a general factorization
framework called SCET$_+$, which is an extension of Soft-Collinear Effective
Theory (SCET) and allows for a systematic higher-order resummation of such
kinematic logarithms for generic jet hierarchies. In SCET$_+$ additional
intermediate soft/collinear modes are used to resolve jets arising from
additional soft and/or collinear QCD emissions. The resulting factorized cross
sections utilize collinear splitting amplitudes and soft gluon currents and
fully capture spin and color correlations. We discuss how to systematically
combine the different kinematic regimes to obtain a complete description of the

mixing between the dark and Standard Model sector. Within this framework it is
shown that the DM annihilation into bottom-quark pair, Higgs pair, and new
scalar pair can give good fits to the Fermi gamma-ray data. Moreover
unavoidable constraints from the antiproton ratio by the PAMELA and AMS-02, the
gamma-ray emission from the dwarf spheroidal galaxies by the Fermi-LAT, and the

forming galaxies with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space

lines to characterize the different ionization states of outflowing gas. We
measure the equivalent widths, line widths, and outflow velocities of the four
transitions, and find shallow scaling relations between them and galactic
stellar mass and star formation rate. Regardless of the ionization potential,
lines of similar strength have similar velocities and line widths, indicating
that the four transitions can be modeled as a co-moving phase. The Si
equivalent width ratios (e.g. Si IV/Si II) have low dispersion, and little
variation with stellar mass; while ratios with O I and Si vary by a factor of 2
for a given stellar mass. Photo-ionization models reproduce these equivalent
width ratios, while shock models under predict the relative amount of high
ionization gas. The photo-ionization models constrain the ionization parameter
(U) between -2.25 < log(U) < -1.5, and require that the outflow metallicities
are greater than 0.5 Z$_\odot$. We derive ionization fractions for the
transitions, and show that the range of ionization parameters and stellar
metallicities leads to a factor of 1.15-10 variation in the ionization
fractions. Historically, mass outflow rates are calculated by converting a
column density measurement from a single metal ion into a total Hydrogen column
density using an ionization fraction, thus mass outflow rates are sensitive to
the assumed ionization structure of the outflow.

at the 2.1 m San Pedro Martir Observatory telescope (Mexico). We performed
optical and NIR photometric observations with both the REM telescope and the
New Technology Telescope (NTT) in La Silla. We obtained optical and UV
observations from the Swift archive. Finally, we performed optical polarimetry
of the source by using the EFOSC2 instrument mounted on the NTT. The optical
spectrum of the source is almost featureless since the hydrogen and He I
emissions lines, typically observed in LMXBs, are not detected. Similarly,
carbon and oxygen lines are neither observed. We marginally detect the He II
4686 AA emission line, suggesting the presence of helium in the accretion disc.
No significant optical polarisation level was observed. The lack of hydrogen
and He I emission lines in the spectrum implies that the companion is likely
not a main sequence star. Driven by the tentative detection of the He II 4686
AA emission line, we suggest that the system could harbour a helium white
dwarf. If this is the case, 1RXS J180408.9-342058 would be an ultra-compact
X-ray binary. By combining an estimate of the mass accretion rate together with
evolutionary tracks for a He white dwarf, we obtain a tentative orbital period
of ~ 40 min. On the other hand, we also built the NIR-optical-UV spectral
energy distribution (SED) of the source at two different epochs. One SED was
gathered when the source was in the soft X-ray state, and it is consistent with
the presence of a single thermal component. The second SED, obtained when the
source was in the hard X-ray state, shows a thermal component together with a
tail in the NIR, likely indicating the presence of a (transient) jet.

Matter posit the existence of an ensemble of individual dark components with
differing masses, cosmological abundances, and couplings to the Standard Model.
Perhaps the most critical among these features is the spectrum of masses, as
this goes a long way towards determining the cosmological abundances and
lifetimes of the corresponding states. Many different underlying theoretical
structures can be imagined for the dark sector, each giving rise to its own
mass spectrum and corresponding density of states. In this paper, by contrast,
we investigate the spectrum of masses that emerges statistically from
underlying processes which are essentially random. We find a density of states
$n(m)$ which decreases as a function of mass and actually has an upper limit
$m_{\rm max}$ beyond which $n(m)=0$. We also demonstrate that this ""emergent""
density of states is particularly auspicious from the perspective of the
Dynamical Dark Matter framework, leading to cosmological abundances and decay
widths that are suitably balanced against each other across the dark-matter
ensemble. Thus randomness in the dark sector coexists quite naturally with
Dynamical Dark Matter, and we examine the prospects for observing the signals
of such scenarios in dark-matter indirect-detection experiments.

of the warm Jupiters are closely flanked by small companions. Statistically,
the companion fractions for hot and warm Jupiters are mutually exclusive,
particularly in regard to inner companions.
  The high companion fraction of warm Jupiters also yields clues to their
formation. The warm Jupiters that have close-by siblings should have low
orbital eccentricities and low mutual inclinations. The orbital configurations
of these systems are reminiscent of those of the low-mass, close-in planetary
systems abundantly discovered by the Kepler mission. This, and other arguments,
lead us to propose that these warm Jupiters are formed in-situ. There are
indications that there may be a second population of warm Jupiters with
different characteristics. In this picture, WASP-47b could be regarded as the
extending tail of the in-situ warm Jupiters into the hot Jupiter region, and

radio luminosities are related by $L_\gamma \propto L_r^{0.89+-0.04}$. The
brightness temperatures of the radio cores increase with the average gamma-ray
luminosity, and the presence of brightness temperatures above the inverse

types using a focalized subtyping judgment. We use refinement types to avoid
explicitly passing equality proofs in our term syntax, making our calculus
similar to languages such as Haskell and OCaml. We also extend the declarative
specification with an explicit rules for deducing when a type is principal,
permitting us to give a complete declarative specification for a rich type
system with significant type inference. We also give a set of algorithmic
typing rules, and prove that it is sound and complete with respect to the
declarative system. The proof requires a number of technical innovations,
including proving soundness and completeness in a mutually recursive fashion.

qualitatively similar to those obtained via p-value analysis, and support the
presence of a correlation in the data. The results are more robust in their
derivation and more informative, revealing interesting features such as
asymmetric posterior distributions or markedly different credible intervals,
and allowing for a deeper exploration.
  We encourage the reader interested in this kind of problem to apply our code
to his/her own scientific problems. The full understanding of what the Bayesian
framework is can only be gained through the insight that comes by handling

horizons (foliated by marginally trapped surfaces) make their first appearance
either within the collapsing matter or where it joins on to a vacuum exterior.
Those which then move outwards with respect to the matter have been proposed
for use in defining black holes, replacing the global concept of an ""event
horizon"" which has some serious drawbacks for practical applications. We here
present results from a study of the properties of both outgoing and ingoing
trapping horizons, assuming strict spherical symmetry throughout. We have
investigated their causal nature (i.e. whether they are spacelike, timelike or
null), making contact with the Misner-Sharp- Hernandez formalism, which has
often been used for numerical calculations of spherical collapse. We follow two
different approaches, one using a geometrical quantity related to expansions of
null geodesic congruences, and the other using the horizon velocity measured
with respect to the collapsing matter. After an introduction to these concepts,
we then implement them within numerical simulations of stellar collapse,
revisiting pioneering calculations from the 1960s where some features of the
emergence and subsequent behaviour of trapping horizons could already be seen.
Our presentation here is aimed firmly at ""real world"" applications of interest
to astrophysicists and includes the effects of pressure, which may be important
for the asymptotic behaviour of the ingoing horizon.

rats which individual tissue geometries have been approximated by those

localizations. With the half and fifth sensitivity volumes we determine both
the theoretical minimum electrode separation for non-redundant scalp EEG
measurements and the electrode sensitivity resolution, which vary over the
scalp because of the head geometry. According to our results, electrodes should
be at least ~3-3.5 mm apart for an optimal configuration. The sensitivity
resolution is generally worse for electrodes at the boundaries of the scalp
measured region, though, by analogy with human montages, concentrates the
sensitivity enough to localize sources. Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds of source
localization errors indicate it is theoretically possible to achieve ESI
accuracy at the level of anatomical structures, such as the stimulus-specific
somatosensory areas, using the template. More validation for this approximation
is provided through the comparison between the template and the individual lead
field matrices, for several rats. Finally, using well-accepted inverse methods,
we demonstrate that somatosensory ESI is not only expected but also allows
exploring unknown phenomena related to global sensory integration. Inheriting
the advantages and pitfalls of human ESI, rat ESI will boost the understanding

disease outcomes in patients. Here we present a network-based approach that
integrates copy-number and expression profiles to identify putative cis- and
trans-associated genes in breast cancer pathogenesis. We validate these cis-
and trans-associated genes by employing them to subtype a large cohort of
breast tumours obtained from the METABRIC consortium, and demonstrate that
these genes accurately reconstruct the ten subtypes of breast cancer. We
observe that individual breast cancer subtypes are driven by distinct sets of

several known drivers of breast cancer (e.g. CCND1, ERRB2, MDM2 and ZNF703) and
some novel putative drivers (e.g. BRF2 and SF3B3). siRNA-mediated knockdown of
BRF2 across a panel of breast cancer cell lines showed significant reduction
specifically in cell proliferation in HER2+ lines, thereby indicating that BRF2
could be a context-dependent oncogene and potentially targetable in these

attention recently, partially in virtue of its connection to several other
topics as quadrature domains, inverse potential problems and the Laplacian
growth.
  In this paper we consider the normal matrix model with cubic plus linear
potential. To regularize the model, we follow Elbau & Felder and introduce a
cut-off. In the large size limit, the eigenvalues of the model accumulate
uniformly within a certain domain $\Omega$ that we determine explicitly by
finding the rational parametrization of its boundary.
  We also study in details the mother body problem associated to $\Omega$. It
turns out that the mother body measure $\mu_*$ displays a novel phase
transition that we call the mother body phase transition: although $\partial
\Omega$ evolves analytically, the mother body measure undergoes a ""one-cut to
three-cut"" phase transition.
  To construct the mother body measure, we define a quadratic differential
$\varpi$ on the associated spectral curve, and embed $\mu_*$ into its critical
graph. Using deformation techniques for quadratic differentials, we are able to
get precise information on $\mu_*$. In particular, this allows us to determine
the phase diagram for the mother body phase transition explicitly.
  Following previous works of Bleher & Kuijlaars and Kuijlaars & L\'opez, we
consider multiple orthogonal polynomials associated with the model. Applying
the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method to the associated
Riemann-Hilbert problem, we obtain asymptotic formulas for these polynomials.
Due to the presence of the linear term in the potential, there are no
rotational symmetries in the model. This makes the construction of the
associated $g$-functions significantly more involved, and the critical graph of
$\varpi$ becomes the key technical tool in this analysis as well.

sufficient envelope mass can be photoevaporated away for these planets to
become habitable. We improve upon previous work by using hydrodynamic models
that account for radiative cooling as well as the transition from hydrodynamic
to ballistic escape. Adopting a template active M dwarf XUV spectrum, including
stellar evolution, and considering both evaporation and thermal evolution, we
show that: (1) the mass-loss is (considerably) lower than previous estimates
that use an ""energy-limited"" formalism and ignore the transition to Jeans
escape, (2) at the inner edge of the HZ, planets with core mass $\lesssim 0.9$

mass-fraction is $\sim$1%, (3) at the outer edge of the HZ, evaporation cannot
remove a $\sim$1% H/He envelope even from cores down to 0.8 M$_\oplus$. Thus,
if planets form with bulky H/He envelopes, only those with low-mass cores may
eventually be habitable. Cores $\gtrsim$ 1 M$_\oplus$, with $\gtrsim$1% natal

in various systems. However, it is not easy to observe in superconducting
quantum circuits (SQCs), because the Rabi frequency of the strong controlling
field corresponding to EIT is limited by the decay rates of the SQCs. Here, we
show that EIT can be achieved by engineering decay rates in a superconducting
circuit QED system through a classical driving field on the qubit. Without such
a driving field, the superconducting qubit and the cavity field are
approximately decoupled in the large detuning regime, and thus the eigenstates
of the system are approximately product states of the cavity field and qubit
states. However, the driving field can strongly mix these product states and
so-called polariton states can be formed. The weights of the states for the
qubit and cavity field in the polariton states can be tuned by the driving
field, and thus the decay rates of the polariton states can be changed. We
choose a three-level system with $\Lambda$-type transitions in such a driven
circuit QED system, and demonstrate how EIT and ATS can be realized in this
compound system. We believe that this study will be helpful for EIT experiments
using SQCs.

(0.57^{+1.29}_{-0.40})x10^9 M_sun, (1.58^{+4.04}_{-1.13})x10^9 M_sun, and

We performed $N$-body simulations of planetesimal disks with large width (0.7 -
4AU) which ranges over the ice line. The simulations consisted of two stages.
The first stage simulations were carried out to see the runaway growth phase
using the planetesimals of initially the same mass. The runaway growth took
place both at the inner edge of the disk and at the region just outside the ice
line. This result was utilized for the initial setup of the second stage
simulations in which the runaway bodies just outside the ice line were replaced
by the protoplanets with about the isolation mass. In the second stage
simulations, the outward migration of the protoplanet was followed by the
stopping of the migration due to the increase of the random velocity of the
planetesimals. Due to this increase of random velocities, one of the PDM
criteria derived in Minton and Levison (2014) was broken. In the current
simulations, the effect of the gas disk is not considered. It is likely that
the gas disk plays an important role in planetesimal driven migration, and we

measures is constructed, which is marginally equivalent to the normalized
generalized Gamma process, a well-known prior for nonparametric analyses. In
our prior the dependence and similarity between microbial distributions is
represented by latent factors that concentrate in a low dimensional space. We
use a shrinkage prior to tune the dimensionality of the latent factors. The
resulting posterior samples of model parameters can be used to evaluate
uncertainty in analyses routinely applied in microbiome studies. Specifically,
by combining them with multivariate data analysis techniques we can visualize
credible regions in ecological ordination plots. The characteristics of the

lattices hosting conical intersections in their energy-momentum spectrum. The
best known example is the Dirac cone, where propagation is governed by an
effective Dirac equation, with electron spin replaced by a ""fermionic""
half-integer pseudospin. However, in many systems such as metamaterials, modal
symmetries result in the formation of higher order conical intersections with
integer or ""bosonic"" pseudospin. The ability to engineer lattices with these
qualitatively different singular dispersion relations opens up many
applications, including superior slab lasers, generation of orbital angular
momentum, zero-index metamaterials, and quantum simulation of exotic phases of
relativistic matter.

originally suggested by Wigner and has been generally regarded as valid, is
seriously questioned by recent high-precision nuclear mass measurements. The
usual resolution to this problem is to add empirically the cubic and quartic
$T_z$-terms to characterize the deviations from the IMME, but finding the
origin of these terms remains an unsolved difficulty. Based on a strategy
beyond the Wigner's first-order perturbation, we derive explicitly the cubic
and quartic $T_z$-terms. These terms are shown to be generated by the effective
charge-symmetry breaking and charge-independent breaking interactions in
nuclear medium combined with the Coulomb polarization effect. Calculations for
the $sd$- and lower $fp$-shells explore a systematical emergence of the cubic
$T_z$-term, suggesting a general deviation from the original IMME.
Intriguingly, the magnitude of the deviation exhibits an oscillation-like
behavior with mass number, modulated by the shell effect.

further considered, the magnetic configuration remains unchanged, but the
magnetization is enhanced in that direction, and reduced in other two
perpendicular orientations. Very similarly, a weak external magnetic field
normal to the disk plane cannot obviously affect the spin structure of the
nanodisk; however, when it is sufficiently strong, it can destroy the AFM
skyrmion completely. On the other hand, by increasing DM interaction so that
the disk diameter is a few times larger than the DM length, more self-organized
magnetic domains, such as vortices and strips, will be formed in the disk
plane. They evolve with decreasing temperature, however always symmetric about
a geometric axis of the square unit cell. We further find that in this case
introducing normal magnetic anisotropy gives rise to the re-construction of AFM
single-vortex structure or skyrmion on the disk plane, which provides a way to

theoretically the band-filling dependence of interatomic exchange interactions

electronic structure calculations in the Wannier basis, which is solved by
means of dynamical mean-field theory. After the solution, we calculate the
interatomic exchange interactions, by using the theory of infinitesimal spin
rotations, and evaluate $T_{\rm C}$. We argue that, as far as the Curie
temperature is concerned, the band filling realized in CrO$_2$ is far from
being the optimal one and much higher $T_{\rm C}$ can be obtained by decreasing
the number of $t_{2g}$ electrons ($n$) via the hole doping. We find that the
optimal $n$ is close to $1$, which should correspond to the case of VO$_2$,
provided that it is crystallized in the rutile structure. This finding was
confirmed by using the experimental rutile structure for both CrO$_2$ and
VO$_2$ and reflects the general tendency towards ferromagnetism for the
narrow-band compounds at the beginning of the band filling. In particular, our
results suggest that the strong ferromagnetism can be achieved in the thin

reconstruction of echo images (or velocity-delay maps) that encode information

galactic nuclei (AGNs). Such maps can constrain sophisticated physical models
for the BLR. The physical picture of the BLR is often theorized to be a
photoionized wind launched from the AGN accretion disk. Previously we showed
that the line-driven disk wind solution found in an earlier simulation by Proga
and Kallman is virialized over a large distance from the disk. This finding
implies that, according to this model, black hole masses can be reliably
estimated through reverberation mapping techniques. However, predictions of
echo images expected from line-driven disk winds are not available. Here, after
presenting the necessary radiative transfer methodology, we carry out the first
calculations of such predictions. We find that the echo images are quite
similar to other virialized BLR models such as randomly orbiting clouds and
thin Keplerian disks. We conduct a parameter survey exploring how echo images,
line profiles, and transfer functions depend on both the inclination angle and
the line opacity. We find that the line profiles are almost always single
peaked, while transfer functions tend to have tails extending to large time
delays. The outflow, despite being primarily equatorially directed, causes an
appreciable blue-shifted excess on both the echo image and line profile when
seen from lower inclinations ($i \lesssim 45^\circ$). This effect may be
observable in low ionization lines such as $\rm{H}\beta$.

localized dust opacity variations within the disks. These results suggest that
small scale axi-symmetric dust structures are likely to be common, as a result
of ubiquitous processes in disk evolution and planet formation. Compared with
recent spatially resolved observations of CO snowlines in these same disks, all

$\beta_3$, are underestimated by TDHF. A comparison with single-particle
excitations on the Hartree-Fock ground-state shows that the collective octupole
vibrations have their energy lowered due to attractive RPA residual
interaction.

of the EDisCS galaxy clusters with 0.5 < z < 0.8. Our cluster sample contains
172 spiral galaxies, and our control sample is composed of 96 field disc
galaxies. We deconvolve their ground-based V and I images obtained with FORS2
at the VLT with initial spatial resolutions between 0.4 and 0.8 arcsec to
achieve a final resolution of 0.1 arcsec with 0.05 arcsec pixels, which is
close to the resolution of the ACS at the HST. After removing the central
region of each galaxy to avoid pollution by the bulges, we measured the V-I
colours of the discs. We find that 50% of cluster spiral galaxies have disc V-I
colours redder by more than 1 sigma of the mean colours of their field
counterparts. This is well above the 16% expected for a normal distribution
centred on the field disc properties. The prominence of galaxies with red discs
depends neither on the mass of their parent cluster nor on the distance of the
galaxies to the cluster cores. Passive spiral galaxies constitute 20% of our
sample. These systems are not abnormally dusty. They are are made of old stars
and are located on the cluster red sequences. Another 24% of our sample is
composed of galaxies that are still active and star forming, but less so than
galaxies with similar morphologies in the field. These galaxies are naturally
located in the blue sequence of their parent cluster colour-magnitude diagrams.
The reddest of the discs in clusters must have stopped forming stars more than
~5 Gyr ago. Some of them are found among infalling galaxies, suggesting
preprocessing. Our results confirm that galaxies are able to continue forming
stars for some significant period of time after being accreted into clusters,
and suggest that star formation can decline on seemingly long (1 to 5 Gyr)
timescales.

of repetition~(BMST-R) codes, which can support a wide range of code rates but
maintain essentially the same encoding/decoding hardware structure. The
systematic BMST-R codes resemble the classical rate-compatible punctured
convolutional~(RCPC) codes, except that they are typically non-decodable by the
Viterbi algorithm due to the huge constraint length induced by the
block-oriented encoding process. The information sequence is partitioned
equally into blocks and transmitted directly, while their replicas are
interleaved and transmitted in a block Markov superposition manner. By taking
into account that the codes are systematic, we derive both upper and lower
bounds on the bit-error-rate~(BER) under maximum {\em a posteriori}~(MAP)
decoding. The derived lower bound reveals connections among BER, encoding
memory and code rate, which provides a way to design good systematic BMST-R
codes and also allows us to make trade-offs among efficiency, performance and
complexity. Numerical results show that:~1)~the proposed bounds are tight in
the high signal-to-noise ratio~(SNR) region;~2)~systematic BMST-R codes perform
well in a wide range of code rates, and~3)~systematic BMST-R codes outperform

a source document as a summary that can express the major theme of the
document. A general consensus on extractive summarization is that both
relevance and coverage are critical issues to address. The existing methods
designed to model coverage can be characterized by either reducing redundancy
or increasing diversity in the summary. Maximal margin relevance (MMR) is a
widely-cited method since it takes both relevance and redundancy into account
when generating a summary for a given document. In addition to MMR, there is
only a dearth of research concentrating on reducing redundancy or increasing
diversity for the spoken document summarization task, as far as we are aware.
Motivated by these observations, two major contributions are presented in this
paper. First, in contrast to MMR, which considers coverage by reducing
redundancy, we propose two novel coverage-based methods, which directly
increase diversity. With the proposed methods, a set of representative
sentences, which not only are relevant to the given document but also cover
most of the important sub-themes of the document, can be selected
automatically. Second, we make a step forward to plug in several
document/sentence representation methods into the proposed framework to further
enhance the summarization performance. A series of empirical evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

stored in the beam (in particular for hadron colliders such as LHC). Designing
a machine protection system requires an excellent understanding of accelerator
physics and operation to anticipate possible failures that could lead to
damage. Machine protection includes beam and equipment monitoring, a system to
safely stop beam operation (e.g. dumping the beam or stopping the beam at low
energy) and an interlock system providing the glue between these systems. The
most recent accelerator, the LHC, will operate with about 3x10 14 protons per
beam, corresponding to an energy stored in each beam of 360 MJ. This energy can
cause massive damage to accelerator equipment in case of uncontrolled beam
loss, and a single accident damaging vital parts of the accelerator could
interrupt operation for years. This article provides an overview of the
requirements for protection of accelerator equipment and introduces the various
protection systems. Examples are mainly from LHC, SNS and ESS.

unresolved binaries and errors, shows that the stellar surface population of
L1688 has a velocity dispersion $\sigma \sim$1.14$\pm$0.35 km s$^{-1}$ that is
consistent with being in virial equilibrium and is bound with a $\sim$80%

of $\sim$1.0 km s$^{-1}$pc$^{-1}$ in the northwest/southeast direction, which
is consistent with that found for the pre-stellar dense cores, and we discuss
the possibility of sequential and triggered star formation in L1688.

comparable to that of the variations of the refraction index in the Earth
atmosphere, what is usually termed as seeing in astronomical observations.
However, we assume that the camera is slow, so that our measurements are time
integrations of these modulated signals. In order to recover the time variation
of the seeing and obtain the Stokes parameters, we use the theory of compressed
sensing to solve the demodulation by impose a sparsity constraint on the
Fourier coefficients of the seeing. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
sub-Nyquist polarimeter using numerical simulations, both in the case without
noise and with noise. We show that a sensible modulation scheme is obtained by
randomly changing the fast axis of the modulators or their retardances in
specific ways. We finally demonstrate that the value of the Stokes parameters
can be recovered with great precision at almost maximum efficiency, although it
slightly degrades when the signal-to-noise ratio of the observations increase,
a consequence of the multiplexing under the presence of photon noise.

type-I burst episodes during the XMM-Newton observation, and for this reason we
studied separately the persistent and burst epochs. We described the persistent
emission with a combination of two soft thermal components, a cold thermal
Comptonization component (~2 keV) and an additional hard X-ray emission
described by a power-law (photon index ~2.3). The continuum components can be
associated with an accretion disc, the neutron star (NS) surface and a thermal
Comptonization emission coming out of an optically thick plasma region, while
the origin of the high energy tail is still under debate. In addition, a number
of broad (~0.1-0.4 keV) emission features likely associated to reflection
processes have been observed in the XMM-Newton data. The estimated 1.0-50 keV
unabsorbed luminosity of the source is ~5x10^37 erg/s, about 25% of the
Eddington limit assuming a 1.4 solar mass NS. We suggest that the spectral

from many other accreting X-ray millisecond pulsars which are usually found in
the hard state. Moreover, none of the observed type-I burst reached the

interpretation (HMI). Secondly, we observe that although a weighted symmetry
breaking (WSB) process was proposed in the PTI, to explain the actualization of
incipient transactions, no specific mechanism was actually provided to explain
why the weights of such symmetry breaking are precisely those given by the Born
rule. In other terms, PTI, similarly to decoherence theory, doesn't explain a
quantum measurement in a complete way, but just the transition from a pure
state to a fully reduced density matrix state. On the other hand, the recently
derived extended Bloch representation (EBR) - a specific implementation the HMI
- precisely provides such missing piece of explanation, i.e., a qualitative
description of the WSB as a process of actualization of hidden
measurement-interactions and, more importantly, a quantitative prediction of
the values of the associated weights that is compatible with the Born rule of
probabilistic assignment. Therefore, from the PTI viewpoint, the EBR provide
the missing link for a complete description of a quantum measurement. However,
EBR is in a sense more general than PTI, as it does not rely on the specific
notion of transaction, and therefore remains compatible with other physical
mechanisms that could be at the origin of the measurement-interactions.

at a critical temperature $T_c$ is described well by the BCS theory. In the
underdoped copper-oxides, high-temperature superconductivity condenses instead
from a nonconventional metallic ""pseudogap"" phase that exhibits a variety of
non-Fermi liquid properties. Recently, it has become clear that a charge
density wave (CDW) phase exists within the pseudogap regime, appearing at a
temperature $T_{CDW}$ just above $T_c$. The near coincidence of $T_c$ and
$T_{CDW}$, as well the coexistence and competition of CDW and superconducting
order below $T_c$, suggests that they are intimately related. Here we show that
the condensation of the superfluid from this unconventional precursor is
reflected in deviations from the predictions of BSC theory regarding the
recombination rate of quasiparticles. We report a detailed investigation of the
quasiparticle (QP) recombination lifetime, $\tau_{qp}$, as a function of
temperature and magnetic field in underdoped HgBa$_{2}$CuO$_{4+\delta}$
(Hg-1201) and YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+x}$ (YBCO) single crystals by ultrafast
time-resolved reflectivity. We find that $\tau_{qp}(T)$ exhibits a local
maximum in a small temperature window near $T_c$ that is prominent in
underdoped samples with coexisting charge order and vanishes with application
of a small magnetic field. We explain this unusual, non-BCS behavior by
positing that $T_c$ marks a transition from phase-fluctuating SC/CDW composite
order above to a SC/CDW condensate below. Our results suggest that the
superfluid in underdoped cuprates is a condensate of coherently-mixed

long-chain alcohol (of various types) sessile droplets in water is studied,
disentangling diffusive and convective contributions. The latter can arise for
high solubilities of the alcohol, as the density of the alcohol-water mixture
is then considerably less as that of pure water, giving rise to buoyancy driven
convection. The convective flow around the droplets is measured, using
micro-particle image velocimetry ($\mu$PIV) and the schlieren technique. When
nondimensionalizing the system, we find a universal $Sh\sim Ra^{1/4}$ scaling
relation for all alcohols (of different solubilities) and all droplets in the
convective regime. Here Sh is the Sherwood number (dimensionless mass flux) and
Ra the Rayleigh number (dimensionless density difference between clean and
alcohol-saturated water). This scaling implies the scaling relation $\tau_c
\sim R^{5/4}$ of the convective dissolution time $\tau_c$, which is found to
agree with experimental data. We show that in the convective regime the plume
Reynolds number (the dimensionless velocity) of the detaching alcohol-saturated
plume follows $Re_p \sim Sc^{-1} Ra^{5/8}$, which is confirmed by the $\mu$PIV
data. Here, Sc is the Schmidt number. The convective regime exists when $Ra >
Ra_t$, where $Ra_t = 12$ is the transition Ra-number as extracted from the

be modeled by wind-driven outflows at $\sim$ 20$\arcdeg$ inclined from the
plane of the sky. Close to the protostars the CO polarization, at an angular
resolution of $\sim$$2\farcs3$, has a position angle approximately parallel to
the magnetic field direction inferred from the dust polarizations. The CO
polarization direction appears to vary smoothly from an hourglass field around
the core to an arc-like morphology wrapping around the outflow, suggesting a
helical structure of magnetic fields that inherits the poloidal fields at the
launching point and consists of toroidal fields at a farther distance of
outflow. The helical magnetic field is consistent with the theoretical
expectations for launching and collimating outflows from a magnetized rotating
disk. Considering that the CO polarized emission is mainly contributed from the
low-velocity and low-resolution data, the helical magnetic field is likely a
product of the wind-envelope interaction in the wind-driven outflows. The CO
data reveal a PA of $\sim$ 30$\arcdeg$ deflection in the outflows. The
variation in the CO polarization angle seems to correlate with the deflections.
We speculate that the helical magnetic field contributes to $\sim$ 10$\arcdeg$
deflection of the outflows by means of Lorenz force.

of full waveform inversion (FWI) in the acoustic regime. The low frequencies
help determine the kinematically relevant, low-wavenumber components of the
velocity model, which are in turn needed to avoid convergence of FWI to
spurious local minima. However, acquiring data below 2 or 3 Hz from the field
is a challenging and expensive task. In this paper we explore the possibility
of synthesizing the low frequencies computationally from high-frequency data,
and use the resulting prediction of the missing data to seed the frequency
sweep of FWI. As a signal processing problem, bandwidth extension is a very
nonlinear and delicate operation. It requires a high-level interpretation of
bandlimited seismic records into individual events, each of which is
extrapolable to a lower (or higher) frequency band from the non-dispersive
nature of the wave propagation model. We propose to use the phase tracking
method for the event separation task. The fidelity of the resulting
extrapolation method is typically higher in phase than in amplitude. To
demonstrate the reliability of bandwidth extension in the context of FWI, we
first use the low frequencies in the extrapolated band as data substitute, in
order to create the low-wavenumber background velocity model, and then switch
to recorded data in the available band for the rest of the iterations. The
resulting method, EFWI for short, demonstrates surprising robustness to the
inaccuracies in the extrapolated low frequency data. With two synthetic
examples calibrated so that regular FWI needs to be initialized at 1 Hz to
avoid local minima, we demonstrate that FWI based on an extrapolated [1, 5] Hz
band, itself generated from data available in the [5, 15] Hz band, can produce
reasonable estimations of the low wavenumber velocity models.

artificial collisions modeled through the Lenard-Bernstein operator [A. Lenard
and I. B. Bernstein, Phys. Rev. 112, 1456-1459 (1958)]. By decomposing the
linear Vlasov-Poisson system in the Fourier-Hermite space, the recurrence
problem is investigated in the linear regime of the damping of a Langmuir wave
and of the onset of the bump-on-tail instability. The analysis is then
confirmed and extended to the nonlinear regime through a Eulerian collisional
Vlasov-Poisson code. It is found that, despite being routinely used, an
artificial collisionality is not a viable way of preventing recurrence in
numerical simulations without compromising the kinetic nature of the solution.
Moreover, it is shown how numerical effects associated to the generation of
fine velocity scales, can modify the physical features of the system evolution
even in nonlinear regime. This means that filamentation-like phenomena, usually
associated with low amplitude fluctuations contexts, can play a role even in
nonlinear regime.

oscillatory solutions are achieved with models extending to the poles, but the
magnetic field is strongly concentrated near the poles and the oscillation
period is very long. By introducing radial shear and a damping term mimicking

follows the Parker--Yoshimura rule. Oscillatory solutions in the weak shear

sub-wavelength confinement, and has led to the demonstration and control of
Brillouin scattering in photonic structures such as nano-scale optical
waveguides and cavities. Besides the small optical mode volume, two physical
mechanisms come into play simultaneously: a volume effect caused by the strain
induced refractive index perturbation (known as photo-elasticity), and a
surface effect caused by the shift of the optical boundaries due to mechanical
vibrations. As a result proper material and structure engineering allows one to
control each contribution individually. In this paper, we experimentally
demonstrate the perfect cancellation of Brillouin scattering by engineering a
silica nanowire with exactly opposing photo-elastic and moving-boundary
effects. This demonstration provides clear experimental evidence that the
interplay between the two mechanisms is a promising tool to precisely control
the photon-phonon interaction, enhancing or suppressing it.

tradition of Physiologically Structured Population Models, the formulation
starts on the individual level. Influences from the `outside world' on an
individual are captured by environmental variables. These environmental
variables are population level quantities. A key characteristic of the network
models is that individuals can be decomposed into a number of conditionally
independent components: each individual has a fixed number of `binding sites'
for partners. The Markov chain dynamics of binding sites are described by only
a few equations. In particular, individual-level probabilities are obtained
from binding-site-level probabilities by combinatorics while population-level
quantities are obtained by averaging over individuals in the population. Thus
we are able to characterize population-level epidemiological quantities, such
as $R_0$, $r$, the final size, and the endemic equilibrium, in terms of the
corresponding variables.

incompatibility with cosmological observations and fine-tuning of the
observer's location. Further analysis of these issues indicates that they could
be resolved by models that are compatible with the supernova Ia data, but less
inhomogeneous than those that have been presented in the literature so far. We
study if such models exist by employing the degrees of freedom of the LTB
models in a novel manner. We discovered two scenarios which may meet the
expectations, but extensive numerical and analytical investigation showed them
inviable. We extended our studies to the $\Lambda$LTB models, which generalizes
the LTB models by including a non-zero cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in
Einsteins equations. This adds an additional degree of freedom for the earlier
scenarios and introduces a new scenario capable of meeting the expectations.
However, extensive numerical and analytical investigation reveals that
inclusion of $\Lambda$ does not enhance the viability of the models. We
identify the lack of degrees of freedom to be the reason for the unviability.
However, the method presented here can be generalized to models including more
degrees of freedom, like the Szekeres models, which have more promise to
overcome the issues in the LTB models.

  of elemental Sn in the form of thin nanowires",,,,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sn is a well-known classical superconductor on the border between type I and
type II with critical temperature of 3.722K and critical field of 0.031T. We
show by means of specific heat and electric magneto-transport data that its
critical parameters can be dramatically increased if it is brought in the form
of loosely bound bundles of thin nanowires. The specific heat displays a
pronounced double phase transition at 3.7K and 5.5K, which we attribute to the
inner 'bulk' contribution of the nanowires and to the surface contribution,
respectively. The latter is visible only because of the large volume fraction
of the surface layer in relation to their bulk inner volume. The upper
transition coincides with the onset of the resistive transition, while zero
resistance is gradually approached below the lower transition. The large
coherence length of 230nm at 0K likely actuates a Josephson coupling between
adjacent neighboring nanowires and thus suppresses the effect of 1D phase
fluctuations along the nanowires, and stabilizes 3D phase coherence throughout
the entire network with zero resistance. A magnetic field of more than 3T is
required to restore the normal state, which means that the critical field is
enhanced by about two orders of magnitude with respect to Sn in its bulk form.

datasets in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud, as well as the development of
query processing infrastructures to access these data in a federated fashion.
However, different experimental studies have shown that availability of LOD
datasets cannot be always ensured, being RDF data replication required for
envisioning reliable federated query frameworks. Albeit enhancing data
availability, RDF data replication requires synchronization and conflict
resolution when replicas and source datasets are allowed to change data over
time, i.e., co-evolution management needs to be provided to ensure consistency.
In this paper, we tackle the problem of RDF data co-evolution and devise an
approach for conflict resolution during co-evolution of RDF datasets. Our
proposed approach is property-oriented and allows for exploiting semantics
about RDF properties during co-evolution management. The quality of our
approach is empirically evaluated in different scenarios on the DBpedia-live
dataset. Experimental results suggest that proposed proposed techniques have a
positive impact on the quality of data in source datasets and replicas.

  Accelerate Search",,,,,"cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Emerging technologies present opportunities for system designers to meet the
challenges presented by competing trends of big data analytics and limitations
on CMOS scaling. Specifically, memristors are an emerging high-density
technology where the individual memristors can be used as storage or to perform
computation. The voltage applied across a memristor determines its behavior
(storage vs. compute), which enables a configurable memristor substrate that
can embed computation with storage.
  This paper explores accelerating point and range search queries as instances
of the more general configurable combined compute and storage capabilities of
memristor arrays. We first present MemCAM, a configurable memristor-based
content addressable memory for the cases when fast, infrequent searches over
large datasets are required. For frequent searches, memristor lifetime becomes
a concern. To increase memristor array lifetime we introduce hybrid data
structures that combine trees with MemCAM using conventional CMOS
processor/cache hierarchies for the upper levels of the tree and configurable
memristor technologies for lower levels.
  We use SPICE to analyze energy consumption and access time of memristors and
use analytic models to evaluate the performance of configurable hybrid data
structures. The results show that with acceptable energy consumption our
configurable hybrid data structures improve performance of search intensive
applications and achieve lifetime in years or decades under continuous queries.
Furthermore, the configurability of memristor arrays and the proposed data
structures provide opportunities to tune the trade- off between performance and
lifetime and the data structures can be easily adapted to future memristors or
other technologies with improved endurance.

cases. It can be observed that movement patterns are not constant, but vary
across time and space. In this work,we characterize such spatio-temporal
patterns with an innovative combination of two separate approaches that have
been utilized for studying human mobility in the past. First, by using
non-negative tensor factorization (NTF), we are able to cluster human behavior
based on spatio-temporal dimensions. Second, for understanding these clusters,
we propose to use HypTrails, a Bayesian approach for expressing and comparing
hypotheses about human trails. To formalize hypotheses we utilize data that is
publicly available on the Web, namely Foursquare data and census data provided
by an open data platform. By applying this combination of approaches to taxi
data in Manhattan, we can discover and explain different patterns in human
mobility that cannot be identified in a collective analysis. As one example, we
can find a group of taxi rides that end at locations with a high number of
party venues (according to Foursquare) on weekend nights. Overall, our work
demonstrates that human mobility is not one-dimensional but rather contains
different facets both in time and space which we explain by utilizing online
data. The findings of this paper argue for a more fine-grained analysis of
human mobility in order to make more informed decisions for e.g., enhancing
urban structures, tailored traffic control and location-based recommender
systems.

outer main belt, and resulting from a catastrophic collision that took place
2.5$\pm$1.0 Gyr ago. Within the old Themis family a young sub-family, Beagle,
formed less than 10 Myr ago, has been identified. We present the results of a
spectroscopic survey in the visible and near infrared range of 22 Themis and 8
Beagle families members. The Themis members investigated exhibit a wide range
of spectral behaviors, while the younger Beagle family members look spectrally
bluer with a smaller spectral slope variability. The best meteorite spectral
analogues found for both Themis and Beagle families members are carbonaceous
chondrites having experienced different degrees of aqueous alteration,
prevalently CM2 but also CV3 and CI, and some of them are chondrite samples
being unusual or heated. We extended the spectral analysis including the data
available in the literature on Themis and Beagle families members, and we
looked for correlations between spectral behavior and physical parameters using
the albedo and size values derived from the WISE data. The analysis of this
larger sample confirm the spectral diversity within the Themis family and that
Beagle members tend to be bluer and to have an higher albedo. The differences
between the two family may be partially explained by space weathering
processes, which act on these primitive surfaces in a similar way than on
S-type asteroids, i.e. producing reddening and darkening. However we see
several Themis members having albedos and spectral slopes similar to the young
Beagle members. Alternative scenarios are proposed including heterogeneity in
the parent body having a compositional gradient with depth, and/or the survival
of projectile fragments having a different composition than the parent body.

observed in 2015 June/July up to a level of 50 Crab in the hard X-ray domain.
At this level of photon flux, an instrument's behavior may be severely tested
and some instrumental artifacts could affect the data analysis. We are
interested in the SPI instrument aboard the INTEGRAL mission and have performed
thorough checks to ensure a correct handling of the data. By analyzing the
observations throughout the outburst, we have observed that the high energy
domain (above 500 keV) sometimes exhibits unexpected features which are worth
careful examination. Spurious triggers are known to affect the MeV region and
we suspected that this phenomenon could be accentuated by the huge photon flux.
We have investigated this issue, specifically during high flux periods and
actually found that artificial high energy bumps may appear with the current
standard analysis procedure. However, if the specific selection events usually
used in the 650-2200 keV energy is applied down to 450 keV, the spurious noise
and the associated spectral features are removed. We present how to obtain
reliable spectral results on the high energy emission of V404 Cyg at extreme
flux levels and demonstrate that with the correct configuration, the hard X-ray
emission, up to a few MeV, is modeled by a two component model as observed in
Cyg X-1 and for V404 Cygni itself at lower flux levels.

varying mostly with the depth on the tissue. Besides, the biomechanical
response of each layer of the articular cartilage differs from the neighbouring
ones, evolving through thickness as a function of the distribution, density and
orientation of the collagen fibres. Based on a finite element implementation, a
new continuum formulation is proposed to describe the remodelling and
reorientation of the collagen fibres under arbitrary mechanical loads: the
cartilaginous tissue is modelled based on a hyperelastic formulation, being the
ground isotropic matrix described by a neo-Hookean law and the fibrillar
anisotropic part modelled by a new anisotropic formulation introduced for the
first time in the present work, in which both reorientation and remodelling are
taken into account. To characterize the orientation of fibres, a structure
tensor is defined to represent the expected distribution and orientation of
fibres around a reference direction. The isotropic and anisotropic constitutive
parameters were determined by the good validation of the numerical models with
the experimental data available from the literature. Considering the effect of
realistic collagen fibre reorientation in the cartilage tissue, the remodelling
algorithm associated with a distribution of fibres model showed accurate
results with few numerical calculations.

covering: (i) molecular rotation-libration in the cuboctahedral cavity; (ii)
drift and diffusion of large electron and hole polarons; (iii) transport of
charged ionic defects. These processes give rise to a range of properties that
are unconventional for photovoltaic materials, including frequency-dependent
permittivity, low electron-hole recombination rates, and current-voltage

initio molecular dynamic and Monte Carlo techniques - have been combined with
neutron scattering and ultra-fast vibrational spectroscopy to qualify the
nature and timescales of the motions. Recent experimental evidence and
theoretical models for simultaneous electron transport and ion transport in
these materials has been presented, suggesting they are mixed-mode conductors
with similarities to metal oxide perovskites developed for battery and fuel
cell applications. We expound on the implications of these effects for the
photovoltaic action. The temporal behaviour found in hybrid perovskites
introduces a sensitivity in materials characterisation to the time and length
scale of the measurement, as well as the history of each sample. It also poses
significant challenges for accurate materials and device simulations. Herein,
we critically discuss the atomistic origin of the dynamic processes.

subjected to large radiation and stellar wind fluxes. In this paper,
hydrodynamic simulations of the planetary upper atmosphere and its interaction
with the stellar wind are carried out to understand the possible flow regimes
and how they affect the Lyman-alpha transmission spectrum. Following Tremblin
and Chiang, charge exchange reactions are included to explore the role of
energetic atoms as compared to thermal particles. In order to understand the
role of the tail as compared to the leading edge of the planetary gas, the
simulations were carried out under axisymmetry, and photoionization and stellar
wind electron impact ionization reactions were included to limit the extent of
the neutrals away from the planet. By varying the planetary gas temperature,
two regimes are found. At high temperature, a supersonic planetary wind is
found, which is turned around by the stellar wind and forms a tail behind the
planet. At lower temperatures, the planetary wind is shut off when the stellar
wind penetrates inside where the sonic point would have been. In this regime
mass is lost by viscous interaction at the boundary between planetary and
stellar wind gases. Absorption by cold hydrogen atoms is large near the
planetary surface, and decreases away from the planet as expected. The hot
hydrogen absorption is in an annulus and typically dominated by the tail, at
large impact parameter, rather than by the thin leading edge of the mixing
layer near the substellar point.

separate frequency (f_{x}), the lifetime of each burst is anti-correlated to

normal branches are drifting obviously faster than the RS branches. The type
III pairs occurring in flare impulsive phase have lower separate frequency,
longer lifetime, wider frequency gap, and slower frequency drift than that

electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) effect in metasurfaces prevents all surface modes
from propagating in a certain frequency band. While metasurfaces provide a
number of important applications in microwave antennas and antenna arrays,
their features are also highly suitable for MRI applications. In this work we
manufacture and experimentally study finite samples based on mushroom-type EBG
metasurfaces and employ them for suppression of inter-element coupling in
dipole transmit coil arrays for body imaging at 7T. We show experimentally that
employment of the samples EBG leads to reduction of coupling between adjacent
closely-spaced dipole antenna elements of a 7T transmit/receive body array,
which reduces scattering losses in neighboring channels and thereby improves
the B1+ efficiency. The setup consists of two fractionated dipole antennas
previously designed by the authors for body imaging at 7 Tesla. These are
placed on top of a body-mimicking phantom and equipped with the manufactured
finite-size sample of the metasurface tuned to have EBG properties at the
Larmor frequency of 298 MHz. To improve the detection range of the B1+ field
distribution of the top elements, four additional elements were positioned
along the bottom side of the phantom. Scattering matrix measurements show that
coupling between the two top elements is indeed reduced while the measurements
performed on a 7T MRI machine confirm the array's B1+ efficiency improvement
due to reduced scattering losses. This study provides a tool for the decoupling
of dipole antennas in ultrahigh field transmit arrays, possibly resulting in
denser element placement and/or larger subject-element spacing.

have adopted FRB 110220, for which the emitted pulse energy is estimated to be
$E_0 = 5.4 \times 10^{33}J$, as the reference event. The formalism requires us
to assume models for (1) pulse broadening due to scattering in the ionized
inter-galactic medium - we consider two different models for this, (2) the
frequency spectrum of the emitted pulse - we consider a power law model
$E_{\nu} \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$ with $-5 \leq \alpha \leq 5$, and (3) the
comoving number density of the FRB occurrence rate $n(E,w_i,z)$ - we ignore the
z dependence and assume a fixed intrinsic pulse width $w_i = 1$ms for all the
FRBs. The distribution of the emitted pulse energy $E$ is modelled through (a)
a delta-function where all the FRBs have the same energy $E = E_0$ , and (b) a
Schechter luminosity function where the energies have a spread around $E_0$.
The models are all normalized using the 4 FRBs detected by Thornton et al.
(2013). Our model predictions for the Parkes telescope are all consistent with
the inferred redshift distribution of the fourteen FRBs detected there to date.
We also find that scattering places an upper limit on the redshift of the FRBs
detectable by a given telescope; for the Parkes telescope this is $z \sim 2$.
Considering the upcoming Ooty Wide Field Array, we predict a FRB detection rate
of $\sim 0.01$ to $\sim 10^3$ per day.

of $f^F$, $f^D$, $f^S$ coupling constants in $SU(3)$ invariant interaction
Lagrangian of the vector-meson nonet with $1/2^+$ octet baryons. The latter,
together with universal vector-meson coupling constants $f_V$, play an
essential role in a prediction of $1/2^+$ octet hyperon electromagnetic form
factors behaviors.

  strategies","7 pages, 5 figures",,,,"q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chances of a gambler are always lower than chances of a casino in the case of
an ideal, mathematically perfect roulette, if the capital of the gambler is
limited and the minimum and maximum allowed bets are limited by the casino.
However, a realistic roulette is not ideal: the probabilities of realisation of
different numbers slightly deviate. Describing this deviation by a statistical
distribution with a width {\delta} we find a critical {\delta} that equalizes
chances of gambler and casino in the case of a simple strategy of the game: the
gambler always puts equal bets to the last N numbers. For up-critical {\delta}
the expected return of the roulette becomes positive. We show that the dramatic
increase of gambler's chances is a manifestation of bunching of numbers in a
non-ideal roulette. We also estimate the critical starting capital needed to
ensure the low risk game for an indefinite time.

Hubber","Perturbation growth in accreting filaments",,,"10.1093/mnras/stw407",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We use smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the growth
of perturbations in infinitely long, initially sub-critical but accreting
filaments. The growth of these perturbations leads to filament fragmentation
and the formation of cores. Most previous work on this subject has been
confined to the growth and fragmentation of equilibrium filaments and has found
that there exists a preferential fragmentation length scale which is roughly 4
times the filament's diameter. Our results show a more complicated dispersion
relation with a series of peaks linking perturbation wavelength and growth
rate. These are due to gravo-acoustic oscillations along the longitudinal axis
during the sub-critical phase of growth. The positions of the peaks in growth
rate have a strong dependence on both the mass accretion rate onto the filament
and the temperature of the gas. When seeded with a multi-wavelength density
power spectrum there exists a clear preferred core separation equal to the
largest peak in the dispersion relation. Our results allow one to estimate a
minimum age for a filament which is breaking up into regularly spaced
fragments, as well as a maximum accretion rate. We apply the model to
observations of filaments in Taurus by Tafalla & Hacar (2015) and find
accretion rates consistent with those estimated by Palmeirim et al. (2013).

  Decode-and-Forward and Network Coding in Two-Way Relay Channels","20 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we adopt the relay selection (RS) protocol proposed by
Bletsas, Khisti, Reed and Lippman (2006) with Enhanced Dynamic
Decode-and-Forward (EDDF) and network coding (NC) system in a two-hop two-way
multi-relay network. All nodes are single-input single-output (SISO) and
half-duplex, i.e., they cannot transmit and receive data simultaneously. The
outage probability is analyzed and we show comparisons of outage probability
with various scenarios under Rayleigh fading channel. Our results show that the
relay selection with EDDF and network coding (RS-EDDF&NC) scheme has the best
performance in the sense of outage probability upon the considered
decode-and-forward (DF) relaying if there exist sufficiently relays. In
addition, the performance loss is large if we select a relay at random. This
shows the importance of relay selection strategies.
