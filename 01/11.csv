from its production rules. A tag system's evolution is first divided into
stages called `epochs' in which the tag system evolves monotonously. The
distribution of symbols in the queue at the beginning of each epoch determines
the tag system's large-scale properties, including growth rate and string
densities, during that epoch. We derive the symbol distribution for the next
epoch from the distribution for the current one, using this to make predictions
over multiple successive epochs. Finally, we compare predictions that were
obtained with this method to computer simulations and find that it retains
great accuracy over several epochs.

  Bose-Einstein condensates","7 pages, 7 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well known that in the presence of a ring cavity the light scattering
from a uniform atomic ensemble can become unstable resulting in the collective
atomic recoil lasing. This is the result of a positive feedback due to the
cavity. We propose to add an additional electronic feedback loop based on the
photodetection of the scattered light. The advantage is a great flexibility in
choosing the feedback algorithm, since manipulations with electric signals are
very well developed. In this paper we address the application of such a
feedback to atoms in the Bose-Einstein condensed state and explore the quantum
noise due to the incoherent feedback action. We show that although the feedback
based on the photodetection does not change the local stability of the initial
uniform distribution with respect to small disturbances, it reduces the region
of attraction of the uniform equilibrium. The feedback-induced nonlinearity
enables quantum fluctuations to bring the system out of the stability region
and cause an exponential growth even if the uniform state is globally stable
without the feedback. Using numerical solution of the feedback master equation
we show that there is no feedback-induced noise in the quadratures of the
excited atomic and light modes. The feedback loop, however, introduces
additional noise into the number of quanta of these modes. Importantly, the
feedback opens an opportunity to position the modulated BEC inside a cavity as
well as tune the phase of scattered light. This can find applications in
precision measurements and quantum simulations.

Integrated optics allows one to perform experiments based upon multiport

quantum optics, especially for fields of undefined intensities.

has been widely reported in experiment. The probability density function (PDF)
of cell lengths has been variously described by exponential and lognormal
functions. While temperature, population density and growth rate have all been
shown to affect E. coli cell size distributions, and recent models have
validated a link between growth rate and cell size through DNA replication,
cell size variability is thought to emerge from growth rate variability. A
mechanistic link that could distinguish the source of stochasticity, could
improve our understanding of cell size regulation. Here, we have developed a
population dynamics model of individual cell division based on the BCD, birth,
chromosome replication and division model, with DNA replication based on the
Cooper and Helmstetter (CH) multi-fork replication. In our model, stochasticity
in the model arises solely from the dynamics of DNA replication forks. We model
the forks as two-state systems: stalled and recovered. Our model predicts an
increase in cell size variability with growth rate, consistent with previous
experimental reports. We perturb the model to test the effect of increased
replication fork (RF) stalling frequency, or uncoupling RF stalling from the
cell-division machinery. Indeed, despite ignoring DNA and protein segregation
asymmetry, the model can faithfully reproduce quantitative changes in cell size
distributions. In our model, multi-fork replication produces multiplicative
'noise' and provides a mechanism linking growth rate and cell size variability.

of 35 m $\rm s^{-1}$ can be reached in this magnitude range, offering the
possibility to further extend the variability analysis into the substellar

prominent in statistical learning theory, particularly due to the widespread
adoption of Bayesian nonparametric methodologies for a host of models and
applications. Much of the existing literature in the learning community focuses
on processes possessing some form of computationally tractable conjugacy as is
the case for the beta and gamma processes (and, via normalization, the
Dirichlet process). For these processes, proofs of conjugacy and requisite
derivation of explicit computational formulae for posterior density parameters
are idiosyncratic to the stochastic process in question. As such, Bayesian
Nonparametric models are currently available for a limited number of conjugate
pairs, e.g. the Dirichlet-multinomial and beta-Bernoulli process pairs. In each
of these above cases the likelihood process belongs to the class of discrete
exponential family distributions. The exclusion of continuous likelihood
distributions from the known cases of Bayesian Nonparametric Conjugate models
stands as a disparity in the researcher's toolbox.
  In this paper we first address the problem of obtaining a general
construction of prior distributions over infinite dimensional spaces possessing
distributional properties amenable to conjugacy. Second, we bridge the divide
between the discrete and continuous likelihoods by illustrating a canonical
construction for stochastic processes whose Levy measure densities are from
positive exponential families, and then demonstrate that these processes in
fact form the prior, likelihood, and posterior in a conjugate family. Our
canonical construction subsumes known computational formulae for posterior
density parameters in the cases where the likelihood is from a discrete
distribution belonging to an exponential family.

recombination, carrier multiplication via impact ionization and hot carrier
luminescence - occurs when optically excited electrons in a material undergo
rapid electron-electron scattering to redistribute excess energy and reach
electronic thermal equilibrium. Due to extremely short time and length scales,
the measurement and manipulation of electron thermalization in nanoscale
devices remains challenging even with the most advanced ultrafast laser
techniques. Here, we overcome this challenge by leveraging the atomic thinness
of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials in order to introduce a highly
tunable electron transfer pathway that directly competes with electron
thermalization. We realize this scheme in a graphene-boron nitride-graphene
(G-BN-G) vdW heterostructure, through which optically excited carriers are
transported from one graphene layer to the other. By applying an interlayer
bias voltage or varying the excitation photon energy, interlayer carrier
transport can be controlled to occur faster or slower than the intralayer
scattering events, thus effectively tuning the electron thermalization pathways
in graphene. Our findings, which demonstrate a novel means to probe and
directly modulate electron energy transport in nanoscale materials, represent
an important step toward designing and implementing novel optoelectronic and
energy-harvesting devices with tailored microscopic properties.

correlates best with $L_{H\alpha}/L_{H\alpha}^*(z)$. While $L_{H\alpha}<L_{\rm

the star's atmospheric and fundamental parameters. Spectropolarimetric
observations with FORS2 and HARPSpol are analysed using two independent
approaches to quantify the magnetic field strength. A high-S/N FLAMES/GIRAFFE
spectrum is analysed using a hybrid non-LTE model atmosphere technique.
Comparison with stellar evolution models constrains the fundamental parameters
of the star. We obtain a firm detection of a surface averaged longitudinal
magnetic field with a maximum amplitude of about 1 kG. Assuming a dipolar
configuration of the magnetic field, this implies a dipolar field strength
larger than 3.3 kG. Moreover, the large amplitude and fast variation (within
about 1 day) of the longitudinal magnetic field implies that CPD-57 3509 is
spinning very fast despite its apparently slow projected rotational velocity.
The star should be able to support a centrifugal magnetosphere, yet the
spectrum shows no sign of magnetically confined material; in particular,
emission in H{\alpha} is not observed. Apparently, the wind is either not
strong enough for enough material to accumulate in the magnetosphere to become
observable or, alternatively, some leakage process leads to loss of material

yields an effective temperature and a logarithmic surface gravity of 23750+-250
K and 4.05+-0.10, respectively, and a surface helium fraction of 0.28+-0.02 by

Coxeter groups. They arise naturally in the study of the Bruhat order, of
certain Iwahori-Hecke algebra modules, and of orbit closures in flag varieties.
Specifically, to any twisted involutions $x$, $y$ in a Coxeter group $W$ with
automorphism $*$, we associate a set of involution words
$\hat{\mathcal{R}}_*(x,y)$. This set is the disjoint union of the reduced words
of a set of group elements $\mathcal{A}_*(x,y)$, which we call the atoms of $y$
relative to $x$. The atoms, in turn, are contained in a larger set
$\mathcal{B}_*(x,y) \subset W$ with a similar definition, whose elements we
refer to as Hecke atoms. Our main results concern some interesting properties
of the sets $\hat{\mathcal{R}}_*(x,y)$ and $\mathcal{A}_*(x,y) \subset
\mathcal{B}_*(x,y)$. For finite Coxeter groups we prove that
$\mathcal{A}_*(1,y)$ consists of exactly the minimal-length elements $w \in W$
such that $w^* y \leq w$ in Bruhat order, and conjecture a more general
property for arbitrary Coxeter groups. In type $A$, we describe a simple set of
conditions characterizing the sets $\mathcal{A}_*(x,y)$ for all involutions
$x,y \in S_n$, giving a common generalization of three recent theorems of Can,
Joyce, and Wyser. We show that the atoms of a fixed involution in the symmetric
group (relative to $x=1$) naturally form a graded poset, while the Hecke atoms
surprisingly form an equivalence class under the ""Chinese relation"" studied by
Cassaigne, Espie, et al. These facts allow us to recover a recent theorem of Hu
and Zhang describing a set of ""braid relations"" spanning the involution words
of any self-inverse permutation. We prove a generalization of this result
giving an analogue of Matsumoto's theorem for involution words in arbitrary
Coxeter groups.

structures, including gaps and rings, which can result from planetary
companions shaping the disc by their gravitational influence. Currently there
are no tools available to determine the architecture of potential companions
from disc observations. Recent work by Rodigas et al. (2014) presents how one
can estimate the maximum mass and minimum semi major axis of a hidden planet
empirically from the width of the disc in scattered light. In this work, we use
the predictions of Rodigas et al. applied to two debris discs HD 202628 and HD
207129. We aim to test if the predicted orbits of the planets can explain the
features of their debris disc, such as eccentricity and sharp inner edge. We
first run dynamical simulations using the predicted planetary parameters of
Rodigas et al., and then numerically search for better parameters. Using a
modified N-body code including radiation forces, we perform simulations over a
broad range of planet parameters and compare synthetics images from our
simulations to the observations. We find that the observational features of HD
202628 can be reproduced with a planet five times smaller than expected,
located 30 AU beyond the predicted value, while the best match for HD 207129 is
for a planet located 5-10 AU beyond the predicted location with a smaller
eccentricity. We conclude that the predictions of Rodigas et al. provide a good
starting point but should be complemented by numerical simulations.

updates sent from a source node to a destination via a channel. A proper metric
for data freshness at the destination is the age-of-information, or simply age,
which is defined as how old the freshest received update is since the moment
that this update was generated at the source node (e.g., a sensor). A
reasonable update policy is the zero-wait policy, i.e., the source node submits
a fresh update once the previous update is delivered and the channel becomes
free, which achieves the maximum throughput and the minimum delay.
Surprisingly, this zero-wait policy does not always minimize the age. This
counter-intuitive phenomenon motivates us to study how to optimally control
information updates to keep the data fresh and to understand when the zero-wait
policy is optimal. We introduce a general age penalty function to characterize
the level of dissatisfaction on data staleness and formulate the average age
penalty minimization problem as a constrained semi-Markov decision problem
(SMDP) with an uncountable state space. We develop efficient algorithms to find
the optimal update policy among all causal policies, and establish sufficient
and necessary conditions for the optimality of the zero-wait policy. Our
investigation shows that the zero-wait policy is far from the optimum if (i)
the age penalty function grows quickly with respect to the age, (ii) the packet
transmission times over the channel are positively correlated over time, or
(iii) the packet transmission times are highly random (e.g., following a
heavy-tail distribution).

for the time integration of partial differential equations. Their main
advantages over more traditional schemes are computational efficiency and
superior geometric properties. In the presence of non-trivial boundary
conditions, however, splitting methods usually suffer from order reduction and
some additional loss of accuracy. For diffusion-reaction equations with
inhomogeneous oblique boundary conditions, a modification of the classic
second-order Strang splitting is proposed that successfully resolves the
problem of order reduction. The same correction also improves the accuracy of
the classic first-order Lie splitting. The proposed modification only depends
on the available boundary data and, in the case of non Dirichlet boundary
conditions, on the computed numerical solution. Consequently, this modification
can be implemented in an efficient way, which makes the modified splitting
schemes superior to their classic versions. The framework employed in our error
analysis also allows us to explain the fractional orders of convergence that
are often encountered for classic Strang splitting. Numerical experiments that
illustrate the theory are provided.

confined by a toroidal trap with a tight confinement in the radial direction.
Gross-Pitaevskii simulations show that solitons can be long living objects
passing through many collisional processes. We have observed quite different
behaviors depending on the soliton velocity. Very slow solitons, obtained by
perturbing the stationary solitonic profile, move with a constant angular
velocity until they collide elastically and move in the opposite direction
without showing any sign of lowering their energy. In this case the density
notches are always well separated and the fronts are sharp and straight. Faster
solitons present vortices around the notches, which play a central role during
the collisions. We have found that in these processes the solitons lose energy,
as the outgoing velocity turns out to be larger than the incoming one. To study
the dynamics, we model the gray soliton state with a free parameter that is
related to the soliton velocity. We further analyze the energy, soliton
velocity and turning points in terms of such a free parameter, finding that the
main features are in accordance with the infinite one-dimensional system.

comparing Allan variance plots of the residuals. The combined light curves for
each system, along with radial velocity measurements from the literature when

discoveries, predict global market trends, save energy, and develop educational
strategies. In some settings such as Genome Wide Association Studies or deep
learning, sheer size of data seems critical. When data is held distributedly by
many parties, they must share it to reap its full benefits.
  One obstacle to this revolution is the lack of willingness of different
parties to share data, due to reasons such as loss of privacy or competitive
edge. Cryptographic works address privacy aspects, but shed no light on
individual parties' losses/gains when access to data carries tangible rewards.
Even if it is clear that better overall conclusions can be drawn from
collaboration, are individual collaborators better off by collaborating?
Addressing this question is the topic of this paper.
  * We formalize a model of n-party collaboration for computing functions over
private inputs in which participants receive their outputs in sequence, and the
order depends on their private inputs. Each output ""improves"" on preceding
outputs according to a score function.
  * We say a mechanism for collaboration achieves collaborative equilibrium if
it ensures higher reward for all participants when collaborating (rather than
working alone). We show that in general, computing a collaborative equilibrium
is NP-complete, yet we design efficient algorithms to compute it in a range of
natural model settings.
  Our collaboration mechanisms are in the standard model, and thus require a
central trusted party; however, we show this assumption is unnecessary under
standard cryptographic assumptions. We show how to implement the mechanisms in
a decentralized way with new extensions of secure multiparty computation that
impose order/timing constraints on output delivery to different players, as
well as privacy and correctness.

is usually preferred than the respective time-domain raw data since it reveals
more compact presentation together with conspicuous temporal information over a
long time span. However, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) that creates
the spectrogram in general distorts the original signal and thereby limits the
capability of the associated speech enhancement techniques. In this study, we
propose a novel speech enhancement method that adopts the algorithms of
discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) and nonnegative matrix factorization
(NMF) in order to conquer the aforementioned limitation. In brief, the DWPT is
first applied to split a time-domain speech signal into a series of subband
signals without introducing any distortion. Then we exploit NMF to highlight
the speech component for each subband. Finally, the enhanced subband signals
are joined together via the inverse DWPT to reconstruct a noise-reduced signal
in time domain. We evaluate the proposed DWPT-NMF based speech enhancement
method on the MHINT task. Experimental results show that this new method
behaves very well in prompting speech quality and intelligibility and it
outperforms the convnenitional STFT-NMF based method.

transversal (Bt) magnetic induction components, as well as in the field line
inclination angle ({\alpha}) to the radial direction from the Sun center were.
The conclusion is that the most probable cause for the FE onset being the
trigger related to the flares and CME, as well as for Stage 1 of the filament
dramatic acceleration, is {\guillemotleft}magnetic flux
cancellation{\guillemotright} in several sites inside and around the filament
channel. We assumed that the flare and the stage of the filament fastest
acceleration are related to a spot emergence near the south-eastern filament
footpoint, in which the field polarity and value satisfy a possibility of this
field magnetic reconnection with the field surrounding the filament. We studied
in detail the time variations in the field line inclination angles within
different sites of the eruptive event. During the filament slow emergence, a
decrease in the field line inclination angles was revealed to occur in its
channel neighboring, whereas the field line inclination angles dramatically
grew in the neutral line neighboring within the flare region after the flare
onset. The flare ribbons at all the stages of their existence are shown to be
located under the photosphere sites with the field modulus local maxima and
with minima of the field line inclination angles. We show that, near the
photospheric magnetic field polarity inversion line (PIL), the azimuth
decreases after the flare onset, which means a decrease in the angle \b{eta}
between PIL and the magnetic induction vector projection onto the sky plane.

resources, and (ii) a decentralized model in which each consumer individually
owns and operates the integration and is capable of selling surplus electricity
back to the retailer in a net-metering setting.
  The two integration models are analyzed using a Stackelberg game in which the
utility is the leader in setting the retail price of electricity, and each
consumer schedules its demand by maximizing individual consumer surplus. The
solution of the Stackelberg game defines the Pareto front that characterizes
fundamental trade-offs between retail profit of the utility and consumer

  It is shown that, for both integration models, the centralized integration
uniformly improves retail profit. As the level of integration increases, the
proportion of benefits goes to the consumers increases. In contrast, the
consumer-based decentralized integration improves consumer surplus at the
expense of retail profit of the utility. For a profit regulated utility, the
consumer based integration may lead to smaller consumer surplus than that when
no renewable or storage is integrated at either the consumer or the retailer

topological phase transition enabling a desired dynamic control of Dirac

regime where device function is affected not only by the presence of individual
dopants, but more critically their position in the structure. The quantitative
determination of the positions of subsurface dopant atoms is an important issue
in a range of applications from channel doping in ultra-scaled transistors to
quantum information processing, and hence poses a significant challenge. Here,
we establish a metrology combining low-temperature scanning tunnelling
microscopy (STM) imaging and a comprehensive quantum treatment of the
dopant-STM system to pin-point the exact lattice-site location of sub-surface
dopants in silicon. The technique is underpinned by the observation that STM
images of sub surface dopants typically contain many atomic-sized features in
ordered patterns, which are highly sensitive to the details of the STM tip
orbital and the absolute lattice-site position of the dopant atom itself. We
demonstrate the technique on two types of dopant samples in silicon -- the
first where phosphorus dopants are placed with high precision, and a second
containing randomly placed arsenic dopants. Based on the quantitative agreement
between STM measurements and multi-million-atom calculations, the precise
lattice site of these dopants is determined, demonstrating that the metrology

astronomical spectra, including those of forming stars. Candidate carriers
include water ice, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), silicon carbide,
crystalline silicates or even carbonates. All are known constituents of cosmic
dust in one or more types of environments, though not necessarily together. In
this paper we present new ground-based 8-13 micron spectra of one evolved star,
several embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) and a background source lying
behind a large column of the interstellar medium (ISM) toward the Galactic
Centre. Our observations, obtained at a spectral resolution of approximately
100, are compared with previous lower resolution data, as well as data obtained
with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) on these and other targets. By
presenting a subset of a larger sample our aim is to establish the reality of
the feature and subsequently speculate on its carrier. All evidence points
toward crystalline silicate. For instance, the 11 micron band profile is well
matched with the emissivity of crystalline olivine. Furthermore, the apparent
association of the absorption feature with a sharp polarisation signature in
the spectrum of two previously reported cases suggests a carrier with a
relatively high band strength compared to amorphous silicates. If true, this
would either set back the evolutionary stage in which silicates are
crystallised, either to the embedded phase or even before within the ISM, or
else the silicates ejected from the outflows of evolved stars retain some of
their crystalline identity during their long residence in the ISM.

X-rays at energies between 25 keV and 300 keV, and in microwaves at frequencies
from a few GHz up to 34 GHz during an interval of one minute. The QPP X-ray

precessional magnetization orbits are excited with a current pulse with a

clearly detected in residuals obtained from the spectral fitting. This

with the conventional factor of 2, indicating that the heights of line forming

the Fokker-Plank (FP) equation. Since the transport coefficients, related to
drag and diffusion processes are the main ingredients in the FP equation, the
evolution of HQs is thus effectively controlled by them. At the initial stage
of the relativistic heavy ion collisions, asymptotic weak-coupling causes the
free-streaming motions of partons in the beam direction and the expansion in
transverse directions are almost frozen, hence an anisotropy in the momentum
space sets in. Since HQs are too produced in the same time therefore the study
of the effect of momentum anisotropy on the drag and diffusion coefficients
becomes advertently desirable. In this article we have thus studied the drag
and diffusion of HQs in the anisotropic medium and found that the presence of
the anisotropy reduces both drag and diffusion coefficients. In addition, the
anisotropy introduces an angular dependence to both the drag and diffusion
coefficients, as a result both coefficients get inflated when the partons are
moving transverse to the direction of anisotropy than parallel to the direction

304-1 by using two Suzaku observations during its 2010 August and 2012 January
X-ray outbursts. Pulsations at ~275 s were clearly detected in the light curves
from both the observations. Pulse profiles were found to be strongly
energy-dependent. During 2010 observation, prominent dips seen in soft X-ray
($\leq$10 keV) pulse profiles were found to be absent at higher energies.
However, during 2012 observation, the pulse profiles were complex due to the
presence of several dips. Significant changes in the shape of the pulse
profiles were detected at high energies ($>$35 keV). A phase shift of $\sim$0.3
was detected while comparing the phase of main dip in pulse profiles below and
above $\sim$35 keV. Broad-band energy spectrum of pulsar was well described by
a partially absorbed Negative and Positive power-law with Exponential cutoff
(NPEX) model with 6.4 keV iron line and a cyclotron absorption feature. Energy
of cyclotron absorption line was found to be $\sim$53 and 50 keV for 2010 and
2012 observations, respectively, indicating a marginal positive dependence on
source luminosity. Based on the results obtained from phase-resolved
spectroscopy, the absorption dips in the pulse profiles can be interpreted as
due to the presence of additional matter at same phases. Observed positive
correlation between cyclotron line energy and luminosity, and significant
pulse-phase variation of cyclotron parameters are discussed in the perspective
of theoretical models on cyclotron absorption line in X-ray pulsars.

quantify the diagonalness by means of operator norms. While the fixed points
for both generators are equivalent when no bound-states are allowed by the

eigenvalue once it reaches the fixed point. This finite momentum grid setup
provides an alternative derivation of the celebrated trace identities, as a by
product. The different effects due to either the Wilson or the Wegner

the solar corona, where finite-beta magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations serve
to mimic the flux rope formation stages, as well as their stable endstates.
These endstates represent twisted flux ropes where balancing Lorentz forces,
gravity and pressure gradients determine the full thermodynamic variation
throughout the flux rope. The obtained models are needed to quantify radiative
transfer in radio bands, and allow us to contrast weak to strong magnetic field
conditions. Field strengths of up to 100 G in the flux rope yield the radio
views dominated by optically thin free-free emission. The forming flux rope
shows clear morphological changes in its emission structure as it deforms from
an arcade to a flux rope, both on disk and at the limb. For an active region
filament channel with a field strength of up to 680 G in the flux rope,
gyroresonance emission (from the third-fourth gyrolayers) can be detected and
even dominates over free-free emission at the frequencies of up to 7 GHz.
Finally, we also show synthetic views on a simulated filament embedded within a
(weak-field) flux rope, resulting from an energetically consistent MHD
simulation. For this filament, synthetic views at the limb show clear
similarities with actual observations, and the transition from optically thick
(below 10 GHz) to optically thin emission can be reproduced. On the disk, its
dimension and temperature conditions are as yet not realistic enough to yield
the observed radio brightness depressions.

multi-input multi-output (MIMO) setup that has gained increasing traction in
meeting the high data-rate requirements of next-generation wireless systems.
For a given MIMO channel matrix, the optimality of beamforming with the
dominant right-singular vector (RSV) at the transmit end and with the matched
filter to the RSV at the receive end has been well-understood. When the channel
matrix can be accurately captured by a physical (geometric) scattering model
across multiple clusters/paths as is the case in mmW MIMO systems, we provide a
physical interpretation for this optimal structure: beam steering across the
different paths with appropriate power allocation and phase compensation. While
such an explicit physical interpretation has not been provided hitherto,
practical implementation of such a structure in a mmW system is fraught with
considerable difficulties (complexity as well as cost) as it requires the use
of per-antenna gain and phase control. This paper characterizes the loss in
received SNR with an alternate low-complexity beamforming solution that needs
only per-antenna phase control and corresponds to steering the beam to the
dominant path at the transmit and receive ends. While the loss in received SNR
can be arbitrarily large (theoretically), this loss is minimal in a large
fraction of the channel realizations reinforcing the utility of directional
beamforming as a good candidate solution for mmW MIMO systems.

source to be in an extraordinary state of persistent heavy obscuration. We
re-analyzed the archival grating spectra obtained by XMM-Newton and Chandra
between 1999 and 2007 in order to characterize the classic warm absorber (WA)
using consistent models and up-to-date photoionization codes and atomic physics
databases and to construct a baseline model that can be used as a template for
the WA in the 2013 observations. The WA in NGC 5548 is composed of 6 distinct
ionization phases outflowing in 4 kinematic regimes in the form of a stratified
wind with several layers intersected by our line of sight. If the changes in
the WA are solely due to ionization or recombination processes in response to
variations in the ionizing flux among the different observations, we are able
to estimate lower limits on the density of the WA, finding that the farthest
components are less dense and have a lower ionization. These limits are used to
put stringent upper limits on the distance of the WA components from the
central ionizing source, with the lowest ionization phases <50, <20, and <5 pc,
respectively, while the intermediately ionized components lie at <3.6 and <2.2
pc from the center, respectively. The highest ionization component is located
at ~0.6 pc or closer to the AGN central engine. The mass outflow rate summed
over all WA components is ~0.3 Msun/yr, about six times the nominal accretion
rate of the source. The total kinetic luminosity injected into the ISM is a
small fraction (~0.03%) of the bolometric luminosity of the source. After
adding the contribution of the UV absorbers, this value augments to ~0.2% of
the bolometric luminosity, well below the minimum amount of energy required by
current feedback models to regulate galaxy evolution.

on a powerful combinatorial gadget that can be used to prove integrality gap
results for many problem settings. We also consider the canonical LP augmented
with simple additional constraints (as suggested by Hartke). We provide several
evidences that these constraints improve the integrality gap of the canonical
LP: (i) Extreme points of the new LP are integral for some known tractable

presenting a $5/6$ integrality gap instance for the new LP.

of chondritic porous interplanetary dust particles (CPIDPs). Aims. In the light
of this new association, we re-examine the surface composition of a sample of
asteroids belonging to the Themis family in order to place new constraints on
the formation and evolution of its parent body. Methods. We acquired NIR
spectral data for 15 members of the Themis family and complemented this dataset
with existing spectra in the visible and mid-infrared ranges to perform a
thorough analysis of the composition of the family. Assuming end-member
minerals and particle sizes (<2\mum) similar to those found in CPIDPs, we used
a radiative transfer code adapted for light scattering by small particles to
model the spectral properties of these asteroids. Results. Our best-matching
models indicate that most objects in our sample possess a surface composition
that is consistent with the composition of CP IDPs.We find ultra-fine grained
Fe-bearing olivine glasses to be among the dominant constituents. We further
detect the presence of minor fractions of Mg-rich crystalline silicates. The
few unsuccessfully matched asteroids may indicate the presence of interlopers
in the family or objects sampling a distinct compositional layer of the parent
body. Conclusions. The composition inferred for the Themis family members
suggests that the parent body accreted from a mixture of ice and anhydrous
silicates (mainly amorphous) and subsequently underwent limited heating. By
comparison with existing thermal models that assume a 400km diameter
progenitor, the accretion process of the Themis parent body must have occurred
relatively late (>4Myr after CAIs) so that only moderate internal heating
occurred in its interior, preventing aqueous alteration of the outer shell.

Height of CBPs in SDO/AIA 19.3 nm channel was found to be $\approx$6500 km.
Meridional motion is predominantly poleward for all latitudes, while solar
velocity residuals show signs of torsional oscillations. Horizontal Reynolds
stress was found to be small compared to similar works, but still showing
transfer of angular momentum towards the solar equator. Conclusion. Most of the
results are consistent with Doppler measurements rather than tracer
measurements. Fairly small calculated value of horizontal Reynolds stress might
be due to the particular phase of the solar cycle. Accuracy of the calculated
rotation profile indicates that it is possible to measure changes in the
profile as the solar cycle evolves. Analysis of further SDO/AIA CBP data will
also help in better understanding of the temporal behaviour of the rotation
velocity residuals, meridional motions and Reynolds stress.

180 J to D$_{2}$ or CD$_{4}$ molecular clusters. After removing the background
noise, we used the measured time-of-flight data of energetic deuterium ions to
obtain their energy distribution. We derive the S-factor using the measured
energy distribution of the ions, the measured volume of the fusion plasma and
the measured fusion yields. This method is model-independent in the sense that
no assumption on the state of the system is required, but it requires an
accurate measurement of the ion energy distribution especially at high energies
and of the relevant fusion yields. In the d(d,n)$^{3}$He and
$^{3}$He(d,p)$^{4}$He cases discussed here, it is very important to apply the
background subtraction for the energetic ions and to measure the fusion yields
with high precision. While the available data on both ion distribution and
fusion yields allow us to determine with good precision the S-factor in the d+d
case (lower Gamow energies), for the d+$^3$He case the data are not precise
enough to obtain the S-factor using this method. Our results agree with other
experiments within the experimental error, even though smaller values of the
S-factor were obtained. This might be due to the plasma environment differing
from the beam target conditions in a conventional accelerator experiment.

equivalent widths of star-forming and active galaxies from the Sloan Digital

show that emission line equivalent widths can be fairly well reconstructed from
the stellar continuum using local multiple linear regression in the continuum
principal component analysis (PCA) space. Line reconstruction is good for
star-forming galaxies and reasonable for galaxies with active nuclei. We
propose a practical method to combine stellar population synthesis models with
empirical modelling of emission lines. The technique will help generate more
accurate model spectra and mock catalogues of galaxies to fit observations of
the new surveys. More accurate modelling of emission lines is also expected to
improve template-based photometric redshift estimation methods. We also show
that, by combining PCA coefficients from the pure continuum and the emission
lines, automatic distinction between hosts of weak active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) and quiescent star-forming galaxies can be made. The classification
method is based on a training set consisting of high-confidence starburst
galaxies and AGNs, and allows for the similar separation of active and
star-forming galaxies as the empirical curve found by Kauffmann et al. We

major challenge for their effective use. In this paper, we present a novel
information theoretic analysis of the impact of insertion-deletion (indel)
errors in nanopore sequencers. In particular, we consider the following
problems: (i) for given indel error characteristics and rate, what is the
probability of accurate reconstruction as a function of sequence length; (ii)
what is the number of `typical' sequences within the distortion bound induced
by indel errors; (iii) using replicated extrusion (the process of passing a DNA
strand through the nanopore), what is the number of replicas needed to reduce
the distortion bound so that only one typical sequence exists within the
distortion bound.
  Our results provide a number of important insights: (i) the maximum length of
a sequence that can be accurately reconstructed in the presence of indel and
substitution errors is relatively small; (ii) the number of typical sequences
within the distortion bound is large; and (iii) replicated extrusion is an
effective technique for unique reconstruction. In particular, we show that the
number of replicas is a slow function (logarithmic) of sequence length --
implying that through replicated extrusion, we can sequence large reads using
nanopore sequencers. Our model considers indel and substitution errors
separately. In this sense, it can be viewed as providing (tight) bounds on
reconstruction lengths and repetitions for accurate reconstruction when the two
error modes are considered in a single model.

star-formation (SF) law in the local luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) IC4687.
This is one of the first studies of the SF law on a starburst LIRG at these
small spatial scales. We combined new interferometric ALMA CO(2-1) data with
existing HST/NICMOS Pa$\alpha$ narrow-band imaging and VLT/SINFONI near-IR
integral field spectroscopy to obtain accurate extinction corrected SF rate
(SFR) and cold molecular gas surface densities ($\Sigma_{gas}$ and
$\Sigma_{SFR}$). We find that IC4687 forms stars very efficiently with an
average depletion time ($t_{dep}$) of 160 Myr for the individual 250 pc
regions. This is approximately one order of magnitude shorter than the
$t_{dep}$ of local normal spirals and also shorter than that of main-sequence
high-z objects, even when we use a Galactic $\alpha_{CO}$ conversion factor.
This result suggests a bimodal SF law in the $\Sigma_{SFR} \propto
\Sigma_{gas}^{N}$ representation. A universal SF law is recovered if we
normalize the $\Sigma_{gas}$ by the global dynamical time. However, at the
spatial scales studied here, we find that the SF efficiency (or $t_{dep}$) does
not depend on the local dynamical time for this object. Therefore, an
alternative normalization (e.g., free-fall time) should be found if a universal
SF law exists at these scales.

  Particle Filtering",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Autonomous systems such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) need to be able to
recognise and track crowds of people, e.g. for rescuing and surveillance
purposes. Large groups generate multiple measurements with uncertain origin.
Additionally, often the sensor noise characteristics are unknown but
measurements are bounded within certain intervals. In this work we propose two
solutions to the crowds tracking problem - with a box particle filtering
approach and with a convolution particle filtering approach. The developed
filters can cope with the measurement origin uncertainty in an elegant way,
i.e. resolve the data association problem. For the box particle filter (PF) we
derive a theoretical expression of the generalised likelihood function in the
presence of clutter. An adaptive convolution particle filter (CPF) is also
developed and the performance of the two filters is compared with the standard
sequential importance resampling (SIR) PF. The pros and cons of the two filters
are illustrated over a realistic scenario (representing a crowd motion in a
stadium) for a large crowd of pedestrians. Accurate estimation results are
achieved.

results illustrate that the estimates are indeed of optimal order of

the process of finding consensus between the experts of the different systems

problem in multi-cell Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) downlink
(DL) systems. The target is to minimize the total transmit power consumption
when each user is served by an optimized subset of the base stations (BSs),
using non-coherent joint transmission. We first derive a lower bound on the
ergodic spectral efficiency (SE), which is applicable for any channel
distribution and precoding scheme. Closed-form expressions are obtained for
Rayleigh fading channels with either maximum ratio transmission (MRT) or zero
forcing (ZF) precoding. From these bounds, we further formulate the DL power
minimization problems with fixed SE constraints for the users. These problems
are proved to be solvable as linear programs, giving the optimal power
allocation and BS-user association with low complexity. Furthermore, we
formulate a max-min fairness problem which maximizes the worst SE among the
users, and we show that it can be solved as a quasi-linear program. Simulations
manifest that the proposed methods provide good SE for the users using less
transmit power than in small-scale systems and the optimal user association can
effectively balance the load between BSs when needed. Even though our framework
allows the joint transmission from multiple BSs, there is an overwhelming
probability that only one BS is associated with each user at the optimal
solution.

still be accurately described by an effective suspension viscosity. We thus
propose scaling laws for the mean velocity profile of the suspension flow,

gathered with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrograph (IGRINS) in the H and
K photometric bands, we have derived elemental abundances of two bright,
well-known metal-poor halo stars: the red giant HD 122563 and the subgiant HD
140283. Since these stars have metallicities approaching [Fe/H] = -3, their
absorption features are generally very weak. Neutral-species lines of Mg, Si, S
and Ca are detectable, as well as those of the light odd-Z elements Na and Al.
The derived IR-based abundances agree with those obtained from
optical-wavelength spectra. For Mg and Si the abundances from the infrared
transitions are improvements to those derived from shorter wavelength data.
Many useful OH and CO lines can be detected in the IGRINS HD 122563 spectrum,
from which derived O and C abundances are consistent to those obtained from the
traditional [O I] and CH features. IGRINS high resolutions H- and K-band
spectroscopy offers promising ways to determine more reliable abundances for
additional metal-poor stars whose optical features are either not detectable,
or too weak, or are based on lines with analytical difficulties.

its mass accurately because of the presence of neutrinos in the decay products

can be well determined by the momentum component of the $\tau$ decay products
perpendicular to the velocity of the $\tau$ lepton, $p_{\perp}$, and the mass
of the visible/invisible decay products, $m_{vis/inv}$, for $\tau$ decaying to
hadrons/leptons. By sampling all kinematically allowed values of $p_{\perp}$

by the MC simulations, the mass of the mother resonance is assumed to lie at
the position with the maximal probability. Since $p_{\perp}$ and $m_{vis/inv}$
are invariant under the boost in the $\tau$ lepton direction, the joint
probability distributions are independent upon $\tau$'s origin. Thus this
technique is able to determine the mass of an unknown resonance with no
efficiency loss. It is tested using the MC simulations of the physics processes
$ pp \to Z/h(125)/h(750)+X\to \tau\tau+X$ at 13~TeV. The ratio of the full

presented. Two degenerate metrics on the $4+d$-dimensional total manifold are
used, one corresponding to the spacetime metric and giving the fiber of the
gauge bundle, and the other one to the metric of the fiber and giving the
horizontal bundle of the connection. When combined, the two metrics give the
Kaluza metric and its generalization to the non-abelian case, justifying thus
his choice. Considering the two metrics as fundamental rather than the Kaluza
metric explains why Kaluza's theory should not be regarded as five-dimensional
vacuum gravity. This approach suggests that the only evidence of extra
dimensions is given by the existence of the gauge forces, explaining thus why
other kinds of evidence are not available. In addition, because the degenerate
metric corresponding to the spacetime metric vanishes along the extra
dimensions, the lengths in the extra dimensions is zero, preventing us to
directly probe them. Therefore this approach suggests that it is not justified
to search for experimental evidence of the extra dimensions as if they are
merely extra spacetime dimensions. On the other hand the new approach uses a
very general formalism, which can be applied to known and new generalizations
of the Kaluza theory aiming to achieve more and make different experimental
predictions.

downlink of a fog radio access network (F-RAN). In an F-RAN, as in cloud-RAN
(C-RAN), a baseband processing unit (BBU) can perform joint baseband processing
on behalf of the remote radio heads (RRHs) that are connected to the BBU by
means of the fronthaul links. In addition to the minimal functionalities of
conventional RRHs in C-RAN, the RRHs in an F-RAN may be equipped with local
caches, in which frequently requested contents can be stored, as well as with
baseband processing capabilities. They are hence referred to as enhanced RRH
(eRRH). This work focuses on the design of the delivery phase for an arbitrary
pre-fetching strategy used to populate the caches of the eRRHs. Two
fronthauling modes are considered, namely a hard-transfer mode, whereby
non-cached files are communicated over the fronthaul links to a subset of
eRRHs, and a soft-transfer mode, whereby the fronthaul links are used to convey
quantized baseband signals as in a C-RAN. Unlike the hard-transfer mode in
which baseband processing is traditionally carried out only at the eRRHs, the
soft-transfer mode enables both centralized precoding at the BBU and local
precoding at the eRRHs based on the cached contents, by means of a novel
superposition coding approach. To attain the advantages of both approaches, a
hybrid design of soft- and hard-transfer modes is also proposed. The problem of
maximizing the delivery rate is tackled under fronthaul capacity and per-eRRH
power constraints. Numerical results are provided to compare the performance of
hard- and soft-transfer fronthauling modes, as well as of the hybrid scheme,
for different baseline pre-fetching strategies.

  We tested our index in attack strategies where the nodes are disconnected in
decreasing order of a specified metric. We considered using the Hayastan
Shakarian cut (disconnecting the edge with max HS) and other well-known
strategies as the higher betweenness centrality disconnection. All strategies
were compared regarding the behavior of the robustness (R-index) during the

demonstrates electron turnstile operation. Compared to the more conventional
superconductor - normal metal - superconductor turnstile, our SQS device
presents a number of novel properties, including higher immunity to the
unavoidable presence of non-equilibrium quasiparticles in superconducting

its implications for magnetoelectric memory applications are discussed.
Cr$_2$O$_3$ is used in the estimates of the materials parameters. It is found
that the domain wall mobility has a maximum as a function of the electric field
due to the gyrotropic coupling induced by it. In Cr$_2$O$_3$ the maximal
mobility of 0.1 m/(s$\times$Oe) is reached at $E\approx0.06$ V/nm. Fields of
this order may be too weak to overcome the intrinsic depinning field, which is
estimated for B-doped Cr$_2$O$_3$. These major drawbacks for device
implementation can be overcome by applying a small in-plane shear strain, which
blocks the domain wall precession. Domain wall mobility of about 0.7
m/(s$\times$Oe) can then be achieved at $E=0.2$ V/nm. A split-gate scheme is
proposed for the domain-wall controlled bit element; its extension to
multiple-gate linear arrays can offer advantages in memory density,
programmability, and logic functionality.

semistable representations of the Jacobi algebra to the coarse moduli space of
polystable representations. This enables us to construct a degeneration of the
cohomological Hall algebra, for generic stability condition and fixed slope, to
a free supercommutative algebra generated by a mixed Hodge structure
categorifying the BPS invariants. As a corollary of this construction we
furthermore obtain a Lie algebra structure on this mixed Hodge structure - the

understanding the nature of the fluctuations and their coupling to fermions in
cuprates which lead to high temperature superconductivity and the invariably
associated strange metal state. Here we report the quantitative determination
of the normal and pairing self-energies, made possible by laser-based
angle-resolved photoemission measurements with unprecedented accuracy and
stability. Through a precise inversion procedure, both the effective
interactions in the attractive d-wave symmetry and the repulsive part in the
full symmetry are determined. The latter are nearly angle independent. Near Tc
both interactions are nearly independent of frequency, and have almost the same
magnitude, over the complete energy range of up to about 0.4 eV except for a
low energy feature around 50 meV present only in the repulsive part which has
less than 10% of the total spectral weight. Well below Tc, they both change
similarly by superconductivity induced features at low energies. Besides
finding the pairing self-energy and the attractive interactions for the first
time, these results expose a central paradox of the high Tc problem: how the

the supersymmetric standard model extended by U(1)_B-L symmetry (BLSSM). The
model requires two singlet Higgs fields, which are responsible for the
radiative breaking of U(1)_B-L symmetry. It predicts degenerate right-handed
neutrino masses (1.7-2.2 TeV) as well as the right-handed sneutrinos of mass <~
4 TeV. The presence of right-handed neutrinos and sneutrinos trigger the baryon
and lepton number violation processes, until they decouple from the Standard
model particles. Besides, the model predicts rather heavy colored particles;
stop and sbottom massesare >~ 1.5 TeV, while stau mass >~ 100 GeV and chargino
mass >~ 600 GeV. Even though, the implications are similar to minimal
supersymmetric standard model, BLSSM can predict another Higgs boson lighter
than 150 GeV. We find that the second Higgs boson can be degenerate with the
lightest CP-even Higgs boson of mass about 125 GeV and contribute to the Higgs
decay into two photons. In addition, it can provide an explanation for the
excess in h -> 4l at the mass scale ~ 145 GeV.

propose a method to enforce the segmentation contiguity, by introducing, in the
objective function, a penalty term inspired from the Normal Distribution
Function. We combine the two propositions into a novel time-driven constrained
clustering algorithm, called TDCK-Means, which creates a partition of coherent
clusters, both in the multidimensional space and in the temporal space. This
algorithm uses soft semi-supervised constraints, to encourage adjacent
observations belonging to the same entity to be assigned to the same cluster.
We apply our algorithm to a Political Studies dataset in order to detect
typical evolution phases. We adapt the Shannon entropy in order to measure the
entity contiguity, and we show that our proposition consistently improves
temporal cohesion of clusters, without any significant loss in the
multidimensional variance.

chemical reactions occurring in a dilute and well-mixed volume. The
reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) is a stochastic description of
reaction-diffusion processes on a spatial lattice, assuming well-mixing only on
the length scale of the lattice. It is clear that, for the sake of consistency,
the solution of the RDME of a chemical system should converge to the solution
of the CME of the same system in the limit of fast diffusion: indeed, this has
been tacitly assumed in most literature concerning the RDME. We show that, in
the limit of fast diffusion, the RDME indeed converges to a master equation,
but not necessarily the CME. We introduce a class of propensity functions, such
that if the RDME has propensities exclusively of this class then the RDME
converges to the CME of the same system; while if the RDME has propensities not
in this class then convergence is not guaranteed. These are revealed to be
elementary and non-elementary propensities respectively. We also show that
independent of the type of propensity, the RDME converges to the CME in the
simultaneous limit of fast diffusion and large volumes. We illustrate our
results with some simple example systems, and argue that the RDME cannot be an
accurate description of systems with non-elementary rates.

zeros of the zeta function have a real part equal to 1/2. We inspect in detail
the integral form of the (symmetrized) completed zeta function, which is a
product between the zeta and gamma functions. It is known that two integral
lines, expressing the completed zeta function, rotated from the real axis in
the opposite directions, can be shifted without affecting the completed zeta
function owing to the residue theorem. The completed zeta function is regular
in the region of the complex plane under consideration. For convenience in the
subsequent singularity analysis of the above integral, we first deform and
shift the integral contours. We then investigate the singularities of the
composite elements (caused by polynomial integrals in opposite directions),
which appear only in the case for which the distance between the contours and
the origin of the coordinates approaches zero. The real part of the zeros of
the zeta function is determined to be 1/2 along a symmetry line from the
singularity removal condition. (In the other points, the singularities are
adequately cancelled as a whole to lead to a finite value.)

electron's path on its way from a cylindrical cathode moving toward a co-axial
cylindrical anode in presence of a uniform magnetic field parallel to the
common axis. After analyzing the situation without coupling to an external
oscillatory electric field, we employ methods of canonical perturbation theory
to find the resonance condition between the frequencies of the free theory w_r,
w_phi and the applied perturbing oscillatory frequency w. A long-time averaging
process will then eliminate the periodic terms in the equation for the now
time-dependent action-angle variables. The terms that are no longer periodic
will cause secular changes so that the canonical action-angle variables (J,
delta) change in a way that the path of the electron will deform gradually so
that it can reach the anode. How the ensemble of the initially randomly
distributed electrons forms spokes and how their energy is conveyed to the
cavity-field oscillation is the main focus of this article. Some remarks
