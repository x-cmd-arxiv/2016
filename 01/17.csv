cosmological models with fluids obeying a Shan-Chen-like equation of state are
studied. The latter is of the type $p=w_{\rm eff}(\rho)\,\rho$, and has been
used in previous works to describe, e.g., a possible scenario for the growth of
the dark-energy content of the present Universe. At the classical level the
fluid dynamics in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background
implies the existence of two possible equilibrium solutions depending on the
model parameters, associated with (asymptotic) finite pressure and energy
density. We show that no future cosmological singularity is developed during
the evolution for this specific model. The corresponding quantum effects in the
late-time behavior of the system are also investigated within the framework of
quantum geometrodynamics, i.e., by solving the (minisuperspace) Wheeler-DeWitt
equation in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, constructing wave-packets and
analyzing their behavior.

manifest subset of the nodes can be directly actuated and measured while the

to identify the transfer function of the manifest subnetwork and determine
whether interactions between manifest nodes are direct or mediated by latent
nodes. We show that, if there are no inputs to the latent nodes, the manifest
transfer function can be approximated arbitrarily well in the H-infinity norm
sense by the transfer function of an auto-regressive model and present a
least-squares estimation method to construct the auto-regressive model from

an arbitrarily small H-infinity norm error in the approximation of the manifest

certain threshold. Finally, we show that when the latent subnetwork is acyclic,
the proposed method achieves perfect identification of the manifest transfer

denaturant-dependent folding of proteins order to make direct comparisons with
{\it in vitro} experiments. We use the molecular transfer model, which is
currently the only method that accomplishes this goal albeit
phenomenologically, to quantitatively describe urea-dependent folding of PDZ
domain, which plays a significant role in molecular recognition and signaling.
Experiments show that urea-dependent unfolding rates of the PDZ2 domain exhibit
a downward curvature at high urea concentrations, which has been interpreted by
invoking the presence of a sparsely populated high energy intermediate.
Simulations using the MTM and a coarse-grained model of PDZ2 are used to show
that the intermediate, which has some native-like character, is present in
equilibrium both in the presence and absence of urea. The free energy profiles
show that there are two barriers separating the folded and unfolded states.
Structures of the transition state ensembles, ($TSE1$ separating the unfolded
and $I_{EQ}$ and $TSE2$ separating $I_{EQ}$ and the native state), determined
using the $P_{fold}$ method, show that $TSE1$ is expanded; $TSE2$ and
native-like. Folding trajectories reveal that PDZ2 folds by parallel routes. In
one pathway folding occurs exclusively through $I_1$, which resembles $I_{EQ}$.
In a fraction of trajectories, constituting the second pathway, folding occurs
through a combination of $I_{1}$ and a kinetic intermediate. The radius of
gyration ($R_g^{U}$) of the unfolded state is more compact (by $\sim$ 9\%)
under native conditions. Decrease in $R_g^{U}$ occurs on the time scale on the
order of utmost $\sim$ 20 $\mu s$. The modest decrease in $R_g^{U}$ and the
rapid collapse suggest that high spatial and temporal resolution are needed to
detect compaction in finite-sized proteins.

into a high-dimensional semantic space and processed through a fully-connected

  The magnetostatic energy is described by a six-fold integral that is singular

wider use is still hindered by the lack of algorithms that can harness the
strengths of such architectures. While neuromorphic adaptations of
representation learning algorithms are now emerging, efficient processing of
temporal sequences or variable length-inputs remain difficult. Recurrent neural
networks (RNN) are widely used in machine learning to solve a variety of
sequence learning tasks. In this work we present a train-and-constrain
methodology that enables the mapping of machine learned (Elman) RNNs on a
substrate of spiking neurons, while being compatible with the capabilities of
current and near-future neuromorphic systems. This ""train-and-constrain"" method
consists of first training RNNs using backpropagation through time, then
discretizing the weights and finally converting them to spiking RNNs by
matching the responses of artificial neurons with those of the spiking neurons.
We demonstrate our approach by mapping a natural language processing task
(question classification), where we demonstrate the entire mapping process of
the recurrent layer of the network on IBM's Neurosynaptic System ""TrueNorth"", a
spike-based digital neuromorphic hardware architecture. TrueNorth imposes
specific constraints on connectivity, neural and synaptic parameters. To
satisfy these constraints, it was necessary to discretize the synaptic weights
and neural activities to 16 levels, and to limit fan-in to 64 inputs. We find
that short synaptic delays are sufficient to implement the dynamical (temporal)
aspect of the RNN in the question classification task. The hardware-constrained
model achieved 74% accuracy in question classification while using less than
0.025% of the cores on one TrueNorth chip, resulting in an estimated power

particular, classical Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), Generalized Hurst
Exponent (GHE) and GM2 (one of Geometric Method-based algorithms) were applied
for self-similarity exponent calculation purposes. Traditionally, researchers
have been focused on identifying the beginning of a crash. Instead of this, we
are pretty interested in identifying the beginning of the transition process
from EM to a market bubble onset, what we consider could be more interesting.
The relevance of self-similarity index in such a context lies on the fact that
it becomes a suitable indicator which allows to identify the raising of HB in
financial markets. Overall, we could state that the greater the self-similarity
exponent in financial series, the more likely the transition process to HB
could start. This fact is illustrated through actual S\&P500 stocks.

exponential statistical manifold point of view, which allows for a deeper
geometric understanding of the manifold structures at play. We also show that
the projection in the exponential manifold structure is consistent with the
Fisher Rao metric and, in case of finite dimensional exponential families, with
the assumed density approximation. Further, we show that if the sufficient
statistics of the finite dimensional exponential family are chosen among the
eigenfunctions of the backward diffusion operator then the statistical-manifold

Successful implementation of this strategy requires a broadband absorber where
carriers interact among themselves more strongly than with phonons, as well as
energy-selective contacts to extract the excess electronic heat. Here we show
that graphene-WSe2-graphene heterostructure devices offer this possibility
through the photo-thermionic effect: the absorbed photon energy in graphene is
efficiently transferred to the electron bath, leading to a thermalized hot
carrier distribution. Carriers with energy higher than the Schottky barrier
between graphene and WSe2 can be emitted over the barrier, thus creating
photocurrent. We experimentally demonstrate that the photo-thermionic effect
enables detection of sub-bandgap photons, while being size-scalable,
electrically tunable, broadband and ultrafast.

biophysical processes. Although its behavior seems deceivingly simple, recent
studies showing passive superdiffusive transport suggest diffusion on surfaces
may hide rich complexities. In particular, bulk-mediated diffusion occurs when
molecules are transiently released from the surface to perform
three-dimensional excursions into the liquid bulk. This phenomenon bears the
dichotomy where a molecule always return to the surface but the mean jump
length is infinite. Such behavior is associated with a breakdown of the central
limit theorem and weak ergodicity breaking. Here, we use single-particle
tracking to study the statistics of bulk-mediated diffusion on a supported
lipid bilayer. We find that the time-averaged mean square displacement (MSD) of
individual trajectories, the archetypal measure in diffusion processes, does
not converge to the ensemble MSD but it remains a random variable, even in the
long observation-time limit. The distribution of time averages is shown to
agree with a L\'{e}vy flight model. Our results also unravel intriguing
anomalies in the statistics of displacements. The time averaged MSD is shown to
depend on experimental time and investigations of fractional moments show a
scaling $\langle |r(t)|^q\rangle \sim t^{q\nu(q)}$ with non-linear exponents,
i.e. $\nu(q)\neq\textrm{const}$. This type of behavior is termed strong
anomalous diffusion and is rare among experimental observations.

by minimizing data residual error in fourier space domain and variable total
variation (TV) regularizing term which can protect the edges as TV regularizing
term and reduce staircasing effect. The well-posedness of this optimization
problem is studied under a very general setting. Actually, we write the
time-space fractional diffusion equation as an abstract fractional differential
equation and get our results by using fractional semigroup theory, so our
results can be applied to other backward problems for more general fractional
differential equations. Then a modified Bregman iterative algorithm is proposed
to approximate the minimizer. The new features of this algorithm is that the
regularizing term changed in each step and we need not to solve the complexed
Euler-Lagrange equations of variable TV regularizing term (just need to solve a
simpler Euler-Lagrange equations). The convergence of this algorithm and the
strategy of choosing parameters are also obtained. Numerical implementations

structured and succinctly representable. We formalize this problem and present
a general two-staged approach for producing satisfying payout structures given

carefully designed heuristic scales very well, even to contests with over
100,000 prize winners.

It is similarly shown that the average is $O \left( \frac{k^w m}{w} \right)$ in

the amplitude and the phase of light in its own inertial frame will also
(perfectly) cloak this light in any other inertial frame. The same conclusion
lends itself to invisible objects that are not cloaks, such as the invisible

slope of SFR-M* relation, the so-called ""Main Sequence"" of star-forming
galaxies, and discuss its implication on the physical processes that shaped the
star formation history of massive galaxies over cosmic time. We use the CANDELS
near-IR imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope to perform the bulge-to-disk
decomposition of distant galaxies and measure for the first time the slope of
the SFR-Mdisk relation at z=1. We find that this relation follows very closely
the shape of the SFR-M* correlation, still with a pronounced flattening at the
high-mass end. This is clearly excluding, at least at z=1, the secular growth
of quiescent bulges in star-forming galaxies as the main driver for the change
of slope of the Main Sequence. Then, by stacking the Herschel data available in
the CANDELS field, we estimate the total gas mass and the star formation
efficiency at different positions on the SFR-M* relation. We find that the
relatively low SFRs observed in massive galaxies (M* > 5e10 Msun) are caused by
a decreased star formation efficiency, by up to a factor of 3 as compared to
lower stellar mass galaxies, and not by a reduced gas content. The trend at the
lowest masses is likely linked to the dominance of atomic over molecular gas.
We argue that this stellar-mass-dependent SFE can explain the varying slope of
the Main Sequence since z=1.5, hence over 70% of the Hubble time. The drop of
SFE occurs at lower masses in the local Universe (M* > 2e10 Msun) and is not
present at z=2. Altogether this provides evidence for a slow downfall of the
star formation efficiency in massive Main Sequence galaxies. The resulting loss
of star formation is found to be rising starting from z=2 to reach a level
comparable to the mass growth of the quiescent population by z=1. We finally
discuss the possible physical origin of this phenomenon.

""frozen"" (no fine-tuning of any free parameters or internal algorithms of the

Furthermore, we find that in both models, large numbers of stellar-mass black
holes (> 1000) are retained for 12 Gyr. Thus, the very accurate direct $N$-body
approach confirms recent predictions that black holes can be retained in
present-day, old globular clusters. We find only minor disagreements between
the two models and attribute these to the small-$N$ dynamics driving the
evolution of the cluster core for which the Monte Carlo assumptions are less
ideal. Based on the overwhelming general agreement between the two models
computed using these vastly different techniques, we conclude that our Monte
Carlo approach, which is more approximate, but dramatically faster compared to
the direct $N$-body, is capable of producing a very accurate description of the
long-term evolution of massive globular clusters even when the clusters contain
large populations of stellar-mass black holes.

the background of the user application. Its objectives include (1) gathering

this information to orchestrate error recovery, requesting recovery and
reconfiguration actions to those tools related to error isolation and recovery.
Clearly a key point in this approach is guaranteeing that the backbone itself
tolerates internal and external faults. In this article we describe one of the

two cases: a free particle and a harmonic oscillator. The real line is divided
into intervals of the same length, and coarse-grained histories are defined by
the time average of the position of the particle on a given Feynman path to be
within one of these intervals. The position of the pointer in each Feynman path
correlates with this time average. The class operators for this system have
been evaluated, and the decoherence functional shows that these coarse-grained

misconstrued as magnetars; however, several observational features allow us to
distinguish a quark star (left behind by a quark-nova) from a neutron star with
high magnetic field. In our model, bursting activity is expected from
intermittent accretion events from the surrounding fall-back debris leading to
X-ray bursts (in the case of a Keplerian ring) or gamma ray bursts (in the case
of a co-rotating shell). The details of the spectra are described by a constant
background X-ray luminosity from the expulsion of magnetic flux tubes which
will be temporarily buried by bursting events caused by accretion of material
onto the quark star surface. These accretion events emit high energy photons
and heat up the quark star and surrounding debris leading to hot spots which
may be observable as distinct blackbodies. Additionally, we explain observed
spectral line features as atomic lines from r-process material and explain an
observed anti-glitch in an AXP as the transfer of angular momentum from a
surrounding Keplerian disk to the quark star.

insulating bulk resistance with de- creasing temperature, resulting in
resistivity plateau at low temperatures as a transport signature originating
from metallic surface modes protected by time reversal symmetry (TRS). Such
characteristic has been found in several materials including Bi2Te2Se, SmB6
etc. Recently, similar behavior has been observed in metallic com- pound LaSb,
accompanying an extremely large magetoresistance (XMR). Shubnikov-de Hass (SdH)
oscillation at low temperatures further confirms the metallic behavior of
plateau region under magnetic fields. LaSb[1] has been proposed by the authors
as a possible topological semimetal (TSM), while negative magnetoresistance is
absent at this moment. Here, high quality single crystals of NbAs2/TaAs2 with
inversion symmetry have been grown and the resistivity under magnetic field is
systematically investigated. Both of them exhibit metallic behavior under zero
magnetic field, and a metal-to-insulator transition occurs when a nonzero
magnetic field is applied, resulting in XMR (1.0*105% for NbAs2 and 7.3*105%
for TaAs2 at 2.5 K & 14 T). With tempera- ture decreased, a resistivity plateau
emerges after the insulator-like regime and SdH oscillation has also been

collisions at 400MeV/nucleon within a transport model. It is shown that the
sensitivity of \rpi ratio on symmetry energy shows a transition from central to
peripheral collisions, i.e., the stiffer symmetry energy leads to a larger \rpi
ratio in peripheral collisions while the softer symmetry energy always leads
this ratio to be larger in central collisions. After checking the kinematic
energy distribution of \rpi ratio, we found this transition of sensitivity of
\rpi ratio to symmetry energy is mainly from less energetic pions, i.e., the
softer symmetry energy gets the less energetic pions to form a smaller \rpi
ratio in peripheral collisions while these pions generate a larger \rpi ratio
in central collisions. Undoubtedly, the softer symmetry energy can also lead
more energetic pions to form a larger \rpi ratio in peripheral collisions.
Nevertheless, considering that most of pions are insufficient energetic at this
beam energy, we therefore suggest the \rpi ratio as a probe of the high-density
symmetry energy effective only in central at most to midcentral collisions,
thereby avoiding the possible information of low-density symmetry energy
carried in \rpi ratio from peripheral collisions.

communications as it can power wireless networks with renewable energy sources.
However, directly replacing the conventional non-EH transmitters by EH nodes
will be a challenge. In this paper, we propose to deploy extra EH nodes as
relays over an existing non-EH network. Specifically, the considered non-EH
network consists of multiple source-destination (S-D) pairs. The deployed EH
relays will take turns to assist each S-D pair, and energy diversity can be
achieved to combat the low EH rate of each EH relay. To make the best of these
EH relays, with the source transmit power minimization as the design objective,
we formulate a joint power assignment and relay selection problem, which,
however, is NP-hard. We thus propose a general framework to develop efficient
sub-optimal algorithms, which is mainly based on a sufficient condition for the
feasibility of the optimization problem. This condition yields useful design
insights and also reveals an energy hardening effect, which provides the
possibility to exempt the requirement of non-causal EH information. Simulation
results will show that the proposed cooperation strategy can achieve
near-optimal performance and provide significant power savings. Compared to the
greedy cooperation method that only optimizes the performance of the current
transmission block, the proposed strategy can achieve the same performance with
much fewer relays, and the performance gap increases with the number of S-D
pairs.

capacity to encode spatial maps, which is consistent with the experimental
observations.

and unknown cyber attacks by checking that the run-time behavior of the
application is consistent with the expected behavior modeled in application
specification. This is crucial because, even if the implementation is
consistent with its specification, the application may still be vulnerable due
to flaws in the supporting infrastructure (e.g. the language runtime system,
libraries and operating system). This runtime security monitor is sound and
complete, eliminating false alarms, as well as efficient, so that it does not
limit runtime application performance and so that it supports real-time
systems. The security monitor takes as input the application specification and
the application implementation, which may be expressed in different languages.
The specification language of the application software is formalized based on
monadic second order logic and event calculus interpreted over algebraic data
structures. This language allows us to express behavior of an application at
any desired (and practical) level of abstraction as well as with high degree of
modularity. The security monitor detects every attack by systematically
comparing the application execution and specification behaviors at runtime,

chooses production and pricing strategies of a single good. Firm's goal is to
maximize the discounted profit over infinite time horizon. The no-backlogging
assumption induces the state constraint on the inventory level. The revenue and
production cost functions are assumed to be continuous but, in general, we do
not impose the concavity/convexity property. Using the results form the theory
of viscosity solutions and Young-Fenchel duality, we derive a representation
for the value function, study its regularity properties, and give a complete
description of optimal strategies for this non-convex optimal control problem.
In agreement with the results of Chazal et al. (2003), it is optimal to
liquidate initial inventory in finite time and then use an optimal static
strategy. We give a condition, allowing to distinguish if this static strategy
can be represented by an ordinary or relaxed control. The latter is related to
production cycles. General theory is illustrate by the example of a non-convex
production cost, proposed by Arvan and Moses (1981).

$(X(1)-X((1-t)-))_{t\in[0,1]}$, where $X$ is either a Brownian motion, a

The small values probabilities for the stick-breaking factor determine which of

relies upon two novel ingredients and particularly enables us to dispense with

generates asymptotic series. Despite non-convergence, the asymptotic expansions
are useful when truncated to a finite number of terms. This is the reason for
popularity of leading-order methods such as $GW$ approximation in condensed
matter, molecular and atomic physics. Emerging higher-order implementations
suffer from the appearance of nonsimple poles in the frequency-dependent
Green's functions and negative spectral densities making self-consistent
determination of the electronic structure impossible. Here a method based on
the Pad\'e approximation for overcomming these difficulties is proposed and
applied to the Hamiltonian describing a core electron coupled to a single
plasmonic excitation. By solving the model purely diagrammatically, expressing
the self-energy in terms of combinatorics of chord diagrams, and regularizing
the diverging perturbative expansions using the Pad\'e approximation the
spectral function is determined self-consistently using 3111 diagrams up to the

topological groups which do not necessarily have Property (T). We provide a new
criterion for a generating subset $Q$ of a group $G$ to be a Kazhdan set; it
relies on the existence of a positive number $\varepsilon$ such that every
unitary representation of $G$ with a $(Q,\varepsilon )$-invariant vector has a
finite dimensional subrepresentation. Using this result, we give an
equidistribution criterion for a generating subset of $G$ to be a Kazhdan set.
In the case where $G=\mathbb{Z}$, this shows that if $(n_{k})_{k\ge 1}$ is a
sequence of integers such that $(e^{2i\pi \theta n_{k}})_{k\ge 1}$ is uniformly
distributed in the unit circle for all real numbers $\theta $ except at most
countably many, then $\{n_{k}\,;\,k\ge 1\}$ is a Kazhdan set in $\mathbb{Z}$ as
soon as it generates $\mathbb{Z}$. This answers a question of Y. Shalom from

applicable to all pixels on ocean, by designing a set of neural networks with
different inputs. The present study focuses on the choice of the learning
database and demonstrates that a judicious distribution of the geophysical
parameters allows to markedly reduce the systematic regional biases of the
retrieved SSS, which are due to the high noise on the TBs. An equalization of
the distribution of the geophysical parameters, followed by a new technique for
boosting the learning process, makes the regional biases almost disappear for
latitudes between 40{\deg}S and 40{\deg}N, while the global standard deviation
remains between 0.6 psu (at the center of the of the swath) and 1 psu (at the

respect to the maximization of the expected points scored. We reject this
hypothesis by analyzing the decisions made in the past 7 NFL seasons for two
particular plays; (i) the Point(s) After Touchdown (PAT) and (ii) the fourth
down decisions. Having rejected the rational coaching hypothesis we move on to
examine how the detailed game data collected can potentially inform game-day
decisions. While NFL teams personnel definitely have an intuition on which
factors are crucial for winning a game, in this work we take a data-driven
approach and provide quantifiable evidence using a large dataset of NFL games
for the 7-year period between 2009 and 2015. In particular, we use a logistic
regression model to identify the impact and the corresponding statistical
significance of factors such as possession time, number of penalty yards,
balance between passing and rushing offense etc. Our results clearly imply that
avoiding turnovers is the best strategy for winning a game but turnovers can be
overcome with letting the offense on the field for more time. Finally we
combine our descriptive model with statistical bootstrap in order to provide a
prediction engine for upcoming NFL games. Our evaluations indicate that even by
only considering a small number of (straightforward) factors, we can achieve a
very good prediction accuracy. In particular, the average accuracy during
seasons 2014 and 2015 is approximately 63%. This performance is comparable to
the more complicated state-of-the-art prediction systems, while it outperforms

(PD). As the proposed method does not involve any motion-stages or other moving
components, the focal length is measured without requiring any mechanical
motion of bulk components. The method requires measuring the spot size of the
Gaussian Beam at the DMD plane for various settings of the ECVFL focal length.
These beam spot size measurements, are used to estimate the focal length of a
lens sample by employing standard polynomial-fitting techniques. Due to the
inherent motion-free nature of the proposed setup, the measurements are fast,
repeatable, reliable and ideal for use in industrial lens production,
manufacturing of imaging systems and sensitive laboratory experiments. Using a
DMD and an ECVFL also allows for automating the lens characterization process.
As a proof-of-concept, experiments were performed to determine focal length
values of multiple lens samples with the proposed technique. The values of
focal lengths of all samples are in agreement with the focal length values
which were provided by the manufacturer of these test lenses. The estimated
focal length values are within the 1% manufacturing tolerance values that were
provided.

short review of tensor Lagrangians, which generate massless free fields and the
Dirac field, as well as vector and pseudovector Lagrangians for the electric
and magnetic fields of Maxwell's equations with sources. We introduce and
analyse Lagrangians which are equivalent to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and
recast them to relativistic equations.

presented. The angular momentum basis for particles of zero mass and finite
spin s of the D^(s-1/2,1/2) representation of the Lorentz group is used to
describe the wavefunctions. The advantage of the formalism is that by equating
to zero the s-1 components of the wave functions, the 2s-1 subsidiary
conditions (needed to eliminate the non-forward and non-backward helicities)
are automatically satisfied. Probability currents and Lagrangians are derived
allowing a first quantized formalism. A simple procedure is derived for
connecting the wave functions with potentials and gauge conditions. The spin 1
case is of particular interest and is described with the D^(1/2,1/2) vector
representation of the well known self-dual representation of the Maxwell's
equations. This representation allows us to generalize Maxwell's equations by
adding the E_0 and B_0 components to the electric and magnetic four-vectors.
Restrictions on their existence are discussed.
