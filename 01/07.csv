  In this paper, we carry out the first extensive formal analysis of the OAuth

strong authorization, authentication, and session integrity guarantees, for

run simultaneously in the same and different relying parties and identity
providers, where malicious relying parties, identity providers, and browsers
are considered as well. Our modeling and analysis of the OAuth 2.0 standard
assumes that security recommendations and best practices are followed, in order
to avoid obvious and known attacks.
  When proving the security of OAuth in our model, we discovered four attacks
which break the security of OAuth. The vulnerabilities can be exploited in
practice and are present also in OpenID Connect.
  We propose fixes for the identified vulnerabilities, and then, for the first
time, actually prove the security of OAuth in an expressive web model. In
particular, we show that the fixed version of OAuth (with security
recommendations and best practices in place) provides the authorization,

machines can simulate each other within a polynomially overhead in time. Is
lambda-calculus a reasonable machine? Is there a way to measure the
computational complexity of a lambda-term? This paper presents the first
complete positive answer to this long-standing problem. Moreover, our answer is
completely machine-independent and based over a standard notion in the theory
of lambda-calculus: the length of a leftmost-outermost derivation to normal
form is an invariant cost model. Such a theorem cannot be proved by directly
relating lambda-calculus with Turing machines or random access machines,
because of the size explosion problem: there are terms that in a linear number
of steps produce an exponentially long output. The first step towards the
solution is to shift to a notion of evaluation for which the length and the
size of the output are linearly related. This is done by adopting the linear
substitution calculus (LSC), a calculus of explicit substitutions modeled after
linear logic proof nets and admitting a decomposition of leftmost-outermost
derivations with the desired property. Thus, the LSC is invariant with respect
to, say, random access machines. The second step is to show that LSC is
invariant with respect to the lambda-calculus. The size explosion problem seems
to imply that this is not possible: having the same notions of normal form,
evaluation in the LSC is exponentially longer than in the lambda-calculus. We
solve such an impasse by introducing a new form of shared normal form and
shared reduction, deemed useful. Useful evaluation avoids those steps that only
unshare the output without contributing to beta-redexes, i.e. the steps that
cause the blow-up in size. The main technical contribution of the paper is
indeed the definition of useful reductions and the thorough analysis of their
properties.

implement as it simplifies the routing tables and packet flow paths. However it
is not optimal and has shortcomings in utilizing the network resources
optimally, load balancing & fast recovery in case of faults (fault tolerance).
The given algorithm resolves all these problems by using all possible multiple
paths for transfer of information, while retaining loop-free property. We have
proposed a new dynamic loop-free multipath routing algorithm which improves
network throughput and network resource utilization, reduces average
transmission delay, and is not affected by faults in the links and router
nodes. The main idea of this algorithm is to maintain multiple possible next
hops for a destination along with weights. At every node, the traffic to a
destination is split among multiple next hops in proportion to the estimated
weights. The number of multiple next hops also changes depending on the traffic
conditions, but it is never less than one.

Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. We utilise a variety of physical galaxy
properties for training the pattern recognition algorithm to recognise star
forming and passive systems, for a `training set' of $\sim$100,000 galaxies. We
then apply the ANN model to a `verification set' of $\sim$100,000 different
galaxies, randomly chosen from the remaining sample. The success rate of each
parameter singly, and in conjunction with other parameters, is taken as an
indication of how important the parameters are to the process(es) of central
galaxy quenching. We find that central velocity dispersion, bulge mass and B/T
are excellent predictors of the passive state of the system, indicating that
properties related to the central mass of the galaxy are most closely linked to
the cessation of star formation. Larger scale galaxy properties (total or disk
stellar masses), or those linked to environment (halo masses or $\delta_5$)
perform significantly less well. Our results are plausibly explained by AGN

considered. One common and two private messages are transmitted and the private
message to the cooperative user should be kept secret from the
cooperation-aided user. The secrecy level is measured in terms of strong
secrecy, i.e., a vanishing information leakage. An inner bound on the capacity
region is derived by using a channel-resolvability-based code that double-bins
the codebook of the secret message, and by using a likelihood encoder to choose
the transmitted codeword. The inner bound is shown to be tight for
semi-deterministic and physically degraded BCs and the results are compared to
those of the corresponding BCs without a secrecy constraint. Blackwell and
Gaussian BC examples illustrate the impact of secrecy on the rate regions.
Unlike the case without secrecy, where sharing information about both private

Cauchy problem for two classes of quasilinear wave equations in two spatial

data have one-dimensional symmetry, Lax's methods can be applied to the wave
equations to show that a large set of smooth initial data lead to wave
breaking. Here we study solutions with initial data that are close, as measured
by an appropriate Sobolev norm, to data belonging to a distinguished subset of
Lax's data: the data corresponding to simple plane waves. Our main result is
that under suitable relative smallness assumptions, the Lax-type wave breaking
for simple plane waves is stable. The key point is that we allow the data
perturbations to break the symmetry. Moreover, we give a detailed, constructive

polarimetric results with those of the surrounding sources within the 7'x7'

synchrotron emission, or both. We also present the broadband spectra of V404
Cyg during the orphan NIR flare and a relatively faint and steady state by
including quasi-simultaneous Swift/XRT and INTEGRAL fluxes. By adopting a
single-zone synchrotron plus inverse-Compton model as widely used in modeling
of blazars, we constrained the parameters of a putative jet. Because the jet
synchrotron component cannot exceed the Swift/XRT disk/corona flux, the cutoff
Lorentz factor in the electron energy distribution is constrained to be <10^2,
suggesting particle acceleration is less efficient in this microquasar jet
outburst compared to AGN jets. We also suggest that the loading of the baryon
component inside the jet is inevitable based on energetic arguments.

examine this phenomenon because it is straightforward to determine membership

giants experience a brief phase of Li enrichment at the He core flash. (2) All
post-RGB stars with binary companions on the lower RGB will engage in mass
transfer. This scenario predicts that 0.1% of lower RGB stars will appear

artefact of line-of-sight projection effects in an edge-on disc. We search for
the presence of a correlation in Herschel and Spitzer observations of two

4038 and 4039. We show that not only is this empirical relationship also
observed in face-on galaxies, but also that the correlation appears to be
governed by the star formation rate (SFR). Both the nuclear starburst in M83
and the merger-induced star formation in NGC 4038/9 exhibit less [NII] emission
per unit SFR surface density than the normal star-forming discs. These regions
of intense star formation exhibit stronger ionization parameters, as traced by
the 70/160 {\mu}m far-infrared colour, that suggest the presence of higher
ionization lines that may become more important for gas cooling, thereby
reducing the observed [NII] 205 {\mu}m line emission in regions with higher
star formation rates. Finally, we present a general relation between the [NII]
205 {\mu}m line flux density and SFR density for normal star-forming galaxies,

at hadron colliders. These angularities are modified from the original
definitions in e+e- collisions to be boost invariant along the beam axis. These
shapes apply to the constituents of jets defined with respect to either
k_T-type (anti-k_T, C/A, and k_T) algorithms and cone-type algorithms. We
present an SCET factorization formula and calculate the ingredients needed to
achieve next-to-leading-log (NLL) accuracy in kinematic regions where
non-global logarithms are not large. The factorization formula involves
previously unstudied ""unmeasured beam functions,"" which are present for finite
rapidity cuts around the beams. We derive relations between the jet functions
and the shape-dependent part of the soft function that appear in the factorized
cross section and those previously calculated for e+e- collisions, and present
the calculation of the non-trivial, color-connected part of the soft-function
to O(\alpha_s). This latter part of the soft function is universal in the sense
that it applies to any experimental setup with an out-of-jet p_T veto and
rapidity cuts together with two tagged jets and it is independent of the choice
of jet (sub-)structure measurement. In addition, we implement the recently
introduced soft-collinear refactorization to resum logarithms of the jet size,
valid in the region of non-enhanced non-global logarithm effects. While our
results are valid for all 2 \to 2 channels, we compute explicitly for the qq'
\to qq' channel the color-flow matrices and plot the NLL resummed differential
dijet cross section as an explicit example, which shows that the normalization
and scale uncertainty is reduced when the soft function is refactorized. For
this channel, we also plot the jet size R dependence, the p_T^{\rm cut}
dependence, and the dependence on the angularity parameter a.

opaque and computationally arduous: analyses of TQFT condensation are
practically performed on a case by case basis and for very simple theories
only, mostly not using the Frobenius algebra formalism. In this paper we
provide a new way of treating boson condensation that is computationally
efficient. With a minimal set of physical assumptions, such as commutativity of
lifting and the definition of confined particles, we can prove a number of
theorems linking Boson condensation in TQFT with chiral algebra extensions, and
with the factorization of completely positive matrices over the nonnegative
integers. We present numerically efficient ways of obtaining a condensed theory
fusion algebra and S matrices; and we then use our formalism to prove several
theorems for the S and T matrices of simple current condensation and of
theories which upon condensation result in a low number of confined particles.
We also show that our formalism easily reproduces results existent in the
mathematical literature such as the noncondensability of 5 and 10 layers of the

testing our current standard cosmological model and revealing possibly new
physics. With Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, each strong gravitational
lens system with measured time delays can allow one to determine the Hubble
constant with an uncertainty of $\sim 7\%$. Since HST will not last forever, we
explore adaptive-optics (AO) imaging as an alternative that can provide higher
angular resolution than HST imaging but has a less stable point spread function
(PSF) due to atmospheric distortion. To make AO imaging useful for
time-delay-lens cosmography, we develop a method to extract the unknown PSF
directly from the imaging of strongly lensed quasars. In a blind test with two
mock data sets created with different PSFs, we are able to recover the
important cosmological parameters (time-delay distance, external shear, lens
mass profile slope, and total Einstein radius). Our analysis of the Keck AO
image of the strong lens system RXJ1131-1231 shows that the important
parameters for cosmography agree with those based on HST imaging and modeling
within 1-$\sigma$ uncertainties. Most importantly, the constraint on the model
time-delay distance by using AO imaging with $0.045""$resolution is tighter by
$\sim 50\%$ than the constraint of time-delay distance by using HST imaging
with $0.09""$when a power-law mass distribution for the lens system is adopted.
Our PSF reconstruction technique is generic and applicable to data sets that
have multiple nearby point sources, enabling scientific studies that require
high-precision models of the PSF.

a dynamical analysis of multiple tracer populations to constrain its mass over
a large radius range. We combine stellar kinematics in the central regions with
the dynamics of 612 globular clusters out to 200 kpc and satellite galaxies
extending to scales comparable with the virial radius. Using a spherical Jeans
analysis, we are able to disentangle the mass contributions from the dark and
baryonic components and set constraints on the structure of each. Assuming
isotropy, we explore four different models for the dark matter halo and find
that a centrally-cored dark matter distribution is preferred. We infer a
stellar mass-to-light ratio $\Upsilon_{\star,v} = 6.9 \pm 0.1$ -- consistent
with a Salpeter-like IMF -- and a core radius $r_c = 67 \pm 20$ kpc. We then
introduce anisotropy and find that, while the halo remains clearly cored, the
radial stellar anisotropy has a strong impact on both $\Upsilon_{\star,v}$ and
the core's radius; here we find $\Upsilon_{\star,v} = 3.50_{-0.36}^{+0.32}$ --
consistent with a Chabrier-like IMF -- and $r_c = 19.00_{-8.34}^{+8.38}$ kpc.
Thus the presence of a core at the centre of the dark halo is robust against
anisotropy assumptions, while the stellar mass and core size are not. We are
able to reconcile previously discrepant studies by showing that modelling the
globular cluster data alone leads to the very different inference of a
super-NFW cusp, thus highlighting the value of multiple-population modelling,
and we point to the possible role of M87's AGN and the cluster environment in
forming the central dark matter core.

$l^2$. It is a mean-field process in which any pair of blocks coalesces at rate
proportional to the product of their masses. In Aldous and Limic (1998) each
extreme eternal version $(\mathbf{X}(t),- \infty < t < \infty)$ of the
multiplicative coalescent was described in three different ways. One of these
specifications matches the (marginal) law of $\mathbf{X}(t)$ to that of the
ordered excursion lengths above past minima of $\{L_{\mathbf{X}}(s) +ts, \,s
\geq 0\}$, where $L_{\mathbf{X}}$ is a certain L\'evy-type process which
(modulo shift and scaling) has infinitesimal drift $-s$ at time $s$.
  Using a modification of the breadth-first-walk construction from Aldous
(1997) and Aldous and Limic (1998), and some new insight from the thesis by
Uribe (2007), this work settles an open problem (3) from Aldous (1997), in the
more general context of Aldous and Limic (1998). Informally speaking,
$\mathbf{X}$ is entirely encoded by $L_{\mathbf{X}}$, and contrary to Aldous'
original intuition, the evolution of time for $\mathbf{X}$ does correspond to
the linear increase in the constant part of the drift of $L_{\mathbf{X}}$. In
the ""standard multiplicative coalescent"" context of Aldous (1997), this result
was first announced by Armend\'ariz in 2001, and obtained in a recent preprint
by Broutin and Marckert, who simultaneously account for the process of excess
edge counts (or marks).
  The novel argument presented here is based on a sequence of relatively
elementary observations. Some of its components (for example, the new dynamic
random graph construction via ""simultaneous"" breadth-first walks) are of
independent interest, and may be useful for obtaining more sophisticated
asymptotic results on near critical random graphs and related processes.

long-lived superparticles are now stringently constrained by existing exotic
searches, we point out that the highly motivated model of gauge mediation with
staus as the next-to-lightest superparticle (NLSP) has received less attention.
We recast LHC searches for heavy stable charged particles, disappearing tracks,
and opposite-flavor leptons with large impact parameters to assess current
constraints on a variety of spectra that contain an NLSP stau, and find that
portions of the parameter space motivated by naturalness are still
experimentally unexplored. We additionally note a gap in the current
experimental search program: same-flavor leptons with large impact parameters
evade the suite of existing searches for long-lived objects. This gap is
especially noteworthy as vetoes on displaced leptons in prompt new physics
searches could be systematically discarding such events. We discuss several
motivated models that can exhibit same-flavor displaced leptons: gauge
mediation with co-NLSP sleptons, extended gauge mediation, R-parity violation,
and lepton-flavored dark matter that freezes in during a matter-dominated era
of the early universe. To address this gap, we propose a straightforward
extension of the CMS search for leptons with large impact parameters, and
project sensitivity to these scenarios at 13 TeV. Throughout this analysis, we
highlight several methods whereby LHC searches for exotic long-lived objects
could potentially improve their sensitivity to the displaced leptons
originating from gauge mediation and beyond.

is through measurements of CMB spectral distortions due to the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect, whose magnitude is directly proportional to
the energy input by AGN. Here we co-add South Pole Telescope SZ (SPT-SZ) survey
data around a large set of massive quiescent elliptical galaxies at z >= 0.5.
We use data from the Blanco Cosmology Survey and VISTA Hemisphere Survey to
create a large catalog of galaxies split up into two redshift bins, with 3394
galaxies at 0.5 <= z <= 1.0 and 924 galaxies at 1.0 <= z <= 1.5, with typical
stellar masses of 1.5 x 10^11 M_Sun. We then co-add the emission around these
galaxies, resulting in a measured tSZ signal at 2.2 sigma significance for the
lower redshift bin and a contaminating signal at 1.1 sigma for the higher
redshift bin. To remove contamination due to dust emission, we use SPT-SZ
source counts to model a contaminant source population in both the SPT-SZ bands
and Planck high-frequency bands for a subset of 937 low-redshift galaxies and
240 high-redshift galaxies. This increases our detection to 3.6 sigma for low
redshifts and 0.9 sigma for high redshifts. We find the mean
angularly-integrated Compton-y values to be 2.2 (-0.7+0.9) x 10^-7 Mpc^2 for

We show that the wave vectors pertinent to resonant first-order diffraction

diffracted waves drive the leaky modes responsible for the resonance effects,
fully-conical mounting imbues reflectors with larger angular tolerance than
their classical counterparts. We quantify the angular-spectral performance of
representative resonant wideband reflectors in conic and classic mounts by
numerical calculations with improved spectra found for fully conic incidence.
Moreover, these predictions are verified experimentally for wideband reflectors
fashioned in crystalline and amorphous silicon in distinct spectral regions

such as computer aided design, data mining, image compression and other
applications with sparse-matrix vector multiplications as a kernel operation.
In many cases it is advantageous to use hypergraphs as they, compared to
graphs, have a more general structure and can be used to model more complex
relationships between groups of objects. This motivates our focus on the
less-studied hypergraph partitioning problem.
  In this paper, we propose a serial multi-level bipartitioning algorithm. One
important step in current heuristics for hypergraph partitioning is clustering
during which similar vertices must be recognized. This can be particularly
difficult in irregular hypergraphs with high variation of vertex degree and
hyperedge size; heuristics that rely on local vertex clustering decisions often
give poor partitioning quality. A novel feature of the proposed algorithm is to
use the techniques of rough set clustering to address this problem. We show
that our proposed algorithm gives on average between 18.8 per cent and 71.1 per
cent better quality on these irregular hypergraphs by comparing it to
state-of-the-art hypergraph partitioning algorithms on benchmarks taken from
real applications.

critically on the calibration of the N/O ratio. However, by using realistic
stellar atmospheres combined with the N/O vs. O/H abundance calibration derived
locally from stars and H II regions, and allowing for the fact that
high-redshift H II regions have both high ionisation parameters \emph{and} high

for convenience. In recent work we studied the effects of including nonlocal
interactions explicitly in the final state for (d,p) reactions, within the
distorted wave Born approximation.
  Purpose: Our goal in this work is to develop an improved formalism for
nonlocal interactions that includes deuteron breakup and to use it to study the
effects of including nonlocal interactions in transfer (d,p) reactions, in both
the deuteron and the proton channel.
  Method: We extend the finite-range adiabatic distorted wave approximation to
include nonlocal nucleon optical potentials. We apply our method to (d,p)
reactions on 16O, 40Ca, 48Ca, 126Sn, 132Sn, and 208Pb at 10, 20 and 50 MeV.
  Results: We find that nonlocality in the deuteron scattering state reduces
the amplitude of the wave function in the nuclear interior, and shifts the wave
function outward. In many cases, this has the effect of increasing the transfer
cross section at the first peak of the angular distributions. This increase was
most significant for heavy targets and for reactions at high energies.
  Conclusions: Our systematic study shows that, if only local optical
potentials are used in the analysis of experimental (d,p) transfer cross
sections, the extracted spectroscopic factors may be incorrect by up to 40% due
to the local approximation.

Networks (DNs) with vulnerable Distributed Energy Resource (DER) nodes. The
adversary model is simultaneous compromise of DER nodes by strategic
manipulation of generation set-points. The loss to the defender (DN operator)
includes loss of voltage regulation and cost of induced load control under
supply-demand mismatch caused by the attack. A 3-stage
Defender-Attacker-Defender (DAD) game is formulated: in Stage 1, the defender
chooses a security strategy to secure a subset of DER nodes; in Stage 2, the
attacker compromises a set of vulnerable DERs and injects false generation
set-points; in Stage 3, the defender responds by controlling loads and
uncompromised DERs. Solving this trilevel optimization problem is hard due to
nonlinear power flows and mixed-integer decision variables. To address this
challenge, the problem is approximated by a tractable formulation based on
linear power flows. The set of critical DER nodes and the set-point
manipulations characterizing the optimal attack strategy are computed. An
iterative greedy approach to compute attacker-defender strategies for the
original nonlinear problem is proposed. These results provide guidelines for

of a local, isolated system in nonequilibrium using the principle of steepest
entropy ascent (SEA), which can be expressed as a variational principle in
thermodynamic state space. The model is able to arrive at the Onsager relations
for such a system. Since no assumption of local equilibrium is made, the
conjugate fluxes and forces, which result, are intrinsic to the subspaces of
the system's state space and are defined using the concepts of hypoequilibrium
state and nonequilibrium intensive properties, which describe the non-mutual
equilibrium status between subspaces of the thermodynamic state space. The
Onsager relations are shown to be a thermodynamic kinematic feature of the
system independent of the specific details of the micro-mechanical dynamics.
Two kinds of relaxation processes are studied with different constraints (i.e.,
conservation laws) corresponding to heat and mass diffusion. Linear behavior in
the near-equilibrium region as well as nonlinear behavior in the
far-from-equilibrium region are discussed. Thermodynamic relations in the
equilibrium and near-equilibrium realm, including the Gibbs relation, the
Clausius inequality, and the Onsager relations, are generalized to the
far-from-equilibrium realm. The variational principle in the space spanned by
the intrinsic conjugate fluxes and forces is expressed via the quadratic
dissipation potential. As an application, the model is applied to the heat and
mass diffusion of a system represented by a single particle ensemble, which can
also be applied to a simple system of many particles. Phenomenological
transport coefficients are also derived in near-equilibrium realm.

show that a water molecule outside and inside (n, n) CNTs (n=4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10)
is stabilized by electron correlation. The adsorption energy of water inside
CNTs decreases quickly with the decrease of curvature (increase of radius) and
the configuration with the oxygen pointing towards the CNT wall is the most
stable one. However, when the water molecule is adsorbed outside the CNT, the
adsorption energy varies only slightly with the curvature and the configuration
with hydrogens pointing towards the CNT wall is the most stable one. We also
use the DF-LCCSD(T) results to parametrize Lennard-Jones (LJ) force fields for
the interaction of water both with the inner and outer sides of CNTs and with
graphene representing the zero curvature limit. It is not possible to reproduce
all DF-LCCSD(T) results for water inside and outside CNTs of different
curvature by a single set of LJ parameters, but two sets have to be used
instead. Each of the two resulting sets can reproduce three out of four minima
of the effective potential curves reasonably well. These LJ models are then
used to calculate the water adsorption energies of larger CNTs, approaching the
graphene limit, thus bridging the gap between CNTs of increasing radius and
flat graphene sheets.

uplink traffic can be broadly classified as either Periodic Update (PU) and
Event Driven (ED). The PU arrivals from different sensors are periodic,
synchronized by the PLC and need to be processed by a prespecified firm latency
deadline. On the other hand, the ED arrivals are random, have low-arrival rate,
but may need to be processed quickly depending upon the criticality of the
application. To accommodate these contrasting Quality-of-Service (QoS)
requirements, we model the utility of PU and ED packets using step function and
sigmoidal functions of latency respectively. Our goal is to maximize the
overall system utility while being proportionally fair to both PU and ED data.
To this end, we propose a novel online QoS-aware packet scheduler that gives
priority to ED data as long as that results the latency deadline is met for PU
data. However as the size of networks increases, we drop the PU packets that
fail to meet latency deadline which reduces congestion and improves overall
system utility. Using extensive simulations, we compare the performance of our
scheme with various scheduling policies such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS),
Earliest-Due-Date (EDD) and (preemptive) priority. We show that our scheme

supermassive stars cannot account for the observed abundance anomalies in NGC

Novae, either involving CO or ONe white dwarfs, could be interesting polluter

conclusions. We also discuss if additional constraints for the first-generation

by applying a Kronig-Penney potential to the gas in the perpendicular direction

decreases continuously as the potential barrier height increases, becoming
inversely proportional to the square root of the barrier height when it is
large enough. This behavior is {\it universal} as it is independent of the
width and spacing of the barriers. The specific heat at constant volume shows a
crossover from 3D to 2D when the height of the potential or the barrier width
increase, in addition to the well known peak related to the Bose-Einstein

localized sample data. Truncating the classical Shannon sampling series results
in an unsatisfactory convergence rate due to the slow decayness of the sinc
function. To overcome this drawback, a simple and highly effective method,
called the Gaussian regularization of the Shannon series, was proposed in the
engineering and has received remarkable attention. It works by multiplying the
sinc function in the Shannon series with a regularized Gaussian function. L.
Qian (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 2003) established the convergence rate of
$O(\sqrt{n}\exp(-\frac{\pi-\delta}2n))$ for this method, where $\delta<\pi$ is
the bandwidth and $n$ is the number of sample data. C. Micchelli {\it et al.}
(J. Complexity, 2009) proposed a different regularized method and obtained the
corresponding convergence rate of
$O(\frac1{\sqrt{n}}\exp(-\frac{\pi-\delta}2n))$. This latter rate is by far the
best among all regularized methods for the Shannon series. However, their
regularized method involves the solving of a linear system and is implicit and
more complicated. The main objective of this note is to show that the Gaussian
regularization of the Shannon series can also achieve the same best convergence
rate as that by C. Micchelli {\it et al}. We also show that the Gaussian
regularization method can improve the convergence rate for the useful average
sampling. Finally, the outstanding performance of numerical experiments
justifies our results.

constant-factor approximations on planar graphs and more generally graphs of
constant orientable genus. This result was extended to non-orientable genus by
[Erickson and Sidiropoulos 2014].
  We show that for any class of \emph{nearly-embeddable} graphs, ATSP admits a
polynomial-time constant-factor approximation. More precisely, we show that for
any fixed $k\geq 0$, there exist $\alpha, \beta>0$, such that ATSP on

state was in the development of the notion of Casimir energy. Now field
theoretic Casimir energies, considered individually, are always infinite. But
differences in Casimir energies (at worst regularized, not renormalized) are
quite often finite --- a fortunate circumstance which luckily made some of the
early calculations, (for instance, for parallel plates and hollow spheres),
tolerably tractable. We shall explore the extent to which this observation can
be made systematic. For instance: What are necessary and sufficient conditions
for Casimir energy differences to be finite (with regularization but without
renormalization)? And, when the Casimir energy differences are not formally
finite, can anything useful nevertheless be said by invoking renormalization?
We shall see that it is the difference in the first few Seeley--DeWitt
coefficients that is central to answering these questions. In particular, for
any collection of conductors (be they perfect or imperfect) and/or dielectrics,
as long as one merely moves them around without changing their shape or volume,
then physically the Casimir energy difference (and so also the physically
interesting Casimir forces) are guaranteed to be finite without invoking any
renormalization.

of optical isolation can be rigorously derived, and corresponds precisely to
the PT transition point. When the couplings to the external ports are unequal,
the isolation ratio exhibits an abrupt jump at the transition point, determined
by the ratio of the couplings. This could be exploited to realize an actively

switched on or off using tiny variations in the inter-resonator separation.

efficiency (ASE) behaves with different system parameters; how to design an
energy-efficient network. Based on stochastic geometry, we obtain the
expression and a tight lower-bound for ASE of Poisson distributed networks
considering multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) transmission. With the help of the
lower-bound, some interesting results are observed. These results are validated
via numerical results for the original expression. We find that ASE can be
viewed as a concave function with respect to the number of antennas and active
users. For the purpose of maximizing ASE, we demonstrate that the optimal
number of active users is a fixed portion of the number of antennas. With
optimal number of active users, we observe that ASE increases linearly with the
number of antennas. Another work of this paper is joint optimization of the
base station (BS) density, the number of antennas and active users to minimize
the network energy consumption. It is discovered that the optimal combination
of the number of antennas and active users is the solution that maximizes the
energy-efficiency. Besides the optimal algorithm, we propose a suboptimal
algorithm to reduce the computational complexity, which can achieve near
optimal performance.

derivation of the field equation recursion method in the abstract theory of

great interest since it has proven to be a powerful tool in developing sharp
bounds for the effective tensor of a composite material. The reason is that the
effective tensor $\bf L_*$ can be interpreted in the general framework of the
abstract theory of composites as the $Z$-operator on a certain orthogonal
$Z(2)$ subspace collection. The base case of the recursion starts with an
orthogonal $Z(2)$ subspace collection on a Hilbert space $\cal H$, the
$Z$-problem, and the associated $Y$-problem. We provide some new conditions for
the solvability of both the $Z$-problem and the associated $Y$-problem. We also
give explicit representations of the associated $Z$-operator and $Y$-operator

from a hierarchy of subspace collections and their associated operators which
leads to a continued fraction representation of the initial effective tensor

reuse affects each user's signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), and hence is one
limiting factor of network performance. In this paper, we propose a
user-centric interference nulling (IN) scheme in a downlink large-scale HetNet
to improve coverage/outage probability by improving each user's SIR. This IN
scheme utilizes at most maximum IN degree of freedom (DoF) at each macro-BS to
avoid interference to uniformly selected macro (pico) users with
signal-to-individual-interference ratio (SIIR) below a macro (pico) IN
threshold, where the maximum IN DoF and the two IN thresholds are three design
parameters. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we first obtain a tractable
expression of the coverage (equivalently outage) probability. Then, we analyze
the asymptotic coverage/outage probability in the low and high SIR threshold
regimes. The analytical results indicate that the maximum IN DoF can affect the
order gain of the outage probability in the low SIR threshold regime, but
cannot affect the order gain of the coverage probability in the high SIR
threshold regime. Moreover, we characterize the optimal maximum IN DoF which
optimizes the asymptotic coverage/outage probability. The optimization results
reveal that the IN scheme can linearly improve the outage probability in the
low SIR threshold regime, but cannot improve the coverage probability in the
high SIR threshold regime. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed
scheme can achieve good gains in coverage/outage probability over a maximum
ratio beamforming scheme and a user-centric almost blank subframes (ABS)
scheme.

small superradiant perturbations grow as expected from linearized studies.
Backreaction then causes the black hole to lose charge and mass until the
perturbation becomes nonsuperradiant, with the final state described by a
stable hairy black hole. For large gauge coupling, the instability extracts a
large amount of charge per unit mass, resulting in greater entropy increase. We
discuss the implications of the observed behavior for the general problem of

effects of divalent and trivalent cations on the higher-order structure of
giant DNA (T4 DNA with 166 kbp). It was found that divalent cations, such as
Mg(2+) and Ca(2+), inhibit DNA compaction induced by a trivalent cation,
spermidine (SPD(3+)). On the other hand, in the absence of SPD(3+), divalent
cations cause the shrinkage of DNA. These experimental observations are
inconsistent with the well-established Debye-Huckel scheme regarding the
shielding effect of counter ions, which is given as the additivity of
contributions of cations with different valences. We interpreted the
competition between 2+ and 3+ cations in terms of the change in the
translational entropy of the counter ions before and after the folding
transition of DNA. For the compaction with SPD(3+), we considered the increase
in translational entropy due to the ion-exchange of the intrinsic monovalent
cations condensing on a highly-charged polyelectrolyte, double-stranded DNA, by
the 3+ cations. In contrast, the presence of 2+ cation decreases the gain of
entropy owe to the ion-exchange between monovalent and 3+ ions.

states against disorder in both the spin-independent terms (including the
chemical potential and the regular spin-conserving hopping) and the
spin-dependent term, i.e., the spin-flip hopping due to the Rashba spin-orbit

the spin-independent disorder, especially when the latter is strong. Meanwhile,
the Majorana bound states are relatively robust against spin-dependent
disorder, as long as the spin-flip hopping is of uniform sign (i.e., the
varying spin-flip hopping term does not change its sign along the chain).
Nevertheless, when the disorder induces sign-flip in spin-flip hopping, the
topological-nontopological phase transition takes place in the

human movement. The interpretation of such models regarding neuronal
implementation of the human motor system is not clear. An important aspects of
optimal control policies is the notion of cost. Optimal control seeks to
minimize a notion of cost, while meeting certain goals. We offer a method to
transform current methods in the literature from their traditional form by
changing the norm by which cost is assessed. We show how sparsity can be
introduced into current optimal approaches that use continuous control signals.
We assess cost using the infinity norm. This results in optimal signals which
can be represented by a small amount of Dirac delta functions. Sparsity has
played an important role in theoretical neuroscience for information processing
(such as vision). In this work, to obtain sparse control signals, the infinity
norm is used as a penalty on the control signal, which is then encoded with
Dirac delta functions. We show, for a basic physical system, a point mass can
be moved between two points in a way that resembles human fast reaching
movements. Despite the sparse nature of the control signal, the movements that
result are continuous and smooth. These control signals are simpler than their
non-sparse counterparts, yet yield comparable results when applied towards
modeling reaching movements. In addition, such sparse control signals resemble
a sequence of spikes, giving this approach a biological interpretation. Actual
neuronal implementations are more complex. However, this work shows, in
principle, that sparsely encoded control signals are a plausible implementation
for the control of reaching movements. Leading techniques for modeling human
movements can easily be adjusted in order to introduce sparsity, with a
biological interpretation and the simplified information content of the control
signal.

effects that are local to some subpopulation, often for reasons of efficiency.
These inferential targets are sometimes data-adaptive, in that they are
dependent on the empirical distribution of the data. In this short note, we
show that if researchers are willing to adapt the inferential target on the
basis of efficiency, then extraordinary gains in precision can be obtained.
Specifically, when causal effects are heterogeneous, any asymptotically normal
and root-$n$ consistent estimator of the population average causal effect is
superefficient for a data-adaptive local average causal effect. Our result
illustrates the fundamental gain in statistical certainty afforded by
indifference about the inferential target.

a rich variety of electronic properties1-17. Therefore, they are predicted to
be the building blocks in next-generation nanoelectronic devices.
Theoretically, it has been demonstrated that armchair GNRs can be divided into
three families, i.e., Na = 3p, Na = 3p + 1, and Na = 3p + 2 (here Na is the
number of dimer lines across the ribbon width and p is an integer), according
to their electronic structures, and the energy gaps for the three families are
quite different even with the same p1,3-6. However, a systematic experimental
verification of this fundamental prediction is still lacking, owing to very
limited atomic-level control of the width of the armchair GNRs
investigated7,9,10,13,17. Here, we studied electronic structures of the
armchair GNRs with atomically well-defined widths ranging from Na = 6 to Na =
26 by using scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). Our result demonstrated
explicitly that all the studied armchair GNRs exhibit semiconducting gaps due
to quantum confinement and, more importantly, the observed gaps as a function
of Na are well grouped into the three categories, as predicted by
density-functional theory calculations3. Such a result indicated that we can
tune the electronic properties of the armchair GNRs dramatically by simply
adding or cutting one carbon dimer line along the ribbon width.

second class of devices we have incorporated in the phase map a geometric phase
to achieve for the first time chiral imaging: the projection of different

band gap, circular polarization dependent optical transitions, and valence band
(VB) spin band splitting at the $K$ and $-K$ points. These properties can be
described within a minimal model, called the massive Dirac fermion model for

relative ranking of peers without any absolute evaluation of their past. This
is more significant when all the peers responding to a query, are malicious. In
such a situation, we can only know that who is better among them without
knowing their rank in the whole network. In this paper, we are proposing a new
algorithm which accounts for the past behavior of the peers and will estimate
the absolute value of the trust of peers. Consequently, we can suitably
identify them as a good peers or malicious peers. Our algorithm converges at
some global consensus much faster by choosing suitable parameters. Because of
its absolute nature it will equally load all the peers in network. It will also
reduce the inauthentic download in the network which was not possible in

discrete-time continuous-space stochastic process to attack this problem. As a
first criterion of quantifying the relative instability among T periodic

distribution is related to the contributions to the transition rate from each

both in nature and in biotechnological applications. At finite temperatures,
inhomogeneous polymers exhibit non-trivial thermal fluctuations. In a broader
context, these are relatively simple examples for fluctuations in spatially
inhomogeneous systems, which are less understood compared to their homogeneous
counterparts. We develop a statistical theory of torsional, extensional and
bending Gaussian fluctuations of inhomogeneous polymers, where the
inhomogeneity is an inclusion of variable size and mechanical properties, using
both continuum and discrete approaches. First, we analytically calculate the
complete eigenvalue and eigenmode spectrum of the inhomogeneous polymer within
a continuum field theory. In particular, we show that the wavenumber inside and
outside of the inclusion is nearly linear in the eigenvalue index, with a
nontrivial coefficient. Second, we solve the corresponding discrete problem,
and highlight fundamental differences between the continuum and discrete
spectra. In particular, we demonstrate that above a certain wavenumber the
discrete spectrum changes qualitatively and discrete evanescent eigenmodes,
that do not have continuum counterparts, emerge. The statistical thermodynamic
implications of these differences are then explored by calculating
fluctuation-induced forces associated with free-energy variations with either
the inclusion properties (e.g.~inhomogeneity formed by adsorbing molecules) or
with an external geometric constraint. The former, which is the
fluctuation-induced contribution to the adsorbing molecules binding force, is
shown to be affected by short wavelengths and thus cannot be calculated using
the continuum approach. The latter, on the other hand, is shown to be dominated
by long wavelength shape fluctuations and hence is properly described by the
continuum theory.

for $S_i \in \mathcal G_{L,p}(m+1)$ with an extra term in some special case. We
provide a simple criterion on when the extra term is necessary, and we compute
the extra term explicitly. We also give a recursive relation to compute
$r(n,T)$, for any $T \in \mathcal G_{L,p}(m)$, by using the number of
representations of some integers by lattices in $\mathcal G_{L,p}(m+1)$ for an

mesh is definitely a challenging task. The basic requirement is to satisfy both
criteria concerning the regularity of the surface and aesthetic concepts. With
regard to the aesthetic quality, it is well known that interpolatory methods
often produce shape artifacts when the data points are unevenly spaced. In the
univariate setting, this problem can be overcome, or at least mitigated, by
exploiting a proper non-uniform parametrization, that accounts for the geometry
of the data. Moreover, recently, the same principle has been generalized and
proven to be effective in the context of bivariate interpolatory subdivision
schemes. In this paper, we propose a construction for parametric surfaces of
good aesthetic quality and high smoothness that interpolate quadrilateral
meshes of arbitrary topology. In the classical tensor product setting the same
parameter interval must be shared by an entire row or column of mesh edges.
Conversely, in this paper, we assign a different parameter interval to each
edge of the mesh. This particular structure, which we call an augmented
parametrization, allows us to interpolate each section polyline of the mesh at
parameters values that prevent wiggling of the resulting curve or other
interpolation artifacts. This yields high quality interpolatory surfaces. The
proposed surfaces are a generalization of the local univariate spline
interpolants introduced in Beccari et al.(2013) and Antonelli et al.(2014),
that can have arbitrary continuity and arbitrary order of polynomial
reproduction. In particular, these surfaces retain the same smoothness of the
underlying class of univariate splines in the regular regions of the mesh.
Moreover, in mesh regions containing vertices of valence other than 4, we
suitably define G1- or G2-continuous surface patches that join the neighboring
regular ones.

quick powerful jumps. Such an aptness is used to escape from high shear
regions, which may be caused either by flow per- turbations, produced by a
large predator (i.e., fish larvae), or by the inherent highly turbulent
dynamics of the ocean. Through a combined experimental and numerical study, we
investigate the impact of jumping behaviour on the small-scale patchiness of
copepods in a turbulent environment. Recorded velocity tracks of copepods
displaying escape response jumps in still water are here used to define and
tune a Lagrangian Copepod (LC) model. The model is further employed to simulate
the behaviour of thousands of copepods in a fully developed hydrodynamic
turbulent flow obtained by direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes
equations. First, we show that the LC velocity statistics is in qualitative
agreement with available experimental observations of copepods in tur- bulence.
Second, we quantify the clustering of LC, via the fractal dimension $D_2$. We
show that $D_2$ can be as low as ~ 2.3 and that it critically depends on the
shear-rate sensitivity of the proposed LC model, in particular it exhibits a
minimum in a narrow range of shear-rate values. We further investigate the
effect of jump intensity, jump orientation and geometrical aspect ratio of the
copepods on the small-scale spatial distribution. At last, possible ecological
implications of the observed clustering on encounter rates and mating success
are discussed

software that have no serious faults. In this case, object-oriented (OO)

lines towards $37$ disks with APEX, and supplemented it with [CII] data from
the literature. The data are interpreted using a grid of models produced with
the DALI code. We also investigate how well the gas-phase carbon abundance can
be determined in light of parameter uncertainties.
  The CO$\,6$--$5$ line is detected in $13$ out of $33$ sources, the
[CI]$\,1$--$0$ in $6$ out of $12$, and the [CI]$\,2$--$1$ in $1$ out of $33$.
With deep integrations, the first unambiguous detections of [CI]~$1$--$0$ in
disks are obtained, in TW~Hya and HD~100546.
  Gas-phase carbon abundance reductions of a factor $5$--$10$ or more can be
identified robustly based on CO and [CI] detections. The atomic carbon
detection in TW~Hya confirms a factor $100$ reduction of [C]/[H]$_{\rm gas}$ in
that disk, while the data are consistent with an ISM-like carbon abundance for
HD~100546. In addition, BP~Tau, T~Cha, HD~139614, HD~141569, and HD~100453 are
either carbon-depleted or gas-poor disks. The low [CI]~$2$--$1$ detection rates
in the survey mostly reflect insufficient sensitivity to detect T~Tauri disks.
The Herbig~Ae/Be disks with CO and [CII] upper limits below the models are
debris disk like systems. A roughly order of magnitude increase in sensitivity
compared to our survey is required to obtain useful constraints on the

Analysis (JLA) supernova sample, we explore the possible redshift-dependence of
stretch-luminosity parameter $\alpha$ and color-luminosity parameter $\beta$.
The basic idea is to divide the JLA sample into different redshift bins,
assuming that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are piecewise constants. Then, by
constraining the $\Lambda$CDM model, we check the consistency of cosmology-fit
results given by the SN sample of each redshift bin. We also adopt the same
technique to explore the possible evolution of $\beta$ in various subsamples of
JLA. Using the full JLA data, we find that $\alpha$ is always consistent with a
constant. In contrast, at high redshift $\beta$ has a significant trend of
decreasing, at $\sim 3.5\sigma$ confidence level (CL). Moreover, we find that
low-$z$ subsample favors a constant $\beta$; in contrast, SDSS and SNLS
subsamples favor a decreasing $\beta$ at 2$\sigma$ and $3.3\sigma$ CL,
respectively. Besides, by using a binned parameterization of $\beta$, we study
the impacts of $\beta$'s evolution on parameter estimation. We find that
compared with a constant $\beta$, a varying $\beta$ yields a larger best-fit
value of fractional matter density $\Omega_{m0}$, which slightly deviates from
the best-fit result given by other cosmological observations. However, for both
the varying $\beta$ and the constant $\beta$ cases, the $1\sigma$ regions of
$\Omega_{m0}$ are still consistent with the result given by other observations.

determine if a given infinite series converges, diverges, or oscillates. But
unfortunately, for very many infinite series all the existing tests can fail to
provide definitive answers. In this article we propose a novel Bayesian theory
for assessment of convergence properties of any given infinite series.
Remarkably, this theory attempts to provide conclusive answers to the question
of convergence even where all the existing tests of convergence fail. We apply
our ideas to seven different examples, obtaining very encouraging results.
Importantly, we also apply our ideas to investigate the Riemann Hypothesis, and
obtain results that do not completely support the conjecture.
  We also extend our ideas to develop a Bayesian theory on oscillating series,
where we allow even infinite number of limit points. Analysis of Riemann
Hypothesis using Bayesian multiple limit points theory yielded almost identical
results as the Bayesian theory of convergence assessment.

conserved quantum numbers (charge, strangeness, baryon number) are conserved
locally in spatially restricted correlation clusters. Their size is determined
by two time scales: the equilibration time specifying the formation of a

for the suppression observed for strangeness production in elementary

superposition of individual collisions in high energy heavy ion interactions
leads to higher energy densities, resulting in much later hadronization and
hence much larger hadronization volumes. This largely removes the causality

parallax predicts a number of stars in the solar neighborhood that are
sub-luminous at a given photospheric abundance. We test this hypothesis using
spectroscopic abundances for a subset of stars in the Hipparcos catalog, which
occupy the same region as the Pleiades in the color-magnitude diagram. We
derive stellar parameters for 170 nearby G and K type field dwarfs in the
Hipparcos catalog based on high-resolution spectra obtained using KPNO 4-m

fitting relations by $\Delta M_V \geq 0.3$ mag, but the differences are
marginal at a $2\sigma$ level partly due to relatively large parallax errors.

signatures of youth as determined from lithium absorption line strengths and
$R'_{\rm HK}$ chromospheric activity indices are consistent with the Hipparcos
parallaxes. Our result is contradictory to a suggestion that the Pleiades

suprathermal rotation energy of molecules in magnetic fields, a necessary
condition for their alignment. It relies upon the Lorentz force perturbing the
motion of every atom of the structure, as each is known to carry its own net
electric charge because of spatial fluctuations in electron density. If the
molecule is large enough that the frequency of its lowest-frequency phonon lies
near or below the rotation frequency, then the rotation couples with the
molecular normal modes and energy flows from the former to the latter. The rate
of this exchange is very fast, and the vibrational energy is radiated away in
the IR at a still faster rate, which completes the removal of rotation energy.
The energy decay rate scales like the field intensity, the initial angular
velocity, the number of atoms in the grain and the inverse of the moment of
inertia. It does not depend on the susceptibility. Here, the focus is on
carbon-rich molecules which are diamagnetic. The same process must occur if the
molecule is paramagnetic or bathes in an electric field instead.
  A semi-empirical method of chemical modeling was used extensively to
illustrate and quantify these concepts as applied to a hydrocarbon molecule.
The motion of a rotating molecule in a field was monitored in time so as to
reveal the energy transfer and visualize the evolution of its orientation

in the optically-thick disc midplane out to ~0.4 AU. The two enstatite-rich

contains multiple high-metallicity regions with sharp edges. Relative to an
azimuthal average, the deviations of metallicity and surface brightness are
correlated, and the temperature is inversely correlated, as expected if the
larger scale asymmetries in the cluster are dominated by sloshing motions.
Around the western cold front are a series of ~7 kpc 'notches', suggestive of
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The cold front width varies from 4 kpc down to
close to the electron mean free path. Inside the front are multiple metallicity
blobs on scales of 5-10 kpc, which could have been uplifted by AGN activity,
also explaining the central metallicity drop and flat inner metallicity
profile. Close to the nucleus are multiple shocks, including a 1.9-kpc-radius
inner shell-like structure and a weak 1.1-1.4 Mach number shock around the
central cavities. Within a 10 kpc radius are 9 depressions in surface
brightness, several of which appear to be associated with radio emission. The
shocks and cavities imply that the nucleus has been repeatedly active on 5-10
Myr timescales, indicating a tight balance between heating and cooling. We
confirm the presence of a series of linear quasi-periodic structures. If they
are sound waves, the ~5 kpc spacing implies a period of 6 Myr, similar to the
ages of the shocks and cavities. Alternatively, these structures may be

stochastic dynamics modelled as interacting sequences of discrete events
including systems of biochemical reactions or earthquake occurrences, networks
of queuing processes or spiking neurons, and epidemic and opinion formation
processes on social networks. Empirically, the inter-event times of various
phenomena obey long-tailed distributions. The Gillespie algorithm and its
variants either assume Poisson processes (i.e., exponentially distributed
inter-event times), use particular functions for time courses of the event
rate, or work for non-Poissonian renewal processes, including the case of
long-tailed distributions of inter-event times, but at a high computational
cost. In the present study, we propose an innovative Gillespie algorithm for
renewal processes on the basis of the Laplace transform. The algorithm makes
use of the fact that a class of point processes is represented as a mixture of
Poisson processes with different event rates. The method is applicable to
multivariate renewal processes whose survival function of inter-event times is
completely monotone. It is an exact algorithm and works faster than a recently
proposed Gillespie algorithm for general renewal processes, which is exact only
in the limit of infinitely many processes. We also propose a method to generate
sequences of event times with a tunable amount of positive correlation between
inter-event times. We demonstrate our algorithm with exact simulations of
epidemic processes on networks, finding that a realistic amount of positive
correlation in inter-event times only slightly affects the epidemic dynamics.

In this
period we have witnessed breakthroughs both in fundamental and applied
research. However, the development of graphene devices for mass production has
not yet reached the same level of progress. The architecture of graphene
field-effect transistors (FET) has not significantly changed, and the
integration of devices at the wafer scale has generally not been sought.
Currently, whenever an electrolyte-gated FET (EGFET) is used, an external,
cumbersome, out-of-plane gate electrode is required. Here, an alternative
architecture for graphene EGFET is presented. In this architecture, source,
drain, and gate are in the same plane, eliminating the need for an external
gate electrode and the use of an additional reservoir to confine the
electrolyte inside the transistor active zone. This planar structure with an
integrated gate allows for wafer-scale fabrication of high-performance graphene
EGFETs, with carrier mobility up to 1800 cm2 V-1 s-1. As a proof-of principle,
a chemical sensor was achieved. It is shown that the sensor can discriminate
between saline solutions of different concentrations. The proposed architecture
will facilitate the mass production of graphene sensors, materializing the
potential of previous achievements in fundamental and applied graphene
research.

  Proceedings of the 30th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 16)",,,,"cs.AI cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given an election, a preferred candidate p, and a budget, the SHIFT BRIBERY
problem asks whether p can win the election after shifting p higher in some
voters' preference orders. Of course, shifting comes at a price (depending on
the voter and on the extent of the shift) and one must not exceed the given
budget. We study the (parameterized) computational complexity of S HIFT BRIBERY
for multiwinner voting rules where winning the election means to be part of
some winning committee. We focus on the well-established SNTV, Bloc, k-Borda,
and Chamberlin-Courant rules, as well as on approximate variants of the
Chamberlin-Courant rule, since the original rule is NP-hard to compute. We show
that SHIFT BRIBERY tends to be harder in the multiwinner setting than in the
single-winner one by showing settings where SHIFT BRIBERY is easy in the
single-winner cases, but is hard (and hard to approximate) in the multiwinner
ones. Moreover, we show that the non-monotonicity of those rules which are
based on approximation algorithms for the Chamberlin-Courant rule sometimes
affects the complexity of SHIFT BRIBERY.

diagonals and areas can be reduced to solving certain Diophantine equations. We
look at a number of such questions including the question of approximating
arbitrary triangles and quadrilaterals by those with rational sides,diagonals
and areas. We transform these problems into questions on the existence of
infinitely many rational solutions on a two parameter family of quartic curves.
This is further transformed to a two parameter family of elliptic curves to
deduce our main result concerning density of points on a line which are at a
rational distance from three collinear points (Theorem 4). We deduce from this
a new proof of density of rational quadrilaterals in the space of all
quadrilaterals (Theorem 39). The other main result (Theorem 3) of this article
is on the density of rational triangles which is related to analyzing rational
points on the unit circle. Interestingly, this enables us to deduce that
parallelograms with rational sides and area are dense in the class of all
parallelograms.
  We also give a criterion for density of certain sets in topological spaces
using local product structure and prove the density Theorem 6 in the appendix
section. An application of this proves the density of rational points as stated
in Theorem 31.

understanding of the structural diversity that is encompassed within the LDA
state and the dynamic processes that take place upon heating LDA. Heating the
high-pressure ice VIII phase at ambient pressure is a remarkable example of
temperature-induced amorphisation yielding LDA. We investigate this process in
detail using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, and show that the LDA
obtained from ice VIII is structurally different from the more 'traditional'
states of LDA which are approached upon thermal annealing. This new structural
relaxation pathway involves an increase of structural order on the intermediate
range length scale. In contrast with other LDA materials the local structure is
more ordered initially and becomes slightly more disordered upon annealing. We
also show that the cascade of phase transitions upon heating ice VIII at

the structural peculiarities of LDA from ice VIII. Overall, this study shows
that LDA is a structurally more diverse material than previously appreciated.

polarization in which the quantity $P = Q+ iU$ is linearly combined at
different frequencies using complex coefficients. This is the most general
linear combination of the $Q$ and $U$ Stokes parameters which preserves the
physical coherence of the residual contribution on the CMB estimation. The
approach is applied to the internal linear combination (ILC) and the internal
template fitting (ITF) methodologies. The variance of $P$ of the resulting map
is minimized to compute the coefficients of the linear combination. One of the
key aspects of this procedure is that it serves to account for a global
frequency-dependent shift of the polarization phase. Although in the standard
case, in which no global E-B transference depending on frequency is expected in
the foreground components, minimizing $\left\langle |P|^2\right\rangle$ is
similar to minimizing $\left\langle Q^2\right\rangle$ and $\left\langle
U^2\right\rangle$ separately (as previous methodologies proceed), multiplying
$Q$ and $U$ by different coefficients induces arbitrary changes in the
polarization angle and it does not preserve the coherence between the spinorial
components. The approach is tested on simulations, obtaining a similar residual
level with respect to the one obtained with other implementations of the ILC,
and perceiving the polarization rotation of a toy model with the frequency
dependence of the Faraday rotation.

stellar population synthesis models to derive reliable Ionization Correction
Factors (ICFs) for the sulphur in star-forming regions. These models cover a
large range of nebular parameters and yielding ionic abundances in consonance
with those derived through optical and infrared observational data of
star-forming regions. From our theoretical ICFs, we suggested an {\alpha} value
of 3.27 in the classical Stasinska formulae. We compared the total sulphur
abundance in the gas phase of a large sample of objects by using our
Theoretical ICF and other approaches. In average, the differences between the
determinations via the use of the different ICFs considered are similar to the
uncertainties in the S/H estimations. Nevertheless, we noted that for some
objects it could reach up to about 0.3 dex for the low metallicity regime.
Despite of the large scatter of the points, we found a trend of S/O ratio to
decrease with the metallicity, independently of the ICF used to compute the
sulphur total abundance.

means. Inspired by Lyapunov optimization theory, the intractable stochastic
optimization problem is transformed into a tractable deterministic optimization
problem, which is a mixed-integer resource management problem. By exploiting
the specific problem structure, the mixed-integer resource management problem
is equivalently transformed into a single variable problem, which can be
effectively solved by the golden section search method with guaranteed global
optimality. Finally, we propose a dynamic resource management algorithm to
solve the original stochastic optimization problem. Simulation results show the
advantage of the proposed dynamic algorithm and reveal that there exists a
fundamental tradeoff between delay requirements and power consumption.

the Vehicular Delay Tolerant Network (VDTN). It is an application of the mobile
DTN where nodes relay messages in the network using a store-carry-forward
approach. Due to its high mobility, it suffers frequent disconnections and also
congestions at nodes which leads to message drops. To minimize the rate of
message drops and so optimize the probability of message delivery so that
drivers are increasingly aware of the situation of the road, we propose a
congestion control mechanism: Congestion Aware Spray and Wait (CASaW) protocol
in this work so as to optimize the rate of message delivery to its destination
and so increase the awareness of drivers in the vehicular environment thereby
improve road safety. The results have shown that our proposition performed
better than other classical VDTN protocols in terms of message delivery
probability and rate of packet drops performance measures. We used the
Opportunistic Networking Environment (ONE) simulator to implement the classical
VDTN protocols: the PROPHET protocol, the Epidemic protocol, the MaxProp

better performance for the congestion control mechanism we propose as it
maintains a good message delivery rate as well as minimize the rate of packet
losses thereby optimizing the chances of messages getting to their destinations

pipeline using as observational constraints the effective temperatures, [Fe/H],
masses, and radii of the two stars. In a reference scenario of mild
overshooting $\beta = 0.2$ for the synthetic data, we found both large
statistical uncertainties and biases on the estimated $\beta$. For the first
80% of the MS evolution, $\beta$ is biased and practically unconstrained in the
whole explored range [0.0; 0.4]. In the last 5% of the MS the bias vanishes and
the $1 \sigma$ error is about 0.05. For synthetic data computed with $\beta =
0.0$, the estimated $\beta$ is biased by about 0.12 in the first 80% of the MS
evolution, and by 0.05 afterwards. Assuming an uncertainty of $\pm 1$ in the
helium-to-metal enrichment ratio $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$, we found that in the
terminal part of the MS evolution the error on the estimated $\beta$ values
ranges from -0.05 to +0.10, while $\beta$ is basically unconstrained throughout
the explored range at earlier evolutionary stages. A uniform variation of $\pm
0.24$ in the mixing-length parameter around the solar-calibrated value causes
in last 5% of the MS an uncertainty from -0.09 to +0.15. A complete neglect of
diffusion in the stellar evolution computations produces a $1 \sigma$
uncertainty of $\pm 0.08$ in the last 5% of the MS, while $\beta$ is

It is demonstraonated that the non-Markovian nature of the process is quite

emission was consistent with star formation. This type of analysis allowed us
to improve the statistics with respect to previous studies, and to properly
estimate the oxygen distribution across the entire disc to a distance of up to
3-4 disc effective radii (r$_e$). We confirm the results obtained from
classical HII region analysis. In addition to the general negative gradient, an
outer flattening can be observed in the oxygen abundance radial profile. An
inner drop is also found in some cases. There is a common abundance gradient
between 0.5 and 2.0 r$_e$ of $\alpha_{O/H} = -\,0.075\,\rm{dex}/r_e$ with a
scatter of $\sigma = 0.016\,\rm{dex}/r_e$ when normalising the distances to the
disc effective radius. By performing a set of Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, we
determined that this slope is independent of other galaxy properties, such as
morphology, absolute magnitude, and the presence or absence of bars. In
particular, barred galaxies do not seem to display shallower gradients, as
predicted by numerical simulations. Interestingly, we find that most of the
galaxies in the sample with reliable oxygen abundance values beyond $\sim 2$
effective radii (57 galaxies) present a flattening of the abundance gradient in
these outer regions. This flattening is not associated with any morphological
feature, which suggests that it is a common property of disc galaxies. Finally,
we detect a drop or truncation of the abundance in the inner regions of 27
galaxies in the sample; this is only visible for the most massive galaxies.

spontaneous emission into evanescent and radiation modes and study the angular
densities of the rates in the space of wave vectors for the field modes. We
show that, when the ellipticity of the atomic dipole is not zero, the angular

the angular density of the spontaneous emission rate under central inversion in

and occurs when the ellipticity vector of the atomic dipole polarization
overlaps with the ellipticity vector of the field mode polarization. Due to the
fast decay of the field in the evanescent modes, the difference between the
rates of spontaneous emission into evanescent modes with opposite in-plane wave
vectors decreases monotonically with increasing distance from the atom to the
interface. Due to the oscillatory behavior of the interference between the
emitted and reflected fields, the difference between the rates of spontaneous

with increasing distance from the atom to the interface. This difference can be
positive or negative, depending on the atom-interface distance, and is zero for

of velocity gradients due to the Keplerian rotation of the disk and intensity
variations in the CO background as a function of velocity allows us to directly

from the emitted continuum radiation. The dust disk absorbs the radiation from
the CO clouds at several velocities. We derive very low dust temperatures, 5 to
7 K at radii around 100 au, which is much lower than most model predictions.
The dust optical depth is $> 0.2$ at 230 GHz, and the scale height at 100 au is

information, especially with the emergence of more advanced experimental
implementations of computation and secure communication. Within this, the
theory of device-independent robust self-testing via Bell tests has reached a
level of maturity now that many quantum states and measurements can be verified
without direct access to the quantum systems: interaction with the devices is
solely classical. However, the requirements for this robust level of
verification are daunting and require high levels of experimental accuracy. In
this paper we discuss the possibility of self-testing where we have direct
access to part of the quantum device. This motivates the study of self-testing
via EPR-steering, an intermediate form of entanglement verification between
full state tomography and a Bell test. Quantum non-locality implies
EPR-steering so results in the former can apply in the latter, but we ask what
advantages may be gleaned from the latter over the former given that one can do
partial state tomography. We show in the case of self-testing a maximally
entangled two-qubit state, or ebit, EPR-steering allows for simpler analysis
and better error tolerance than in the case of full device-independence. On the
other hand, this improvement is only a constant improvement and (up to
constants) is the best one can hope for. Finally, we indicate that the main
advantage in self-testing based on EPR-steering could be in the case of
self-testing multi-partite quantum states and measurements. For example, it may
be easier to establish a tensor product structure for a particular party's
Hilbert space even if we do not have access to their part of the global quantum
system.

$n$ compact bosons. Regime I for $a_{2n}^{(2)}$ is related with $a_{2n}^{(2)}$
Toda and involves $n$ compact bosons, while regime II is related instead with
$B^{(1)}(0,n)$ super Toda, and involves in addition a single Majorana fermion.
The most interesting is regime III, where {\sl non-compact} degrees of freedom
appear, generalising the emergence of the Euclidean black hole CFT in the
$a_{2}^{(2)}$ case. For $a_{2n}^{(2)}$ we find a continuum limit made of $n$
compact and $n$ non-compact bosons, while for $a_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ we find $n$
compact and $n-1$ non-compact bosons. We also find deep relations between

satellite altimetry using a technique from nonlinear dynamical systems that
enables objective (i.e., observer-independent) eddy framing. Such objectively
detected eddies have Lagrangian (material) boundaries that remain coherent
(unfilamented) over the detection period. The ring preserves a quite compact
material entity for a period of about 2 years even after most initial coherence
is lost within 5 months after detection. We attribute this to the successive
development of short-term coherent material boundaries around the ring. These
boundaries provide effective short-term shielding for the ring, which prevents
a large fraction of the ring's interior from being mixed with the ambient
turbulent flow. We show that such coherence regain events cannot be inferred
from Eulerian analysis. This process is terminated by a ring-splitting event
which marks the ring demise, near the South American coast. The genesis of the
ring is characterized by a ring-merging event away from the Agulhas
retroflection, followed by a 4-month-long partial coherence stage, scenario
that is quite different than a simple current occlusion and subsequent eddy
pinch off.

two- and three-dimensional simulations have been carried out using the hybrid
method, wherein the ions are treated as particles and the electron response is

instability driven at the upstream edge of the foot by the reflected-gyrating
ions. In 3-D simulations we show for the first time that the dominant
microstructure is due to a coupling between field-parallel propagating
fluctuations in the ramp and the motion of the reflected ions. This results in
a pattern of fluctuations counter-propagating across the surface of the shock
at an angle inclined to the magnetic field direction, due to a combination of
field-parallel motion at the Alfv\'en speed of the ramp, and motion in the

astrophysics, for example nucleosynthesis yields, supernova progenitor models
and understanding physics under extreme conditions. Turbulence occurs in stars
primarily due to nuclear burning at different mass coordinates within the star.
The understanding and correct treatment of turbulence and turbulent mixing at
convective boundaries in stellar models has been studied for decades but still
lacks a definitive solution. This paper presents initial results of a study on
convective boundary mixing (CBM) in massive stars. The 'stiffness' of a
convective boundary can be quantified using the bulk Richardson number
($\textrm{Ri}_B$), the ratio of the potential energy for restoration of the
boundary to the kinetic energy of turbulent eddies. A 'stiff' boundary
($\textrm{Ri}_B \sim 10^4$) will suppress CBM, whereas in the opposite case a
'soft' boundary ($\textrm{Ri}_B \sim 10$) will be more susceptible to CBM. One
of the key results obtained so far is that lower convective boundaries (closer
to the centre) of nuclear burning shells are 'stiffer' than the corresponding
upper boundaries, implying limited CBM at lower shell boundaries. This is in
agreement with 3D hydrodynamic simulations carried out by Meakin and Arnett
[The Astrophysical Journal 667:448-475, 2007]. This result also has
implications for new CBM prescriptions in massive stars as well as for nuclear
burning flame front propagation in Super-Asymptotic Giant Branch stars and also
the onset of novae.

appear to be centered around a size of 50 individuals. To understand these
observations we propose a voter model that is built around the principle of
triadic closure. It explicitly models the co-evolution of node- and
link-dynamics across different layers of the multiplex. Depending on link- and
node fluctuation rates, the model exhibits an anomalous shattered fragmentation
transition, where one layer fragments from one large component into many small
components. The observed community size distributions are in good agreement
with the predicted fragmentation in the model. We show that the empirical
pairwise similarities of network layers, in terms of link overlap and degree

detailed features of the fragmentation in societies can be traced back to the

In this scheme the gradient flow equation is written in terms of the

$\lambda$ in a manner analogous to the higher derivative regularization. No
extra divergence is induced in the interaction of the probe variable
$\Phi(t,x)$ and the 4-dimensional dynamical variable $\phi(x)$ which is defined
in renormalized perturbation theory. The finiteness to all orders in
perturbation theory is established by power counting argument in the context of
$D+1$ dimensional field theory. This illustrates that one can formulate the
gradient flow for the simple but important $\lambda\phi^{4}$ theory in addition

measuring dark matter substructure in distant galaxies. However, before using
these flux-ratio anomalies to test galaxy formation models, it is imperative to
ascertain that the given anomalies are indeed due to the presence of dark
matter substructure and not due to some other component of the lensing galaxy
halo or to propagation effects. Here we present the case of CLASS~B1555+375,
which has a strong radio-wavelength flux-ratio anomaly. Our high-resolution
near-infrared Keck~II adaptive optics imaging and archival Hubble Space
Telescope data reveal the lensing galaxy in this system to have a clear edge-on
disc component that crosses directly over the pair of images that exhibit the
flux-ratio anomaly. We find that simple models that include the disc can
reproduce the cm-wavelength flux-ratio anomaly without requiring additional
dark matter substructure. Although further studies are required, our results
suggest the assumption that all flux-ratio anomalies are due to a population of
dark matter sub-haloes may be incorrect, and analyses that do not account for
the full complexity of the lens macro-model may overestimate the substructure
mass fraction in massive lensing galaxies.

on-board sensing and communication as well as substantial human effort in order
to ensure avoidance of obstacles and collisions. The increased cost serves as
an impediment to the emergence and development of broader UAV applications. The

associated costs for avoiding such obstacles; and (ii) use of well-developed

barrier to entry into new UAV-applications market. Finally, this article
proposes a new decoupling scheme for conflict-free transitions between edges of

runtime systems, which schedule such collections of tasks, enable more

asymptotic execution time. Task dependences become materialized in different
forms, depending upon the synchronization model available with the targeted
runtime.
  We explore the different ways of programming EDTs using each synchronization
model, and identify important sources of overhead associated with them. We
evaluate these programming schemes according to the cost they entail in terms
of sequential start-up, in-flight task management, space used for
synchronization objects, and garbage collection of these objects.
  While our implementation and evaluation take place in a polyhedral compiler,
the presented overhead cost analysis is useful in the more general context of

weighting method the hybrid COAW algorithm is presented to solve
multi-objective problems. Cuckoo algorithm is an efficient and structured
method for solving nonlinear continuous problems. The created Pareto frontiers
of the COAW proposed algorithm are exact and have good dispersion. This method
has a high speed in finding the Pareto frontiers and identifies the beginning
and end points of Pareto frontiers properly. In order to validation the
proposed algorithm, several experimental problems were analyzed. The results of
which indicate the proper effectiveness of COAW algorithm for solving
multi-objective problems.
