states that the emissivity is equal to the absorptivity for isothermal bodies.
For a finite size system, absorptivity is replaced by an absorption cross
section. Here, we study the link between thermal emission and absorption by a
finite size object which is not isothermal. We define a local absorption rate
for a given incident plane wave and we prove that it is equal to the local
emissivity rate. Hence, Kirchhoff law can be extended to anisothermal media. A
practical consequence is the possibility of analysing thermal radiation by a
variety of non-equilibrium systems such as microwave radiation in geophysical
remote sensing or X-UV radiation by plasmas. This result provides a theoretical
framework to analyse thermal emission by hot electrons in quantum wells, tunnel
junctions or graphene. It paves the way to the design of a new generation of

antennas. The antennas control the emission spectrum, direction and

dynamics of dissipative evolution equations is studied for the model examples

different scenarios of this effect are demonstrated. According to the first
scenario, the dissipation mechanism is not affected and the diameter of the
global attractor remains uniformly bounded with respect to the very large
dispersion coefficient. However, the limit equation, as the dispersion
parameter tends to infinity, becomes a gradient system. Therefore, adding the
large dispersion term actually suppresses the non-trivial dynamics. According
to the second scenario, neither the dissipation mechanism, nor the dynamics are
essentially affected by the large dispersion and the limit dynamics remains
complicated (chaotic). Finally, it is demonstrated in the third scenario that
the dissipation mechanism is completely destroyed by the large dispersion, and
that the diameter of the global attractor grows together with the growth of the

spacetime, the structure of which is exclusively specified by the premetric
Maxwell equations and a fourth rank electromagnetic response tensor density
$\chi^{ijkl}= -\chi^{jikl}= -\chi^{ijlk}$ with 36 independent components. This
tensor density incorporates the permittivities, permeabilities, and the
magneto-electric moduli of spacetime. No metric, no connection, no further
property is prescribed. If we forbid birefringence (double-refraction) in this
model of spacetime, we eventually end up with the fields of an axion, a
dilaton, and the 10 components of a metric tensor with Lorentz signature. If
the dilaton becomes a constant (the vacuum admittance) and the axion field
vanishes, we recover the Riemannian spacetime of general relativity theory.
Thus, the metric is encapsulated in $\chi^{ijkl}$, it can be derived from it.

considered as an efficient way to reduce the traffic and the energy consumption
of the backhaul in emerging heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets). In this
paper, we consider a cluster-centric SCN with combined design of cooperative
caching and transmission policy. Small base stations (SBSs) are grouped into
disjoint clusters, in which in-cluster cache space is utilized as an entity. We
propose a combined caching scheme where part of the available cache space is
reserved for caching the most popular content in every SBS, while the remaining
is used for cooperatively caching different partitions of the less popular
content in different SBSs, as a means to increase local content diversity.
Depending on the availability and placement of the requested content,
coordinated multipoint (CoMP) technique with either joint transmission (JT) or
parallel transmission (PT) is used to deliver content to the served user. Using
Poisson point process (PPP) for the SBS location distribution and a hexagonal
grid model for the clusters, we provide analytical results on the successful
content delivery probability of both transmission schemes for a user located at
the cluster center. Our analysis shows an inherent tradeoff between
transmission diversity and content diversity in our combined
caching-transmission design. We also study optimal cache space assignment for
two objective functions: maximization of the cache service performance and the
energy efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves
performance gain by leveraging cache-level and signal-level cooperation and
adapting to the network environment and user QoS requirements.

of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) beyond cosmological studies, illustrating it
with examples from the DES early data. DES is using a wide-field camera (DECam)
on the 4m Blanco Telescope in Chile to image 5000 sq deg of the sky in five
filters (grizY). By its completion the survey is expected to have generated a
catalogue of 300 million galaxies with photometric redshifts and 100 million
stars. In addition, a time-domain survey search over 27 sq deg is expected to
yield a sample of thousands of Type Ia supernovae and other transients. The
main goals of DES are to characterise dark energy and dark matter, and to test
alternative models of gravity; these goals will be pursued by studying large
scale structure, cluster counts, weak gravitational lensing and Type Ia
supernovae. However, DES also provides a rich data set which allows us to study
many other aspects of astrophysics. In this paper we focus on additional
science with DES, emphasizing areas where the survey makes a difference with
respect to other current surveys. The paper illustrates, using early data (from
`Science Verification', and from the first, second and third seasons of
observations), what DES can tell us about the solar system, the Milky Way,
galaxy evolution, quasars, and other topics. In addition, we show that if the
cosmological model is assumed to be Lambda+ Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) then
important astrophysics can be deduced from the primary DES probes. Highlights
from DES early data include the discovery of 34 Trans Neptunian Objects, 17
dwarf satellites of the Milky Way, one published z > 6 quasar (and more
confirmed) and two published superluminous supernovae (and more confirmed).

noted that there are apparent differences in properties of radio-quiet and
radio-loud subsets. In particular, average observed radio-loud pulsar is
younger than radio-quiet one and is located at smaller galactic latitude. Even
so, the analysis based on the full list of pulsars may suffer from selection
effects. Namely, most of radio-loud pulsars are first discovered in the
radio-band, while radio-quiet ones are found using the gamma-ray data. In this
work we perform a blind search for gamma-ray pulsars using the Fermi LAT data
alone using all point sources from 3FGL catalog as the candidates. Unlike
preceding blind search, the present catalog is constructed with novel
semi-coherent method and covers the full range of characteristic ages down to 1
kyr. The search resulted in the catalog of 40 non-recycled pulsars, 26 of which
are radio-quiet. There are no statistically significant differences in age and
galactic latitude distributions for the radio-loud and radio-quiet pulsars,
while the rotation period distributions are marginally different with
$2.4\sigma$ pre-trial statistical significance. The fraction of radio-quiet
pulsars is estimated as $\epsilon_{RQ}=63\pm 8\%$. The results are in agreement
with the predictions of the outer magnitosphere models, while the Polar cap
models are disfavored.

observed activity is a challenge across many different disciplines. The
fundamental first step is to establish whether or to what extent the
interactions between the units can be considered pairwise and, thus, can be
modeled as an interaction network with simple links corresponding to pairwise
interactions. In principle this can be determined by comparing the maximum
entropy given the bivariate probability distributions to the true joint
entropy. In many practical cases this is not an option since the bivariate
distributions needed may not be reliably estimated, or the optimization is too
computationally expensive. Here we present an approach that allows one to use
mutual informations as a proxy for the bivariate distributions. This has the
advantage of being less computationally expensive and easier to estimate. We
achieve this by introducing a novel entropy maximization scheme that is based
on conditioning on entropies and mutual informations. This renders our approach
typically superior to other methods based on linear approximations. The
advantages of the proposed method are documented using oscillator networks and
a resting-state human brain network as generic relevant examples.

addition, we propose a nonparametric formulation of connected informations and
give an illustrative example showing how this agrees with the existing

of about 2.2x10^{14} G, a characteristic age of about 3.6kyr and, a spin-down
luminosity L_{sd} of about 1.7x10^{34} erg/s. The source spectrum is well
modelled by a blackbody with temperature of about 500eV plus a power-law
component with photon index of about 2. The source showed a moderate long-term
variability, with a flux decay of about 25\% during the first four months since
its discovery, and a re-brightening of the same amount during the second four
months. The X-ray data were also used to study the source environment. In
particular, we discovered a diffuse emission extending on spatial scales from
about 1"" up to at least 1' around SGR J1935+2154 both in Chandra and XMM-Newton
data. This component is constant in flux (at least within uncertainties) and
its spectrum is well modelled by a power-law spectrum steeper than that of the
pulsar. Though a scattering halo origin seems to be more probable we cannot
exclude that part, or all, of the diffuse emission is due to a pulsar wind
nebula.

  We performed the analysis based on phase-resolved, four Stokes parameter
spectropolarimetric observations obtained with the HARPSpol instrument. These

  We improved the atmospheric parameters of the star, T_eff = 9850K +/- 250K
and logg = 4.05 +/- 0.10. We performed detailed abundance analysis and
discovered vertical stratification effects for the FeII and CrII ions. We
computed LSD Stokes profiles and studied their behavior with rotational phase.
We improved the rotational period of the star P_rot = 9.29558(6)d. Magnetic
Doppler imaging of HD 125248 showed that its magnetic field is mostly poloidal
and quasi-dipolar with two large spots of different polarity and field
strength. The chemical maps of Fe, Cr, Ce, Nd, Gd, and Ti show abundance
contrasts of 0.9-3.5 dex. Among these elements, the Fe abundance map does not
show high-contrast features. Cr is overabundant around the negative magnetic
pole and has 3.5 dex abundance range. The rare earth elements and Ti are
overabundant near the positive magnetic pole.
  The magnetic field of HD 125248 has strong deviations from the classical
axisymmetric dipole field geometry. The comparison to results derived for other
stars using four Stokes magnetic Doppler imaging suggests evidence that the
field topology becomes simpler with increasing age. The abundance maps show
weak correlation with the magnetic field geometry, but they do not agree with
the atomic diffusion calculations.

equilibrium processes in the light of reality and investigate the energetic
""price of haste"", i.e. the consequences of carrying out a process in finite
time, when perfect equilibrium cannot be awaited due to economic reasons or the
nature of the process. Employing the formalism of geometric thermodynamics, a
lower bound on the energy dissipated during a process is derived from the
thermodynamic length of that process. The notion of length is hereby defined
via a metric structure on the space of equilibrium thermodynamics, spanned by a
set of thermodynamic variables describing the system. Since the aim of
finite-time thermodynamics is to obtain realistic limitations on idealized
scenarios, it is a useful tool to reassess the efficiency of thermodynamic
processes. We examine its implications for black hole thermodynamics, in
particular scenarios inspired by the Penrose process, a thought experiment by
which work can be extracted from a rotating black hole. We consider a Kerr
black hole which, by some mechanism, is losing mass and angular momentum.
Thermodynamically speaking, such a process is described in the equilibrium
phase space of the black hole, but in reality, it is neither reversible nor
infinitely slow. We thus calculate the dissipated energy due to non-ideal

algorithms attempt to recover spikes from observed imaging data, which are then
commonly subjected to the same analyses that are applied to
electrophysiologically recorded spikes (e.g., estimation of average firing
rates, or tuning curves). Here we show, however, that in the presence of noise
this approach is often heavily biased. We propose an alternative analysis that
aims to estimate the underlying rate directly, by integrating over the
unobserved spikes instead of committing to a single estimate of the spike
train. This approach can be used to estimate average firing rates or tuning
curves directly from the imaging data, and is sufficiently flexible to
incorporate prior knowledge about tuning structure. We show that directly
estimated rates are more accurate than those obtained from averaging of spikes

to completely classify exotic PT-invariant topological metals and to physically
realize them. Here we, for the first time, establish a rigorous classification
of topological metals that are protected by the PT symmetry using KO-theory. As
a physically realistic example, a PT-invariant nodal loop (NL) model in a 3D
Brillouin zone is constructed, whose topological stability is revealed through
its PT-symmetry-protected nontrivial Z2 topological charge. Based on these
exact results, we propose an experimental scheme to realize and to detect
tunable PT-invariant topological NL states with ultracold atoms in an optical
lattice, in which atoms with two hyperfine spin states are loaded in a
spin-dependent 3D OL and two pairs of Raman lasers are used to create
out-of-plane spin-flip hopping with site-dependent phase. Such a realistic
cold-atom setup can yield topological NL states, having a tunable ring-shaped
band-touching line with the two-fold degeneracy in the bulk spectrum and
non-trivial surface states. The states are actually protected by the combined
PT symmetry even in the absence of both P and T symmetries, and are
characterized by a Z2-type invariant (a quantized Berry phase). Remarkably, we
demonstrate with numerical simulations that (i) the characteristic NL can be
detected by measuring the atomic transfer fractions in a Bloch-Zener
oscillation; (ii) the topological invariant may be measured based on the
time-of-flight imaging; and (iii) the surface states may be probed through
Bragg spectroscopy. The present proposal for realizing topological NL states in
cold atom systems may provide a unique experimental platform for exploring
exotic PT-invariant topological physics.

harvested energy is prioritized to power information relaying while the
remainder is accumulated and stored for future usage with the help of a battery
in the proposed strategy, which supports an efficient utilization of harvested
energy. However, PS affects throughput at subsequent time slots due to the
battery operations including the charging and discharging. To this end, PS and
battery operations are coupled with distributed beamforming. A throughput
optimization problem to incorporate these coupled operations is formulated
though it is intractable. To address the intractability of the optimization,a
layered optimization method is proposed to achieve the optimal joint PS and
battery operation design with non-causal channel state information (CSI), in
which the PS and the battery operation can be analyzed in a decomposed manner.
Then, a general case with causal CSI is considered, where the proposed layered
optimization method is extended by utilizing the statistical properties of CSI.
To reach a better tradeoff between performance and complexity, a greedy method
that requires no information about subsequent time slots is proposed.
Simulation results reveal the upper and lower bound on performance of the
proposed strategy, which are reached by the layered optimization method with
non-causal CSI and the greedy method, respectively. Moreover, the proposed
strategy outperforms the conventional PS-based relaying without energy
accumulation and time switching-based relaying strategy.

dwarf satellites in Local Group galaxies and the resultant evolution of the

the mean surface density of a dark halo inside a radius at maximum circular
velocity V_max is universal over a large range of V_max. Following that this
surface density of 20 Msun/pc^2 well explains dwarf satellites in the Milky Way
and Andromeda, we find that the evolution of the dark halo in this common
surface-density scale is characterized by the rapid increase of the halo mass
assembled by the redshift z_TT of the tidal truncation by its host halo, at
early epochs of z_TT >~ 6 or V_max <~ 22 km/s. This mass growth of the halo is
slow at lower z_TT or larger V_max. Taking into account the baryon content in
this dark halo evolution, under the influence of the ionizing background
radiation, we find that the dwarf satellites are divided into roughly two
families: those with V_max <~ 22 km/s having high star formation efficiency and
those with larger V_max having less efficient star formation. This
semi-analytical model is in good agreement with the high-resolution numerical
simulation for galaxy formation and with the observed star formation histories
for Fornax and Leo~II. This suggests that the evolution of a dark halo plays a
key role in understanding star formation histories in dwarf satellites.

have been thought and made to address the fundamental problem of wave-particle

second beam splitter (BS2) in a controllable way, microscopic particles
(photons, electrons, etc.) transporting within the MZI can lie in the quantum
superposition of the wave and particle state as
\psi=a_w\psi_wave+a_p\psi_particle. Here we present an alternative
interpretation to these delayed-choice experiments. We notice that as all
composite devices of MZI including BS2 are purely classical, the inserting and
removing operation of BS2 imposes a time-modulated Hamiltonian
H_mod(t)=a(t)H_in+b(t)H_out, instead of a quantum superposition of H_in and
H_out as H=a_wH_in+b_pH_out, to act upon the incident wave function. Solution
of this quantum scattering problem, rather than the long held quantum
eigen-problem yields a synchronically time-modulated output wave function as
\psi_mod=a(t)\psi_wave+b(t)\psi_particle. As a result, the probability of
particle output from the MZI behaves as if they are in the superposition of the
wave and particle state when many events over time accumulation are counted and
averaged. We expect these elementary but insightful analyses will shed a new
light on exploring basic physics beyond the long-held wisdom of wave-particle
duality and principle of complementarity.

the critical layers of the associated normal-mode problem. The instability is
the result of a resonant interaction between a Rossby wave and a gravity wave
which we refer to as Z-modes. The associated critical layer is the location
where the Doppler shifted frequency of a distant Rossby wave equals the local
Brunt-Vaisala frequency. The minimum required Rossby number for instability,
Ro= 0.2, is confirmed for parameter values reported in the literature. It is
also found that the shear layer supports the instability in the limit where
stratification vanishes. The zombie vortex instability is examined in a jet

forcing due to unstable Z-modes is shown to result in the creation of a jet
flow at the critical layer emerging as the result of the competition between
the vertical lifting of perturbation radial vorticity and the radial transport
of perturbation vertical vorticity. We find that the picture of this
instability leading to a form of nonlinearly driven self-replicating pattern of
creation and destruction is warranted: a parent jet spawns a growing child jet
at associated critical layers. A mature child jet creates a next generation of
child jets at associated critical layers while simultaneously destroying its

as they induce complicated and confounding dependencies among a collection of
observed variables. Factor analysis is a prominent multivariate statistical
modeling approach that addresses this challenge by identifying the effects of
(a small number of) latent variables on a set of observed variables. However,
the latent variables in a factor model are purely mathematical objects that are
derived from the observed phenomena, and they do not have any interpretation
associated to them. A natural approach for attributing semantic information to
the latent variables in a factor model is to obtain measurements of some
additional plausibly useful covariates that may be related to the original set
of observed variables, and to associate these auxiliary covariates to the
latent variables. In this paper, we describe a systematic approach for
identifying such associations. Our method is based on solving computationally
tractable convex optimization problems, and it can be viewed as a
generalization of the minimum-trace factor analysis procedure for fitting
factor models via convex optimization. We analyze the theoretical consistency
of our approach in a high-dimensional setting as well as its utility in
practice via experimental demonstrations with real data.

integral functionals that is studied within the calculus of variations. Proofs
of the existence of minimizers usually rely on a fine property of the involved
functional called weak lower semicontinuity. While early studies of lower
semicontinuity go back to the beginning of the 20th century the milestones of
the modern theory were set by C.B. Morrey Jr. in 1952 and N.G. Meyers in 1965.
We recapitulate the development on this topic from then on. Special attention
is paid to signed integrands and to applications in continuum mechanics of
solids. In particular, we review the concept of polyconvexity and special
properties of (sub)determinants with respect to weak lower semicontinuity.
Besides, we emphasize some recent progress in lower semicontinuity of
functionals along sequences satisfying differential and algebraic constraints
which have applications in elasticity to ensure injectivity and
orientation-preservation of deformations. Finally, we outline generalization of
these results to more general first-order partial differential operators and
make some suggestions for further reading.

constrained by the availability of gas in the central star forming region, and
a competition between cooling and expansion. We show that the allowed range of
the mass loading factor can explain the observed scaling of $L_X$ with star

M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$, and a flatter relation at low SFRs. We also show that the

as a large scatter in the diffuse X-ray emission for low SFRs ($\lesssim$ few

repair problem when a device storing data leaves the cell. We introduce a
repair scheduling where repair is performed periodically and derive analytical
expressions for the overall communication cost of content download and data
repair as a function of the repair interval. The derived expressions are then
used to evaluate the communication cost entailed by DS using several erasure
correcting codes. Our results show that DS can reduce the communication cost
with respect to the case where content is downloaded only from the BS, provided
that repairs are performed frequently enough. If devices storing content arrive
to the cell, the communication cost using DS is further reduced and, for large
enough arrival rate, it is always beneficial. Interestingly, we show that MDS
codes, which do not perform well for classical DS, can yield a low overall
communication cost in wireless DS.

interest over the past centuries, especially in economics, psychology or social
choice theory, it has been revitalized in the past 15 years by recent
applications such as recommender or search engines and is receiving now
increasing interest in the machine learning literature. Numerous modern systems
indeed generate ranking data, representing for instance ordered results to a
query or user preferences. Each such ranking usually involves a small but
varying subset of the whole catalog of items only. The study of the variability
of these data, i.e. the statistical analysis of incomplete rank-ings, is
however a great statistical and computational challenge, because of their
heterogeneity and the related combinatorial complexity of the problem. Whereas
many statistical methods for analyzing full rankings (orderings of all the
items in the catalog) are documented in the dedicated literature, partial
rankings (full rankings with ties) or pairwise comparisons, only a few
approaches are available today to deal with incomplete ranking, relying each on
a strong specific assumption. It is the purpose of this article to introduce a
novel general framework for the statistical analysis of incomplete rankings. It
is based on a representation tailored to these specific data, whose
construction is also explained here, which fits with the natural multi-scale
structure of incomplete rankings and provides a new decomposition of rank
information with a multiresolu-tion analysis interpretation (MRA). We show that
the MRA representation naturally allows to overcome both the statistical and
computational challenges without any structural assumption on the data. It
therefore provides a general and flexible framework to solve a wide variety of
statistical problems, where data are of the form of incomplete rankings.

representations, and then we apply multi-task learning on the features to
predict their attributes. In our multi-task framework, we propose a method to
decompose the overall model's parameters into a latent task matrix and
combination matrix. Furthermore, under-sampled classifiers can leverage shared
statistics from other classifiers to improve their performance. Natural
grouping of attributes is applied such that attributes in the same group are
encouraged to share more knowledge. Meanwhile, attributes in different groups

the Large Hadron Collider, is reported. Such a Higgs boson could exist in
extensions of the standard model with two Higgs doublets, and could be produced
via $p\bar{p} \to H^\pm h_f \to W^* h_f h_f \to 4\gamma + X$, where $H^\pm$ is
a charged Higgs boson. This analysis uses all events with at least three
photons in the final state from proton-antiproton collisions at a
center-of-mass energy of 1.96~TeV collected by the Collider Detector at
Fermilab, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9.2~${\rm fb}^{-1}$. No
evidence of a signal is observed in the data. Values of Higgs-boson masses
between 10 and 100 GeV/$c^2$ are excluded at 95\% Bayesian credibility.

fixed-points of monotone polynomials on Heyting algebras-that is, the algebraic
models of the Intuitionistic Propositional Calculus-always exist, even when
these algebras are not complete as lattices. The reason is that these extremal
fixed-points are definable by formulas of the IPC. Consequently, the
$\mu$-calculus based on intuitionistic logic is trivial, every $\mu$-formula
being equivalent to a fixed-point free formula. We give in this paper an
axiomatization of least and greatest fixed-points of formulas, and an algorithm
to compute a fixed-point free formula equivalent to a given $\mu$-formula. The
axiomatization of the greatest fixed-point is simple. The axiomatization of the
least fixed-point is more complex, in particular every monotone formula
converges to its least fixed-point by Kleene's iteration in a finite number of
steps, but there is no uniform upper bound on the number of iterations. We
extract, out of the algorithm, upper bounds for such n, depending on the size
of the formula. For some formulas, we show that these upper bounds are
polynomial and optimal.

in the 1/3-filled second Landau level (SLL) at filling factor $\nu=7/3$ (and
8/3 in the presence of the particle-hole symmetry) via exact diagonalization in
both torus and spherical geometries. Specifically, we compute the overlap
between the exact 7/3 ground state and various competing states including (i)
the Laughlin state, (ii) the fermionic Haffnian state, (iii) the
antisymmetrized product state of two composite fermion seas at 1/6 filling, and
(iv) the particle-hole (PH) conjugate of the $Z_4$ parafermion state. All these
trial states are constructed according to a guiding principle called the
bilayer mapping approach, where a trial state is obtained as the
antisymmetrized projection of a bilayer quantum Hall state with interlayer
distance $d$ as a variational parameter. Under the proper understanding of the
ground-state degeneracy in the torus geometry, the $Z_4$ parafermion state can
be obtained as the antisymmetrized projection of the Halperin (330) state.
Similarly, it is proved in this work that the fermionic Haffnian state can be
obtained as the antisymmetrized projection of the Halperin (551) state. It is
shown that, while extremely accurate at sufficiently large positive Haldane
pseudopotential variation $\delta V_1^{(1)}$, the Laughlin state loses its
overlap with the exact 7/3 ground state significantly at $\delta V_1^{(1)}
\simeq 0$. At slightly negative $\delta V_1^{(1)}$, it is shown that the
PH-conjugated $Z_4$ parafermion state has a substantial overlap with the exact
7/3 ground state, which is the highest among the above four trial states.

later re-examined in a companion paper (Pujol et al. 2016) with rigorous
simulation tests and analytical treatment of tomographic measurements. In this

photometric redshift bins to be 1.12$\pm$0.19 (z=0.2-0.4), 0.97$\pm$0.15

measurements are consistent at the 2$\sigma$ level with measurements on the
same dataset using galaxy clustering and cross-correlation of galaxies with CMB
lensing, with most of the redshift bins consistent within the 1{\sigma} error
bars. In addition, our method provides the only $\sigma_8$-independent
constraint among the three. We forward-model the main observational effects
using mock galaxy catalogs by including shape noise, photo-z errors and masking
effects. We show that our bias measurement from the data is consistent with
that expected from simulations. With the forthcoming full DES data set, we
expect this method to provide additional constraints on the galaxy bias
measurement from more traditional methods. Furthermore, in the process of our
measurement, we build up a 3D mass map that allows further exploration of the
dark matter distribution and its relation to galaxy evolution.

factor F_W(s) that parametrizes this decay is unambiguous in four dimensions.
When it is used to calculate the unsubtracted dispersion integral, the finite
result for the form factor F_W(s) is obtained. However, the F_W(s) obtained in
this way differs by a constant term from the result of a diagrammatic
computation, based on dimensional regularization. It is easy to accommodate the
missing constant by writing a once-subtracted dispersion relation for F_W(s)
but it is unclear why the subtraction needs to be done. The goal of this paper
is to investigate this question in detail. We show that the correct constant
can be recovered within a dispersive approach in a number of ways that,
however, either require an introduction of an ultraviolet regulator or
unphysical degrees of freedom; unregulated and unsubtracted computations in the
unitary gauge are insufficient, in spite of the fact that such computations

amplitude modulation (OQAM), namely, FBMC-OQAM, have been criticized for their
inefficiency in the use of spectral resources, because of the long ramp-up and
ramp-down tails at the beginning and the end of each data packet, respectively.
We propose a novel method for shortening these tails. By appending a set of
virtual (i.e., none data carrying) symbols to the beginning and the end of each
packet, and clever selection of these symbols, we show that the ramp-up and
rampdown tails in FMBC-OQAM can be suppressed to an extent that they deem as
negligible and thus may be ignored. This shortens the length of signal burst in
each FBMC-OQAM packet, hence, improves on its bandwidth efficiency, viz., the
same data is transmitted over a shorter period of time. We develop an
optimization method that allows computation of virtual symbols, for each data

proposed tail-shortening approach leads to a superior out-of-band (OOB)

thermomechanical system of partial differential equations (PDE) using the
recent approach based on elliptic regularity theory. We give an extended and
improved definition of the set of admissible shapes based on a class of
sufficiently differentiable deformation maps applied to a baseline shape. The
obtained set of admissible shapes again allows one to prove a uniform Schauder
estimate for the elasticity PDE. In order to deal with thermal stress, a
related uniform Schauder estimate is also given for the heat equation. Special
emphasis is put on Robin boundary conditions, which are motivated from
convective heat transfer. It is shown that these thermal Schauder estimates can
serve as an input to the Schauder estimates for the elasticity equation. This
is needed to prove the compactness of the (suitably extended) solutions of the
entire PDE system in some state space that carries a c2-H\""older topology for
the temperature field and a C3-H\""older topology for the displacement. From
this one obtains he property of graph compactness, which is the essential tool
in an proof of the existence of optimal shapes. Due to the topologies employed,
the method works for objective functionals that depend on the displacement and
its derivatives up to third order and on the temperature field and its
derivatives up to second order. This general result in shape optimization is
then applied to the problem of optimal reliability, i.e. the problem of finding
shapes that have minimal failure probability under cyclic thermomechanical
loading.

collections of $d+2(k-\lambda)$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with
$k-\lambda\geqslant 2$ and $\lambda =2,3$. We then present a description of

either $L$ is a complete Kneser transversal or it contains $d-2(\lambda-1)$

such a way that $L$ intersects the corresponding closed segments determined by

track the plasmon resonance modeled by a Lorentzian oscillator. Our
experimental device is based on a spectrometer optically coupled to an atomic

a strong optical coupling between the tip and the surface. We demonstrate that
this coupling strongly affects the luminescence (Intensity, wavelength and

parameters is directly related to the plasmonic properties of the gold surface
and is used to qualify the optical near field enhancement (which subsequently
plays the predominant role in surface enhanced spectroscopies) with a very high

showing that contrary to some recent suggestions, side chains alone are not
sufficient to insure a protein-like structure. Finally, we show that a

difference between dipoles, but also by placing the z-polarized dipole to its
image position, whereas the handedness of the background field remains the
same. The unidirectional excitation of GPs can be extended directly into arc
graphene surface as well. Furthermore, our proposal on directional generation
of GPs can be realized in a semiconductor nanowire/graphene system, where a
semiconductor nanowire can mimic the circularly polarized dipole when
illuminated by two orthogonally polarized plane waves.

can be used to identify and estimate the causal effect of a treatment using

assignment, whereby a subject is assigned to the treatment (control) group
whenever their observed value of a specific continuous variable is greater than

sharp and fuzzy RDDs. We use the language and calculus of conditional
independence to express and explore in a clear and precise manner the
conditions implied by each RDD and investigate additional assumptions under

recently shown to outperform traditional proper Gaussian signaling (PGS) in
several interference-limited channel settings. In this work, IGS is employed in
an attempt to alleviate the RSI adverse effect in full-duplex relaying (FDR).
To this end, we derive a tight upper bound expression for the end-to-end outage
probability in terms of the relay signal parameters represented in its power
and circularity coefficient. We further show that the derived upper bound is
either monotonic or unimodal in the relay's circularity coefficient. This
result allows for easily locating the global optimal point using known
numerical methods. Based on the analysis, IGS allows FDR systems to operate
even with high RSI. It is shown that, while the communication totally fails
with PGS as the RSI increases, the IGS outage probability approaches a fixed
value that depends on the channel statistics and target rate. The obtained
results show that IGS can leverage higher relay power budgets than PGS to
improve the performance, meanwhile it relieves its RSI impact via tuning the

of quantum superposition compete with classical dynamics of optical pumping and

with coherent superposition developing subsequently or is it the other way
round: coherently superposed atoms driven to steady state via optical pumping?
Using a stroboscopic probing technique, here we experimentally explore these
questions. A 100 ns pulse is used to probe an experimentally simulated, closed
three-level, lambda-like configuration in rubidium atoms, driven by strong
coherent control and incoherent fields. Temporal evolution of probe
transmission shows an initial overshoot with turn-on of control, resulting in a
scenario akin to lasing without inversion (LWI). The corresponding rise time is
dictated by coherent dynamics, with a distinct experimental signature of
half-cycle Rabi flop in a thermal ensemble of atoms. Our results indicate that,
in fact, optical pumping drives the atoms to a steady state in a significantly
longer time-scale that sustains superposed dark states. Eventual control
turn-off leads to a sudden fall in transmission with an ubiquitous signature
for identifying closed and open systems. Numerical simulations and toy-model
predictions confirm our claims. These studies reveal new insights into a rich
and complex dynamics associated with atoms in thermal ensemble, which are
otherwise absent in state-prepared, cold atomic ensembles.

families, e.g., RNA sequence counts from a negative binomial distribution.
These violate additivity. Yet, designs generated by assuming additivity
continue to be used, because better approaches are not available, and because
the issues are not widely recognised. We solve this problem for single-factor
experiments in which treatments, taking categorical values only, are arranged
in blocks and responses drawn from a Poisson distribution. We derive
expressions for two objective functions, based on D_A- and C-optimality, with
efficient estimation of linear contrasts of the fixed effects parameters in a
Poisson generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) being the objective. These
objective functions are shown to be computational efficient, requiring no
matrix inversion. Using simulated annealing to generate Poisson GLMM-based
locally optimal designs, we show that the replication numbers of treatments in

time-inconsistent agents to complete long term projects. We resort to an
elegant graph-theoretic model, introduced by Kleinberg and Oren, which consists
of a task graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, including a source $s$ and target $t$,
and an agent that incrementally constructs a path from $s$ to $t$ in order to
collect rewards. The twist is that the agent is present-biased and discounts
future costs and rewards by a factor $\beta\in [0,1]$. Our design objective is
to ensure that the agent reaches $t$ i.e.\ completes the project, for as little
reward as possible. Such graphs are called motivating. We consider two
strategies. First, we place a single reward $r$ at $t$ and try to guide the
agent by removing edges from $G$. We prove that deciding the existence of such
motivating subgraphs is NP-complete if $r$ is fixed. More importantly, we
generalize our reduction to a hardness of approximation result for computing
the minimum $r$ that admits a motivating subgraph. In particular, we show that
no polynomial-time approximation to within a ratio of $\sqrt{n}/4$ or less is
possible, unless ${\rm P}={\rm NP}$. Furthermore, we develop a
$(1+\sqrt{n})$-approximation algorithm and thus settle the approximability of
computing motivating subgraphs. Secondly, we study motivating reward
configurations, where non-negative rewards $r(v)$ may be placed on arbitrary
vertices $v$ of $G$. The agent only receives the rewards of visited vertices.
Again we give an NP-completeness result for deciding the existence of a
motivating reward configuration within a fixed budget $b$. This result even
holds if $b=0$, which in turn implies that no efficient approximation of a
minimum $b$ within a ration grater or equal to $1$ is possible, unless ${\rm
P}={\rm NP}$.

hypothesize, first, that previous approaches have not worked because they have
been direct -- they have tried to explicitly connect people with those having
opposing views on sensitive issues. Second, that neither recommendation or
presentation of information by themselves are enough to encourage behavioral
change. We propose a platform that mixes a recommender algorithm and a
visualization-based user interface to explore recommendations. It recommends
politically diverse profiles in terms of distance of latent topics, and
displays those recommendations in a visual representation of each user's
personal content. We performed an ""in the wild"" evaluation of this platform,
and found that people explored more recommendations when using a biased
algorithm instead of ours. In line with our hypothesis, we also found that the
mixture of our recommender algorithm and our user interface, allowed
politically interested users to exhibit an unbiased exploration of the

first, which individual differences are important when designing platforms

functor, namely a functor * that maps any set A to the set *A of its
non-standard elements. That functor, from the category of sets to itself, is
postulated to be an equivalence on the full subcategory of finite sets onto
itself and to preserve finite projective limits (equivalently, to preserve
finite products and equalizers). Secondly, ""Local"" non-standard analysis is
introduced as a structure which I call lim-rim, in particular exact lim-rims.
The interplay between these, and ultrafilters and ultrapowers, and also
cardinality relations and notions depending on a cardinality such as saturation
and what I call ""confinement"" and ""exactness"", are investigated.
  In particular, one constructs non-standard analyses, with ""good"" kinds of
lim-rims. In these one may say that *A - ""the adjunction of all possible limits
from A"" - plays a role analogous to that of the algebraic closure of a field -
""the adjunction of all roots of polynomials"". Then in the same spirit as with
the latter, one has uniqueness up to isomorphism, and also universality and
homogeneity, provided one has enough General Continuum Hypothesis. The
cardinality of *A will be something like $2^{2^{|A|}}$, and one has a high
degree of saturation.
  Also, one notes that the functor * can be applied again to *A, giving **A,
***A, and so forth. In particular, I focus on the two different embeddings of
*A into **A and prove some of their properties, with some applications.

observed the expected characteristics of an SEP event at a well-connected
position, STEREO B detected a very anisotropic bi-directional distribution of
near-relativistic electrons and was situated inside a magnetic-cloud-like
structure during the early phase of the event. We examine the source of the
bi-directional SEP distribution at STEREO B. On the one hand this distribution
could be caused by a double injection into both loop legs of the MC. On the
other hand, a mirroring scenario where the incident beam is reflected in the
opposite loop leg could be the reason. Furthermore, the energetic electron
observations are used to probe the magnetic structure inside the magnetic
cloud. We show that STEREO B was embedded in an MC-like structure ejected three
days earlier. We apply a GCS model to the coronagraph observations from three
viewpoints as well as the Global Magnetic Cloud model to the in situ
measurements at STEREO B to determine the orientation and topology of the MC
close to the Sun and at 1 AU. We also estimate the path lengths of the
electrons propagating through the MC to estimate the amount of magnetic field
line winding inside the structure. The relative intensity and timing of the
energetic electron increases in the different SEPT telescopes at STEREO B
strongly suggest that the bi-directional electron distribution is formed by SEP
injections in both loop legs of the MC separately instead of by mirroring
farther away beyond the STEREO orbit. Observations by the Nancay
Radioheliograph of two distinct radio sources during the SEP injection further
support the above scenario.

band structures, which meet three basic requirements: the existence of
metastable excited states sufficiently protected from collisional band
relaxation, a mechanism to excite the atoms initially prepared in the lowest
band with moderate entropy increase, and the possibility of cross-dimensional
tunneling dynamics, necessary to establish coherence along all lattice axes. A
variety of bands can be selectively populated and a subsequent thermalisation
process leads to the formation of a condensate in the lowest energy state of
the chosen band. As examples the 2nd, 4th and 7th bands in a bipartite square
lattice are discussed. In the 2nd and 7th band, the band geometry can be tuned
such that two inequivalent energetically degenerate energy minima arise at the
$X_{\pm}$-points at the edge of the 1st Brillouin zone. In this case even a
small interaction energy is sufficient to lock the phase between the two
condensation points such that a complex-valued chiral superfluid order
parameter can emerge, which breaks time reversal symmetry. In the 4th band a
condensate can be formed in the $\Gamma$-point in the center of the 1st
Brillouin zone, which can be used to explore topologically protected band
touching points. The new techniques to access orbital degrees of freedom in
higher bands greatly extend the class of many-body scenarios that can be
explored with bosons in optical lattices.

II~Zw~177 using a $137\ks$ long and another $13\ks$ short \xmm{} observation

excess emission contributing $76.9\pm4.9\%$ in 2012 and $58.8\pm10.2\%$ in 2001
in the $0.3-2\kev$ band. We find that both blurred reflection from an ionized
disc and Comptonized disc emission describe the observed soft excess well.
Time-resolved spectroscopy on scales of $\sim20\ks$ reveals strong correlation
between the soft excess and the powerlaw components. The fractional variability
amplitude $F_{var}$ derived from EPIC-pn lightcurves at different energy bands
is nearly constant ($F_{var} \sim20\%$). This is in contrast to other AGNs
where the lack of short term variation in soft X-ray excess emission has been
attributed to intense light bending in the framework of the ""lamppost"" model.
Thus, the variations in powerlaw emission are most likely intrinsic to corona
rather than just due to the changes of height of compact corona. The variable
UV emission ($F_{var} \sim 1\%$) is uncorrelated to any of the X-ray components
on short timescales suggesting that the UV emission is not dominated by the
reprocessed emission. The gradual observed decline in the UV emission in 2012
may be related to the secular decline due to the changes in the accretion rate.
In this case, the short term X-ray variability is not due to the changes in the
seed photons but intrinsic to the hot corona.

re-analyze this object. We analyzed Gemini archival data from the Near-Infrared
Coronagraphic Imager (NICI) obtained in 2011 in the H band, using several
angular differential imaging techniques (classical ADI, LOCI, KLIP). These
images reveal the complex structures of this disk with an unprecedented
resolution. We also include archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images as an
independent dataset to confirm these findings. Using an analysis of the inner
edge of the disk, we show that the inner disk is almost axisymmetrical. The
measurement of an offset towards the East observed by previous authors is
likely due to the fact that the Eastern part of this disk is wider and more
complex in substructure. Our precise re-analysis of the eastern side shows
several structures including a splitting of the disk and a small finger
detached from the inner edge on the southeast. Finally, we find that the arc at
250 AU is unlikely to be a spiral, at least not at the inclination derived from
the first ring, but instead could be interpreted as a third belt at a different

site can be either empty or singly occupied by one of $M$ different particles,
all species having the same fugacity $z$. The only nonzero interaction
potential is a nearest-neighbor hard-core exclusion between unlike particles.
For $M<M_0$ with some minimum $M_0$ dependent on the lattice structure, as $z$
increases from 0 to $\infty$ there is a direct transition from the disordered
(gas) phase to a demixed (liquid) phase with one majority component at
$z>z_d(M)$. If $M\ge M_0$, there is an intermediate ordered ""crystal phase""
(composed of two nonequivalent even and odd sublattices) for $z$ lying between
$z_c(M)$ and $z_d(M)$ which is driven by entropy. We generalize the
multicomponent WR model by replacing the hard-core exclusion between unlike
particles by more realistic large (but finite) repulsion. The model is solved
exactly on the Bethe lattice with an arbitrary coordination number. The
numerical calculations, based on the corner transfer matrix renormalization
group, are performed for the two-dimensional square lattice. The results for
$M=4$ indicate that the second-order phase transitions from the disordered gas
to the demixed phase become of first order, for an arbitrarily large finite
repulsion. The results for $M\ge M_0$ show that, as the repulsion weakens, the
region of crystal phase diminishes itself. For weak enough repulsions, the
direct transition between the crystal and demixed phases changes into a
separate pair of crystal-gas and gas-demixed transitions; this is an example of
a disorder-disorder reentrant transition via an ordered crystal phase. If the
repulsion between unlike species is too weak, the crystal phase disappears from
the phase diagram. It is shown that the generalized WR model belongs to the
Ising universality class.

their parent galaxies. Gas hydrodynamical effects can additionally strip gas
and dust from galaxies. The properties of the ICL can therefore help constrain
the physical processes at work in clusters by serving as a fossil record of the
interaction history. The present study is designed to characterise this ICL in
a ~10^14 M_odot and z~0.53 cluster of galaxies from imaging and spectroscopic
points of view. By applying a wavelet-based method to CFHT Megacam and WIRCAM
images, we detect significant quantities of diffuse light. These sources were
then spectroscopically characterised with MUSE. MUSE data were also used to
compute redshifts of 24 cluster galaxies and search for cluster substructures.
An atypically large amount of ICL has been detected in this cluster. Part of
the detected diffuse light has a very weak optical stellar component and
apparently consists mainly of gas emission, while other diffuse light sources
are clearly dominated by old stars. Furthermore, emission lines were detected
in several places of diffuse light. Our spectral analysis shows that this
emission likely originates from low-excitation parameter gas. The stellar
contribution to the ICL is about 2.3x10^9 yrs old even though the ICL is not
currently forming a large number of stars. On the other hand, the contribution
of the gas emission to the ICL in the optical is much greater than the stellar
contribution in some regions, but the gas density is likely too low to form
stars. These observations favour ram pressure stripping, turbulent viscous
stripping, or supernovae winds as the origin of the large amount of
intracluster light. Since the cluster appears not to be in a major merging
phase, we conclude that ram pressure stripping is the most plausible process
that generates the observed ICL sources.

has shown that flow separation in the diverging flow direction counteracts the
time-averaged pressure drop. In this work, the characteristics of flow
separation in jet pumps are identified and coupled with the observed jet pump
performance. Furthermore, it is shown that the onset of flow separation can be
shifted to larger displacement amplitudes by designs that have a smoother
transition between the small opening and the tapered surface of the jet pump.
These design alterations also reduce the duration of separated flow, resulting
in more effective and robust jet pumps. To make the proposed jet pump designs
more compact without reducing their performance, the minimum big opening radius
that can be implemented before the local minor losses have an influence on the
jet pump performance is investigated. To validate the numerical results, they
are compared with experimental results for one of the proposed jet pump

ansatz for the electromagnetic waves based on a single multimode coherent state
wavefunction; formally, this approach combines ideas from adiabatic
renormalization, the Born-Markov approximation, and input-output theory.
Second, we present numerically exact results for scattering of a weak intensity
pulse by using NRG calculations. NRG provides a benchmark for any linear
response property throughout the ultra-strong coupling regime. We find that in
a sudden quantum quench, the coherent state approach produces physical
artifacts, such as improper relaxation to the steady state. These previously
unnoticed problems are related to the simplified form of the ansatz that
generates spurious correlations within the bath. In the scattering problem, NRG
is used to find the transmission and reflection of a single photon, as well as
the inelastic scattering of that single photon. Simple analytical formulas are
established and tested against the NRG data that predict quantitatively the
transport coefficients for up to moderate environmental impedance. These
formulas resolve pending issues regarding the presence of inelastic losses in
the spin-boson model near absorption resonances, and could be used for
comparison to experiments in Josephson waveguide QED. Finally, the scattering
results using the coherent state wavefunction approach are compared favorably

a summary of the two-dimensional fields of the fundamental turbulence

field depends strongly on AR only within the canyon, while the outer flow seems
to be less sensitive to this parameter. This is not true for the vertical
momentum flux, which is one of the parameters most affected by AR, both within

skimming flow regime), the roughness sub-layer extends up to a height equal to
1.25 times the height of the obstacles (H), surmounted by an inertial sub-layer
that extends up to 2.7 H. In contrast, for (i.e. the wake-interference regime)
the inertial sub-layer is not present. This has significant implications when
using similarity laws for deriving wind and turbulence profiles in canopy

we propose an efficient algorithm termed approximate message passing with
nearest neighbor sparsity pattern learning (AMP-NNSPL), which learns the

typical intrinsic dust reddening. We used the method of Kohonen self-organising

spectra archive. We constructed a sample of 23 quasars classified as 3000 A
break quasars and two comparison samples of quasars with similar properties, to
some extent, but also showing typical BAL features. We computed
ensemble-averaged broad-band SEDs based on archival data from SDSS, GALEX,
2MASS, UKIDSS, and WISE. The SEDs were corrected for intrinsic dust absorption
by the comparison with the average SED of normal quasars. The de-reddened
arithmetic median composite SED of the 3000 A break quasars is found to be
indistinguishable from that of the unusual BAL quasars. We conclude that 3000 A
break quasars are most likely extreme versions of BAL quasars. Assuming that
the intrinsic SED of the continuum source is represented by the quasar
composite SED, the 3000 A break quasars tend to be intrinsically more luminous

have been largely constrained by synchrotron emission and Faraday rotation
measures. We use three different but representative models to compare their
predicted polarized synchrotron and dust emission with that measured by the
Planck satellite. We first update these models to match the Planck synchrotron
products using a common model for the cosmic-ray leptons. We discuss the impact
on this analysis of the ongoing problems of component separation in the Planck
microwave bands and of the uncertain cosmic-ray spectrum. In particular, the
inferred degree of ordering in the magnetic fields is sensitive to these
systematic uncertainties, and we further show the importance of considering the
expected variations in the observables in addition to their mean morphology. We
then compare the resulting simulated emission to the observed dust polarization
and find that the dust predictions do not match the morphology in the Planck
data but underpredict the dust polarization away from the plane. We modify one
of the models to roughly match both observables at high latitudes by increasing
the field ordering in the thin disc near the observer. Though this specific
analysis is dependent on the component separation issues, we present the
improved model as a proof of concept for how these studies can be advanced in
future using complementary information from ongoing and planned observational
projects.

Hojman's method for regular Hamiltonian systems, where the Hamiltonian function

application of Noether's Theorem for generalized transformations. That means
that for minimally-coupled scalar field cosmology or other modified theories
which are conformally related with scalar-field cosmology, like $f(R)$ gravity,
the application of Hojman's method provide us with the same results with that
of Noether's theorem. Moreover we study the special Ansatz. $\phi\left(

a minimally-coupled scalar field, and we study the Lie and Noether point
symmetries for the reduced equation. We show that under this Ansatz, the
unknown function of the model cannot be constrained by the requirement of the
existence of a conservation law and that the Hojman conservation quantity which
arises for the reduced equation is nothing more than the functional form of
Noetherian conservation laws for the free particle. On the other hand, for
$f(T)$ teleparallel gravity, it is not the existence of Hojman's conservation
laws which provide us with the special function form of $f(T)$ functions, but
the requirement that the reduced second-order differential equation admits a
Jacobi Last multiplier, while the new conservation law is nothing else that the
Hamiltonian function of the reduced equation.

The interior equilibrium is considered as the most important equilibrium state
of this model. The model equations are solved both analytically and numerically
using the real data base of Hooghly-Matla estuarine system. The essential
mathematical features of the present model have been analyzed thorough local
and global stability and the bifurcations arising in some selected situations.
A combination of set of values of the salinity of the estuary are identified

ranges of salinity under which the system undergoes Hopf bifurcation are

type-V cosmological model within the framework of self interacting Brans Dicke
theory of gravity in the background of anisotropic dark energy (DE) with
variable equation of state (EoS) parameter and constant deceleration parameter.
Constant deceleration parameter leads to two models of universe, i.e. power law
model and exponential model. EoS parameter {\omega} and its existing range for
the models is in good agreement with the most recent observational data. We
notice that {\omega} given by (37) i.e {\omega}(t) = log(k1t) is more suitable
in explaining the evolution of the universe. The physical behaviors of the
solutions have also been discussed using some physical quantities. Finally, we
observe that despite having several prominent features, both of the DE models
discussed fail in details.

  Constant Kozeny coefficient","23 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables",,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This study addresses the issue of whether or not a normal distribution
appropriately represents permeability variations. To do so, (i) the
distribution of local fibre volume fraction for each tow is experimentaly
determined by estimation of each pair of local areal density and thickness,
(ii) the Kozeny-Carmen equation together with the change of variable technique
are used to compute the PDF of permeability, (iii) using the local values of
fibre volume fraction, the distribution of local average permeability is
computed and subsequently the goodness of fit of the computed PDF is compared
with the distribution of the permeability at microscale level. Finally
variability of local permeability at the microscale level is determined. The
first set of results reveals that (1) the relationship between the local areal
density and local thickness in a woven carbon-epoxy composite is modelled by a
bivariate normal distribution, (2) while fibre volume fraction follows a normal
distribution, permeability follows a gamma distribution, (3) this work also
shows that there is significant agreement between the analytical approach and
the simulation results. The second set of results shows that the coefficient of
variation of permeability is one order of magnitude larger than that of fibre
volume fraction. Future work will consider other variables, such as type of
fabrics, the degree of fibre preform compaction to determine whether or not the
bivariate normal model is applicable for a broad range of fabrics.

  Quantum Chemical Wavefunction Data",,,"10.1002/jcc.24358",,"physics.chem-ph physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  ORBKIT is a toolbox for post-processing electronic structure calculations
based on a highly modular and portable Python architecture. The program allows
computing a multitude of electronic properties of molecular systems on
arbitrary spatial grids from the basis set representation of its electronic
wavefunction, as well as several grid-independent properties. The required data
can be extracted directly from the standard output of a large number of quantum
chemical programs. ORBKIT can be used as a standalone program to determine
standard quantities, for example, the electron density, molecular orbitals, and
derivatives thereof. The cornerstone of ORBKIT is its modular structure. The
existing basic functions can be arranged in an individual way and can be easily
extended by user-written modules to determine any other desired quantities.
ORBKIT offers multiple output formats that can be processed by common
visualization tools (VMD, Molden, etc.). Additionally, ORBKIT possesses
routines to order molecular orbitals computed at different nuclear
configurations according to their electronic character and to interpolate the
wavefunction between these configurations. The program is open-source under
GNU-LGPLv3 license and freely available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/orbkit/. This article provides an overview of
ORBKIT with particular focus on its capabilities and applicability, and
includes several example calculations.
