symmetry, but the symmetry is often ""hidden"". The symmetry generators of 2nd
order superintegrable systems in 2 dimensions close under commutation to define
quadratic algebras, a generalization of Lie algebras. Distinct systems on
constant curvature spaces are related by geometric limits, induced by
generalized In\""on\""u-Wigner Lie algebra contractions of the symmetry algebras
of the underlying spaces. These have physical/geometric implications, such as
the Askey scheme for hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials. However, the limits
have no satisfactory Lie algebra contraction interpretations for underlying
spaces with 1- or 0-dimensional Lie algebras. We show that these systems can be
best understood by transforming them to Laplace conformally superintegrable
systems, with flat space conformal symmetry group ${\rm SO}(4,{\mathbb C})$,
and using ideas introduced in the 1894 thesis of B\^ocher to study separable
solutions of the wave equation in terms of roots of quadratic forms. We show
that B\^ocher's prescription for coalescing roots of these forms induces
contractions of the conformal algebra $\mathfrak{so}(4,{\mathbb C})$ to itself
and yields a mechanism for classifying all Helmholtz superintegrable systems
and their limits. In the paper [Acta Polytechnica, to appear,

to state-space models. This approach provides estimators which are (i)
consistent and asymptotically normally distributed, (ii) applicable to various
classes of time series models, (iii) straightforward to implement and (iv)
computationally efficient. The framework is based on the recently developed
Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments (GMWM) and a new robust estimator of the
wavelet variance. Compared to existing methods, the latter directly estimates
the quantity of interest while performing better in finite samples and using
milder conditions for its asymptotic properties to hold. Moreover, results are
given showing the identifiability of the GMWM for various classes of time
series models thereby allowing this method to consistently estimate many models
(and combinations thereof) under mild conditions. Hence, not only does this
paper provide an alternative estimator which allows to perform wavelet variance
analysis when data are contaminated but also a general approach to robustly
estimate the parameters of a variety of (latent) time series models. The
simulation studies carried out confirm the better performance of the proposed
estimators and the usefulness and broadness of the proposed methodology is
shown using practical examples from the domains of economics and engineering

Firstly, we propose stochastic natural gradient expectation propagation (SNEP),
a novel alternative to expectation propagation (EP), a popular variational
inference algorithm. SNEP is a black box variational algorithm, in that it does
not require any simplifying assumptions on the distribution of interest, beyond
the existence of some Monte Carlo sampler for estimating the moments of the EP
tilted distributions. Further, as opposed to EP which has no guarantee of
convergence, SNEP can be shown to be convergent, even when using Monte Carlo
moment estimates. Secondly, we propose a novel architecture for distributed
Bayesian learning which we call the posterior server. The posterior server
allows scalable and robust Bayesian learning in cases where a data set is
stored in a distributed manner across a cluster, with each compute node
containing a disjoint subset of data. An independent Monte Carlo sampler is run
on each compute node, with direct access only to the local data subset, but
which targets an approximation to the global posterior distribution given all
data across the whole cluster. This is achieved by using a distributed
asynchronous implementation of SNEP to pass messages across the cluster. We
demonstrate SNEP and the posterior server on distributed Bayesian learning of
logistic regression and neural networks.

transition in heavy-ion collisions? Are there two phase transition regions? If

indicator in optical spectra to distinguish different kinds of excitons, but
this is not possible in low-dimensional materials, where the binding energy is
large and comparable in size for excitons of very different localization. Here
we demonstrate that the exciton band structure, which can be accessed
experimentally, instead provides a powerful way to identify the exciton
character. By comparing the ab initio solution of the many-body Bethe-Salpeter
equation for graphane and single-layer hexagonal BN, we draw a general picture

to a zero-sum game. Linear programming duality and the max-flow min-cut theorem
are applied to obtain properties that are satisfied in any mixed Nash

the defender's expected transportation cost decreases in attacker's marginal
value of lost flow, the attacker's expected cost of attack increases in

$0.156\%\pm 0.009\%$ and $0.190\%\pm 0.006\%$, which are well-described by a

atmosphere with no dayside thermal inversion and moderately efficient day-night

presence of a superrotating equatorial jet. In contrast, HAT-P-7b's dayside
emission suggests a dayside thermal inversion and relatively inefficient
day-night circulation; no hotspot shift is detected. For both planets, these
same models do not agree with the measured nightside emission. The
discrepancies in the model-data comparisons for WASP-19b might be explained by
high-altitude silicate clouds on the nightside and/or high atmospheric
metallicity, while the very low 3.6 $\mu$m nightside planetary brightness for
HAT-P-7b may be indicative of an enhanced global C/O ratio. We compute Bond
albedos of 0 ($<0.08$ at $1\sigma$) and $0.38\pm 0.06$ for WASP-19b and
HAT-P-7b, respectively. In the context of other planets with thermal phase

relations that account for ""relaxation"" and ""retardation."" Then, we show that
relaxation and retardation are asymptotically equivalent for small Deborah

mag and F336W > 24.7 mag. These allows us to exclude the presence of a main
sequence companion with a mass >~ 10 Msun. Through comparison with theoretical
simulations of possible progenitor populations, we show that the upper limits
to a companion detection exclude interacting binaries with semi-conservative
(late Case A or early Case B) mass transfer. The limits tend to favor systems
with non-conservative, late Case B mass transfer with intermediate initial
orbital periods and mass ratios. The most likely mass range for a putative main

star-formation in galaxies underpins our understanding of galaxy evolution over
cosmic time. Radio continuum observations can provide key information on these
two processes, in particular via the mechanical feedback produced by radio jets
in AGN, and via an unbiased dust-independent measurement of star-formation
rates. In this paper we determine radio luminosity functions at 325 MHz for a
sample of AGN and star-forming galaxies by matching a 138 deg sq. radio survey
conducted with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), with optical imaging
and redshifts from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We find that the
radio luminosity function at 325 MHz for star-forming galaxies closely follows
that measured at 1.4 GHz. By fitting the AGN radio luminosity function out to
$z = 0.5$ as a double power law, and parametrizing the evolution as ${\Phi}
\propto (1 + z)^{k}$ , we find evolution parameters of $k = 0.92 \pm 0.95$
assuming pure density evolution and $k = 2.13 \pm 1.96$ assuming pure
luminosity evolution. We find that the Low Excitation Radio Galaxies are the
dominant population in space density at lower luminosities. Comparing our 325
MHz observations with radio continuum imaging at 1.4 GHz, we determine separate
radio luminosity functions for steep and flat-spectrum AGN, and show that the
beamed population of flat-spectrum sources in our sample can be shifted in
number density and luminosity to coincide with the unbeamed population of
steep-spectrum sources, as is expected in the orientation based unification of
AGN.

low-mass stars, including the Sun, show surface fields that are generated by
dynamo processes in their convective envelopes. Intermediate-mass stars do not
have deep convective envelopes, although 10% exhibit strong surface fields that
are presumed to be residuals from the stellar formation process. These stars do
have convective cores that might produce internal magnetic fields, and these
might even survive into later stages of stellar evolution, but information has
been limited by our inability to measure the fields below the stellar surface.
Here we use asteroseismology to study the occurrence of strong magnetic fields

of dipolar oscillation modes, which can be suppressed by a strong magnetic
field in the core, in over 3600 red giant stars observed by Kepler. About 20%

be significantly below the experimental data. Also $\varepsilon_K$ in the SM
tends to be below the data. Any NP removing these anomalies will first of all
have impact on flavour observables in the $K$ meson system, in particular on
rare $K$ decays and $\Delta M_K$. Restricting the operators contributing to
$\varepsilon^\prime/\varepsilon$ to the SM ones and to the corresponding primed
operators, NP contributions are quite generally dominated either by QCD penguin
(QCDP) operators $Q_6(Q_6^\prime)$ or electroweak penguin (EWP) operators
$Q_8(Q_8^\prime)$ with rather different implications for other flavour
observables. We discuss general models with tree-level $Z$ and $Z^\prime$
flavour violating exchanges and few specific models. We find that simultaneous
enhancements of $\varepsilon^\prime/\varepsilon$, $\varepsilon_K$,
$\mathcal{B}(K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu)$ and $\mathcal{B}(K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu)$
in $Z$ scenarios are only possible in the presence of both LH and RH
flavour-violating couplings. In $Z^\prime$ scenarios this is not required but
the size of NP effects and the correlation between
$\mathcal{B}(K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu)$ and $\mathcal{B}(K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu)$
depends strongly on whether QCDP or EWP dominate NP contributions to
$\varepsilon^\prime/\varepsilon$. In the QCDP case possible enhancements of
both branching ratios are much larger than for EWP scenario and take place only
on the branch parallel to the Grossman-Nir bound, which is in the case of EWP
dominance only possible in the absence of NP in $\varepsilon_K$. QCDP and EWP
scenarios of NP in $\varepsilon^\prime/\varepsilon$ can also be uniquely
distinguished by the size and the sign of NP contribution to $\Delta M_K$,
elevating the importance of the precise calculation of $\Delta M_K$ in the SM.

enhancing or suppressing diphoton signal rate due to the imaginary-part
interference and (2) distorting resonance shape due to the real-part
interference. From the best-fit study of two benchmark models (two Higgs
doublets with $\sim$50 GeV widths and a singlet scalar with 5 GeV width, both

origin. This scenario applies to massive, tight binaries where mixing induced
by rotation and tides transports the products of hydrogen burning throughout
the stellar envelopes. This slowly enriches the entire star with helium,
preventing the build-up of an internal chemical gradient. The stars remain
compact as they evolve nearly chemically homogeneously, eventually forming two
black holes, which, we estimate, typically merge 4--11 Gyr after formation.
Like other proposed channels, this evolutionary pathway suffers from
significant theoretical uncertainties, but could be constrained in the near
future by data from advanced ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. We
perform Monte Carlo simulations of the expected merger rate over cosmic time to
explore the implications and uncertainties. Our default model for this channel
yields a local binary black hole merger rate of about $10$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$
at redshift $z=0$, peaking at twice this rate at $z=0.5$. This means that this
channel is competitive, in terms of expected rates, with the conventional
formation scenarios that involve a common-envelope phase during isolated binary
evolution or dynamical interaction in a dense cluster. The events from this
channel may be distinguished by the preference for nearly equal-mass components
and high masses, with typical total masses between 50 and 110
$\textrm{M}_\odot$. Unlike the conventional isolated binary evolution scenario
that involves shrinkage of the orbit during a common-envelope phase, short time
delays are unlikely for this channel, implying that we do not expect mergers at
high redshift.

the Habitable-Exoplanet Imaging Mission, the UV/Optical/IR Surveyor, and the

white paper and subsequent charge, namely that 1) major development of future
large flagship missions under consideration are to follow the implementation
phases of JWST and WFIRST; 2) NASA will partner with the European Space Agency
on its L3 Gravitational Wave Surveyor; 3) the Inflation Probe be classified as
a probe-class mission to be developed according to the 2010 Decadal Survey

As in our previous analysis of the planet-hosting wide binary HD20782 +
HD20781, we presume that these two G5 dwarf stars formed together and therefore
had identical primordial abundances. In this binary, HD80606 hosts an eccentric
($e\approx0.93$) giant planet at $\sim$0.5 AU, but HD80607 has no detected
planets. If close-in giant planets on eccentric orbits are efficient at
scattering rocky planetary material into their host stars, then HD80606 should
show evidence of having accreted rocky material while HD80607 should not. Here
we show that the trends of abundance versus element condensation temperature
for HD80606 and HD80607 are statistically indistinguishable, corroborating the
recent result of Saffe et al. This could suggest that both stars accreted
similar amounts of rocky material; indeed, our model for the chemical signature
of rocky planet accretion indicates that HD80606 could have accreted up to
2.5~$M_{\oplus}$ of rocky material---about half that contained in the Solar
System and primordial asteroid belt---relative to HD80607 and still be
consistent with the data. Since HD80607 has no known giant planets that might
have pushed rocky planet material via migration onto that star, we consider it
more likely that HD80606/07 experienced essentially no rocky planet accretion.
This in turn suggests that the migration history of the HD80606 giant planet
must have been such that it ejected any close-in planetary material that might
have otherwise been shepherded onto the star.

the dwarf galaxy population. Dwarf galaxies in the field are often observed to
have peculiarities in their structure, morphology, and kinematics, as well as
strong bursts of star formation without apparent cause. We aim to characterize
the signatures of minor mergers of dwarf galaxies with dark satellites to aid
their observational identification. We explore and quantify a variety of
structural, morphological, and kinematic indicators of merging dwarf galaxies
and their remnants using a suite of hydrodynamical simulations. The most
sensitive indicators of mergers with dark satellites are large asymmetries in
the gaseous and stellar distributions, enhanced central surface brightness and
starbursts, and velocity offsets and misalignments between the cold gas and
stellar components. In general, merging systems span a wide range of values of
the most commonly used indicators, while isolated objects tend to have more
confined values. Interestingly, we find in our simulations that a significantly
off-centered burst of star formation can pinpoint the location of the dark
satellite. Observational systems with such characteristics are perhaps the most
promising for unveiling the presence of the hitherto, missing satellites.

We find that the spinodal unstable region in the temperature and density plane
shrinks with increasing wave number of the unstable mode and is also reduced if
the effect of Polyakov loop is not included. In the small wave number or long
wavelength limit, the spinodal boundaries in both cases of with and without the
Polyakov loop coincide with those determined from the isothermal spinodal
instability in the thermodynamic approach. Also, the vector interactions among
quarks is found to suppress unstable modes of all wave numbers. Moreover, the
growth rate of unstable modes initially increases with the wave number but is
reduced when the wave number becomes large. Including the collisional effect
from quark scattering via the linearized Boltzmann equation, we further find
that it decreases the growth rate of unstable modes of all wave numbers.
Relevance of these results to relativistic heavy ion collisions is discussed.

new visible light beam combiner for the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer

main set of solar-like oscillations with unusually low-amplitude, wide modes. A
second set of oscillations from the other star may exist, but this marginal
detection is extremely faint. Because the two stars are nearly twins, KIC
9246715 is a difficult target for a precise test of the asteroseismic scaling
relations, which yield M = 2.17 +/- 0.14 Msun and R = 8.26 +/- 0.18 Rsun. Both
stars are consistent with the inferred asteroseismic properties, but we suspect
the main oscillator is Star 2 because it is less active than Star 1. We find
evidence for stellar activity and modest tidal forces acting over the 171-day
eccentric orbit, which are likely responsible for the essential lack of
solar-like oscillations in one star and weak oscillations in the other. Mixed
modes indicate the main oscillating star is on the secondary red clump (a
core-He-burning star), and stellar evolution modeling supports this with a
coeval history for a pair of red clump stars. This system is a useful case
study and paves the way for a detailed analysis of more red giants in eclipsing
binaries, an important benchmark for asteroseismology.

with the weak ideal property or topological dimension zero, and some results
for C*-algebras with related properties. Some of the more important results
include:
  The weak ideal property implies topological dimension zero.
  For a separable C*-algebra~A, topological dimension zero is equivalent to RR
(O_2 \otimes A) = 0, to D \otimes A having the ideal property for some (or any)
Kirchberg algebra~D, and to A being residually hereditarily in the class of all
C*-algebras B such that O_{\infty} \otimes B contains a nonzero projection.
  Extending the known result for Z_2, the classes of C*-algebras with
topological dimension zero, with the weak ideal property, and with residual
(SP) are closed under crossed products by arbitrary actions of abelian
2-groups.
  If A and B are separable, one of them is exact, A has the ideal property, and
B has the weak ideal property, then A \otimes_{min} B has the weak ideal
property.
  If X is a totally disconnected locally compact Hausdorff space and A is a C_0
(X)-algebra all of whose fibers have one of the weak ideal property,
topological dimension zero, residual (SP), or the combination of pure
infiniteness and the ideal property, then A also has the corresponding property
(for topological dimension zero, provided A is separable).
  Topological dimension zero, the weak ideal property, and the ideal property
are all equivalent for a substantial class of separable C*-algebras including
all separable locally AH algebras.
  The weak ideal property does not imply the ideal property for separable
Z-stable C*-algebras.
  We give other related results, as well as counterexamples to several other
statements one might hope for.

to enrich the conventional large-scale eigenvalue calculation used for linear

structure $\pi_{\rm st}$ on $G$. We explicitly express $\pi_n$ on each of the
$2^n$ affine coordinate charts, one for every subexpression of ${\bf u}$, in
terms of the root strings and the structure constants of the Lie algebra of
$G$. We show that the restriction of $\pi_n$ to each affine coordinate chart
gives rise to a Poisson structure on the polynomial algebra ${\mathbb{C}}[z_1,
\ldots, z_n]$ which is an {\it iterated Poisson Ore extension} of $\mathbb{C}$
compatible with a rational action by a maximal torus of $G$. For canonically
chosen $\pi_{\rm st}$, we show that the induced Poisson structure on
${\mathbb{C}}[z_1, \ldots, z_n]$ for every affine coordinate chart is in fact
defined over ${\mathbb Z}$, thus giving rise to an iterated Poisson Ore
extension of any field ${\bf k}$ of arbitrary characteristic. The special case
of $\pi_n$ on the affine chart corresponding to the full subexpression of ${\bf
u}$ yields an explicit formula for the standard Poisson structures on {\it
generalized Bruhat cells} in Bott-Samelson coordinates. The paper establishes
the foundation on generalized Bruhat cells and sets up the stage for their
applications, some of which are discussed in the Introduction of the paper.

experimentally at room temperature, showcasing their robustness against noise.
Here, we quantify the effects of thermal noise by deriving the stochastic
equations of motion for a droplet based on soliton perturbation theory. First,
it is found that deterministic droplets are linearly unstable at large bias
currents, subject to a drift instability. When the droplet is linearly stable,
our framework allows us to analytically compute the droplet's generation
linewidth and center variance. Additionally, we study the influence of
non-local and Oersted fields with micromagnetic simulations, providing insight
into their effect on the generation linewidth. These results motivate detailed
experiments on the current and temperature-dependent linewidth as well as drift
instability statistics of droplets, which are important figures-of-merit in the

at a density $n_{1/2}$ lower than or near the critical density $n_c$ at which
hadronic matter changes over to a chiral symmetry restored phase with possibly
deconfined quarks. When hidden local gauge fields and a dilaton scalar of
spontaneously broken scale symmetry with decay constant $f_\chi$ are
incorporated, this half-skyrmion phase is characterized by $f_\chi\approx
f_\pi\neq 0$ with the hidden gauge coupling $g\neq 0$ but $\ll 1$. While chiral
symmetry is restored {\it globally} in this region in the sense that
space-averaged, $\la\bar{q}q\ra$ vanishes, quarks are still confined in massive
hadrons and massless pions. This phase is shown to play a crucial role in the
model for a smooth transition from a soft EoS at low density to a stiffer EoS
at high density, the changeover taking place at $n_{1/2} \sim 2n_0$. It
resembles the ""quarkyonic phase"" predicted in large $N_c$ QCD and represents
the ""hadronic freedom"" regime which figures as a doorway to chiral restoration.
The fractionization of skyrmion matter into half-skyrmion matter has a
tantalizing analogy to what appears to happen in condensed matter in (2+1)

three satellites in low eccentricity near Earth orbits. With the help of weak
ion thrusters it is possible to accomplish tandem flight. With ion thrusters it
is also possible to mimic many kinds of mutual force laws between the
satellites. We found that both a constant repulsive force or an attractive
force that decreases with the distance are able to preserve the formation in
which the eccentricities cause the actual relative motion and the weak
thrusters keep the mean longitude difference small. Initial values are
important for the formation flight but very exact adjustment of orbital
elements is not important. Simplicity is one of our goals in this study and
this result is achieved at least in the way that, when constant force thrusters
are used, the satellites only need to detect the directions of the other ones
to fly in tandem. A repulsive acceleration of the order of 10^-6 times the
Earth attraction, is enough to effectively eliminate the disruptive effects of
all the perturbations at least for a timescale of years.

observations requires a fast method of automatic point source detection and
characterisation. In recent years, point source detection in two-dimensional
images has been implemented by using several thresholding approaches. In the
first phase of the SKA we will need a fast implementation capable of dealing
with very large images (80,000 x 80,000 pixels). While the underlying
algorithms scale suitably with image size, the present implementations do not.
We make some comments on the pertinent trade-offs for scaling these

provided the forcing is slow and weak. Both of these approximations must break
down when the material loses rigidity, such as in foams and emulsions at their
(un)jamming point -- suggesting that the window of linear elastic response near
jamming is exceedingly narrow. Yet precisely when and how this breakdown occurs
remains unclear. To answer these questions, we perform computer simulations of
stress relaxation and shear startup experiments in athermal soft sphere
packings, the canonical model for jamming. By systematically varying the strain
amplitude, strain rate, distance to jamming, and system size, we identify
characteristic strain and time scales that quantify how and when the window of
linear elasticity closes, and relate these scales to changes in the microscopic
contact network. Our findings indicate that the mechanical response of jammed
solids are generically nonlinear and rate-dependent on experimentally
accessible strain and time scales.

trend of increasing dayside-to-nightside brightness temperature difference with
increasing equilibrium temperature. Here we present a three-dimensional model
that explains this relationship, in order to shed insight on the processes that
control heat redistribution in tidally-locked planetary atmospheres. This
three-dimensional model combines predictive analytic theory for the atmospheric
circulation and dayside-nightside temperature differences over a range of
equilibrium temperature, atmospheric composition, and potential frictional drag
strengths with numerical solutions of the circulation that verify this analytic
theory. This analytic theory shows that the longitudinal propagation of waves
mediates dayside-nightside temperature differences in hot Jupiter atmospheres,
analogous to the wave adjustment mechanism that regulates the thermal structure
in Earth's tropics. These waves can be damped in hot Jupiter atmospheres by
either radiative cooling or potential frictional drag. This frictional drag
would likely be caused by Lorentz forces in a partially ionized atmosphere
threaded by a background magnetic field, and would increase in strength with
increasing temperature. Additionally, the amplitude of radiative heating and
cooling increases with increasing temperature, and hence both radiative
heating/cooling and frictional drag damp waves more efficiently with increasing
equilibrium temperature. Radiative heating and cooling play the largest role in
controlling dayside-nightside temperature temperature differences in both our
analytic theory and numerical simulations, with frictional drag only important
if it is stronger than the Coriolis force. As a result, dayside-nightside
temperature differences in hot Jupiter atmospheres increase with increasing
stellar irradiation and decrease with increasing pressure.

quoted by market makers, that varies with the market and trading conditions.
The dynamic nature of financial markets and trading, as with the rest of social
sciences, where changes can be observed and decisions can be made by
participants to influence the system, means that this model has to be adaptive
and include a feedback loop that alters the bid-offer adjustment based on the
modifications observed in the market and trading conditions, without a
significant time delay.
  The factors used to adjust the spread are price volatility, which is publicly
observable, and trade count and volume, which are generally known only to the
market maker, in various instruments over different historical durations in
time. The contributions of each factor to the bid-offer adjustment are computed
separately and then consolidated to produce a very adaptive bid-offer
quotation. The author uses the currency markets to build the sample model
because they are extremely liquid and trading in them is not as transparent as
other financial instruments, such as equities. Simulating the number of trades
and the average size of trades from a lognormal distribution, the parameters of
the lognormal distributions are chosen such that the total volume in a certain
interval matches the volume publicly mentioned by currency trading firms. This
methodology can easily be extended to other financial instruments and possibly
to any product with the ability to make electronic price quotations, or can
even be used to periodically perform manual price updates on products that are
traded non-electronically.

recently. Most of the resources and systems built so far are done for English.
The need for designing systems for other languages is increasing. This paper
surveys different ways used for building systems for subjective and sentiment
analysis for languages other than English. There are three different types of
systems used for building these systems. The first (and the best) one is the
language specific systems. The second type of systems involves reusing or
transferring sentiment resources from English to the target language. The third
type of methods is based on using language independent methods. The paper
presents a separate section devoted to Arabic sentiment analysis.

  Perspective","14 pages",,"10.1109/TIP.2017.2731208",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many patch-based image denoising algorithms can be formulated as applying a
smoothing filter to the noisy image. Expressed as matrices, the smoothing
filters must be row normalized so that each row sums to unity. Surprisingly, if
we apply a column normalization before the row normalization, the performance
of the smoothing filter can often be significantly improved. Prior works showed
that such performance gain is related to the Sinkhorn-Knopp balancing
algorithm, an iterative procedure that symmetrizes a row-stochastic matrix to a
doubly-stochastic matrix. However, a complete understanding of the performance
gain phenomenon is still lacking.
  In this paper, we study the performance gain phenomenon from a statistical
learning perspective. We show that Sinkhorn-Knopp is equivalent to an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm of learning a Gaussian mixture model of
the image patches. By establishing the correspondence between the steps of
Sinkhorn-Knopp and the EM algorithm, we provide a geometrical interpretation of
the symmetrization process. This observation allows us to develop a new
denoising algorithm called Gaussian mixture model symmetric smoothing filter
(GSF). GSF is an extension of the Sinkhorn-Knopp and is a generalization of the
original smoothing filters. Despite its simple formulation, GSF outperforms
many existing smoothing filters and has a similar performance compared to
several state-of-the-art denoising algorithms.

influenced by changing the shape of inclusions. Therefore, we deal with the
shape optimization problem to maximize low-frequency band gaps; their bounds
are determined by analysing the effective mass tensor of the homogenized
medium. Analytic transformation formulas are derived which describe dispersion
effects of resizing the inclusions. The core of the problem lies in sensitivity
of the eigenvalue problem associated with the microstructure. Computational
sensitivity analysis is developed, which allows for efficient usage of the

move in confined areas with a maximum jump length. In this paper we develop a
mean-field continuum model with truncated L\'evy flights for residential

diffusion, rather than fractional diffusion. We present an asymptotic theory to
derive the continuum equations and show excellent agreement between the
continuum model and the agent-based simulations. This suggests that local
diffusion models are universal for continuum limits of this problem, the
important quantity being the diffusion coefficient. Law enforcement agents are
also incorporated into the model, and the relative effectiveness of their
deployment strategies are compared quantitatively.

  kinetically hot residues","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1312.7376",,,,"q-bio.BM cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Physical interactions between proteins are often difficult to decipher. The
aim of this paper is to present an algorithm designed to recognize binding
patches and supporting structural scaffolds of interacting heterodimer protein
chains using the Gaussian Network Model (GNM). The recognition is based on the
(self)adjustable identification of kinetically hot residues, i.e., residues
with highest contributions to the weighted sum of fastest modes per chain
extracted via GNM, and their connection to possible binding scaffolds. The
algorithm adjusts the number of modes used in the GNM's weighted sum
calculation using the ratio of predicted and expected numbers of target
residues (contact and first layer residues). This approach produces very good
results when applied to chains forming heterodimers, especially with dimers
with high chain length ratios. The protocol's ability to recognize near native
decoys was compared to the ability of the statistical potential of Lu and
Skolnick using the Sternberg and Vakser decoy dimers sets. The statistical
potential produced better overall results, but in a number of cases its
predicting ability was comparable, or even worse than the ability of the
adjustable GNM approach. The results presented in this paper suggest that in
heterodimers, at least one partnering chain has interacting scaffold determined
by the immovable kinetically hot residues. In many cases interacting chains
(especially if being of noticeably different sizes), either behave as rigid
lock and key, or exhibit opposite dynamic behaviors. While the binding surface
of one of the chains is rigid and stable, its partner's interacting scaffold is
more flexible and adaptable.
  Authors note: The approach described here was initially given as a rough
draft in 2013 [1]. The next manuscript will describe the behavior of protein
dimers incorrectly characterized with the present approach.
