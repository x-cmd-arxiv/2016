its pleasing efficacy in exploring low-dimensional sub- space structures
embedded in data. One of its successful applications is subspace clustering, by
which data are clustered according to the subspaces they belong to. In this
paper, at a higher level, we intend to cluster subspaces into classes of
subspaces. This is naturally described as a clustering problem on Grassmann
manifold. The novelty of this paper is to generalize LRR on Euclidean space
onto an LRR model on Grassmann manifold in a uniform kernelized LRR framework.
The new method has many applications in data analysis in computer vision tasks.
The proposed models have been evaluated on a number of practical data analysis
applications. The experimental results show that the proposed models outperform
a number of state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods.

systems to improve spectrum efficiency. Macrocell users are primary users (PUs)
while those within local cells, e.g., femtocell users, or desiring
cost-effective services, e.g., roamers, are identified as secondary users
(SUs). The SUs share the spectrum resources of the PUs in a underlay way, thus
the transmit power of a secondary is strictly limited by the primary's
tolerable interference power. Given such constraints, a cooperative relaying
transmission between a SU and the macrocell base station (BS) is necessary. In
order to guarantee the success of dual-hop relaying and avoid multi-hop
relaying, a new cooperative paradigm is proposed, where an idle PU (instead of
a secondary as assumed in general) in the vicinity of a target SU is chosen to
serve as a relaying node, thanks to the fact that any PU can always transmit to
the macrocell BS directly. Moreover, two-way relaying strategy is applied at
the chosen relaying node so as to further improve the spectral efficiency. Our
results demonstrate that the proposed system is particularly suitable for
delay-tolerant wireless services with asymmetric downlink/uplink traffics, such
as e-mail checking, web browsing, social networking and data streaming, which
are the most popular applications for SUs in spectrum-sharing cellular

in comets. These crystals are believed to have been annealed in the inner part
of the proto-solar nebula, while comets should have been formed in the outer
regions. Several transport processes have been proposed to reconcile these two
facts; among them a migration driven by photophoresis. The primarily goal of
this work is to assess whether disk irradiation by a Pre-Main Sequence star
would influence the photophoretic transport. To do so, we have implemented an
evolving 1+1D model of an accretion disk, including advanced numerical
techniques, undergoing a time-dependent irradiation, consistent with the
evolution of the proto-Sun along the Pre-Main Sequence. The photophoresis is
described using a formalism introduced in several previous works. Adopting the
opacity prescription used in these former studies, we find that the disk
irradiation enhances the photophoretic transport: the assumption of a disk
central hole of several astronomical units in radius is no longer strictly
required, whereas the need for an ad hoc introduction of photoevaporation is
reduced. However, we show that a residual trail of small particles could
annihilate the photophoretic driven transport via their effect on the opacity.
We have also confirmed that the thermal conductivity of transported aggregates
is a crucial parameter which could limit or even suppress the photophoretic
migration and generate several segregation effects.

that enables the utilities to monitor and control the electricity consumption

to connect a large number of devices. On the other hand, 4G Long Term Evolution

stable service performance and higher data rates for a large number of mobile
users. Therefore, LTE is considered a promising solution for wide area
connectivity for SMs. In this paper, a grouped hierarchal architecture for SMs
communications over LTE is introduced. Then, an efficient grouped scheduling
technique is proposed for SMs transmissions over LTE. The proposed architecture
efficiently solves the overload problem due to AMI traffic and guarantees a
full monitoring and control for energy consumption. The results of our

with particular grouping and scheduling scheme. In addition, the presented
technique can able to be used in urban areas having high density of SMs.

with BS as well as classical linear stability analysis and will be a useful

to extract the latter from calculations of the former. The resulting estimates
of neutron skins indicate that two mechanisms are involved. The first
one---isovector monopole polarizability---amounts to noting that when a
particle is added to a system it drives the radii of neutrons and protons in
different directions, tending to equalize the radii of both fluids
independently of the neutron excess. This mechanism is well understood and the
Duflo-Zuker (small) neutron skin values derived 14 years ago are consistent
with recent measures and estimates. The alternative mechanism involves halo
orbits whose huge sizes tend to make the neutron skins larger and have a subtle
influence on the radial behavior of $sd$ and $pf$ shell nuclei. In particular,
they account for the sudden rise in the isotope shifts of nuclei beyond $N=28$
and the near constancy of radii in the $A=40-56$ region. This mechanism,
detected here for the first time, is not well understood and may well go beyond
Efimov physics usually associated to halo orbits.

planetary nebula. We performed a detailed study of its 3D morphology and
ionization structure using the SHAPE and MOCASSIN codes. We found that Abell 14
is a highly evolved, bipolar nebula with a kinematical age of $\sim$19,400 yr
for a distance of 4 kpc. The high He abundance, and N/O ratio indicate a
progenitor of 5 $M_{\odot}$ that has experienced the third dredge-up and hot
bottom burning phases. The stellar parameters of the central source reveal a
star at a highly evolved stage near to the white dwarf cooling track, being
inconsistent with the born again scenario. The nebula shows unexpectedly strong
[N I] $\lambda 5200$ and [O I] $\lambda 6300$ emission lines indicating
possible shock interactions. Abell 14 appears to be a member of a small group
of highly evolved, extreme Type-I PNe. The members of this group lie at the
lower-left corner of the PNe regime on the [N II]/H$\alpha$ vs. [S
II]/H$\alpha$ diagnostic diagram, where shock--excited regions/objects are also
placed. The low luminosity of their central stars, in conjunction with the
large physical size of the nebulae, result in a very low photo-ionization rate,
which can make any contribution of shock interaction easily perceptible, even
for small velocities.

as the mass and radius of a neutron star or a quark star, typically depend
strongly on their unknown internal structure. The I-Love-Q relations (between
the moment of inertia, the tidal deformability and the quadrupole moment) are
however approximately insensitive to this structure. These relations become
exact for stationary black holes in General Relativity as shown by the no-hair
theorems. In this paper, we take the first steps toward studying how the
approximate I-Love-Q relations become exact in the limit as compact stars
become black holes. To do so, we consider a toy model, i.e. incompressible
stars with anisotropic pressure, which allows us to model an equilibrium
sequence of stars with their compactness approaching the black hole limit
arbitrarily closely. We extract the I-Love-Q trio by numerically constructing
such a sequence in the slow-rotation and small-tide approximations. We find
that the I-Love-Q relations approach the black hole limit in a nontrivial way,
with the quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability changing sign as the
compactness and the amount of anisotropy are increased. Generalizing Maclaurin
spheroids to anisotropic stars, we show that the multipole moments also change
sign in the Newtonian limit as the amount of anisotropy is increased. We also
prove analytically that the stellar moment of inertia reaches the black hole
limit as the compactness reaches the black hole value in the strongly
anisotropic limit. Modeling the black hole limit through a sequence of
anisotropic stars, however, fails when considering other theories of gravity.
We calculate the scalar dipole charge and the moment of inertia in a
parity-violating modified theory and find that these quantities do not tend to
their black hole counterparts as the anisotropic stellar sequence approaches
the black hole limit.

to lower frequencies for larger chain length $L$ and the system has only one

($A_{\rm loop} \approx \nu^{-1}F^{2.5}$), which has been validated by

by multi-wire proportional chambers is no longer feasible with these
requirements, new technologies have to be employed. In the new readout chambers
the electron amplification is provided by a stack of four Gas Electron

optimised to provide an energy resolution better then 12% at the photopeak of

1% of the effective number of ions produced during gas amplification and the
primary ionisations. This is necessary to prevent the accumulation of space
charge, which eventually will distort the field in the drift volume. To ensure

number of required measurements, the estimated network parameters would differ
from the original ones. Here we present a versatile experimental technique,
which enables the study of recurrent neural networks activity while being
capable of dictating the network connectivity and synaptic strengths. This
method is based on the observation that the response of neurons depends solely
on their recent stimulations, a short-term memory. It allows a long-term scheme
of stimulation and recording of a single neuron, to mimic simultaneous activity
measurements of neurons in a recurrent network. Utilization of this technique
demonstrates the spontaneous emergence of cooperative synchronous oscillations,
in particular the coexistence of fast Gamma and slow Delta oscillations, and
opens the horizon for the experimental study of other cooperative phenomena
within large-scale neural networks.

four different phases for $d \geq 14$. As the covered area fraction $\rho$ is
increased from $0$ to $1$, the system goes from low-density disordered phase,
to orientationally-ordered nematic phase, to a columnar phase with
orientational order and also broken translational invariance, to a high density
phase in which orientational order is lost. For large d, the threshold density
for the first transition $\rho_1^*$ tends to $0$, and the critical density for

shown that the critical density for the second transition $\rho_2^*$ tends to a

the surface tension vanishes gives an estimate $\rho_2^* = 0.746$, for $d\to

signals of interest are sparse in some domain and use this to reduce the number
of measurements to encode. However, if the sparsity of the input signal is not
precisely known, but known to lie within a specified range, compressed sensing
as such cannot exploit this fact and would need to use the same number of
measurements even for a very sparse signal. In this paper, we propose a novel
method called Compressed Shattering to adapt compressed sensing to the
specified sparsity range, without changing the sensing matrix by creating
shattered signals which have fixed sparsity. This is accomplished by first
suitably permuting the input spectrum and then using a filter bank to create
fixed sparsity shattered signals. By ensuring that all the shattered signals
are utmost 1-sparse, we make use of a simple but efficient deterministic
sensing matrix to yield very low number of measurements. For a discrete-time
signal of length 1000, with a sparsity range of $5 - 25$, traditional
compressed sensing requires $175$ measurements, whereas Compressed Shattering
would only need $20 - 100$ measurements.

space $\mathcal{D}\left(\mathcal{Q},L^{p},Y\right)$ into a given Sobolev space
$W^{k,q}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ exists. As special cases, this includes embeddings
into Sobolev spaces of (homogeneous and inhomogeneous) Besov spaces,
($\alpha$)-modulation spaces, shearlet smoothness spaces and also of a large
class of wavelet coorbit spaces, in particular of shearlet-type coorbit spaces.
  Precisely, we will show that under extremely mild assumptions on the covering

$\mathcal{D}\left(\mathcal{Q},L^{p},Y\right)\hookrightarrow
W^{k,q}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ as soon as $p\leq q$ and
$Y\hookrightarrow\ell_{u^{\left(k,p,q\right)}}^{q^{\triangledown}}\left(I\right)$

$u^{\left(k,p,q\right)}$ can be easily computed, only based on the covering
$\mathcal{Q}$ and on the parameters $k,p,q$.
  Conversely, a necessary condition for existence of the embedding is that
$p\leq q$ and
$Y\cap\ell_{0}\left(I\right)\hookrightarrow\ell_{u^{\left(k,p,q\right)}}^{q}\left(I\right)$
hold, where $\ell_{0}\left(I\right)$ denotes the space of finitely supported
sequences on $I$.
  All in all, for the range $q \in (0,2]\cup\{\infty\}$, we obtain a complete
characterization of existence of the embedding in terms of readily verifiable
criteria. We can also completely characterize existence of an embedding of a

structure on tangent spaces at points of the manifold such that the structure
constants of multiplication are given by third derivatives of a potential
function on the manifold with respect to flat coordinates.
  In this paper we present a modification of that notion coming from the theory
of arrangements of hyperplanes. Namely, given natural numbers $n>k$, we have a
flat $n$-dimensional manifold and a vector space $V$ with a nondegenerate
symmetric bilinear form and an algebra structure on $V$, depending on points of
the manifold, such that the structure constants of multiplication are given by
$2k+1$-st derivatives of a potential function on the manifold with respect to
flat coordinates. We call such a structure a {\it Frobenius like structure}.
Such a structure arises when one has a family of arrangements of $n$ affine
hyperplanes in $\C^k$ depending on parameters so that the hyperplanes move

58647 using high angular (lambda/2B=0.003"") and high spectral (R=12000)
resolution interferometric VLTI-AMBER observations of the near-infrared
hydrogen emission line, Br-gamma. The star displays double peaks in both
Br-gamma line profile and wavelength-dependent visibilities. The
wavelength-dependent differential phases show S-shaped variations around the
line centre. The visibility level increases in the line (by ~0.1) at the
longest projected baseline (88 m), indicating that the size of the line
emission region is smaller than the size of the K-band continuum-emitting
region, which is expected to arise near the dust sublimation radius of the
accretion disc. The data have been analysed using radiative transfer models to
probe the geometry, size and physical properties of the wind that is emitting
Br-gamma. We find that a model with a small magnetosphere and a disc wind with
its inner radius located just outside of the magnetosphere can well reproduce
the observed Br-gamma profile, wavelength-dependent visibilities, differential
and closure phases, simultaneously. The mass-accretion and mass-loss rates
adopted for the model are Mdot_a = 3.5 x 10^{-7} Msun/yr and Mdot_dw = 4.5 x
10^{-8} Msun/yr, respectively (Mdot_dw/Mdot_a =0.13). Consequently, about 60
per cent of the angular momentum loss rate required for a steady accretion with
the measured accretion rate is provide by the disc wind. The small
magnetosphere in HD 58647 does not contribute to the Br-gamma line emission
significantly.

multiple antennas at the access points can enhance the security of three-tier

specific attractor of the limiting o.d.e. given that the iterates are in its
domain of attraction after a sufficiently large number of iterations (say) n 0

assumption of Markov iterate-dependent noise supported on a bounded subset of
the Euclidean space we give a lower bound for the lock-in probability. We use
these results to prove almost sure convergence of the iterates to the specified
attractor when the iterates satisfy an asymptotic tightness condition. The
novelty of our approach is that if the state space of the Markov process is
compact we prove almost sure convergence under much weaker assumptions compared
to the work by Andrieu et al. which solves the general state space case under
much restrictive assumptions. We also extend our single timescale results to
the case where there are two separate recursions over two different timescales.
This, in turn, is shown to be useful in analyzing the tracking ability of
general adaptive algorithms. Additionally, we show that our results can be used

secondary nodes can harvest energy from the primary network (PN) while sharing
the licensed spectrum of the PN. In order to assess the impact of different
system parameters on the proposed network, we first derive an exact expression
for the outage probability for the secondary network (SN) subject to three
important power constraints: 1) the maximum transmit power at the secondary
source (SS) and at the secondary relay (SR), 2) the peak interference power
permitted at each PU receiver, and 3) the interference power from each PU
transmitter to the SR and to the secondary destination (SD). To obtain
practical design insights into the impact of different parameters on successful
data transmission of the SN, we derive throughput expressions for both the
delay-sensitive and the delay-tolerant transmission modes. We also derive
asymptotic closed-form expressions for the outage probability and the
delay-sensitive throughput and an asymptotic analytical expression for the
delay-tolerant throughput as the number of PU transceivers goes to infinity.
The results show that the outage probability improves when PU transmitters are
located near SS and sufficiently far from SR and SD. Our results also show that
when the number of PU transmitters is large, the detrimental effect of
interference from PU transmitters outweighs the benefits of energy harvested
from the PU transmitters.

$\log d$, one of saddle and one of repelling type. Neither measure is supported
in an algebraic curve, and $T\circ f$ is `fully two dimensional' in the sense
that it does not preserve any singular holomorphic foliation. Absence of an
invariant foliation extends to all $T$ outside a countable union of algebraic
subsets. Finally, we illustrate all of our results in a more concrete
particular instance connected with a two dimensional version of the well-known
quadratic Chebyshev map.

$N$-band model, we focus on the case of a 3-band model which was suggested to
be relevant to describe some iron-based superconductors. This can lead to the
so-called $s+is$ superconducting state that breaks time-reversal symmetry due
to the competition between different pairing channels. Of particular interest
in that context, is the case of an interband dominated pairing with repulsion
between different bands. For that case we consider in detail the relevant
reduced two-component Ginzburg-Landau theory. We provide detailed analysis of
the ground state, length scales and topological properties of that model.

Magellanic Cloud, concluding that it is a SB1 long-period eclipsing binary
where the main eclipse is produced by an opaque structure hiding the secondary
star. For the more luminous component we determine an effective temperature of
6500 $\pm$ 250 $K$, log\,g = 1.0 $\pm$ 0.5 and luminosity 5970 L$_{\sun}$. From
the radial velocities of their photospheric lines we calculate a mass function
of 7.37 $\pm$ 0.55 M$_{\sun}$. Besides Balmer and forbidden N II emission, we
find splitting of metallic lines, characterized by strong discrete absorption
components (DACs), alternatively seen at the blue and red side of the
photospheric spectrum. These observations hardly can be interpreted in terms of
an structured atmosphere but might reflect mass streams in an interacting
binary. The primary shows signatures of s-process nucleosynthesis and might be
a low-mass post-AGB star with a rare evolutionary past if the binary is
semi-detached. The peak separation and constancy of radial velocity in
H$\alpha$ suggest that most of the Balmer emission comes from a circumbinary
disc.

a core-collapse supernova, in the first seconds of its life. During this phase,
the star evolution can be described as a sequence of stationary configurations,
which we determine by solving the neutrino transport and the stellar structure
equations in general relativity. We include in our model the angular momentum
loss due to neutrino emission. We find that the requirement of a rotation rate
not exceeding the mass-shedding limit at the beginning of the evolution implies
a strict bound on the rotation rate at later times. Moreover, assuming that the
proto-neutron star is born with a finite ellipticity, we determine the emitted
gravitational wave signal, and estimate its detectability by present and future
ground-based interferometric detectors.

work justifies pessimism Terence Tao in the insolvency of modern mathematics to

alternative method for studying the gradient catastrophe through the study of
the Fourier transform function through special properties phases of the Fourier
transform of this function
