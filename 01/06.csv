under suitable conditions the impact of an ultra-short and ultra-intense laser
pulse against the surface of a low-density plasma is expected to cause the
expulsion of a bunch of superficial electrons with high energy in the direction
opposite to that of the pulse propagation; this is due to the interplay of the
huge ponderomotive force, huge longitudinal field arising from charge
separation, and the finite size of the laser spot.

investigated. We show that the simplified avalanche model of Rosenbluth &

number of auxiliary random variables depend on the number of rounds of the
communication), and then provide an equivalent but simpler characterization in
terms of concave envelopes in the case of unlimited number of rounds. Two
extreme cases are given special attention. First, in the regime of very low
communication rates, the \emph{key bits per interaction bit} (KBIB) is
expressed with a new ""symmetric strong data processing constant"", which has a
concave envelope characterization analogous to that of the conventional strong
data processing constant. The symmetric strong data processing constant can be
upper bounded by the supremum of the maximal correlation coefficient over a set
of distributions, which allows us to determine the KBIB for binary symmetric
sources, and conclude, in particular, that the interactive scheme is not more
efficient than the one-way scheme at least in the low communication-rate
regime. Second, a new characterization of the \emph{minimum interaction rate
needed for achieving the maximum key rate} (MIMK) is given, and we resolve a
conjecture by Tyagi regarding the MIMK for (possibly nonsymmetric) binary

debris disc extending from 50 to 100AU and 2 different stellar types. We also
consider two levels of stirring in the disc: dynamically ""hot"" (e=0.075) and
""cold"" (e=0.01). For all cases, we derive $s_{surf}$ maps as a function of
target and projectile sizes, $s_t$ and $s_p$, and compare them to equivalent
maps for the dust-production rate. We then compute disc-integrated PSDs and
estimate the imprint of the surface energy constraint. We find that the
($s_p$,$s_t$) regions of high $s_{surf}$ values do not coincide with those of
high dust production rate. As a consequence, the surface energy constraint has
generally a weak effect on the system's PSD. The maximum $s_{surf}$-induced
depletion of $\mu$m-sized grains is $\sim 30$% and is obtained for a sun-like
star and a dynamically hot case. For the e=0.01 cases, the surface energy
effect is negligible compared to the massive small grain depletion induced by
another mechanism: the natural imbalance between dust production and
destruction rates in low-stirring discs identified by Thebault&Wu(2008).

hypothesized to represent a signature of ongoing stochastic inference in the
brain. More recently, a theoretical framework for neural sampling has been
proposed, which explains how sample-based inference can be performed by
networks of spiking neurons. One particular requirement of this approach is
that the neural response function closely follows a logistic curve.
  Analytical approaches to calculating neural response functions have been the
subject of many theoretical studies. In order to make the problem tractable,
particular assumptions regarding the neural or synaptic parameters are usually
made. However, biologically significant activity regimes exist which are not
covered by these approaches: Under strong synaptic bombardment, as is often the
case in cortex, the neuron is shifted into a high-conductance state (HCS)
characterized by a small membrane time constant. In this regime, synaptic time
constants and refractory periods dominate membrane dynamics.
  The core idea of our approach is to separately consider two different ""modes""
of spiking dynamics: burst spiking and transient quiescence, in which the
neuron does not spike for longer periods. We treat the former by propagating
the PDF of the effective membrane potential from spike to spike within a burst,
while using a diffusion approximation for the latter. We find that our
prediction of the neural response function closely matches simulation data.
Moreover, in the HCS scenario, we show that the neural response function
becomes symmetric and can be well approximated by a logistic function, thereby
providing the correct dynamics in order to perform neural sampling. We hereby
provide not only a normative framework for Bayesian inference in cortex, but
also powerful applications of low-power, accelerated neuromorphic systems to
relevant machine learning tasks.

the electron temperature decreased with increasing luminosity. This is expected
if the protons and electrons are in thermal equilibrium during an outburst with
the electrons cooled by the Compton scattering of softer seed photons from the
disk. However, the implied seed photon temperatures are unusually high,
suggesting a contribution from another source, such as the jet. No evidence of
state transitions is seen during this time period. The temporal analysis
reveals power spectra that can be modeled with two or three strong, broad
Lorentzians, similar to the power spectra of black hole binaries in their hard

Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Information Systems Technology (IST) Panel
in Istanbul, Turkey, in June 2015 to explore science and technology for
characterizing the impact of cyber-attacks on missions. Military mission
success is highly dependent on the communications and information systems
(CISs) that support the mission and their use in the cyber battlespace. The
inexorably growing dependency on computational information processing for
weapons, intelligence, communication, and logistics systems continues to
increase the vulnerability of missions to various cyber threats. Attacks on
CISs or other cyber incidents degrade or disrupt the usage of CISs, and the
resulting mission capability, performance, and completion. These incidents are
expected to increase in frequency and sophistication. The workshop participants
concluded that the key to solving the mission impact assessment problem was in
adopting and developing a new model-driven paradigm that creates and validates
mechanisms of modeling the mission organization, the mission(s), and the
cyber-vulnerable systems that support the mission(s). Such models then simulate
or portray the impacts of the cyber-attacks. In addition, such model-based
analysis could explore multiple alternative mitigation and work-around
strategies - an essential part of coping with mission impact - and select the
optimal course of mitigating actions. Only such a paradigm can be expected to
provide meaningful, actionable information about mission impacts that have not
been seen before or do not match prior experiences and patterns. The papers
presented at this workshop are available in an accompanying volume, Proceedings

advantage of the full $SU(N)$ symmetry, allowing one to work directly in each
irreducible representations of the global $SU(N)$ group. Since the $SU(N)$
singlet sector is often much smaller than the full Hilbert space, this enables
one to reach much larger system sizes than with conventional exact
diagonalizations. The method is applied to the study of Heisenberg chains in
the symmetric representation with two and three particles per site up to $N=10$
and up to 20 sites. For the length scales accessible to this approach, all
systems except the Haldane chain ($SU(2)$ with two particles per site) appear
to be gapless, and the central charge and scaling dimensions extracted from the
results are consistent with a critical behaviour in the $SU(N)$ level $k$
Wess-Zumino-Witten universality class, where $k$ is the number of particles per

product of an abelian surface $A$ and a K3 surface $X$ over a finitely
generated field $K \subset \mathbb{C}$. The Mumford-Tate conjecture is a
precise way of saying that the Hodge structure on singular cohomology conveys
the same information as the Galois representation on $\ell$-adic \'{e}tale
cohomology.
  To make this precise, let $G_{\mathrm{B}}$ be the Mumford-Tate group of the
Hodge structure $H^{2}_{\text{sing}}(A(\mathbb{C}) \times X(\mathbb{C}),
\mathbb{Q})$. Let $G_{\ell}^{\circ}$ be the connected component of the identity
of the Zariski closure of the image of the Galois group
$\textrm{Gal}(\bar{K}/K)$ in $\mathrm{GL}(H^{2}_{\text{\'{e}t}}(A_{\bar{K}}

that $G_{\mathrm{B}} \otimes \mathbb{Q}_{\ell} \cong G_{\ell}^{\circ}$. The
proof presented in this paper uses input from number theory (Chebotaryov's

confidence intervals for single components and for smooth functions of a

controls asymptotic coverage uniformly over a large class of data generating
processes. The extreme points of the calibrated projection confidence interval
are obtained by extremizing the value of the function of interest subject to a
proper relaxation of studentized sample analogs of the moment (in)equality
conditions. The degree of relaxation, or critical level, is calibrated so that
the function of theta, not theta itself, is uniformly asymptotically covered
with prespecified probability. This calibration is based on repeatedly checking
feasibility of linear programming problems, rendering it computationally
attractive.
  Nonetheless, the program defining an extreme point of the confidence interval
is generally nonlinear and potentially intricate. We provide an algorithm,
based on the response surface method for global optimization, that approximates
the solution rapidly and accurately, and we establish its rate of convergence.
The algorithm is of independent interest for optimization problems with simple
objectives and complicated constraints. An empirical application estimating an
entry game illustrates the usefulness of the method. Monte Carlo simulations
confirm the accuracy of the solution algorithm, the good statistical as well as
computational performance of calibrated projection (including in comparison to
other methods), and the algorithm's potential to greatly accelerate computation

star forming molecular clouds. There is, however, growing evidence that a
significant fraction of CO emission originates from diffuse molecular gas.
Quantifying the contribution of diffuse CO-emitting gas is vital for
understanding the relation between molecular gas and star formation. We examine
the Galactic distribution of two CO-emitting gas components, a high column
density component detected in 13CO and 12CO, and a low column density component
detected in 12CO, but not in 13CO. The ""diffuse"" and ""dense"" components are
identified using a combination of smoothing, masking, and erosion/dilation
procedures, making use of three large-scale 12CO and 13CO surveys of the Inner
and Outer Milky Way. The diffuse component, which globally represents 25
(1.5x1e8 Mo) of the total molecular gas mass (6.5x1e8 Mo), is more extended
perpendicular to the Galactic plane. The fraction of diffuse gas increases from
15% at a galactocentric radius of 3 kpc to 50% at 15 kpc, and increases with
decreasing surface density. In the Inner Galaxy, a yet denser component traced
by CS emission represents 14% of the total molecular gas mass traced by 12CO
emission. Only 14% of the molecular gas mass traced by 12CO emission is
identified as part of molecular clouds in 12CO surveys by cloud identification
algorithms. This study indicates that CO emission not only traces star forming
clouds, but also a significant diffuse molecular ISM component.

model. The model provides a simplified description of transport in marginally
stable systems including vorticity mixing in strong shear flows and electron
dynamics in plasmas. Self-consistency is incorporated through a mean-field that
couples all the degrees-of-freedom. The model is formulated as a large set of
$N$ coupled standard-like area-preserving twist maps in which the amplitude and
phase of the perturbation, rather than being constant like in the standard map,
are dynamical variables. Of particular interest is the study of the impact of
periodic orbits on the chaotic transport and coherent structures. Numerical
simulations show that self-consistency leads to the formation of a coherent
macro-particle trapped around the elliptic fixed point of the system that
appears together with an asymptotic periodic behavior of the mean field. To
model this asymptotic state, we introduced a non-autonomous map that allows a
detailed study of the onset of global transport. A turnstile-type transport
mechanism that allows transport across instantaneous KAM invariant circles in
non-autonomous systems is discussed. As a first step to understand transport,
we study a special type of orbits referred to as sequential periodic orbits.
Using symmetry properties we show that, through replication, high-dimensional
sequential periodic orbits can be generated starting from low-dimensional
periodic orbits. We show that sequential periodic orbits in the self-consistent
map can be continued from trivial (uncoupled) periodic orbits of standard-like
maps using numerical and asymptotic methods. Normal forms are used to describe
these orbits and to find the values of the map parameters that guarantee their
existence. Numerical simulations are used to verify the prediction from the
asymptotic methods.

runaway plateau regime after disruption is studied by considering the phase
space dynamic of runaways in a large aspect ratio toroidal system. We consider
the case where the toroidal field is unperturbed and the toroidal symmetry of
the system is preserved. The balance between the change in canonical angular
momentum and the input of mechanical angular momentum in such system requires
runaways to drift horizontally in configuration space for any given change in
momentum space. The dynamic of this drift can be obtained by taking the
variation of canonical angular momentum. It is then found that runaway
electrons will always drift inward as long as they are decelerating. This drift
motion is essentially non-linear, since the current is carried by runaways
themselves, and any runaway drift relative to the magnetic axis will cause
further displacement of the axis itself. A simplified analytical model is
constructed to describe such inward drift both in ideal wall case and no wall
case, and the runaway current center displacement as a function of parallel
momentum variation is obtained. The time scale of such displacement is
estimated by considering effective radiation drag, which shows reasonable
agreement with observed displacement time scale. This indicates that the phase
space dynamic studied here plays a major role in the horizontal displacement of
runaway electrons during plateau regime.

growing diversity of neutron stars (NSs) with properties spanning orders of
magnitude in magnetic field strength and ages, and with emission processes
explained by a range of mechanisms dictating their radiation properties.
However, serious difficulties exist with the magneto-dipole model of isolated
neutron star fields and their inferred ages, such as a large range of observed
braking indices ($n$, with values often $<$3) and a mismatch between the
neutron star and associated supernova remnant (SNR) ages. This problem arises
primarily from the assumptions of a constant magnetic field with $n$=3, and an
initial spin period that is much smaller than the observed current period. It
has been suggested that a solution to this problem involves magnetic field
evolution, with some NSs having magnetic fields buried within the crust by
accretion of fall-back supernova material following their birth. In this work
we explore a parametric phenomenological model for magnetic field growth that
generalizes previous suggested field evolution functions, and apply it to a
variety of NSs with both secure SNR associations and known ages. We explore the
flexibility of the model by recovering the results of previous work on buried
magnetic fields in young neutron stars. Our model fits suggest that apparently
disparate classes of NSs may be related to one another through the
time-evolution of the magnetic field.

are non-linear around 18 days; this break is attributed to a distinct variation
in mean Fourier amplitude parameters near this period for longer wavelengths as
compared to optical bands. The near-infrared P-W relations are also non-linear
except for the $W_{H,K_s}$ relation. For first-overtone mode Cepheids, a
significant change in the slope of P-L, P-W and P-C relations is found around
2.5 days only at optical wavelengths. We determine a global slope of

short periods, and significantly different to the long-period value. We do not

it takes any ensemble of decision trees as input. By explicitly accounting for
feature-sharing across trees together with accuracy/cost trade-off, our method
is able to significantly reduce feature cost by pruning subtrees that introduce
more loss in terms of feature cost than benefit in terms of prediction accuracy

the day), and passively (i.e. data are collected continuously in the
background). After data collection, we extract features to assess measures of
five key behaviors related to PD symptoms -- voice, balance, gait, dexterity,

measurements taken after a dose of medication (treatment) versus before the
medication dose (baseline). Results: A worldwide study for remote PD monitoring

online recruitment and installation, demonstrating highly cost-effective

baryonic budget in present day galaxies ranging from dwarf to Milky Way masses.
The sample is made of 88 independent high resolution cosmological zoom-in
simulations. NIHAO galaxies reproduce key properties of observed galaxies, such
as the stellar mass vs halo mass and cold gas vs stellar mass relations. Thus
they make plausible predictions for the baryon budget. We present the mass
fractions of stars, cold gas ($T<10^4$K), cool gas ($10^4 < T < 10^5$K),
warm-hot gas ($10^5 < T < 5\times10^6$K), and hot gas (T$> 5\times10^6$K)
inside the virial radius, $R_{200}$. Compared to the predicted baryon mass,
using the dark halo mass and the universal baryon fraction, $f_{\rm b}\equiv
\Omega_{\rm b}/\Omega_{\rm m}=0.15$, we find that all of our haloes are missing
baryons. The missing mass has been relocated past 2 virial radii, and cool gas
dominates the corona at low mass (M$_{200} < 3 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$) while
the warm-hot gas dominates at high mass (M$_{200} > 3 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$).
Haloes of mass $\sim 10^{10} M_\odot$ are missing $\sim 90\%$ of their baryons.
More massive haloes ($\sim 10^{12} M_\odot$) retain a higher fraction of their
baryons, with $\sim 30\%$ missing, consistent with recent observational
estimates. Moreover, these more massive haloes reproduce the observed fraction
of cold, warm-hot and hot gas. The fraction of cool gas we predict
($0.11\pm0.06$) is significantly lower than the observation from COS-HALOs
(0.3-0.47), but agrees with the alternative analysis of Stern et al. 2016.

The radio source exhibits a compact core coincident with the optical quasar and
two lobes separated by ~7 kpc, all at an impact parameter ~25 kpc. The HI 21-cm
absorption detected towards the southern lobe is found to extend over ~2 kpc^2.
The absorbing gas shows sub-kpc-scale structures with the line-of-sight
velocities dominated by turbulent motions. Much larger optical depth variations
over 4-7 kpc-scale are revealed by the non-detection of HI 21-cm absorption
towards the radio core and the northern lobe, and the detection of NaI and CaII
absorption towards the quasar. This could reflect a patchy distribution of cold
gas in the extended HI disc. We also detect HI 21-cm emission from UGC 00439
and two other galaxies within ~150 kpc to it, that probably form an interacting
group. However, no HI 21-cm emission from the absorbing gas is detected.
Assuming a linear extent of ~4 kpc, as required to cover both the core and the
southern lobe, we constrain the spin temperature <~300 K for the absorbing gas.
The kinematics of the gas and the lack of signatures of any ongoing in situ
star formation are consistent with the absorbing gas being at the kinematical
minor axis and corotating with the galaxy. Deeper HI 21-cm observations would
help to map in greater detail both the large- and small-scale structures in the

the formation of CEMP stars that are only enhanced in $s$-elements (CEMP-$s$
stars). The origin of $r$-element-enrichment in CEMP-$r/s$ stars is debated and
many formation scenarios have been put forward. We aim to determine the
likelihood of the scenarios proposed to explain the formation of CEMP-$r/s$
stars. We calculate the frequency of CEMP-$r/s$ stars among CEMP-$s$ stars for
a variety of scenarios, and we compare it with that determined from an observed
sample of CEMP-$r/s$ stars collected from the literature. The theoretical
frequency of CEMP-$r/s$ stars predicted in most scenarios underestimates the
observed ratio by at least a factor of 5. If the enrichments in $s$- and
$r$-elements are independent, the model ratio of CEMP-$r/s$ to CEMP-$s$ stars
is about 22%, that is approximately consistent with the lowest estimate of the
observed ratio. However, this model predicts that about one third of all
carbon-normal stars have [Ba/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] higher than 1, and that 40% of all
CEMP stars have [Ba/Eu]$\le0$. Stars with these properties are at least ten
times rarer in our observed sample. The $intermediate$ or $i$-process, which is
supposedly active in some circumstances during the AGB phase, could provide an
explanation of the origin of CEMP-$r/s$ stars, similar to that of CEMP-$s$
stars, in the context of wind mass accretion in binary systems. Further
calculations of the nucleosynthesis of the $i$-process and of the detailed
evolution of late AGB stars are needed to investigate if this scenario predicts
a CEMP-$r/s$ star frequency consistent with the observations.

Abelian and non-Abelian topological states of matter in two spatial dimensions.
In many cases, their success has been complemented by the vast arsenal of other
theoretical tools available to study such systems. In three dimensions,
however, much less is known about topological phases. Since the theoretical
arsenal in this case is smaller, it stands to reason that wire constructions,
which are based on one-dimensional physics, could play a useful role in
developing a greater microscopic understanding of three-dimensional topological
phases. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive strategy, based on the
geometric arrangement of commuting projectors in the toric code, to generate
and characterize coupled-wire realizations of strongly-interacting
three-dimensional topological phases. We show how this method can be used to
construct pointlike and linelike excitations, and to determine the topological
degeneracy. We also point out how, with minor modifications, the machinery
already developed in two dimensions can be naturally applied to study the
surface states of these systems, a fact that has implications for the study of
surface topological order. Finally, we show that the strategy developed for the
construction of three-dimensional topological phases generalizes readily to
arbitrary dimensions, vastly expanding the existing landscape of coupled-wire
theories. Throughout the paper, we discuss $\mathbb{Z}^{\,}_m$ topological
order in three and four dimensions as a concrete example of this approach, but
the approach itself is not limited to this type of topological order.

Graphene is a robust material for spintronics owing to its weak spin-orbit and
hyperfine interactions, while monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
possess a Zeeman effect-like band splitting in which the spin and valley
degrees of freedom are nondegenerate. The surface states of topological
insulators (TIs) exhibit a spin-momentum locking that opens up the possibility
of controlling the spin degree of freedom in the absence of an external
magnetic field. Nanostructures made of these materials are also viable for use
in quantum computing applications involving the superposition and entanglement
of individual charge and spin quanta. In this article, we review a selection of
transport studies addressing the confinement and manipulation of charges in
nanostructures fabricated from various 2D materials. We supply the entry-level
knowledge for this field by first introducing the fundamental properties of 2D
bulk materials followed by the theoretical background relevant to the physics
of nanostructures. Subsequently, a historical review of experimental
development in this field is presented, from the early demonstration of
graphene nanodevices on SiO2 substrate to more recent progress in utilizing
hexagonal boron nitride to reduce substrate disorder. In the second part of
this article, we extend our discussion to TMDs and TI nanostructures. We aim to
outline the current challenges and suggest how future work will be geared
towards developing spin qubits in 2D materials.

representations can be broadly categorized into two groups based on RGB-D
information or 3D skeleton data. Recently, skeleton-based human representations
have been intensively studied and kept attracting an increasing attention, due
to their robustness to variations of viewpoint, human body scale and motion
speed as well as the realtime, online performance. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of existing space-time representations of people based on
3D skeletal data, and provides an informative categorization and analysis of
these methods from the perspectives, including information modality,
representation encoding, structure and transition, and feature engineering. We
also provide a brief overview of skeleton acquisition devices and construction
methods, enlist a number of public benchmark datasets with skeleton data, and
discuss potential future research directions.

set of configurations of a dynamical model that are able to safely reach a
specified configuration under a control law. Unfortunately, constructing models
for systems interacting in highly dynamic environments is difficult. This paper
addresses this challenge by presenting a convex optimization method to
efficiently compute the set of configurations of a polynomial hybrid dynamical
system that are able to safely reach a user defined target set despite
parametric uncertainty in the model. This class of models describes, for
example, legged robots moving over uncertain terrains. The presented approach
utilizes the notion of occupation measures to describe the evolution of
trajectories of a nonlinear hybrid dynamical system with parametric uncertainty
as a linear equation over measures whose supports coincide with the
trajectories under investigation. This linear equation with user defined
support constraints is approximated with vanishing conservatism using a
hierarchy of semidefinite programs that are each proven to compute an
inner/outer approximation to the set of initial conditions that can reach the
user defined target set safely in spite of uncertainty. The efficacy of this
method is illustrated on a collection of six representative examples.

some X-ray afterglows. To further investigate the observed feature of spectral
softening, we now systematically search the X-ray afterglows detected by X-Ray
Telescope (XRT) of Swift and collect twelve GRBs with significant late-time
spectral softening. We find that dust scattering could be the dominant
radiative mechanism for these X-ray afterglows regarding their temporal and
spectral features. For some well observed bursts with high-quality data, their
time-resolved spectra could be well produced within the scattering scenario by
taking into account the X-ray absorption from circum-burst medium. We also find
that during spectral softening the power-law index in the high energy end of
the spectra does not vary much. The spectral softening is mainly manifested by
the spectral peak energy continually moving to the soft end.

luminous SN ever discovered, challenging the scenarios so far proposed for
stellar explosions. Here we use our radiation hydrodynamics code in order to
simulate magnetar powered SNe. To avoid explicitly assuming neutron star
properties we adopt the magnetar luminosity and spin-down timescale as free
parameters of the model. We find that the light curve (LC) of SN 2011kl is
consistent with a magnetar power source, as previously proposed, but we note
that some amount of 56^Ni (> 0.08 M_sun) is necessary to explain the low
contrast between the LC peak and tail. For the case of ASASSN-15lh we find
physically plausible magnetar parameters that reproduce the overall shape of
the LC provided the progenitor mass is relatively large (a mass of the ejecta
approx 6 M_sun). The ejecta hydrodynamics of this event is dominated by the
magnetar input, while the effect is more moderate for SN 2011kl. We conclude
that a magnetar model may be used for the interpretation of these events and
that the hydrodynamic modeling is necessary to derive the properties of
powerful magnetars and their progenitors.

with high-quality rotation curve observations to examine the fraction of
baryons in {\Lambda}CDM haloes that collect into galaxies. This 'galaxy
formation efficiency' correlates strongly and with little scatter with halo
mass, dropping steadily towards dwarf galaxies. The baryonic mass of a galaxy
may thus be used to place a lower limit on total halo mass and, consequently,
on its asymptotic maximum circular velocity. A number of observed dwarfs seem
to violate this constraint, having baryonic masses up to ten times higher than
expected from their rotation speeds, or, alternatively, rotating at only half
the speed expected for their mass. Taking the data at face value, either these
systems have formed galaxies with extraordinary efficiency - highly unlikely
given their shallow potential wells - or their dark matter content is much
lower than expected from {\Lambda}CDM haloes. This 'missing dark matter' is
reminiscent of the inner mass deficit of galaxies with slowly-rising rotation
curves, but cannot be explained away by star formation-induced 'cores' in the
dark mass profile, since the anomalous deficit applies to regions larger than
the luminous galaxies themselves. We argue that explaining the structure of
these galaxies would require either substantial modification of the standard
Lambda cold dark matter paradigm or else significant revision to the
uncertainties in their inferred mass profiles, which should be much larger than
reported. Systematic errors in inclination may provide a simple resolution to
what would otherwise be a rather intractable problem for the current paradigm.

nearly neutrally buoyant particles, exemplified by marine snow, in a
three-dimensional turbulent flow. Particles are characterized by Stokes numbers
much smaller than unity, and still water settling velocities, measured in units
of the Kolmogorov velocity, of order one. The presence of the history force in
the Maxey-Riley equation leads to individual trajectories which differ strongly
from the dynamics of both inertial particles without this force, and ideal
settling tracers. When considering, however, a large ensemble of particles, the
statistical properties of all three dynamics become more similar. The main
effect of the history force is a rather slow, power-law type convergence to an
asymptotic settling velocity of the center of mass, which is found numerically
to be the settling velocity in still fluid. The spatial extension of the
ensemble grows diffusively after an initial ballistic growth lasting up to ca.
one large eddy turnover time. We demonstrate that the settling of the center of
mass for such light aggregates is best approximated by the settling dynamics in
still fluid found with the history force, on top of which fluctuations appear
which follow very closely those of the turbulent velocity field.

and minima are often employed in applications of physics, chemistry and biology
(enzyme kinetics, protein folding, diffusion in disordered solids, transport in
organic semiconductors, relaxation in random spin systems, in supercooled
liquids and glasses). Sometimes the system needs to be modeled as a random
walker in high dimensions (like in protein folding/unfolding) where dimensions
could be the distances between different amino acid residues (as in unfolding
of HP-36). Nevertheless, most of the theoretical studies of these phenomena
still employ a one dimensional description. This is despite the prediction that
in a rough (or, rugged) energy landscape (REL), diffusion in one dimension (1d)
is predicted to be pathologically different from any higher dimension with the
increased chance of encountering broken ergodicity (Stein and Newman, 2012). We
explore the dimensionality dependent diffusion on REL by carrying out an
effective medium approximation based analytical calculations and compare them
with the available computer simulation results. We find that at intermediate
level of ruggedness (assumed to have a Gaussian distribution), where diffusion
is well-defined, the value of the effective diffusion coefficient depends on
dimensionality and changes (increases) by several factors (~5-10) in going from
1d to 2d. In contrast, the changes in subsequent transitions (like 2d to 3d and
3d to 4d and so on) are far more modest, of the order of 10-20% only. When
ruggedness is given by random traps with an exponential distribution of barrier
heights, the mean square displacement is sub-diffusive (a well-known result),
but the growth of MSD is described by different exponents in one and higher
dimensions. The exponent of growth is larger in higher dimensions than in 1d.

However, three-dimensional (3D) topological semimetals for carbon materials are
still rare. Searching for such materials with salient physics has become a new
direction for carbon research. Here, using first-principles calculations and
tight-binding modeling, we study three types of 3D graphene networks whose
properties inherit those of Dirac electrons in graphene. In the band structures
of these materials, two flat Weyl surfaces appear in the Brillouin zone (BZ),
which straddle the Fermi level and are robust against external strain. When the
networks are cut, the resulting lower-dimensional slabs and nanowires remain to
be semimetallic with Weyl line-like and point-like Fermi surfaces,
respectively. Between the Weyl lines, flat surface bands emerge with strong
magnetism when each surface carbon atom is passivated by one hydrogen atom. The
robustness of these structures can be traced back to a bulk topological
invariant, ensured by the sublattice symmetry, and to the one-dimensional (1D)
Weyl semimetal behavior of the zigzag carbon chain, which has been the common
backbone to all these structures. The flat Weyl-surface semimetals may enable
applications in correlated electronics, as well as in energy storage, molecular
sieve, and catalysis because of their good stability, porous geometry, and
large superficial area.

let $\mathfrak{N}(G)$ be the set of all labeled maximal forests of $G$. The
forest graph of $G$, denoted by $\mathbf{F}(G)$, is the graph with vertex set
$\mathfrak{N}(G)$ in which two maximal forests $F_1$, $F_2$ of $G$ form an edge

unable to carry out experiments to determine the function of every single gene
product. Therefore, to gain insights into the activity of these molecules and
guide experiments, we must rely on computational means to functionally annotate
the majority of sequence data. To understand how well these algorithms perform,
we have established a challenge involving a broad scientific community in which
we evaluate different annotation methods according to their ability to predict
the associations between previously unannotated protein sequences and Gene

with evaluating computational methods in an ongoing community-wide challenge.

underlying network grows is a problem of increasing importance in complex
dynamical systems as well as sustainability science and engineering. We address
the question of whether a complex network of nonlinear oscillators can maintain
its synchronization stability as it expands or grows. A network in the real
world can never be completely synchronized due to noise and/or external
disturbances. This is especially the case when, mathematically, the transient
synchronous state during the growth process becomes marginally stable, as a
local perturbation can trigger a rapid deviation of the system from the
vicinity of the synchronous state. In terms of the nodal dynamics, a large
scale avalanche over the entire network can be triggered in the sense that the
individual nodal dynamics diverge from the synchronous state in a cascading
manner within a short time period. Because of the high dimensionality of the
networked system, the transient process for the system to recover to the
synchronous state can be extremely long. Introducing a tolerance threshold to
identify the desynchronized nodes, we find that, after an initial stage of
linear growth, the network typically evolves into a critical state where the
addition of a single new node can cause a group of nodes to lose
synchronization, leading to synchronization collapse for the entire network. A
statistical analysis indicates that, the distribution of the size of the
collapse is approximately algebraic (power law), regardless of the fluctuations
in the system parameters. This is indication of the emergence of self-organized
criticality. We demonstrate the generality of the phenomenon of synchronization
collapse using a variety of complex network models, and uncover the underlying
dynamical mechanism through an eigenvector analysis.

traffic's complex macro-scale dynamics, and are often used by practitioners for
road network planning, integrated corridor management, and other applications.
These models have two parts: a link model, which describes traffic flow
behavior on individual roads, and a node model, which describes behavior at
road junctions. As the road networks under study become larger and more complex
--- nowadays often including arterial networks --- the node model becomes more
important. This paper focuses on the first order node model and has two main
contributions. First, we formalize the multi-commodity flow distribution at a
junction as an optimization problem with all the necessary constraints. Most
interesting here is the formalization of input flow priorities. Then, we
discuss a very common ""conservation of turning fractions"" or
""first-in-first-out"" (FIFO) constraint, and how it often produces unrealistic
spillback. This spillback occurs when, at a diverge, a queue develops for a
movement that only a few lanes service, but FIFO requires that all lanes
experience spillback from this queue. As we show, avoiding this unrealistic
spillback while retaining FIFO in the node model requires complicated network
topologies. Our second contribution is a ""partial FIFO"" mechanism that avoids
this unrealistic spillback, and a node model and solution algorithm that
incorporates this mechanism. The partial FIFO mechanism is parameterized
through intervals that describe how individual movements influence each other,
can be intuitively described from physical lane geometry and turning movement
rules, and allows tuning to describe a link as having anything between full
FIFO and no FIFO. Excepting the FIFO constraint, the present node model also
fits within the well-established ""general class of first-order node models"" for
multi-commodity flows.

LRMF techniques are constructed on the optimization problems using L1-norm and
L2-norm losses, which mainly deal with Laplacian and Gaussian noises,
respectively. To make LRMF capable of adapting more complex noise, this paper
proposes a new LRMF model by assuming noise as Mixture of Exponential Power
(MoEP) distributions and proposes a penalized MoEP (PMoEP) model by combining
the penalized likelihood method with MoEP distributions. Such setting
facilitates the learned LRMF model capable of automatically fitting the real
noise through MoEP distributions. Each component in this mixture is adapted
from a series of preliminary super- or sub-Gaussian candidates. Moreover, by
facilitating the local continuity of noise components, we embed Markov random
field into the PMoEP model and further propose the advanced PMoEP-MRF model. An
Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and a variational EM (VEM) algorithm
are also designed to infer the parameters involved in the proposed PMoEP and
the PMoEP-MRF model, respectively. The superseniority of our methods is
demonstrated by extensive experiments on synthetic data, face modeling,

  Access Networks","14 pages, 8 figures, accepted by JSAC Energy-Efficient Techniques for
  5G Wireless Communication Systems special issue",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the energy efficiency of the cloud radio access network
(C-RAN), specifically focusing on two fundamental and different downlink
transmission strategies, namely the data-sharing strategy and the compression
strategy. In the data-sharing strategy, the backhaul links connecting the
central processor (CP) and the base-stations (BSs) are used to carry user
messages -- each user's messages are sent to multiple BSs; the BSs locally form
the beamforming vectors then cooperatively transmit the messages to the user.
In the compression strategy, the user messages are precoded centrally at the
CP, which forwards a compressed version of the analog beamformed signals to the
BSs for cooperative transmission. This paper compares the energy efficiencies
of the two strategies by formulating an optimization problem of minimizing the
total network power consumption subject to user target rate constraints, where
the total network power includes the BS transmission power, BS activation
power, and load-dependent backhaul power. To tackle the discrete and nonconvex
nature of the optimization problems, we utilize the techniques of reweighted
$\ell_1$ minimization and successive convex approximation to devise provably
convergent algorithms. Our main finding is that both the optimized data-sharing
and compression strategies in C-RAN achieve much higher energy efficiency as
compared to the non-optimized coordinated multi-point transmission, but their
comparative effectiveness in energy saving depends on the user target rate. At
low user target rate, data-sharing consumes less total power than compression,
however, as the user target rate increases, the backhaul power consumption for
data-sharing increases significantly leading to better energy efficiency of
compression at the high user rate regime.

the propagation speed of a gravitational wave (GW). In general relativity, a GW
propagates with the speed of light, while in the alternative theories of
gravity the propagation speed could deviate from the speed of light due to the
modification of gravity or spacetime structure at a quantum level. Previously
we proposed the method measuring the GW speed by directly comparing the arrival
times between a GW and a photon from the binary merger of neutron stars or
neutron star and black hole, assuming that it is associated with a short
gamma-ray burst. The sensitivity is limited by the intrinsic time delay between
a GW and a photon at the source. In this paper, we extend the method to
distinguish the intrinsic time delay from the true signal caused by anomalous
GW speed with multiple events at cosmological distances, also considering the
redshift distribution of GW sources, redshift-dependent GW propagation speed,

this paper, inter-tier interference suppression techniques are considered in

beamforming (BF) are proposed to suppress the inter-tier interference, and
their corresponding performance is evaluated. Closed-form expressions for the
overall outage probabilities, system capacities, and average bit error rates

via power allocation, which is solved with convex optimization. Simulation

schemes depends on system parameters, such as the number of antennas at the
MBS, the number of RRHs, and the target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
threshold. Furthermore, it is seen that the sum rates of IC and BF schemes
increase almost linearly with the transmit power threshold under the proposed

process is characterized by a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with finite
variances. The scaling exponent $\mu$ of polar codes for a binary-input
memoryless channel (BMC) characterizes the closest gap between the capacity and
non-asymptotic rates achieved by polar codes with error probabilities no larger
than some non-vanishing $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$. It has been shown that for any
$\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, the scaling exponent $\mu$ for any binary-input

valid upper bound on the scaling exponent for any binary-input EH channel,
i.e., a BMC subject to additional EH constraints. Our result thus implies that
the EH constraints do not worsen the rate of convergence to capacity if polar
codes are employed. The main result is proved by leveraging the following three

in modeling the effect of interference management techniques, which typically
introduce some form of spatial interaction among active transmitters. In some
applications, such as cognitive radio and device-to-device networks, this
interaction may result in the formation of holes in an otherwise homogeneous
interference field. The resulting interference field can be accurately modeled
as a Poisson Hole Process (PHP). Despite the importance of PHP in many
applications, the exact characterization of interference experienced by a
typical node in a PHP is not known. In this paper, we derive several tight
upper and lower bounds on the Laplace transform of this interference. Numerical
comparisons reveal that the new bounds outperform all known bounds and
approximations, and are remarkably tight in all operational regimes of
interest. The key in deriving these tight and yet simple bounds is to capture
the local neighborhood around the typical point accurately while simplifying
the far field to attain tractability. Ideas for tightening these bounds further
by incorporating the effect of overlaps in the holes are also discussed. These
results immediately lead to an accurate characterization of the coverage
probability of the typical node in a PHP under Rayleigh fading.

constructing a dual transformation, we demonstrate that this $2\mathbb{Z}$

ferromagnetic insulators. As a result of the duality, the topology of the
electronic structures for a $d+id$ superconductor is controllable via the
change of the chemical potential by tuning the gate voltage. In particular,
instead of being always a chiral superconductor, we find that the $d+id$
superconductor undergoes a topological phase transition from a chiral
superconductor to a quasi-helical superconductor as the gap amplitude or the
chemical potential decreases. The quasi-helical superconducting phase is found
to be characterized by a topological invariant in the pseudo-spin charge sector
with vanishing both the Chern number and the spin Chern number. We further
elucidate the topological phase transition by analyzing the relationship
between the topological invariant and the rotation symmetry. Due to the angular
momentum carried by the gap function and spin-orbit interactions, we show that

notions of connectivity in multi-layer networks. Using this model, it is easy
to demonstrate that in multi-layer networks the three notions may differ
dramatically. Unfortunately, in contrast to the single-layer case, where the
values of the three connectivity notions can be computed efficiently, it has
been recently shown in the context of WDM networks (results that can be easily

connectivity are hard to compute or even approximate in multi-layer networks.
The current paper shed some positive light into the multi-layer connectivity

extensive air shower (EAS) may results in great systematic mis-estimation of
EAS parameters. The reconstruction of those EASs whose core locations are
outside the boundary of a surface array (outside EAS (OEAS)) results in a large
distance of the reconstructed core location from the true one, especially when
the true core is far outside the array. Although it may not be mentioned, the
identification of OEASs is a necessary and important step in the reconstruction
procedure of an EAS. In this paper, an existing technique is optimized for the
identification of OEASs. The simultaneous use of this technique and a recently
developed approach for reconstructing the core location of an EAS can
significantly increase the sensitive area of a surface array.

frequency shifts, due to atomic motion can play an important role in adiabatic
population transfer processes of atomic internal states by a pair of laser
fields. For the limiting case of slow atoms ( Doppler shift much smaller than
the photon recoil energy) the atoms occupy the same target state regardless of
the order of switching of laser fields, while for the case of fast atoms
interacting with the intuitive sequence of pulses, the target state is the
intermediate atomic state. It is shown that these processes are robust with

relative spatial offset (delay) of the laser beams. The obtained results can be
used for the control of temporal evolution of atomic populations in atomic

the principal drivers of galaxy evolution and can be used as tracers of the
large-scale structure and the underlying cosmology. However, the detection of
galaxy groups from galaxy redshift survey data is hampered by several
observational limitations.
  Aims. We improve the widely used friends-of-friends (FoF) group finding
algorithm with membership refinement procedures and apply the method to a
combined dataset of galaxies in the local Universe. A major aim of the
refinement is to detect subgroups within the FoF groups, enabling a more
reliable suppression of the fingers-of-God effect.
  Methods. The FoF algorithm is often suspected of leaving subsystems of groups
and clusters undetected. We used a galaxy sample built of the 2MRS, CF2, and
2M++ survey data comprising nearly 80000 galaxies within the local volume of
430 Mpc radius to detect FoF groups. We conducted a multimodality check on the
detected groups in search for subgroups. We furthermore refined group
membership using the group virial radius and escape velocity to expose unbound
galaxies. We used the virial theorem to estimate group masses.
  Results. The analysis results in a catalogue of 6282 galaxy groups in the
2MRS sample with two or more members, together with their mass estimates. About
half of the initial FoF groups with ten or more members were split into smaller
systems with the multimodality check. An interesting comparison to our detected
groups is provided by another group catalogue that is based on similar data but
a completely different methodology. Two thirds of the groups are identical or
very similar. Differences mostly concern the smallest and largest of these
other groups, the former sometimes missing and the latter being divided into
subsystems in our catalogue.

collection of problems that are simply placed inside the P-solvable
optimization class PO never have been studiously analyzed regarding their exact
computational complexity. To improve this situation, the existing framework
based on polynomial-time computability needs to be expanded and further refined
for an insightful analysis of various approximation algorithms targeting
optimization problems within PO. In particular, we deal with those problems
characterized in terms of logarithmic-space computations and uniform-circuit
computations. We are focused on nondeterministic logarithmic-space (NL)

optimization and approximation classes, dubbed as, NLO, LO, APXL, and LSAS as
well as new classes NC1O, APXNC1, NC1AS, and AC0O, which are founded on uniform
families of Boolean circuits. Although many NL decision problems can be
naturally converted into NL optimization (NLO) problems, few NLO problems have
been studied vigorously. We thus provide a number of new NLO problems falling
into those low-complexity classes. With the help of NC1 or AC0
approximation-preserving reductions, we also identify the most difficult
problems (known as complete problems) inside those classes. Finally, we
demonstrate a number of collapses and separations among those refined
optimization and approximation classes with or without unproven

living matter has not been investigated yet. We present an experimental test of
the Jarzynski equality predictions on a paradigmatic physical model, i.e. a
Brownian particle held in an optical potential, coupled either to a thermal

presence of non-Boltzmann statistics. We corroborate our experimental findings

energy ranges from the order of $10^{32}$ erg to $10^{36}$ erg. Using these new
data combined with the results from the data with 30-min sampling, we found the
occurrence frequency ($dN/dE$) of superflares as a function of flare energy
($E$) shows the power-law distribution ($dN/dE \propto E ^{-\alpha}$) with
$\alpha=1.5$ for $10^{33}<E<10^{36}$ erg. The upper limit of energy released by
superflares is basically comparable to a fraction of the magnetic energy stored
near starspots which is estimated from the amplitude of brightness variations.
We also found that the duration of superflares ($\tau$) increases with the
flare energy ($E$) as $\tau \propto E^{0.39\pm 0.03}$. This can be explained if
we assume the time-scale of flares is determined by the Alfv$\acute{\rm e}$n
time.

the unique states of resonant energy transfer manifested by the regular energy
pulsations localized on the first two elements of the chain. This state is
regarded as the higher dimensional analog of limiting phase trajectory
corresponding to the regime of maximal energy transfer in the 2DOF, anharmonic,
oscillatory models. We show that in contrast to the limiting phase
trajectories, this special state of local energy transfer emerging in the
Klein-Gordon trimer undergoes additional transition leading to its complete
elimination. By employing the special order reduction procedure, we describe
analytically the mechanism of formation and destruction of this peculiar,
dynamical state. Finally, we demonstrate the strong correlation between the
bifurcations of this state to the series of spontaneous transitions from
localized to delocalized energy pulsations undergone by the impulsive response
of the Klein-Gordon trimer. Results of the analytical model are well in

The dynamics of light in such lattices crucially depends on the ratio of the

lattice period. Depending on the longitudinal period, one can achieve either
beam rectification, when the input light propagates at a fixed angle across the
structure without diffractive broadening, or dynamic localization, when the
initial intensity distribution is periodically restored after each longitudinal
period. Importantly, the transition between these two different propagation

patterns will occur. Models consistently project that the intensity of
individual precipitation events increases by approximately 6-7%/K, following
the increase in atmospheric water content, but that total precipitation
increases by a lesser amount (1-2 %/K in the global average in transient runs).
Some other aspect of precipitation events must then change to compensate for
this difference. We develop here a new methodology for identifying individual
rainstorms and studying their physical characteristics - including starting
location, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and trajectory - that allows
identifying that compensating mechanism. We apply this technique to
precipitation over the contiguous U.S. from both radar-based data products and
high-resolution model runs simulating 80 years of business-as-usual warming. In
model studies, we find that the dominant compensating mechanism is a reduction
of storm size. In summer, rainstorms become more intense but smaller, in
winter, rainstorm shrinkage still dominates, but storms also become less
numerous and shorter duration. These results imply that flood impacts from
climate change will be less severe than would be expected from changes in
precipitation intensity alone. We show also that projected changes are smaller
than model-observation biases, implying that the best means of incorporating
them into impact assessments is via ""data-driven simulations"" that apply
model-projected changes to observational data. We therefore develop a
simulation algorithm that statistically describes model changes in
precipitation characteristics and adjusts data accordingly, and show that,
especially for summertime precipitation, it outperforms simulation approaches
that do not include spatial information.

Existence of global weak solutions to compressible isentropic finitely
extensible bead-spring chain models for dilute polymers, Math. Models Methods
Appl. Sci., 26 (2016)], we consider the compressible Navier--Stokes system
coupled with a Fokker--Planck type equation describing the motion of polymer
molecules in a viscous compressible fluid occupying a bounded spatial domain,
with polymer-number-density-dependent viscosity coefficients. The model arises
in the kinetic theory of dilute solutions of nonhomogeneous polymeric liquids,
where the polymer molecules are idealized as bead-spring chains with finitely
extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) type spring potentials. The motion of the
solvent is governed by the unsteady, compressible, barotropic Navier--Stokes
system, where the viscosity coefficients in the Newtonian stress tensor depend
on the polymer number density. Our goal is to show that the existence theory
developed in the case of constant viscosity coefficients can be extended to the
case of polymer-number-density-dependent viscosities, provided that certain
technical restrictions are imposed, relating the behavior of the viscosity
coefficients and the pressure for large values of the solvent density. As a
first step in this direction, we prove here the weak sequential stability of
the family of dissipative (finite-energy) weak solutions to the system.

within geographical epidemiology and are typically analysed within a Bayesian
hierarchical model formulation. A variety of model formulations for the latent
level have been proposed but all come with inherent issues. In the classical
BYM model, the spatially structured component cannot be seen independently from
the unstructured component. This makes prior definitions for the
hyperparameters of the two random effects challenging. There are alternative
model formulations that address this confounding, however, the issue on how to
choose interpretable hyperpriors is still unsolved. Here, we discuss a recently
proposed parameterisation of the BYM model that leads to improved parameter
control as the hyperparameters can be seen independently from each other.
Furthermore, the need for a scaled spatial component is addressed, which
facilitates assignment of interpretable hyperpriors and make these transferable
between spatial applications with different graph structures. We provide
implementation details for the new model formulation which preserve sparsity
properties, and we investigate systematically the model performance and compare
it to existing parameterisations. Through a simulation study, we show that the
new model performs well, both showing good learning abilities and good
shrinkage behaviour. In terms of model choice criteria, the proposed model
performs at least equally well as existing parameterisations, but only the new
formulation offers parameters that are interpretable and hyperpriors that have
a clear meaning.

compute the dynamical structure factor. Our main result is that when this
triplet excitation is optimized in such a way that the corresponding sum rule
is fulfilled, we recover the low and high energy spectral weight features of

depletion at $(\pi,0)$ found in recent inelastic neutron scattering experiments
can be attributed to the interference of the triplet bond excitations of the

physical systems to achieve some intended goal, including the second law of
thermodynamics, entropy bounds in quantum information theory, and the
uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Recent results provide physically
meaningful enhancements of these limiting statements, determining how well one
can attempt to reverse an irreversible process. In this paper, we apply and
extend these results to give strong enhancements to several entropy
inequalities, having to do with entropy gain, information gain, entropic
disturbance, and complete positivity of open quantum systems dynamics. Our
first result is a remainder term for the entropy gain of a quantum channel.
This result implies that a small increase in entropy under the action of a
subunital channel is a witness to the fact that the channel's adjoint can be
used as a recovery map to undo the action of the original channel. Our second
result regards the information gain of a quantum measurement, both without and
with quantum side information. We find here that a small information gain
implies that it is possible to undo the action of the original measurement if
it is efficient. The result also has operational ramifications for the
information-theoretic tasks known as measurement compression without and with
quantum side information. Our third result shows that the loss of Holevo
information caused by the action of a noisy channel on an input ensemble of
quantum states is small if and only if the noise can be approximately corrected
on average. We finally establish that the reduced dynamics of a
system-environment interaction are approximately completely positive and
trace-preserving if and only if the data processing inequality holds
approximately.

that cannot be implemented without the dissipation become achievable by the
action of the strong dissipative process. Here we generalize this idea by
identifying decoherence-free subspaces (DFS's) as the subspaces in which the
dynamics becomes more complex. Applying methods from quantum control theory we
characterize the set of reachable operations within the DFS's. We provide three
examples which become fully controllable within the DFS's while the control
over the original Hilbert space in the absence of dissipation is trivial. In
particular, we show that the (classical) Ising Hamiltonian is turned into a
Heisenberg Hamiltonian by strong collective decoherence, which provides
universal quantum computation within the DFS's. Moreover we perform numerical
gate optimization to study how the process fidelity scales with the noise
strength. As a byproduct a subsystem fidelity which can be applied in other

work and applied to the problem of collapse. The first category is concerned
with local and transient features of the entanglement between a macroscopic
measuring system and a measured one. These properties result directly from the
Schr\""odinger equation. They cannot be formulated in terms of observables, do
not affect the wave functions themselves but express their history in an
irreversible way. They carry a specific new kind of local probabilities, which
evolve with a finite velocity under nonlinear wave equations. The second
category of results extends these local properties to the case of a macroscopic
system and its environment. Fluctuations in their interaction are predicted
then and generate a specific incoherence in the quantum state of the system.
These two kinds of effects act together when a macroscopic measuring system
interacts with a measured system and with an environment. Their combination
yields then an explicit and effective mechanism of collapse, with a random
behavior resulting from random incoherence. Born's basic probability rule for
the results of measurements turns out then simply a consequence of quantum
dynamics. Some conjectures still enter into the derivation of these effects,
which one may recognize to look hardly credible at first sight. They fit
however so well together that one proposes a more thorough investigation of
their approach as a promising strategy for a self-contained explanation of
collapse.

semianalytical model. In the low field regime below 400 Oe a hysteretic
behavior in the mode spectrum is found. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that
the origin of the observed spectra is due to the initialization of different
magnetization states of individual nanomagnets. Our results indicate that it
might be possible to determine the spin-ice state by resonance experiments and
are a first step towards the understanding of artificial geometrically
frustrated magnetic systems in the high-frequency regime.

Problems in different fields involving qualitative, quantitative and uncertain

in [17] which generalizes intuitionistic fuzzy values [1,7,17], interval valued
intuitionistic fuzzy number (IVIFN) [10] than with usual IFNs [5,11,21].

unlikely that superradiance could take place in thermally relaxed regions and
that the lack of observational evidence of masers for this transition reduces
the probability of detecting superradiance, in situations where the conditions
necessary for superradiance are met (i.e., close atomic spacing, high velocity
coherence, population inversion, and long dephasing time-scales compared to
those related to coherent behavior), our results suggest that relatively low
levels of population inversion over short astronomical length-scales (e.g., as
compared to those required for maser amplification) can lead to the cooperative
behavior required for superradiance in the ISM. Given the results of our
analysis, we expect the observational properties of 21-cm superradiance to be
characterized by the emission of high intensity, spatially compact, burst-like
features potentially taking place over short periods ranging from minutes to

masers in the outer shells of envelopes of these stars implies the existence of
a population inversion and a high level of velocity coherence, and that these

superradiance can also happen in these regions. Superradiance is characterized
by high intensity, spatially compact, burst-like features taking place over
time-scales on the order of seconds to years, depending on the size and
physical conditions present in the regions harboring such sources of radiation.

CCD/CMOS sensor) dynamics is occupied by the reference field signal, whose
energy is orders of magnitude higher than the field scattered by the imaged

adjusted by adding a 4-f device to a conventional in-line holographic setup,
making it possible to reduce the weight of the reference field while keeping
the object field almost constant. Theoretical analysis of the Cr\`amer-Rao
lower bounds of the corresponding imaging model illustrate the advantages of
this approach. These lower bounds can be asymptotically reached using a
parametric inverse problems reconstruction. This implementation results in a 60

direction for the case of a simple electrostatic motor. The motor is composed
by a rotor and two electronic reservoirs. Electronic islands on the rotor can
exchange electrons with the reservoirs. An electrostatic field exerts a force
on the occupied islands. The charge dynamics and the electrostatic field drive
rotations of the rotor. Coupling to an environment lead to damping on the
rotational degree of freedom. We use two different approaches to the charge
dynamics in the electronic islands: hopping process and mean-field. The hopping
process approach takes into account charge fluctuations, which can appear along
Coulomb blockade effects in nanoscale systems. The mean-field approach neglects
the charge fluctuations on the islands, which is typically suitable for larger
systems. We show that for a system described by the mean-field equations one
can in principle prepare initial conditions to obtain a desired rotational
direction. In contrast, this is not possible in the stochastic description.
However, for both cases one can achieve rotational directionality by changing
the geometry of the rotor. By scanning the space formed by the relevant
geometric parameters we find optimal geometries, while fixing the dissipation
and driving parameters. Remarkably, in the hopping process approach perfect
rotational directionality is possible for a large range of geometries.

equivalent to an optimal network-wide cooperative beamformer design algorithm

constraints, which can be regarded as the weighted sum EE maximization problem
and solved by a generalized weighted minimum mean square error approach. The
mathematical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that a tradeoff
between EE and queuing delay can be achieved, and this tradeoff strictly
depends on the fronthaul constraint.
