  2014 September",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cloud Computing researches involve a tremendous amount of entities such as
users, applications, and virtual machines. Due to the limited access and often
variable availability of such resources, researchers have their prototypes
tested against the simulation environments, opposed to the real cloud
environments. Existing cloud simulation environments such as CloudSim and
EmuSim are executed sequentially, where a more advanced cloud simulation tool
could be created extending them, leveraging the latest technologies as well as
the availability of multi-core computers and the clusters in the research
laboratories. While computing has been evolving with multi-core programming,
MapReduce paradigms, and middleware platforms, cloud and MapReduce simulations
still fail to exploit these developments themselves. This research develops
Cloud2Sim, which tries to fill the gap between the simulations and the actual
technology that they are trying to simulate.
  First, Cloud2Sim provides a concurrent and distributed cloud simulator, by
extending CloudSim cloud simulator, using Hazelcast in-memory key-value store.
Then, it also provides a quick assessment to MapReduce implementations of
Hazelcast and Infinispan, adaptively distributing the execution to a cluster,
providing means of simulating MapReduce executions. The dynamic scaler solution
scales out the cloud and MapReduce simulations to multiple nodes running
Hazelcast and Infinispan, based on load. The distributed execution model and
adaptive scaling solution could be leveraged as a general purpose auto scaler
middleware for a multi-tenanted deployment.

form factor is extracted, in a model-independent way, using existing data on
the $\pi^{-}\pi^{0}$ one. For the participant scalar form factor, we have
considered different parameterizations ordered according to their increasing
fulfillment of analyticity and unitarity constraints. We start with a
Breit-Wigner parameterization dominated by the $a_{0}(980)$ scalar resonance
and after we include its excited state, the $a_{0}(1450)$. We follow by an
elastic dispersion relation representation through the Omn\`{e}s integral.
Then, we illustrate a method to derive a closed-form expression for the
$\pi^{-}\eta$, $\pi^{-}\eta^{\prime}$ (and $K^{-}K^{0}$) scalar form factors in
a coupled-channels treatment. Finally, predictions for the branching ratios and
spectra are discussed emphasizing the error analysis. An interesting result of
this study is that both $\tau^{-}\to\pi^{-}\eta^{(\prime)}\nu_{\tau}$ decay
channels are promising for the soon discovery of second-class currents at
Belle-II. We also predict the relevant observables for the partner
$\eta^{(\prime)}_{\ell 3}$ decays, which are extremely suppressed in the

values of the operator. Moreover, when operator is affine our linesearch
becomes very simple, namely, it needs only vector-vector multiplication. For
all our methods we establish the ergodic convergence rate. Although the
proposed methods are very general, sometimes they may show much better
performance even for optimization problems. The reason for this is that they
often can use larger stepsizes without additional expensive computation.

neutron-rich $^{29,30}$Na isotopes, obtained via Coulomb dissociation (CD)
measurements as a method of the direct probe. The invariant mass spectra of
those nuclei have been obtained through measurement of the four-momentum of all
decay products after Coulomb excitation on a $^{208}Pb$ target at energies of
400-430 MeV/nucleon using FRS-ALADIN-LAND setup at GSI, Darmstadt. Integrated
Coulomb-dissociation cross-sections (CD) of 89 $(7)$ mb and 167 $(13)$ mb up to
excitation energy of 10 MeV for one neutron removal from $^{29}$Na and
$^{30}$Na respectively, have been extracted. The major part of one neutron
removal, CD cross-sections of those nuclei populate core, in its' ground state.
A comparison with the direct breakup model, suggests the predominant occupation
of the valence neutron in the ground state of $^{29}$Na${(3/2^+)}$ and
$^{30}$Na${(2^+)}$ is the $d$ orbital with small contribution in the
$s$-orbital which are coupled with ground state of the core. The ground state
configurations of these nuclei are as $^{28}$Na$_{gs (1^+)\otimes\nu_{s,d}$ and
$^{29}$Na$_{gs}(3/2^+)\otimes\nu_{ s,d}$, respectively. The ground state spin
and parity of these nuclei, obtained from this experiment are in agreement with
earlier reported values. The spectroscopic factors for the valence neutron
occupying the $s$ and $d$ orbitals for these nuclei in the ground state have
been extracted and reported for the first time. A comparison of the
experimental findings with the shell model calculation using MCSM suggests a
lower limit of around 4.3 MeV of the sd-pf shell gap in $^{30}$Na.

demonstrate that the excess risk of empirical risk minimization (ERM) is
controlled by the preconditioned stability rate. This immediately yields a
relatively short and elegant proof for the fast rates attained by ERM in our

At the bulk level, excitations of the coupled light-matter system, or
polaritons, are described by a Proca-type equation for massive vector bosons.
On the microscopic level, multiple scattering is used to relate the sub-luminal
speed of the polaritons to the polarizability of the Lorentz oscillators. For
each direction of propagation of the polaritons, three independent
polarizations exist, consistent with the integer spin of massive vector bosons.
Reflection and refraction are calculated by imposing the requirement of a
uniform gauge for the electromagnetic vector potential across the interface of
the uniaxial molecular material and vacuum. Reflectance spectra near the
resonance frequency are calculated. The spectra feature a characteristic
minimum in middle of the reflection band, in agreement with experiment. An

superradiant systems made of an ensmble of two-level atoms interacting with a
single-mode radiation field at zero effective temperature, and address
estimation of the coupling by measurements performed only on radiation. At
first, we obtain analytically the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and show
that optimal estimation of the coupling may be achieved by tuning the frequency
of the radiation field to drive the system towards criticality. The scaling
behavior of the QFI at the critical point is obtained explicitly upon
exploiting the symplectic formalism for Gaussian states. We then analyze the
performances of feasible detection schemes performed only on the radiation
subsystem, namely homodyne detection and photon counting, and show that the
corresponding Fisher Informations (FIs) approach the global QFI in the critical
region. We thus conclude that criticality is a twofold resource. On the one
hand, global QFI diverges at the critical point, i.e. the coupling may be
estimated with the arbitrary precision. On the other hand, the FIs of feasible
local measurements, (which are generally smaller than the QFI out of the
critical region), show the same scaling of the global QFI, i.e. optimal
estimation of coupling may be achieved by locally probing the system, despite

recently been established for relativistic problems even though the discrete

the basic comparison theorem for the Dirac equation with spin and pseudo--spin

now cross each other in a prescribed manner implying that the energy values are
still ordered. The refined comparison theorems are valid for the ground state
in one dimension and for the bottom of an angular momentum subspace in $d>1$
dimensions. For instance in a simplest case in one dimension, the condition
$V_a\le V_b$ is replaced by $U_a\le U_b$, where $U_i(x)=\int_0^x V_i(t)dt$,

power consumption of programmable loads and reactive power outputs of
photovoltaic (PV) inverters in distribution networks. The premise is to
determine the optimal demand response schedule that accounts for the stochastic
availability of solar power, as well as to control the reactive power
generation or consumption of PV inverters adaptively to the real power
injections of all PV units. These uncertain real power injections by PV units
are modeled as random variables taking values from a finite number of possible
scenarios. Through the use of second order cone relaxation of the power flow
equations, a convex stochastic program is formulated. The objectives are to
minimize the negative user utility, cost of power provision, and thermal
losses, while constraining voltages to remain within specified levels. To find
the global optimum point, a decentralized algorithm is developed via the
alternating direction method of multipliers that results in closed-form updates
per node and per scenario, rendering it suitable to implement in distribution
networks with large number of scenarios. Numerical tests and comparisons with
an alternative deterministic approach are provided for typical residential
distribution networks that confirm the efficiency of the algorithm.

implementations of this kind of device have a higher movement time compared to
the mouse and trackpad due to large error rate, low speed and spatial
resolution. In this paper we introduce Keyboard Surface Interaction (KSI), an
interaction approach that turns the surface of a keyboard into an interaction
surface and allows users to rest their hands on the keyboard at all times to
minimize fatigue. We developed a proof-of-concept implementation, Fingers,
which we optimized over a series of studies. Finally, we evaluated Fingers
against the mouse and trackpad in a user study with 25 participants on a Fitts
law test style, mixed typing and pointing task. Results showed that for users
with more exposure to KSI, our KSI device had better performance (reduced
movement and homing time) and reduced discomfort compared to the trackpad. When
compared to the mouse, KSI had reduced homing time and reduced discomfort, but
increased movement time. This interaction approach is not only a new way to
capitalize on the space on top of the keyboard, but also a call to innovate and
think beyond the touchscreen, touchpad, and mouse as our main pointing devices.
The results of our studies serve as a specification for future KSI devices.

conjectured that flicker noise associated with FRB repetition could show up in
non-cataclysmic neutron star emission models, like supergiant pulses. We show
how the current limits of repetition would be significantly weakened if their
repeat rate really were non-Poissonian and had a pink or red spectrum.
Repetition and its statistics have implications for observing strategy,
generally favouring shallow wide-field surveys, since in the non-repeating
scenario survey depth is unimportant. We also discuss the statistics of the
apparent latitudinal dependence of FRBs, and offer a simple method for
calculating the significance of this effect. We provide a generalized Bayesian
framework for addressing this problem, which allows for direct model
comparison. It is shown how the evidence for a steep latitudinal gradient of
the FRB rate is less strong than initially suggested and simple explanations
like increased scattering and sky temperature in the plane are sufficient to
decrease the low-latitude burst rate, given current data. The reported dearth
of bursts near the plane is further complicated if FRBs have non-Poissonian
repetition, since in that case the event rate inferred from observation depends
on observing strategy.

of ~ 3.6 A high islands are observed by atomic force microscopy over
approximate 10% of the surface. Subsequently, patch growth stops, and oxidation
begins after the two hours and continues until one quintuple layer has been
oxidized. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows no sign of oxidation before ~
120 minutes of exposure to air, and the oxygen 1s peak is clearly present after
~ 190 minutes of ambient exposure. Variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry
also indicates that the oxidation of a full quintuple layer occurs on the time
scale of days. These results are in good agreement with the time dependent
changes previously observed in the surface crystal structure by second harmonic
generation. In addition to providing the ability to non-destructively measure
oxide on the surface of Bi2Se3 crystals, ellipsometry can be used to identify
the thickness of Bi2Se3 flakes. These results are consistent with non-linear

Kepler field, we present photometric (Kepler and ground-based BVRcIc) and
spectroscopic observations of the detached eclipsing binary WOCS 24009 (Auner
665; KIC 5023948) with a short orbital period of 3.6 days. WOCS 24009 is a
triple-lined system, and we verify that the brightest star is physically
orbiting the eclipsing binary using radial velocities and eclipse timing
variations. The eclipsing binary components have masses M_B =1.090+/-0.010 Msun
and M_C =1.075+/-0.013 Msun, and radii R_B =1.095+/-0.007 Rsun and R_C
=1.057+/-0.008 Rsun. The bright non-eclipsing star resides at the cluster
turnoff, and ultimately its mass will directly constrain the turnoff mass: our
preliminary determination is M_A =1.251+/-0.057 Msun. A careful examination of
the light curves indicates that the fainter star in the eclipsing binary
undergoes a very brief period of total eclipse, which enables us to precisely
decompose the light of the three stars and place them in the color-magnitude
diagram.
  We also present improved analysis of two previously discussed detached
eclipsing stars in NGC 6819 (WOCS 40007 and WOCS 23009) en route to a combined
determination of the cluster's distance modulus (m-M)_V=12.38+/-0.04. Because
this paper significantly increases the number of measured stars in the cluster,
we can better constrain the age of the color-magnitude diagram to be
2.21+/-0.10+/-0.20 Gyr. Additionally, using all measured eclipsing binary star
masses and radii, we constrain the age to 2.38+/-0.05+/-0.22 Gyr. The quoted
uncertainties are estimates of measurement and systematic uncertainties (due to
model physics differences and metal content), respectively.

Energy consumption considerations provide a driving force toward employing thin

atomically-thin materials that can exist in multiple crystal structures, each
with distinct electrical properties. Using density functional approaches, we
discover that electrostatic gating device configurations have the potential to
drive structural semiconductor-to-semimetal phase transitions in some monolayer
transition metal dichalcogenides. For the first time, we show that the
dynamical control of this phase transition can be achieved in carefully
designed electronic devices. We discover that the semiconductor-to-semimetal
phase transition in monolayer MoTe2 can be driven by a gate voltage of several
Volts with appropriate choice of dielectric. Structural transitions in
monolayer TaSe2 are predicted to occur under similar conditions. While the
required field magnitudes are large for these two materials, we find that the
gate voltage for the transition can be reduced arbitrarily by alloying, e.g.
for MoxW1-xTe2 monolayers. We have developed a method for computing phase
diagrams of monolayer materials with respect to charge and voltage, validated
by comparing to direct calculations and experimental measurements. Our findings
identify a new physical mechanism, not existing in bulk materials, to

place between the emerging and preexisting systems. However, those experiments
miss basic elements that can importantly affect the surge phenomenon. In this
paper we study the cool surges using a realistic treatment of the radiation
transfer and material plasma properties. To that end, the Bifrost code is used,
which has advanced modules for the equation of state of the plasma,
photospheric and chromospheric radiation transfer, heat conduction and
optically thin radiative cooling. We carry out a 2.5D experiment of the
emergence of magnetized plasma through (meso)granular convection cells and the
low atmosphere to the corona. Through detailed Lagrange tracing, we study the
formation and evolution of the cool ejection and, in particular, the role of
the entropy sources: this allows us to discern families of evolutionary

accelerations well in excess of gravity; when nearing the apex of their
individual trajectories, instead, the plasma elements follow quasi-parabolic
trajectories with acceleration close to g$_{\odot^{}}$. We show how the

and susceptibility curves evolve with increasing dissipation strength,
$\alpha$, from those of an isolated two-level system at vanishingly small
dissipation strength, with the characteristic activated-like behavior in this
limit, to those of the isotropic Kondo model in the limit $\alpha\to 1^{-}$.
For the transient dynamics of the two-level system, $P(t)=\langle
\sigma_{z}(t)\rangle$, with initial-state preparation $P(t\leq0)=+1$, we apply
the time-dependent extension of the NRG (TDNRG) to the interacting resonant

noninteracting-blip approximation (NIBA), the functional renormalization group
(FRG), and the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG).
We demonstrate excellent agreement on short to intermediate time scales between
TDNRG and TD-DMRG for $0\lesssim\alpha \lesssim 0.9$ for $P(t)$, and between
TDNRG and FRG in the vicinity of $\alpha=1/2$. Furthermore, we quantify the
error in the NIBA for a range of $\alpha$, finding significant errors in the
latter even for $0.1\leq \alpha\leq 0.4$. We also briefly discuss why the
long-time errors in the present formulation of the TDNRG prevents an

proton and electron temperatures of the solar wind. To study the evolution of
the solar wind, we specified three input model parameters, the plasma density,
Alfven wave amplitude and the strength of the dipole magnetic field at the wind

stable decomposition and strengthened Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, and
successfully applied to the saddle point systems arising from mixed finite
element methods for Poisson and Stokes equations. Uniform convergence is
obtained without the full regularity assumption of the underlying partial
differential equations. As a byproduct, a V-cycle multigrid method for
non-conforming finite elements is developed and proved to be uniform convergent
with even one smoothing step.

from the SDSS in large-scale cosmic voids on time scales of 10 Myr and 100 Myr,
using H$\alpha$ emission line strengths and GALEX FUV fluxes, respectively. The
first sample consists of 109,818 optically selected galaxies. We find that void
galaxies in this sample have higher specific star formation rates (SSFRs; star
formation rates per unit stellar mass) than similar stellar mass galaxies in
denser regions. The second sample is a subset of the optically selected sample
containing 8070 galaxies with reliable HI detections from ALFALFA. For the full
HI detected sample, SSFRs do not vary systematically with large-scale
environment. However, investigating only the HI detected dwarf galaxies reveals
a trend towards higher SSFRs in voids. Furthermore, we estimate the star
formation rate per unit HI mass (known as the star formation efficiency; SFE)
of a galaxy, as a function of environment. For the overall HI detected
population, we notice no environmental dependence. Limiting the sample to dwarf
galaxies again reveals a trend towards higher SFEs in voids. These results
suggest that void environments provide a nurturing environment for dwarf galaxy
evolution allowing for higher specific star formation rates and efficiencies.

distribution is shaped entirely by two factors - the reversion rates (a measure
of cross-sectional mean reversion) and idiosyncratic volatilities of wealth
across different ranked households. By estimating these factors, our model can
exactly match the U.S. wealth distribution. This provides information about the
current trajectory of inequality as well as estimates of the distributional
effects of progressive capital taxes. We find evidence that the U.S. wealth
distribution might be on a temporarily unstable trajectory, thus suggesting
that further increases in top wealth shares are likely in the near future. For

substantially reshapes the distribution of wealth and reduces inequality.

Considering these constraints together necessitates the design of novel schemes
to allocate steps to agents. In addition, large crowdsourcing systems require
allocation schemes that are simple, fast, decentralized and offer customers

numerical simulations to calibrate and compare models. Instead of computing
likelihood functions, Approximate Bayesian computation relies on numerical
simulations, which makes it applicable to complex models in ecology and
evolution. As usual for statistical modeling, evaluating goodness-of-fit is a
fundamental step for Approximate Bayesian Computation. Here, we introduce a
goodness-of-fit approach based on hypothesis-testing. We introduce two test
statistics based on the mean distance between numerical summaries of the data
and simulated ones. One test statistic relies on summaries simulated with the
prior predictive distribution whereas the other one relies on simulations from
the posterior predictive distribution. For different coalescent models, we find
that the statistics are well calibrated, meaning that the type I error can be
controlled. However, the statistical power of the two statistics is extremely
variable across models ranging from 20% to 100%. The difference of power
between the two statistics is negligible in models of demographic inference but
substantial in an additional and purely statistical example. When analyzing
resequencing data to evaluate models of human demography, the two statistics
confirm that an out-of-Africa bottleneck cannot be rejected for Asiatic and
European data. We also consider two speciation models in the context of a
butterfly species complex. One goodness-of-fit statistic indicates a poor fit
for both models, and the numerical summaries causing the poor fit were
identified using posterior predictive checks. Statistical tests for
goodness-of-fit should foster evaluation of model fit in Approximate Bayesian
Computation. The test statistic based on simulations from the prior predictive
distribution is implemented in the gfit function of the R abc package.

represent the implicit meaning of the data by specifying the concepts and the

automatically publish the data into knowledge graphs. Manually modeling the
semantics of data sources requires significant effort and expertise, and
although desirable, building these models automatically is a challenging
problem. Most of the related work focuses on semantic annotation of the data
fields (source attributes). However, constructing a semantic model that
explicitly describes the relationships between the attributes in addition to
their semantic types is critical.
  We present a novel approach that exploits the knowledge from a domain
ontology and the semantic models of previously modeled sources to automatically
learn a rich semantic model for a new source. This model represents the
semantics of the new source in terms of the concepts and relationships defined
by the domain ontology. Given some sample data from the new source, we leverage
the knowledge in the domain ontology and the known semantic models to construct
a weighted graph that represents the space of plausible semantic models for the
new source. Then, we compute the top k candidate semantic models and suggest to
the user a ranked list of the semantic models for the new source. The approach
takes into account user corrections to learn more accurate semantic models on

functions is needed because many electronic processes occur in excited states.
But since the excited energies are saddle points in the Hilbert space of wave
functions, the standard computational methods, based on orthogonality to lower
lying approximants, resort to huge and incomprehensible wave functions,
otherwise, the truncated wave function is veered away from the exact. The
presented variational principle for excited states, Fn, is demonstrated to lead
to the correct excited eigenfunction in necessarily small truncated spaces.
Using Hylleraas coordinates for He 1S 1s2s, the standard method based on the
theorem of Hylleraas - Unheim, and MacDonald, yields misleading main orbitals
1s1s' and needs a series expansion of 27 terms to be corrected, whereas
minimizing Fn goes directly to the corect main orbitals, 1s2s, and can be
adequately improved by 8 terms. Fn uses crude, rather inaccurate, lower lying
approximants and does not need orthogonality to them. This reduces
significantly the computation cost. Thus, having a correct 1st excited state
{\psi}1, a ground state approximant can be immediately improved toward an
orthogonal to psi_1 function. Also higher lying functions can be found that
have the energy of psi_1, but are orthogonal to psi_1. Fn can also recognize a
flipped root in avoided crossings: The excited state, either flipped or not,
has the smallest Fn. Thus, state average is unnecessary. The method is further
applied via conventional configuration interaction to the three lowest singlet

Additionally, the rate at which data are accrued will not allow traditional

is a strong imperative to discard uninteresting data in pseudo-real time. Here
we outline components of the SKA science analysis pipeline being developed to
produce a series of data products including continuum images, spectral cubes

reconstruct fiber tracts, for example, in muscle and white matter. Estimation
of fiber orientations (FOs) is a crucial step in the reconstruction process and
these estimates can be corrupted by noise. In this paper, a new method called
Fiber Orientation Reconstruction using Neighborhood Information (FORNI) is
described and shown to reduce the effects of noise and improve FO estimation
performance by incorporating spatial consistency. FORNI uses a fixed tensor
basis to model the diffusion weighted signals, which has the advantage of
providing an explicit relationship between the basis vectors and the FOs. FO
spatial coherence is encouraged using weighted l1-norm regularization terms,
which contain the interaction of directional information between neighbor
voxels. Data fidelity is encouraged using a squared error between the observed
and reconstructed diffusion weighted signals. After appropriate weighting of
these competing objectives, the resulting objective function is minimized using
a block coordinate descent algorithm, and a straightforward parallelization
strategy is used to speed up processing. Experiments were performed on a
digital crossing phantom, ex vivo tongue dMRI data, and in vivo brain dMRI data
for both qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The results demonstrate that
FORNI improves the quality of FO estimation over other state of the art
algorithms.

for a general system of quasilinear hyperbolic conservation laws with
uncertainty. The one-dimensional (1D) hyperbolic system is first symmetrized
with the aid of left eigenvector matrix of the Jacobian matrix. Stochastic
Galerkin method is then applied to derive the equations for the gPC expansion
coefficients. The resulting deterministic gPC Galerkin system is proved to be
symmetrically hyperbolic. This important property then allows one to use a
variety of numerical schemes for spatial and temporal discretization. Here a
higher-order and path-conservative finite volume WENO scheme is adopted in
space, along with a third-order total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta method
in time. The method is further extended to two-dimensional (2D) quasilinear
hyperbolic system with uncertainty, where the symmetric hyperbolicity of the
one-dimensional system is carried over via the operator splitting technique.
Several 1D and 2D numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed gPC stochastic Galerkin method.

constructed factor graph to perform iterative decoding. We use
\textit{traceback} to reduce the number of operations required for SP decoding
at sink node with general demands and obtain the number of operations required
for decoding using SP algorithm with and without traceback. For sinks demanding
all messages, we define \textit{fast decodability} of a network code and
identify a sufficient condition for the same. Next, we consider the in-network
function computation problem wherein the sink nodes do not demand the source
messages, but are only interested in computing a function of the messages. We
present an MPF formulation for function computation at the sink nodes in this
setting and use the SP algorithm to obtain the value of the demanded function.
The proposed method can be used for both linear and nonlinear as well as scalar
and vector codes for both decoding of messages in a network coding problem and
computing linear and nonlinear functions in an in-network function computation
problem.

minimization is sufficient (we name these Type B applications). Finally, we
discuss how four different strategies for achieving safety in engineering

causality of predictive models, objectives beyond expected prediction accuracy,
human involvement for labeling difficult or rare examples, and user experience

algorithm to solve the discrete logarithm problem in a group of prime order

In many collision search algorithms this complexity is achieved. So with
generic algorithms one can only hope to make the $k$ smaller. This $k$ depends
on the complexity of the iterative step in the generic algorithms. The
$\sqrt{N}$ comes from the fact there is about $\sqrt{N}$ iterations before a
collision. So if we can find ways that can reduce the amount of work in one
iteration then that is of great interest and probably the only possible
modification of a generic algorithm. The modified $r$-adding walk allegedly
does just that. It claims to reduce the amount of work done in one iteration of
the original $r$-adding walk. In this paper we study this modified $r$-adding

minimalist features that allow seamless communication between users. As the
conversations grew thick and faster, a placeholder feature called as Hashtags
became important as it captured the themes behind the tweets. Prior studies
have investigated the conversation dynamics, inter-play with other media
platforms and communication patterns between users for specific event-based
hashtags such as the #Occupy movement. Commonplace hashtags which are used on a
daily basis have been largely ignored due to their seemingly innocuous presence
in tweets and also due to the lack of connection with real-world events.
However, it can be postulated that utility of these hashtags is the main reason
behind their continued usage. This study is aimed at understanding the
rationale behind the usage of a particular type of commonplace hashtags -
location hashtags such as country and city name hashtags. Tweets with the
hashtag #singapore were extracted for one week duration. Manual and automatic
tweet classification was performed along with social network analysis, to
identify the underlying themes. Seven themes were identified. Findings indicate
that the hashtag is prominent in tweets about local events, local news, users
current location and landmark related information sharing. Users who share
content from social media sites such as Instagram make use of the hashtag in a
more prominent way when compared to users who post textual content. News
agencies, commercial bodies and celebrities make use of the hashtag more than
common individuals. Overall, the results show the non-conversational nature of
the hashtag. The findings are to be validated with other country names and
cross-validated with hashtag data from other social media platforms.

of semilinear elliptic variational inequalities with Neumann boundary
conditions. Sensitivity estimates and material derivatives are firstly derived
in an abstract operator setting where the operators are defined on polyhedral
subsets of reflexive Banach spaces. The results are then refined for
variational inequalities arising from minimisation problems for certain convex
energy functionals considered over upper obstacle sets in $H^1$. One
particularity is that we allow for dynamic obstacle functions which may arise
from another optimisation problems. We prove a strong convergence property for
the material derivative and establish state-shape derivatives under regularity
assumptions. Finally, as a concrete application from continuum mechanics, we
show how the dynamic obstacle case can be used to treat shape optimisation
problems for time-discretised brittle damage models for elastic solids. We
derive a necessary optimality system for optimal shapes whose state variables
approximate desired damage patterns and/or displacement fields.

$142^\circ\sim154^\circ$. The former can overlap mostly with one of allowed
angle regions extracted from the decay $B^{0}\to \bar D_{0}f_0(500)$. The
branching fractions of $B_s$ decay modes are less sensitive to the mixing angle
compared with those of B decay modes. Especially, for the decay $B_{s}\to D^0
f_0(980)$, its branching fraction changes only slightly between
$(1.2\sim1.8)\times10^{-7}$ when the mixing angle $\theta$ runs from $0^\circ$

dominated by two quark component in the B decay dynamic mechanism. Furthermore,
the $s\bar s$ component is more important than the $q\bar q=(u\bar u+d\bar

While proceeding in various stages, we develop an algebraic method to keep
track of the transseries' coefficients. We explore what conditions must be
violated in order to stay clear of fixed point theorems to eschew a unique
solution, if so desired, as we explain. An interesting find is that the flow of
data between the different sectors of the transseries shows a pattern typical
of resurgence, ie the phenomenon that the perturbative sector of the
transseries talks to the nonperturbative ones in a one-way fashion. However,
our ansatz is not exotic enough as it leads to trivial solutions with vanishing
nonperturbative sectors, even when logarithmic monomials are included. We see
our result as a harbinger of what future work might reveal about the
transseries representations of observables in fully renormalised
four-dimensional quantum field theories and adduce a tentative yet to our mind
weighty argument as to why one should not expect otherwise.

Fisher vector coding (FVC) has been identified as an effective coding method
for image classification. Most, if not all, FVC implementations employ the
Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to depict the generation process of local
features. However, the representative power of the GMM could be limited because
it essentially assumes that local features can be characterized by a fixed
number of feature prototypes and the number of prototypes is usually small in
FVC. To handle this limitation, in this paper we break the convention which
assumes that a local feature is drawn from one of few Gaussian distributions.
Instead, we adopt a compositional mechanism which assumes that a local feature
is drawn from a Gaussian distribution whose mean vector is composed as the
linear combination of multiple key components and the combination weight is a
latent random variable. In this way, we can greatly enhance the representative
power of the generative model of FVC. To implement our idea, we designed two
particular generative models with such a compositional mechanism.

$\sim$ TeV. Furthermore, we can combine these limits on the energy dependence

this absolute bound on $\gamma$ can be extended from optical to TeV energies.

nature. Inspired by the scientific advances in the human visual perception and
neuroaesthetics, we design Brain-Inspired Deep Networks (BDN) for this task.
BDN first learns attributes through the parallel supervised pathways, on a
variety of selected feature dimensions. A high-level synthesis network is
trained to associate and transform those attributes into the overall aesthetics
rating. We then extend BDN to predicting the distribution of human ratings,
since aesthetics ratings are often subjective. Another highlight is our
first-of-its-kind study of label-preserving transformations in the context of
aesthetics assessment, which leads to an effective data augmentation approach.
Experimental results on the AVA dataset show that our biological inspired and
task-specific BDN model gains significantly performance improvement, compared
to other state-of-the-art models with the same or higher parameter capacity.

spintronics is investigated. Although, these are generally gauge-fixed models,
it is found that for the class of gauge fields that are space-time independent
and satisfy a U(1) algebra, thus having a vanishing field strength, there is a
residual gauge freedom in the Hamiltonian. The gauge transformations assume the
form of a space-dependent rotation of the transformed wave functions with
rotation angles and axes determined by the specific form of the gauge-field,
i.e., the spin-orbit coupling. The fields can be gauged away, reducing the
Hamiltonian to one which is isospectral to the free-particle Hamiltonian, and
giving rise to the phenomenon of persistent spin helix reported first by
B.~A.~Bernevig \emph{et al.} [Phys.~Rev.~Lett. \textbf{97}, 236601 (2006)]. The
investigation of the global gauge transformations leads to the derivation of a
continuity equation where the component of the spin-density along given

Hungarian algorithm can all be viewed as the primal-dual method applied to the
linear programming formulations of their respective optimization problems.
Roughly speaking, successfully applying the primal-dual method to an
optimization problem that can be posed as a linear program relies on the
ability to find a simple characterization of the optimal solutions to a related
linear program, called the `dual of the restricted primal' (DRP).
  This paper is motivated by the following question: What is the algorithm we
obtain if we apply the primal-dual method to a linear programming formulation
of a discounted cost Markov decision process? We will first show that several
widely-used algorithms for Markov decision processes can be interpreted in
terms of the primal-dual method, where the value function is updated with
suboptimal solutions to the DRP in each iteration. We then provide the optimal
solution to the DRP in closed-form, and present the algorithm that results when
using this solution to update the value function in each iteration. Unlike the
algorithms obtained from suboptimal DRP updates, this algorithm is guaranteed
to yield the optimal value function in a finite number of iterations. Finally,
we show that the iterations of the primal-dual algorithm can be interpreted as
repeated application of the policy iteration algorithm to a special class of
Markov decision processes. When considered alongside recent results
characterizing the computational complexity of the policy iteration algorithm,
this observation could provide new insights into the computational complexity
of solving discounted-cost Markov decision processes.

interesting, yet puzzling, phenomenon of co-non-solvency. Co-non-solvency
occurs when two competing good solvents for PNIPAm, such as water and alcohol,
are mixed together. As a result, the same PNIPAm collapses within intermediate
mixing ratios. This complex conformational transition is driven by preferential
binding of methanol with PNIPAm. Interestingly, co-non-solvency can be
destroyed when applying high hydrostatic pressures. In this work, using a large
scale molecular dynamics simulation employing high pressures, we propose a
microscopic picture behind the suppression of the co-non-solvency phenomenon.
Based on thermodynamic and structural analysis, our results suggest that the
preferential binding of methanol with PNIPAm gets partially lost at high
pressures, making the background fluid reasonably homogeneous for the polymer.
This is consistent with the hypothesis that the co-non-solvency phenomenon is
driven by preferential binding and is not based on depletion effects.

the core of massive neutron stars. We investigate the quark deconfinement phase
transition in cold (T = 0) and hot beta-stable hadronic matter. Assuming a
first order phase transition, we calculate and compare the nucleation rate and
the nucleation time due to quantum and thermal nucleation mechanisms. We show
that above a threshold value of the central pressure a pure hadronic star (HS)
(i.e. a compact star with no fraction of deconfined quark matter) is metastable
to the conversion to a quark star (QS) (i.e. a hybrid star or a strange star).
This process liberates an enormous amount of energy, of the order of
10^{53}~erg, which causes a powerful neutrino burst, likely accompanied by
intense gravitational waves emission, and possibly by a second delayed (with
respect to the supernova explosion forming the HS) explosion which could be the
energy source of a powerful gamma-ray burst (GRB). This stellar conversion
process populates the QS branch of compact stars, thus one has in the Universe
two coexisting families of compact stars: pure hadronic stars and quark stars.
We introduce the concept of critical mass M_{cr} for cold HSs and
proto-hadronic stars (PHSs), and the concept of limiting conversion temperature
for PHSs. We show that PHSs with a mass M < M_{cr} could survive the early
stages of their evolution without decaying to QSs. Finally, we discuss the
possible evolutionary paths of proto-hadronic stars.

forward scattering and factorization violation as part of the soft-collinear
effective field theory (SCET) for high energy scattering. These phenomena are
mediated by long distance Glauber gluon exchanges, which are static in time,
localized in the longitudinal distance, where $|t| \ll s$. In hard scattering,
Glauber gluons can induce corrections which invalidate factorization. With
SCET, Glauber exchange graphs can be calculated explicitly, and are distinct
from graphs with soft, collinear, or ultrasoft gluons. We derive a complete
basis of operators which describe the leading power effects of Glauber
exchange. Key ingredients include regulating light-cone rapidity singularities
and subtractions which prevent double counting. Our results include a novel all
orders gauge invariant pure glue soft operator which appears between two
collinear rapidity sectors. The 1-gluon Feynman rule for the soft operator
coincides with the Lipatov vertex, but it also contributes to emissions with
$\ge 2$ soft gluons. Our Glauber operator basis is derived using tree level and
one-loop matching calculations from full QCD to SCET. The rapidity RGE yields
gluon Reggeization at the amplitude level, and gives the BFKL equation for the
soft and collinear functions in the forward scattering cross section. We derive
an explicit rule for when eikonalization is valid, and provide a direct
connection to the picture of multiple Wilson lines crossing a shockwave. In
hard scattering operators Glauber subtractions for soft and collinear loop
diagrams ensure that we are not sensitive to the directions for soft and
collinear Wilson lines. Conversely, certain Glauber interactions can be
absorbed into these soft and collinear Wilson lines by taking them to be in
specific directions. We also discuss criteria for factorization violation.

this formula is susceptible to quantum gravity corrections, one may hope that
these corrections could be inherited by the Newton's law. In this way, the
entropic interpretation of Newton's law could be a prolific way in order to get
verifiable or falsifiable quantum corrections to ordinary gravity in an
observationally accessible regimes. Loop quantum gravity is a theory that
provide a way to approach the quantum properties of spacetime. From this
theory, emerges a quantum corrected semiclassical black hole solution called
loop quantum black holes or self-dual black holes. Among the interesting
features of loop quantum black holes is the fact that they give rise to a
modified entropy-area relation where quantum gravity corrections are present.
In this work, we obtain the quantum corrected Newton's law from the
