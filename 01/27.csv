non-Hermitian Hamiltonian framework. Analytical expressions are derived for the
band structure of the isolated wire. Quantum states and transport properties of
the wire coupled to two ideal leads at the edges are studied in detail. The
width distribution of the quasistationary states varies as a function of the
coupling strength to the environment. At weak coupling, all the eigenenergies
uniformly acquire small widths. The picture changes entirely at strong
coupling, a certain number of states (""super-radiant"") are greatly broadened,
while the rest remain long-lived states, a pure quantum mechanical effect as a
consequence of quantum interference. The transition between the two regimes
greatly influences the transport properties of the system. The maximum
transmission through the wire occurs at the super-radiance transition. We
consider also a realistic situation with energy-dependent coupling to the
continuum due to the existence of decay threshold where super-radiance still
plays a significant role in transport properties of the system.

shotgun sequencing, where many randomly located fragments, called reads, are
extracted from the overall sequence, followed by an assembly algorithm that
aims to reconstruct the original sequence. There are many different
technologies that generate the reads: widely-used second-generation methods
create short reads with low error rates, while emerging third-generation
methods create long reads with high error rates. Both error rates and error
profiles differ among methods, so reconstruction algorithms are often tailored
to specific shotgun sequencing technologies. As these methods change over time,
a fundamental question is whether there exist reconstruction algorithms which
are robust, i.e., which perform well under a wide range of error distributions.
  Here we study this question of sequence assembly from corrupted reads. We
make no assumption on the types of errors in the reads, but only assume a bound
on their magnitude. More precisely, for each read we assume that instead of
receiving the true read with no errors, we receive a corrupted read which has
edit distance at most $\epsilon$ times the length of the read from the true
read. We show that if the reads are long enough and there are sufficiently many
of them, then approximate reconstruction is possible: we construct a simple
algorithm such that for almost all original sequences the output of the
algorithm is a sequence whose edit distance from the original one is at most
$O(\epsilon)$ times the length of the original sequence.

of the number of columns in the signal matrix, the sparsity (k) plus one
measurements is sufficient for the uniform recovery of signal vectors for
almost all signals, i.e., excluding a set of Lebesgue measure zero. To approach
the ""k+1"" lower bound with computational efficiency even when the rank of
signal matrix is smaller than k, we propose a greedy algorithm called Two-stage
orthogonal Subspace Matching Pursuit (TSMP) whose theoretical results approach
the lower bound with less restriction than the Orthogonal Subspace Matching
Pursuit (OSMP) and Subspace-Augmented MUltiple SIgnal Classification (SA-MUSIC)
algorithms. We provide non-asymptotical performance guarantees of OSMP and TSMP
by covering both noiseless and noisy cases. Variants of restricted isometry
property and mutual coherence are used to improve the performance guarantees.
Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme has low complexity
and outperforms most existing greedy methods. This shows that the minimum
number of measurements for the success of TSMP converges more rapidly to the
lower bound than the existing methods as the number of columns of the signal
matrix increases.

the metamaterial we experimentally show that close to the Epsilon-Equal-to-Zero

the optical power. Remarkably, this transition is linear as a function of pump
power and occurs on time scales of the order of the 100 fs pump pulse that need
not be tuned to a specific wavelength. The linearity of the permittivity
increase allows us to express the response of the metamaterial in terms of a
standard third order optical nonlinearity: this shows a clear inversion of the
roles of the real and imaginary parts in crossing the EEZ wavelength, further
supporting an optically induced change in the physical behaviour of the

system coordinators update the coordinating signals based on the physical

respectively. We undertake a Shannon theoretic study and focus on
achievability, i.e., characterizing sufficient conditions. In the absence of a
Ga\'cs-K\""orner-Witsenhausen common part, the current known single-letter (S-L)
coding schemes are constrained to the S-L long Markov Chain (LMC)
$X_{1}-S_{1}-S_{2}-X_{2}$. Taking the lead of Dueck's example [Dueck, Mar
1981], we recognize that the latter constraint is debilitating, leading to
sub-optimality of S-L coding schemes. The goal of our work is to design a
coding scheme wherein (i) the choice of channel input at time $t$ is based on
multiple source symbols, and is yet ii) amenable to performance
characterization via S-L expressions. In this article, we present the first
part of our findings. We propose a new separation-based coding scheme based on
a fixed block-length (B-L) codes that enables choice of $X_{jt}$ - the symbol
input on the channel by encoder $j$ at time $t$ - to be based on a generic
number $l$ of source symbols $S_{j}^{l}$, thus permitting correlation of the
input symbols $X_{1},X_{2}$ through a multi-letter LMC
$X_{1}-S_{1}^{l}-S_{2}^{l}-X_{2}$. By carefully stitching together S-L coding
techniques we devise a multi-letter coding scheme. We characterize an inner
bound to its performance via a S-L expression and prove that the derived inner
bound is strictly larger than the current known largest inner bounds for both
the MAC and IC problems based on S-L coding schemes. In the second part of our
work, we propose to enlarge the inner bound derived in this article by
incorporating the technique of inducing source correlation onto channel inputs

where terahertz or microwave fields are coherently converted into optical
fields and vice versa. This process is made possible by the long lifetime of
Rydberg states, the strong coupling of millimeter waves to Rydberg transitions
and by a quantum interference effect related to electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT). Our frequency conversion scheme applies to a broad spectrum
of millimeter waves due to the abundance of transitions within the Rydberg
manifold, and we discuss two possible implementations based on focussed
terahertz beams and millimeter wave fields confined by a waveguide,
respectively. We analyse a realistic example for the interconversion of
terahertz and optical fields in rubidium atoms and find that the conversion
efficiency can in principle exceed 90\%.

  for Mobile Payments","19 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Near Field Communication (NFC) has enabled mobile phones to emulate
contactless smart cards. Similar to contactless smart cards, they are also
susceptible to relay attacks. To counter these, a number of methods have been
proposed that rely primarily on ambient sensors as a proximity detection
mechanism (also known as an anti-relay mechanism). In this paper, we, for the
first time in academic literature, empirically evaluate a comprehensive set of
ambient sensors for their effectiveness as a proximity detection mechanism. We
selected 15 out of a total of 17 sensors available via the Google Android
platform for evaluation, with the other two sensors unavailable on widely-used
handsets. In existing academic literature, only 5 sensors have been proposed
with positive results as a potential proximity detection mechanism. Each
sensor, where feasible, was used to record the measurements of 1000 contactless
transactions at four different physical locations. A total of 252 random users,
random sample of the university student population, were involved during the
field trails. The analysis of these transactions provides an empirical
foundation to categorically answer whether ambient sensors provide a strong
proximity detection mechanism for security sensitive applications like banking,
transport and high-security access control. After careful analysis, we conclude
that no single evaluated mobile ambient sensor is suitable for such critical
applications in realistic deployment scenarios. Lastly, we identify a number of
potential avenues that may improve their effectiveness.

a challenging issue in the large networks. Identifying the most influential

networks. A lot of research is done to devise centrality measures which could
efficiently identify the most influential nodes in the network. There are two
major approaches to the problem: On one hand, deterministic strategies that
exploit knowledge about the overall network topology in order to find the
influential nodes, while on the other end, random strategies are completely
agnostic about the network structure. Centrality measures that can deal with a
limited knowledge of the network structure are required. Indeed, in practice,
information about the global structure of the overall network is rarely
available or hard to acquire. Even if available, the structure of the network
might be too large that it is too much computationally expensive to calculate
global centrality measures. To that end, a centrality measure is proposed that
requires information only at the community level to identify the influential
nodes in the network. Indeed, most of the real-world networks exhibit a
community structure that can be exploited efficiently to discover the
influential nodes. We performed a comparative evaluation of prominent global
deterministic strategies together with stochastic strategies with an available
and the proposed deterministic community-based strategy. Effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated by performing experiments on synthetic and
real-world networks with community structure in the case of immunization of
nodes for epidemic control.

the identification of a counterpart resides in the capability of obtaining an
accurate enough sky localisation with eLISA. This seriously challenges the
capability of four-link (2 arm) configurations to successfully constrain the
cosmological parameters. Conversely, six-link (3 arm) configurations have the
potential to provide a test of the expansion of the universe up to $z\sim 8$
which is complementary to other cosmological probes based on electromagnetic
observations only. In particular, in the most favourable scenarios, they can
provide a significant constraint on $H_0$ at the level of 0.5%. Furthermore,
$(\Omega_M, \Omega_\Lambda)$ can be constrained to a level competitive with
present SNIa results. On the other hand, the lack of massive black hole binary
standard sirens at low redshift allows to constrain dark energy only at the
level of few percent.

$\Phi:\mathcal H\to\mathbb R$ is a smooth convex function acting on a real
Hilbert space $\mathcal H$, and $\alpha$, $\beta$ are positive parameters. This
inertial system combines an isotropic viscous damping which vanishes
asymptotically, and a geometrical Hessian driven damping, which makes it
naturally related to Newton's and Levenberg-Marquardt methods. For $\alpha\geq
3$, $\beta >0$, along any trajectory, fast convergence of the values
$$\Phi(x(t))- \min_{\mathcal H}\Phi =\mathcal O\left(t^{-2}\right)$$ is
obtained, together with rapid convergence of the gradients $\nabla\Phi(x(t))$
to zero. For $\alpha>3$, just assuming that $\Phi$ has minimizers, we show that
any trajectory converges weakly to a minimizer of $\Phi$, and $
\Phi(x(t))-\min_{\mathcal H}\Phi = o(t^{-2})$. Strong convergence is
established in various practical situations. For the strongly convex case,
convergence can be arbitrarily fast depending on the choice of $\alpha$. More
precisely, we have $\Phi(x(t))- \min_{\mathcal H}\Phi = \mathcal
O(t^{-\frac{2}{3}\alpha})$. We extend the results to the case of a general
proper lower-semicontinuous convex function $\Phi : \mathcal H \rightarrow
\mathbb R \cup \{+\infty \}$. This is based on the fact that the inertial
dynamic with Hessian driven damping can be written as a first-order system in
time and space. By explicit-implicit time discretization, this opens a gate to
new $-$ possibly more rapid $-$ inertial algorithms, expanding the field of
FISTA methods for convex structured optimization problems.

gels and provide a theoretical framework that quantitatively predicts the
migration velocity of the droplets. Remarkably, we find that while on thick
substrates the interaction is purely attractive and leads to drop-drop
coalescence, for relatively thin substrates a short-range repulsion occurs
which prevents the two drops from coming into direct contact. This versatile,
new interaction is the liquid-on-solid analogue of the ""Cheerios effect"". The
effect will strongly influence the condensation and coarsening of drop soft
polymer films, and has potential implications for colloidal assembly and in
mechanobiology.

where the populations can be subject to non-Markov noise for arbitrary

different disciplines that traditionally have had limited interaction:
computational neuroscience and the theory of random networks. The method uses a
geometric binning scheme, based on the method of characteristics, to capture
the deterministic neurodynamics of the population, separating the deterministic
and stochastic process cleanly. We can independently vary the choice of the
deterministic model and the model for the stochastic process, leading to a
highly modular numerical solution strategy. We demonstrate this by replacing
the Master equation implicit in many formulations of the PDE formalism, by a
generalization called the generalized Montroll-Weiss equation - a recent result
from random network theory - describing a random walker subject to transitions
realized by a non-Markovian process. We demonstrate the method for leaky- (LIF)

Poisson and gamma distributed spike intervals. We are able to model jump
responses for both models accurately to both excitatory and inhibitory input

to explain the presence of distributions other than the Boltzmann-Gibbs
distributions in Nature, typically power-law behavior, for systems out of
equilibrium such as fluids under turbulence, plasmas and gravitational systems.
  Superstatistics postulates that those systems are found in a superposition of
canonical ensembles at different temperatures. The usual interpretation is one
of local thermal equilibrium (LTE) in the sense of an inhomogeneous temperature
distribution in different regions of space or instants of time. Here we show
that, in order for superstatistics to be internally consistent, it is
impossible to define a phase-space function or observable $B(p, q)$
corresponding one-to-one to the local value of $\beta=1/k_B T$. Temperature
then belongs to a different class of observables than the energy, which has as
a phase-space function the Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}(p, q)$.
  An important consequence of our proof is that, in Superstatistics, the
identification of temperature with the kinetic energy is limited to the
expectation of $\beta$ and cannot be used to measure the different temperatures
in LTE or its fluctuations.

definition of graphons as functions over probability spaces to functions over
$\sigma$-finite measure spaces, we can model a large family of exchangeable
graphs, including the Caron-Fox graphs and the traditional exchangeable dense
graphs as special cases. Explicitly, modelling the underlying space of features
by a $\sigma$-finite measure space $(S,\mathcal{S},\mu)$ and the connection
probabilities by an integrable function $W\colon S\times S\to [0,1]$, we
construct a random family $(G_t)_{t\geq 0}$ of growing graphs such that the
vertices of $G_t$ are given by a Poisson point process on $S$ with intensity
$t\mu$, with two points $x,y$ of the point process connected with probability
$W(x,y)$. We call such a random family a graphon process. We prove that a
graphon process has convergent subgraph frequencies (with possibly infinite
limits) and that, in the natural extension of the cut metric to our setting,
the sequence converges to the generating graphon. We also show that the
underlying graphon is identifiable only as an equivalence class over graphons
with cut distance zero. More generally, we study metric convergence for
arbitrary (not necessarily random) sequences of graphs, and show that a
sequence of graphs has a convergent subsequence if and only if it has a
subsequence satisfying a property we call uniform regularity of tails. Finally,
we prove that every graphon is equivalent to a graphon on $\mathbb{R}_+$

two-ended cylinder stabilizers. The second is that every factor in their JSJ
decompositions is either `relatively rigid' or `hanging'. Hyperbolic groups
always satisfy the first condition, and it is an open question whether they
always satisfy the second.
  The same methods also produce invariants that reduce the problem of
classification of one-ended hyperbolic groups up to homeomorphism of their
Gromov boundaries to the problem of classification of the factors of their JSJ

dynamic interaction of parcels of wind with different speed. For instance, the
T-V relationship steepens, as the range in V is limited more than the range in
T with distance. At times the T-V correlation clearly breaks down beyond 20 AU,
which may indicate wind currently expanding and cooling may have an elevated T
reflecting prior heating and compression in the inner heliosphere. The power of

field iteration for the electron density in the ACE formulation is only
marginally larger than that of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
calculation, and thus offers orders of magnitude speedup for Hartree-Fock-like
calculations.

a slight generalization of this usual model---from linear to convex ""perceived""
payments. This more general problem does not appear to admit a solution as
simple and elegant as Myerson's.
  While some of Myerson's results extend to our setting, like his payment
formula (suitably adjusted), others do not. For example, we observe that the
solutions to the Bayesian and the robust (i.e., non-Bayesian) optimal auction
design problems in the convex perceived payment setting do not coincide like
they do in the case of linear payments. We therefore study the two problems in
turn.
  We derive an upper and a heuristic lower bound on expected revenue in our
setting. These bounds are easily computed pointwise, and yield monotonic
allocation rules, so can be supported by Myerson payments (suitably adjusted).
In this way, our bounds yield heuristics that approximate the optimal robust
auction, assuming convex perceived payments.
  We close with experiments, the final set of which massages the output of one
of the closed-form heuristics for the robust problem into an extremely fast,

significant blue or red line asymmetries in optically-thick emission indicative
of collapsing or expanding motions, respectively. We separately fit the HCO+
profiles with an analytic collapse model and determine contraction (expansion)
speeds toward 22 cores. Comparing the $\delta_v$ and collapse model results, we
find that $\delta_v$ is a good tracer of core contraction if the optically-thin
emission is aligned with the model-derived systemic velocity. The contraction
speeds range from subsonic (0.03 km/s) to supersonic (0.4 km/s), where the
supersonic contraction speeds may trace global rather than local core
contraction. Most cores have contraction speeds significantly less than their
free-fall speeds. Only 7 of 28 starless cores have spectra well-fit by the
collapse model, which more than doubles (15 of 28) for protostellar cores.
Starless cores with masses greater than the Jeans mass (M/M$_J$ > 1) are
somewhat more likely to show contraction motions. We find no trend of
optically-thin non-thermal line width with M/M$_J$, suggesting that any
undetected contraction motions are small and subsonic. Most starless cores in
Perseus are either not in a state of collapse or expansion, or are in a very

35(\text{stat})\pm 31$ (syst) parts per billion (ppb). This asymmetry, along
with other data from parity-violating electron scattering experiments, provided
the world's first determination of the weak charge of the proton. The weak
charge of the proton was found to be $Q_W^p=0.064\pm0.012$, in agreement with
the Standard Model prediction of $Q_W^p(SM)=0.0708\pm0.0003$.
  The results of the full dataset are expected to decrease the statistical
error from the initial publication by a factor of 4-5. The level of precision
of the final result makes it a useful test of Standard Model predictions and
particularly of the ""running"" of $\sin^2\theta_W$ from the Z-mass to low
energies. This thesis focuses on reduction of systematic error in two key
systematics for the Qweak experiment. First, techniques for measuring and
removing false asymmetries arising from helicity-correlated electron beam
properties at the few ppb level are discussed. Second, as a parity-violating
experiment, Qweak relies on accurate knowledge of electron beam polarimetry. To
help address the requirement of accurate polarimetry, a Compton polarimeter
built specifically for Qweak. Compton polarimetry requires accurate knowledge
of laser polarization inside a Fabry-Perot cavity enclosed in the electron beam
pipe. A new technique was developed for Qweak that nearly eliminates this
systematic error.

eccentricity and orientation (i.e., inclination) oscillations. The orbits'
eccentricity can reach extreme values leading to a nearly radial motion, which

the orbits' mutual inclination may change dramatically from pure prograde to
pure retrograde leading to misalignment and a wide range of inclinations. This

models in order to look for SED differences that depend on the Eddington ratio.
The fitting takes into account measured BH mass and accretion rates, BH spin
and intrinsic reddening of the sources. All objects in both groups can be
fitted by thin AD models over the range 0.2-1$\,\mu$m with reddening as a free
parameter. The intrinsic reddening required to fit the data are relatively
small, $E(B-V)\leq0.2$~mag, except for one source. Super-Eddington AGN seem to
require more reddening. The distribution of $E(B-V)$ is similar to what is
observed in larger AGN samples. The best fit disc models recover very well the
BH mass and accretion for the two groups. However, the SEDs are very different,
with super-Eddington sources requiring much more luminous far-UV continuum. The
exact amount depends on the possible saturation of the UV radiation in slim
discs. In particular, we derive for the super-Eddington sources a typical
bolometric correction at 5100\AA{} of 60-150 compared with a median of $\sim$20
for the sub-Eddington AGN. The measured torus luminosity relative to $\lambda
L_{\lambda}(5100\AA{}$) are similar in both groups. The $\alpha_{OX}$
distribution is similar too. However, we find extremely small torus covering
factors for super-Eddington sources, an order of magnitude smaller than those
of sub-Eddington AGN. The small differences between the groups regarding the
spectral range 0.2-22$\,\mu$m, and the significant differences related to the
part of the SED that we cannot observed may be consistent with some slim disc
models. An alternative explanation is that present day slim-disc models
over-estimate the far UV luminosity of such objects by a large amount.

Borexino has also set the most stringent limit on CNO energy generation, only

the median combination of point spread function (PSF) homogenized, overlapping
single epoch images. Transient artifacts are detected and masked in each single
epoch image through comparison with an artifact free, PSF-matched simulated
image that is constructed using the PSF-corrected, model fitting catalog from
the artifact free coadd image together with the position variable PSF model of
the single epoch image. This approach works well not only for cleaning single
epoch images with worse seeing than the PSF homogenized coadd, but also the
traditionally much more challenging problem of cleaning single epoch images
with better seeing. In addition to masking transient artifacts, we have
developed an interpolation approach that uses the local PSF and performs well
in removing artifacts whose widths are smaller than the PSF full width at half
maximum, including cosmic rays, the peaks of saturated stars and bleed trails.

duality defects and their branching, and prove they are topological. One useful
consequence is a simple implementation of Kramers-Wannier duality on the torus

topological defects to do simple calculations that yield exact properties of

the conformal spin 1/16 of the chiral spin field. Even more strikingly, we

galactic nuclei and contrast it to SF in extended discs. In galactic nuclei the
dynamical time becomes shorter than the time over which feedback from young
stars evolves. We argue analytically that the balance between stellar feedback
and gravity is unstable in this regime. We study this using numerical
simulations with pc-scale resolution and explicit stellar feedback taken from
stellar evolution models. The nuclear gas mass, young stellar mass, and SFR
within the central ~100 pc (the short-timescale regime) never reach
steady-state, but instead go through dramatic, oscillatory cycles. Stars form
until a critical surface density of young stars is present (such that feedback
overwhelms gravity), at which point they begin to expel gas from the nucleus.
Since the dynamical times are shorter than the stellar evolution times, the
stars do not die as the gas is expelled, but continue to push, triggering a
runaway quenching of star formation in the nucleus. However the expelled gas is
largely not unbound from the galaxy, but goes into a galactic fountain which
re-fills the nuclear region after the massive stars from the previous burst
cycle have died off (~50 Myr timescale). On large scales (>1 kpc), the
galaxy-scale gas content and SFR is more stable. We examine the consequences of
this episodic nuclear star formation for the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation:
while a tight KS relation exists on ~1 kpc scales in good agreement with
observations, the scatter increases dramatically in smaller apertures centered
on galactic nuclei.

range M_h~2x10^12-10^13 Msun at z=2. This extends our previous analysis of the
circum-galactic medium of high-redshift galaxies to more massive halos. AGN
feedback is not included in these simulations. We find Lyman limit system
covering fractions consistent with those observed around quasars. The large HI
covering fractions arise from star formation-driven galactic winds, including
winds from low-mass satellite galaxies that interact with cosmological
filaments. We show that it is necessary to resolve these satellite galaxies and
their winds to reproduce the large Lyman limit system covering fractions
observed in quasar-mass halos. Our simulations predict that galaxies occupying
dark matter halos of mass similar to quasars but without a luminous AGN should
have Lyman limit system covering fractions comparable to quasars.

of an effective positive interaction between long coding or non-coding RNA
molecules, carrying significant potential implications for a variety of
biological processes. Here, inspired by recent work providing a quantitative
description of small regulatory elements as information-conveying channels, we
characterize the effectiveness of miRNA-mediated regulation in terms of the
optimal information flow achievable between modulator (transcription factors)
and target nodes (long RNAs). Our findings show that, while a sufficiently
large degree of target derepression is needed to activate miRNA-mediated
transmission, (a) in case of differential mechanisms of complex processing
and/or transcriptional capabilities, regulation by a post-transcriptional
miRNA-channel can outperform that achieved through direct transcriptional
control; moreover, (b) in the presence of large populations of weakly
interacting miRNA molecules the extra noise coming from titration disappears,
allowing the miRNA-channel to process information as effectively as the direct
channel. These observations establish the limits of miRNA-mediated
post-transcriptional cross-talk and suggest that, besides providing a degree of
noise buffering, this type of control may be effectively employed in cells both
as a failsafe mechanism and as a preferential fine tuner of gene expression,
pointing to the specific situations in which each of these functionalities is
maximized.

expected from the In content measured by x-ray diffractometry and energy
dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. This discrepancy arises from the pinning of the
Fermi level at the sidewalls of the nanowires, which gives rise to strong
radial built-in electric fields. The combination of the built-in electric

a competition between spatially direct and indirect recombination channels. At
elevated temperatures, electrons at the core of the nanowire recombine with
holes close to the surface, and the emission from unintentionally doped

avant-garde studies to crucial tools for expanding our understanding of the
physics of strongly correlated materials. The possibility of obtaining
simultaneously spectroscopic and temporal information has led to insights that
are complementary to (and in several cases beyond) those attainable by studying
the matter at equilibrium. Multiple phase transitions and new orders arising
from competing interactions are benchmark examples where the interplay among
electrons, lattice, and spin dynamics can be disentangled because of the
different timescales that characterize the recovery of the initial ground
state. The nature of the broken-symmetry phases and of the bosonic excitations
that mediate the electronic interactions, eventually leading to
superconductivity or other exotic states, can be revealed by observing the
sub-picosecond dynamics of impulsively excited states. Recent experimental
developments have made possible to monitor the time-evolution of both the
single-particle and collective excitations under extreme conditions, such as
those arising from strong and selective photo-stimulation.
  Here, we review the most recent achievements in the experimental and
theoretical studies of the non-equilibrium electronic, optical, structural and
magnetic properties of correlated materials. The focus will be mainly on the
prototypical case of correlated oxides that exhibit unconventional
superconductivity or other exotic phases, even though the discussion will
extend also to other topical systems. The necessity of extending the actual
experimental capabilities and the numerical and analytic tools to
microscopically treat the non-equilibrium phenomena beyond the simple
phenomenological approaches represents one of the most challenging new frontier

propagation from chiral inputs to nuclear structure observables. The
uncertainty band spanned by the different chiral interactions is typically in
agreement with experimental excitation energies, but we also identify
observables with notable discrepancies beyond the theoretical uncertainty that

since time ago, in Mexico as well as in other regions worldwide the cases of
classic and hemorrhagic dengue continue to be reported presently. Since 2002
(and before), a worrying outbreak of dengue was observed in several states of
Mexico, notably the case of Colima for which a ""descacharrizacion"" campaign was
implemented in 2009 to encourage the population to get rid of old objects
accumulated in their backyards and outdoors so as to prevent proliferation of
mosquitoes Aedes Aegypti. To understand the effect of such campaign, we studied
the incidence of dengue in four municipalities of the mentioned state, namely
Manzanillo, Armeria, Tecoman and Ixtlahuacan. In particular, we observed that
the incidence of dengue in these four municipalities had a strong relationship
with climatological normals, specifically precipitation and minimum
temperature. Furthermore, the results showed that the mentioned campaign helped
prevent mosquito eggs incubation and their development, thus leading to
reduction of the incidence of dengue in the human population.

While period measurements have been obtained for hundreds of solar-mass members

M$_{\odot}$) members of this key laboratory for stellar evolution theory. To
fill this gap, we report rotation periods for 132 low-mass Pleiades members

photometric monitoring of the cluster conducted by the Palomar Transient

stellar rotation at 125 Myr to the lowest-mass stars and re-establish the
Pleiades as a key benchmark for models of the transport and evolution of
stellar angular momentum. Combining our new rotation periods with precise
BVIJHK photometry reported by Stauffer et al. and Kamai et al., we investigate
known anomalies in the photometric properties of K and M Pleiades members. We
confirm the correlation detected by Kamai et al. between a star's rotation
period and position relative to the main sequence in the cluster's

topics in GIS field. It aims at making GIS tools more sensitive for large
volumes of data stored inside GIS systems by integrating GIS with other
computer sciences such as Expert system (ES) Data Warehouse (DW), Decision
Support System (DSS), or Knowledge Discovery Database (KDD). One of the main
branches of IGIS is the Geographic Knowledge Discovery (GKD) which tries to
discover the implicit knowledge in the spatial databases. The main difference
between traditional KDD techniques and GKD techniques is hidden in the nature
of spatial data sets. In other words in the traditional data set the values of
each object are supposed to be independent from other objects in the same data
set, whereas the spatial dataset tends to be highly correlated according to the
first law of geography. The spatial outlier detection is one of the most
popular spatial data mining techniques which is used to detect spatial objects
whose non-spatial attributes values are extremely different from those of their
neighboring objects. Analyzing the behavior of these objects may produce an
interesting knowledge, which has an effective role in the decision-making
process. In this thesis, a new definition for the spatial neighborhood
relationship by is proposed considering the weights of the most effective
parameters of neighboring objects in a given spatial dataset. The spatial
parameters taken into our consideration are; distance, cost, and number of
direct connections between neighboring objects. A new model to detect spatial
outliers is also presented based on the new definition of the spatial
neighborhood relationship. This model is adapted to be applied to polygonal
objects. The proposed model is applied to an existing project for supporting

stored in an $n$ by $d$ data matrix. It is well-known that real data may
contain outliers. Depending on the situation, outliers may be (a) undesirable
errors which can adversely affect the data analysis, or (b) valuable nuggets of
unexpected information. In statistics and data analysis the word outlier
usually refers to a row of the data matrix, and the methods to detect such
outliers only work when at least half the rows are clean. But often many rows
have a few contaminated cell values, which may not be visible by looking at
each variable (column) separately. We propose the first method to detect
deviating data cells in a multivariate sample which takes the correlations
between the variables into account. It has no restriction on the number of
clean rows, and can deal with high dimensions. Other advantages are that it
provides estimates of the `expected' values of the outlying cells, while
imputing missing values at the same time. We illustrate the method on several
real data sets, where it uncovers more structure than found by purely
columnwise methods or purely rowwise methods. The proposed method can help to
diagnose why a certain row is outlying, e.g. in process control. It may also
serve as an initial step for estimating multivariate location and scatter
matrices.

exploit geometric differences between fonts at the word level, and combines
them into a bag-of-word representation for each page in a document. We evaluate
six sampling strategies based on uncertainty, dissimilarity and diversity
criteria, and test them on a database containing over 3,000 historical

combination of uncertainty and diversity achieves the highest predictive
accuracy (89% of test cases correctly classified) while requiring only a small

result for mass digitization projects of historical documents.

electron spins in a 250 nm thick nitroxide-doped polystyrene sample. Both
electron and proton spin resonance were observed as a change in the mechanical
resonance frequency of a nearby cantilever having a micron-scale nickel tip.
NMR signal, not observable from Curie-law magnetization at 0.6 tesla, became
observable when microwave irradiation was applied to saturate the electron
spins. The resulting NMR signal's size, buildup time, dependence on microwave
power, and dependence on irradiation frequency was consistent with a transfer
of magnetization from electron spins to nuclear spins. Due to the presence of
an inhomogenous magnetic field introduced by the cantilever's magnetic tip, the
electron spins in the sample were saturated in a microwave-resonant slice 10's
of nm thick. The spatial distribution of the nuclear polarization enhancement
factor $\epsilon$ was mapped by varying the frequency of the applied
radiowaves. The observed enhancement factor was zero for spins in the center of
the resonant slice, was $\epsilon = +10$ to $+20$ for spins proximal to the

field is a problem of interest in a broad range of applications. Often, the
target field admits structural properties that enable the design of lower
sample detection strategies with good performance. This paper designs a
sampling and localization strategy which exploits separability and unimodality
in target fields and theoretically analyzes the trade-off achieved between
sampling density, noise level and convergence rate of localization. In
particular, the strategy adopts an exploration-exploitation approach to target
detection and utilizes the theory of low-rank matrix completion, coupled with
unimodal regression, on decaying and approximately separable target fields. The
assumptions on the field are fairly generic and are applicable to many decay
profiles since no specific knowledge of the field is necessary, besides its
admittance of an approximately rank-one representation. Extensive numerical
experiments and comparisons are performed to test the efficacy and robustness
of the presented approach. Numerical results suggest that the proposed strategy
outperforms algorithms based on mean-shift clustering, surface interpolation
and naive low-rank matrix completion with peak detection, under low sampling
density.

distinguishing bipartite unitaries for a finite number of repetitions, contrast
to discrimination of a pair of bipartite states and also to asymptotic

to gain deeper understanding of the subject matter. Teachable agents are
commonly used in the areas of science and mathematics learning where learners
are able to learn complex concepts and deep reasoning by teaching the teachable
agent through graphic representation such as concept maps.
  Literature review on teachable agents as well as observations during field
studies conducted by the researcher, have shown that many current teachable
agents lack the interaction abilities required to keep learners engage in
learning tasks. The result of this is learners deviating from the teaching
process, and thus the learners are unable to benefit fully from learning with
the teachable agent. The applications of teachable agents are restricted to the
learning of academic subjects such as mathematics and science.
  In this book, we have proposed the Persuasive Teachable Agent (PTA), a
teachable agent based on the theoretical framework of persuasion, computational

capable of encouraging attitude and behavioural change can offer a more
meaningful and engaging learning experiences for learners from different age
groups. Based on the findings from our research we argue that persuasive
feedback actions generated by the PTA provide significant influence over
learner's decision to participate in intergenerational learning. The PTA plays
a crucial role in the development of future persuasive technologies in

  Model","13pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Content-based near-duplicate video detection (NDVD) is essential for
effective search and retrieval, and robust video fingerprinting is a good
solution for NDVD. Most existing video fingerprinting methods use a single
feature or concatenating different features to generate video fingerprints, and
show a good performance under single-mode modifications such as noise addition
and blurring. However, when they suffer combined modifications, the performance
is degraded to a certain extent because such features cannot characterize the
video content completely. By contrast, the assistance and consensus among
different features can improve the performance of video fingerprinting.
Therefore, in the present study, we mine the assistance and consensus among
different features based on tensor model, and present a new comprehensive
feature to fully use them in the proposed video fingerprinting framework. We
also analyze what the comprehensive feature really is for representing the
original video. In this framework, the video is initially set as a high-order
tensor that consists of different features, and the video tensor is decomposed
via the Tucker model with a solution that determines the number of components.
Subsequently, the comprehensive feature is generated by the low-order tensor
obtained from tensor decomposition. Finally, the video fingerprint is computed
using this feature. A matching strategy used for narrowing the search is also
proposed based on the core tensor. The robust video fingerprinting framework is
resistant not only to single-mode modifications, but also to the combination of
them.

nuclear structures of the exotic nuclei toward and beyond the nucleon drip

areas of extreme proton to neutron imbalance; whether the isospin symmetry
maintains in isobaric mirror nuclei at and beyond the drip lines, how
two-proton radioactivity affects abundances of the elements, what the role of
the continuum states including resonant states above the neutron- and

elastic restoring force that is much smaller than either term. We perform

often mathematically special. We consider a steady-state and spherically
symmetric accretion problem of ideal photon gas in general static spherically
symmetric spacetime neglecting back reaction. Our main result is that the EOS

historical growth of the world population in the past 12,000 years and with a
similar but limited study carried out over 50 years ago. This analysis is also
in harmony with the study of the historical economic growth. Within the range
of analysable data, there was no Malthusian stagnation. Takeoffs from
stagnation to growth, postulated by the Unified Growth Theory never happened.
There were no escapes from the Malthusian trap because there was no trap. This
analysis and the earlier studies of the Gross Domestic Product lead to the
conclusion that there were also no takeoffs in the income per capita
distributions, claimed by the Unified Growth Theory. Consequently, the claimed
in this theory differential timing in takeoffs never happened. Unified Growth
Theory is contradicted yet again by the mathematical analysis of the same data,
which were used, but never analysed, during the formulation of this theory.
However, this study, as well as the earlier publications on the related topics,
shows also that some fundamental postulates used in the economic and

accrete sufficient gas reservoirs to form new stars if the clusters orbited in

the restoration of previously accessed states during the exploration of a

previously performed operations using a trail, or top-down to redo them,
starting from a previously stored state and using suitable information stored
along the way. In this paper, we elucidate existing restoration techniques
using a pair of abstract methods and employ them to present a new technique
that we call recollection. The proposed technique stores the variables that
were affected by constraint propagation during fix points reasoning steps, and
it conducts neither operation roll-back nor recomputation, while consuming much
less memory than storing previous visited states. We implemented this idea as a
prototype within the Gecode solver. An empirical evaluation reveals that
constraint problems with expensive propagation and frequent failures can
benefit from recollection with respect to runtime at the expense of a marginal
increase in memory consumption, comparing with the most competitive variant of
recomputation.

that the introduction of quantum fluctuations stemming from coherent, rather

dissipative micro-stresses incorporates relaxation time parameters to account
for the time lags of the dissipative fluxes in attaining a steady state.
Augmentation of the micro-force balance with constitutive relations for the

micro-inertia on the evolution of the plastic strain. A thermodynamically
consistent derivation of temperature evolution is provided, thus replacing an
empirical route. Numerical implementation of the proposal does not demand a

the loop-top source to be clearly observed in UV, EUV and X-rays. EUV line
spectroscopy is performed in seven different regions. We study the line
profiles of isolated and unblended Fe XVI lines (262.976 A) formed at
temperatures of 2-4 MK. Fe XVI line profiles at one time close to the peak soft
X-ray emission and free of directed mass motions are examined using: 1. a
higher moments analysis, 2. Gaussian fitting, and 3. by fitting a kappa
distribution profile convolved with a Gaussian to account for the EIS
instrumental profile. Fe XVI line profiles in the loop-top, HXR footpoint and
ribbon regions can be confidently fitted with a kappa line profile, giving low,
non-thermal kappa values between 2-3.3. A higher moments analysis also finds
that many of the line kurtosis values are higher than the Gaussian value of 3,
even with the presence of a broad Gaussian instrumental profile. A
flare-accelerated non-thermal ion population could account for both the

a finite time in the photoemission process before being photoemitted as free
particles, in line with recent attosecondresolved photoemission experiments.
According to the Eisenbud-Wigner-Smith model, the time delay is due to a phase
shift of different transitions that occur in the process. Such a phase shift is
also at the origin of the angular dependent spin polarization of the
photoelectron beam, observable in spin degenerate systems without angular
momentum transfer by the incident photon. We propose a semi-quantitative model
which permits to relate spin and time scales in photoemission from condensed
matter targets and to better understand spin- and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (SARPES) experiments on spin degenerate systems. We also present
the first experimental determination by SARPES of this time delay in a
dispersive band, which is found to be greater than 26 as for electrons emitted
from the sp-bulk band of the model system Cu(111).

that it is possible to decrease the sparsity with the decrease in black hole
mass. Moreover, at some particular value of mass one has a continuous radiation
cascade. This result is completely new and quite different from the usual one.
An estimation of the mass for continuous one is also found. We see that the

are on a level of ~<=0.2mag per century (1889-1990) for the majority of

properties of a system are defined as those which are preserved under an
arbitrary change of reference frame. For a system of quantum spins, these are
all properties preserved by proper spatial rotations of the laboratory.
However, this approach does not account for the hypothetical possibility of the
laboratory becoming entangled to the system, as described by a second
laboratory (the `Wigner's friend' scenario), in which case the relationship
between the two laboratories is not a rotation, but is fundamentally quantum.
To overcome this limitation, we re-define the reference frame transformations
to be those that preserve the fidelities between subsystems. This enables us to
derive U(2) as the correct symmetry group for transformations of a system of N
spin-half particles. Next, we propose that systems having the same internal
properties should be regarded as physically equivalent in the absence of an
external frame. Remarkably, this implies that a single spin in a superposition
relative to a spin magnet is equivalent to a macroscopic superposition of the
magnet relative to the spin. We discuss the implications of this result for the
Wigner's friend paradox.

known probability distribution. The performance metric is the total hit
probability, which is the probability that a user at an arbitrary location in
the plane will find the content that it requires in one of the BSs that it is
covered by.
  We consider the problem of optimally placing content in all BSs jointly. As
this problem is not convex, we provide a heuristic scheme by finding the
optimal placement policy for one type of base station conditioned on the
placement in all other types. We demonstrate that these individual optimization
problems are convex and we provide an analytical solution. As an illustration,
we find the optimal placement policy of the small base stations (SBSs)
depending on the placement policy of the macro base stations (MBSs). We show
how the hit probability evolves as the deployment density of the SBSs varies.
We show that the heuristic of placing the most popular content in the MBSs is
almost optimal after deploying the SBSs with optimal placement policies. Also,
for the SBSs no such heuristic can be used; the optimal placement is
significantly better than storing the most popular content. Finally, we show
that solving the individual problems to find the optimal placement policies for
different types of BSs iteratively, namely repeatedly updating the placement
policies, does not improve the performance.

classification task for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices which is
very useful in computer vision. To address this problem, in this paper, a
neighborhood preserved kernel SRC method is proposed on SPD manifolds.
Specifically, by embedding the SPD matrices into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert

through an appropriate Log-Euclidean kernel. Through exploiting the geodesic
distance between SPD matrices, our method can effectively characterize the
intrinsic local Riemannian geometry within data so as to well unravel the

technology for 5G networks. In contrast to conventional
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, precoding in mmWave MIMO cannot
be performed entirely at baseband using digital precoders, as only a limited
number of signal mixers and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) can be
supported considering their cost and power consumption. As a cost-effective
alternative, a hybrid precoding transceiver architecture, combining a digital
precoder and an analog precoder, has recently received considerable attention.
However, the optimal design of such hybrid precoders has not been fully
understood. In this paper, treating the hybrid precoder design as a matrix
factorization problem, effective alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithms
will be proposed for two different hybrid precoding structures, i.e., the
fully-connected and partially-connected structures. In particular, for the
fully-connected structure, an AltMin algorithm based on manifold optimization
is proposed to approach the performance of the fully digital precoder, which,
however, has a high complexity. Thus, a low-complexity AltMin algorithm is then
proposed, by enforcing an orthogonal constraint on the digital precoder.
Furthermore, for the partially-connected structure, an AltMin algorithm is also
developed with the help of semidefinite relaxation. For practical
implementation, the proposed AltMin algorithms are further extended to the
broadband setting with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
modulation. Simulation results will demonstrate significant performance gains
of the proposed AltMin algorithms over existing hybrid precoding algorithms.
Moreover, based on the proposed algorithms, simulation comparisons between the
two hybrid precoding structures will provide valuable design insights.

highly beamed. Using two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we
investigate particle and radiation beaming, finding a very different picture.
Instead of having a relativistic average bulk motion with isotropic electron
velocity distribution in its rest frame, we find that the bulk motion of
particles in X-points is similar to their Lorentz factor gamma, and the
particles are beamed within about 5/gamma. On the way from the X-point to the
magnetic islands, particles turn in the magnetic field, forming a fan confined
to the current sheet. Once they reach the islands they isotropise after
completing a full Larmor gyration and their radiation is not strongly beamed
anymore. The radiation pattern at a given frequency depends on where the
corresponding emitting electrons radiate their energy. Lower energy particles
that cool slowly spend most of their time in the islands, and their radiation
is not highly beamed. Only particles that quickly cool at the edge of the
X-points generate a highly beamed fan-like radiation pattern. The radiation
emerging from these fast cooling particles is above the burn-off limit (about
100 MeV in the overall rest frame of the reconnecting plasma.) This has
significant implications for models of GRBs and AGNs that invoke beaming in
that frame at much lower energies.

exhibit long-range edge effects. We discuss that curvature effects govern the
electronic structure of short (5,0) FCNTs and enhance energy gap of these

compensation of curvature effects in two special small sizes, may give rise to
spontaneous magnetization. The obtained cohesive energies provide some insights
into the effects of environment on the growth of FCNTs. The second-order
difference of the total energies reveals an important magic size of about 15

invoked on an object of that type. In this paper we introduce a new property
for concurrent objects, we call coverability, that aims to provide precise
guarantees on the consistent evolution of an object. This new property is
suitable for a variety of distributed objects including concurrent file objects
that demand operations to manipulate the latest version of the object. We
propose two levels of coverability: (i) strong coverability and (ii) weak
coverability. Strong coverability requires that only a single operation can
modify the latest version of the object, i.e. ""covers"" the latest version with
a new version, imposing a total order on object modifications. Weak
coverability relaxes the strong requirements of strong coverability and allows
multiple operations to modify the same version of an object, where each
modification leads to a different version. Weak coverability preserves
consistent evolution of the object, by demanding any subsequent operation to
only modify one of the newly introduced versions. Coverability combined with
atomic guarantees yield to coverable atomic read/write registers. We also show
that strongly coverable atomic registers are equivalent in power to consensus.
Thus, we focus on weakly coverable registers, and we demonstrate their
importance by showing that they cannot be implemented using similar types of
registers, like ranked-registers. Furthermore we show that weakly coverable
registers may be used to implement basic (weak) read-modify-write and file
objects. Finally, we implement weakly coverable registers by modifying an
existing MWMR atomic register implementation.

of metrics on different layers including physical, virtual and application
layer. In turn, the EXCESS project introduces new energy-aware execution models
that improve energy-efficiency on a software level. Having in-depth knowledge
about the energy consumption and overall behavior of applications on a given
infrastructure, subsequent executions can be optimized to save energy. To
achieve this goal, the EXCESS monitoring framework provides APIs allowing
developers to collect application-specific data in addition to infrastructure
data at run-time. We perform a comparative analysis of both monitoring
approaches, and highlighting use cases including a hybrid approach which
benefits from both monitoring solutions.

progenitors with larger radii (~300 solar radii, typical of yellow supergiants)
and can thus be regarded as intermediate cases between normal SNe IIP and SN
1987A-like SNe. Some extended red supergiant (RSG) stars such as the progenitor

unstable step motion by employing two alternative sources of instability -
biased diffusion and infinite inverse Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier (iiSE). The
resulting step bunches consist of steps but also of macrosteps since there is
no step-step repulsion incorporated explicitly into the model. This complex
pattern formation is quantified by studying the time evolution of the bunch
size N and macrostep size Nm in order to find the proper parameter combinations
that rescale the time and thus to obtain the full time-scaling relations

neurons with time-series analysis techniques taken from research on complex
systems. Notably, we analyze time-series of neuron activations with Recurrence
Plots (RPs) and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA), which permit to
visualize and characterize high-dimensional dynamical systems. We show that
this approach is useful in a number of ways. First, the two-dimensional
representation offered by RPs provides a way for visualizing the
high-dimensional dynamics of a reservoir. Our results suggest that, if the
network is stable, reservoir and input denote similar line patterns in the
respective RPs. Conversely, the more unstable the ESN, the more the RP of the
reservoir presents instability patterns. As a second result, we show that the
$\mathrm{L_{max}}$ measure is highly correlated with the well-established
maximal local Lyapunov exponent. This suggests that complexity measures based
on RP diagonal lines distribution provide a valuable tool to quantify the
degree of network stability. Finally, our analysis shows that all RQA measures
fluctuate on the proximity of the so-called edge of stability, where an ESN
typically achieves maximum computational capability. We verify that the
determination of the edge of stability provided by such RQA measures is more
accurate than two well-known criteria based on the Jacobian matrix of the
reservoir. Therefore, we claim that RPs and RQA-based analyses can be used as
valuable tools to design an effective network given a specific problem.

the computation of multiple distinct solutions arising in the context of
modeling equilibrium configurations of nematic and cholesteric liquid crystals.
The deflation method is applied as part of an overall free-energy variational
approach and is modified to fit the framework of optimization of a functional
with pointwise constraints. It is shown that multigrid methods designed for the
undeflated systems may be applied to efficiently solve the linear systems
arising in the application of deflation. For the numerical algorithm, the
deflation approach is interwoven with nested iteration, creating a dynamic and
efficient method that further enables the discovery of distinct solutions.
Finally, four numerical experiments are performed demonstrating the efficacy
and accuracy of the algorithm in detecting important physical phenomena,
including bifurcation and disclination behaviors. The final numerical
experiment expands the algorithm to model cholesteric liquid crystals and
illustrates the full discovery power of the deflation process.

space-time DG method for the solution of the three-dimensional incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations on staggered unstructured curved tetrahedral meshes. As
typical for space-time DG schemes, the discrete solution is represented in
terms of space-time basis functions. This allows to achieve very high order of
accuracy also in time, which is not easy to obtain for the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations. Similar to staggered finite difference schemes, in our
approach the discrete pressure is defined on the primary tetrahedral grid,
while the discrete velocity is defined on a face-based staggered dual grid. A
very simple and efficient Picard iteration is used in order to derive a
space-time pressure correction algorithm that achieves also high order of
accuracy in time and that avoids the direct solution of global nonlinear
systems. Formal substitution of the discrete momentum equation on the dual grid
into the discrete continuity equation on the primary grid yields a very sparse
five-point block system for the scalar pressure, which is conveniently solved
with a matrix-free GMRES algorithm. From numerical experiments we find that the
linear system seems to be reasonably well conditioned, since all simulations
shown in this paper could be run without the use of any preconditioner. For a
piecewise constant polynomial approximation in time and proper boundary
conditions, the resulting system is symmetric and positive definite. This
allows us to use even faster iterative solvers, like the conjugate gradient
method. The proposed method is verified for approximation polynomials of degree
up to four in space and time by solving a series of typical 3D test problems
and by comparing the obtained numerical results with available exact analytical
solutions, or with other numerical or experimental reference data.

nuclear recoils trigger bubble nucleation. This process is described by the
classical heat spike model of F. Seitz [Phys. Fluids (1958-1988) 1, 2 (1958)],
which uses classical nucleation theory to estimate the amount and the
localization of the deposited energy required for bubble formation. Here we
report on direct molecular dynamics simulations of heat-spike-induced bubble
formation. They allow us to test the nanoscale process described in the
classical heat spike model. 40 simulations were performed, each containing
about 20 million atoms, which interact by a truncated force-shifted
Lennard-Jones potential. We find that the energy per length unit needed for
bubble nucleation agrees quite well with theoretical predictions, but the
allowed spike length and the required total energy are about twice as large as
predicted. This could be explained by the rapid energy diffusion measured in
the simulation: contrary to the assumption in the classical model, we observe
significantly faster heat diffusion than the bubble formation time scale.
Finally we examine {\alpha}-particle tracks, which are much longer than those
of neutrons and potential dark matter particles. Empirically, {\alpha} events
were recently found to result in louder acoustic signals than neutron events.
This distinction is crucial for the background rejection in dark matter
searches. We show that a large number of individual bubbles can form along an
{\alpha} track, which explains the observed larger acoustic amplitudes.

in the diphoton channels. This might be the evidence which reveals new physics
beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we consider models with a $750$ GeV
scalar and vector-like particles, which couple each other through Yukawa
couplings. The diphoton decay of the scalar is enhanced by the loop diagrams
involving the extra colored particles. We investigate not only the setup
required by the excesses, but also the LHC constraints, especially concerned
with the vector-like particles. We consider the scenario that the extra colored
particles decay to quarks and a dark matter (DM) via Yukawa couplings. Then,
the signals from the vector-like particles are dijet, $b\overline{b}$ and/or
$t\overline{t}$ with large missing energy. We discuss two possibilities for the
setups: One is a model with vector-like fermions and a scalar DM, and the other
is a model with vector-like scalars and a fermionic DM. We suggest the
parameter region favored by the excess in the each case, and study the
constraints based on the latest LHC results at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV and $13$ TeV.
We conclude that the favored region is almost excluded by the LHC bounds,
especially when the $750$ GeV scalar dominantly decays to DMs. The mass
differences between the vector-like particles and the DM should be less than
${\cal O}(100)$ GeV (${\cal O}(10)$ GeV) to realize the large diphoton signal
and the large decay width, if the extra colored particle only decays to a top
(bottom) quark and a DM. Otherwise, these scenarios are already excluded by the
latest LHC results.

conclude that emission of the neutral molecules (Ar2)* comes from within the
whole volume of the cluster, while the charged complexes (Ar4+)* radiate from
its near-surface layers. We find the cluster size range in which the jet is
dominated by quasicrystalline clusters with an icosahedral structure and
demonstrate that the transition from icosahedral to fcc clusters occurs when
the average cluster size is N = 1400+-400 atoms per cluster.

a way of representing the complex structure of contacts capable of spreading
infections through the modern human population. The configuration model is a
popular choice in theoretical studies since it combines the ability to specify
the distribution of the number of contacts (degree) with analytical
tractability. Here we consider the early real-time behaviour of the Markovian
SIR epidemic model on a configuration model network using a multi-type
branching process. We find closed-form analytic expressions for the mean and
variance of the number of infectious individuals as a function of time and the
degree of the initially infected individual(s), and write down a system of
differential equations for the probability of extinction that are numerically
fast compared to Monte Carlo simulation. We show that these quantities are all
sensitive to the degree distribution - in particular we confirm that the mean
prevalence of infection depends on the first two moments of the degree
distribution and the variance in prevalence depends on the first three moments
of the degree distribution. In contrast to most existing analytic approaches,
the accuracy of these results does not depend on having a large number of
infectious individuals, meaning that in the large population limit they would
be asymptotically exact even for one initial infectious individual.

non-differentiability in mechanics and its relation to quantum mechanics. It
stems from the scale relativity proposal to extend the principle of relativity
to resolution-scale transformations, which leads to considering
non-differentiable dynamical paths. We first define a complex scale-covariant
time-differential operator and show that mechanics of non-differentiable paths
is implemented in the same way as classical mechanics but with the replacement
of the time derivative and velocity with the time-differential operator and
associated complex velocity. With this, the generalized form of Newton's
fundamental relation of dynamics is shown to take the form of a Langevin
equation in the case of stationary motion characterized by a null average
classical velocity. The numerical integration of the Langevin equation in the
case of a harmonic oscillator taken as an example reveals the same statistics
as the stationary solutions of the Schrodinger equation for the same problem.
This motivates the rest of the paper, which shows Schrodinger's equation to be
a reformulation of Newton's fundamental relation of dynamics as generalized to
non-differentiable geometries and leads to an alternative interpretation of the
other axioms of standard quantum mechanics in a coherent picture. This exercise
validates the scale relativistic approach and, at the same time, it allows to
envision macroscopic chaotic systems observed at resolution time-scales
exceeding their horizon of predictability as candidates in which to search for
quantum-like dynamics and structures.

to the case, where big bang singularity is equivalent to the continuity of the

operators. Estimation of moments and establishing few basic approximation
results which comprise weighted approximation and direct estimates in view of
modulus of continuity is the aim of this paper. Steklov mean method has been
used for linear approximation. For the particular case {\alpha} = 0, \b{eta} =
0, we get (p, q) -Sz\'asz-Mirakyan-Baskakov operators.

  method","25 pages",,,,"math.RA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $\mathfrak{a},\mathfrak{b},\mathfrak{e}$ be algebras over a field $k$.
Then $\mathfrak{e}$ is an extension of $\mathfrak{a}$ by $\mathfrak{b}$ if
$\mathfrak{a}$ is an ideal of $\mathfrak{e}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$ is isomorphic
to the quotient algebra $\mathfrak{e}/\mathfrak{a}$. In this paper, by using
Gr\""obner-Shirshov bases theory for associative (resp. Lie) algebras, we give
complete characterizations of associative (resp. Lie) algebra extensions of
$\mathfrak{a}$ by $\mathfrak{b}$, where $\mathfrak{b}$ is presented by
generators and relations.
