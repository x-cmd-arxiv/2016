To investigate the dynamical properties of protostellar jets. Aims.
Determine the proper motion of protostellar jets around Class 0 and Class I
sources in an active star forming region in Serpens. Methods. Multi-epoch deep
images in the 2.122 $\mu$m line of molecular hydrogen, v=1-0 S(1), obtained
with the near-infrared instrument NOTCam over a time-scale of 10 years, are
used to determine proper motion of knots and jets. K-band spectroscopy of the
brighter knots is used to supply radial velocities, estimate extinction,
excitation temperature, and H$_2$ column densities towards these knots.
Results. We measure the proper motion of 31 knots over different time scales
(2, 4, 6, and 10 years). The typical tangential velocity is around 50 km/s for
the 10 year base-line, but for shorter time-scales a maximum tangential
velocity up to 300 km/s is found for a few knots. Based on morphology, velocity
information and the locations of known protostars, we argue for the existence
of at least three partly overlapping and deeply embedded flows, one Class 0
flow and two Class I flows. The multi-epoch proper motion results indicate
time-variable velocities of the knots, for the first time directly measured for
a Class 0 jet. We find in general higher velocities for the Class 0 jet than
for the two Class I jets. While the bolometric luminosites of the three driving
sources are about equal, the derived mass flow rate (dM/dt)$_{\rm out}$ is two
orders of magnitude higher in the Class 0 flow than in the two Class I flows.

Nicaragua are revisited. This new analysis of data indicates that the episodes
occurred in Brazil and Nicaragua can be understood within the frame of the
model available in the literature, which is based on a nonlinear feedback (NLF)
characterized by an exponent $\beta>0$. In the NLF model the accumulated
consumer price index carries a finite time singularity of the type
$1/(t_c-t)^{(1- \beta)/\beta}$ determining a critical time $t_c$ at which the
economy would crash. It is shown that in the case of Brazil the entire episode
cannot be described with a unique set of parameters because the time series was
strongly affected by a change of policy. This fact gives support to the ""so
called"" Lucas critique, who stated that model's parameters usually change once
policy changes. On the other hand, such a model is not able to provide any
$t_c$ in the case of the weaker hyperinflation occurred in Israel. It is shown
that in this case the fit of data yields $\beta \to 0$. This limit leads to the
linear feedback formulation which does not predict any $t_c$. An extension for
the NLF model is suggested.

inference of initial conditions, we present a cosmographic analysis of the dark
matter distribution and its evolution, referred to as the dark matter
phase-space sheet, in the nearby universe as probed by the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey main galaxy sample. We consider its stretchings and foldings using a
tetrahedral tessellation of the Lagrangian lattice. The method provides
extremely accurate estimates of nearby density and velocity fields, even in
regions of low galaxy density. It also measures the number of matter streams,
and the deformation and parity reversals of fluid elements, which were
previously thought inaccessible using observations. We illustrate the approach
by showing the phase-space structure of known objects of the nearby Universe
such as the Sloan Great Wall, the Coma cluster and the Bo\""otes void. We
dissect cosmic structures into four distinct components (voids, sheets,
filaments, and clusters), using the Lagrangian classifiers DIVA, ORIGAMI, and a
new scheme which we introduce and call LICH. Because these classifiers use
information other than the sheer local density, identified structures
explicitly carry physical information about their formation history. Accessing
the phase-space structure of dark matter in galaxy surveys opens the way for
new confrontations of observational data and theoretical models. We have made

gravitational model, where diffeomorphism invariance is broken dynamically via
a non-standard coupling to a perfect fluid. The theory allows to address some
of the potential instability problems present in Horava-Lifshitz gravity due to
explicit diffeomorphism invariance breaking. The fluid is instead constructed
from a scalar field constrained by a Lagrange multiplier. In fact, the Lagrange
multiplier construction allows for an extension of the Horava-like model to
include the scalar field of mimetic gravity, an extension which we thoroughly
explore. By adding a potential for the scalar field, we show how one can
reproduce a number of interesting cosmological scenarios. We then turn to the
study of perturbations around a flat FLRW background, showing that the fluid in
question behaves as an irrotational fluid, with zero sound speed. To address
this problem, we consider a modified version of the theory, adding higher
derivative terms in a way which brings us beyond the Horndeski framework. We
compute the sound speed in this modified higher order mimetic Horava-like model
and show that it is non-zero, which means that perturbations therein can be
sensibly defined. Caveats to our analysis, as well as comparisons to
projectable Horava-Lifshitz gravity, are also discussed. In conclusion, we
present a theory of gravity which preserves diffeomorphism invariance at the
level of the action but breaks it dynamically in the UV, reduces to General
Relativity in the IR, allows the realization of a number of interesting
cosmological scenarios, is well defined when considering perturbations around a
flat FLRW background, and features cosmological dark matter emerging as an
integration constant.

disordered Ising spin systems evolving at zero temperature from a random
initial state: how much does the final state depend on the information
contained in the initial state, and how much depends on the detailed history of
the system? Our numerical studies of the ""dynamical order parameter"" in
Edwards-Anderson Ising spin glasses and random ferromagnets indicate that the
influence of the initial state decays as dimension increases. Similarly, this
same order parameter for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick infinite-range spin glass
indicates that this information decays as the number of spins increases. Based
on these results, we conjecture that the influence of the initial state on the
final state decays to zero in finite-dimensional random-bond spin systems as
dimension goes to infinity, regardless of the presence of frustration. We also
study the rate at which spins ""freeze out"" to a final state as a function of
dimensionality and number of spins; here the results indicate that the number
of ""active"" spins at long times increases with dimension (for short-range
systems) or number of spins (for infinite-range systems). We provide
theoretical arguments to support these conjectures, and also study analytically
several mean-field models: the random energy model, the uniform Curie-Weiss
ferromagnet, and the disordered Curie-Weiss ferromagnet. We find that for these
models, the information contained in the initial state does not decay in the
thermodynamic limit-- in fact, it fully determines the final state. Unlike in
short-range models, the presence of frustration in mean-field models
dramatically alters the dynamical behavior with respect to the issue of
predictability.

earlier results by Fabes, Kenig, and Serapioni for a single degenerate equation
governed by a scalar A${}_p$ weight. In addition, we prove Cacciopoli and
reverse H\""older inequalities for weak solutions of the degenerate systems. As
a means to prove the Poincar\'e inequalities we prove that the Riesz potential
and fractional maximal function operators are bounded on matrix weighted $L^p$
spaces and go on to develop an entire matrix A${}_{p, q}$ theory.

discussed. An iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm is used to solve
the problem. At each iteration the solution of a linear system of equations and
the determination of a suitable regularization parameter are considered. The
LSQR iteration is used to project the system of equations onto a smaller
subspace that inherits the ill-conditioning of the full space problem. We show
that the gravity kernel is only mildly to moderately ill-conditioned. Thus,
while the dominant spectrum of the projected problem accurately approximates
the dominant spectrum of the full space problem, the entire spectrum of the
projected problem inherits the ill-conditioning of the full problem.
Consequently, determining the regularization parameter based on the entire
spectrum of the projected problem necessarily over compensates for the
non-dominant portion of the spectrum and leads to inaccurate approximations for
the full-space solution. In contrast, finding the regularization parameter
using a truncated singular space of the projected operator is efficient and
effective. Simulations for synthetic examples with noise demonstrate the
approach using the method of unbiased predictive risk estimation for the
truncated projected spectrum. The method is used on gravity data from the

large-area sky surveys requires that the calibrated broadband photometry is
stable in time and uniform over the sky to 1% precision or better. Past surveys
have achieved photometric precision of 1-2% by calibrating the survey's stellar
photometry with repeated measurements of a large number of stars observed in
multiple epochs. The calibration techniques employed by these surveys only
consider the relative frame-by-frame photometric zeropoint offset and the focal
plane position-dependent illumination corrections, which are independent of the
source color. However, variations in the wavelength dependence of the
atmospheric transmission and the instrumental throughput induce source
color-dependent systematic errors. These systematic errors must also be
considered to achieve the most precise photometric measurements. In this paper,
we examine such systematic chromatic errors using photometry from the Dark
Energy Survey (DES) as an example. We define a natural magnitude system for DES
and calculate the systematic errors on stellar magnitudes, when the atmospheric
transmission and instrumental throughput deviate from the natural system. We
conclude that the systematic chromatic errors caused by the change of airmass
in each exposure, the change of the precipitable water vapor and aerosol in the
atmosphere over time, and the non-uniformity of instrumental throughput over
the focal plane, can be up to 2% in some bandpasses. We compare the calculated
systematic chromatic errors with the observed DES data. For the test sample
data, we correct these errors using measurements of the atmospheric
transmission and instrumental throughput. The residual after correction is less
than 0.3%. We also find that the errors for non-stellar objects are
redshift-dependent and can be larger than those for stars at certain redshifts.

walk (ISAW) model, placed on a Husimi lattice built with squares, is presented.
In this model, beyond the traditional interaction $\omega_1=e^{\epsilon_1/k_B
T}$ between (nonconsecutive) monomers on nearest-neighbor (NN) sites, an
additional energy $\epsilon_2$ is associated to next-NN (NNN) monomers. Three
definitions of NNN sites/interactions are considered, where each monomer can
have, effectively, at most 2, 4 or 6 NNN monomers on the Husimi lattice. The
phase diagrams found in all cases have (qualitatively) the same thermodynamic
properties: a non-polymerized (NP) and a polymerized (P) phase separated by a
critical and a coexistence surface that meet at a tricritical ($\theta$-) line.
This $\theta$-line is found even when one of the interactions is repulsive,
existing for $\omega_1$ in the range $[0,\infty)$, i. e., for $\epsilon_1/k_B
T$ in the range $[-\infty,\infty)$. Counterintuitively, a $\theta$-point exists
even for an infinite repulsion between NN monomers ($\omega_1=0$), being
associated to a coil-""soft globule"" transition. In the limit of an infinite
repulsive force between NNN monomers, however, the coil-globule transition
disappears and only a NP-P continuous transition is observed. This particular
case, with $\omega_2=0$, is also solved exactly on the square lattice, using a
transfer matrix calculation, where a discontinuous NP-P transition is found.
For attractive and repulsive forces between NN and NNN monomers, respectively,
the model becomes quite similar to the semiflexible-ISAW one, whose crystalline
phase is not observed here, as a consequence of the frustration due to
competing NN and NNN forces. The mapping of the phase diagrams in canonical
ones is discussed and compared with recent results from Monte Carlo
simulations.

despite these advances, practical implementations of quantum photonic circuits
remain limited because they consist of large networks of waveguide
interferometers that path encode information which do not easily scale.
Increasing the dimensionality of current quantum systems using higher degrees
of freedom such as transverse spatial field distribution, polarization, time,
and frequency to encode more information per carrier will enable scalability by
simplifying quantum computational architectures, increasing security and noise
tolerance in quantum communication channels, and simulating richer quantum
phenomena. Here we demonstrate a scalable platform for photonic quantum
information processing using waveguide quantum circuit building blocks based on
the transverse spatial mode degree of freedom: mode multiplexers and mode
beamsplitters. A multimode waveguide is inherently a densely packed system of
spatial and polarization modes that can be coupled by perturbations to the
waveguide. We design a multimode waveguide consisting of three spatial modes
(per polarization) and a nanoscale grating beamsplitter to show tunable quantum
interference between pairs of photons in different transverse spatial modes. We
also cascade these structures and demonstrate NOON state interferometry within
a multimode waveguide. These devices have potential to perform transformations
on more modes and be integrated with existing architectures, providing a
scalable path to higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces and entanglement.

geometric group theory. Specifically, we ask whether it is possible to bound
the sequence of codimensions for an associative PI-algebra using techniques
from geometric group theory. The classic and best known bound on codimension
growth was derived by finding a particularly nice spanning set for the
multilinear polynomials of degree n inside the free algebra. This spanning set
corresponds to permutations in the symmetric group which are so-called d-good,
where d is the degree of an identity satisfied by the algebra. The motivation
for our question comes from the fact that there is an obvious relationship
between the word metric on the symmetric group and the property of being
d-good. We answer in the affirmative, by finding a spanning set that
corresponds to permutations which are large with respect to the word metric. We
provide an explicit algorithm and formula for calculating the size of the
resulting bound, and demonstrate that it is asymptotically worse than the
classic one.

transient gravitational-wave events in a ground-based interferometer network.
Given the presence of non-Gaussian noise artefacts in real data, the noise
background must be estimated empirically from the data itself. However, the
data also potentially contains signals, thus the background estimate may be
overstated due to contributions from signals. It has been proposed to mitigate
possible bias by removing single-detector data samples that pass a
multi-detector consistency test from the background estimates. We conduct a
high-statistics Mock Data Challenge to evaluate the effects of removing such
samples, modelling a range of scenarios with plausible detector noise
distributions and with a range of plausible foreground astrophysical signal
rates. We consider the two different modes: one in which coincident samples are
removed, and one in which all samples are retained and used. Three algorithms
were operated in both modes, show good consistency with each other; however,
discrepancies arise between the results obtained under the ""coincidence
removal"" and ""all samples"" modes, for false alarm probabilities below a certain
value. In most scenarios the median of the false alarm probability (FAP)
estimator under the ""all samples"" mode is consistent with the exact FAP. On the
other hand the ""coincidence removal"" mode is found to be unbiased for the mean
of the estimated FAP. While the numerical values at which discrepancies become
apparent are specific to the details of our experiment, we believe that the
qualitative differences in the behaviour of the median and mean of the FAP
estimator have more general validity. On the basis of our study we suggest that
the FAP of candidates for the first detection of gravitational waves should be
estimated without removing single-detector samples that form coincidences.

system comprising an M-type red giant that undergoes a ~3.45 year long,
near-total eclipse (depth of ~4.5 mag) with a very long period of ~69.1 yr. TYC
2505-672-1 is now the longest-period eclipsing binary system yet discovered,
more than twice as long as that of the currently longest-period system,
$\epsilon$ Aurigae. We show from analysis of the light curve including both our
own data and historical data spanning more than 120 yr and from modeling of the
spectral energy distribution, both before and during eclipse, that the red
giant primary is orbited by a moderately hot source (T$_{eff}$~8000 K) that is
itself surrounded by an extended, opaque circumstellar disk. From the measured
ratio of luminosities, the radius of the hot companion must be in the range
0.1-0.5 Rsun (depending on the assumed radius of the red giant primary), which
is an order of magnitude smaller than that for a main sequence A star and 1-2
orders of magnitude larger than that for a white dwarf. The companion is
therefore most likely a ""stripped red giant"" subdwarf-B type star destined to
become a He white dwarf. It is however somewhat cooler than most sdB stars,
implying a very low mass for this ""pre-He-WD"" star. The opaque disk surrounding
this hot source may be a remnant of the stripping of its former hydrogen
envelope. However, it is puzzling how this object became stripped, given that
it is at present so distant (orbital semi-major axis of ~24 AU) from the
current red giant primary star. Extrapolating from our calculated ephemeris,
the next eclipse should begin in early UT 2080 April and end in mid UT 2083
September (eclipse center UT 2081 December 24). This system is poised to become
an exemplar of a very rare class of systems, even more extreme in several
respects than the well studied archetype $\epsilon$ Aurigae.

that during the pre local stages of the thermal equilibrium the entanglement
entropy has a faster growth in time compared to its relativistic cousin.
However, it shows a linear growth during the post local stages of thermal
equilibrium where the so called tsunami velocity associated with the linear
growth of the entanglement entropy saturates to that of its value corresponding
to the relativistic scenario. Finally, we explore the saturation region and it
turns out that one must constraint certain parameters of the theory in a
specific way in order to have a discontinuous transitions at the point of
saturation.

disjointly distributed among multiple threads for processing to avoid the use

This method is based on Amara et al. (2012), where they use the galaxy density
field to construct a bias-weighted convergence field kg. The main difference
between Amara et al. (2012) and our new implementation is that here we present
another way to measure galaxy bias using tomography instead of bias
parameterizations. The correlation between kg and the true lensing field k
allows us to measure galaxy bias using different zero-lag correlations, such as
<kgk>/<kk> or <kgkg>/<kgk>. Our method measures the linear bias factor on
linear scales under the assumption of no stochasticity between galaxies and
matter. We use the MICE simulation to measure the linear galaxy bias for a
flux-limited sample (i < 22.5) in tomographic redshift bins using this method.
This paper is the first that studies the accuracy and systematic uncertainties
associated with the implementation of the method, and the regime where it is
consistent with the linear galaxy bias defined by projected 2-point correlation
functions (2PCF). We find that our method is consistent with linear bias at the
percent level for scales larger than 30 arcmin, while nonlinearities appear at
smaller scales. This measurement is a good complement to other measurements of
bias, since it does not depend strongly on sigma8 as the 2PCF measurements. We
apply this method to the Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data in a
follow-up paper.

the deuterium fractionation in the interstellar medium. In cold regions, the
hyperfine structure due to the nitrogen ($^{14}$N) nucleus is resolved. To
date, this splitting is the only one which is taken into account in the NH$_2$D
column density estimates. We investigate how the inclusion of the hyperfine
splitting caused by the deuterium (D) nucleus affects the analysis of the
rotational lines of NH$_2$D. We present 30m IRAM observations of the above
mentioned lines, as well as APEX o/p-NH$_2$D observations of the
1$_{01}$-0$_{00}$ lines at 333 GHz. The hyperfine spectra are first analyzed
with a line list that only includes the hyperfine splitting due to the $^{14}$N
nucleus. We find inconsistencies between the line widths of the
1$_{01}$-0$_{00}$ and 1$_{11}$-1$_{01}$ lines, the latter being larger by a
factor of $\sim$1.6$\pm0.3$. Such a large difference is unexpected given the
two sets of lines are likely to originate from the same region. We next employ
a newly computed line list for the o/p-NH$_2$D transitions, where the hyperfine
structure induced by both nitrogen and deuterium nuclei is included. With this
new line list, the analysis of the previous spectra leads to linewidths which
are compatible. Neglecting the hyperfine structure owing to D leads to
overestimate the linewidths of the o/p-NH$_2$D lines at 3 mm. The error for a
cold molecular core is about 50\%. This error propagates directly to the column
density estimate. It is therefore recommended to take into account the
hyperfine splittings caused by both the $^{14}$N and D nuclei in any analysis
relying on these lines.

the exponential stability of the system. However, in the natural physical case
when the speeds of propagation are different, using a spectrum method, we show
that the Bresse system is not uniformly stable. In this case, we establish a
polynomial energy decay rate. Our study is valid for all other mixed boundary
conditions and generalizes that of [6], [10], and [22].

their disposal. Each of these might impose some privacy threats on users'
""Personally Identifiable Information"" (PII). Location privacy is a crucial part
of PII, and as such, privacy-aware users wish to maximize it. This privacy can
be, for instance, threatened by a company, which collects users' traces and
shares them with third parties. To maximize their location privacy, users can
decide to get offline so that the company cannot localize their devices. The
longer a user stays connected to a network, the more services he might receive,
but his location privacy decreases. In this paper, we analyze the trade-off
between location privacy, the level of services that a user experiences, and
the profit of the company. To this end, we formulate a Stackelberg Bayesian
game between the User (follower) and the Company (leader). We present
theoretical results characterizing the equilibria of the game. To the best of
our knowledge, our work is the first to model the economically rational
decision-making of the service provider (i.e., the Company) in conjunction with
the rational decision-making of users who wish to protect their location
privacy. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we have used real-data
from a testbed, and we have also shown that the game-theoretic strategy of the
Company outperforms non-strategic methods. Finally, we have considered
different User privacy types, and have determined the service level that
incentivizes the User to stay connected as long as possible.

bounds, Higgs mass bounds, B-physics bounds, the muon magnetic moment
constraint, and the Higgs coupling constraint from measurements at HL-LHC, ILC,

sparticle masses. Our study indicates that the Higgs coupling and muon
anomalous magnetic moment measurements can constrain the parameter space
effectively. It is shown that $\Delta_{\rm EW}\sim$ 30, consistence with all
constraints, and having supersymmetric contributions to the muon anomalous
magnetic moment within 1$\sigma$ can be achieved. The precision of $k_b$ and
$k_{\tau}$ measurements at CEPC can bound $m_A$ to be above 1.2 TeV and 1.1 TeV
respectively. The combination of the Higgs coupling measurement and muon
anomalous magnetic moment measurement constrain $\tilde{e}_R$ mass to be in the
range from 0.6 TeV to 2 TeV. The range of both $\tilde{e}_L$ and
$\tilde{\nu}_e$ masses is 0.4 TeV $\sim$ 1.2 TeV. In all cases, the
$\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ mass needs to be small (mostly $\leq$ 400 GeV). The
comparison of bounds in the $\tan\beta - m_A$ plane shows that the Higgs
coupling measurement is complementary to the direct collider searches for heavy
Higgs when constraining the natural SUSY. A few mass spectra in the typical
region of parameter space after applying all constraints are shown as well.

two-particle systems composed of a baryon (nucleon) and a meson.We used a
baryon - meson picture to reduce a complicated five-body problem to a simple
two-body problems. The homogeneous Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation is
solved in configuration space by using one pion exchange potential. We
calculate the masses of pentaquarks $\theta_{c}(uudd\bar{c})$,
$\theta_{b}(uudd\bar{b})$.

dimensional, gauge invariant and parity preserving model which was discussed in
several contexts. In this paper we have discussed its quantum aspects through
the introduction of Planck scale objects, i.e., via noncommutativity and the
well known BV quantization. Namely, we have constructed the JP noncommutative
spacetime version and we have provided the BV quantization of the commutative
JP model and we have discussed its features. The noncommutativity has
introduced interesting new objects in JP's Planck scale framework.

experiment. It provides an excellent opportunity to study heavy quarkonium
physics using the dimuon channel in heavy ion collisions. In this paper, we
report the muon identification performance for the MTD using proton-proton
collision at $\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV with various methods. The result using the
Likelihood Ratio method shows that the muon identification efficiency can reach
to $\sim$90% for muons with transverse momentum greater than 3 GeV/c and the
significance of J/$\psi$ signal is improved by $\sim$40% compared to using the
basic selection.

  of working memory","21 pages, 5 figures, 1 table",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The time-based resource sharing (TBRS) model is a prominent model of working
memory that is both predictive and simple. The TBRS is the mainstream
decay-based model and the most susceptible to competition with
interference-based models. A connectionist implementation of the TBRS, the
TBRS*, has recently been developed. However, the TBRS* is an enriched version
of the TBRS, making it difficult to test the general characteristics resulting
from the TBRS assumptions. Here, we describe a novel model, the TBRS2, built to
be more transparent and simple than the TBRS*. The TBRS2 is minimalist and
allows only a few parameters. It is a straightforward mathematical
transcription of the TBRS that focuses exclusively on the activation level of
memory items as a function of time. Its simplicity makes it possible to derive
several theorems from the original TBRS and allows several variants of the
refreshing process to be tested without relying on particular architectures.
