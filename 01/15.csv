high-$p_T$ photon at the LHC, detailing the leading-order features of the main
processes contributing to the $H\gamma$ final state. Requiring an extra hard
photon in Higgs production upsets the cross-section hierarchy for the dominant
channels. The $H\gamma$ inclusive production comes mainly from photons radiated
in vector-boson fusion (VBF), which accounts for about 2/3 of the total rate,
for $p_T^{\gamma,j} >30$ GeV, at leading order. On the other hand, radiating a
high-$p_T$ photon in the main top-loop Higgs channel implies an extra parton in
the final state, which suppresses the production rate by a further $\alpha_S$
power. As a result, the $H\gamma$ production via top loops at the LHC has rates
comparable with the ones arising from either the $H t\bar t$ production or the
$HW(Z)\gamma$ associated production. Then, in order of decreasing cross
section, comes the single-top-plus-Higgs channel, followed in turn by the
heavy-flavor fusion processes $b\bar b \to H\gamma$ and $c\bar c \to H\gamma$.
The $H\gamma$ production via electroweak loops has just a minor role. At larger
c.m. energies, the $H t\bar t\gamma$ channel surpasses the total contribution
of top-loop processes. In particular, requiring $p_T^{\gamma,j} >30$ GeV at
$\sqrt S \simeq 100$ TeV, $H t\bar t\gamma$ accounts for about $1/4$ of the
inclusive $H\gamma$ production at leading order, about half of the total being
due to VBF production.

to non-equilibrium states (""quasi-stationary states"" or QSS) which are
stationary in the thermodynamic limit. A fundamental open question concerns the
""robustness"" of these states when the system is not isolated. In this paper we
explore, using both analytical and numerical approaches to a paradigmatic one
dimensional model, the effect of a simple class of perturbations. We call them
""internal local perturbations"" in that the particle energies are perturbed at
collisions in a way which depends only on the local properties. Our central
finding is that the effect of the perturbations is to drive all the very
different QSS we consider towards a unique QSS. The latter is thus independent
of the initial conditions of the system, but determined instead by both the
long-range forces and the details of the perturbations applied. Thus in the
presence of such a perturbation the long-range system evolves to a unique
non-equilibrium stationary state, completely different to its state in absence
of the perturbation, and it remains in this state when the perturbation is
removed. We argue that this result may be generic for long-range interacting
systems subject to perturbations which are dependent on the local properties
(e.g. spatial density or velocity distribution) of the system itself.

Aggregate contact durations were highly heterogeneous and the resulting contact

were used to construct histories and statistics of contacts informed by the use

for robot motion planning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs).
Functional gradient algorithms are a popular choice for motion planning in
complex many-degree-of-freedom robots, since they (in theory) work by directly
optimizing within a space of continuous trajectories to avoid obstacles while
maintaining geometric properties such as smoothness. However, in practice,
functional gradient algorithms typically commit to a fixed, finite
parameterization of trajectories, often as a list of waypoints. Such a
parameterization can lose much of the benefit of reasoning in a continuous
trajectory space: e.g., it can require taking an inconveniently small step size
and large number of iterations to maintain smoothness. Our work generalizes
functional gradient trajectory optimization by formulating it as minimization
of a cost functional in an RKHS. This generalization lets us represent
trajectories as linear combinations of kernel functions, without any need for
waypoints. As a result, we are able to take larger steps and achieve a locally
optimal trajectory in just a few iterations. Depending on the selection of
kernel, we can directly optimize in spaces of trajectories that are inherently
smooth in velocity, jerk, curvature, etc., and that have a low-dimensional,
adaptively chosen parameterization. Our experiments illustrate the
effectiveness of the planner for different kernels, including Gaussian RBFs,
Laplacian RBFs, and B-splines, as compared to the standard discretized waypoint
representation.

biologically supported, and is advantageous over frequency-based codes by
processing input features on a much shorter time-scale. For these reasons, much
recent attention has been focused on the development of supervised learning
rules for spiking neural networks that utilise a temporal coding scheme.
However, despite significant progress in this area, there still lack rules that
have a theoretical basis, and yet can be considered biologically relevant. Here
we examine the general conditions under which synaptic plasticity most
effectively takes place to support the supervised learning of a precise
temporal code. As part of our analysis we examine two spike-based learning
methods: one of which relies on an instantaneous error signal to modify
synaptic weights in a network (INST rule), and the other one on a filtered
error signal for smoother synaptic weight modifications (FILT rule). We test
the accuracy of the solutions provided by each rule with respect to their
temporal encoding precision, and then measure the maximum number of input
patterns they can learn to memorise using the precise timings of individual
spikes as an indication of their storage capacity. Our results demonstrate the
high performance of FILT in most cases, underpinned by the rule's
error-filtering mechanism, which is predicted to provide smooth convergence
towards a desired solution during learning. We also find FILT to be most
efficient at performing input pattern memorisations, and most noticeably when
patterns are identified using spikes with sub-millisecond temporal precision.
In comparison with existing work, we determine the performance of FILT to be
consistent with that of the highly efficient E-learning Chronotron, but with
the distinct advantage that FILT is also implementable as an online method for
increased biological realism.

without the need to invoke clouds. We show that, due to the slowness of the
CO/CH4 and N2/NH3 chemical reactions, brown dwarf (L and T, respectively) and
EGP atmospheres are subject to a thermo-chemical instability similar in nature
to the fingering or chemical convective instability present in Earth oceans and
at the Earth core/mantle boundary. The induced small-scale turbulent energy
transport reduces the temperature gradient in the atmosphere, explaining the
observed increase in near infrared J-H and J-K colors of L dwarfs and hot EGPs,
while a warming up of the deep atmosphere along the L to T transition, as the
CO/CH4 instability vanishes, naturally solves the two aforementioned puzzles,
and provides a physical explanation of the L to T transition. This new picture
leads to a drastic revision of our understanding of BD and EGP atmospheres and

We model cells as spherical active force dipoles surrounded by an infinite
elastic matrix, and analytically evaluate the interaction energy for different
scenarios of their regulatory behavior. We obtain attraction for homeostatic
(set point) forces and repulsion for homeostatic displacements. When the
translational motion of the cells is regulated, the interaction energy decays
with distance as $1/d^4$, while when it is not regulated the energy decays as
$1/d^6$. This arises from the same reasons as the van der Waals interaction
between induced electric dipoles.

allowed state sequences is considered, and a single-letter characterization of
its correlated-random (CR) assisted semantic-security (SS) capacity is derived.
The allowed state sequences are the ones in a typical set around a single
constraining type. SS is established by showing that the mutual information
between the message and the eavesdropper's observations is negligible even when
maximized over all message distributions, choices of state sequences and
realizations of the CR-code. Both the achievability and the converse proofs of
the type constrained coding theorem rely on stronger claims than actually
required. The direct part establishes a novel single-letter lower bound on the
CR-assisted SS-capacity of an AVWTC with state sequences constrained by any
convex and closed set of state probability mass functions. This bound achieves
the best known single-letter secrecy rates for a corresponding compound wiretap
channel over the same constraint set. In contrast to other single-letter
results in the AVWTC literature, this work does not assume the existence of a
best channel to the eavesdropper. Instead, SS follows by leveraging the
heterogeneous version of the stronger soft-covering lemma and a CR-code
reduction argument. Optimality is a consequence of an max-inf upper bound on
the CR-assisted SS-capacity of an AVWTC with state sequences constrained to any
collection of type-classes. When adjusted to the aforementioned compound WTC,
the upper bound simplifies to a max-min structure, thus strengthening the
previously best known single-letter upper bound by Liang et al. that has a
min-max form. The proof of the upper bound uses a novel distribution coupling

illuminated dust particle and its gaseous environment. Its net effect in
protoplanetary discs (PPD) is the outward transport of solid bodies from hot to
cold regions. This process naturally leads to the formation of ring-shaped
features where dust piles up. In this work, we study the dynamical effects of
photophoresis in PPD by including the photophoretic force in the two-fluid
(gas+dust) smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code developed by
Barri\`ere-Fouchet et al. (2005). We find that the conditions of pressure and
temperature encountered in the inner regions of PPD result in important
photophoretic forces, which dramatically affect the radial motion of solid
bodies. Moreover, dust particles have different equilibrium locations in the
disc depending on their size and their intrinsic density. The radial transport
towards the outer parts of the disc is more efficient for silicates than for
iron particles, which has important implications for meteoritic composition.
Our results indicate that photophoresis must be taken into account in the inner
regions of PPD to fully understand the dynamics and the evolution of the dust
composition.

quiescent and star-forming galaxies. For each sample, we measure the real-space
clustering using the projected correlation function. Our calculations are
performed over the range $[0.03,10.0] h^{-1}$ Mpc, allowing us to find a
steeper trend for $r_p \lesssim 0.2 h^{-1}$ Mpc, which is especially clear for
star-forming galaxies. Our analysis also shows a clear early differentiation in
the clustering properties of both populations: star-forming galaxies show
weaker clustering with evolution in the correlation length over the analysed
redshift range, while quiescent galaxies show stronger clustering already at
high redshifts, and no appreciable evolution. We also perform the bias
calculation where similar segregation is found, but now it is among the
quiescent galaxies where a growing evolution with redshift is clearer. These
findings clearly corroborate the well known colour-density relation, confirming
that quiescent galaxies are mainly located in dark matter halos that are more
massive than those typically populated by star-forming galaxies.

Thoo have introduced an asymptotic quadratically nonlinear integro-differential
equation for the amplitude of small perturbations of the planar discontinuity.
The local-in-time existence of smooth solutions to the Cauchy problem for the
amplitude equation was already shown. In the present paper we prove the
continuous dependence in strong norm of solutions on the initial data. This
completes the proof of the well-posedness of the problem in the classical sense
of Hadamard.

that the channel matrices for space communication channels have a particularly
simple structure that leads to statistical characteristics that are both
predictable and readily controllable using clusters of satellites as

at least $k$ induced subgraphs in a graph $G$ subject to: (i) each subgraph has

$H_i,H_j$, with $i\neq j$, $\alpha(H_i, H_j) = 0$ (i.e., $H_i,H_j$ do not
conflict). We also consider a variant that arises in clustering applications:
each subgraph of a solution must contain a set of vertices from a given
collection of sets $\mathcal{C}$, and no pair of subgraphs may share vertices
from the sets of $\mathcal{C}$. In addition, we propose similar formulations

that: i) $\Pi$ is computable in polynomial time in $n$ and ii) the function
$\alpha()$ satisfies specific conditions. Specifically, $\alpha()$ is
hereditary, applicable only to overlapping subgraphs, and computable in

about the presence of gene flow during speciation, using polymorphism data.
However, Becquet and Przeworski (2009) report that the parameter estimates
obtained by fitting the IM model are very sensitive to the model's assumptions,
including the assumption of constant gene flow until the present. This paper is
concerned with the isolation-with-initial-migration (IIM) model of
Wilkinson-Herbots (2012), which drops precisely this assumption. In the IIM
model, one ancestral population divides into two descendant subpopulations,
between which there is an initial period of gene flow and a subsequent period
of isolation. We derive a fast method of fitting an extended version of the IIM
model, which allows for asymmetric gene flow and unequal subpopulation sizes.
This is a maximum-likelihood method, applicable to observations on the number
of different sites between pairs of DNA sequences from a large number of
independent loci. In addition to obtaining parameter estimates, our method can
also be used to distinguish between alternative models representing different
evolutionary cenarios, by means of likelihood ratio tests. We illustrate the
procedure on pairs of Drosophila sequences from approximately 30,000 loci. The
computing time needed to fit the most complex version of the model to this data
set is only a couple of minutes. The code to fit the IIM model can be found in
the supplementary files of this paper.

galaxies. The jet in 3C 273 is highly relativistic on sub-parsec scales, with
apparent proper motions up to 15$c$ observed by VLBI (Lister et al., 2013). In
contrast, we find that the kpc-scale knots are compatible with being
stationary, with a mean speed of $-$0.2$\pm$0.5$c$ over the whole jet. Assuming
the knots are packets of moving plasma, an upper limit of 1c implies a bulk
Lorentz factor $\Gamma<$2.9. This suggests that the jet has either decelerated
significantly by the time it reaches the kpc scale, or that the knots in the
jet are standing shock features. The second scenario is incompatible with the
inverse Compton off the Cosmic Microwave Background (IC/CMB) model for the
X-ray emission of these knots, which requires the knots to be in motion, but
IC/CMB is also disfavored in the first scenario due to energetic
considerations, in agreement with the recent finding of Meyer & Georganopoulos

produces a cloud of ejecta which exerts a thrust on the NEO, deflecting it from
its original trajectory. Ablation may be performed from afar by illuminating an
Earth-targeting asteroid or comet with a stand-off ""DE- STAR"" system consisting
of a large phased-array laser in Earth orbit. Alternatively, a much smaller
stand-on ""DE-STARLITE"" system may travel alongside the target, slowly
deflecting it from nearby over a long period. This paper presents orbital
simulations comparing the effectiveness of both systems across a range of laser
and NEO parameters. Simulated parameters include magnitude, duration and, for
the stand-on system, direction of the thrust, as well as the type, size and
orbital characteristics of the target NEO. These simulations indicate that
deflection distance is approximately proportional to the magnitude of thrust
and to the square of the duration of ablation, and is inversely proportional to
the mass. Furthermore, deflection distance shows strong dependence on thrust
direction with the optimal direction of thrust varying with the duration of
laser activity. As one example, consider a typical 325 m asteroid: beginning 15
yr in advance, just 2 N of thrust from a ~20 kW stand-on DE-STARLITE system is
sufficient to deflect the asteroid by 2 R_e. Numerous scenarios are discussed

al. It is here used to find an expression for the \it shift \rm of the energy
levels, caused by the interaction, rather than the perturbed spectrum itself.
In the limit of high energy (large quantum number $n$ of the H.O.) this shift
is shown to be given by $-2\frac{\delta}{\pi}$, also valid in the limit of
infinite as well as zero scattering length at all H.O. energies.
  Numerical investigation shows that the shifts differ from the exact result of
Busch et al, by less than $<\frac{1}{2}\%$ except for $n=0$ when it can be as
large as $\approx 2.5\%$.
  This approximation for the energy-shift is well known from another exactly

wall connecting two vortices in condensates of atoms occupying different spin

on the numerical solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations, are compared with
the predictions of an analytical macroscopic model and are discussed as a
function of the size of the pair, the Rabi coupling and the inter-component

disintegration of the domain wall into smaller pieces, connecting vortices of
new-created vortex pairs. The resulting scenario is the analogue of quark
confinement and string breaking in quantum chromodynamics.

another benchmark scenario in which $\Phi$ is a superposition of (nearly)

two-Higgs doublet model also with additional fermions to account for the
$\gamma \gamma$ decay rate. We explore the implications of these benchmark

future runs of the LHC and beyond, at higher-energy $pp$ colliders and at $e^+

theory, we define mixed-state form factors of $U(1)$ twist fields. We consider
mixed states with density matrices diagonal in the asymptotic particle basis.
This includes the thermal Gibbs state as well as all generalized Gibbs
ensembles of the Dirac theory. When the mixed state is specialized to a thermal
Gibbs state, using a Riemann-Hilbert problem and low-temperature expansion, we
obtain finite-temperature form factors of $U(1)$ twist fields. We then propose
the expression for form factors of $U(1)$ twist fields in general diagonal
mixed states. We verify that these form factors satisfy a system of nonlinear
functional differential equations, which is derived from the trace definition
of mixed-state form factors. At last, under weak analytic conditions on the
eigenvalues of the density matrix, we write down the large distance form factor
expansions of two-point correlation functions of these twist fields. Using the
relation between the Dirac and Ising models, this provides the large-distance
expansion of the R$\acute{\text{e}}$nyi entropy (for integer
R$\acute{\text{e}}$nyi parameter) in the Ising model in diagonal mixed states.

n=3 Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) phase that consists of trilayer networks of square
planar Ni ions, formally assigned as Ni1+ and Ni2+ in a 2:1 ratio. While
previous studies on polycrystalline samples have identified a 105 K phase
transition with a pronounced electronic and magnetic response but weak lattice
character, no consensus on the origin of this transition has been reached. Here
we show using synchrotron x-ray diffraction on high-pO2 floating-zone grown
single crystals that this transition is driven by a real space ordering of
charge into a quasi-2D charge stripe ground state. The charge stripe
superlattice propagation vector, q=(2/3, 0, 1), corresponds with that found in
the related 1/3-hole doped single layer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate,
La5/3Sr1/3NiO4 (LSNO-1/3, Ni2.33+) with orientation at 45-degrees to the Ni-O
bonds. Like LSNO-1/3, the charge stripes in La-438 are weakly correlated along
the c axis to form a staggered ABAB stacking that minimizes the Coulomb
repulsion among the stripes. Surprisingly, however, we find that the charge
stripes within each trilayer of La-438 are stacked in phase from one layer to
the next, at odds with any simple Coulomb repulsion argument.

  Waveforms",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Super-resolution is generally referred to as the task of recovering fine
details from coarse information. Motivated by applications such as
single-molecule imaging, radar imaging, etc., we consider parameter estimation
of complex exponentials from their modulations with unknown waveforms, allowing
for non-stationary blind super-resolution. This problem, however, is ill-posed
since both the parameters associated with the complex exponentials and the
modulating waveforms are unknown. To alleviate this, we assume that the unknown
waveforms live in a common low-dimensional subspace. Using a lifting trick, we
recast the blind super-resolution problem as a structured low-rank matrix
recovery problem. Atomic norm minimization is then used to enforce the
structured low-rankness, and is reformulated as a semidefinite program that is
solvable in polynomial time. We show that, up to scaling ambiguities, exact
recovery of both of the complex exponential parameters and the unknown
waveforms is possible when the waveform subspace is random and the number of
measurements is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom in the
problem. Numerical simulations support our theoretical findings, showing that
non-stationary blind super-resolution using atomic norm minimization is
possible.

decades from the ground and the Hubble Space Telescope, and the newly acquired

Ceres, in both a global scale and local regions, particularly the bright spots
inside Occator crater, over time scales of a few months to decades. Our
analysis has placed an upper limit on the possible temporal albedo variation on
Ceres. Sporadic water vapor venting, or any possibly ongoing activity on Ceres,
is not significant enough to change the albedo or the area of the bright
features in Occator crater by >15%, or the global albedo by >3% over various
time scales that we searched. Recently reported spectral slope variations can
be explained by changing Sun-Ceres-Earth geometry. The active area on Ceres is
less than 1 km$^2$, too small to cause global albedo and spectral variations
detectable in our data. Impact ejecta due to impacting projectiles of tens of
meters in size like those known to cause observable changes to the surface
albedo on Asteroid Scheila cannot cause detectable albedo change on Ceres due
to its relatively large size and strong gravity. The water vapor activity on
Ceres is independent of Ceres' heliocentric distance, rulling out the
possibility of comet-like sublimation process as a possible mechanism driving
the activity.

gravitational waves from the merger of two stellar-mass compact objects a
realistic prospect. Evolutionary scenarios towards mergers of double compact
objects generally invoke common-envelope evolution which is poorly understood,
leading to large uncertainties in merger rates. We explore the alternative
scenario of massive overcontact binary (MOB) evolution, which involves two very
massive stars in a very tight binary which remain fully mixed due to their
tidally induced high spin. We use the public stellar-evolution code MESA to
systematically study this channel by means of detailed simulations. We find
that, at low metallicity, MOBs produce double-black-hole (BH+BH) systems that
will merge within a Hubble time with mass ratios close to one, in two mass
ranges, ~25...60msun and >~ 130msun, with pair instability supernovae (PISNe)
being produced in-between. Our models are also able to reproduce counterparts
of various stages in the MOB scenario in the local Universe, providing direct
support for it. We map the initial parameter space that produces BH+BH mergers,
determine the expected chirp mass distribution, merger times, Kerr parameters
and predict event rates. We typically find that for Z~<Z_sun/10, there is one
BH+BH merger for ~1000 core-collapse supernovae. The advanced LIGO (aLIGO)
detection rate is more uncertain and depends on the metallicity evolution.
Deriving upper and lower limits from a local and a global approximation for the
metallicity distribution of massive stars, we estimate aLIGO detection rates
(at design limit) of ~19-550 yr^(-1) for BH+BH mergers below the PISN gap and
of ~2.1-370 yr^(-1) above the PISN gap. Even with conservative assumptions, we
find that aLIGO should soon detect BH+BH mergers from the MOB scenario and that
these could be the dominant source for aLIGO detections.

there is not at present a mathematical explanation of these phenomena, valid
for general signals in L^2 and, more in general, in the space S' of temperate

approach to bounding rates of convergence and proving tail inequalities for the
empirical spectral measures of a wide variety of random matrix ensembles. We
illustrate the approach by proving asymptotically almost sure rates of
convergence of the empirical spectral measure in the following ensembles:
Wigner matrices, Wishart matrices, Haar-distributed matrices from the compact
classical groups, powers of Haar matrices, randomized sums and random
compressions of Hermitian matrices, a random matrix model for the Hamiltonians
of quantum spin glasses, and finally the complex Ginibre ensemble. Many of the
results appeared previously and are being collected and described here as
illustrations of the general method; however, some details (particularly in the
Wigner and Wishart cases) are new.
  Our approach makes use of techniques from probability in Banach spaces, in
particular concentration of measure and bounds for suprema of stochastic
processes, in combination with more classical tools from matrix analysis,
approximation theory, and Fourier analysis. It is highly flexible, as evidenced
by the broad list of examples. It is moreover based largely on ""soft"" methods,

a wedge-shaped spherical shell, where the interplay between convection and
rotation self-consistently drives a large-scale dynamo. To analyze the dynamo
mechanism we apply the test-field method for azimuthally ($\phi$) averaged
fields to determine the 27 turbulent transport coefficients of the
electromotive force, of which six are related to the $\alpha$ tensor. This
method has previously been used either in simulations in Cartesian coordinates
or in the geodynamo context and is applied here for the first time to fully
compressible simulations of solar-like dynamos. We find that the
$\phi\phi$-component of the $\alpha$ tensor does not follow the profile
expected from that of kinetic helicity. The turbulent pumping velocities
significantly alter the effective mean flows acting on the magnetic field and
therefore challenge the flux transport dynamo concept. All coefficients are
significantly affected by dynamically important magnetic fields. Quenching as
well as enhancement are being observed. This leads to a modulation of the
coefficients with the activity cycle. The temporal variations are found to be
comparable to the time-averaged values and seem to be responsible for a
nonlinear feedback on the magnetic field generation. Furthermore, we quantify
the validity of the Parker-Yoshimura rule for the equatorward propagation of
the mean magnetic field in the present case.

dispersion of 9.8 km/s, translates to a Mach number, M_3D>28. The gas is
distributed throughout several ""streams"", with projected lengths ~100-250 pc.
We link the streams to individual clouds and sub-regions, including Sgr C, the
20 and 50 km/s clouds, the dust ridge, and Sgr B2. Shell-like emission features
can be explained by the projection of independent molecular clouds in Sgr C and
the newly identified conical profile of Sgr B2 in {l ,b, v_LSR} space. These
features have previously invoked supernova-driven shells and cloud-cloud
collisions as explanations. We instead caution against structure identification
in velocity-integrated emission maps. Three geometries describing the 3-D

elliptical orbit; iii) an open stream. While two spiral arms and an open stream
qualitatively reproduce the gas distribution, the most recent parameterisation
of the closed elliptical orbit does not. Finally, we discuss how proper motion
measurements of masers can distinguish between these geometries, and suggest
that this effort should be focused on the 20 km/s and 50 km/s clouds and Sgr C.

curvature perturbation $\zeta$ due to quantum decoherence, focusing on the role
played by squeezed-limit mode couplings. We evolve the quantum state $\Psi$ in
the Schr\""odinger picture, for a generic cubic coupling to additional
environment degrees of freedom. Focusing on the case of minimal gravitational
interactions, we find the evolution of the reduced density matrix for a given
long-wavelength fluctuation by tracing out the other (mostly shorterwavelength)
modes of $\zeta$ as an environment. We show that inflation produces phase
oscillations in the wave functional $\Psi[\zeta(\mathbf{x})]$, which suppress
off-diagonal components of the reduced density matrix, leaving a diagonal
mixture of different classical configurations. Gravitational nonlinearities
thus provide a minimal mechanism for generating classical stochastic
perturbations from inflation. We identify the time when decoherence occurs,
which is delayed after horizon crossing due to the weak coupling, and find that
Hubble-scale modes act as the decohering environment. We also comment on the
observational relevance of decoherence and its relation to the squeezing of the

material producing the emission moves at relativistic speed, then the
variability of the resulting light curve depends on the viewing angle. This is
due to the fact that the pulse evolution time scale is Doppler contracted,
while the pulse separation is not. For off-axis viewing angles $\theta_{\rm
view} \gtrsim \theta_{\rm jet} + \Gamma^{-1}$, the pulse broadening
significantly smears out the light curve variability. This is largely
independent of geometry and emission processes. To explore a specific case, we
set up a simple model of a single pulse under the assumption that the pulse
rise and decay are dominated by the shell curvature effect. We show that such a
pulse observed off-axis is (i) broader, (ii) softer and (iii) displays a
different hardness-intensity correlation with respect to the same pulse seen
on-axis. For each of these effects, we provide an intuitive physical
explanation. We then show how a synthetic light curve made by a superposition
of pulses changes with increasing viewing angle. We find that a highly variable
light curve, (as seen on-axis) becomes smooth and apparently single-pulsed
(when seen off-axis) because of pulse overlap. To test the relevance of this
fact, we estimate the fraction of off-axis gamma-ray bursts detectable by
\textit{Swift} as a function of redshift, finding that a sizable fraction
(between 10\% and 80\%) of nearby ($z<0.1$) bursts are observed with
$\theta_{\rm view} \gtrsim \theta_{\rm jet} + \Gamma^{-1}$. Based on these
results, we argue that low luminosity gamma-ray bursts are consistent with
being ordinary bursts seen off-axis.

neutron star rather than a black hole. We show that the recently-discovered
example (M82 X-2) fits naturally into the simple picture of ULXs as beamed
X-ray sources fed at super-Eddington rates, provided that its magnetic field is
weaker ($\simeq 10^{11}{\rm G}$) than a new-born X-ray pulsar, as expected if
there has been mass gain. Continuing accretion is likely to weaken the field to
the point that pulsing stops, and make the system indistinguishable from a ULX
containing a black hole. Accordingly we suggest that a significant fraction of
all ULXs may actually contain neutron star accretors rather than black holes,
reflecting the neutron-star fraction among their X-ray binary progenitors. We
emphasize that neutron-star ULXs are likely to have {\it higher} apparent
luminosities than black hole ULXs for a given mass transfer rate, as their
tighter beaming outweighs their lower Eddington luminosities. This further
increases the likely proportion of neutron-star accretors among all ULXs.
Cygnus X-2 is probably a typical descendant of neutron-star ULXs, which may
therefore ultimately end as millisecond pulsar binaries with massive white
dwarf companions.

constrained assuming that the emission measure profiles at different redshift
are weakly self-similar, that is their shape is universal, explicitly allowing
for temperature and redshift dependence of the gas fraction. This cosmological
test, in combination with $Planck$+SNIa data, allows us to put a tight
constraint on the dark energy models. For a constant-$w$ model, we have
$w=-1.010\pm0.030$ and $\Omega_m=0.311\pm0.014$, while for a time-evolving

$w_0=-0.993\pm0.046$ and $w_a=-0.123\pm0.400$. Constraints on the cosmology are
further improved by adding priors on the gas fraction evolution from
hydrodynamic simulations. Current data favour the cosmological constant with
$w\equiv-1$, with no evidence for dynamic dark energy. We checked that our
method is robust towards different sources of systematics, including background
modelling, outlier measurements, selection effects, inhomogeneities of the gas

regions of galaxies have not been resolved so far, we consider two extreme
cases for temperature and density profiles. We also follow two types of
evolution for the jet cocoons: being driven by the pressure inside the cocoon
(Fanaroff-Riley [FR] I type), and being driven by the jet momentum (FR II
type). Our main result is that regardless of the assumed form of density
profiles, jets with observed powers of <~ 10^{44} erg s^{-1} are not powerful
enough to evolve as FR II sources. Instead, they evolve as FR I sources and
appear to be decelerated below the buoyant velocities of the cocoons when jets
were propagating through the central dense regions of the host galaxies. This
explains the reason why FR I sources are more frequent than FR II sources in
clusters. Furthermore, we predict the sizes of X-ray cavities from the observed
jet powers and compare them with the observed ones --- they are consistent
within a factor of two if the FR I type evolution is realized. Finally, we find
that the jets with a power >~ 10^{44} erg s^{-1} are less affected by the

symmetry protected metallic boundary states. These edge modes have been
characterised in terms of transport and spectroscopic measurements, but a
thermodynamic description has been lacking. The challenge arises because in
conventional thermodynamics the potentials are required to scale linearly with
extensive variables like volume, which does not allow for a general treatment
of boundary effects. In this paper, we overcome this challenge with Hill
thermodynamics. In this extension of the thermodynamic formalism, the grand
potential is split into an extensive, conventional contribution, and the
subdivision potential, which is the central construct of Hill's theory. For
topologically non-trivial electronic matter, the subdivision potential captures
measurable contributions to the density of states and the heat capacity: it is
the thermodynamic manifestation of the topological edge structure. Furthermore,
the subdivision potential reveals phase transitions of the edge even when they
are not manifested in the bulk, thus opening a variety of new possibilities for
investigating, manipulating, and characterizing topological quantum matter
solely in terms of equilibrium boundary physics.

$r = 0.084$ and $n_s = 0.0963$. The energy density during inflation is directly
related to the PS breaking scale, $v_{PS}$. The model also incorporates a
$\mathbb{Z}_4^R$ symmetry which can resolve the $\mu$ problem and suppress
dimension 5 operators for proton decay, leaving over an exact $R$-parity.
Finally the model allows for a complete three family extension with a $D_4$

sample of 10 nearby, gas-rich galaxies selected from the HI Parkes All-Sky
Survey (HIPASS). This follows the six HIPASS galaxies searched in previous work
and completes our full sample. In this paper we searched for absorption along
17 sightlines with impact parameters between 6 and 46 kpc, making one new
detection. We also obtained simultaneous HI emission-line data, allowing us to
directly relate the absorption-line detection rate to the HI distribution. From
this we find the majority of the non-detections in the current sample are
because sightline does not intersect the HI disc of the galaxy at sufficiently
high column density, but that source structure is also an important factor.
  The detected absorption-line arises in the galaxy NGC 5156 ($z = 0.01$) at an
impact parameter of 19 kpc. The line is deep and narrow with an integrated
optical depth of 0.82 km s$^{-1}$. High resolution Australia Telescope Compact
Array (ATCA) images at 5 and 8 GHz reveal that the background source is
resolved into two components with a separation of 2.6 arcsec (500 pc at the
redshift of the galaxy), with the absorption likely occurring against a single
component. We estimate that the ratio of the spin temperature and covering
factor, $T_{\mathrm{S}}/f$, is approximately 950 K in the outer disc of NGC
5156, but further observations using VLBI would allow us to accurately measure

exact same results as standard $k$-means; when using cover trees, we use
adaptive analysis techniques to, under some assumptions, bound the

these are the first sub-$O(kN)$ bounds for exact Lloyd iterations. We then show

Since the seminal work of Feller, we know that virtually any one dimensional,
strong, homogeneous, continuous Markov process can be uniquely characterized
via its infinitesimal generator and the generator's domain of definition.
Unlike standard diffusions like Brownian motion, processes with spatial delay
spend positive time at a single point of space. Interestingly, the set of times
that a delay process spends at its delay point is nowhere dense and forms a
positive measure Cantor set. The domain of definition of the generator has
restrictions involving second derivatives. In this article we provide a
pathwise characterization for processes with delay in terms of an SDE and an
occupation time formula involving the symmetric local time. This
characterization provides an explicit Doob-Meyer decomposition, demonstrating
that such processes are semi-martingales and that all of stochastic calculus
including It\^{o} formula and Girsanov formula applies. We also establish an
occupation time formula linking the time that the process spends at a delay
point with its symmetric local time there. A physical example of a stochastic

of magnitude additional available bandwidths to what has already been allocated

in a small footprint at mmWave bands can be leveraged to harvest massive-MIMO
type beamforming and spatial multiplexing gains. Similar to LTE systems, two
prerequisites for harvesting these benefits are detecting users and acquiring
user channel state information (CSI) in the training phase. However, due to the
fact that mmWave channels encounter much harsher propagation and decorrelate
much faster, the tasks of user detection and CSI acquisition are both
imperative and much more challenging than in LTE bands.
  In this paper, we investigate the problem of fast user detection and CSI
acquisition in the downlink of small cell mmWave networks. We assume TDD
operation and channel-reciprocity based CSI acquisition. To achieve
densification benefits we propose pilot designs and channel estimators that
leverage a combination of aggressive pilot reuse with fast user detection at
the base station and compressed sensing channel estimation. As our simulations
show, the number of users that can be simultaneously served by the entire

realistic interactions among them has been a long-standing goal in nuclear
physics. In addition to the complex nature of the nuclear forces, with two-,
three- and possibly higher many-nucleon components, one faces the
quantum-mechanical many-nucleon problem governed by an interplay between bound
and continuum states. In recent years, significant progress has been made in ab
initio nuclear structure and reaction calculations based on input from
QCD-employing Hamiltonians constructed within chiral effective field theory.
After a brief overview of the field, we focus on ab initio many-body approaches
- built upon the No-Core Shell Model - that are capable of simultaneously
describing both bound and scattering nuclear states, and present results for
resonances in light nuclei, reactions important for astrophysics and fusion
research. In particular, we review recent calculations of resonances in the
$^6$He halo nucleus, of five- and six-nucleon scattering, and an investigation
of the role of chiral three-nucleon interactions in the structure of $^9$Be.
Further, we discuss applications to the $^7$Be$(p,\gamma)^8$B radiative
capture. Finally, we highlight our efforts to describe transfer reactions
including the $^3$H$(d,n)^4$He fusion.

the intensity incident on an accretion disk to the observed intensity is
relxill. The parameter used in earlier versions of this model, referred to as
the reflection strength, is unsatisfactory, and it has been superseded by a
parameter that provides insight into the accretion geometry, namely the
reflection fraction. The reflection fraction is defined as the ratio of the
coronal intensity illuminating the disk to the coronal intensity that reaches
the observer. The relxill model combines a general relativistic ray-tracing
code and a photoionization code to compute the component of radiation reflected
from an accretion that is illuminated by an internal source. The reflection
fraction is a particularly important parameter for relativistic models with
well-defined geometry, such as the lamppost model, which is a focus of this
paper. Relativistic spectra are compared for three inclinations and for four
values of the key parameter of the lamppost model, namely the height above the
black hole of the illuminating, on-axis point source. In all cases, the
strongest reflection is produced for low source heights and high spin. A
low-spin black hole is shown to be incapable of producing enhanced relativistic
reflection. Results for the relxill model are compared to those obtained with
other models and a Monte Carlo simulation. Fitting data using the relxill model
and the recently implemented parameter the reflection fraction, one can
constrain the geometry of a system, under the assumption of a lamppost-like
accretion geometry. The reflection fraction is independent of such system
parameters as inclination and black hole spin. The reflection fraction
parameter was implemented with the name refl_frac in all flavors of the relxill
model, and the nonrelativistic reflection model xillver, in v0.4a (18 January
2016).

investigations, we show that there is evidence of a ""squeezing phenomenon"",

spirals towards the primary. This causes an increase in the accretion rates
that always exceed the Eddington rate. We have studied the main features of the

the effects of numerical resolution, the secondary accretion radius and the
disc thickness. With our disc model with a low aspect ratio, we show that the
mass expelled from the orbit of the secondary is negligible ($< 5\%$ of the
initial disc mass), different to the findings of previous 2D simulations with
thicker discs. The increase in the accretion rates in the last stages of the
merger leads to an increase in luminosity, making it possible to detect an
electromagnetic precursor of the gravitational wave signal emitted by the

field and carrying a chiral charge asymmetry, which might arise in the early
Universe through baryogenesis. It is known that on large length scales,
$\lambda \gtrsim 1/(\alpha \mu_5)$, the chiral anomaly opens an instability
toward the erasure of chiral charge and growth of magnetic helicity. Here the
chemical potential $\mu_{5}$ parametrizes the chiral asymmetry and $\alpha$ is
the fine-structure constant. We study the process of chiral charge erasure
through the thermal fluctuations of magnetic helicity and contrast with the
well-studied phenomenon of Chern-Simons number diffusion. Through the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem we estimate the amplitude and time scale of
helicity fluctuations on the length scale $\lambda$, finding $\delta
\mathcal{H} \sim \lambda T$ and $\tau \sim \alpha \lambda^3 T^2$ for a
relativistic plasma at temperature $T$. We argue that the presence of a chiral
asymmetry allows the helicity to grow diffusively for a time $t \sim
T^3/(\alpha^5 \mu_5^4)$ until it reaches an equilibrium value $\mathcal{H} \sim
\mu_{5} T^2 / \alpha$, and the chiral asymmetry is partially erased. If the
chiral asymmetry is small, $\mu_5 < T/\alpha$, this avenue for chiral charge
erasure is found to be slower than the chiral magnetic effect for which $t \sim
T / (\alpha^3 \mu_{5}^2)$. This mechanism for chiral charge erasure can be
important for the hypercharge sector of the Standard Model as well as
extensions including ${\rm U}(1)$ gauge interactions, such as asymmetric dark
matter models.

about flow conditions. Deciphering quantitative information from tsunami
deposits is especially important for analyzing paleo-tsunami events in which
deposits comprise the only leftover physical evidence. The physical meaning of
the deciphered quantities depends on the physical assumptions that are applied.
The aim of our study is to estimate the characteristics of tsunamis and
quantify the errors and uncertainties that inherent within them. To achieve
this goal, we apply the TSUFLIND-EnKF inversion model to study the deposition
of an idealized deposit created by a single tsunami wave and one real case from
2004 India ocean tsunami. TSUFLIND-EnKF model combines TSUFLIND for the
deposition module with the Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) method. In our
modeling, we assume that grain-size distribution and thickness from the
idealized deposits at different depths can be used as an observational
variable. Our tentative results indicate that sampling methods and sampling
frequencies of tsunami deposits influence not only the magnitude of the
inverted variables, but also their errors and uncertainties. An interesting
result of our technique is that a larger number of samples from a given tsunami
deposit does not automatically mean that the inversion results are more robust
with smaller errors and decreased uncertainties.

immersed in a dielectric medium the photon radiation pressure is proportional
to the medium refractive index n. Our work thus contributes to the longstanding

ActiveClean, a progressive cleaning approach where the model is updated
incrementally instead of re-training and can guarantee accuracy on partially

improve model accuracy by up-to 2.5x for the same amount of data cleaned.

arranged as layers of single line of computing units called neurons. This
special structure requires the non-vectorial inputs such as matrices to be
converted into vectors. This process can be problematic. Firstly, the spatial
information among elements of the data may be lost during vectorisation.
Secondly, the solution space becomes very large which demands very special
treatments to the network parameters and high computational cost. To address
these issues, we propose matrix neural networks (MatNet), which takes matrices
directly as inputs. Each neuron senses summarised information through bilinear
mapping from lower layer units in exactly the same way as the classic feed
forward neural networks. Under this structure, back prorogation and gradient
descent combination can be utilised to obtain network parameters efficiently.
Furthermore, it can be conveniently extended for multimodal inputs. We apply
MatNet to MNIST handwritten digits classification and image super resolution
tasks to show its effectiveness. Without too much tweaking MatNet achieves
comparable performance as the state-of-the-art methods in both tasks with
considerably reduced complexity.

long-term monitoring of its stellar radial velocities. Both of these

$1.21\pm0.26\,M_\odot$ and that the disk and binary orbital planes are aligned
within $3^\circ$ (at 3$\sigma$ confidence). The predictions of various
theoretical models for pre-main sequence stellar evolution are also consistent

lingering uncertainties in the photospheric properties of the individual

primordial density perturbations was constructed using a consistent truncation
of the D-brane dynamics from Type IIB string theory. A coupling was introduced
between the tachyon field and the adjoint Higgs field on the D3-branes to lock
the tachyon at the top of its potential hill and to model the bounce process,
which is known as the Coupled Scalar and Tachyon Bounce (CSTB) Universe. The
CSTB model has been shown to be ghost free, and it fulfils the null energy

problem. In this paper we conduct an extensive follow-up study of the parameter
space of the CSTB model. In particular we are interested in the parameter
values that can produce a single bounce to arrive at a radiation-dominated
universe. We further establish that the CSTB universe is a viable alternative
to inflation, as it can naturally produce a sufficient number of e-foldings in
the locked inflation epoch and in the post-bounce expansion to overcome the
four fundamental limitations of the Big Bang cosmology, which are flatness,
horizon, homogeneity and singularity, resulting in a universe of the current
size.

the data removing the stray light contamination, and spectropolarimetric
inversions that will provide the vertical stratification of the atmospheric
physical parameters where the observed spectral lines form. We inverted the
Stokes profiles using a two component configuration, obtaining that one
component is strongly blueshifted and displays a temperature enhancement at
upper photospheric layers while the second component has low redshifted
velocities and it is cool at upper layers. In addition, we examined a large
number of cases located at different heliocentric angles, finding smaller
velocities as we move from the centre to the edge of the granule. Moreover, the
height location of the enhancement on the temperature stratification of the

gas-kinetic scheme (DUGKS) methods for direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the
decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence (DHIT) in a periodic box. The flow
fields and key statistical quantities computed by both methods are compared
with those from pseudo-spectral (PS) method. The results show that the LBE and
DUGKS have almost the same accuracy when the flow field is well-resolved, and
that the LBE is less dissipative and is slightly more efficient than the DUGKS,
but the latter has a superior numerical stability, particularly for high
Reynolds number flows. Therefore, the DUGKS method can be viewed as a viable
tool for DNS of turbulent flows. It should be emphasized that the main
advantage of the DUGKS when compared with the LBE method is its feasibility in
adopting nonuniform meshes, which is critical for wall-bounded turbulent flows.
The present work provides a basis for further applications of DUGKS in studying
the physics of the turbulent flows.

cannot occur and synchronization is absent. Here we explore the effects of
correlating the disorder. Specifically, we assume that any given oscillator
either attracts or repels all the others, and that the sign of the interaction
is deterministically correlated with the given oscillator's natural frequency.
For symmetrically correlated disorder with zero mean, we find that the system
spontaneously synchronizes, once the width of the frequency distribution falls
below a critical value. For asymmetrically correlated disorder, the model
displays coherent traveling waves: the complex order parameter becomes nonzero
and rotates with constant frequency different from the system's mean natural
frequency. Thus, in both cases, correlated disorder can trigger phase
coherence.

to search for Mott-insulating state. Recently, a combined experimental and
theoretical study [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 247602 (2015)] of the two-dimensional
(2D) Sn atom lattice on a wide-gap SiC(0001) substrate proposed a Mott-type
insulator driven by strong on-site Coulomb repulsion U. Our systematic
density-functional theory (DFT) study with local, semilocal, and hybrid
exchange-correlation functionals shows that the Sn dangling-bond state largely
hybridizes with the substrate Si 3p and C 2p states to split into three surface
bands due to the crystal field. Such a hybridization gives rise to the
stabilization of the antiferromagnetic order via superexchange interactions.
The band gap and the density of states predicted by the hybrid DFT calculation
agree well with photoemission data. Our findings not only suggest that the
Sn/SiC(0001) system can be represented as a Slater-type insulator driven by
long-range magnetism, but also have an implication that taking into account

bag-of-words frameworks. The approach learns a codeword in bag-of-words model
from a pair of matched features from two consecutive frames, such that the
codeword has temporally-derived perspective invariance to camera motion. The
learning algorithm is efficient: the binary descriptor is generated from the
mean image patch, and the mask is learned based on discriminative projection by
minimizing the intra-class distances among the learned feature and the two
original features. A codeword for bag-of-words models is generated by packaging
the learned descriptor and mask, with a masked Hamming distance defined to
measure the distance between two codewords. The geometric properties of the
learned codewords are then mathematically justified. In addition, hypothesis
constraints are imposed through temporal consistency in matched codewords,
which improves precision. The approach, integrated in an incremental
bag-of-words system, is validated on multiple benchmark data sets and compared
to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments demonstrate improved precision/recall
outperforming state of the art with little loss in runtime.

forced oscillations by external perturbations in the ambient interstellar
medium. Linear analysis shows that the blast wave can amplify density and
vorticity perturbations for a wide range of length scales with amplification
coefficients of up to 20, with amplification the greater, the larger the
length. There also exist resonant harmonics for which the gain becomes formally
infinite in the linear approximation. Their orbital wavenumbers are within the
range of macro- ($l \sim 1$), meso- ($l \sim 20$) and microscopic ($l > 200$)

resonance should select and amplify discrete isolated harmonics. We speculate

different statistical behaviour from the standard MHD one and is unable to
amplify seed magnetic fields, in disagreement with previous cosmological MHD
simulations which are successful to explain the observed magnetic fields in the

electroweak precision measurements at the FCC-ee -- the Future Circular
Collider with electron-positron beams -- would provide improvements by orders
of magnitude over the present status and constitute a broad search for the
existence of new, weakly interacting particles up to very high energy scales.
The FCC-ee will address centre-of-mass energies ranging from below the Z pole
to the $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ threshold and above. At energies around the Z pole,
the Z-boson mass and width can be measured to better than 100 keV each.
Asymmetry measurements at the Z pole allow improvements in the determination of
the weak mixing angle by at least a factor 30 to
$\delta\sin^2\theta\mathrm{_W^{eff}}\simeq 6\times 10^{-6}$. A determination of
the electromagnetic coupling constant at the Z energy scale,
$\alpha_\mathrm{QED}(m_\mathrm{Z}^2)$, to a relative precision of $3\times
10^{-5}$ can be obtained via measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry of
lepton pairs at two energy points $\pm 3.2\,\textrm{GeV}$ away from the Z peak.
At energies around the WW threshold, high-statistic cross section measurements
can provide a determination of the W mass to 300 keV. The key breakthrough
advantage of the FCC-ee in these achievements, beside the large luminosity, is
the possibility of a continous, precise determination of the beam energy by
resonant depolarization at the Z peak and at the WW threshold. Precise
measurements of the hadronic branching fractions of the Z and W bosons allow
for considerably improvements in the determination of the strong coupling
constant down to a precision of $\delta\alpha_\mathrm{s}(m_\mathrm{Z}^2)\simeq
0.0001$. An energy scan around the 350 GeV $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ threshold allows
a 10 MeV measurement of the top-quark mass.

the helical edge modes is strong compared to the interaction within each mode,
a spin-density wave forms, with emergent topological properties. Firstly, the
gap protects the conducting phase against localization by weak nonmagnetic

real-time on the cloud and incur extra costs even before an application is

  In this paper, we present lightweight cloud benchmarking techniques that
execute quickly and can be used in near real-time on the cloud. The exploration
of lightweight benchmarking techniques are facilitated by the development of
DocLite - Docker Container-based Lightweight Benchmarking. DocLite is built on
the Docker container technology which allows a user-defined portion (such as
memory size and the number of CPU cores) of the VM to be benchmarked. DocLite
operates in two modes, in the first mode, containers are used to benchmark a
small portion of the VM to generate performance ranks. In the second mode,
historic benchmark data is used along with the first mode as a hybrid to
generate VM ranks. The generated ranks are evaluated against three scientific
high-performance computing applications. The proposed techniques are up to 91
times faster than a heavyweight technique which benchmarks the entire VM. It is
observed that the first mode can generate ranks with over 90% and 86% accuracy
for sequential and parallel execution of an application. The hybrid mode
improves the correlation slightly but the first mode is sufficient for
benchmarking cloud VMs.

within a quasilinear analytic theory of driven turbulence and by nonlinear
simulations of magnetoconvection that the resulting small-scale current
helicity has the same sign as the large-scale current helicity while the ratio
of both pseudo-scalars is of the order of the magnetic Reynolds number of the

intermediate coupling to the reservoir, the Kondo effect can develop in the
normal state and screen the local magnetic moment of the dot. This leads to
singlet-doublet transitions that strongly affect the Josephson effect in a
single-level quantum dot: the sign of the supercurrent changes from positive to
negative (0 to $\pi$-junction). In the regime of strongest competition between
the Kondo effect and proximity effect, meaning that the Kondo temperature
equals the superconducting gap, the magnetic state of the dot undergoes a first
order quantum transition induced by the superconducting phase difference across
the junction. This is revealed experimentally by anharmonic current-phase
relations. In addition, the very specific electronic configuration of clean
carbon nanotubes, with two nearly orbitally degenerated states, leads to
different physics depending whether only one or both quasi-degenerate upper
levels of the dots participate to transport, which is determined by their

processes are most frequently described by the Negative Binomial Distribution

become more and more apparent. They are usually attributed to the possible
multi-source structure of the production process and described using a
multi-NBD form of the multiplicity distribution. We investigate the possibility
of keeping a single NBD but with its parameters depending on the multiplicity
$N$. This is done by modifying the widely known clan model of particle
production leading to the NBD form of $P(N)$. This is then confronted with the
approach based on the so-called cascade-stochastic formalism which is based on
different types of recurrence relations defining $P(N)$. We demonstrate that a
combination of both approaches allows the retrieval of additional valuable
information from the multiplicity distributions, namely the oscillatory
behavior of the counting statistics apparently visible in the high energy data.

Cosmic Topology, has become testable by astronomical observations, especially
the data from the Cosmic Microwave Background (hereafter CMB) obtained by WMAP

features and more local geometrical properties such as curvature. It deals with
questions such as whether space is finite or infinite, simply-connected or
multi-connected, and smaller or greater than its observable counterpart. A
striking feature of some relativistic, multi-connected small universe models is
to create multiples images of faraway cosmic sources. While the last CMB

model, they remain consistent with more complex shapes such as the spherical
Poincare Dodecahedral Space, the flat hypertorus or the hyperbolic Picard horn.

is complex with nonlinearities involved both at the excitation level (acoustic
streaming and radiation pressure) and in the droplet response (nonlinear
oscillations and contact line dynamics). In this paper, we investigate the
dynamics of sessile and pendant drops excited by SAWs. For pendant drops,
so-far unreported dynamics are observed close to the drop detachment threshold
with the suppression of the translational motion. Away from this threshold, the
comparison between pendant and sessile drop dynamics allows us to identify the
role played by gravity or more generally by an initial or dynamically induced
stretching of the drop. In turn, we elucidate the origin of the resonance
frequency shift, as well as the origin of the strong correlation between
oscillatory and translational motion. We show that for sessile drops, the
velocity is mainly determined by the amplitude of oscillation and that the
saturation observed is due to the nonlinear dependence of the drop response

been the subject of many investigations. On the experimental side different
experiments have looked for its spin partners and the bottom analogs. On the
theoretical side different approaches have been used to understand this state.
Some of them are EFT that impose HQSS and so they make predictions for the
partners of the $X(3872)$, suggesting the existence of a $J^{PC}=2^{++}$
partner in the charm sector or $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ or $2^{++}$ analogs in the
bottom.
  In our work, in order to understand the $X(3872)$, we use a Chiral quark
model in which, due to the proximity to the $DD^*$ threshold, we include $c\bar
c$ states coupled to $DD^*$ molecular components. In this coupled channel model
the relative position of the bare $c\bar c$ states with two meson thresholds
are very important. We have looked for the $X(3872)$ partners and we don't find
a bound state in the $D^*D^*$ $J^{PC}=2^{++}$. In the bottom sector we find the
opposite situation where the $B^*B^*$ with $J^{PC}=2^{++}$ is bounded while the
$J^{PC}=1^{++}$ is not bounded. These results shows how the coupling with
$c\bar c$ states can induced different results than those expected by HQSS. The
reason is that this symmetry is worse in the open heavy meson sector than in

drag due to Compton scattering of ambient photons by relativistic electrons
accelerated in reconnecting current sheets is studied. It is found that the
efficiency at which magnetic energy is converted to radiation is limited to a
maximum value of $\epsilon_c=3l_{dis}\,\sigma_0/4(\sigma_0+1)$, where
$\sigma_0$ is the initial magnetization of the flow and $l_{dis}\le1$ the
fraction of initial Poynting flux that can dissipate. The asymptotic Lorentz
factor satisfies $\Gamma_\infty\ge\Gamma_0(1+l_{dis}\,\sigma_0/4)$, where
$\Gamma_0$ is the initial Lorentz factor. This limit is approached in cases
where the cooling time is shorter than the local dissipation time. A somewhat
smaller radiative efficiency is expected if radiative losses are dominated by
synchrotron and SSC emissions. It is suggested that under certain conditions
magnetic field dissipation may occur in two distinct phases: On small scales,
asymmetric magnetic fields that are advected into the polar region and dragged
out by the outflow dissipate to a more stable configuration. The dissipated
energy is released predominantly as gamma rays. On much larger scales, the
outflow encounters a flat density profile medium and re-collimates. This leads
to further dissipation and wobbling of the jet head by the kink instability, as
found recently in 3D MHD simulations. Within the framework of a model proposed
recently to explain the dichotomy of radio loud AGN, this scenario can account
for the unification of gamma-ray blazars with FRI and FRII radio sources.

generates synchrony between isolated single species populations, to the study
of synchrony between populations embedded in multi-species communities. In
laboratory experiments on complex microbial communities, comprising both
predators (protozoa) and prey (bacteria), we observe synchrony in abundances
between isolated replicates. A breakdown in synchrony occurs for both predator
and prey as the reactor dilution rate increases, which corresponds to both an
increased rate of input of external resources and an increased effective
mortality though washout. The breakdown is more rapid, however, for the lower
trophic level. We can explain this phenomenon using a mathematical framework
for determining synchrony between populations in multi-species communities at
equilibrium. We assume that there are multiple sources of environmental noise
with different degrees of correlation that affect the individual species
population dynamics differently. The deterministic dynamics can then influence
the degree of synchrony between species in different communities. In the case
of a stable equilibrium community synchrony is controlled by the eigenvalue
with smallest negative real part. Intuitively fluctuations are minimally damped
in this direction. We show that the experimental observations are consistent
with this framework but only for multiplicative noise.

alternative volume integral formula $J_{\rm var}[\Phi]$ are used to compute the
asymptotic exchange splitting of the interaction energy of the hydrogen atom
and a proton employing the primitive function $\Phi$ in the form of its
truncated multipole expansion. Closed-form formulas are obtained for the
asymptotics of $J_{\rm surf}[\Phi_N]$ and $J_{\rm var}[\Phi_N]$, where $\Phi_N$
is the multipole expansion of $\Phi$ truncated after the $1/R^N$ term, $R$
being the internuclear separation. It is shown that the obtained sequences of
approximations converge to the exact results with the rate corresponding to the
convergence radius equal to 2 and 4 when the surface and the volume integral
formulas are used, respectively. When the multipole expansion of a truncated,
$K$th order polarization function is used to approximate the primitive function
the convergence radius becomes equal to unity in the case of
$J_{\textrm{var}}[\Phi]$. At low order the observed convergence of $J_{\rm
var}[\Phi_N]$ is, however, geometric and switches to harmonic only at certain
value of $N=N_c$ dependent on $K$. An equation for $N_c$ is derived which very
well reproduces the observed $K$-dependent convergence pattern. The results
shed new light on the convergence properties of the conventional SAPT expansion

to two main challenges: (i) making timely estimates of varying content
popularity and (ii) inferring popular content from small samples. We propose a
framework which alleviates such limitations.
  To timely estimate varying popularity in a context of a single cache we
propose an Age-Based Threshold (ABT) policy which caches all contents requested
more times than a threshold $\widetilde N(\tau)$, where $\tau$ is the content
age. We show that ABT is asymptotically hit rate optimal in the many contents
regime, which allows us to obtain the first characterization of the optimal
performance of a caching system in a dynamic context. We then address small
sample sizes focusing on $L$ local caches and one global cache. On the one hand
we show that the global cache learns L times faster by aggregating all requests
from local caches, which improves hit rates. On the other hand, aggregation
washes out local characteristics of correlated traffic which penalizes hit
rate. This motivates coordination mechanisms which combine global learning of
popularity scores in clusters and LRU with prefetching.

extracts slowly varying features from a multi-dimensional time series. A
supervised extension to SFA for classification and regression is graph-based
SFA (GSFA). GSFA is based on the preservation of similarities, which are
specified by a graph structure derived from the labels. It has been shown that
hierarchical GSFA (HGSFA) allows learning from images and other
high-dimensional data. The feature space spanned by HGSFA is complex due to the
composition of the nonlinearities of the nodes in the network. However, we show
that the network discards useful information prematurely before it reaches
higher nodes, resulting in suboptimal global slowness and an under-exploited
feature space.

information-preserving GSFA (HiGSFA), where information preservation
complements the slowness-maximization goal. We build a 10-layer HiGSFA network

achieving a mean absolute error of 3.50 years, improving the state-of-the-art
performance. HiGSFA and HGSFA support multiple-labels and offer a rich feature

slowness, estimation accuracy and input reconstruction, giving rise to a

Trieste Volume 47 (2015), 1{13",,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this note we present a notion of fundamental scheme for Cohen- Macaulay,
order 1, irreducible congruences of lines. We show that such a congruence is
formed by the k-secant lines to its fundamental scheme for a number k that we
call the secant index of the congruence. If the fundamental scheme X is a
smooth connected variety in PN, then k = (N-1)/(c-1) (where c is the
codimension of X) and X comes equipped with a special tangency divisor cut out
by a virtual hypersurface of degree k-2 (to be precise, linearly equivalent to
a section by an hypersurface of degree (k-2) without being cut by one). This is
explained in the main theorem of this paper. This theorem is followed by a
complete classification of known locally Cohen-Macaulay order 1 congruences of
lines with smooth fundamental scheme. To conclude we remark that according to
Zak's classification of Severi Varieties and Harthsorne conjecture for low
codimension varieties, this classification is complete.

this rate in the framework of dynamical analysis. The dynamical analysis hints
the presence of a non-singular universe (without the big bang singularity) with
two successive accelerated phases, one at the very early phase of the universe

describing this scenario of the universe. To match with our early physics

important to understand the allegiances, communities and structure of key

is to exploit the rich relational data in digital social networks (the social
graph). As social media data sets are very large, most approaches make use of
distributed computing systems for this purpose. Distributing graph processing
requires solving many difficult engineering problems, which has lead some
researchers to look at single-machine solutions that are faster and easier to
maintain. In this article, we present a single-machine real-time system for
large-scale graph processing that allows analysts to interactively explore
graph structures. The key idea is that the aggregate actions of large numbers
of users can be compressed into a data structure that encapsulates user
similarities while being robust to noise and queryable in real-time. We achieve
single machine real-time performance by compressing the neighbourhood of each
vertex using minhash signatures and facilitate rapid queries through Locality
Sensitive Hashing. These techniques reduce query times from hours using
industrial desktop machines operating on the full graph to milliseconds on
standard laptops. Our method allows exploration of strongly associated regions
(i.e. communities) of large graphs in real-time on a laptop. It has been
deployed in software that is actively used by social network analysts and
offers another channel for media owners to monetise their data, helping them to
continue to provide free services that are valued by billions of people

of paramount importance for the characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres.
To date, the totality of exoplanetary observations in the mid- and
far-infrared, at wavelengths $>$3 $\mu$m, have been taken with Spitzer. In some
cases, in the past years, repeated observations and multiple reanalyses of the
same datasets led to discrepant results, raising questions about the accuracy
and reproducibility of such measurements. Morello et al. 2014, 2015 proposed a
blind-source separation method based on the Independent Component Analysis of
pixel time series (pixel-ICA) to analyze IRAC data, obtaining coherent results
when applied to repeated transit observations previously debated in the
literature. Here we introduce a variant to pixel-ICA through the use of wavelet
transform, wavelet pixel-ICA, which extends its applicability to low-S/N cases.
We describe the method and discuss the results obtained over twelve eclipses of
the exoplanet XO3b observed during the ""Warm Spitzer"" era in the 4.5 $\mu$m
band. The final results will be reported also in Ingalls et al. (in prep.),
together with results obtained with other detrending methods, and over ten
synthetic eclipses that were analyzed for the ""IRAC Data Challenge 2015"". Our
results are consistent within 1 $\sigma$ with the ones reported in Wong et al.
2014. The self-consistency of individual measurements of eclipse depth and
phase curve slope over a span of more than three years proves the stability of
Warm Spitzer/IRAC photometry within the error bars, at the level of 1 part in
10$^4$ in stellar flux.

However, experiments have so far been limited to generating only a few squeezed

single-mode squeezing in Laguerre-Gauss and Bessel-Gauss modes, as well as an
arbitrary intensity pattern, all from a single setup using a spatial light
modulator (SLM). The degree of squeezing obtained is limited mainly by the
initial squeezing and diffractive losses introduced by the SLM, while no excess
noise from the SLM is detectable at the measured sideband. The experiment
illustrates the single-mode concept in quantum optics and demonstrates the
viability of current SLMs as flexible tools for the spatial reshaping of
squeezed light.

NN}}=2.76$ TeV using the two component Monte-Carlo Glauber model with shadowing
of the nucleons in the interior by the leading ones. The model parameters are
fixed by comparing to the multiplicity data of p+Pb and Pb+Pb at $\sqrt{s_{\rm
NN}}=5.02$ and $2.76$ TeV respectively. We then compute the centrality
dependence of the eccentricities upto the fourth order as well as their event
by event distributions. The inclusion of shadowing brings the Monte-Carlo
Glauber model predictions in agreement with data as well as with results from
other dynamical models of initial conditions based on gluon saturation at high
energy nuclear collisions. Further, we find that the shadowed Glauber model
provides the desired relative magnitude between the ellipticity and
triangularity of the initial energy distribution required to explain the data
on the even and odd flow harmonics $v_2$ and $v_3$ respectively at the LHC.

  E",,"10.1142/S0218301316300010",,"hep-ph nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this review we give a perspective of the theoretical work done recently on
the interpretation of results from $B$, $D$, $\Lambda_b$, $\Lambda_c$ weak
decays into final states that contain interacting hadrons, and how it is
possible to obtain additional valuable information that is increasing our
understanding of hadron interactions and the nature of many hadronic
resonances. The novelty of these processes is that one begins with a clean
picture at the quark level which allows one to select the basic mechanisms by
means of which the process proceeds. Finally, one has a final state described
in terms of quarks. To make contact with the experiments, where mesons and
baryons are observed, one must hadronize, creating pairs of $q \bar q$ and
writing the new states in terms of mesons and baryons. This concludes the
primary hadron production in these processes. After that, the interaction of
these hadrons takes place, offering a rich spectrum of resonances and special
features from where it is possible to learn much about the interaction of these
hadrons and the nature of many resonances in terms of the components of their
wave functions.

models. The first is the type III 2HDM, and the second is a 2HDM, originally
proposed by Branco et al., in which all flavor-changing neutral processes are
given by the weak mixing matrix. In the latter model, since mixing between the

we show that the Chang's improvement of the energy shaping method is precisely

common feature of these problems is high dimensions. We present here a survey
on classical methods developed in multivariate approximation theory, which are
known to work very well for moderate dimensions and which have potential for
applications in really high dimensions. The theory of hyperbolic cross
approximation and related theory of functions with mixed smoothness are under
detailed study for more than 50 years. It is now well understood that this
theory is important both for theoretical study and for practical applications.
It is also understood that both theoretical analysis and construction of
practical algorithms are very difficult problems. This explains why many
fundamental problems in this area are still unsolved. Only a few survey papers
and monographs on the topic are published. This and recently discovered deep
connections between the hyperbolic cross approximation (and related sparse
grids) and other areas of mathematics such as probability, discrepancy, and
numerical integration motivated us to write this survey. We try to put emphases
on the development of ideas and methods rather than list all the known results
in the area. We formulate many problems, which, to our knowledge, are open

In this model each actor
holds a position on some issue, actors and their opinions being associated to
vertices of the graph, and, additionally, the actors hold opinions of one
another, with these opinions being associated to edges in the graph. These
quantities are allowed to evolve according to the gradient flow of a natural
free energy. We show that for a small spread in opinions the model converges to
a consensus state, where all actors hold the same position. For a larger spread
in opinion there is a phase transition marked by the birth of a second stable
state: in addition to the consensus state there is a second polarized or
partisan state. This state, when it exists, is conjectured to be global energy
minimizer, with the consensus state being a local energy minimizer. We derive
an energy inequality which supports this. Interestingly, all of the steady
states we find, with the exception of the consensus state, are either balanced
(in the sense of Heider) or are completely unbalanced states where all
triangles are unbalanced. The latter solutions are, not surprisingly, always

evolution of quantum coherence and entanglement has been observed in presence
of the above mentioned interactions. We show that the global part of the

of coherence and entanglement decay. For an appropriately defined limiting
case, both coherence and entanglement show freezing behaviour for the high

not only stabilizes the non-classical correlations, but also enhances them for
a finite period. For the memory dependent case, we have seen that the global
interaction enhances the back-flow of information from environment to the

have studied the generation of Quantum Fisher information by the mentioned
process. An intuitive measure of non-classicality based on non-commutativity of
