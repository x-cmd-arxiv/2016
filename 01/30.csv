programming problems in real Hilbert spaces, where the numerator is a proper,
convex and lower semicontinuous function and the denominator is a smooth
function, either concave or convex. In the iterative schemes, we perform a
proximal step with respect to the nonsmooth numerator and a gradient step with
respect to the smooth denominator. The algorithm in case of a concave
denominator has the particularity that it generates sequences which approach
both the (global) optimal solutions set and the optimal objective value of the
underlying fractional programming problem. In case of a convex denominator the
numerical scheme approaches the set of critical points of the objective
function, provided the latter satisfies the Kurdyka-\L{}ojasiewicz property.

parameter space of the encounters, varying the mass ratio of the two stars,
their pericentre and eccentricity of the encounter, and its geometry. We find
that particles are transferred to the other star from a restricted radial range
in the disc and the limiting radii of this transfer region depend on the
parameters of the encounter. We derive an approximate analytic description of
the inner radius of the region. The efficiency of the mass transfer generally
decreases with increasing encounter pericentre and increasing mass of the star
initially possessing the disc. Depending on the parameters of the encounter,
the transfer particles have a specific distributions in the space of orbital
elements (semimajor axis, eccentricity, inclination, and argument of
pericentre) around their new host star. The population of the transferred
particles can be used to constrain the encounter through which it was
delivered. We expect that many stars experienced transfer among their debris
discs and planetary systems in their birth environment. This mechanism presents
a formation channel for objects on wide orbits of arbitrary inclinations,
typically having high eccentricity but possibly also close-to-circular
(eccentricities of about 0.1). Depending on the geometry, such orbital elements
can be distinct from those of the objects formed around the star.

scales super-linearly with the number of unknowns and, therefore, prohibits the
application to high polynomial degrees. This paper proposes a novel
factorization technique, which yields a linear operation count of just 13N
multiplications, where N is the total number of unknowns. In comparison to
previous work it saves a factor larger than 3 and clearly outpaces unfactored
variants for all polynomial degrees. Using the new technique as a building

scaling linearly with N for polynomial degrees $2 \leq p \leq 32$ . Moreover
the solver proved remarkably robust for aspect ratios up to 128.

negligible eccentricities. Here, we report on the first unambiguous
identification of a LMWD in an eccentric (e=0.13) orbit with a millisecond

8600 +/- 190 K) and 3D systemic velocity (179.5 km\s). We also place
model-independent constraints on the WD radius (R_WD = 0.024+/- 0.004/0.002
R_sun) and surface gravity (log g = 7.11 +/- 0.08/0.16 dex). The WD and
kinematic properties are consistent with the expectations for low-mass X-ray
binary evolution and disfavour a three-body formation channel. In the case of
the high eccentricity being the result of a spontaneous phase transition, we
infer a mass of 1.6 M_sun for the progenitor of the pulsar, which is too low
for the quark-nova mechanism proposed by Jiang et al. (2015). Similarly, the
scenario of Freire & Tauris (2014), in which a WD collapses onto a neutron star
via an rotationally-delayed accretion-induced collapse, requires both a
high-mass differentially rotating progenitor and a significant momentum kick at
birth under our constraints. Contrarily, we find that eccentricity pumping via
interaction with a transient circumbinary disk is consistent with all inferred
properties. Finally, we report tentative evidence for pulsations which, if
confirmed, would transform the star into an unprecedented laboratory for WD
physics and stellar convection.

The {\gamma}-CP has a distorted hexagonal network and exhibits a semi-metallic

monolayer to be yet unexplored 2D materials holding great promises for
applications in high-performance electronics and optoelectronics.

stars. The issue is often addressed by allowing for a meridional circulation,
but this is not devoid of theoretical complications. Models of rotation in the
Sun which maintain strict radiative equilibrium, making use of the observation
that the Sun is not in a state of barotropic rotation, have recently been
suggested. To investigate the dynamical behaviour of these solutions, we study
the local stability of stratified, weakly magnetized, differentially rotating
fluids to non-axisymmetric perturbations. Finite heat conductivity, kinematic
viscosity, and resistivity are present. The evolution of local embedded
perturbations is governed by a set of coupled, ordinary differential equations
with time-dependent coefficients. Two baroclinic models of rotation for the
upper radiative zone and tachocline are studied: (i) an interpolation based on
helioseismology data, (ii) a theoretical solution directly compatible with
radiative equilibrium. The growth of the local Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke
instability appears to be suppressed, largely because of the viscosity. An
extensive exploration of wavenumber space is carried out, with and without a
magnetic field. Although we easily find classical local instabilities when they
ought formally to be present, for the Sun the analysis reveals neither unstable
solutions, nor even solutions featuring a large transient growth. We have not
ruled out larger scale or nonlinear instabilities, nor have we rigorously
proven local stability. But rotational configurations in close agreement with
observations, generally thought to be vulnerable to the classic local
Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability, do appear to be locally stable under
rather general circumstances.

algorithm based on a Poisson noise model that can account for photon-limited

image quality, previous approaches use edge-preserving regularizers to promote
piecewise constancy of the image in the spatial domain while treating each
spectral bin separately. Instead, we propose spectrally grouped regularization
that promotes piecewise constant images along the spatial directions but also
ensures that the MTPs of neighboring spatial bins are similar, if they contain
the same material. We demonstrate that this group regularization results in
improvement of both spectral and spatial image quality. We pursue an
optimization transfer approach where convex decompositions are used to lift the
problem such that all hyper-voxels can be updated in parallel and in
closed-form. The group penalty introduces a challenge since it is not directly
amendable to these decompositions. We use the alternating directions method of
multipliers (ADMM) to replace the original problem with an equivalent sequence
of sub-problems that are amendable to convex decompositions, leading to a
highly parallel algorithm. We demonstrate the performance on real data.

spaces of any dimension in terms of forward-directed null displacements. The
evolution is described entirely in terms of discrete hops which do not require
a continuum spacetime. Moreover, the evolution rule is purely algebraic, so it
can be defined not only on ordinary real de Sitter and anti-de Sitter, but also
on the rational points of the quadratic equations that define these spaces. For
three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, a simpler evolution rule is possible
that descends from the Wess-Zumino-Witten equations of motion. In this case,
one may replace three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space by a non-compact
discrete subgroup of SL(2,R) whose structure is related to the Pell equation. A
discrete version of the BTZ black hole can be constructed as a quotient of this
subgroup. This discrete black hole avoids the firewall paradox by a curious
mechanism: even for large black holes, there are no points inside the horizon

perceptions of grading is instrumental for curriculum developers as well as
professional development leaders interested in improving grading practices. In
order to identify TAs' perceptions of grading, we used a data collection tool
designed to elicit TAs' considerations when making grading decisions as well as
elicit possible conflicts between their stated goals and actual grading
practices. The tool was designed to explicate TAs' attitudes towards
research-based grading practices that promote effective problem solving
approaches. TAs were first asked to state their goals for grading in general.
Then, TAs graded student solutions in a simulated setting while explicating and
discussing their underlying considerations. The data collection tool was
administered at the beginning of TAs' first postgraduate teaching appointment
and again after one semester of teaching experience. We found that almost all
of the TAs stated that the purpose of grading was formative, i.e., grading
should encourage students to learn from their mistakes as well as inform the
instructor of common student difficulties. However, when making grading
decisions in a simulated setting, the majority of TAs' grading considerations
focused on correctness and they did not assign grades in a way that encourages
use of effective problem solving approaches. TAs' perceptions of grading did
not change significantly during one semester of teaching experience.

group manifold $G^{\times d}$, which represent a non-local generalization of
standard QFT, and a candidate formalism for quantum gravity, since, when
endowed with appropriate data, they can be interpreted as defining a field
theoretic description of the fundamental building blocks of quantum spacetime.
Their renormalisation analysis is crucial both for establishing their
consistency as quantum field theories, and for studying the emergence of
continuum spacetime and geometry from them. In this paper, we study the
renormalisation group flow of two simple classes of TGFTs, defined for the
group $G=\mathbb{R}$ for arbitrary rank, both without and with gauge invariance
conditions, by means of functional renormalisation group techniques. The issue
of IR divergences is tackled by the definition of a proper thermodynamic limit
for TGFTs. We map the phase diagram of such models, in a simple truncation, and
identify both UV and IR fixed points of the RG flow. Encouragingly, for all the

the coexistence of two degenerate isolated skyrmions characterized by mutually

governed by the N=4 super Yang-Mills theory resembles the quark-gluon plasma
studied experimentally in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The analysis is
done in a weak coupling regime where perturbative methods are applicable. Since
the Keldysh-Schwinger approach is used, not only equilibrium but also
nonequilibrium plasmas, which are assumed to be ultrarelativistic, are under
consideration. First, using the functional techniques we introduce
Faddeev-Popov ghosts into the Keldysh-Schwinger formalism of nonAbelian gauge
theories. Next the collective excitations of the N=1 SUSY QED plasma are
considered and compared to those of the usual QED system. The analysis is
repeated to confront with each other the plasmas governed by the N=4 super
Yang-Mills and QCD theories. Finally, transport properties of the systems are
also discussed. Since both collective excitations and transport characteristics
of supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric plasmas are very similar to each other
we conclude that supersymmetric plasma systems are qualitatively the same as
their nonsupersymmetric partners in weak coupling regime. The quantitative
differences mostly reflect different numbers of degrees of freedom.

the intensities of the two strong lines R_2 and N_2 (or S_2 and N_2 for oxygen)
only. The corresponding two-dimensional relations are provided. There are
considerable advantages of the suggested calibration relations as compared to
the existing ones. First, the oxygen and nitrogen abundances estimated through
the suggested calibrations agree with the Te-based abundances within ~0.1 dex
over the whole metallicity range, i.e., the relative accuracy of the
calibration-based abundances is 0.1 dex. Although we constructed distinct
relations for high- and low-metallicity objects, the separation between these
two can be simply obtained from the intensity of the N_2 line. Moreover, the
applicability ranges of the high- and low-metallicity relations overlap for
adjacent metallicities, i.e., the transition zone disappears. Second, the
oxygen abundances produced by the two suggested calibrations are in remarkable
agreement with each other. In fact, the R-based and S-based oxygen abundances
agree within ~0.05 dex in the majority of cases for more than three thousand

realizations of networks that obey a given set of constraints, usually in form

simple graphs with given degree sequence or also with given degree correlations
expressed in the form of a joint degree matrix. One approach is to use Markov
chains based on edge switches (swaps) that preserve the constraints, are
irreducible (ergodic) and fast mixing. In 1999, Kannan, Tetali and Vempala
(KTV) proposed a simple swap Markov chain for sampling graphs with given degree
sequence and conjectured that it mixes rapidly (in poly-time) for arbitrary
degree sequences. While the conjecture is still open, it was proven for special
degree sequences, in particular, for those of undirected and directed regular
simple graphs, of half-regular bipartite graphs, and of graphs with certain
bounded maximum degrees. Here we prove the fast mixing KTV conjecture for
novel, exponentially large classes of irregular degree sequences. Our method is
based on a canonical decomposition of degree sequences into split graph degree
sequences, a structural theorem for the space of graph realizations and on a
factorization theorem for Markov chains. After introducing bipartite splitted
degree sequences, we also generalize the canonical split graph decomposition

of stellar and HI mass are similar to those of the galaxies in these field

field for a given total HI mass. In the global star formation picture presented

examples of such finite-dimensional algebras that are not the 'usual'
nil-Coxeter algebras: a novel 2-parameter type $A$ family that we call
$NC_A(n,d)$. We explore several combinatorial properties of $NC_A(n,d)$,
including its Coxeter word basis, length function, and Hilbert-Poincare series,
and show that the corresponding generalized Coxeter group is not a flat
deformation of $NC_A(n,d)$. These algebras yield symmetric semigroup module
categories that are necessarily not monoidal; we write down their Tannaka-Krein
duality.
  Further motivated by the Broue-Malle-Rouquier (BMR) freeness conjecture [J.
reine angew. math. 1998], we define generalized nil-Coxeter algebras over all
discrete real or complex reflection groups $W$, finite or infinite. We provide
a complete classification of all such algebras that are finite-dimensional.
Remarkably, these turn out to be either the usual nil-Coxeter algebras, or the
algebras $NC_A(n,d)$. This proves as a special case - and strengthens - the
lack of equidimensional nil-Coxeter analogues for finite complex reflection
groups. In particular, generic Hecke algebras are not flat deformations of
$NC_W$ for $W$ complex.

achieving the extremely high dynamic range required to differentiate the
planetary signal from the star can be overcome to a sufficient degree. Fully
utilizing the potential of ELTs for exoplanet imaging will likely require
simultaneous and self-consistent determination of both the planetary image and
the unknown aberrations in multiple planes of the optical system, using
statistical inference based on the wavefront sensor and science camera data
streams. This approach promises to overcome the most important systematic
errors inherent in the various schemes based on differential imaging, such as
ADI and SDI. This paper is the first in a series on this subject, in which a
formalism is established for the exoplanet imaging problem, setting the stage
for the statistical inference methods to follow in the future. Every effort has
been made to be rigorous and complete, so that validity of approximations to be
made later can be assessed. Here, the polarimetric image is expressed in terms
of aberrations in the various planes of a polarizing telescope with an adaptive
optics system. Further, it is shown that current methods that utilize focal
plane sensing to correct the speckle field, e.g., electric field conjugation,
rely on the tacit assumption that aberrations on multiple optical surfaces can
be represented as aberration on a single optical surface, ultimately limiting
their potential effectiveness for ground-based astronomy.

differing mechanical boundary conditions, i.e., stress-free or no-slip, on the
primary instability in rotating convection becomes asymptotically small in the
limit of rapid rotation. This is accounted for by the diminishing impact of the
viscous stresses exerted within Ekman boundary layers and the associated
vertical momentum transport by Ekman pumping. By contrast, in the nonlinear
regime recent experiments and supporting simulations are now providing evidence
that the efficiency of heat transport remains strongly influenced by Ekman
pumping in the rapidly rotating limit. In this paper, a reduced model is
developed for the case of low Rossby number convection in a plane layer
geometry with no-slip upper and lower boundaries held at fixed temperatures. A
complete description of the dynamics requires the existence of three distinct
regions within the fluid layer: a geostrophically balanced interior where fluid
motions are predominately aligned with the axis of rotation, Ekman boundary
layers immediately adjacent to the bounding plates, and thermal wind layers
driven by Ekman pumping in between. The reduced model uses a classical Ekman
pumping parameterization to alleviate the need for spatially resolving the
Ekman boundary layers. Results are presented for both linear stability theory
and a special class of nonlinear solutions described by a single horizontal
spatial wavenumber. It is shown that Ekman pumping allows for significant
enhancement in the heat transport relative to that observed in simulations with
stress-free boundaries. Without the intermediate thermal wind layer the
nonlinear feedback from Ekman pumping would be able to generate a heat
transport that diverges to infinity. This layer arrests this blowup resulting
in finite heat transport at a significantly enhanced value.

consequence of this and recent results by

observational results has been hindered by the subjective selection of UDGs,
and the limited study of only the Coma (and some examples in the Virgo-)
cluster. We extend the study of UDGs using 8 clusters in the redshift range
0.044<z<0.063 with deep g- and r-band imaging data taken with MegaCam at the
CFHT. We describe an automatic selection pipeline for quantitative
identification, tested for completeness using image simulations of these
galaxies. We find that the abundance of the UDGs we can detect increases with
cluster mass, reaching ~200 in typical haloes of M200~10^15 Msun. The cluster
UDGs have colours consistent with the cluster red sequence, and have a steep
size distribution that declines as n~r_eff^-3.4. Their radial distribution is
significantly steeper than NFW in the outskirts, and is significantly shallower
in the inner parts. They follow the same radial distribution as the more
massive quiescent galaxies in the clusters, except within the core region of
r<0.15XR200 (or <300 kpc). Within this region the number density of UDGs drops
and is consistent with zero. These diffuse galaxies can only resist tidal
forces down to this cluster-centric distance if they are highly centrally
dark-matter dominated. The observation that the radial distribution of more
compact dwarf galaxies (r_eff<1.0 kpc) with similar luminosities follows the
same distribution as the UDGs, but exist down to a smaller distance of 100kpc
from the cluster centres, indicates that they may have similarly massive
sub-haloes as the UDGs. Although several scenarios can give rise to the UDG
population, our results point to differences in the formation history as the
most plausible explanation.

the N-body simulation, leading to a divergent fraction of quenched satellites
in high- and low-resolution simulations. Here, we incorporate an analytic model
to trace the subhaloes below the resolution limit. We demonstrate that we then
obtain better converged results between the Millennium I and II simulations,

M_{halo}=[14,15]$). We also include a new physical model for the ram-pressure
stripping of cold gas in satellite galaxies. However, we find very clear
discrepancies with observed trends in quenched satellite galaxy fractions as a
function of stellar mass at fixed halo mass. At fixed halo mass, the quenched
fraction of satellites does not depend on stellar mass in the models, but
increases strongly with mass in the data. In addition to the over-prediction of
low-mass passive satellites, the models also predict too few quenched central
galaxies with low stellar masses, so the problems in reproducing quenched
fractions are not purely of environmental origin. Further improvements to the
treatment of the gas-physical processes regulating the star formation histories
of galaxies are clearly necessary to resolve these problems.

is observationally challenging. Such measurements require near-infrared spectra
with a continuum detection of at least moderate signal-to-noise, often
necessitating long integrations. In this paper, we present deep X-Shooter
spectroscopy of one of only two known gravitationally-lensed massive quiescent
galaxies at $z>2$. This galaxy is quadruply imaged, with the brightest images
magnified by a factor of $\sim5$. The total exposure time of our data is 9.8
hours on-source; however the magnification, and the slit placement encompassing
2 images, provides a total equivalent exposure time of 215 hours. From this
deep spectrum we measure a redshift ($z_{\mathrm{spec}}=2.756\pm0.001$), making
this one of the highest redshift quiescent galaxies that is spectroscopically
confirmed. We simultaneously fit both the spectroscopic and photometric data to
determine stellar population parameters and conclude this galaxy is relatively
young, intermediate-mass, consistent with low dust content, and has quenched
only relatively recently. This recent quenching is confirmed by strong Balmer
absorption, particularly $H\delta$. Remarkably, this proves that at least some
intermediate-mass galaxies have already quenched as early as $z\sim2.8$.
Additionally, we have measured a velocity dispersion
($\sigma=187\pm43~\mathrm{km/s}$), making this the highest-redshift quiescent
galaxy with a dispersion measurement. We confirm that this galaxy falls on the
same mass fundamental plane (MFP) as galaxies at z=2.2, consistent with little
to no evolution in the MFP up to z=2.8. Overall this galaxy is proof of
existence of intermediate-mass quenched galaxies in the distant universe, and
that lensing is a powerful tool for determining their properties with improved
accuracy.

superposition of Fock states weighted with binomial coefficients. The binomial
codes can exactly correct errors that are polynomial up to a specific degree in
bosonic creation and annihilation operators, including amplitude damping and
displacement noise as well as boson addition and dephasing errors. For
realistic continuous-time dissipative evolution, the codes can perform
approximate quantum error correction to any given order in the timestep between
error detection measurements. We present an explicit approximate quantum error
recovery operation based on projective measurements and unitary operations. The
binomial codes are tailored for detecting boson loss and gain errors by means
of measurements of the generalized number parity. We discuss optimization of
the binomial codes and demonstrate that by relaxing the parity structure, codes
with even lower unrecoverable error rates can be achieved. The binomial codes
are related to existing two-mode bosonic codes but offer the advantage of
requiring only a single bosonic mode to correct amplitude damping as well as
the ability to correct other errors. Our codes are similar in spirit to 'cat
codes' based on superpositions of the coherent states, but offer several
advantages such as smaller mean number, exact rather than approximate
orthonormality of the code words, and an explicit unitary operation for
repumping energy into the bosonic mode. The binomial quantum codes are
realizable with current superconducting circuit technology and they should
prove useful in other quantum technologies, including bosonic quantum memories,
photonic quantum communication, and optical-to-microwave up- and
down-conversion.

their age and mass can be estimated with higher precision than for field stars.
For this reason, OCs are considered an important laboratory to study the
relation between the physical properties of the planets and those of their host
stars, and the evolution of planetary systems. We started an observational
campaign within the GAPS collaboration to search for and characterize planets
in OCs We monitored the Praesepe member Pr0211 to improve the eccentricity of
the Hot-Jupiter (HJ) already known to orbit this star and search for additional
planets. An eccentric orbit for the HJ would support a planet-planet scattering
process after its formation. From 2012 to 2015, we collected 70 radial velocity
(RV) measurements with HARPS-N and 36 with TRES of Pr0211. Simultaneous
photometric observations were carried out with the robotic STELLA telescope in
order to characterize the stellar activity. We discovered a long-term trend in
the RV residuals that we show to be due to the presence of a second, massive,
outer planet. Orbital parameters for the two planets are derived by
simultaneously fitting RVs and photometric light curves, with the activity
signal modelled as a series of sinusoids at the rotational period of the star
and its harmonics. We confirm that Pr0211b has a nearly circular orbit ($e =
0.02 \pm 0.01$), with an improvement of a factor two with respect to the
previous determination of its eccentricity, and estimate that Pr0211c has a
mass $M_p\sin i = 7.9 \pm 0.2 M_J$, a period $P>$3500 days and a very eccentric
orbit ($e>$0.60). Such peculiar systems may be typical of open clusters if the
planet-planet scattering phase leading to the formation of HJs is caused by
stellar encounters rather than unstable primordial orbits. Pr0211 is the first
multi-planet system discovered around an OC star. (abridged)

within P3HT/PCBM/SWNT blended samples P3HT acts as a hole acceptor, narrowing
the PB peak by exciton delocalization, which reveals a PA peak. Our results

Combining our sample with measurements from the literature, we present oxygen
abundances of 119 host HII regions, by extracting emission line fluxes and
using abundance diagnostics. Then, following Dessart et al., these abundances
are compared to equivalent widths of Fe 5018 A at various time and colour
epochs. Our distribution of inferred SNII host HII-region abundances has a
range of ~0.6 dex. We confirm the dearth of SNeII exploding at metallicities
lower than those found (on average) in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The
equivalent width of Fe 5018 A at 50 days post explosion shows a statistically
significant correlation with host HII-region oxygen abundance. The strength of
this correlation increases if one excludes abundance measurements derived far
from SN explosion sites. The correlation significance also increases if we only
analyse a 'gold' IIP sample, and if a colour epoch is used in place of time. In
addition, no evidence is found of correlation between progenitor metallicity
and SN light-curve or spectral properties - except for that stated above with
respect to Fe 5018 A equivalent width - suggesting progenitor metallicity is
not a driving factor in producing the diversity observed in our sample. This
study provides observational evidence of the usefulness of SNII as metallicity
indicators. We finish with a discussion of the methodology needed to use SN
spectra as independent metallicity diagnostics throughout the Universe.

yet unexplored $-14 < M_{g} < -8$ magnitude range. The observed distribution of
apparent axis ratios is then fit by families of triaxial models with
normally-distributed intrinsic ellipticities and triaxialities. We develop a
Bayesian framework to explore the posterior distribution of the model
parameters, which allows us to work directly on discrete data, and to account
for individual, surface brightness-dependent axis ratio uncertainties. For this
population we infer a mean intrinsic ellipticity E=0.43, and a mean triaxiality
T=0.16. This implies that faint Virgo galaxies are best described as a family
of thick, nearly oblate spheroids with mean intrinsic axis ratios 1:0.94:0.57.
We additionally attempt a study of the intrinsic shapes of Local Group
satellites of similar luminosities. For the LG population we infer a slightly
larger mean intrinsic ellipticity E=0.51, and the paucity of objects with round
apparent shapes translates into more triaxial mean shapes, 1:0.76:0.49. We
finally compare the intrinsic shapes of NGVS low-mass galaxies with samples of
more massive quiescent systems, and with field, star-forming galaxies of
similar luminosities. We find that the intrinsic flattening in this
low-luminosity regime is almost independent of the environment in which the
galaxy resides--but there is a hint that objects may be slightly rounder in
denser environments. The comparable flattening distributions of low-luminosity
galaxies that have experienced very different degrees of environmental effects
suggests that internal processes are the main drivers of galaxy structure at
low masses--with external mechanisms playing a secondary role.

occurrence in trauma patients, with potentially devastating consequences.
Computer-aided detection (CADe) could assist in the detection and
classification of spine fractures. Furthermore, CAD could help assess the
stability and chronicity of fractures, as well as facilitate research into
optimization of treatment paradigms.
  In this work, we apply deep convolutional networks (ConvNets) for the
automated detection of posterior element fractures of the spine. First, the
vertebra bodies of the spine with its posterior elements are segmented in spine
CT using multi-atlas label fusion. Then, edge maps of the posterior elements
are computed. These edge maps serve as candidate regions for predicting a set
of probabilities for fractures along the image edges using ConvNets in a 2.5D
fashion (three orthogonal patches in axial, coronal and sagittal planes). We
explore three different methods for training the ConvNet using 2.5D patches
along the edge maps of 'positive', i.e. fractured posterior-elements and
'negative', i.e. non-fractured elements.
  An experienced radiologist retrospectively marked the location of 55
displaced posterior-element fractures in 18 trauma patients. We randomly split
the data into training and testing cases. In testing, we achieve an
area-under-the-curve of 0.857. This corresponds to 71% or 81% sensitivities at
5 or 10 false-positives per patient, respectively. Analysis of our set of
trauma patients demonstrates the feasibility of detecting posterior-element
fractures in spine CT images using computer vision techniques such as deep
convolutional networks.

general relativistic ray tracing simulations. Reverberation lags between
correlated variability in the directly observed continuum emission and that
reflected from the accretion disc arise due to the additional light travel time
between the corona and reflecting disc. X-ray reverberation is detected from an
increasing sample of Seyfert galaxies and a number of common properties are
observed, including a transition from the characteristic reverberation
signature at high frequencies to a hard lag within the continuum component at
low frequencies, as well a pronounced dip in the reverberation lag at 3keV.
These features are not trivially explained by the reverberation of X-rays
originating from simple point sources. We therefore model reverberation from
coronae extended both over the surface of the disc and vertically. Causal
propagation through its extent for both the simple case of constant velocity
propagation and propagation linked to the viscous timescale in the underlying
accretion disc is included as well as stochastic variability arising due to
turbulence locally on the disc. We find that the observed features of X-ray
reverberation in Seyfert galaxies can be explained if the long timescale
variability is dominated by the viscous propagation of fluctuations through the
corona. The corona extends radially at low height over the surface of the disc
but with a bright central region in which fluctuations propagate up the black
hole rotation axis driven by more rapid variability arising from the innermost
regions of the accretion flow.

edges of a bilayer symmetric GaAs structure in contrast to no effect in a
single-layer configuration. The intrinsic mechanism of the spin-orbit
interaction we consider arises from the coupling between two subband states of
opposite parities. We obtain a parametrically large magnitude of the edge spin
density for the two-subband sample as compared to the usual single-subband
structure. We show that the presence of a gap in the system, i.e., the energy
separation $\Delta$ between the two subband bottoms, changes drastically the
picture of the edge spin accumulation. Thus one can easily proceed from the
regime of weak spin accumulation to the regime of strong one by varying the
Fermi energy (electron density) and/or $\Delta$. We estimate that by changing
the gap $\Delta$ from zero up to $1\div 2$ K, the magnitude of the effect
changes by three orders of magnitude. This opens up the possibility for the
design of new spintronic devices.

weight systems. These are functions on chord diagrams satisfying so-called
4-term relations. In the study of the sl2 weight system, it was shown that its
value on a chord diagram depends on the intersection graph of the diagram
rather than on the diagram itself. Moreover, it was shown that the value of
this weight system on an intersection graph depends on the cy- cle matroid of
the graph rather than on the graph itself. This result arose the question
whether there is a natural way to introduce a 4-term relation on the space
spanned by matroids, similar to the one for graphs. It happened however that
the answer is negative: there are graphs having isomorphic cycle matroids such
that applying the ""second Vassiliev move"" to a pair of corresponding vertices
a;b of the graphs we obtain two graphs with nonisomorphic matroids.
  The goal of the present paper is to show that the situation is different for
binary delta-matroids: one can define both the first and the second Vassiliev
moves for binary delta-matroids and introduce a 4-term relation for them in
such a way that the mapping taking a chord diagram to its delta-matroid
respects the corresponding 4-term relations. Moreover, this mapping admits a
natural extension to chord diagrams on several circles, which correspond to
singular links. Delta-matroids were introduced by A. Bouchet for the purpose of
studying embedded graphs, whence their relationship with (multiloop) chord
diagrams is by no means unexpected. Some evidence for the existence of such a
relationship can be found, for example, the Tutte polynomial for embedded
graphs has been introduced. It was shown that this polynomial depends on the
delta-matroid of the embedded graph rather than the graph itself and satises
the Vassilev 4-term relation.

It usually also finds aggregated scores, which correspond to the target

where efficient relationship queries are needed. However, row stores, column

briefly comment on the straightforward extension of relationship queries that
allows accessing arbitrary schemas.
  The GQ-Fast in-memory analytics engine utilizes a bottom-up fully pipelined
query execution model running on a novel data organization that combines
salient features of column-based organization, indexing and compression.
Furthermore, GQ-Fast compiles its query plans into executable C++ source codes.
Besides achieving runtime efficiency, GQ-Fast also reduces main memory
requirements because, unlike column databases, GQ-Fast selectively allows more
dense forms of compression including heavy-weighted compressions, which do not

  We used GQ-Fast to accelerate queries for two OLAP dashboards in the

basis sets for use in electronic structure and quantum Monte Carlo

atom is singled out from its environment, while the entire system (atom and
environment) is described by a Slater determinant or its antisymmetrized
geminal power (AGP) extension. The embedding procedure described here allows
for the systematic and consistent contraction of the primitive basis set into
geminal embedded orbitals (GEOs), with a dramatic reduction of the number of
variational parameters necessary to represent the many-body wave function, for
a chosen target accuracy. Within the variational Monte Carlo method, the Slater
or AGP part is determined by a variational minimization of the energy of the
whole system in presence of a flexible and accurate Jastrow factor,
representing most of the dynamical electronic correlation. The resulting GEO
basis set opens the way for a fully controlled optimization of many-body wave
functions in electronic structure calculation of bulk materials, namely,
containing a large number of electrons and atoms. We present applications on
the water molecule, the volume collapse transition in cerium, and the

from the weighted average to the optimal solution and showing that the weighted

this is achieved by analyzing the distance change from the agents' estimates to

could have been in solid form, implying a low-mass atmosphere. We investigate
how the obliquity would have varied for a hypothetical rapidly rotating Early
Venus. The obliquity variation structure of an ensemble of hypothetical Early
Venuses is simpler than that Earth would have if it lacked its large Moon
(Lissauer et al., 2012), having just one primary chaotic regime at high
prograde obliquities. We note an unexpected long-term variability of up to
$\pm7^\circ$ for retrograde Venuses. Low-obliquity Venuses show very low total
obliquity variability over billion-year timescales -- comparable to that of the
real Moon-influenced Earth.

We derive the magnesium isotopic ratios for all stars and find no significant

differences in the spread in the Mg isotopes in either population. No trends

that in the three conditions defining Devaney chaos, topological transitivity
and dense periodic points together imply sensitive dependence on initial
condition(Banks, Brooks, Cairns, Davis and Stacey, 1992). In this paper, the
result of Banks et al. is generalized to a class of the non-autonomous
dynamical systems (NADS) $(X,f_{1,\infty})$. Also, by the studying of NADS over
their iterated systems $(X,f_{1,\infty}^{[k]})$, we know that for two sensitive
NADS, the one which preserve sensitive in its any times iterated systems is
more sensitive than the one not. In this case, several sufficient conditions
ensuring two kinds of sensitivities are preserved under the arbitrary number of
iterations of certain NADS are given.

MHD equations without neglecting any physical term. Different MHD solutions
were generated for different values of (a) the disk aspect ratio
($\varepsilon$) and (b) the ejection efficiency ($p$). We generated two kinds
of MHD solutions depending on the absence (cold solution) or presence (warm
solution) of heating at the disk surface. The cold MHD solutions are found to
be inadequate to account for winds due to their low ejection efficiency. The
warm solutions can have sufficiently high values of $p (\gtrsim 0.1)$ which is
required to explain the observed physical quantities in the wind. The heating
(required at the disk surface for the warm solutions) could be due to the
illumination which would be more efficient in the Soft state. We found that in
the Hard state a range of ionisation parameter is thermodynamically unstable,
which makes it impossible to have any wind at all, in the Hard state. Our
results would suggest that a thermo-magnetic process is required to explain

contribution of this paper is a precise mathematical definition of the
""extended support"" (associated to the noise-free image) of TV denoising. It is
intuitively the region which is unstable and will suffer from the staircasing
effect. We highlight in several practical cases, such as the indicator of
convex sets, that this region can be determined explicitly. Our second and main
contribution is a proof that the TV denoising method indeed restores an image
which is exactly constant outside a small tube surrounding the extended
support. The radius of this tube shrinks toward zero as the noise level
vanishes, and are able to determine, in some cases, an upper bound on the
convergence rate. For indicators of so-called ""calibrable"" sets (such as disks
or properly eroded squares), this extended support matches the edges, so that
discontinuities produced by TV denoising cluster tightly around the edges. In
contrast, for indicators of more general shapes or for complicated images, this
extended support can be larger. Beside these main results, our paper also
proves several intermediate results about fine properties of TV regularization,
in particular for indicators of calibrable and convex sets, which are of
independent interest.

$0<n<1$, the diagram has the same topology as the generic O($n$) phase diagram

a line of phase transitions for $n\le 1$. The line ends at $n=1$ in an

produce something useful over time. Dematerialization fundamentally derives
from ongoing increases in technical performance but it can be counteracted by
demand rebound - increases in usage because of increased value (or decreased
cost) that also results from increasing technical performance. A major question
then is to what extent technological performance improvement can offset and is
offsetting continuously increasing economic consumption. This paper contributes
to answering this question by offering some simple quantitative extensions to
the theory of dematerialization. The paper then empirically examines the
materials consumption trends as well as cost trends for a large set of
materials and a few modern artifacts over the past decades. In each of 57 cases
examined, the particular combinations of demand elasticity and technical
performance rate improvement are not consistent with dematerialization.
Overall, the theory extension and empirical examination indicate that there is
no dematerialization occurring even for cases of information technology with

unfettered technological change is not supported by our results.

(typically affecting different genes) in which the co-occurrence of the events
results in cell or organismal lethality, but the cell or organism remains
viable when only one of the events occurs. Synthetic lethality has gained
attention in the last few years for its value in selective killing of cancer
cells: by targeting the synthetic lethal partner of an altered gene in cancer,
only the cancer cells can be killed while sparing normal cells. In a recent
study, we showed that mutual exclusive combinations of genetic events in cancer
hint at naturally occurring synthetic lethal combinations, and therefore by
systematically mining for these combinations we can identify novel therapeutic
targets for cancer. Based on this, we had identified a list of 718 genes that
are mutually exclusive to six DNA-damage response genes in cancer. Here, we
extend these results to identify a subset of 43 genes whose over-expression
correlates with significantly poor survival in estrogen receptor-negative
breast cancers, and thus provide a promising list of potential therapeutic
targets and/or biomarkers.

  Process","Full version for the paper appeared in INFOCOM'16 with the same title",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Efficient virtual machine (VM) management can dramatically reduce energy
consumption in data centers. Existing VM management algorithms fall into two
categories based on whether the VMs' resource demands are assumed to be static
or dynamic. The former category fails to maximize the resource utilization as
they cannot adapt to the dynamic nature of VMs' resource demands. Most
approaches in the latter category are heuristical and lack theoretical
performance guarantees. In this work, we formulate dynamic VM management as a
large-scale Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and derive an optimal
solution. Our analysis of real-world data traces supports our choice of the
modeling approach. However, solving the large-scale MDP problem suffers from
the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, we further exploit the special
structure of the problem and propose an approximate MDP-based dynamic VM
management method, called MadVM. We prove the convergence of MadVM and analyze
the bound of its approximation error. Moreover, MadVM can be implemented in a
distributed system, which should suit the needs of real data centers. Extensive
simulations based on two real-world workload traces show that MadVM achieves
significant performance gains over two existing baseline approaches in power
consumption, resource shortage and the number of VM migrations. Specifically,
the more intensely the resource demands fluctuate, the more MadVM outperforms.

Corteel and Kim defined the sign of a permutation tableau in terms of the

have btained a formula for the sign-imbalance of permutation tableaux of length
$n$ by using generating functions and asked for a combinatorial proof.
Moreover, they raised the question of finding a sign-imbalance formula for type
$B$ permutation tableaux introduced by Lam and Williams. We define a statistic
$\nwnm$ over permutations and show that the number of unrestricted columns over
permutation tableaux of length $n$ is equally distributed with $\nwnm$ over

sign of a type $B$ permutation tableau in term of the number of certain rows
and columns. On the other hand, we construct a bijection between the type $B$

and we show that the statistic $\nwnm$ over symmetric permutations of length

that in many realistic situations, e.g. relativistic heavy-ion collisions, both

the momentum anisotropy parameter $\xi$ and the angle ($\theta_n$) between the
propagation vector and the anisotropy direction. It has maximum growth rate at
$\theta_n=0$ while $\theta_n=\pi/2$ corresponds to a damping. On the other hand
the pure chiral-imbalance instability occurs in an isotropic plasma and depends
on difference between the chiral chemical potentials of right and left-handed
particles. It is shown that when $\theta_n=0$, only for a very small values of
the anisotropic parameter $\xi\sim \xi_c$, growth rates of the both
instabilities are comparable. For the cases $\xi_c<\xi\ll1$, $\xi\approx 1$ or
$\xi \geq 1$ at $\theta_n=0$, the Weibel modes dominate over the
chiral-imbalance instability if $\mu_5/T\leq1$. However, when $\mu_5/T\geq1$,
it is possible to have dominance of the chiral-imbalance modes at certain

The behavior of dark energy's equation of state parameter indicates that it is

By analysing the evolution of the deviations of state parameter and the total
pressure of the universe, we find that for an anisotropic Bianchi type I
universe, it transits from a high anisotropy stage to a more homogeneous stage
in the near past. Using the normal entropy given by Gibbs' law of
thermodynamics, it is proved that the generalized second law of thermodynamics
does not always satisfied throughout the history of the universe when we assume
the universe is enclosed by the generalized Ricci scalar radius $R_{gr}$. It
becomes invalid in the near past to the future, and the formation of the
galaxies will be helpful in explaining such phenomenon, for that the galaxies's
formation is an entropy increase process. The negative change rates of the
horizon entropy and internal entropy occur in different period indicates that
the influences of galaxies formation is wiped from internal to the universe's
horizon.

Kulakov for the sake of classifying the laws of Physics. The history of the

is a geometry of one or two sets whose metric function assigns a number to
every pair of points. Its phenomenological symmetry, under Kulakov, means that
for every collection of some finite number of points all of their reciprocal
distances are functionally related. Such geometries are endowed with a group
symmetry under Klein, which is equivalent to the phenomenological symmetry, and
many of them have an essential physical interpretation. That is why they are to
be defined precisely and explored as purely mathematical objects. In this
monograph we treat the mathematical basics of the TPS and present the results
of attempts at classification that have been obtained by now. We hope that the
monograph will be of interest for research workers and teachers, senior and

members' attributes, such as electoral district and party. To gain insight on
the nested structure of communities, we constructed a hierarchical tree of
members from the correlation matrix. Afterwards, we studied parliament dynamics
yearly, with a focus on correlations within and between parties, by also
distinguishing between government and opposition. Finally, we investigated the
role played by specific individuals, at a local level. In particular, whether
they act as proponents who gather consensus, or as signers. Our results provide
a quantitative background to current theories in political science. From a
methodological point of view, our network approach has proven able to highlight
both local and global features of a complex social system.

progressed in separate ways: network analyses of international trade and the
literature on African trade and development. Gathering empirical data on
African countries has important limitations and so does the space occupied by
African countries in the analyses of trade networks. Here, these limitations
are dealt with by the definition of two independent bipartite networks: a
destination share network and\ a\ commodity share network. These networks -
together with their corresponding minimal spanning trees - allow to uncover
some ordering emerging from African exports in the broader context of
international trade. The emerging patterns help to understand important
characteristics of African exports and its binding relations to other economic,
geographic and organizational concerns as the recent literature on African
trade, development and growth has shown.
