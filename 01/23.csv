opportunities for extending the paradigm of quantum transport beyond the realm
of traditional III-V or carbon-based materials. Recent quantum transport
investigations with LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$-based quantum dots have revealed the
existence of a strongly correlated phase in which electrons form spin-singlet
pairs without becoming superconducting. Here we report evidence for
micrometer-scale ballistic transport of electron pairs in quasi-one-dimensional
(quasi-1D) LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ nanowire cavities. In the paired phase,
Fabry-Perot-like quantum interference is observed, in sync with conductance
oscillations observed in the superconducting regime (at zero magnetic field).
Above a critical magnetic field $B_p$, electron pairs unbind and conductance
oscillations shift with magnetic field. These experimental observations extend
the regime of ballistic electronic transport to strongly correlated phases.

for optimizing a net reward function, a linear combination of the reward due to
information spread and cost due to application of controls. The time varying
resource allocation and seeds for the epidemic are jointly optimized. A problem
variation includes a fixed budget constraint. We prove the existence of a
solution for the optimal control problem, provide conditions for uniqueness of
the solution, and prove some structural results for the controls (e.g. controls
are non-increasing functions of time). The solution technique uses Pontryagin's
Maximum Principle and the forward-backward sweep algorithm (and its
modifications) for numerical computations. Our formulations lead to large
optimality systems with up to about 200 differential equations and allow us to
study the effect of network topology (Erdos-Renyi/scale-free) on the controls.
Results reveal that the allocation of campaigning resources to various degree
classes depends not only on the network topology but also on system parameters
such as cost/abundance of resources. The optimal strategies lead to significant
gains over heuristic strategies for various model parameters. Our modeling
approach assumes uncorrelated network, however, we find the approach useful for

theoretically beyond the Dirac point-approximation. Numerical calculations have
been performed within the random phase approximation (RPA). For intra-valley

points in the wave-number dependent quantities, such as dielectric function
$\epsilon(q)$, has been determined by the orientation of the wave-number with
respect to the Dirac point position vector in $k$-space. Therefore identical
contribution of the different Dirac points is not automatically guaranteed by
the degeneracy of the Hamiltonian at these points. Meanwhile it was shown that
the contribution of the inter-valley transitions is always anisotropic even
when the Dirac points coincide with the Fermi level ($E_F=0$). This means that
the Dirac point approximation based studies give the correct physics only at
high wave length limit. The anisotropy of the static dielectric function
reveals different contribution of the each Dirac point. Additionally, the
anisotropic $k$-space dielectric function results in anisotropic Friedel
oscillations in graphene-like materials. Calculations have also been performed
in the presence of the Rashba interaction. It was shown that increasing the

registered to X-ray images. Therefore the 3D-model is matched with the contrast
agent based appearance of the left atrium. Commonly, only small amounts of
contrast agent (CA) are used to locate the left atrium. This is why we focus on
robust registration methods that work also if the structure of interest is only
partially contrasted. In particular, we propose two similarity measures for
CA-based registration: The first similarity measure, explicit apparent edges,
focuses on edges of the patient anatomy made visible by contrast agent and can
be computed quickly on the GPU. The second novel similarity measure computes a
contrast agent distribution estimate (CADE) inside the 3-D model and rates its
consistency with the CA seen in biplane fluoroscopic images. As the CADE
computation involves a reconstruction of CA in 3-D using the CA within the
fluoroscopic images, it is slower. Using a combination of both methods, our
evaluation on 11 well-contrasted clinical datasets yielded an error of
7.9+/-6.3 mm over all frames. For 10 datasets with little CA, we obtained an
error of 8.8+/-6.7 mm. Our new methods outperform a registration based on the

the clustering structure of the population, but is yet to be fully understood
in the way it governs the reproductive process. Here we shed some light on
these dynamics by formulating a $K$-allele Wright--Fisher model for a
population of size $N$, involving a uniform mutation pattern and a specific
state-dependent migration mechanism. Suitably scaled, this process converges in
distribution to a $K$-dimensional diffusion process as $N\to\infty$. Moreover,
the descending order statistics of the $K$-dimensional diffusion converge in
distribution to the two-parameter Poisson--Dirichlet diffusion as $K\to\infty$.
The choice of the migration mechanism depends on a delicate balance between
reinforcement and redistributive effects. The proof of convergence to the
infinite-dimensional diffusion is nontrivial because the generators do not
converge on a core. Our strategy for overcoming this complication is to prove
\textit{a priori} that in the limit there is no ""loss of mass"", i.e., that, for
each limit point of the sequence of finite-dimensional diffusions (after a
reordering of components by size), allele frequencies sum to one.

propose two local optimization based approximation algorithms to efficiently
estimate certain attempt rate parameters of CSMA called fugacities. It is known
that adaptive CSMA can achieve throughput optimality by sampling feasible
schedules from a Gibbs distribution, with appropriate fugacities.
Unfortunately, obtaining these optimal fugacities is an NP-hard problem.
Further, the existing adaptive CSMA algorithms use a stochastic gradient
descent based method, which usually entails an impractically slow (exponential
in the size of the network) convergence to the optimal fugacities. To address
this issue, we first propose an algorithm to estimate the fugacities, that can
support a given set of desired service rates. The convergence rate and the
complexity of this algorithm are independent of the network size, and depend
only on the neighborhood size of a link. Further, we show that the proposed
algorithm corresponds exactly to performing the well-known Bethe approximation
to the underlying Gibbs distribution. Then, we propose another local algorithm
to estimate the optimal fugacities under a utility maximization framework, and
characterize its accuracy. Numerical results indicate that the proposed methods
have a good degree of accuracy, and achieve extremely fast convergence to
near-optimal fugacities, and often outperform the convergence rate of the
stochastic gradient descent by a few orders of magnitude.

activity of the galaxies hosted in the two nearby (z$\sim$0.2) rich galaxy

and unobscured star formation rates, as well as the presence of active galactic
nuclei (AGN) as a function of the environment in which the galaxy is located.
Methods: We targeted the clusters with unprecedented deep infrared Spitzer
observations (0.2 mJy @ 24 micron), near-IR Palomar imaging and optical WIYN
spectroscopy. The extent of our observations ($\sim$ 3 virial radii) covers the
vast range of possible environments, from the very dense cluster centre to the
very rarefied cluster outskirts and accretion regions. Results: The star
forming members of the two clusters present star formation rates comparable
with those measured in coeval field galaxies. The analysis of the spatial
arrangement of the spectroscopically confirmed members reveals an elongated
distribution for A1731 with respect to the more uniform distribution of A983.
The emerging picture is compatible with A983 being a fully evolved cluster, in
contrast with the still actively accreting A1731. Conclusions: The analysis of
the specific star formation rate reveals evidence of on-going galaxy
pre-processing along A1731's filament-like structure. Furthermore, the decrease
in the number of star forming galaxies and AGN towards the cluster cores
suggests that the cluster environment is accelerating the ageing process of
galaxies and blocking further accretion of the cold gas that fuels both star

properties of general-relativistic stellar equilibrium configurations in terms
of functions that do not depend on the specific equation of state employed to
describe matter at nuclear densities. These functions are normally referred to
as ""universal relations"" and have been found to apply, within limits, both to
static or stationary isolated stars, as well as to fully dynamical and merging
binary systems. Further extending the idea that universal relations can be
valid also away from stability, we show that a universal relation is exhibited
also by equilibrium solutions that are not stable. In particular, the mass of
rotating configurations on the turning-point line shows a universal behaviour
when expressed in terms of the normalised Keplerian angular momentum. In turn,
this allows us to compute the maximum mass allowed by uniform rotation,
M_{max}, simply in terms of the maximum mass of the nonrotating configuration,
M_{TOV}, finding that M_{max} ~ (1.203 +- 0.022) M_{TOV} for all the equations
of state we have considered. We further show that a universal relation can be
found between the dimensionless moment of inertia and the stellar compactness.
Although this relation is not surprising as it involves two quantities that
have been shown to exhibit universal behaviour with other stellar properties,
our parameterisation represents a refinement over a similar relation by
Lattimer and Schutz (2005), where a different normalisation was used, and could
provide an accurate tool to constrain the equation of state of nuclear matter
when measurements of the moment of inertia become available.

tomography based on strong or weak measurements carried out on an ensemble of
identically prepared systems. By contrast, the use of protective measurements
offers the possibility of determining quantum states from a series of weak,
long measurements performed on a single system. Because the fidelity of a
protectively measured quantum state is determined by the amount of state
disturbance incurred during each protective measurement, it is crucial that the
initial quantum state of the system is disturbed as little as possible. Here we
show how to systematically minimize the state disturbance in the course of a
protective measurement, thus enabling the maximization of the fidelity of the
quantum-state measurement. Our approach is based on a careful tuning of the
time dependence of the measurement interaction and is shown to be dramatically
more effective in reducing the state disturbance than the previously considered
strategy of weakening the measurement strength and increasing the measurement
time. We describe a method for designing the measurement interaction such that
the state disturbance exhibits polynomial decay to arbitrary order in the
inverse measurement time $1/T$. We also show how one can achieve even faster,
subexponential decay, and we find that it represents the smallest possible
state disturbance in a protective measurement. In this way, our results show
how to optimally measure the state of a single quantum system using protective

General Relativity in the strong-field regime. Such tests, however, require
knowledge of rotating black hole solutions in modified gravity theories, a
class of which does not admit the Kerr metric as a solution. Several rotating
black hole solutions in modified theories have only been found in the
slow-rotation approximation (i.e. assuming the spin angular momentum is much
smaller than the mass squared). We here investigate whether the systematic
error due to the approximate nature of these black hole metrics is small enough
relative to the observational error to allow their use in electromagnetic
observations to constrain deviations from General Relativity. We address this
by considering whether electromagnetic observables constructed from a
slow-rotation approximation to the Kerr metric can fit observables constructed
from the full Kerr metric with systematic errors smaller than current
observational errors. We focus on black hole shadow and continuum spectrum
observations, as these are the least influenced by accretion disk physics, with
current observational errors of about 10%. We find that the fractional
systematic error introduced by using a second-order, slowly-rotating Kerr
metric is at most 2% for shadows created by black holes with dimensionless
spins $\chi\leq0.6$. We also find that the systematic error introduced by using
the slowly-rotating Kerr metric as an exact metric when constructing continuum
spectrum observables is negligible for black holes with dimensionless spins of
$\chi \lesssim 0.9$. Our results suggest that the modified gravity solutions
found in the slow-rotation approximation may be used to constrain realistic

the channel aided IA scheme to the case of interference channel with general

transmitter emits an independent message and each receiver requests an

byproduct, assuming optimal DoF assignment, it is proved that in a general
interference network, there is no user with a unique maximum number of DoF.

  2016",,"10.1093/mnras/stw1907",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show by numerical simulations that a purely stellar dynamical model
composed of an exponential disc, a cuspy bulge, and an NFW halo with parameters
relevant to the Milky Way Galaxy is subject to bar formation. Taking into
account the finite disc thickness, the bar formation can be explained by the
usual bar instability, in spite of the presence of an inner Lindblad resonance,
that is believed to damp any global modes. The effect of replacing the live
halo and bulge by a fixed external axisymmetric potential (rigid models) is
studied. It is shown that while the e-folding time of bar instability increases
significantly (from 250 to 500 Myr), the bar pattern speed remains almost the
same. For the latter, our average value of 55 km/s/kpc agrees with the
assumption that the Hercules stream in the solar neighbourhood is an imprint of
the bar--disc interaction at the outer Lindblad resonance of the bar. Vertical
averaging of the radial force in the central disc region comparable to the
characteristic scale length allows us to reproduce the bar pattern speed and
the growth rate of the rigid models, using normal mode analysis of linear
perturbation theory in a razor thin disc. The strong increase of the e-folding
time with decreasing disc mass predicted by the mode analysis suggests that
bars in galaxies similar to the Milky Way have formed only recently.

mutually trusted parties, are a promising substrate for privacy-preserving
communication due to their inherent membership-concealment and
Sybil-resistance. Yet, existing F2F overlays suffer from a low performance, are
vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, or fail to provide anonymity. In
particular, greedy embeddings allow highly efficient communication in arbitrary
connectivity-restricted overlays but require communicating parties to reveal
their identity. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving routing scheme
for greedy embeddings based on anonymous return addresses rather than
identifying node coordinates. We prove that the presented algorithm are highly
scalalbe, with regard to the complexity of both the routing and the
stabilization protocols. Furthermore, we show that the return addresses provide
plausible deniability for both sender and receiver. We further enhance the
routing's resilience by using multiple embeddings and propose a method for
efficient content addressing. Our simulation study on real-world data indicates
that our approach is highly efficient and effectively mitigates failures as
well as powerful denial-of-service attacks.

quark matter, characterized by an effective bag constant (B_eff) and a
perturbative QCD corrections term (a_4), we construct fully general
relativistic equilibrium sequences of rapidly spinning strange stars for the
first time. Computation of such sequences is important to study millisecond
pulsars and other fast spinning compact stars. Our EoS models can support a
gravitational mass (M_G) and a spin frequency at least up to approximately 3.0
solar mass and approximately 1250 Hz respectively, and hence are fully
consistent with measured M_G and spin frequency values. This paper reports the
effects of B_eff and a_4 on measurable compact star properties, which could be
useful to find possible ways to constrain these fundamental quark matter
parameters, within the ambit of our EoS models. We confirm that a lower B_eff
allows a higher mass. Besides, for known M_G and spin frequency, measurable
parameters, such as stellar radius, radius-to-mass ratio and moment of inertia,
increase with the decrease of B_eff. Our calculations also show that a_4
significantly affects the stellar rest mass and the total stellar binding
energy. As a result, a_4 can have signatures in evolutions of both accreting

and spin and other source parameters. Finally, we compute the parameter values
of two important pulsars, PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J1748-2446ad, which may have
implications to probe their evolutionary histories, and for constraining EoS

transients, the emission mechanisms of which are not understood. Masui et al.
recently presented Green Bank Telescope observations of FRB 110523, which
displayed temporal variation of the linear polarisation position angle (PA).
This effect is commonly seen in radio pulsars and is attributed to a changing
projected magnetic field orientation in the emission region as the star
rotates. If a neutron star is the progenitor of this FRB, and the emission
mechanism is pulsar-like, we show that the progenitor is either rapidly
rotating, or the emission originates from a region of complex magnetic field
geometry. The observed PA variation could also be caused by propagation effects
within a neutron-star magnetosphere, or by spatially varying magnetic fields if
the progenitor lies in a dense, highly magnetised environment. Although we urge
caution in generalising results from FRB 110523 to the broader FRB population,
our analysis serves as a guide to interpreting future polarisation measurements
of FRBs, and presents another means of elucidating the origins of these

Transitions between energy levels are induced by an oscillating driving force
of frequency $\omega$. The driving force is created by oscillating a
macroscopic mass in the neighbourhood of the system of neutrons. The neutrons
decay in 880 seconds while the probability of transitions increase as $t^2$.
Hence the optimal strategy is to drive the system for 2 lifetimes. The
transition amplitude then is of the order of $1.06\times 10^{-5}$ hence with a
million ultra cold neutrons, one should be able to observe transitions.

  In this paper, we focus on (linear) codes whose individual symbols can be

tight upper bound on the minimum distance as a function of number of
information symbols of each locality. We demonstrate that the construction of
Pyramid codes can be adapted to design codes with unequal information locality
that achieve the minimum distance bound. This result generalizes the classical
result of Gopalan et al. for codes with unequal locality. Next, we consider
codes with ""unequal all symbol locality"", and establish an upper bound on the
minimum distance as a function of number of symbols of each locality. We show
that the construction based on rank-metric codes by Silberstein et al. can be
adapted to obtain codes with unequal all symbol locality that achieve the

recently been discovered around galaxies. Based on UV-optical colours, it has
been advocated that the UV haloes around spiral galaxies are due to UV
radiation emitted from the disc and scattered off dust grains at high
latitudes. Detailed UV radiative transfer models that take into account
scattering and absorption can explain the morphology of the UV haloes, and they
require the presence of an additional thick dust disc next the to traditional
thin disc for half of the galaxies in their sample. We test whether such an
additional thick dust disc agrees with the observed infrared emission in NGC
3628, an edge-on galaxy with a clear signature of a thick dust disc. We extend
the far-ultraviolet radiative transfer models to full-scale panchromatic
models. Our model, which contains no fine-tuning, can almost perfectly
reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution from UV to mm wavelengths.
These results corroborate the interpretation of the extended UV emission in NGC
3628 as scattering off dust grains, and hence of the presence of a substantial
amount of diffuse extra-planar dust. A significant caveat, however, is the
geometrical simplicity and non-uniqueness of our model: other models with a
different geometrical setting could lead to a similar spectral energy
distribution. More detailed radiative transfer simulations that compare the
model results to images from UV to submm wavelengths are a way to break this
degeneracy, as are UV polarisation measurements.

been proposed that a specific class of radio-galaxies, compact-steep sources

parent population of F-NLS1s. To test this hypothesis in a quantitative way,in
this paper we analyzed the only two statistically complete samples of CSS/HERGs
and F-NLS1s available in the literature. We derived the black hole mass and
Eddington ratio distributions, and we built for the first time the radio
luminosity function of F-NLS1s. Finally, we applied a relativistic beaming
model to the luminosity function of CSS/HERGs, and compared the result with the
observed function of F-NLS1s. We found that compact steep-spectrum sources are
valid parent candidates and that F-NLS1s, when observed with a different
inclination, might actually appear as CSS/HERGs.

result in decoherence. Smaller time scales in principle avoid this problem, but

Mp=13.98$\pm$1.79 Me and $\rho$=5.94$\pm$0.76 g/cc, significantly lower than
the mass computed in Dumusque et al. (2014, 17.2$\pm$1.9 Me). Internal
compositional modeling reveals that at least $10\%$ of the radius of Kepler-10c
is a volatile envelope composed of hydrogen-helium ($0.2\%$ of the mass, $16\%$
of the radius) or super-ionic water ($28\%$ of the mass, $29\%$ of the radius).
Analysis of only HIRES data yields a higher mass for K10b and a lower mass for
K10c than does analysis of the HARPS-N data alone, with the mass estimates for
K10c formally inconsistent by 3$\sigma$. Splitting the RVs from each instrument
leads to inconsistent measurements for the mass of planet c in each data set.
This suggests that time-correlated noise is present and that the uncertainties
in the planet masses (especially K10c) exceed our formal estimates. Transit
timing variations (TTVs) of K10c indicate the likely presence of a third planet
in the system, KOI-72.X. The TTVs and RVs are consistent with KOI-72.X having
an orbital period of 24, 71, or 101 days, and a mass from 1-7 Me.

estimate the corresponding cross section and its uncertainty, ensuring
conservation of the vector current. While converging to previous calculations
at energies of several MeV, the obtained result is appreciably lower and
predicts more directional positron production near the reaction threshold.
These findings suggest that in the current estimate of the flux of geologically
produced antineutrinos the 232Th and 238U components may be underestimated by
6.1 and 3.7%, respectively. The proposed search for light sterile neutrinos
using a 144Ce--144Pr source is predicted to collect the total event rate lower

be misinterpreted as an oscillation signal. In reactor-antineutrino
experiments, together with a re-evaluation of the positron spectra, the

total field ranges from nearly 10 \mu G at R<2 kpc to 4 \mu G at R=22-24 kpc.
As the random field dominates in M 101, wavelength-independent polarization is
the main polarization mechanism. We show that energetic events causing HI
shells of mean diameter <625 pc could partly be responsible for this. At radii
<24 kpc, the random magnetic field depends on the star formation rate per area
with a power-law exponent of 0.28+-0.02. The ordered magnetic field is
generally aligned with the spiral arms with pitch angles that are about 8{\deg}
larger than those of HI filaments.

lattice bosons in a strong magnetic field in the regime where the tunneling is
much weaker than the on-site interaction strength. We study both dilute, hard
core bosons at filling factors much smaller than unity occupation per site, and
the physics in the vicinity of the superfluid-Mott lobes as the density is
tuned away from unity. For hardcore bosons, we carry out extensive numerics for
a fixed flux per plaquette $\phi=1/5$ and $\phi = 1/3$. At large flux, the
lowest energy state is a strongly correlated superfluid, analogous to He-$4$,
in which the order parameter is dramatically suppressed, but non-zero. At
filling factors $\nu=1/2,1$, we find competing incompressible states which are
metastable. These appear to be commensurate density wave states. For small
flux, the situation is reversed, and the ground state at $\nu = 1/2$ is an
incompressible density-wave solid. Here, we find a metastable lattice
supersolid phase, where superfluidity and density-wave order coexist. We then
perform careful numerical studies of the physics near the vicinity of the Mott
lobes for $\phi = 1/2$ and $\phi = 1/4$. At $\phi = 1/2$, the superfluid ground
state has commensurate density-wave order. At $\phi = 1/4$, incompressible
phases appear outside the Mott lobes at densities $n = 1.125$ and $n = 1.25$,
corresponding to filling fractions $\nu = 1/2$ and $1$ respectively. These
phases, which are absent in single-site mean-field theory are metastable, and
have slightly higher energy than the superfluid, but the energy difference
between them shrinks rapidly with increasing cluster size, suggestive of an
incompressible ground state. We thus explore the interplay between Mott
physics, magnetic Landau levels, and superfluidity, finding a rich phase
diagram of competing compressible and incompressible states.

demonstrating the direct connection between the location of foreground emission
on the sky and its location in cosmological power spectra from interferometric
redshifted 21 cm experiments. We begin with a heuristic formalism for
understanding the mapping of sky coordinates into the cylindrically averaged
power spectra measurements used by 21 cm experiments, with a focus on the
effects of the instrument beam response and the associated sidelobes. We then
demonstrate this mapping by analyzing power spectra with both simulated and
observed data from the Murchison Widefield Array. We find that removing a
foreground model which includes sources in both the main field-of-view and the
first sidelobes reduces the contamination in high k_parallel modes by several
percent relative to a model which only includes sources in the main
field-of-view, with the completeness of the foreground model setting the
principal limitation on the amount of power removed. While small, a
percent-level amount of foreground power is in itself more than enough to
prevent recovery of any EoR signal from these modes. This result demonstrates
that foreground subtraction for redshifted 21 cm experiments is truly a
wide-field problem, and algorithms and simulations must extend beyond the main
instrument field-of-view to potentially recover the full 21 cm power spectrum.

interpretation of sum nodes as marginalized latent variables (LVs). This
interpretation yields an increased syntactic or semantic structure, allows the
application of the EM algorithm and to efficiently perform MPE inference. In
literature, the LV interpretation was justified by explicitly introducing the
indicator variables corresponding to the LVs' states. However, as pointed out
in this paper, this approach is in conflict with the completeness condition in
SPNs and does not fully specify the probabilistic model. We propose a remedy
for this problem by modifying the original approach for introducing the LVs,
which we call SPN augmentation. We discuss conditional independencies in
augmented SPNs, formally establish the probabilistic interpretation of the
sum-weights and give an interpretation of augmented SPNs as Bayesian networks.
Based on these results, we find a sound derivation of the EM algorithm for
SPNs. Furthermore, the Viterbi-style algorithm for MPE proposed in literature
was never proven to be correct. We show that this is indeed a correct
algorithm, when applied to selective SPNs, and in particular when applied to
augmented SPNs. Our theoretical results are confirmed in experiments on
synthetic data and 103 real-world datasets.

forward incorrect packets which then spread through the network leading to

that enables efficient packet verification before forwarding thereby preventing
the pollution attack. In contrast to rateless codes, it utilizes a fixed
low-rate precode and random selection of packets from the set of precoded
packets. The fixed precode admits efficient hash verification of all encoded

dynamic logic (dL) that is entirely based on uniform substitution, a proof rule

substitutions make it possible to use axioms instead of axiom schemata, thereby
substantially simplifying implementations. Instead of subtle schema variables
and soundness-critical side conditions on the occurrence patterns of logical
variables to restrict infinitely many axiom schema instances to sound ones, the
resulting calculus adopts only a finite number of ordinary dL formulas as
axioms, which uniform substitutions instantiate soundly. The static semantics
of differential dynamic logic and the soundness-critical restrictions it
imposes on proof steps is captured exclusively in uniform substitutions and
variable renamings as opposed to being spread in delicate ways across the
prover implementation. In addition to sound uniform substitutions, this article
introduces differential forms for differential dynamic logic that make it
possible to internalize differential invariants, differential substitutions,
and derivatives as first-class axioms to reason about differential equations
axiomatically. The resulting axiomatization of differential dynamic logic is
proved to be sound and relatively complete.

the help of a dictionary, the polar list decoder constantly detects erroneous
paths after every few bits are decoded. This path-pruning technique based on
joint decoding has advantages over stand-alone polar list decoding in that most
decoding errors in early stages are corrected. In order to facilitate the joint
decoding, we first propose a construction of dynamic dictionary using a trie
and show an efficient way to trace the dictionary during decoding. Then we
propose a joint decoding scheme of polar codes taking into account both
information from the channel and the source. The proposed scheme has the same
decoding complexity as the list decoding of polar codes. A list-size adaptive
joint decoding is further implemented to largely reduce the decoding
complexity. We conclude by simulation that the joint decoding schemes
outperform stand-alone polar codes with CRC-aided successive cancellation list
decoding by over 0.6 dB.

boundary types chosen for this study first form ordered complexions, with the
local segregation pattern depending on the grain boundary core structure, then
transform into disordered complexions when the grain boundary composition
reaches a critical value that is temperature dependent. The tendency for this
transition to a disordered interfacial structure consistently depends on the
relative solute excess, instead of the grain boundary energy or misorientation
angle. Grain boundaries with high relative solute excess go through gradual
disordering transitions, whereas those with low relative solute excess remain
ordered until high global Zr concentrations but then abruptly transform into
thick disordered films. The results presented here provide a clear picture of
the effect of interface character on both dopant segregation patterns and

100-m radio telescope since early 2011. This new ROACH-based system enables
bandwidths up to 500 MHz to be recorded, significantly more than what was
possible with its predecessor, the Effelsberg-Berkeley Pulsar Processor (EBPP).
We review the first four years of PSRIX timing data for 33 pulsars collected as
part of the monthly European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) observations. We
describe the automated data analysis pipeline, CoastGuard, that we developed to
reduce these observations. We also introduce TOASTER, the EPTA timing database
used to store timing results, processing information and observation metadata.
Using these new tools, we measure the phase-averaged flux densities at 1.4 GHz
of all 33 pulsars. For 7 of these pulsars, our flux density measurements are
the first values ever reported. For the other 26 pulsars, we compare our flux
density measurements with previously published values. By comparing PSRIX data
with EBPP data, we find an improvement of ~2-5 times in signal-to-noise ratio
achievable, which translates to an increase of ~2-5 times in pulse
time-of-arrival (TOA) precision. We show that such an improvement in TOA
precision will improve the sensitivity to the stochastic gravitational wave
background. Finally, we showcase the flexibility of the new PSRIX backend by
observing several millisecond-period pulsars (MSPs) at 5 and 9 GHz. Motivated
by our detections, we discuss the potential for complementing existing pulsar
timing array data sets with MSP monitoring campaigns at these frequencies.

spin thus it is essentially an Ising \cite{Ising} model. The Hamiltonian also
figures exactly as the anisotropic term in the famous model studied by Haldane
\cite{haldane} of the large spin Heisenberg spin chain \cite{bethe}. Therefore
we call the model the Blume-Capel-Haldane-Ising model. Although the Hamiltonian
is trivially diagonal, it is actually not always obvious which eigenstate is
the ground state. In this paper we establish which state is the ground state
for all regions of the parameter space and thus determine the phase diagram of
the model. We observe the existence of solitons-like excitations and we show
that the size of the solitons depends only on the ratio $a/b$ and not on the
number of sites $N$. Therefore the size of the soliton is an intrinsic property
of the soliton not determined by boundary conditions.

we adapt the standard Green theorem to include the effects of the $\theta$

moderate problems caused by insufficient measurements in single-sensor systems.
These systems allow simultaneous data acquisition in multiple sensors, thus
alleviating such problems by providing more overall measurements. In this work
we consider the combination of compressed sensing with parallel acquisition. We
establish the theoretical improvements of such systems by providing recovery
guarantees for which, subject to appropriate conditions, the number of
measurements required per sensor decreases linearly with the total number of
sensors. Throughout, we consider two different sampling scenarios -- distinct
(corresponding to independent sampling in each sensor) and identical
(corresponding to dependent sampling between sensors) -- and a general
mathematical framework that allows for a wide range of sensing matrices (e.g.,
subgaussian random matrices, subsampled isometries, random convolutions and
random Toeplitz matrices). We also consider not just the standard sparse signal
model, but also the so-called sparse in levels signal model. This model
includes both sparse and distributed signals and clustered sparse signals. As
our results show, optimal recovery guarantees for both distinct and identical
sampling are possible under much broader conditions on the so-called sensor
profile matrices (which characterize environmental conditions between a source

verify our recovery guarantees we provide numerical results showing phase

reconstruction with sparsity-exploiting methods, such as total variation (TV)
minimization, inspired by compressive sensing, potentially claims large
reductions in sampling requirements. However, a quantitative notion of this
claim is non-trivial because of the ill-defined reduction in sampling achieved
by the sparsity-exploiting method. In this paper, exact reconstruction sampling
condition for limited-view problem is studied by verifying the uniqueness of
solution in TV minimization model. Uniqueness is tested by solving a convex
optimization problem derived from the sufficient and necessary condition of
solution uniqueness. Through this method, the sufficient sampling number of
exact reconstruction is quantified for any fixed phantom and settled
geometrical parameter in the limited-view problem. This paper provides a
reference to quantify the sampling condition. Using Shepp-Logan phantom as an
example, the experiment results show the quantified sampling number and
indicate that an object would be accurately reconstructed as the scanning range
becomes narrower by increasing sampling number. The increased samplings
compensate for the deficiency of the projection angle. However, a lower bound
of the scanning range is presented, in which an exact reconstruction cannot be
obtained once the projection angle is narrowed to this extent no matter how to
increase sampling.

  Dissipation and Sequential Reverse Water-Filling","This paper will be submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Information
  Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of distributed lossy linear function computation in a
tree network. We examine two cases: (i) data aggregation (only one sink node
computes) and (ii) consensus (all nodes compute the same function). By
quantifying the accumulation of information loss in distributed computing, we
obtain fundamental limits on network computation rate as a function of
incremental distortions (and hence incremental loss of information) along the
edges of the network. The above characterization, based on quantifying
distortion accumulation, offers an improvement over classical cut-set type
techniques which are based on overall distortions instead of incremental
distortions. This quantification of information loss qualitatively resembles
information dissipation in cascaded channels [1]. Surprisingly, this
accumulation effect of distortion happens even at infinite blocklength.
Combining this observation with an inequality on the dominance of mean-square
quantities over relative-entropy quantities, we obtain outer bounds on the rate
distortion function that are tighter than classical cut-set bounds by a
difference which can be arbitrarily large in both data aggregation and
consensus. We also obtain inner bounds on the optimal rate using random
Gaussian coding, which differ from the outer bounds by $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{D})$,
where $D$ is the overall distortion. The obtained inner and outer bounds can
provide insights on rate (bit) allocations for both the data aggregation
problem and the consensus problem. We show that for tree networks, the rate
allocation results have a mathematical structure similar to classical reverse
water-filling for parallel Gaussian sources.

systems and scales from planets to superclusters of galaxies and in very low
density intergalactic media. The upper limit of primordial magnetic fields
(PMF) has been set by recent observations by the Planck observatory (2015) to
be of the order of a few nG. The simple model ${f^2}FF$ used to generate the
PMF during the inflation era. It is based on the breaking of conformal symmetry
of electromagnetism during inflation. It is attractive because it is stable
under perturbations and leads to a scale invariant PMF. However, it may suffer
from two problems: Backreaction and strong coupling. In the first case, the
electromagnetic energy may exceed the energy of inflation, ${\rho
_{{\rm{Inf}}}}$. In the second case, the effective electric charges become
excessively large if we want to retrieve the standard electromagnetism at the
end of inflation. In this research, we investigate the generation of PMF under
three different models of inflation in order to avoid the backreaction problem.
We compute magnetic and electric spectra generated by the ${f^2}FF$ model in
the context of large field inflation (LFI), natural inflation (NI) and
${R^2}$-inflation, for all possible values of model parameters for de Sitter
and power law expansion of inflation. The results of the research show that the
scale invariant PMF can be generated in these models and the problem of
backreaction may be avoided in some observational ranges. In $R^2$-inflation,
which is preferred by the recent results of Planck 2015, we calculate the upper
of the scale invariant PMF generated by ${f^2}FF$ and in turns we find that the
upper limit of present magnetic field, ${B_0} < 8.058 \times {10^{ -

various techniques to improve their prospective memory performance. Setting up
a reminder is one of the most important techniques. The existing studies
provide evidences in support of using reminders to cope with prospective memory
failures. However, people are not satisfied with existing reminders because of
their limitations in different aspects including reliability, optimization, and
adaption.
  Through analysing the functions and features of existing reminder systems,
this book draft summarizes their advantages and limitations. We are motivated
to improve the performance of reminder systems. For the improvements, the
relevant theories and mechanisms of prospective memory from psychology must be
complied with, incorporated, and applied in this new study.
  Based on the literature review, a new reminder model is proposed, which
includes a novel reminder planer, a prospective memory based agent, and a
personalized user model. The reminder planer is responsible for determining the
optimal reminder plan (including the optimal number of reminders, the optimal
reminding schedule and the optimal reminding way). The prospective memory agent
is responsible for executing the reminding processes. The personalized user

human-system interactions and is responsible for adapting the reminder plan to

minimizes a weighted combination of a convex loss function and of a convex
(typically, non-smooth) regularizer. We accurately predict the squared error
performance of such estimators in the high-dimensional proportional regime. The
random measurement matrix is assumed to have entries iid Gaussian, only minimal
and rather mild regularity conditions are imposed on the loss function, the
regularizer, and on the noise and signal distributions. We show that the error
converges in probability to a nontrivial limit that is given as the solution to
a minimax convex-concave optimization problem on four scalar optimization
variables. We identify a new summary parameter, termed the Expected Moreau
envelope to play a central role in the error characterization. The
\emph{precise} nature of the results permits an accurate performance comparison
between different instances of regularized M-estimators and allows to optimally
tune the involved parameters (e.g. regularizer parameter, number of
measurements). The key ingredient of our proof is the \emph{Convex Gaussian
Min-max Theorem} (CGMT) which is a tight and strengthened version of a
classical Gaussian comparison inequality that was proved by Gordon in 1988.

iTRAQ technique has been widely adopted for high throughput protein profiling,
as it enables one to measure multiple samples simultaneously in one multiplex
experiment and thus greatly enhances the throughput of protein quantification.
However, the technical variation across different iTRAQ multiplex experiments
is often large due to the dynamic nature of MS instruments. This leads to
strong batch effects in the iTRAQ data. Moreover, the iTRAQ data often contain
substantial batch-level non-ignorable missingness. Specifically, the abundance
measures of a given protein/peptide are often missing altogether in all the
samples from the same batch, with the missing probability depending on the
combined batch-level abundances. We term this unique missing-data mechanism as
the Batch-level Abundance-Dependent Missing-data mechanism (BADMM). We
introduce a new method, mixEMM, for analyzing iTRAQ data with batch effects and
batch-level non-ignorable missingness. The mixEMM method employs a linear
mixed-effects model and explicitly models the batch effects and the BADMM in
the likelihood function. With simulation studies, we showed that compared with
existing approaches that utilize relative abundances and ignore the missing
batches under the missing completely at random assumption, the mixEMM method
achieves more accurate parameter estimation and inference.We applied the method
to an iTRAQ proteomics data from a breast cancer study and identified
phosphopeptides differentially expressed between different breast cancer
subtypes. The method can be applied to general clustered data with cluster

transmission in a single cell of a multi-channel (e.g., OFDM-based) cellular
network. These works have been quite promising in that they have developed
low-complexity index scheduling policies that are delay-optimal (in a large
deviation rate-function sense). However, these policies require that the
channel is ON or OFF in each time-slot with a fixed probability (i.e., there is
no memory in the system), while the reality is that due to channel fading and
doppler shift, channels are often time-correlated in these cellular systems.
Thus, an important open question is whether one can find simple index
scheduling policies that are delay-optimal even when the channels are
time-correlated. In this paper, we attempt to answer this question for
time-correlated ON/OFF channels. In particular, we show that the class of
oldest packets first (OPF) policies that give a higher priority to packets with
a large delay is delay rate-function optimal under two conditions: 1) The
channel is non-negatively correlated, and 2) The distribution of the OFF period
is geometric. We use simulations to further elucidate the theoretical results.

the most expressive tool among the current feature diagram languages. The most
common characterization of the semantics of a cardinality-based diagram is the
set of flat multisets over features satisfying the constraints. However, this

by proposing another multiset theory for the cardinality-based feature diagram,

captures all information of the diagram so that one can retrieve the diagram
from its hierarchical semantics. We also characterize sets of multisets, which

with a goal-oriented approach that resembles human behaviours, and an agent

are limitations on existing Goal Net Designer, the design and modelling
component of the agent designer. Those limitations, including limited access,
difficult deployment, inflexibility in user operations, design workflows
against typical Goal Net methodology workflows, and lack of data protection,

from all major desktop operating systems, as well as in web environment via all

there is still a gap between theoretical models and practical implementation of

methods for automatic recognition would be strongly desired. Although methods
for automatic speech recognition for application purposes have been intensively
studied, blindly applying them for biological purposes may not be an optimal
solution. This is because, unlike human speech recognition, analysis of
sequential vocalizations often requires accurate extraction of timing
information. In the present study we propose automated systems suitable for
recognizing birdsong, one of the most intensively investigated sequential
vocalizations, focusing on the three properties of the birdsong. First, a song
is a sequence of vocal elements, called notes, which can be grouped into
categories. Second, temporal structure of birdsong is precisely controlled,
meaning that temporal information is important in song analysis. Finally, notes
are produced according to certain probabilistic rules, which may facilitate the
accurate song recognition. We divided the procedure of song recognition into
three sub-steps: local classification, boundary detection, and global
sequencing, each of which corresponds to each of the three properties of
birdsong. We compared the performances of several different ways to arrange
these three steps. As results, we demonstrated a hybrid model of a deep neural
network and a hidden Markov model is effective in recognizing birdsong with
variable note sequences. We propose suitable arrangements of methods according
to whether accurate boundary detection is needed. Also we designed the new
measure to jointly evaluate the accuracy of note classification and boundary
detection. Our methods should be applicable, with small modification and
tuning, to the songs in other species that hold the three properties of the
sequential vocalization.

(CGM) surrounding galaxies. The CGM is also found to contain substantial
amounts of metals and dust, which require some transport mechanism. We consider
AGN (active galactic nucleus) feedback-driven outflows based on radiation
pressure on dust. Dusty gas is ejected when the central luminosity exceeds the
effective Eddington luminosity for dust. We obtain that a higher dust-to-gas
ratio leads to a lower critical luminosity, implying that the more dusty gas is
more easily expelled. Dusty outflows can reach large radii with a range of
velocities (depending on the outflowing shell configuration and the ambient
density distribution) and may account for the observed CGM gas. In our picture,
dust is required in order to drive AGN feedback, and the preferential expulsion
of dusty gas in the outflows may naturally explain the presence of dust in the
CGM. On the other hand, the most powerful AGN outflow events can potentially
drive gas out of the local galaxy group. We further discuss the effects of
radiation pressure of the central AGN on satellite galaxies. AGN radiative
feedback may therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of the whole

fire-front is the sum of a drifting component (obtained from an existing
wildfire simulator without turbulence and fire-spotting) and a random
fluctuating component. The modelling of the random effects is embodied in a
probability density function accounting for the fluctuations around the fire
perimeter which is given by the drifting component. In past, this formulation
has been applied to include these random effects into a wildfire simulator
based on an Eulerian moving interface method, namely the Level Set Method
(LSM), but in this paper the same formulation is adapted for a wildfire
simulator based on a Lagrangian front tracking technique, namely the Discrete
Event System Specification (DEVS). The main highlight of the present study is
the comparison of the performance of a Lagrangian and an Eulerian moving
interface method when applied to wild-land fire propagation. Simple idealised
numerical experiments are used to investigate the potential applicability of
the proposed formulation to DEVS and to compare its behaviour with respect to
the LSM. The results show that DEVS based wildfire propagation model
qualitatively improves its performance (e.g., reproducing flank and back fire,
increase in fire spread due to pre-heating of the fuel by hot air and
firebrands, fire propagation across no fuel zones, secondary fire generation,
\dots). Though the results presented here are devoid of any validation exercise
and provide only a proof of concept, they show a strong inclination towards an
intended operational use. The existing LSM or DEVS based operational simulators
like WRF-SFIRE and ForeFire respectively can serve as an ideal basis for the
same.

  for all n>24",,,,,"cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Burnt pancakes problem was defined by Gates and Papadimitriou in 1979. A
stack S of pancakes with a burnt side must be sorted by size, the smallest on
top, and each pancake with burnt side down. Only operation allowed is to split
stack in two parts and flip upper part. g(S) is the minimal number of flips
needed to sort stack S. Stack S may be -In when pancakes are in right order but
upside down or -f_n when all pancakes are right side up but sorted in reverse
order. Gates et al. proved that g(-f_n)>=3n/2-1.
  In 1995 Cohen and Blum proved that g(-I_n)=g(-f_n)+1>=3n/2.
  In 1997 Heydari and Sudborough proved that g(-I_n)<= 3(n+1)/2 whenever some
fortuitous sequence of flips exists. They gave fortuitous sequences for n=3,
15, 27 and 31. They showed that two fortuitous sequences S_n and S_n' may
combine into another fortuitous sequence S_n'' with n''=n+n'-3. So a fortuitous
sequence S_n gives a fortuitous sequence S_{n+12}. This proves that
g(-I_n)<=3(n+1)/2 if n is congruent to 3 modulo 4 and n>=23.
  In 2011 Josef Cibulka enhanced Gates and Papadimitriou's lower bound thanks
to a potential function. He got so g(-I_n)>=3n/2+1 if n>1 proving thereby, that
g(-I_n)=3(n+1)/2 if n is congruent to 3 modulo 4 and n>=23.
  This paper explains how to build generalized fortuitous sequences for every
n>=25 proving thereby that g(-I_n)=ceiling(3n/2)+1 for every n>=25.

their gauge couplings and characteristic energy scale in the UV-domain of
UV-stable fixed point of strong four-fermion coupling, then mainly focus the
discussions on the decay channels of composite particles into the final states
of the SM gauge bosons, leptons and quarks. We calculate the rates of composite
bosons decaying into two gauge bosons $\gamma\gamma$, $\gamma Z^0$, $W^+W^-$,
$Z^0Z^0$ and give the ratios of decay rates of different channels depending on
gauge couplings only. It is shown that a composite fermion decays into an
elementary fermion and a composite boson, the latter being an intermediate
state decays into two gauge bosons, leading to a peculiar kinematics of final
states of a quark (or a lepton) and two gauge bosons. These provide
experimental implications of such an effective theory of composite particles
beyond the SM. We also present some speculative discussions on the channels of
composite fermions decaying into $WW$, $WZ$ and $ZZ$ two boson-tagged jets with
quark jets, or to four-quark jets. Moreover, at the same energy scale of
composite particles produced in high-energy experiments, composite particles
are also produced by high-energy sterile neutrino (dark matter) collisions,
their decays lead to excesses of cosmic ray particles in space and signals of
SM particles in underground laboratories.

rewrite the Mattig relation with correction terms from the Gauss-Bonnet

used to find the distance modulus and for the case where the Gauss-Bonnet field
equations can be expressed as a small high z perturbation on the standard
Einstein field equations. As a result we can express the perturbative distance
modulus, which includes the apparent magnitude, as an additive correction to
the standard distance modulus. This results in a small shift in the apparent
magnitude of a high z object which gives a contribution depending on the
Gauss-Bonnet coupling, spacetime dimension and the cosmological constant.

measurements within a target star system. To allow for extended in-situ
measurements, the spacecraft needs to be decelerated. One of the currently most
promising technologies for deceleration is the magnetic sail which uses the
deflection of interstellar matter via a magnetic field to decelerate the
spacecraft. However, while the magnetic sail is very efficient at high
velocities, its performance decreases with lower speeds. This leads to
deceleration durations of several decades depending on the spacecraft mass.
Within the context of Project Dragonfly, initiated by the Initiative of
Interstellar Studies (i4is), this paper proposes a novel concept for
decelerating a spacecraft on an interstellar mission by combining a magnetic
sail with an electric sail. Combining the sails compensates for each
technologys shortcomings: A magnetic sail is more effective at higher
velocities than the electric sail and vice versa. It is demonstrated that using
both sails sequentially outperforms using only the magnetic or electric sail
for various mission scenarios and velocity ranges, at a constant total
spacecraft mass. For example, for decelerating from 5% c, to interplanetary
velocities, a spacecraft with both sails needs about 29 years, whereas the
electric sail alone would take 35 years and the magnetic sail about 40 years
with a total spacecraft mass of 8250 kg. Furthermore, it is assessed how the
combined deceleration system affects the optimal overall mission architecture
for different spacecraft masses and cruising speeds. Future work would
investigate how operating both systems in parallel instead of sequentially
would affect its performance. Moreover, uncertainties in the density of
interstellar matter and sail properties need to be explored.
