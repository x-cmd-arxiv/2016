  Maximal Independent Set Selection and Greedy Colouring","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1211.0235",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose distributed algorithms for two well-established problems that
operate efficiently under extremely harsh conditions. Our algorithms achieve
state-of-the-art performance in a simple and novel way.
  Our algorithm for maximal independent set selection operates on a network of
identical anonymous processors. The processor at each node has no prior
information about the network. At each time step, each node can only broadcast
a single bit to all its neighbours, or remain silent. Each node can detect
whether one or more neighbours have broadcast, but cannot tell how many of its
neighbours have broadcast, or which ones. We build on recent work of Afek et
al. which was inspired by studying the development of a network of cells in the
fruit fly~\cite{Afek2011a}. However we incorporate for the first time another
important feature of the biological system: varying the probability value used
at each node based on local feedback from neighbouring nodes. Given any
$n$-node network, our algorithm achieves the optimal expected time complexity
of $O(\log n)$ rounds and the optimal expected message complexity of $O(1)$
single-bit messages broadcast by each node.We also show that the previous
approach, without feedback, cannot achieve better than $\Omega(\log^2 n)$
expected time complexity, whatever global scheme is used to choose the
probabilities.
  Our algorithm for distributed greedy colouring works under similar harsh
conditions: each identical node has no prior information about the network, can
only broadcast a single message to all neighbours at each time step
representing a desired colour, and can only detect whether at least one
neighbour has broadcast each colour value. We show that our algorithm has an
expected time complexity of $O(\Delta+\log n)$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum
degree of the network, and expected message complexity of $O(1)$ messages
broadcast by each node.

where the selfish agents cannot reach a binding agreement on the way they would
share the infrastructure. Many approaches have been proposed for mitigating the
typically inefficient operating points. However, in a growing number of
networking scenarios selfish agents are able to communicate and reach an
agreement. Hence, the degradation of performance should be considered at an
operating point of a cooperative game. Accordingly, our goal is to lay
foundations for the application of cooperative game theory to fundamental
problems in networking. We explain our choice of the Nash Bargaining Scheme
(NBS) as the solution concept, and introduce the Price of Selfishness (PoS),
which considers the degradation of performance at the worst NBS. We focus on
the fundamental load balancing game of routing over parallel links. First, we
consider agents with identical performance objectives. We show that, while the
PoA here can be large, through bargaining, all agents, and the system, strictly
improve their performance. Interestingly, in a two-agent system or when all
agents have identical demands, we establish that they reach social optimality.
We then consider agents with different performance objectives and demonstrate
that the PoS and PoA can be unbounded, yet we explain why both measures are
unsuitable. Accordingly, we introduce the Price of Heterogeneity (PoH), as an
extension of the PoA. We establish an upper-bound on the PoH and indicate its
further motivation for bargaining. Finally, we discuss network design
guidelines that follow from our findings

plants has increased to significant levels in several power systems across

operators (TSOs) have responded by increasing their reserve capacity

issue of efficiently incorporating these new types of wind power control in the

wind power control. The framework is based on an optimal power flow formulation
with weighted chance constraints, which accounts for the uncertainty of wind
power forecasts and allows us to limit the risk of constraint violations. In a
case study based on the IEEE 118 bus system, we use the developed method to
assess the effectiveness of different types of wind power control in terms of

knowledge about these transitions comes from systems exhibiting the
multistability of spatially uniform states. In spatially extended and,
particularly, in pattern-forming systems, there are many possible scenarios for
transitions between alternative states. Quenched disorder may affect the
dynamics, bifurcation diagrams and critical transitions in nonlinear systems.
However, only a few studies have explored the effects of quenched disorder on
pattern-forming systems, either experimentally or by using theoretical models.
Here, we use a fundamental model describing pattern formation, the
Swift-Hohenberg model and a well-explored mathematical model describing the
dynamics of vegetation in drylands to study the effects of quenched disorder on
critical transitions in pattern-forming systems. We find that the disorder
affects the patterns formed by introducing an interplay between the imposed
pattern and the self-organized one. We show that, in both systems considered
here, the disorder significantly increases the durability of the patterned
state and makes the transition between the patterned state and the uniform
state more gradual. In addition, the disorder induces hysteresis in the
response of the system to changes in the bifurcation parameter well before the
critical transition occurs. We also show that the cross-correlation between the
disordered parameter and the dynamical variable can serve as an early indicator
for an imminent critical transition.

profiles of the oscillating functions and of functionals. Our abstract result
is a lower bound for such energies in terms of a cell problem (on large
expanding cells) and the $\Gamma$-limits of the functionals at the microscale.
We show that our method allows to retrieve the results of Dal Maso and Modica
in the well-known case of the stochastic homogenization of convex Lagrangians.
As an application, we also show how our method allows to stochastically
homogenize a variational problem introduced and studied by Alberti and
M\""uller, which is a paradigm of a problem where an additional mesoscale arises
naturally due to the non-convexity of the singular perturbation (lower order)

technique in studying the secular evolution of the hierarchical three-body
system. We show that effects stemmed from the short-timescale oscillations
ignored by DA can accumulate over long timescales and lead to significant
errors in the long-term evolution of the Lidov-Kozai cycles. In particular, the
conditions for having an orbital flip, where the inner orbit switches between
prograde and retrograde with respect to the outer orbit and the associated
extremely high eccentricities during the switch, can be modified significantly.
The failure of DA can arise for a relatively strong perturber where the mass of
the tertiary is considerable compared to the total mass of the inner binary.
This issue can be relevant for astrophysical systems such as stellar triples,
planets in stellar binaries, stellar-mass binaries orbiting massive black holes
and moons of the planets perturbed by the Sun. We derive analytical equations
for the short-term oscillations of the inner orbit to the leading order for all
inclinations, eccentricities and mass ratios. Under the test particle
approximation, we derive the ""corrected double-averaging"" (CDA) equations by
incorporating the effects of short-term oscillations into the DA. By comparing
to N-body integrations, we show that the CDA equations successfully correct
most of the errors of the long-term evolution under the DA approximation for a
large range of initial conditions. We provide an implementation of CDA that can
be directly added to codes employing DA equations.

evolution: the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). Recent results obtained for
Galactic globular clusters (GCs) suggest that the AGB stage may contain crucial
information about the evolutionary history of exotic stars (Beccari et al.
2006) and multiple-populations (Campbell et al. 2013) in the parent cluster.
The thesis presents the analysis of a large sample of high-resolution spectra
of AGB stars in four Galactic GCs, acquired at the Very Large Telescope (ESO)
and the 2.2 meter telescope (MPG). The obtained results provide evidence of a
previously unknown physical mechanism affecting the neutral species of some
chemical elements in the atmosphere of most AGB stars: because of it, the
abundances derived from neutral lines are systematically underestimated, while
those measured from ionized lines remain unaffected. Such a behaviour exactly
corresponds to what expected in the case of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium
(NLTE) conditions in the star atmosphere. For this reason, in this work we
refer to it as ""NLTE effect"", with the caveat that this could be not the case.
In fact, the current NLTE models are unable to account for the observed effect,
thus demonstrating that either our comprehension of NLTE is not adequate
enough, or that some more complex physical phenomena are occurring in AGB
atmospheres. This effect has been found in all the investigated GCs. It affects
most (but not all) AGB stars and, in some cases, also some RGB stars. It is
particularly evident for iron and titanium lines (i.e., the elements providing
the largest number of both neutral and ionized lines). The deep understanding
of the detected phenomenon is of paramount importance since it has a huge
impact on the proper determination of GC chemistry and enrichment history (for
instance, it can mimic spurious iron spreads).

in laboratory studies, and this mechanism has been proposed to play a role in
the control of the ortho-para ratio in the interstellar medium. Observations of
rotational lines of H2 in Photo-Dissociation Regions (PDRs) have indeed found
significantly lower ortho-para ratios than expected at equilibrium. The
mechanisms controlling the balance of the ortho-para ratio in the interstellar
medium thus remain incompletely understood, while this ratio can affect the
thermodynamical properties of the gas (equation of state, cooling function).
Aims: We aim to build an accurate model of ortho-para conversion on dust
surfaces based on the most recent experimental and theoretical results, and to
validate it by comparison to observations of H2 rotational lines in PDRs.
Methods: We propose a statistical model of ortho-para conversion on dust grains
with fluctuating dust temperatures, based on a master equation approach. This
computation is then coupled to full PDR models and compared to PDR
observations. Results: We show that the observations of rotational H2 lines
indicate a high conversion efficiency on dust grains, and that this high
efficiency can be accounted for if taking dust temperature fluctuations into
account with our statistical model of surface conversion. Simpler models
neglecting the dust temperature fluctuations do not reach the high efficiency
deduced from the observations. Moreover, this high efficiency induced by dust
temperature fluctuations is quite insensitive to the values of microphysical
parameters of the model. Conclusions: Ortho-para conversion on grains is thus
an efficient mechanism in most astrophysical conditions that can play a
significant role in controlling the ortho-para ratio.

reconstruction searches for a microstructure with prescribed statistical

paper we focus on the lineal path function designed to capture namely
short-range effects and phase connectedness, which can be hardly handled by the
commonly used two-point probability function. The usage of the lineal path
function is, however, significantly limited by huge computational requirements.
So as to examine the properties of the lineal path function within the

with the acceleration of the lineal path evaluation, namely by porting part of
its code to the graphics processing unit using the CUDA (Compute Unified Device

comparison of the entire lineal path function with the commonly used rough
approximation based on the Monte Carlo and/or sampling template. Moreover, the
accelerated version of the lineal path function is then compared with the

the impersonal laws of nature; the ""I"" never makes an appearance in it. Since
the advent of quantum theory, however, there has always been a nagging pressure
to insert a first-person perspective into the heart of physics. In incarnations
of lesser or greater strength, one may consider the ""Copenhagen"" views of Bohr,
Heisenberg, and Pauli, the observer-participator view of John Wheeler, the

emphasize that rather than relinquishing the idea of reality (as they are often
accused of), they are saying that reality is more than any third-person
perspective can capture. Thus, far from instances of instrumentalism or
antirealism, these views of quantum theory should be regarded as attempts to
make a deep statement about the nature of reality. This paper explicates the
idea for the case of QBism. As well, it highlights the influence of John
Wheeler's ""law without law"" on QBism's formulation.

interconnected dynamical systems based on observations made at a small number
(possibly one) of its nodes. In contrast to classical identification of full
graph topology, we focus on the identification of the spectral graph-theoretic
properties of the network, a framework that we call spectral network
identification.
  The main theoretical results connect the spectral properties of the network
to the spectral properties of the dynamics, which are well-defined in the
context of the so-called Koopman operator and can be extracted from data
through the Dynamic Mode Decomposition algorithm. These results are obtained
for networks of diffusively-coupled units that admit a stable equilibrium
state. For large networks, a statistical approach is considered, which focuses
on spectral moments of the network and is well-suited to the case of
heterogeneous populations.
  Our framework provides efficient numerical methods to infer global
information on the network from sparse local measurements at a few nodes.
Numerical simulations show for instance the possibility of detecting the mean
number of connections or the addition of a new vertex using measurements made
at one single node, that need not be representative of the other nodes'
properties.

the generated C lines, unveiling a M\""obius strip structure in the main axis of
the polarization ellipse. These results prove that high-index nanoparticles are

essential in the era of big data. The scaling of kernel-based learning
algorithms to large datasets is limited by the O(n^2) computation and storage
complexity of the full kernel matrix, which is required by most of the recent
kernel learning algorithms.
  We present the Mklaren algorithm to approximate multiple kernel matrices
learn a regression model, which is entirely based on geometrical concepts. The
algorithm does not require access to full kernel matrices yet it accounts for
the correlations between all kernels. It uses Incomplete Cholesky
decomposition, where pivot selection is based on least-angle regression in the
combined, low-dimensional feature space. The algorithm has linear complexity in
the number of data points and kernels. When explicit feature space induced by
the kernel can be constructed, a mapping from the dual to the primal Ridge
regression weights is used for model interpretation.
  The Mklaren algorithm was tested on eight standard regression datasets. It
outperforms contemporary kernel matrix approximation approaches when learning
with multiple kernels. It identifies relevant kernels, achieving highest
explained variance than other multiple kernel learning methods for the same
number of iterations. Test accuracy, equivalent to the one using full kernel
matrices, was achieved with at significantly lower approximation ranks. A
difference in run times of two orders of magnitude was observed when either the
number of samples or kernels exceeds 3000.

performing density matrix renormalization group computations on the

scaling faithfully predicts the equilibrium critical exponents for the

associate multiple times in any direction is a useful model for patchy
colloidal mixtures. Despite the simplicity of the interaction, because of the
presence of multi-body correlations predicting the thermodynamics of such
systems remains a challenge. Earlier Marshall and Chapman developed a
multi-body formulation for such systems wherein the cluster partition function
for the hard-sphere solvent molecules in a defined inner-shell (or coordination
volume) of the hard-sphere solute is used as the reference within the
statistical association fluid theory formalism. The multi-body contribution to
these partition functions are obtained by ignoring the bulk solvent, thus
limiting the applicability of the theory to low system densities. Deriving
inspiration from the quasichemical theory of solutions where these partition
functions occur in the guise of equilibrium constants for cluster formation, we
develop a way to account for the multi-body correlations including the effect
of the bulk solvent. We obtain the free energy to evacuate the inner-shell, the
chemistry contribution within quasichemical theory, from simulations of the
hard-sphere reference. This chemistry contribution reflects association in the
reference in the presence of the bulk medium. The gas-phase partition functions
are then augmented by a mean activity factor that is adjusted to reproduce the
chemistry contribution. We show that the updated partition function provides a
revised reference that better captures the distribution of solvent around the
solute up to high system densities. Using this updated reference, we find that
theory better describes both the bonding state and the excess chemical
potential of the colloid in the physical system.

applications, using the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) as a
scientific and methodological testbed. The ability to respond rapidly to the
potentially most interesting events is a key bottleneck that limits the
scientific returns from the current and anticipated synoptic sky surveys.
Similar challenge arise in other contexts, from environmental monitoring using
sensor networks to autonomous spacecraft systems. Given the exponential growth
of data rates, and the time-critical response, we need a fully automated and
robust approach. We describe the results obtained to date, and the possible

was observed by the EUVI aboard the behind STEREO spacecraft in 171 {\AA} and
304 {\AA} on 2014 September 10, from a location where data from the SDO could
not observe. The jets (J1$-$J6) recurred for six times with intervals of 5$-$15
minutes. They originated from the same primary CBP (BP1) and propagated in the
northeast direction along large-scale, closed coronal loops. Two of the jets
(J3 and J6) produced sympathetic CBPs (BP2 and BP3) after reaching the remote
footpoints of the loops. The time delays between the peak times of BP1 and BP2
(BP3) are 240$\pm$75 s (300$\pm75$ s). The jets were not coherent. Instead,
they were composed of bright and compact blobs. The sizes and apparent
velocities of the blobs are 4.5$-$9 Mm and 140$-$380 km/s, respectively. The
arrival times of the multiple blobs in the jets at the far-end of the loops
indicate that the sympathetic CBPs are caused by jet flows rather than thermal
conduction fronts. The second group was observed by the AIA aboard SDO in
various wavelengths on 2010 August 3. Similar to the first group, the jets
originated from a short-lived bright point (BP) at the boundary of AR 11092 and
propagated along a small-scale, closed loop before flowing into the active
region. Several tiny blobs with sizes of $\sim$1.7 Mm and apparent velocity of
~238 km/s were identified in the jets. We carried out the DEM inversions to
investigate the temperatures of the blobs, finding that the blobs were
multithermal with average temperature of 1.8$-$3.1 MK.

K-type temporal transitional channel flow. Based on the Eulerian velocity field
from the DNS, a backward-particle-tracking method is applied to solve the
transport equation of the Lagrangian scalar field, and then the iso-surfaces of
the Lagrangian field can be extracted as material surfaces in the evolution.
Three critical issues for Lagrangian investigations on the evolution of
coherent structures using material surfaces are addressed. First, the initial
scalar field is uniquely determined based on proposed criteria, so that the
initial material surfaces can be approximated as vortex surfaces, and keep
invariant in the initial laminar state. Second, the evolution of typical
material surfaces initially from different wall distances is presented, and
then the influential material surface with the maximum deformation is
identified. Large vorticity variations with the maximum curvature growth of
vortex lines are also observed on this surface. Moreover, crucial events in the
transition can be characterized in a Lagrangian approach by conditional
statistics on the material surfaces. Finally, the influential material surface,
which is initially a vortex surface, is demonstrated as a surrogate of the
vortex surface before significant topological changes of vortical structures.
Therefore, this material surface can be used to elucidate the continuous
evolution of vortical structures in transitional wall-bounded flows in a
Lagrangian perspective. The evolution of the influential material surface is
divided into three stages: the formation of a triangular bulge from an
initially disturbed streamwise-spanwise sheet, rolling up of the vortex sheet
near the bulge ridges with the vorticity intensification, and the generation
and evolution of signature hairpin-like structures with self-induced dynamics
of vortex filaments.

[2], in which a wiretapper is allowed to produce a list of $2^{mR_{L}}$

equivalent to the one with secrecy measured by a new quantity
\emph{lossy-equivocation}, which is proven to be the minimum optimistic
1-achievable source coding rate (the minimum coding rate needed to reconstruct
the source within target distortion with positive probability for
\emph{infinitely many blocklengths}) of the source with the wiretapped signal
as two-sided information, and also can be seen as a lossy extension of
conventional equivocation. Upon this (or list) secrecy measure, we study
source-channel secrecy problem in the discrete memoryless Shannon cipher system
with \emph{noisy} wiretap channel. Two inner bounds and an outer bound on the
achievable region of secret key rate, list rate, wiretapper distortion, and
distortion of legitimate user are given. The inner bounds are derived by using
uncoded scheme and (operationally) separate scheme, respectively. Thanks to the
equivalence between lossy-equivocation secrecy and list secrecy, information
spectrum method is leveraged to prove the outer bound. As special cases, the
admissible region for the case of degraded wiretap channel or lossless
communication for legitimate user has been characterized completely. For both
these two cases, separate scheme is proven to be optimal. Interestingly,
however, separation indeed suffers performance loss for other certain cases.
Besides, we also extend our results to characterize the achievable region for

as metagenomic data analysis. The observed data lie in a high-dimensional
simplex, and conventional statistical methods often fail to produce sensible
results due to the unit-sum constraint. In this article, we address the problem
of covariance estimation for high-dimensional compositional data, and introduce
a composition-adjusted thresholding (COAT) method under the assumption that the
basis covariance matrix is sparse. Our method is based on a decomposition
relating the compositional covariance to the basis covariance, which is
approximately identifiable as the dimensionality tends to infinity. The
resulting procedure can be viewed as thresholding the sample centered log-ratio
covariance matrix and hence is scalable for large covariance matrices. We
rigorously characterize the identifiability of the covariance parameters,
derive rates of convergence under the spectral norm, and provide theoretical
guarantees on support recovery. Simulation studies demonstrate that the COAT
estimator outperforms some naive thresholding estimators that ignore the unique
features of compositional data. We apply the proposed method to the analysis of
a microbiome dataset in order to understand the dependence structure among
bacterial taxa in the human gut.

entanglement, even if one party's measurements are untrusted. This concept has
not only provided new insights into the nature of non-local spatial
correlations in quantum mechanics, but also serves as a resource for one-sided
device-independent quantum information tasks. Here, we investigate how EPR
steering behaves when one-half of a maximally-entangled pair of qudits
(multidimensional quantum systems) is cloned by a universal cloning machine. We
find that EPR steering, as verified by a criterion based on the mutual
information between qudits, can only be found in one of the copy subsystems but
not both. We prove that this is also true for the single-system analogue of EPR
steering. We find that this restriction, which we term ""no-cloning of quantum
steering"", elucidates the physical reason why steering can be used to secure
sources and channels against cloning-based attacks when implementing quantum
communication and quantum computation protocols.

a semi-analytic method based on $N$-body simulations, we estimate the effect of
possible magnification perturbation caused by subhaloes with a mass scale of
<$\sim 10^9\,h^{-1} \textrm{M}_\odot$ in lensing galaxy haloes. Taking into
account astrometric shifts, assuming that the primary lens is described by a
singular isothermal ellipsoid, the expected change to the flux ratios per a
multiply lensed image is just a few percent and the mean of the expected
convergence perturbation at the effective Einstein radius of the lensing galaxy
halo is $ 0.003$, corresponding to the mean of the ratio of a projected dark
matter mass fraction in subhaloes at the effective Einstein radius $0.006$. In
contrast, the expected change to the flux ratio caused by line-of-sight
structures is typically $\sim 10$ percent and the mean of the convergence
perturbation is $0.008$, corresponding to $0.017$. The contribution of
magnification perturbation caused by subhaloes is $\sim 40$ percent of the
total at a source redshift $z_S= 0.7$ and decreases monotonically in $z_S$ to
$\sim 20$ percent at $z_S= 3.6$. Assuming statistical isotropy, the convergence
perturbation estimated from observed 11 quadruple lens systems has a positive
correlation with the source redshift $z_S$, which is much stronger than that
with the lens redshift $z_L$. This feature also supports an idea that the flux
ratio anomaly is caused mainly by line-of-sight structures rather than
subhaloes. We also discuss about a possible imprint of line-of-sight structures
in demagnification of minimum images due to locally underdense structures in

ratio and eccentricity. A present possible scenario for the system is that both
of the planets have nearly circular orbits, namely the eccentricity of the
outer planet is less than ~0.15, which is just within 1.4sigma of the best-fit
value, or the planets are in a mutually retrograde configuration with a mutual
orbital inclination larger than 160 degree.

suggesting that the observed asymmetry is consistent also in datasets annotated
in a fully automatic process, and without human intervention. That shows that
the photometric data collected by SDSS is sensitive to the handedness of the
galaxy. Also, analysis of the number of galaxies classified as clockwise and
counterclockwise by crowdsourcing shows that manual classification between
spiral and elliptical galaxies can be affected by the handedness of the galaxy,

strength of Ramsey's theorem and its consequences. For this, we use the
frameworks of reverse mathematics and of computable reducibility. We proceed to
a systematic study of various Ramsey-type statements under a unified and
minimalistic framework and obtain a precise analysis of their interrelations.
We clarify the role of the number of colors in Ramsey's theorem. In particular,
we show that the hierarchy of Ramsey's theorem induced by the number of colors
is strictly increasing over computable reducibility, and exhibit in reverse
mathematics an infinite decreasing hiearchy of Ramsey-type theorems by
weakening the homogeneity constraints. These results tend to show that the
Ramsey-type statements are not robust, that is, slight variations of the
statements lead to strictly different subsystems. Finally, we pursuit the
analysis of the links between Ramsey's theorems and compacity arguments, by
extending Liu's theorem to several Ramsey-type statements and by proving its
optimality under various aspects.

spaces with $p\in [1,2)$ and $p$-powers of the corresponding norms are
appropriate settings for dealing with reconstruction of sparse solutions of
ill-posed problems by regularization. It seems that the case $p=1$ provides the
best results in most of the situations compared to the cases $p\in (1,2)$. An
extensive literature gives great credit also to using $\ell^p$ spaces with
$p\in (0,1)$ together with the corresponding quasinorms, although one has to
tackle challenging numerical problems raised by the non-convexity of the
quasi-norms. In any of these settings, either super, linear or sublinear, the
question of how to choose the exponent $p$ has been not only a numerical issue,
but also a philosophical one. In this work we introduce a more flexible way of
sparse regularization by varying exponents. We introduce the corresponding
functional analytic framework, that leaves the setting of normed spaces but
works with so-called F-norms. One curious result is that there are F-norms
which generate the $\ell^1$ space, but they are strictly convex, while the
$\ell^1$-norm is just convex.

particularly attractive model system to study the global phase diagram of

rest-frame 1-20 microns continuum emission from the torus which we model here
with the clumpy torus models of Nenkova et al. Optically classified type 1 and
type 2 AGN are intrinsically different, with type 2 AGN having on average tori

tori with large covering factors while ~23-28 per cent of type 2 AGN have tori
with small covering factors. Low f2 are preferred at high AGN luminosities, as
postulated by simple receding torus models, although for type 2 AGN the effect
is certainly small. f2 increases with the X-ray column density, which implies
that dust extinction an X-ray absorption takes place in material that shares an
overall geometry and most likely belongs to the same structure, the putative
torus. Based on our results, the viewing angle, AGN luminosity and also f2
determine the optical appearance of an AGN and control the shape of the

geometrical covering factor is a key ingredient of unification schemes.

spin-dependent or spin-independent scattering of dark matter particles.
However, especially in models with light dark matter particles
$\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{GeV/c^2})$, operators which carry additional powers of the
momentum transfer $q^2$ can become dominant. One such model based on asymmetric
dark matter has been invoked to overcome discrepancies in helioseismology and
an indication was found for a particle with preferred mass of 3
$\mathrm{GeV/c^2}$ and cross section of $10^{-37} \mathrm{cm^2}$. Recent data
from the CRESST-II experiment, which uses cryogenic detectors based on
$\mathrm{CaWO_4}$ to search for nuclear recoils induced by dark matter
particles, are used to constrain these momentum-dependent models. The low

nodes, receiving individual data streams, are connected to a designated server.
The server is asked to continuously monitor a function defined over the values
observed across all streams while minimizing the communication. We study a
variant in which the server is equipped with a broadcast channel and is
supposed to keep track of an approximation of the set of nodes currently
observing the $k$ largest values. Such an approximate set is exact except for
some imprecision in an $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of the $k$-th largest value.
This approximation of the Top-$k$-Position Monitoring Problem is of interest in
cases where marginal changes (e.g. due to noise) in observed values can be
ignored so that monitoring an approximation is sufficient and can reduce
communication.
  This paper extends our results from [IPDPS'15], where we have developed a
filter-based online algorithm for the (exact) Top-k-Position Monitoring
Problem. There we have presented a competitive analysis of our algorithm
against an offline adversary that also is restricted to filter-based
algorithms. Our new algorithms as well as their analyses use new methods. We
analyze their competitiveness against adversaries that use both exact and
approximate filter-based algorithms, and observe severe differences between the
respective powers of these adversaries.

of heavy quark at the critical temperature is hadronization. It is found that
the hadronization time of heavy quark is about 3 fm/c for $2\pi T_c D_s=6$, if
a heavy quark is combined with the nearest light antiquark in coordinate space
without any correlation between momentum of heavy quark and that of light
antiquark which form a heavy meson. However, the hadronization time reduces to
0.6-1.2 fm/c for charm and 0.4-0.9 fm/c for bottom, depending on heavy meson
radius, in the presence of momentum correlation. Considering the interspace
between quarks and antiquarks at the critical temperature, it seems that the
hadronization of heavy quark does not happen instantaneously but gradually for
a considerable time, if started from the thermal distribution of quarks and
antiquarks.

sensitive to the phase stability of the VLBI array. This is especially
important when we reach {\mu}Jy r.m.s. sensitivities. Calibration using
standard phase referencing techniques is often used to improve the phase
stability of VLBI data but the results are often not optimal. This is evident
in blank fields that do not have in-beam calibrators. Aims. We present a
calibration algorithm termed Multi-Source Self-Calibration (MSSC) which can be
used after standard phase referencing on wide-field VLBI observations. This is
tested on a 1.6 GHz wide-field VLBI data set of the Hubble Deep Field-North and
the Hubble Flanking Fields. Methods. MSSC uses multiple target sources detected
in the field via standard phase referencing techniques and modifies the
visibili- ties so that each data set approximates to a point source. These are
combined to increase the signal to noise and permit self-calibration. In
principle, this should allow residual phase changes caused by the troposphere
and ionosphere to be corrected. By means of faceting, the technique can also be
used for direction dependent calibration. Results. Phase corrections, derived
using MSSC, were applied to a wide-field VLBI data set of the HDF-N comprising
of 699 phase centres. MSSC was found to perform considerably better than
standard phase referencing and single source self-calibration. All detected
sources exhibited dramatic improvements in dynamic range. Using MSSC, one
source reached the detection threshold taking the total detected sources to
twenty. 60% of these sources can now be imaged with uniform weighting compared
to just 45% with standard phase referencing. The Parseltongue code which
implements MSSC has been released and made publicly available to the
astronomical community (https://github.com/jradcliffe5/multi_self_cal).

Biology. As most commonly only some of the kinetic parameters are measurable or
precisely known, parameter estimation techniques are applied to parametrize the
model to experimental data. A main challenge for the parameter estimation is
the complexity of the parameter space, especially its high dimensionality and
local minima.
  Parameter estimation techniques consist of an objective function, measuring
how well a certain parameter set describes the experimental data, and an
optimization algorithm that optimizes this objective function. A lot of effort
has been spent on developing highly sophisticated optimization algorithms to
cope with the complexity in the parameter space, but surprisingly few articles
address the influence of the objective function on the computational complexity
in finding global optima. We extend a recently developed multiple shooting for
stochastic systems (MSS) objective function for parameter estimation of
stochastic models and apply it to parameter estimation of ODE models. This MSS
objective function treats the intervals between measurement points separately.
This separate treatment allows the ODE trajectory to stay closer to the data
and we show that it reduces the complexity of the parameter space.
  We use examples from Systems Biology, namely a Lotka-Volterra model, a
FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator and a Calcium oscillation model, to demonstrate the
power of the MSS approach for reducing the complexity and the number of local
minima in the parameter space. The approach is fully implemented in the COPASI
software package and, therefore, easily accessible for a wide community of
researchers.

of parameters in the quark mass matrices needed for the successful CKM mixing
and CP violation. We impose three zeros in the down-quark mass matrix with
taking the diagonal up-quark mass matrix to reduce the number of free
parameters. The three zeros are maximal zeros in order to have a CP violating
phase in the quark mass matrix. Then, there remain six real parameters and one
CP violating phase, which is the minimal number to reproduce the observed data
of the down-quark masses and the CKM parameters. The twenty textures with three
zeros are examined. Among them, the thirteen textures are viable for the
down-quark mass matrix. As a representative of these textures, we discuss a
texture $M_d^{(1)}$ in details. By using the experimental data on $\sin
2\beta$, $\theta_{13}$ and $\theta_{23}$ together with the observed quark
masses, the Cabibbo angle is predicted to be close to the experimental data. It
is found that this surprising result remains unchanged in all other viable
textures. We also investigate the correlations among $|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|$, $\sin
2\beta$ and $J_{CP}$. For all textures, the maximal value of the ratio
$|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|$ is $0.09$, which is smaller than the upper-bound of the
experimental data, $0.094$. We hope that this prediction will be tested in
future experiments.

magnetic field of $B$~100$\mu$G is needed to represent the measured data.
Although this is comparable to formerly published estimates, a standard
E$^{-2}$ spectrum for the proton distribution cannot describe the gamma-ray

implies that ~$7\times 10^{49}/n_{cm^{-3}}$erg has been transferred into
high-energy protons with the effective density $n_{cm^{-3}}=n/ 1$ cm^-3. This
is about 10\% of the kinetic energy of a typical Type Ia supernova under the

Yet experimental observations are often limited to a small subset of variables
that participate in energy transport and dissipation. Here we show, through a
solvable Langevin model, that the seemingly hidden entropy production is
measurable through the violation spectrum of the fluctuation-response relation
of a slow observable. For general Markov systems with timescale separation, we
prove that the violation spectrum exhibits a characteristic plateau in the
intermediate frequency region. Despite its vanishing height, the plateau can
account for energy dissipation over a broad timescale. Our findings suggest a
general possibility to probe hidden entropy production in nano systems without
direct observation of fast variables.

transposition exchanges adjacent sublists; when one of the sublists is

transposition. We call the operations: transpositions, prefix transpositions

particular block-move are closely related. In this article we compute the
cardinalities of P$_{n}$(k) i.e. $ \forall_k \mid $P$ _{n} $ (k) $ \mid $ for

expected number of moves to sort a permutation in P$_{n} $ are closely related.

this way, both the diffusion and drift motion of charge carriers are described
in a unified framework. Based on an off-diagonal electron-phonon coupling model

localization, and a negative electric-field dependence of mobility is observed.
The Einstein relation, which is a manifestation of the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem, is found to be restored in electric fields up to ~$10^5$ V/cm for a

state implies that the original state is entangled. This generalizes a result
obtained for continuous-variable systems to the discrete-variable-system case.
This is significant because testing entanglement in terms of an uncertainty
relation has a physically appealing interpretation. We study the case of a
Werner state, which is a mixed state constructed as a convex combination with a
parameter $r$ of a Bell state $|\Phi^{+} \rangle$ and the completely incoherent

basic ones in mathematical genetics. By using Markov chain theory and
stochastic compositions, we explain probabilistically a theorem due to Kelisky

substrates (graphene, few-layers graphene, graphite and platinum). Our results
also show that the observed hydrogenation rates are very sensitive to the

hydrogenated carbon atoms was for platinum substrates. Our results also show
that a significant number of randomly distributed H clusters are formed during
the early stages of the hydrogenation process, regardless of the type of

formation, large perfect graphone-like domains are unlikely to be formed. These
findings are especially important since experiments have showed that cluster
formation influences the electronic transport properties in hydrogenated
graphene.

MHz and carried out at the Green Bank Telescope and the Arecibo Observatory.
The ~800-MHz wide frequency bands imply dramatic changes in scintillation
bandwidth across the bandpass, and a stretching routine has been included to
account for this scaling. For most of the 10 pulsars for which the scaling has
been measured, the bandwidths scale with frequency less steeply than expected
for a Kolmogorov medium. We find estimated scattering delay values that vary
with time by up to an order of magnitude. The mean measured scattering delays
are similar to previously published values and slightly higher than predicted
by interstellar medium models. We investigate the possibility of increasing the
timing precision by mitigating timing errors introduced by the scattering
delays. For most of the pulsars, the uncertainty in the time of arrival of a
single timing point is much larger than the maximum variation of the scattering

arrangement of internal organs is asymmetric. In zebrafish, the breaking of
left-right symmetry is organised by Kupffer's Vesicle (KV): an approximately
spherical, fluid-filled structure that begins to form in the embryo 10 hours
post fertilisation. A crucial component of zebrafish symmetry breaking is the
establishment of a cilia-driven fluid flow within KV. However, it is still
unclear (a) how dorsal, ventral and equatorial cilia contribute to the global
vortical flow, and (b) if this flow breaks left-right symmetry through
mechanical transduction or morphogen transport. Fully answering these questions
requires knowledge of the three-dimensional flow patterns within KV, which have
not been quantified in previous work. In this study, we calculate and analyse
the three-dimensional flow in KV. We consider flow from both individual and
groups of cilia, and (a) find anticlockwise flow can arise purely from excess
of cilia on the dorsal roof over the ventral floor, showing how this vortical
flow is stabilised by dorsal tilt of equatorial cilia, and (b) show that
anterior clustering of dorsal cilia leads to around 40% faster flow in the
anterior over the posterior corner. We argue that these flow features are
supportive of symmetry breaking through mechano-sensory cilia, and suggest a
novel experiment to test this hypothesis. From our new understanding of the
flow, we propose a further experiment to reverse the flow within KV to
potentially induce situs inversus.

Previous publications showed a large variety of conventional algorithms adapted

radiation, i.e. refraction at interfaces, reflection losses and the beam
profile (Gaussian beam), which results in poor reconstructions. The aim is the
efficient reconstruction of the complex refractive index, since it indicates
inhomogeneities in the material. A hybrid algorithm has been developed based on
the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART). ART is adapted by including
refraction (Snell's law) and reflection losses (Fresnel equations). Our method
uses a priori information about the interface and layer geometry of the sample.
This results in the 'Modified ART for THz tomography', which reconstructs
simultaneously the complex refractive index from transmission coefficient and
travel time measurements.

expressions for the second-order coding region and the moderate deviations

new insights on the second-order behavior compared to the scenario where

describe a DMS, for which the optimal second-order region transitions from
being characterizable by a bivariate Gaussian to a univariate Gaussian, as the
distortion levels are varied. We then consider a GMS with quadratic distortion

is encountered in the presence of a wiretapper, who has capability of accessing
an unknown channel-subset in communication networks. In order to combat this
eavesdropping attack, secure network coding is introduced to prevent
information from being leaked to adversaries. For any construction of secure
linear network codes (SLNCs) over a wiretap network, the based field size is a
very important index, because it largely determines the computational and space
complexities, and further the efficiency of network transmission. Further, it
is also very important for the process of secure network coding from
theoretical research to practical applications. In the present paper, we
proposed new lower bounds on the field size for constructing SLNCs, which shows
that the field size can be reduced considerably without giving up any security
and capacity. In addition, since the obtained lower bounds depend on network
topology, how to efficiently determine them is another very important and
attractive problem for explicit constructions of SLNCs. Motivated by a desire
to develop methods with low complexity and empirical behavior to solve this
problem, we propose efficient approaches and present a series of algorithms for
implementation. Subsequently, the complexity of our algorithms is analyzed,
which shows that they are polynomial-time.

common scenarios, such as efficient updates of a large, encrypted, or

a coding approach. The former approach boils down to presenting large sets of
permutations with \textit{locality}, that is, any symbol of the permutation can
be computed from a small set of other symbols. In the latter approach, a
permutation may be coded in order to achieve locality. This paper focuses on
the combinatorial approach.
  We provide upper and lower bounds for the maximal size of a set of
permutations with locality, and provide several simple constructions which
attain the upper bound. In cases where the upper bound is not attained, we
provide alternative constructions using Reed-Solomon codes, permutation

numerous interesting predictions, including: non-locality, generalization of

occupation number, shifting of the vacuum energy and renormalization of the
charge and speed of propagation of field excitations. Furthermore, a compact
field space is a natural way to implement the ""Principle of Finiteness"" of
physical theories, which once motivated the Born-Infeld theory. Thus the
presented framework has a variety of potential applications in the theories of

The main-sequence B-type star $\zeta$ Cassiopeiae is known as a N-rich
star with a magnetic field discovered with the Musicos spectropolarimeter. We
model the magnetic field of the star by means of 82 new spectropolarimetric
observations of higher precision to investigate the field strength, topology,
and effect.
  Methods. We gathered data with the Narval spectropolarimeter installed at
T\'elescope Bernard Lyot (TBL, Pic du Midi, France) and applied the
least-squares deconvolution technique to measure the circular polarisation of
the light emitted from $\zeta$ Cas. We used a dipole oblique rotator model to
determine the field configuration by fitting the longitudinal field
measurements and by synthesizing the measured Stokes V profiles. We also made
use of the Zeeman-Doppler Imaging technique to map the stellar surface and to
deduce the difference in rotation rate between the pole and equator.
  Results. $\zeta$ Cas exhibits a polar field strength $B_{\rm pol}$ of 100-150
G, which is the weakest polar field observed so far in a massive main-sequence
star. Surface differential rotation is ruled out by our observations and the
field of $\zeta$ Cas is strong enough to enforce rigid internal rotation in the
radiative zone according to theory. Thus, the star rotates as a solid body in
the envelope.
  Conclusions. We therefore exclude rotationally-induced mixing as the cause of
the surface N-enrichment. We discuss that the transport of chemicals from the
core to the surface by internal gravity waves is the most plausible explanation
for the nitrogen overabundance at the surface of $\zeta$ Cas.

SDSS-J102915+172927 is of fundamental importance to improve our knowledge on
the transition between the first and second generation of stars in the
Universe. In this paper, we perform three-dimensional cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations of dust-enriched halos during the early stages of
the collapse process including a detailed treatment of the dust physics. We
employ the astrochemistry package \krome coupled with the hydrodynamical code
\textsc{enzo} assuming grain size distributions produced by the explosion of
core-collapse supernovae of 20 and 35 M$_\odot$ primordial stars which are
suitable to reproduce the chemical pattern of the SDSS-J102915+172927 star. We
find that the dust mass yield produced from Population III supernovae
explosions is the most important factor which drives the thermal evolution and
the dynamical properties of the halos. Hence, for the specific distributions
relevant in this context, the composition, the dust optical properties, and the
size-range have only minor effects on the results due to similar cooling
functions. We also show that the critical dust mass to enable fragmentation
provided by semi-analytical models should be revised, as we obtain values one
order of magnitude larger. This determines the transition from disk
fragmentation to a more filamentary fragmentation mode, and suggests that
likely more than one single supernova event or efficient dust growth should be
invoked to get such a high dust content.

Gruenbaum from 1970 by constructing higher order Dehn-Sommerville valuations

valuation is the Wu characteristic w(G) which sums (-1)^(dim(x)+dim(y)) over
all intersecting pairs of complete subgraphs x,y of a G. More generally, an
intersection number w(A,B) sums (-1)^(dim(x)+dim(y)) over pairs x,y, where x is
in A and y is in B and x,y intersect. w(G) is a quadratic Euler characteristic
X(G), where X sums (-1)^dim(x) over all complete subgraphs x of G. We prove
that w is multiplicative, like Euler characteristic: w(G x H) = w(G) w(H) for
any two graphs and that w is invariant under Barycentric refinements. We
construct a curvature K satisfying Gauss-Bonnet w(G) = sum K(a). We also prove
w(G) = X(G)-X(dG) for Euler characteristic X which holds for any d-graph G with
boundary dG. We also show higher order Poincare-Hopf formulas: there is for
every multi-linear valuation X and function f an index i(a) such that sum
i(a)=X(G). For d-graphs G and X=w it agrees with the Euler curvature. For the
vanishing multi-valuations which were conjectured to exist, like for the
quadratic valuation X(G) = (V X) Y with X=(1,-1,1,-1,1),Y=(0,-2,3,-4,5) on
4-graphs, discrete 4 manifolds, where V_{ij}(G) is the f-matrix counting the
number of i and j-simplices in G intersecting, the curvature is constant zero.
For all graphs and multi-linear Dehn-Sommerville relations, the
Dehn-Sommerville curvature K(v) at a vertex is a Dehn-Sommerville valuation on
the unit sphere S(v). We show X V(G) Y = v(G) Y for any linear valuation Y of a

lowers the direct-current (DC) electrical conductivity of low density Al,
yielding improved agreement with experiment. The greatest lowering is about
15\% for T= 15 kK. Correspondingly, the KS band structure of low-density fcc Al

Deuterium equations of state obtained from the two XC functionals exhibit
pressure differences as large as 4\% and a 6\% range of differences. However,
the Hydrogen principal Hugoniot is insensitive to explicit XC $T$-dependence
because of cancellation between the energy and pressure-volume work difference

feasibility of using time-dependent density-functional theory as a means to
implement, theoretically, this absorption-optimization idea, for more complex

an X-ray outburst from the black hole transient V404 Cyg. We monitored V404 Cyg
for the last 10 years with the 2-m Faulkes Telescope North in three optical
bands (V, R, and i$^{'}$). We found that, one week prior to this outburst, the
optical flux was 0.1--0.3 mag brighter than the quiescent orbital modulation,
implying an optical precursor to the X-ray outburst. There is also a hint of a
gradual optical decay (years) followed by a rise lasting two months prior to
the outburst. We fortuitously obtained an optical spectrum of V404 Cyg 13 hours
before the BAT trigger. This too was brighter ($\sim1\rm\,mag$) than
quiescence, and showed spectral lines typical of an accretion disk, with
characteristic absorption features of the donor being much weaker. No He II
emission was detected, which would have been expected had the X-ray flux been
substantially brightening. This, combined with the presence of intense
H$\alpha$ emission, about 7 times the quiescent level, suggests that the disk
entered the hot, outburst state before the X-ray outburst began. We propose
that the outburst is produced by a viscous-thermal instability triggered close
to the inner edge of a truncated disk. An X-ray delay of a week is consistent
with the time needed to refill the inner region and hence move the inner edge
of the disk inwards, allowing matter to reach the central BH, finally turning
on the X-ray emission.

K is multiplicative if GxH -> K implies G -> K or H -> K, for all graphs G,H.
Here GxH is the tensor (or categorical) graph product and G -> K denotes the
existence of a graph homomorphism from G to K. Hedetniemi's conjecture states
that all cliques K_n are multiplicative. However, the only non-trivial graphs
known to be multiplicative are K_3, odd cycles, and still more generally,
circular cliques $K_{p/q}$ with 2 <= p/q < 4. We make no progress for cliques,
but show that all square-free graphs are multiplicative. In particular, this
gives the first multiplicative graphs of chromatic number higher than 4.
Generalizing, in terms of the box complex, the topological insight behind
existing proofs for odd cycles, we also give a different proof for circular
cliques.

role in basic electric circuit theory, seems to be tackled without the needful

to linear networks containing linear dependent sources still appears as an
addressed point unworthy to be further discussed. Conversely, the analysis of
this point has been recently re-proposed [5,6] and an alternative conclusion
has been drawn. From this result, the manuscript provides an alternative
approach to such issue from a more general point of view. It is oriented to
clarify the issue from the didactic viewpoint, rather than provide a more
efficient general technique for circuit analysis. By starting from a linear
system of equations, representing a general linear circuit containing
controlled sources, the correct interpretation of turning off the controlled
elements in terms of circuit equivalent is provided, so allowing a statement of
the POS for linear circuits in a wider context. Further, this approach is
sufficiently intuitive and straightforward to fit the needs of a Basic Electric

phenomenological pion-nucleon $(\pi N)$ Lagrangian. For our purpose, we have
calculated the results up to one loop order in self energy diagrams with the
pseudoscalar $(PS)$ and pseudovector $(PV)$ pion-nucleon interactions. By
assuming weak external magnetic field it is seen that the effective mass of
pion gets explicit magnetic field dependence and it is modified significantly
for the case of PS coupling. However, for the PV coupling, only a modest
increase in the effective mass is observed. These modified dispersion relations
due to the presence of the external field can have substantial influence in the

Energy Neutron Detector Array (LENDA). LENDA is an array of 24 BC-408
plastic-scintillator bars designed to measure low-energy neutrons with kinetic
energies in the range of 100 keV to 10 MeV from (p,n)-type charge-exchange
reactions. Compared to the previous data acquisition (DAQ) system for LENDA,
DDAS offers the possibility to lower the neutron detection threshold, increase
the overall neutron-detection efficiency, decrease the dead time of the system,
and allow for easy expansion of the array. The system utilized in this work was
XIA's Digital Gamma Finder Pixie-16 250 MHz digitizers. A detector-limited
timing resolution of 400 ps was achieved for a single LENDA bar. Using DDAS,
the neutron detection threshold of the system was reduced compared to the
previous analog system, now reaching below 100 keV. The new DAQ system was
successfully used in a recent charge-exchange experiment using the
$^{16}$C(p,n) reaction at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory
(NSCL).

based on optical transitions approach uncertainties of $10^{-18}$, where full
frequency descriptions are far beyond the reach of the SI second. Frequency
ratios of such super clocks, on the other hand, are not subject to this
limitation. They can therefore verify consistency and overall accuracy for an
ensemble of super clocks, an essential step towards a redefinition of the
second. However, with the measurement stabilities so far reported for such
frequency ratios, a confirmation to $1 \times 10^{-18}$ uncertainty would
require an averaging time $\tau$ of multiple months. Here we report a
measurement of the frequency ratio of neutral ytterbium and strontium clocks
with a much improved stability of $4 \times 10^{-16} ({\tau}/s)^{-1/2}$.
Enabled by the high stability of optical lattice clocks interrogating hundreds
of atoms, this marks a 90-fold reduction in the required averaging time over a
previous record-setting experiment that determined the ratio of Al+ and Hg+
single-ion clocks to an uncertainty of $5.2 \times 10^{-17}$. For the Yb/Sr

interfaces and grain boundary networks in polycrystalline materials. Each type
of topological feature is treated in order of rank in the hierarchy, with the
lower-level feature being filtered subject to the positional constraints
imposed by the higher-level features. Such a scheme is an alternative to
existing surface smoothing/estimation techniques in microstructural materials
science, in which the explicit treatment of different elements of the network
topology is absent, or at best arbitrarily parameterized. We describe the
ramifications of this technique in the usual microstructural applications in
which the computation of important physical quantities is predicated on the

describe a novel front-tracking algorithm for quantifying the transport of such

layered materials, accurate determination of the stacking order is important
for studying the basic properties of these materials as well as for device
applications. Because 2H-molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is most common in nature,
most studies so far have focused on 2H-MoS2. However, we found that the 2H, 3R,
and mixed stacking sequences exist in few-layer MoS2 exfoliated from natural
molybdenite crystals. The crystal structures are confirmed by HR-TEM
measurements. The Raman signatures of different polytypes are investigated by
using 3 different excitation energies which are non-resonant and resonant with
A and C excitons, respectively. The low-frequency breathing and shear modes
show distinct differences for each polytype whereas the high-frequency
intra-layer modes show little difference. For resonant excitations at 1.96 and
2.81 eV, distinct features are observed which enable determination of the
stacking order.

(BH) with charge to mass ratio $q$ is metric solution of Born-Infeld nonlinear
Maxwell-Einstein theory. Central region of the BH behaves as (anti-) de Sitter
for $(|q|>1)~|q|<1 .$ In case of $|q|=1$ the BH central region behaves as
Minkowski flat metric. Nonlinear Electromagnetic (NEM) fields counterpart
causes to deviate light geodesics and so light rays will forced to move on
effective metric. In this paper we study weak and strong gravitational lensing
of light rays by seeking affects of NEM fields counterpart on image locations
and corresponding magnification. We set our calculations to experimentally
observed Sgr A$^*$ BH. In short we obtained: For large distances the NEM
counterpart is negligible reaching to linear Maxwell fields. The NEM makes
enlarge the BH photon sphere radius as linearly by raising $|q|>1$ but deceases
by raising $|q|\leq1.$ Sign of deflection angle of bending light rays is
changed in presence of NEM effects with respect to ones obtained in absence of
NEM fields. Absolute value of deflection angle raises by increasing $|q|\to1.$
Weak image locations decreases (increases) by raising $0<|q|<1$ in presence
(absence) of NEM fields. By raising the closest distance of the bending light
rays weak image locations changes from left (right) to right (left) in absence
(presence) of NEM fields. Einstein rings radius and corresponding Magnification
centroid become larger (smaller) in presence (absence) of NEM fields in case of
weak lensing. Angular separation $s$ between the innermost and outermost
relativistic images increases (decreases) by increasing $0<|q|<1$ in absence
(presence) of NEM fields. Corresponding magnification $r$ decreases (increases)
by raising $0<|q|<1$ in absence (presence) of NEM fields. $s (r)$ raises
(decreases) by increasing $|q|>>1.$

makes customer retention an important factor for any company to survive. Thus,
many methodologies (e.g., data mining and statistics) have been proposed to
analyse and study customer retention. The validity of such methods is not yet
proved though. This paper tries to fill this gap by empirically comparing two
techniques: Customer churn-decision tree and logistic regression models. The
paper proves the superiority of decision tree technique and stresses the needs
for more advanced methods to churn modelling.
