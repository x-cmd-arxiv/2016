transport equations based on certain stable variational formulations of
Petrov-Galerkin type. The variational formulations allow us to employ meshes
with cells of arbitrary aspect ratios. We develop a refinement scheme
generating highly anisotropic partitions that is inspired by shearlet systems.
We establish approximation rates for N-term approximations from corresponding
piecewise polynomials for certain compact cartoon classes of functions. In
contrast to earlier results in a curvelet or shearlet context the cartoon
classes are concisely defined through certain characteristic parameters and the
dependence of the approximation rates on these parameters is made explicit
here. The approximation rate results serve then as a benchmark for subsequent
applications to adaptive Galerkin solvers for transport equations. In numerical
experiments, the new algorithms track C^2-curved shear layers and
discontinuities stably and accurately, and realize essentially optimal rates.
Finally, we treat parameter dependent transport problems, which arise in
kinetic models as well as in radiative transfer. In heterogeneous media these
problems feature propagation of singularities along curved characteristics
precluding, in particular, fast marching methods based on ray-tracing. Since
now the solutions are functions of spatial variables and parameters one has to
address the curse of dimensionality. We show computationally, for a model
parametric transport problem in heterogeneous media in 2 + 1 dimension, that

scheme with hierarchic collocation in ordinate space based on a stable
variational formulation high-dimensional phase space, the curse of

the finding that the H$\alpha$/FUV flux ratio of galaxies systematically
declines as global galactic properties such as the star formation rate and
stellar mass decrease. The three dwarf galaxies selected for study have star
formation rates, that when calculated from their H$\alpha$ luminosities using
standard conversion recipes, are $\sim$50\% of those based on the FUV.
Follow-up studies of many of the potential causes for the trends in the
H$\alpha$/FUV flux ratio have been performed, but the possibility that previous
observations have missed a non-negligible fraction of faint ionized emission in
dwarf galaxies has not been investigated. The MMTF observations reveal both
diffuse and structured H$\alpha$ emission (filaments, shells, possible
single-star HII regions) spanning extents up to 2.5 times larger relative to
previous observations. However, only up to an additional $\sim5$\% of H$\alpha$
flux is captured, which does not account for the trends in the H$\alpha$/FUV
ratio. Beyond investigation of the H$\alpha$/FUV ratio, the impact of the newly
detected extended flux on our understanding of star formation, the properties

incidents is bounded. A necessary condition is that the demand must not exceed
the time-average capacity adjusted for spillback. A sufficient condition, in
the form of a set of bilinear inequalities, is also established by constructing
a Lyapunov function and applying the classical Foster-Lyapunov drift condition.
Both conditions can be easily verified for realistic instances of the
stochastic incident model. Our analysis relies on the construction of a
globally attracting invariant set, and exploits the properties of the traffic
flow dynamics. We use our results to analyze the impact of stochastic capacity
fluctuation (frequency, intensity, and spatial correlation) on the throughput
of a freeway segment.

Evolution Explorer (GALEX) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to ensure
that regions of comparable size in each galaxy are being analyzed. We follow
the method of Calzetti et al. (1994) and characterize the dust attenuation
through the UV power-law index, $\beta$, and the dust optical depth, which is
quantified using the difference in Balmer emission line optical depth,
$\tau_B^l=\tau_{\mathrm{H}\beta} - \tau_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}$. The observed
linear relationship between $\beta$ and $\tau_B^l$ is similar to the local
starburst relation, but the large scatter ($\sigma_{\mathrm{int}}=0.44$)
suggests there is significant variation in the local Universe. We derive a
selective attenuation curve over the range
$1250\mathrm{\AA}<\lambda<8320\mathrm{\AA}$ and find that a single attenuation
curve is effective for characterizing the majority of galaxies in our sample.
This curve has a slightly lower selective attenuation in the UV compared to
previously determined curves. We do not see evidence to suggest that a 2175\AA\
feature is significant in the average attenuation curve. Significant positive
correlations are seen between the amount of UV and optical reddening and galaxy
metallicity, mass, star formation rate (SFR), and SFR surface density. This
provides a potential tool for gauging attenuation where the stellar population

to intrinsic disc variations or reprocessing of X-ray emission by a surrounding
accretion disc, has been a puzzle for many years. However recently a number of
observational programmes, particularly of NGC5548 with Swift, have shown that
the UV/optical variations lag behind the X-ray variations in a manner strongly
supportive of X-ray reprocessing. Somewhat surprisingly the implied size of the
accretion disc is ~3x greater than expected from a standard, smooth,
Shakura-Sunyaev thin disc model. Although the difference may be explained by a
clumpy accretion disc, it is not clear whether the difference will occur in all
AGN or whether it may change as, eg, a function of black hole mass, accretion
rate or disc temperature. Measurements of interband lags for most AGN require
long timescale monitoring, which is hard to arrange. However for low mass (<1
million solar mass) AGN, the combination of XMM-Newton EPIC (X-rays) with the
optical monitor in fast readout mode allows an X-ray/UV-optical lag to be
measured within a single long observation. Here we summarise previous related
observations and report on XMM-Newton observations of NGC4395 (mass ~100x lower
and accretion rate ~20x lower than for NGC5548). We find that the UVW1 lags the
X-rays by ~470s. Simultaneous observations at 6 different ground based
observatories also allowed the g-band lag (~800s) to be measured. These
observations are in agreement with X-ray reprocessing but initial analysis
suggests that, for NGC4395, they do not differ markedly from the predictions of
the standard thin disc model.

Various studies indicate that interacting binary stars of Algol type
evolve non-conservatively. However, direct detections of systemic mass loss in
Algols have been scarce so far. We study the systemic mass loss in Algols by
looking for the presence of infrared excesses originating from the thermal
emission of dust grains, which is linked to the presence of a stellar wind.
  Methods. In contrast to previous studies, we make use of the fact that
stellar and interstellar material is piled up at the edge of the astrosphere
where the stellar wind interacts with the interstellar medium. We analyse WISE
W3 $12\,\mu$m and WISE W4 $22\,\mu$m data of Algol-type binary Be and B[e]
stars and the properties of their bow shocks. From the stand-off distance of
the bow shock we are able to determine the mass-loss rate of the binary system.
  Results. Although the velocities of the stars with respect to the
interstellar medium are quite low, we find bow shocks present in two systems,
namely $\pi$ Aqr, and $\varphi$ Per; a third system, CX Dra, shows a more
irregular circumstellar environment morphology which might somehow be related
to systemic mass loss. The properties of the two bow shocks point to mass-loss
rates and wind velocities typical of single B stars, which do not support an
enhanced systemic mass loss.

increases from one layer to three layers. The thermal conductivity of tri-layer
MoS2 approaches to that of bulk MoS2. Both the change of phonon dispersion and
the thickness-induced anharmonicity are important for explaining such a thermal
conductivity reduction. The increased anharmonicity in bi-layer MoS2 results in
stronger phonon scattering for ZAi modes, which is linked to the breakdown of
the symmetry in single-layer MoS2.

constant which becomes small at times when the bulk space-time is highly
curved. We investigate the propagation of small fluctuations of a test scalar
field from early times before the bulk singularity to late times after the

deformed AdS space-times, we can map the bulk evolution of the scalar field
onto the evolution of the boundary gauge field. The time evolution of
linearized fluctuations is well defined in the boundary theory as long as the
coupling remains finite, so that we can extend the boundary perturbations to
late times after the singularity. Assuming that the spacetime in the future of
the singularity has a weakly coupled region near the boundary, we reconstruct
the bulk fluctuations after the singularity crossing making use of generic
properties of boundary-to-bulk propagators. Finally, we extract the spectrum of
the fluctuations at late times given some initial spectrum. We find that the
spectral index is unchanged, but the amplitude increases due to the squeezing
of the fluctuations during the course of the evolution. This investigation can
teach us important lessons on how the spectrum of cosmological perturbations
passes through a bounce which is singular from the bulk point of view but which

  Coding Schemes",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The $k$-dimensional coding schemes refer to a collection of methods that
attempt to represent data using a set of representative $k$-dimensional
vectors, and include non-negative matrix factorization, dictionary learning,
sparse coding, $k$-means clustering and vector quantization as special cases.
Previous generalization bounds for the reconstruction error of the
$k$-dimensional coding schemes are mainly dimensionality independent. A major
advantage of these bounds is that they can be used to analyze the
generalization error when data is mapped into an infinite- or high-dimensional
feature space. However, many applications use finite-dimensional data features.
Can we obtain dimensionality-dependent generalization bounds for
$k$-dimensional coding schemes that are tighter than dimensionality-independent
bounds when data is in a finite-dimensional feature space? The answer is
positive. In this paper, we address this problem and derive a
dimensionality-dependent generalization bound for $k$-dimensional coding
schemes by bounding the covering number of the loss function class induced by
the reconstruction error. The bound is of order
$\mathcal{O}\left(\left(mk\ln(mkn)/n\right)^{\lambda_n}\right)$, where $m$ is
the dimension of features, $k$ is the number of the columns in the linear
implementation of coding schemes, $n$ is the size of sample, $\lambda_n>0.5$
when $n$ is finite and $\lambda_n=0.5$ when $n$ is infinite. We show that our
bound can be tighter than previous results, because it avoids inducing the
worst-case upper bound on $k$ of the loss function and converges faster. The
proposed generalization bound is also applied to some specific coding schemes
to demonstrate that the dimensionality-dependent bound is an indispensable
complement to these dimensionality-independent generalization bounds.

analysis is based on a 2D model (Suri ${\it et al.}$ 2014), derived from first

  We define ""scaffolds,"" a set of oriented edges that models the flow of

models. Despite this, there has been no dearth of criticism for this metric.
Most of these criticisms center around lack of correlation with extrinsic
metrics like word error rate (WER), dependence upon shared vocabulary for model
comparison and unsuitability for unnormalized language model evaluation. In
this paper, we address the last problem and propose a new discriminative
entropy based intrinsic metric that works for both traditional word level

propose a discriminatively trained sentence level interpretation of recurrent
neural network based language model (RNN) as an example of unnormalized
sentence level model. We demonstrate that for word level models, contrastive
entropy shows a strong correlation with perplexity. We also observe that when

to the WADC only when an event-triggering condition based on a predefined

stability criterion, and is monitored continuously by a separate

of the resulting closed loop system is guaranteed via the input-to-state

challenging and interesting problem in the underlay cognitive radio (CR)
systems. The self-interference introduced at the primary network may
dramatically impede the secondary user (SU) opportunity to access the spectrum.
To tackle this problem, we use the so-called improper Gaussian signaling.
Particularly, we assume a system with a SU pair working in a half-duplex mode
that uses improper Gaussian signaling while the FD PU pair implements the
regular proper Gaussian signaling. First, we derive a closed form expression
and an upper bound for the SU and PU outage probabilities, respectively.
Second, we optimize the SU signal parameters to minimize its outage probability
while maintaining the required PU quality-of-service based on the average
channel state information (CSI). Moreover, we provide the conditions to reap
merits from employing improper Gaussian signaling at the SU. Third, we design
the SU signal parameters based on perfect knowledge of its direct link
instantaneous CSI and investigate all benefits that can be achieved at both the
SU and PU. Finally, we provide some numerical results that demonstrate the
advantages of using improper Gaussian signaling to access the spectrum of the
FD PU.

telescopes have led to a desire to develop enhanced visualisations capable of
presenting information across a wide range of intensities. This paper describes
three new tools for astronomical visualisation and image manipulation that are
the result of a collaboration between software engineers and radio astronomers.
The first tool, FITS3D, is a fast, interactive 3D data cube viewer designed to
allow real-time interactive comparisons of multiple spectral line data cubes
simultaneously. It features region specific selection manipulation including
smoothing. The second tool, FITS2D, aids the visualisation and manipulation of
2D fits images. The tool supports the interactive creation of free-form masks
which allow the user to extract any (potentially non-contiguous) subset of a
fits image. It also supports annotations which can be placed without affecting
the underlying data. The final tool is an R package for applying high dynamic
range compression techniques to 2D fits images. This allows the full range of
pixel brightness to be imaged in a single image, simultaneously showing the
detail in bright sources while preserving the distinction of faint sources.
Here we will present these three tools and demonstrate their capability using
images from a range of astronomical images.

topological superconductors are coupled through a quantum dot. We focus on the
case with the bulk superconducting gap being the largest energy scale. Two
parameter regimes are investigated: a weak tunneling between the dot and the
superconductors, with the dot near its charge degeneracy point, and a strong
tunneling regime in which the transmission between the dot and the
superconductors is nearly perfect. We show that in the former situation, the
Andreev spectrum for each sector with fixed fermion parity consists of only two
levels, which gives rise to the nontrivial current-phase relation. Moreover, we
study the Rabi oscillation between the two levels and indicates that the
corresponding frequency is a $4\pi$-periodic function of the phase difference
between the two superconductors, which is immune to the quasiparticle
poisoning. In the latter case, we find that the Coulomb charging energy
enhances the effect of backscattering at the interfaces between the dot and the
superconductors. Both the temperature and the gate-voltage dependence of the
critical Josephson current are examined.

sources often have no bright points and are only detectable when viewed as a

all scales simultaneously by considering a tree of nested candidate bounding
boxes, and inverts a hierarchical Bayesian generative model to obtain the
probability of sources existing at given locations and sizes. This model
naturally accommodates the detection of nested sources, and no prior knowledge

algorithm scales nearly linear with the number of pixels making it feasible to
run on large images, and requires minimal parameter tweaking to be effective.

for Fire Containment (RMFC), are natural models for optimal inhibition of
harmful spreading processes. Despite considerable progress on several fronts,
the approximability of these problems is still badly understood. This is the
case even when the underlying graph is a tree, which is one of the most-studied
graph structures in this context and the focus of this paper. In their simplest
version, a fire spreads from one fixed vertex step by step from burning to
adjacent non-burning vertices, and at each time step, $B$ many non-burning
vertices can be protected from catching fire. The Firefighter problem asks, for
a given $B$, to maximize the number of vertices that will not catch fire,
whereas RMFC (on a tree) asks to find the smallest $B$ that allows for saving
all leaves of the tree. Prior to this work, the best known approximation ratios
were an $O(1)$-approximation for the Firefighter problem and an $O(\log^*
n)$-approximation for RMFC, both being LP-based and essentially matching the
integrality gaps of two natural LP relaxations.
  We improve on both approximations by presenting a PTAS for the Firefighter
problem and an $O(1)$-approximation for RMFC, both qualitatively matching the
known hardness results. Our results are obtained through a combination of the
known LPs with several new techniques, which allow for efficiently enumerating
subsets of super-constant size of a good solution to obtain stronger LPs.

single-mode fields employing a generalized quasiprobability function. Our
nonclassicality tests are based on the observation that two orthogonal
quadratures in phase space (position and momentum) behave as independent
realistic variables for a coherent state. Taking four (three) points at the
vertices of a rectangle (right triangle) in phase space, our tests detect every
pure nonclassical Gaussian state and a range of mixed Gaussian states. These
tests also set an upper bound for all Gaussian states and their mixtures, which
thereby provide criteria for genuine quantum non-Gaussianity. We optimize the
non-Gaussianity tests by employing a squeezing transformation in phase space
that converts a rectangle (right triangle) to a parallelogram (triangle), which
enlarges the set of non-Gaussian states detectable in our formulation. We
address fundamental and practical limits of our generalized phase-space tests
by looking into their relation with decoherence under a lossy Gaussian channel
and their robustness against finite data and nonoptimal choice of phase-space
points. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our parallelogram test can identify
useful resources for nonlocality testing in phase space.

for cloud fragmentation depends not only on the gas metallicity but also on the

chemical heating owing to molecular hydrogen formation even though dust cooling
becomes effective. Meanwhile, in several cases, efficient OH and H2O cooling
promotes the cloud elongation, and then cloud ""filamentation"" is driven by dust
thermal emission as a precursor of eventual fragmentation. While the filament
fragmentation is driven by rapid gas cooling with >10^{-5} Zsun, fragmentation
occurs in a different manner by the self-gravity of a circumstellar disk with
<10^{-5} Zsun. We use a semi-analytic model to estimate the number fraction of
the clouds which undergo the filament fragmentation to be a several percents
with 10^{-5}--10^{-4} Zsun. Overall, our simulations show a viable formation

arises inevitably in certain classes of F-theory GUTs with hypercharge flux
when the GUT symmetry is extended by a U(1) symmetry under which the Higgs
fields of the MSSM are not vector-like. The exotics are not vector-like under
the U(1) symmetry and therefore their mass is naturally related to its breaking
scale. Previously this scale was taken to be close to the GUT scale which led
to tension with proton decay, the $\mu$-term magnitude, and too large R-parity
violation. The 750 GeV excess provides new motivation for considering breaking
the U(1) around the TeV scale, which additionally alleviates the previous
problems. We study the possible TeV-scale spectrum in such an SU(5) GUT
scenario and show that it is constrained and predictive. Gauge coupling
unification can be retained at the accuracy of the MSSM at one loop even though
typically the spectrum does not form complete GUT representations. For example

the basic IO(1,1) Poincar\'e symmetry to IO(1,3) for the asymptotic fields
requiring physical states to be singlets under the A_4 symmetry that governs
the SO(3) embedding. This is linked to the three-family structure. For the
internal symmetries of the asymptotic fields an SU(2) x U(1) symmetry remains,
broken down as in the standard model. The boson excitations in d = 4 are
identified with electroweak gauge bosons and the Higgs boson. Fermion
excitations come in three families of leptons living in E(1,3) Minkowski space

model now emerge in a natural way. The supersymmetric starting point solves the
naturalness problem. The underlying left-right symmetry leads to custodial
symmetry in the electroweak sector. In the spectrum one has Dirac-type charged
leptons and Majorana-type neutrinos. The electroweak behavior of the naturally
confined quarks, leads to fractional electric charges and the doublet and

article, those graphs are called type-A meander graphs. Then the subalgebras of
seaweed type, or just ""seaweeds"", have been defined by Panyushev (2001) for
arbitrary simple Lie algebras. Namely, if $\mathfrak p_1,\mathfrak

used in case of the odd orthogonal Lie algebras. We also provide several
applications of our formula to the Frobenius seaweeds in $\mathfrak{sp}(2n)$.
In particular, using a natural partition of the set $\mathcal F_n$ of standard
Frobenius seaweeds, we prove that $\# \mathcal F_n$ strictly increases for the

matter, allowing strong field enhancement and confinement, large absorption and
scattering at resonance. However, simultaneous realization of ultra-narrow band
perfect absorption and electromagnetic field enhancement is challenging due to
the intrinsic high optical losses and radiative damping in metals. Here, we
propose an all-metal plasmonic absorber with an absorption bandwidth less than
8nm and polarization insensitive absorptivity exceeding 99%. Unlike traditional
Metal-Dielectric-Metal configurations, we demonstrate that the narrowband
perfect absorption and field enhancement are ascribed to the vertical gap
plasmonic mode in the deep subwavelength scale, which has a high quality factor
of 120 and mode volume of about 10^-4*({\lambda}/n)^3 . Based on the coupled
mode theory, we verify that the diluted field enhancement is proportional to
the absorption, and thus perfect absorption is critical to maximum field
enhancement. In addition, the proposed perfect absorber can be operated as a
refractive index sensor with a sensitivity of 885nm/RIU and figure of merit as
high as 110. It provides a new design strategy for narrow band perfect
absorption and local field enhancement, and has potential applications in

  improvement in accuracy","Submitted to Genome Biology",,"10.1186/s13059-016-1037-6",,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: The increasing volume and variety of genotypic and phenotypic
data is a major defining characteristic of modern biomedical sciences. At the
same time, the limitations in technology for generating data and the inherently
stochastic nature of biomolecular events have led to the discrepancy between
the volume of data and the amount of knowledge gleaned from it. A major
bottleneck in our ability to understand the molecular underpinnings of life is
the assignment of function to biological macromolecules, especially proteins.
While molecular experiments provide the most reliable annotation of proteins,
their relatively low throughput and restricted purview have led to an
increasing role for computational function prediction. However, accurately
assessing methods for protein function prediction and tracking progress in the
field remain challenging. Methodology: We have conducted the second Critical
Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA), a timed challenge to assess
computational methods that automatically assign protein function. One hundred
twenty-six methods from 56 research groups were evaluated for their ability to
predict biological functions using the Gene Ontology and gene-disease
associations using the Human Phenotype Ontology on a set of 3,681 proteins from
18 species. CAFA2 featured significantly expanded analysis compared with CAFA1,
with regards to data set size, variety, and assessment metrics. To review
progress in the field, the analysis also compared the best methods
participating in CAFA1 to those of CAFA2. Conclusions: The top performing
methods in CAFA2 outperformed the best methods from CAFA1, demonstrating that
computational function prediction is improving. This increased accuracy can be
attributed to the combined effect of the growing number of experimental
annotations and improved methods for function prediction.

number density in a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe in the
radiation-dominated era and in the epoch after decoupling of matter and
radiation is studied. For large-scale perturbations the outcome is in
accordance with treatments in the literature. For small-scale perturbations the
differences are conspicuous. Firstly, in the radiation-dominated era
small-scale perturbations grew proportional to the square root of time.
Secondly, perturbations in the Cold Dark Matter particle number density were,
due to gravitation, coupled to perturbations in the total energy density. This
implies that structure formation could have begun successfully only after
decoupling of matter and radiation. Finally, after decoupling density
perturbations evolved diabatically, i.e., they exchanged heat with their
environment. This heat exchange may have enhanced the growth rate of their mass
sufficiently to explain structure formation in the early universe, a phenomenon
which cannot be understood from adiabatic density perturbations.

of a certain kind of situations depending on random variables. The basic
concepts of the corresponding theory were introduced by Markov in 1907 on
coding literary texts. Since then, the Markov Chain theory was developerd by a
number of leading mathematicians, such as Kolmogorov, Feller etc. However, only
from the 1960's the importance of this theory to the Natural, Social and most
of the other Applied Sciences has been recognized. In this review paper we
present applications of finite Markov Chains to management problems, which can
be solved, as most of the problems concerning applications of Markov chains in
general do, by distinguishing between two types of Chains, the Ergodic and the
Absorbing ones.

instrumentalists and dancers in every style of music from classical to light in
India, mainly used for keeping rhythm. This percussion instrument consists of
two drums played by two hands, structurally different and produces different
harmonic sounds. Earlier work has done labeling tabla strokes from real time
performances by testing neural networks and tree based classification methods.
The current work extends previous work by C. V. Raman and S. Kumar in 1920 on
spectrum modeling of tabla strokes. In this paper we have studied spectral
characteristics (by wavelet analysis by sub band coding method and using
torrence wavelet tool) of nine strokes from each of five tablas using Wavelet
transform. Wavelet analysis is now a common tool for analyzing localized
variations of power within a time series and to find the frequency distribution
in time frequency space. Statistically, we will look into the patterns depicted
by harmonics of different sub bands and the tablas. Distribution of dominant
frequencies at different sub-band of stroke signals, distribution of power and
behavior of harmonics are the important features, leads to categorization of
tabla.

fidelity and unit probability. We show that the conditions for faithful
teleportation of a pure state or a mixed state can be described by the same
general relation $\rho_{q}\rho_{m} = pI$, where $\rho_{q}$ is the reduced
density matrix of the quantum channel, $\rho_{m}$ is the reduced density matrix
of the measurement basis, and $p$ is the probability of faithful teleportaion.
We investigate the invariance of faithful teleportation conditions under
unitary transformation. These results not only bring new insights to the
probabilistic quantum teleportation theory, but also offer operational
significance in that a simple procedure is provided to find out the faithful
teleportaiton probability and the matching measurement basis for any partially
entangled quantum channel.
