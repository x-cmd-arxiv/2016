clustering, has drawn recent attentions since it nicely addresses the
instability issue of traditional nonconvex clustering methods. Although its
computational and statistical properties have been recently studied, the
performance of convex clustering has not yet been investigated in the
high-dimensional clustering scenario, where the data contains a large number of
features and many of them carry no information about the clustering structure.
In this paper, we demonstrate that the performance of convex clustering could
be distorted when the uninformative features are included in the clustering. To
overcome it, we introduce a new clustering method, referred to as Sparse Convex
Clustering, to simultaneously cluster observations and conduct feature
selection. The key idea is to formulate convex clustering in a form of
regularization, with an adaptive group-lasso penalty term on cluster centers.
In order to optimally balance the tradeoff between the cluster fitting and
sparsity, a tuning criterion based on clustering stability is developed. In
theory, we provide an unbiased estimator for the degrees of freedom of the
proposed sparse convex clustering method. Finally, the effectiveness of the
sparse convex clustering is examined through a variety of numerical experiments
and a real data application.

effects of the perturbations of the scalar field and showing their relative
importance on the evolution of the mass function. By working in the framework

have a limited impact on the growth factor (for small coupling constant) and on

We also prove exponential smallness, in the frequency-distance to the
bifurcation point, of the Peierls-Nabarro energy barrier (PNB), as measured by
the difference in Hamiltonian or mass functionals evaluated on the onsite and
offsite states. These results extend those of the authors for the case of
nearest neighbor interactions to a large class of nonlocal short-range and
long-range interactions. The appearance of distinct onsite and offsite states
is a consequence of the breaking of continuous spatial translation invariance.
The PNB plays a role in the dynamics of energy transport in such nonlinear
Hamiltonian lattice systems.
  Our class of nonlocal interactions is defined in terms of coupling
coefficients, $J_m$, where $m\in\mathbb{Z}$ is the lattice site index, with
$J_m\simeq m^{-1-2s}, s\in[1,\infty)$ and $J_m\sim e^{-\gamma|m|},\ s=\infty,\
\gamma>0,$ (Kac-Baker). For $s\ge1$, the bifurcation is seeded by solutions of
the (effective / homogenized) cubic focusing nonlinear Schr{\""o}dinger equation
(NLS). However, for $1/4<s<1$, the bifurcation is controlled by the fractional
nonlinear Schr{\""o}dinger equation, FNLS, with $(-\Delta)^s$ replacing
$-\Delta$. The proof is based on a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction strategy applied
to a momentum space formulation. The PN barrier bounds require appropriate
uniform decay estimates for the discrete Fourier transform of DNLS discrete
solitary waves. A key role is also played by non-degeneracy of the ground state
of FNLS, recently proved by Frank, Lenzmann \& Silvestre.

turbulence likely increasing with the distance from the center. Accretion rates
between 6.3 10^{-5} and 5.6 10^{-4} \msun yr^{-1} are derived from the infall
observed in three of our sources. The outer water abundance is estimated to be
at the typical value of a few 10^{-8} while the inner abundance varies from 1.7
10^{-6} to 1.4 10^{-4} with respect to H2 depending on the source. We confirm
that regions of massive star formation are highly turbulent and that the
turbulence likely increases in the envelope with the distance to the star. The
inner abundances are lower than the expected 10^{-4} perhaps because our
observed lines do not probe deep enough into the inner envelope, or because
photodissociation through protostellar UV photons is more efficient than
expected. We show that the higher the infall/expansion velocity in the
protostellar envelope, the higher is the inner abundance, maybe indicating that
larger infall/expansion velocities generate shocks that will sputter water from

to develop compensatory mutations that increase the fitness again. The
possibility of switching phenotypes can reduce the time to adaptation by orders
of magnitude if the ""fitness valley"" caused by the deleterious mutation is deep

stages and an overall search intent. In this paper a new theoretical framework
for retrieval in these scenarios is proposed. We derive a general dynamic
utility function for optimizing over these types of tasks, that takes into
account the utility of each stage and the probability of observing user
feedback. We apply our framework to experiments over TREC data in the dynamic
multi page search scenario as a practical demonstration of its effectiveness
and to frame the discussion of its use, its limitations and to compare it
against the existing frameworks.

distributions of scanned surfaces quantitatively agree with the KPZ class in a
range similar or better than recent experimental evidences of the KPZ class
using SPM images. The underlying mechanism behind this artificial KPZ class is
the finite size of the probe tip, which does not permit a full resolution of
neither deep valleys or sloping borders of plateaus. The net result is a
scanned profile laterally thicker and higher than the original one implying an
excess growth, the major characteristic of the KPZ universality class. The
actual universality class of self-affine scanned surfaces are expected at long
times when the characteristic surface lengths become much larger than those of
the probe tip but our finds can be of relevance to experiments where
sufficiently long growth times cannot be easily achieved. We also propose that
the KPZ signatures can be also elicited in mounded surfaces with high aspect
ratio due to the interaction with the bulk of the probe tip. Strategies to
prevent false positives of the KPZ class are discussed.

sufficiently sensitive to detect variations in the Balmer continuum during
solar flares. Assuming that the Balmer-continuum kernels have at least a
similar size as those visible in H\alpha, we find the flux increase in the

in the convective region of stars. In low-mass stars, their dissipation plays a
prominent role in the long-term orbital evolution of short-period planets.
Turbulent convection can sustain differential rotation in their envelope, with
an equatorial acceleration (as in the Sun) or deceleration, which can modify
the waves' propagation properties. We explore in this first paper the general
propagation properties of free linear inertial waves in a differentially
rotating homogeneous fluid inside a spherical shell. We assume that the angular
velocity background flow depends on the latitudinal coordinate only, close to
what is expected in the external convective envelope of low-mass stars. We use
i) an analytical approach in the inviscid case to get the dispersion relation,
from which we compute the characteristic trajectories along which energy
propagates. This allows us to study the existence of attractor cycles and infer
the different families of inertial modes; ii) high-resolution numerical
calculations based on a spectral method for the viscous problem. We find that
modes that propagate in the whole shell (D modes) behave the same way as with
solid-body rotation. However, another family of inertial modes exists (DT
modes), which can propagate only in a restricted part of the convective zone.
Our study shows that they are less common than D modes and that the
characteristic rays and shear layers often focus towards a wedge - or
point-like attractor. More importantly, we find that for non-axisymmetric
oscillation modes, shear layers may cross a corotation resonance with a local
accumulation of kinetic energy. Their damping rate scales very differently from
what we obtain for standard D modes and we show an example where it is
independent of viscosity (Ekman number) in the astrophysical regime in which it
is small.

full-reference (FR) IQA and no-reference (NR) IQA according to whether the
original image is required. Although NR-IQA is widely used in practical
applications, room for improvement still remains because of the lack of the
reference image. Inspired by the fact that in many applications, such as
parameter selection, a series of distorted images are available, the authors
propose a novel comparison-based image quality assessment (C-IQA) method. The
new comparison-based framework parallels FR-IQA by requiring two input images,
and resembles NR-IQA by not using the original image. As a result, the new
comparison-based approach has more application scenarios than FR-IQA does, and
takes greater advantage of the accessible information than the traditional
single-input NR-IQA does. Further, C-IQA is compared with other
state-of-the-art NR-IQA methods on two widely used IQA databases. Experimental
results show that C-IQA outperforms the other NR-IQA methods for parameter

range 100 GeV - 10 TeV, as well as an extension of the observational
capabilities down to energies below 100 GeV and beyond 100 TeV. The array will
consist of two telescope networks (one in the Northern Hemisphere and another
in the South) so to achieve a full-sky coverage, and will be com- posed by a
hybrid system of 4 different telescope types. It will operate as an
observatory, granting open access to the community through calls for submission
of proposals competing for observation time. The CTA will give us access to the
non-thermal and high-energy universe at an unprecedented level, and will be one
of the main instruments for high-energy astrophysics and astroparticle physics
of the next 30 years. CTA has now entered its prototyping phase with the first,
stand-alone instruments being built. Brazil is an active member of the CTA
consortium, and the project is represented in Latin America also by Argentina,
Mexico and Chile. In the next few months the consortium will define the site
for instal- lation of CTA South, which might come to be hosted in the Chilean
Andes, with important impact for the high-energy community in Latin America. In
this talk we will present the basic concepts of the CTA and the detailed

the observatory, whose first seed, the ASTRI mini-array, is currently being
constructed in Sicily, in a cooperation between Italy, Brazil and South Africa.

one can have pure spin currents flowing in opposite directions in the two

means that the twin effects of quantum valley Hall and quantum spin Hall can
both be probed simultaneously in the proposed device. This work will
significantly advance the field of graphene spintronics, hitherto hobbled by

orientation with upflow in the West, consistent with a broken azimuthal
invariance due to Earth's Coriolis force [see \cite{BA06b}]. They yielded the
azimuthal diffusivity $D_\theta$ and a corresponding Reynolds number
$Re_{\theta}$ for Rayleigh numbers over the range $2\times 10^{12} < Ra <

larger $Ra$ the data for $Re_{\theta}(Ra)$ revealed a transition to a new

reveals that the well-defined delay time of the eigenstates are formed by
multi-path interference, which can be effectively manipulated by the spatial
degrees of freedom of the input wavefront. This study is essential to
controlling the dynamics of wave scattering, paving the way for coherent
control of pulse propagation through complex media.

high-throughput computational techniques are revolutionizing experimental
discovery of the thermodynamically stable inorganic materials. Metastable
materials represent a new frontier for studies, since even simple binary non
ground state compounds of common elements may be awaiting discovery. However,
there are significant research challenges related to non-equilibrium thin film
synthesis and crystal structure predictions, such as small strained crystals in
the experimental samples and energy minimization based theoretical algorithms.
Here we report on experimental synthesis and characterization, as well as
theoretical first-principles calculations of a previously unreported
mixed-valent binary tin nitride. Thin film experiments indicate that this novel
material is N-deficient SnN with tin in the mixed II/IV valence state and a
small low-symmetry unit cell. Theoretical calculations suggest that the most
likely crystal structure has the space group 2 (SG2) related to the distorted
delafossite (SG166), which is nearly 0.1 eV/atom above the ground state SnN
polymorph. This observation is rationalized by the structural similarity of the
SnN distorted delafossite to the chemically related Sn3N4 spinel compound,
which provides a fresh scientific insight into the reasons for growth of
polymorphs of the metastable material. In addition to reporting on the
discovery of the simple binary SnN compound, this paper illustrates a possible
way of combining a wide range of advanced characterization techniques with the
first-principle property calculation methods, to elucidate the most likely
crystal structure of the previously unreported metastable materials.

quantities depends on the angular distance to the source, which evolves with z
according to the assumed background cosmology. An accurate determination of
f_gas(z) for a large sample of hot (kT_e > 5 keV), dynamically relaxed clusters
could therefore be used as a probe of the cosmological expansion up to z < 2.
The fraction f_gas(z) would remain constant only when the ""correct"" cosmology
is used to fit the data. In this paper, we compare the predicted gas mass
fractions for both LCDM and the R_h=ct Universe and test them against the 3
largest cluster samples. We show that R_h=ct is consistent with a constant
f_gas in the redshift range z < 2, as was previously shown for the reference
LCDM model (with parameter values H_0=70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m=0.3 and w_de=-1).
Unlike LCDM, however, the R_h=ct Universe has no free parameters to optimize in
fitting the data. Model selection tools, such as the Akaike Information

favour R_h=ct over LCDM. For example, the BIC favours R_h=ct with a likelihood

that widely cherished inference algorithms like maximum likelihood (ML) and
maximum-a posteriori (MAP) inference cannot achieve these limits. We further
find optimal, computationally tractable algorithms that can achieve these

computationally simpler than MAP and ML, while still outperforming them. For

models have problems in describing these interfaces in the presence of doping,
due to a poor representation of space-charge effects. Conversely, the present

be mapped to Horndeski through a generalised disformal transformation. This

Prandtl number used is 0.05 while the molecular Schmidt number Sc of the fluid
varies between 0.1 and 2. An effective diffusivity coefficient for the mixing
is numerically measured by the decay process of a global concentration peak
located between the cylinder walls. We find that only models with Sc>0.1 do
provide finite eddy diffusivity values. We also find that for quasi-Kepler
rotation at a magnetic Mach number Mm~2 the flow transits from the
slow-rotation regime to the fast-rotation regime. For fixed Reynolds number the
relation between the normalized eddy diffusivity and the Schmidt number of the

result is that $D_\beta$ is nonempty if and only if the number $1$ has a unique

in realistic potentials can locally enhance the densities along streams, making
streams denser than their counterparts in smooth potentials. We show that many

quantitatively and objectively infer the perceived level of noxious stimuli
from the behavior of animals. Here we develop a quantitative model to infer the
perceived level of thermal nociception from the stereotyped nociceptive
response of individual nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans stimulated by an IR

chemical stimuli or genetic mutations in C. elegans. We test the nociception of

we show that the perception of thermal nociception for the ibuprofen treated
worms is lower than the wild-type. At the same time, our model shows that the
mutant changes the worm's behavior beyond affecting nociception. Finally, we
determine the stimulus level that best distinguishes the analgesic effects and

linear codes achieves capacity on an erasure channel under maximum a posteriori
decoding. Rather than relying on the precise structure of the codes our method
exploits code symmetry. In particular, the technique applies to any sequence of
linear codes where the blocklengths are strictly increasing, the code rates
converge, and the permutation group of each code is doubly transitive. In other
words, we show that symmetry alone implies near-optimal performance.
  An important consequence of this result is that a sequence of Reed-Muller
codes with increasing blocklength and converging rate achieves capacity. This
possibility has been suggested previously in the literature but it has only
been proven for cases where the limiting code rate is 0 or 1. Moreover, these
results extend naturally to all affine-invariant codes and, thus, to extended
primitive narrow-sense BCH codes. This also resolves, in the affirmative, the
existence question for capacity-achieving sequences of binary cyclic codes. The
primary tools used in the proof are the sharp threshold property for symmetric
monotone boolean functions and the area theorem for extrinsic information
transfer functions.

in quantum walks and the resulting transition to classical random walks.
Interestingly, it has been shown that algorithmic properties of quantum walks
with decoherence such as the spreading rate are sometimes better than their
purely quantum counterparts. Not only quantum walks with decoherence provide a
generalization of quantum walks that naturally encompasses both the quantum and
classical case, but they also give rise to new and different probability
distribution. The application of quantum walks with decoherence to large graphs
is limited by the necessity of evolving a state vector whose size is quadratic
in the number of nodes of the graph, as opposed to the linear state vector of
the purely quantum (or classical) case. In this technical report, we show how
to use perturbation theory to reduce the computational complexity of evolving a
continuous-time quantum walk subject to decoherence. More specifically, given a

both graph drawing and normalized cut K-clustering can be easily generalized to

distance or dissimilarity. The solution is to replace the degree matrix by the

galaxies. However, about a third of the more massive galaxies at those times
were quiescent in the sense that their observed stellar populations are
inconsistent with rapid star formation. The reduced star formation activity is
often attributed to gaseous outflows driven by feedback from supermassive black
holes, but the impact of black hole feedback on galaxies in the young Universe
is not yet definitively established. We analyze the origin of quiescent
galaxies with the help of ultra-high resolution, cosmological simulations that
include feedback from stars but do not model the uncertain consequences of
black hole feedback. We show that dark matter halos with specific accretion
rates below ~0.25-0.4 per Gyr preferentially host galaxies with reduced star
formation rates and red broad-band colors. The fraction of such halos in large
dark matter only simulations matches the observed fraction of massive quiescent
galaxies (~10^10-10^11 Msun). This strongly suggests that halo accretion rate
is the key parameter determining which massive galaxies at z~1.5-3 become
quiescent. Empirical models that connect galaxy and halo evolution, such as
halo occupation distribution or abundance matching models, assume a tight link
between galaxy properties and the masses of their parent halos. These models
will benefit from adding the specific accretion rate of halos as a second model
parameter.

gas at T~10^4 K with low molecular abundance - which represent key aspects of
the DCBH scenario - provide optimal conditions for pumping of the 2p-level of
atomic hydrogen by trapped Lyman alpha (Lya) photons. This Lya pumping
mechanism gives rise to inverted level population of the 2s_1/2-2p_3/2

between {\Sigma}SFR and {\Delta}(sSFR) (distance from the MS) suggesting that
galaxies with higher sSFR are characterised by denser star formation activity.
Similarly, we find evidence for an anti-correlation between the gas phase
metallicity (Z) and the {\Delta}(sSFR), suggesting a 0.2dex variation in the
metal content of galaxies within the MS and significantly lower metallicities
for galaxies above it. The origin of the observed trends between {\Sigma}SFR -
{\Sigma}(sSFR) and Z - {\Delta}(sSFR) could be driven by an interplay between
variations of the gas fraction or the star formation efficiency of the galaxies
along and off the MS. To address this, follow-up observations of the our sample
that will allow gas mass estimates are necessary.

away from the main resonances, allows us to investigate a snapshot of the

those recently observed in the extended Solar neighbourhood. We show that these
analytically predicted mean stellar motions are in agreement with the outcome
of test-particle simulations. Moreover, we estimate for the first time the

masses. The galaxy sample is divided into a fine grid of bins in the M_*-SFR
parameter space, for each of which we produce a composite spectrum by stacking
together the SDSS spectra of the galaxies contained in that bin. We exploit the
high signal-to-noise of the stacked spectra to study the emergence of faint
features of optical emission lines that may trace galactic outflows and would
otherwise be too faint to detect in individual galaxy spectra. We adopt a novel
approach that relies on the comparison between the line-of-sight velocity
distribution (LoSVD) of the ionised gas (as traced by the [OIII]5007 and
Halpha+[NII]6548,6583 emission lines) and the LoSVD of the stars, which are
used as a reference tracing virial motions. Significant deviations of the gas
kinematics from the stellar kinematics in the high velocity tail of the LoSVDs
are interpreted as a signature of outflows. Our results suggest that the
incidence of ionised outflows increases with SFR and sSFR. The outflow velocity
(v_out) correlates tightly with the SFR for SFR>1 M_Sun/yr, whereas at lower
SFRs the dependence of v_out on SFR is nearly flat. The outflow velocity,
although with a much larger scatter, increases also with the stellar velocity
dispersion, and we infer velocities as high as v_out~(6-8)*sigma_stars.
Strikingly, we detect the signature of ionised outflows only in galaxies
located above the main sequence (MS) of star forming galaxies in the M_*-SFR
diagram, and the incidence of such outflows increases sharply with the offset
from the MS. Our complementary analysis of the stellar kinematics reveals the
presence of blue asymmetries of a few 10 km/s in the stellar LoSVDs. [abridged]

communications systems. Interference is one of the important obstacles to reach
this purpose. Interference alignment is a management technique that align
interference from other transmitters in the least possible dimension subspace

interference signal. An uncoordinated interference is an example of
interference which cannot be aligned coordinately with interference from
coordinated part and consequently, the performance of interference alignment
approaches is degraded. In this paper, we propose two rank minimization methods
to enhance the performance of interference alignment in the presence of
uncoordinated interference sources. Firstly, a new objective function is chosen
then, a new class of convex relaxation is proposed with respect to the
uncoordinated interference which leads to decrease the optimal value of our
optimization problem. Moreover, we use schatten-p-norm as surrogate of rank
function and we implement iteratively reweighted algorithm to solve
optimization problem. In addition, we apply our proposed methods to mitigate
interference in relay-aided MIMO interference channel, and propose a
weighted-sum method to improve the performance of interference alignment in the
amplify-and-forward relay-aided MIMO system based on the rank minimization

simple isothermal distribution of dark matter, the Standard Halo Model (SHM).
Yet there has been skepticism regarding the validity of this simple model due
to the complicated gravitational collapse and merger history of actual
galaxies. In this paper we compare the SHM to the results of cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation to investigate whether or not
the SHM is a good representation of the true WIMP distribution in the analysis
of direct detection data. We examine two Milky Way-like galaxies from the
MaGICC cosmological simulations (a) with dark matter only and (b) with baryonic
physics included. The inclusion of baryons drives the shape of the DM halo to
become more spherical and makes the velocity distribution of dark matter
particles less anisotropic especially at large heliocentric velocities, thereby
making the SHM a better fit. We also note that we do not find a significant
disk-like rotating dark matter component in either of the two galaxy halos with
baryons that we examine, suggesting that dark disks are not a generic
prediction of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We conclude that in the
Solar neighborhood, the SHM is in fact a good approximation to the true dark
matter distribution in these cosmological simulations (with baryons) which are
reasonable representations of the Milky Way, and hence can also be used for the
purpose of dark matter direct detection calculations.

Cepheid distances, in view of the calibration of their distance scale. However,
the conversion of radial to pulsational velocities in the PoP method relies on
a poorly calibrated parameter, the projection factor (p-factor). We aim to
measure empirically the value of the p-factors of a homogeneous sample of nine
Galactic Cepheids for which trigonometric parallaxes were measured with the

instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, completed by data from
the literature. Using the known distance as an input, we derive the value of
the p-factor and study its dependence with the pulsation period. We find the
following p-factors: 1.20 $\pm$ 0.12 for RT Aur, 1.48 $\pm$ 0.18 for T Vul,
1.14 $\pm$ 0.10 for FF Aql, 1.31 $\pm$ 0.19 for Y Sgr, 1.39 $\pm$ 0.09 for X

consistently close to p = 1.324 $\pm$ 0.024. We observe some dispersion around
this average value, but the observed distribution is statistically consistent
with a constant value of the p-factor as a function of the pulsation period.
The error budget of our determination of the p-factor values is presently
dominated by the uncertainty on the parallax, a limitation that will soon be
waived by Gaia.

availability of significant numbers of multi-model (MME) and multi-initial

analysis of CIV versus model response variability (MRV). Understanding the
relative agreement and variability of MME and MICE ensembles for multiple

improvements, diagnostics, and prognosis, as well as impacts, adaptation, and
vulnerability studies. Here we find that CIV (MICE agreement) is lower (higher)

horizons for both temperature and precipitation. However, CIV dominates MRV
over higher latitudes generally and in specific regions. Furthermore, CIV is

Einstein-dilaton gravity. We show that the reality of Lifshitz supporting
Maxwell matter fields exclude the negative horizon curvature solutions except
for the asymptotic AdS case. Calculating the conserved and thermodynamical
quantities, we obtain a Smarr type formula for the mass and confirm that
thermodynamics first law is satisfied on the black hole horizon. Afterward, we
study the thermal stability of our solutions and figure out the effects of
different parameters on the stability of solutions under thermal perturbations.
Next, we apply the gauge/gravity duality in order to calculate the ratio of
shear viscosity to entropy for a three-dimensional hydrodynamic system by using
the pole method. Furthermore, we study the behavior of holographic conductivity
for two-dimensional systems such as graphene. We consider linear Maxwell and
nonlinear exponential electrodynamics separately and disclose the effect of
nonlinearity on holographic conductivity. We indicate that holographic
conductivity vanishes for $z>3$ in the case of nonlinear electrodynamics while
it does not in the linear Maxwell case. Finally, we solve perturbative
additional field equations numerically and plot the behaviors of real and
imaginary parts of conductivity for asymptotic AdS and Lifshitz cases. We
present experimental results match with our numerical ones.

spatio-temporal profile. Moreover, the effect of modal dispersion on mode

our approach can yield any required accuracy by retaining as many terms in the
expansion as needed. It also avoids various artifacts of previous derivations
by introducing the correct form of the solution. We then provide what is, to
the best of our knowledge, the first ever validation of the coupled mode
equations with exact numerical simulations, and demonstrate the wide range of
possibilities enabled by spatio-temporal perturbations of pulses, including
pulse shortening or broadening or more complex shaping. Our formulation is
valid across the electromagnetic spectrum, and can be applied directly also to

analysis and there is a plethora of algorithms for solving such problems. Many
of these algorithms employ sub-sampling, as a way to either speed up the
computations and/or to implicitly implement a form of statistical
regularization. In this paper, we consider second-order iterative optimization
algorithms and we provide bounds on the convergence of the variants of Newton's
method that incorporate uniform sub-sampling as a means to estimate the
gradient and/or Hessian. Our bounds are non-asymptotic and quantitative. Our
algorithms are global and are guaranteed to converge from any initial iterate.
  Using random matrix concentration inequalities, one can sub-sample the
Hessian to preserve the curvature information. Our first algorithm incorporates
Hessian sub-sampling while using the full gradient. We also give additional
convergence results for when the sub-sampled Hessian is regularized by
modifying its spectrum or ridge-type regularization. Next, in addition to
Hessian sub-sampling, we also consider sub-sampling the gradient as a way to
further reduce the computational complexity per iteration. We use approximate
matrix multiplication results from randomized numerical linear algebra to
obtain the proper sampling strategy. In all these algorithms, computing the
update boils down to solving a large scale linear system, which can be
computationally expensive. As a remedy, for all of our algorithms, we also give
global convergence results for the case of inexact updates where such linear
system is solved only approximately.
  This paper has a more advanced companion paper, [42], in which we demonstrate
that, by doing a finer-grained analysis, we can get problem-independent bounds
for local convergence of these algorithms and explore trade-offs to improve
upon the basic results of the present paper.

uniformly sub-sampled. Using random matrix concentration inequalities, one can
sub-sample in a way that the curvature information is preserved. Using such
sub-sampling strategy, we establish locally Q-linear and Q-superlinear

  While the sample size depends on the condition number of the problem, our
convergence rates are problem-independent, i.e., they do not depend on the

allocate resources that are useful for learning the target's properties in

simple two-stage recommendation combining a sequential and a batch solution
together. We first model the problem with the partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) and provide an exact solution. Then, through an
in-depth analysis over the POMDP value iteration solution, we identify that an
exact solution can be abstracted as selecting resources that are not only
highly relevant to the target according to the initial-stage information, but
also highly correlated, either positively or negatively, with other potential
resources for the next stage. With this finding, we propose an approximate

  Let $H$ be a set of $n$ planes in three dimensions, and let $r \leq n$ be a
parameter. We give a simple alternative proof of the existence of a
$(1/r)$-cutting of the first $n/r$ levels of $\Arr(H)$, which consists of
$O(r)$ semi-unbounded vertical triangular prisms. The same construction yields
an approximation of the $(n/r)$-level by a terrain consisting of $O(r/\eps^3)$
triangular faces, which lies entirely between the levels $(1\pm\eps)n/r$. The
proof does not use sampling, and exploits techniques based on planar separators
and various structural properties of levels in three-dimensional arrangements
and of planar maps. The proof is constructive, and leads to a simple randomized
algorithm, with expected near-linear running time. An application of this
technique allows us to mimic Matousek's construction of cuttings in the plane,
to obtain a similar construction of ""layered"" $(1/r)$-cutting of the entire
arrangement $\Arr(H)$, of optimal size $O(r^3)$. Another application is a
simplified optimal approximate range counting algorithm in three dimensions,
competing with that of Afshani and Chan.

sampling techniques are proposed in this paper (i.e., SMOTERandRep, Lax Random
Oversampling, Lax Random Undersampling, Combined-Lax Random Oversampling
Undersampling, and Combined-Lax Random Undersampling Oversampling) that were
based on the three sampling techniques (i.e., Random Undersampling, Random
Oversampling, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) usually used as
solutions in imbalance learning. The metrics used to evaluate the classifier's
performance were F-measure and G-mean. F-measure determines the performance of
the classifier for every class, while G-mean measures the overall performance
of the classifier. The results using F-measure showed that for the data without
a sampling technique, the classifier's performance is good only for the
majority class. It also showed that among the eight sampling techniques, RU and
LRU have the worst performance while other techniques (i.e., RO, C-LRUO and
C-LROU) performed well only on some classes. The best performing techniques in
all data sets were SMOTE, SMOTERandRep, and LRO having the lowest F-measure
values between 0.5 and 0.65. The results using G-mean showed that the
oversampling technique that attained the highest G-mean value is LRO (0.86),
next is C-LROU (0.85), then SMOTE (0.84) and finally is SMOTERandRep (0.83).
Combining the result of the two metrics (F-measure and G-mean), only the three
sampling techniques are considered as good performing (i.e., LRO, SMOTE, and
SMOTERandRep).

addition, from a weak-coupling renormalization group treatment of an effective
model Hamiltonian, we find that SOC favors the odd parity $A_{1u}$ state with
$S_z = \pm 1$ over the $B$ states with $S_z=0$, where $z$ denotes the
least-conducting direction. We discuss possible definitive experimental
signatures of this superconducting state.

We study several particular configurations which can be addressed with the
Euclidean world-sheet instanton technique, the analogue of the world-line
instanton for particles. In the first case the string is suspended between two
D-branes in flat space-time, in the second case the string lives in AdS and
terminates on one D-brane (this realizes the holographic Schwinger effect). In
some regions of parameter space the result is well approximated by the known
analytical formulas, either the particle pair production in non-homogeneous
background or the string pair production in homogeneous background. In other
cases we see effects which are intrinsically stringy and related to the
non-homogeneity of the background. The pair production is enhanced already for
particles in time dependent electric field backgrounds. The string nature
enhances this even further. For spacial varying electrical background fields
the string pair production is less suppressed than the rate of particle pair
production. We discuss in some detail how the critical field is affected by the
non-homogeneity, for both time and space dependent electric field backgrouds.
We also comment on what could be an interesting new prediction for the small
field limit. The third case we consider is pair production in holographic
confining backgrounds with homogeneous and non-homogeneous fields.

truncated by HQET power counting at $\mathrm{O}(\Lambda^3/m_Q^3)$ for
heavy-light systems, and by NRQCD power counting at $\mathrm{O}(v^6)$ for

coprime, on a strip of $N$ columns with the $(r,s)$ Robin boundary conditions
introduced by Pearce, Rasmussen and Tipunin. The associated conformal boundary
conditions are labelled by the Kac labels $r\in{\Bbb Z}$ and $s\in{\Bbb N}$.
The Robin vacuum boundary condition, labelled by
$(r,s\!-\!\frac{1}{2})=(0,\mbox{$\textstyle \frac{1}{2}$})$, is given as a
linear combination of Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The general
$(r,s)$ Robin boundary conditions are constructed, using fusion, by acting on
the Robin vacuum boundary with an $(r,s)$-type seam consisting of an $r$-type
seam of width $w$ columns and an $s$-type seam of width $d=s-1$ columns. The
$r$-type seam admits an arbitrary boundary field which we fix to the special
value $\xi=-\tfrac{\lambda}{2}$ where $\lambda=\frac{(p'-p)\pi}{2p'}$ is the
crossing parameter. The $s$-type boundary introduces $d$ defects into the bulk.
We consider the associated quantum Hamiltonians and calculate analytically the
boundary free energies of the $(r,s)$ Robin boundary conditions. Using
finite-size corrections and sequence extrapolation out to system sizes
$N+w+d\le 26$, the conformal spectrum of boundary operators is accessible by
numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonians. Fixing the parity of $N$ for
$r\ne 0$ and restricting to the ground state sequences
$w=\big\lfloor\frac{|r|p'}{p}\big\rfloor$, $r\in{\Bbb Z}$ with the inverse
$r=(-1)^{N+w+d}\big\lceil \frac{p w}{p'}\big\rceil$, we find that the conformal
weights take the values $\Delta^{p,p'}_{r,s-\frac12}$ where
$\Delta^{p,p'}_{r,s}$ is given by the usual Kac formula. The $(r,s)$ Robin
boundary conditions are thus conjugate to scaling operators with half-integer
values for the Kac label $s-\mbox{$\textstyle \frac{1}{2}$}$.

of these data presented in Sing et al. (2016). WASP-39b is predicted to have a

since the work of Drinfeld (1986), Lusztig (1989), and Etingof-Ginzburg (2002)
on deformations of skew group algebras $H \ltimes {\rm Sym}(V)$, as well as for
other cocommutative Hopf algebras $H$. In this paper we show that such PBW
theorems do not require the full Hopf algebra structure, by working in the more
general setting of a ""cocommutative algebra"", which involves a coproduct but
not a counit or antipode. Special cases include infinitesimal Hecke algebras,
as well as symplectic reflection algebras, rational Cherednik algebras, and
more generally, Drinfeld orbifold algebras. In this generality we identify
precise conditions that are equivalent to the PBW property, including a
Yetter-Drinfeld type compatibility condition and a Jacobi identity. We also
characterize the graded deformations that possess the PBW property. In turn,
the PBW property helps identify an analogue of symplectic reflections in
general cocommutative bialgebras.
  Next, we introduce a family of cocommutative algebras outside the
traditionally studied settings: generalized nil-Coxeter algebras. These are
necessarily not Hopf algebras, in fact, not even (weak) bialgebras. For the
corresponding family of deformed smash product algebras, we compute the center
as well as abelianization, and classify all simple modules.

enhanced. The increase in Tc with respect to the bulk is greatest in a hollow

sparsely connected agents. The network objective is to test a simple null
hypothesis against a composite alternative concerning the state of the field,
modeled as a vector of (continuous) unknown parameters determining the
parametric family of probability measures induced on the agents' observation
spaces under the hypotheses. Specifically, under the alternative hypothesis,
each agent sequentially observes an independent and identically distributed
time-series consisting of a (nonlinear) function of the true but unknown
parameter corrupted by Gaussian noise, whereas, under the null, they obtain
noise only. Two distributed recursive generalized likelihood ratio test type
algorithms of the \emph{consensus+innovations} form are proposed, namely
$\mathcal{CIGLRT-L}$ and $\mathcal{CIGLRT-NL}$, in which the agents estimate
the underlying parameter and in parallel also update their test decision
statistics by simultaneously processing the latest local sensed information and
information obtained from neighboring agents. For $\mathcal{CIGLRT-NL}$, for a
broad class of nonlinear observation models and under a global observability
condition, algorithm parameters which ensure asymptotically decaying
probabilities of errors~(probability of miss and probability of false
detection) are characterized. For $\mathcal{CIGLRT-L}$, a linear observation
model is considered and upper bounds on large deviations decay exponent for the
error probabilities are obtained.

and published in 2006 by Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld-Lemieux as a protocol suitable
for use on platforms with constrained computational resources, such as FPGAs,
ASICs, and wireless sensors. It is a group-theoretic cryptographic protocol
that allows two users to construct a shared secret via a Diffie-Hellman-type
scheme over an insecure channel.
  Building on the refuted 2012 permutation-based attack of
Kalka-Teichner-Tsaban, in 2015 Ben-Zvi-Blackburn-Tsaban (BBT) presented a
heuristic attack that attempts to recover the AEDH shared secret. In their
paper BBT reference the AEDH protocol as presented to ISO for certification
(ISO 29167-20) by SecureRF. The ISO draft contains two profiles using the
Algebraic Eraser. One profile is unaffected by this attack; the second profile
is subject to their attack provided the attack runs in real time. This is not
the case in most practical deployments.
  The BBT attack is simply a targeted attack that does not attempt to break the
method, system parameters, or recover any private keys. Rather, its limited
focus is to recover the shared secret in a single transaction. In addition, the
BBT attack is based on several conjectures that are assumed to hold when
parameters are chosen according to standard distributions, which can be
mitigated, if not avoided. This paper shows how to choose special distributions
so that these conjectures do not hold making the BBT attack ineffective for
braid groups with sufficiently many strands. Further, the BBT attack assumes
that certain data is available to an attacker, but there are realistic
deployment scenarios where this is not the case, making the attack fail
completely. In summary, the BBT attack is flawed (with respect to the SecureRF
ISO draft) and, at a minimum, over-reaches as to its applicability.

second step either in the Fr\""olicher spectral sequence of an arbitrary compact
complex manifold $X$ or in the spectral sequence associated with a pair
$(N,\,F)$ of complementary regular holomorphic foliations on such a manifold.
The main idea is to introduce a Laplace-type operator associated with a given
Hermitian metric on $X$ whose kernel in every bidegree $(p,\,q)$ is isomorphic
to $E_2^{p,\,q}$ in either of the two situations discussed. The surprising
aspect is that this operator is not a differential operator since it involves a
harmonic projection, although it depends on certain differential operators. We
then use this Hodge isomorphism for $E_2^{p,\,q}$ to give sufficient conditions
for the degeneration at $E_2$ of the spectral sequence considered in each of
the two cases in terms of the existence of certain metrics on $X$. For example,
in the Fr\""olicher case we prove degeneration at $E_2$ if there exists an SKT
metric $\omega$ (i.e. such that $\partial\bar\partial\omega=0$) whose torsion
is small compared to the spectral gap of the elliptic operator $\Delta' +
\Delta""$ defined by $\omega$. In the foliated case, we obtain degeneration at
$E_2$ under a hypothesis involving the Laplacians $\Delta'_N$ and $\Delta'_F$
associated with the splitting $\partial = \partial_N + \partial_F$ induced by
the foliated structure.

from CO, 13CO, and C18O at the centers of the 250 cores were extracted from
previous mapping observations to construct a multi-line data set. The
significantly low detection rate of asymmetric double-peaked profiles, together
with the well consistence among central velocities of CO, HCO+, and HCN
spectra, suggests that the CO-selected Planck cores are more quiescent compared
to classical star-forming regions. The small difference between line widths of
C18O and HCN indicates that the inner regions of CO-selected Planck cores are
not more turbulent than the exterior. The velocity-integrated intensities and
abundances of HCO+ are positively correlated with those of HCN, suggesting
these two species are well coupled and chemically connected. The detected
abundances of both HCO+ and HCN are significantly lower than values in other
low- to high-mass star-forming regions. The low abundances may be due to beam
dilution. On the basis of the inspection of the parameters given in the PGCC

direction for a material under longitudinal deformation. Though negative
Poisson's ratios (NPR) are theoretically possible within continuum elasticity,
they are most frequently observed in engineered materials and structures, as
they are not intrinsic to many materials. In this work, we report NPR in
single-layer graphene ribbons, which results from the compressive edge stress
induced warping of the edges. The effect is robust, as the NPR is observed for
graphene ribbons with widths smaller than about 10 nm, and for tensile strains
smaller than about 0.5%, with NPR values reaching as large as -1.51. The NPR is
explained analytically using an inclined plate model, which is able to predict
the Poisson's ratio for graphene sheets of arbitrary size. The inclined plate
model demonstrates that the NPR is governed by the interplay between the width
(a bulk property), and the warping amplitude of the edge (an edge property),
which eventually yields a phase diagram determining the sign of the Poisson's
ratio as a function of the graphene geometry.

We derive the general analytical expressions for the two-dimensional

we specify magnetic-field components for the prominence, which corresponds to a
dense and cold plasma residing in the dip of curved magnetic-field lines. With
the adaptation of these expressions, we solve numerically the 2D, nonlinear,
ideal MHD equations for a Pikelner's model of a prominence that is initially
perturbed by reducing the gas pressure at the dip of magnetic-field lines. Our
findings reveal that as a result of pressure perturbations the prominence
plasma starts evolving in time and this leads to the antisymmetric
magnetoacoustic--gravity oscillations as well as to the mass-density growth at
the magnetic dip, and the magnetic-field lines subside there. This growth
depends on the depth of magnetic dip. For a shallower dip, less plasma is
condensed and vice-versa. We conjecture that the observed long-period
magnetoacoustic-gravity oscillations in various prominence systems are in
general the consequence of the internal pressure perturbations of the plasma
residing in equilibrium at the prominence dip.

the challenge of localizing objects at small scale, two localization networks
which are specialized for localizing objects with different scales are
introduced, following the divide-and-conquer philosophy. Location outputs of
these two networks are then adaptively combined to generate the final proposals
by a large-/small-size weighting network. Extensive evaluations on PASCAL VOC

high-quality proposals from SPOP network also significantly improve the mean

the SPOP network (trained on PASCAL VOC) shows great generalization performance

The algorithm is based on a key observation that quadratic polynomial
inequalities can be linearized if they are concave. A generalization of
Motzkin's transposition theorem is proved, which is used to generate an
interpolant between two mutually contradictory conjunctions of polynomial
inequalities, using semi-definite programming in time complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n^3+nm))$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $m$ is the
number of inequalities. Using the framework proposed by \cite{SSLMCS2008} for
combining interpolants for a combination of quantifier-free theories which have
their own interpolation algorithms, a combination algorithm is given for the
combined theory of concave quadratic polynomial inequalities and the equality
theory over uninterpreted functions symbols (\textit{EUF}). The proposed
approach is applicable to all existing abstract domains like \emph{octagon},
\emph{polyhedra}, \emph{ellipsoid} and so on, therefore it can be used to
improve the scalability of existing verification techniques for programs and

generalizations of many well-studied objects in combinatorics, cryptography and

theory, we solve several open problems and conjectures concerning bounds and
constructions for separating hash families. Firstly, we discover that the
cardinality of a separating hash family satisfies a Johnson-type inequality. As
a result, we obtain a new upper bound, which is superior to all previous ones.
Secondly, we present a construction for an infinite class of perfect hash
families. It is based on the Hamming graphs in coding theory and generalizes
many constructions that appeared before. It provides an affirmative answer to
both Bazrafshan-Trung's open problem on separating hash families and
Alon-Stav's conjecture on parent-identifying codes. Thirdly, let $p_t(N,q)$
denote the maximal cardinality of a $t$-perfect hash family of length $N$ over
an alphabet of size $q$. Walker II and Colbourn conjectured that
$p_3(3,q)=o(q^2)$. We verify this conjecture by proving
$q^{2-o(1)}<p_3(3,q)=o(q^2)$. Our proof can be viewed as an application of

prove this result. These two bounds support a question of Blackburn, Etzion,
Stinson and Zaverucha. Finally, we establish a bridge between perfect hash
families and hypergraph Tur{\'a}n problems. This connection has not been
noticed before. As a consequence, many new results and problems arise.

Naor in 1994 to be used to trace the origin of digital content in traitor
tracing schemes.
  Let $F$ be an alphabet set of size $q$ and $n$ be a positive integer. A
$t$-traceability code is a code $\mathscr{C}\subseteq F^n$ which can be used to
catch at least one colluder from a collusion of at most $t$ traitors. It has
been shown that $t$-traceability codes do not exist for $q\le t$. When $q>t^2$,
$t$-traceability codes with positive code rate can be constructed from error
correcting codes with large minimum distance. Therefore, Barg and Kabatiansky
asked in 2004 that whether there exist $t$-traceability codes with positive
code rate for $t+1\le q\le t^2$. In 2010, Blackburn, Etzion and Ng gave an
affirmative answer to this question for $q\ge t^2-\lceil t/2\rceil+1$, using
the probabilistic methods. However, they did not see how their probabilistic
methods can be used to answer this question for the remaining values of $q$.
They even suspected that there may be a `Plotkin bound' of traceability codes
that forbids the existence of such codes. In this paper, we give a complete
answer to Barg-Kabatiansky's question (in the affirmative). Surprisingly, our
construction is deterministic.

electron bunches with linear energy chirp generated from a laser wakefield

back of the drive laser, it is deflected and stretched along the direction of
the electric field of the laser. Upon exiting the plasma, if the bunch goes
through a narrow slit in front of the dipole magnet that disperses the
electrons in the plane of the laser polarization, it can form a series of
bunchlets that have different energies but are separated by half a laser
wavelength. Since only the electrons that are undeflected by the laser go
through the slit, the energy spectrum of the bunch is modulated. By analyzing
the modulated energy spectrum, the shots where the bunch has a linear energy
chirp can be recognized. Consequently, the energy chirp and beam current
profile of those bunches can be reconstructed. This method is demonstrated
through particle-in-cell simulations and experiment.

the problem requires unbounded memory, and thus, it is intractable. To make the
problem feasible, we introduce the notion of time-dependent similarity: the
similarity of two items decreases with the difference in their arrival time. By
leveraging the properties of this time-dependent similarity function, we design
two algorithmic frameworks to solve the sssj problem. The first one, MiniBatch
(MB), uses existing index-based filtering techniques for the static version of
the problem, and combines them in a pipeline. The second framework, Streaming

time-based bounds deeply in the working of the algorithms. We also introduce a
new indexing technique (L2), which is based on an existing state-of-the-art
indexing technique (L2AP), but is optimized for the streaming case. Extensive
experiments show that the STR algorithm, when instantiated with the L2 index,
is the most scalable option across a wide array of datasets and parameters.

surface scattering of electrons in combination with the effect of quantization
due to size (QSE) impact the evolution of the LSPRs with the size of these
nanosystems. Two key parameters are the length $R_0$ giving the strength of the
QSE and the velocity $\beta_T$ of the electronic excitations entering in the
length scale for diffuse surface scattering. While the QSE itself only produces
a blueshift in energy of the LSPRs, the diffuse surface scattering mechanism
gives to both energy and linewidth an oscillatory-damped behavior as a function
of size, with characteristic lengths that depend on material parameters. Thus,
the evolution of the LSPRs with size at the nanometer scale is very dependent
on the relation of size to these lengths, which we illustrate with several
examples. The variety of behaviors we find could be useful for designing
plasmonic devices based on doped semiconductor nano structures having desired

study the effect produced by a small misalignment between the angular momentum
of the system and its angular velocity. To this end, a precession model is
developed and considered, assuming that the bar behaves like a rigid body.
After checking that the periodic orbits inside the bar keep being the skeleton
of the inner system, even after inflicting a precession to the potential, we
compute the invariant manifolds of the unstable periodic orbits departing from
the equilibrium points at the ends of the bar to get evidences of their warped
shapes. As it is well known, the invariant manifolds associated with these
periodic orbits drive the arms and rings of barred galaxies and constitute the
skeleton of these building blocks. Looking at them from a side-on viewpoint, we
find that these manifolds present warped shapes as those recognized in
observations. Lastly, test particle simulations have been performed to
determine how the stars are affected by the applied precession, confirming this

informational paradigm is entering the domain of quantum field theory,
suggesting a quantum automata framework that can be regarded as an extension of
quantum field theory to including an hypothetical Planck scale, and with the
usual quantum field theory recovered in the relativistic limit of small
wave-vectors. Being derived from simple principles (linearity, unitarity,
locality, homogeneity, isotropy, and minimality of dimension), the automata
theory is quantum ab-initio, and does not assume Lorentz covariance and
mechanical notions. Being discrete it can describe localized states and
measurements (unmanageable by quantum field theory), solving all the issues
plaguing field theory originated from the continuum. These features make the
theory an ideal framework for quantum gravity, with relativistic covariance and
space-time emergent solely from the interactions, and not assumed a priori. The
paper presents a synthetic derivation of the automata theory, showing how from
the principles lead to a description in terms of a quantum automaton over a
Cayley graph of a group. Restricting to Abelian groups we show how the automata
recover the Weyl, Dirac and Maxwell dynamics in the relativistic limit. We
conclude with some new routes about the more general scenario of non-Abelian
Cayley graphs.

frequencies with high resolution. This star is bright enough for complementary
interferometry and time-resolved spectroscopy. Four BRITE satellites observed
$\alpha$ Cir for 146 d or 33 rotational cycles. Phasing the photometry
according to the 4.4790 d rotational period reveals qualitatively different
light variations in the two photometric bands. The phased red-band photometry
is in good agreement with previously-published WIRE data, showing a light curve
symmetric about phase 0.5 with a strong contribution from the first harmonic.
The phased blue-band data, in contrast, show an essentially sinusoidal
variation. We model both light curves with Bayesian Photometric Imaging, which
suggests the presence of two large-scale, photometrically bright (relative to
the surrounding photosphere) spots. We also examine the high-frequency
pulsation spectrum as encoded in the BRITE photometry. Our analysis establishes
the stability of the main pulsation frequency over the last 20 years, confirms
the presence of frequency f7, which was not detected (or the mode not excited)

Health varies over time, and survival is the most basic aspect of health, so

a range of variables may be measured; some constant in time, others not; some
regarded as responses, others as explanatory risk factors; some directly and

classifying variables that may arise in such a setting, emphasizing in
particular, the mathematical distinction between vital and non-vital variables.
We examine also various types of probabilistic relationships that may exist
among variables. Independent evolution is an asymmetric relation, which is
intended to encapsulate the notion of one process driving the other; $X$~is a
driver of~$Y$ if $X$ evolves independently of the history of~$Y$. This concept

evolution of the state (reached following the quench) governed by the final
time-independent Hamiltonian. In the case of sufficiently slow quenching (when
$\tau$ exceeds a critical value $\tau_1$), we show that DPTs, of the form
similar to those occurring for quenching across an isolated critical point, can
occur even when the system is slowly driven across more than one critical point
and gapless phases. More interestingly, in the anisotropic situation we show
that DPTs can completely disappear for some values of the anisotropy term
($\gamma$) and $\tau$, thereby establishing the existence of boundaries in the
$(\gamma-\tau)$ plane between the DPT and no-DPT regions in both isotropic and
anisotropic cases. Our study therefore leads to a unique situation when DPTs
may not occur even when an integrable model is slowly ramped across a QCP. On
the other hand, considering sudden quenches from an initial value $\lambda_i$
to a final value $\lambda_f$, we show that the condition for the presence of
DPTs is governed by relations involving $\lambda_i$, $\lambda_f$ and $\gamma$
and the spin chain must be swept across $\lambda=0$ for DPTs to occur.

beneath the solar surface. The relative magnitude of the radial shear is almost
constant with latitude. This rotational state can be interpreted as a
consequence of two conditions characteristic of the near-surface convection:
the smallness of convective turnover time in comparison with the rotation
period and absence of a horizontal preferred direction of convection
anisotropy. The latter condition is violated in the presence of a magnetic
field. This raises the question of whether the subphotospheric fields can be
probed with measurements of near-surface rotational shear. The shear is shown
to be weakly sensitive to magnetic fields but can serve as a probe for
sufficiently strong fields of the order of one kilogauss. It is suggested that
the radial differential rotation in extended convective envelopes of red giants

$\nH = |V|$ and size $\mH = |E|$. A transversal in $H$ is a subset of vertices
in $H$ that has a nonempty intersection with every edge of $H$. A vertex hits
an edge if it belongs to that edge. The transversal game played on $H$ involves
of two players, \emph{Edge-hitter} and \emph{Staller}, who take turns choosing
a vertex from $H$. Each vertex chosen must hit at least one edge not hit by the
vertices previously chosen. The game ends when the set of vertices chosen
becomes a transversal in $H$. Edge-hitter wishes to minimize the number of
vertices chosen in the game, while Staller wishes to maximize it. The
\emph{game transversal number}, $\tau_g(H)$, of $H$ is the number of vertices
chosen when Edge-hitter starts the game and both players play optimally. We
compare the game transversal number of a hypergraph with its transversal

small fraction of the total number of measured data points. The effects of
changing the wavenumber, the internal source surface and the (noisy) acoustic

root mean square (rms) spectra of GRS 1915+105 in its heartbeat oscillation
class/$\rho$ state show peculiar behaviour at the fundamental and harmonic
frequencies where the lags at the fundamental show a turn around at $\sim$ 10
keV while the lags at the harmonic do not show any turn around at least till
$\sim$ 20 keV. The magnitude of lags are of the order of few seconds and hence
cannot be attributed to the light travel time effects or Comptonization delays.
The continuum X-ray spectra can roughly be described by a disk blackbody and a
hard X-ray power-law component and from phase resolved spectroscopy it has been
shown that the inner disk radius varies during the oscillation. Here, we
propose that there is a delayed response of the inner disk radius (DROID) to
the accretion rate such that $r_{in}(t)\propto \dot{m}^\beta (t-\tau_d)$. The
fluctuating accretion rate drives the oscillations of the inner radius after a
time delay $\tau_d$ while the power-law component responds immediately. We show
that in such a scenario a pure sinusoidal oscillation of the accretion rate can
explain not only the shape and magnitude of energy dependent rms and time-lag
spectra at the fundamental but also the next harmonic with just four free
parameters.

how to derive the two-time Green's function for the time-dependent problem in

the adiabatic evolution problem in quantum mechanics. With such ""adiabatic

weight as the coupling is gradually tuned to zero. Time-dependent
generalization of a related model, the spin-boson Hamiltonian, is analyzed in
the same way. In both cases the sidebands arising from the fermion-boson

that the population shows larger diversity than has been assumed in the past.
The reasons (e.g. parent population, explosion mechanism) for this diversity
remain largely unknown. We have investigated a sample of SNe\,Ia near-infrared
light curves and have correlated the phase of the second maximum with the
bolometric peak luminosity. The peak bolometric luminosity is related to the
time of the second maximum (relative to the {\it B} light curve maximum) as
follows : $L_{max}(10^{43} erg s^{-1}) = (0.039 \pm 0.004) \times t_2(J)(days)
+ (0.013 \pm 0.106)$.
  $^{56}$Ni masses can be derived from the peak luminosity based on Arnett's
rule, which states that the luminosity at maximum is equal to instantaneous
energy generated by the nickel decay. We check this assumption against recent
radiative-transfer calculations of Chandrasekhar-mass delayed detonation models
and find this assumption is valid to within 10\% in recent radiative-transfer
calculations of Chandrasekhar-mass delayed detonation models.
  The $L_{max}$ vs. $t_2$ relation is applied to a sample of 40 additional
SNe\,Ia with significant reddening ($E(B-V) >$ 0.1 mag) and a reddening-free
bolometric luminosity function of SNe~Ia is established. The method is tested
with the $^{56}$Ni mass measurement from the direct observation of
$\gamma-$rays in the heavily absorbed SN 2014J and found to be fully
consistent.
  Super-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions, in particular SN\,2007if, do not follow
the relations between peak luminosity and second IR maximum. This may point to
an additional energy source contributing at maximum light.
  The luminosity function of SNe\,Ia is constructed and is shown to be
asymmetric with a tail of low-luminosity objects and a rather sharp
high-luminosity cutoff, although it might be influenced by selection effects.

object of interest in recent years. For instance, recent experimental
investigations showed that at high velocity impacts carbon nanotubes can unzip
resulting into graphene nanoribbons. Carbon nanoscrolls (CNS) are among the
structures whose high impact behavior has not yet been investigated. CNS are
graphene membranes rolled up into papyrus-like structures. Their unique
open-ended topology leads to properties not found in close-ended structures,
such as nanotubes. Here we report a fully atomistic reactive molecular dynamics
study on the behavior of CNS colliding at high velocities against solid
targets. Our results show that the velocity and scroll axis orientation are key
parameters to determine the resulting formed nanostructures after impact. The
relative orientation of the scroll open ends and the substrate is also very
important. We observed that for appropriate velocities and orientations, the
nanoscrolls can experience large structural deformations and large-scale
fractures. We have also observed unscrolling (scrolls going back to planar or
quasi-planar graphene membranes), unzip resulting into nanoribbons, and
significant reconstructions from breaking and/or formation of new chemical
bonds. Another interesting result was that if the CNS impact the substrate with
their open ends, for certain velocities, fused scroll walls were observed.

an observation could in principle belong to more than one cluster. In the
context of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) experiments, for example, the
signal observed in the data might be produced by two (or more) different
biological processes operating together and a gene could participate in both

coming from a ChIP-Seq experiment, with a mixture model, allowing each unit to
belong potentially to more than one group: these multiple allocation clusters
can be flexibly defined via a function combining the features of the original
groups without introducing new parameters. The formulation naturally gives rise
to a `zero-inflation group' in which values close to zero can be allocated,
acting as a correction for the abundance of zeros that manifest in this type of
data. We take into account the spatial dependency between observations, which
is described through a latent Conditional Auto-Regressive process that can
reflect different dependency patterns. We assess the performance of our model
within a simulation environment and then we apply it to ChIP-seq real data.

ram pressure stripping or by gravitational perturbations caused by galactic
encounters. New IRAM 30m HERA CO(2-1) data of NGC 4501 and NGC 4567/68 are
presented. We find an increase in the molecular fraction where the ISM is
compressed. The gas is close to self-gravitation in compressed regions. This
leads to an increase in gas pressure and a decrease in the ratio between the
molecular fraction and total ISM pressure. The overall Kennicutt Schmidt
relation based on a pixel-by-pixel analysis at ~1.5 kpc resolution is not
significantly modified by compression. However, we detected continuous regions
of low molecular star formation efficiencies in the compressed parts of the
galactic gas disks. The data suggest that a relation between the molecular star
formation efficiency SFE_H2 and gas self-gravitation exists. Both systems show
spatial variations in the star formation efficiency with respect to the
molecular gas that can be related to environmental compression of the ISM. An
analytical model was used to investigate the dependence of SFE_H2 on
self-gravitation. The model correctly reproduces the correlations between
R_mol/P_tot, SFE_H2, and Toomre Q if different global turbulent velocity
dispersions are assumed for the three galaxies. We found that variations in the
N_H_2/I_CO conversion factor can mask most of the correlation between SFE_H2
and the Q parameter. Dynamical simulations were used to compare the effects of
ram pressure and tidal ISM compression. We conclude that a gravitationally
induced ISM compression has the same consequences as ram pressure compression:
(i) an increasing gas surface density, (ii) an increasing molecular fraction,
and (iii) a decreasing R_mol/P_tot in the compressed region due to the presence
of nearly self-gravitating gas. The response of SFE_H2 to compression is more
complex.

quark-gluon plasma, $\Delta_{B}\equiv dN_{B}/d^{4}xd^{4}q$, is derived from
first principles. The constant magnetic field $B$ is assumed to be aligned in a
fixed spatial direction. It is shown that the anisotropy induced by the $B$
field is mainly reflected in the general structure of photon spectral density
function. This is related to the imaginary part of the vacuum polarization
tensor, $\mbox{Im}[\Pi^{\mu\nu}]$, which is derived in a first order
perturbative approximation. As expected, the final analytical expression for
$\Delta_{B}$ includes a trace over the product of a photonic part,
$\mbox{Im}[\Pi^{\mu\nu}]$, and a leptonic part, ${\cal{L}}_{\mu\nu}$. It is
shown that $\Delta_{B}$ consists of two parts, $\Delta_{B}^{\|}$ and
$\Delta_{B}^{\perp}$, arising from the components $(\mu,\nu)=(\|,\|)$ and
$(\mu,\nu)=(\perp,\perp)$ of $\mbox{Im}[\Pi^{\mu\nu}]$ and
${\cal{L}}_{\mu\nu}$. Here, the transverse and longitudinal directions are
defined with respect to the direction of the $B$ field. Combining
$\Delta_{B}^{\|}$ and $\Delta_{B}^{\perp}$, a novel anisotropy factor $\nu_{B}$
is introduced. Using the final analytical expression of $\Delta_{B}$, the
possible interplay between the temperature $T$ and the magnetic field strength
$eB$ on the ratio $\Delta_{B}/\Delta_{0}$ and $\nu_{B}$ is numerically studied.
Here, $\Delta_{0}$ is the Born approximated dilepton multiplicity in the
absence of external magnetic fields. It is, in particular, shown that for each
fixed $T$ and $B$, in the vicinity of certain threshold energies,
$\Delta_{B}\gg \Delta_{0}$ and $\Delta_{B}^{\perp}\gg \Delta_{B}^{\|}$. The
latter anisotropy may be interpreted as one of the microscopic sources of the
macroscopic anisotropies, reflecting themselves, e.g., in the elliptic
asymmetry factor $v_{2}$ of dileptons.

Assuming time division multiple access (TDMA), we propose a novel transmission
scheme for jointly optimal allocation of the BS broadcasting power and time
sharing among the wireless nodes, which maximizes the overall network
throughput, under the constraint of average transmit power and maximum transmit
power at the BS. The proposed scheme significantly outperforms ""state of the
art"" schemes that employ only the optimal time allocation. If a single EH
transmitter is considered, we generalize the optimal solutions for the case of
fixed circuit power consumption, which refers to a much more practical
scenario.

been studied extensively in the literature, this work sets out to \emph{assess
potential gender inequalities in Wikipedia articles} along different
dimensions: notability, topical focus, linguistic bias, structural properties,
and meta-data presentation.
  We find that (i) women in Wikipedia are more notable than men, which we
interpret as the outcome of a subtle glass ceiling effect; (ii) family-,
gender-, and relationship-related topics are more present in biographies about
women; (iii) linguistic bias manifests in Wikipedia since abstract terms tend
to be used to describe positive aspects in the biographies of men and negative
aspects in the biographies of women; and (iv) there are structural differences
in terms of meta-data and hyperlinks, which have consequences for
information-seeking activities. While some differences are expected, due to
historical and social contexts, other differences are attributable to Wikipedia
editors. The implications of such differences are discussed having Wikipedia
contribution policies in mind. We hope that the present work will contribute to
increased awareness about, first, gender issues in the content of Wikipedia,
and second, the different levels on which gender biases can manifest on the

problem can be formulated as a stochastic control problem with atypical
boundary constraints. This in turn has a fluid dynamic counterpart where the
flow of probability densities represents an entropic interpolation between the
given initial and final marginals. In the zero noise limit, such entropic
interpolation converges in a suitable sense to the displacement interpolation
of optimal mass transport (OMT). We consider two absolutely continuous curves
in Wasserstein space ${\cal W}_2$ and study the evolution of the relative
entropy on ${\cal W}_2\times {\cal W}_2$ on a finite time interval. Thus, this
study differs from previous work in OMT theory concerning relative entropy from
a fixed (often equilibrium) distribution (density). We derive a gradient flow
on Wasserstein product space. We find the remarkable property that fluxes in
the two components are opposite. Plugging in the ""steepest descent"" into the
evolution of the relative entropy we get what appears to be a new formula: The
two flows approach each other at a faster rate than that of two solutions of
the same Fokker-Planck. We then study the evolution of relative entropy in the
case of uncontrolled-controlled diffusions. In two special cases of the
Schroedinger bridge problem, we show that such relative entropy may be
monotonically decreasing or monotonically increasing.

The obtained periods are consistent with those provided by the Fermi/GBM pulsar

the spin-up rate positively correlated with the 2-20 keV flux. We applied the
accretion torque model proposed by Ghosh & Lamb (1979, ApJ, 234, 296) to the
MAXI/GSC data, as well as the past data including both spin-up and spin-down

observed relation between the spin-up/down rate and the flux. By comparing the
model-predicted luminosity with the observed flux, the source distance was
constrained as 5-13 kpc, which is consistent with that by Chakrabarty (1998,
ApJ, 492, 342). Conversely, if the source distance is assumed, the data can
constrain the mass and radius of the neutron star, because the Ghosh & Lamb
model depends on these parameters. We attempted this idea, and found that an
assumed distance of, e.g., 10 kpc gives a mass in the range of 1.81-1.90 solar

experimentally observed with cold gases and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)

counterpropagating and non-interfering lasers of orthogonal polarization. In
contrast to previous works, no spatial light modes are preselected by any
boundary conditions and the transition from homogeneous to periodic order
amounts to a crystallization of both light and ultracold atoms breaking a
continuous translational symmetry. In the crystallized state the BEC acquires a
phase similar to a supersolid with an emergent intrinsic length scale whereas
the light-field forms an optical lattice allowing phononic excitations via
collective back scattering, which are gapped due to the infinte-range

provides a conceptually motivated procedure to compute the meaning of
sentences, given grammatical structure and the meanings of its words. This
approach has outperformed other models in mainstream empirical language
processing tasks. However, until recently it has lacked the crucial feature of
lexical entailment -- as do other distributional models of meaning.
  In this paper we solve the problem of entailment for categorical
compositional distributional semantics. Taking advantage of the abstract
categorical framework allows us to vary our choice of model. This enables the
introduction of a notion of entailment, exploiting ideas from the categorical
semantics of partial knowledge in quantum computation.
  The new model of language uses density matrices, on which we introduce a
novel robust graded order capturing the entailment strength between concepts.
This graded measure emerges from a general framework for approximate
entailment, induced by any commutative monoid. Quantum logic embeds in our
graded order.
  Our main theorem shows that entailment strength lifts compositionally to the
sentence level, giving a lower bound on sentence entailment. We describe the
essential properties of graded entailment such as continuity, and provide a
procedure for calculating entailment strength.

accompanied by a reliable means to characterize the efficiency of that process
is needed in the study of correlated photon pairs and entangled states
involving more than three photons, which have important potential applications
in quantum information and quantum communication. In this study, we report the
first characterization of the efficiency of generation of correlated photon
pairs emitted from a CuCl single crystal using the biexciton-resonance
hyper-parametric scattering (RHPS) method which is the highly efficient method
of generation of correlated photon pairs. In order to characterize the
generation efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio of correlated photon pairs
using this method, we investigated the excitation density dependence on the
photon counting rate and coincidence counting rate under resonant excitation.
The excitation density dependence shows that the power characteristics of the
photon counting rates changes from linear to quadratic dependence of the
excitation density. This behavior represents a superposition of contributions
from correlated photon pairs and non-correlated photons. Photon counting
signals in this study were recorded as time-tag data, which provide the photon
counting rate and coincidence counting rate simultaneously, and improve the
coincidence counting rate by the factor of 200 compared to that obtained in
previous work [K. Edamatsu $\it{et\ al}$. Nature $\bf{431}$, 167-170 (2004)].
The analysis of the excitation density dependence shows that one photon-pair is
produced by a pump pulse with $2 \times 10^6$ photons. Moreover, the generation

include no magnetic cations is an unsolved puzzle. Progress has been hampered
both by the irreproducibility of much of the experimental data, and the lack of
any generally-accepted theoretical explanation. The characteristic signature is
a virtually anhysteretic, temperature-independent magnetization curve which
saturates in an applied field that is several orders of magnitude greater than
the magnetization. It appears as if a tiny volume fraction, < 0.1%, of the
samples is magnetic and that the energy scale of the problem is unusually high
for spin magnetism. Here we investigate the effect of dispersing 4 nm CeO2
nanoparticles with powders of gamma-Al2O3, sugar or latex microspheres. The
saturation magnetization, Ms ~ 60 A/m for compact samples, is maximized by 1
wt% lanthanum doping. Dispersing the CeO2 nanopowder reduces its magnetic
moment by up to an order of magnitude. There is a characteristic length scale
of order 100 nm for the magnetism to appear in CeO2 nanoparticle clusters. The
phenomenon is explained in terms of a giant orbital paramagnetism that appears
in coherent mesoscopic domains due to resonant interaction with zero-point
fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field. The theory explains the
observed temperature-independent magnetization curve and its doping and
dispersion dependence, based on a length scale of 300 nm that corresponds to
the wavelength of a maximum in the UV absorption spectrum of the magnetic CeO2

correlators, the free-energy and those of instanton corrections can be obtained
from the spectral curve of the resolvent operator. However, at the level of
non-perturbative completion, the resolvent operator is generally not sufficient
to recover all the information from the loop equations. Therefore it is
necessary to find a sufficient set of operators which provide the missing
non-perturbative information. In this paper, we study generalized Wronskians of
the Baker-Akhiezer systems as a manifestation of these new degrees of freedom.
In particular, we derive their isomonodromy systems and then extend several
spectral dualities to these systems. In addition, we discuss how these
Wronskian operators are naturally aligned on the Kac table. Since they are
consistent with the Seiberg-Shih relation, we propose that these new degrees of
freedom can be identified as FZZT-Cardy branes in Liouville theory. This means
that FZZT-Cardy branes are the bound states of elemental FZZT branes (i.e. the
twisted fermions) rather than the bound states of principal FZZT-brane (i.e.
the resolvent operator).

  of ESA 2016",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The minimum unsatisfiability version of a constraint satisfaction problem
(MinCSP) asks for an assignment where the number of unsatisfied constraints is
minimum possible, or equivalently, asks for a minimum-size set of constraints
whose deletion makes the instance satisfiable. For a finite set $\Gamma$ of
constraints, we denote by MinCSP($\Gamma$) the restriction of the problem where
each constraint is from $\Gamma$. The polynomial-time solvability and the
polynomial-time approximability of MinCSP($\Gamma$) were fully characterized by
Khanna et al. [Siam J. Comput. '00]. Here we study the fixed-parameter (FP-)
approximability of the problem: given an instance and an integer $k$, one has
to find a solution of size at most $g(k)$ in time $f(k)n^{O(1)}$ if a solution
of size at most $k$ exists. We especially focus on the case of constant-factor
FP-approximability. We show the following dichotomy: for each finite constraint
language $\Gamma$, either we exhibit a constant-factor FP-approximation for
MinCSP($\Gamma$); or we prove that MinCSP($\Gamma$) has no constant-factor
FP-approximation unless FPT$=$W[1]. In particular, we show that approximating
the so-called Nearest Codeword within some constant factor is W[1]-hard.
Recently, Arnab et al. [ICALP '18] showed that such a W[1]-hardness of
approximation implies that Even Set is W[1]-hard under randomized reductions.
Combining our results, we therefore settle the parameterized complexity of Even
Set, a famous open question in the field.

due to the absence of any of the cancellations afforded by incompressibility,

$P$ and the SM particles as well as a coupling between $A$ and the vector-like
fermions. Such a mixing and couplings are strongly constrained by
$\tau\to\mu\gamma$, muon g-2 and the 750 GeV diphoton data. We scan over the
parameter space and find that such an extension can simultaneously account for
the observed excesses of 750 GeV diphoton, muon g-2 and $h\to \mu\tau$. The 750
GeV resonance decays in exotic modes, such as $P\to hA$, $P\to HZ$, $P\to HA$
and $P\to W^\pm H^\mp$, and its width can be dozens of GeV and is sensitive to
the mixing angle.

New X-ray observations of Ap/Bp stars are presented and combined with an

type that is currently available. In the studied stars the X-ray detections are
found predominantly among the more massive, hotter and more luminous targets.
Their X-ray properties are quite diverse and beside strong soft X-ray emission
significant magnetic activity is frequently present. While a connection between
more powerful winds and brighter X-ray emission is expected in intrinsic
models, the scatter in X-ray luminosity at given bolometric luminosity is so
far unexplained and several observational features like X-ray light curves and
flaring, luminosity distributions and spectral properties are often similar to
those of low-mass stars. It remains to be seen if these features can be fully
reproduced by magnetospheres of intermediate mass stars. The article discusses
implications for magnetically confined wind-shock models (MCWS) and stellar
magnetospheres under the assumption that the intrinsic model is applicable, but
also examines the role of possible companions. Further, related magnetospheric
phenomena are presented and an outlook on future perspectives is given.

  March 2019",,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Decreasing transistor sizes and lower voltage swings cause two distinct
problems for communication in integrated circuits. First, decreasing inter-wire
spacing increases interline capacitive coupling, which adversely affects
transmission energy and delay. Second, lower voltage swings render the
transmission susceptible to various noise sources. Coding can be used to
address both these problems. So-called crosstalk-avoidance codes mitigate
capacitive coupling, and traditional error-correction codes introduce
resilience against channel errors.
  Unfortunately, crosstalk-avoidance and error-correction codes cannot be
combined in a straightforward manner. On the one hand, crosstalk-avoidance
encoding followed by error-correction encoding destroys the crosstalk-avoidance
property. On the other hand, error-correction encoding followed by
crosstalk-avoidance encoding causes the crosstalk-avoidance decoder to fail in
the presence of errors. Existing approaches circumvent this difficulty by using
additional bus wires to protect the parities generated from the output of the
error-correction encoder, and are therefore inefficient.
  In this work we propose a novel joint crosstalk-avoidance and
error-correction coding and decoding scheme that provides higher bus
transmission rates compared to existing approaches. Our joint approach
carefully embeds the parities such that the crosstalk-avoidance property is
preserved. We analyze the rate and minimum distance of the proposed scheme. We
also provide a density evolution analysis and predict iterative decoding
thresholds for reliable communication under random bus erasures. This density
evolution analysis is nonstandard, since the crosstalk-avoidance constraints
are inherently nonlinear.
