feedback, adopting a formulation that allows for the reward function to vary
with time. We model the reward function using a Gaussian process whose
evolution obeys a simple Markov model. We introduce two natural extensions of
the classical Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) algorithm. The
first, R-GP-UCB, resets GP-UCB at regular intervals. The second, TV-GP-UCB,
instead forgets about old data in a smooth fashion. Our main contribution
comprises of novel regret bounds for these algorithms, providing an explicit
characterization of the trade-off between the time horizon and the rate at
which the function varies. We illustrate the performance of the algorithms on
both synthetic and real data, and we find the gradual forgetting of TV-GP-UCB
to perform favorably compared to the sharp resetting of R-GP-UCB. Moreover,
both algorithms significantly outperform classical GP-UCB, since it treats
stale and fresh data equally.

  Audio Signal Processing",,,,,"cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many audio applications rely on filter banks (FBs) to analyze, process, and
re-synthesize sounds. To approximate the auditory frequency resolution in the
signal chain, some applications rely on perceptually motivated FBs, the
gammatone FB being a popular example. However, most perceptually motivated FBs
only allow partial signal reconstruction at high redundancies and/or do not
have good resistance to sub-channel processing. This paper introduces an
oversampled perceptually motivated FB enabling perfect reconstruction,
efficient FB design, and adaptable redundancy. The filters are directly
constructed in the frequency domain and linearly distributed on a perceptual
frequency scale (e.g. ERB, Bark, or Mel scale). The proposed design allows for
various filter shapes, uniform or non-uniform FB setting, and large
down-sampling factors. For redundancies $\geq$ 3 perfect reconstruction is
achieved by computing the canonical dual FB analytically. For lower
redundancies perfect reconstruction is achieved using an iterative method.
Experiments show performance improvements of the proposed approach when
compared to the gammatone FB in terms of reconstruction error and resistance to
sub-channel processing, especially at low redundancies.

dominant processes in low-energy collisions of two heavy nuclei. They are
expected to be useful to produce neutron-rich unstable nuclei. Nuclear dynamics
leading to these processes depends sensitively on nuclear properties such as
deformation and shell structure. Purpose: We elucidate reaction mechanisms of
MNT and QF processes involving heavy deformed nuclei, making detailed
comparisons between microscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) calculations
and measurements for the $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction. Methods:
Three-dimensional Skyrme-TDHF calculations are performed. Particle-number
projection method is used to evaluate MNT cross sections from the TDHF wave
function after collision. Results: Fragment masses, total kinetic energy (TKE),
scattering angle, contact time, and MNT cross sections are investigated for the
$^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction. They show reasonable agreements with
measurements. At small impact parameters, collision dynamics depends
sensitively on the orientation of deformed $^{238}$U. In tip (side) collisions,
we find a larger (smaller) TKE and a shorter (longer) contact time. In tip
collisions, we find a strong influence of quantum shells around $^{208}$Pb.
Conclusions: It is confirmed that the TDHF calculations reasonably describe
both MNT and QF processes in the $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction. Analyses of this
system indicates the significance of the nuclear structure effects such as
deformation and quantum shells in nuclear reaction dynamics at low energies.

understanding of the renormalisation group and the geometry of the space of
QFTs. Here, we review the parallel developments of the search for a
higher-dimensional generalisation of the c-theorem and of the Local
Renormalisation Group.
  The idea of renormalisation with position-dependent couplings, running under
local Weyl scaling, is traced from its early realisations to the elegant modern
formalism of the local renormalisation group. The key role of the associated
Weyl consistency conditions in establishing RG flow equations for the
coefficients of the trace anomaly in curved spacetime, and their relation to
the c-theorem and four-dimensional a-theorem, is explained in detail.
  A number of different derivations of the c-theorem in two dimensions are
presented -- using spectral functions, RG analysis of Green functions of the
energy-momentum tensor T_{mu nu}, and dispersion relations -- and are
generalised to four dimensions. The obstruction to establishing monotonic
C-functions related to the beta_c and beta_b trace anomaly coefficients in four
dimensions is discussed. The possibility of deriving an a-theorem, involving
the coefficient beta_a of the Euler-Gauss-Bonnet density in the trace anomaly,
is explored initially by formulating the QFT on maximally symmetric spaces.
Then the formulation of the weak a-theorem using a dispersion relation for
four-point functions of T^mu_mu is presented.
  Finally, we describe the application of the local renormalisation group to
the issue of limit cycles in theories with a global symmetry and it is shown
how this sheds new light on the geometry of the space of couplings in QFT.

possible: a) making every device dual stack, b) translation, c) tunneling.
Tunneling stands out as the best possible solution. Among the IPv6 tunneling
techniques, this paper evaluates the impact of three recent IPv6 tunneling
techniques: 6to4, Teredo, and ISATAP, in cloud virtualization environment. In
virtual networks, these protocols were implemented on Microsoft Windows (MS
Windows 7 and MS Windows Server 2008) and Linux operating system. Each protocol
was implemented on the virtual network. UDP audio streaming, video streaming

and final results. The performance of these tunneling techniques has been
evaluated on eight parameters, namely: throughput, end to end delay (E2ED),
jitter, round trip time (RTT), tunneling overhead, tunnel setup delay, query
delay, and auxiliary devices required. This evaluation shows the impact of

eavesdrops through a broadcast channel summons one of the parties in a
communication protocol to reveal their message (or signal vector). It is
desirable that the summoned party have enough freedom to produce a fake output
that is likely plausible given the eavesdropper's observation. We examine three
variants of this problem -- Message Deniability, Transmitter Deniability, and
Receiver Deniability. In the first setting, the message sender is summoned to
produce the sent message. Similarly, in the second and third settings, the
transmitter and the receiver are required to produce the transmitted codeword,
and the received vector respectively. For each of these settings, we examine
the maximum communication rate that allows a given minimum rate of plausible
fake outputs. For the Message and Transmitter Deniability problems, we fully
characterise the capacity region for general broadcast channels, while for the
Receiver Deniability problem, we give an achievable rate region for physically
degraded broadcast channels.

major source of decoherence. Low frequency nuclear noise, responsible for fast

small-scale MIMO based architecture, even if the latter employs the

to the conventional small-scale MIMO system, the effective system throughput of
the proposed LS-MIMO based scheme is increased by a factor of up to three and
the quality of reconstructed video quantified in terms of the peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is improved by about $22.5\, \text{dB}$ at a
channel-SNR of $E_b/N_0 \approx 6\,\text{dB}$ for delay-tolerant video-file

improvement from a power-saving perspective, a channel-SNR gain as high as
$\Delta_{E_b/N_0}\approx 5\,\text{dB}$ is observed at a PSNR of $36\,
\text{dB}$ for the scenario of delay-tolerant video applications and again, an
even higher gain is achieved in the real-time video application scenario.
Therefore, we envisage that LS-MIMO aided wireless multimedia communications is
capable of dispensing with power-thirsty channel codec altogether!

Artin-Schelter regular of global dimension n. Both these classes of Hopf

satisfies a polynomial identity only if it is a commutative polynomial algebra.

that represent real objects with noisy data. To account for noise, we relax the
definition of similarity using the maximum weighted co-$k$-plex relaxation
method, which allows dissimilarities among graphs up to a predetermined level.
We then formulate the problem as a novel quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization problem that can be solved by a quantum annealer. The context of
our study is molecular similarity where the presence of noise might be due to
regular errors in measuring molecular features. We develop a similarity measure
and use it to predict the mutagenicity of a molecule. Our results indicate that
the relaxed similarity measure, designed to accommodate the regular errors,
yields a higher prediction accuracy than the measure that ignores the noise.

predictions from advanced computational models, a problem of fundamental
importance is the quantification and reduction of uncertainties in both model
inputs and output data. The typical work-flow in the end-to-end quantification
of uncertainties requires first formulating and solving stochastic inverse
problems (SIPs) using output data on available quantities of interest (QoI).
The solution to a SIP is often written in terms of a probability measure, or
density, on the space of model inputs. Then, we can formulate and solve a
stochastic forward problem (SFP) where the uncertainty on model inputs is
propagated through the model to make quantitative predictions on either
unobservable or future QoI data.
  In this work, we use a measure-theoretic framework to formulate and solve
both SIPs and SFPs. From this perspective, we quantify the geometric
characteristics of using hypothetical sets of QoI that describe both the
precision and accuracy in solutions to both the SIP and SFP. This leads to a
natural definition of the optimal experimental design, i.e., what the optimal
configuration a finite set of sensors is in space-time. Several numerical
examples and applications are discussed including the ADvanced CIRCulation
(ADCIRC) model using simulated data from Hurricane Gustav to determine an
optimal placement of buoys in the Gulf of Mexico to capture high water marks of
the storm surge in order to reduce uncertainties in bottom roughness
characteristics.

oscillators with an extra internal phase through which they are coupled to a
mean-field of oppositely moving bacteria. Previously, patterns for this model
were obtained only by numerical methods and it was not possible to find their
wavenumber analytically. We derive an evolution equation for the reversal point
density that selects the pattern wavenumber in the weak signaling limit, show
the validity of the selection rule by solving numerically the model equations

answer this question, one needs a quality score that utilizes both structure
and attributes. Popular existing measures either quantify the structure only
and ignore the attributes (e.g., conductance), or only consider the
connectedness of the nodes inside the neighborhood and ignore the cross-edges
at the boundary (e.g., density).
  In this work we propose normality, a new quality measure for attributed
neighborhoods. Normality utilizes structure and attributes together to quantify
both internal consistency and external separability. It exhibits two key
advantages over other measures: (1) It allows many boundary-edges as long as
they can be ""exonerated""; i.e., either (i) are expected under a null model,
and/or (ii) the boundary nodes do not exhibit the subset of attributes shared
by the neighborhood members. Existing measures, in contrast, penalize boundary
edges irrespectively. (2) Normality can be efficiently maximized to
automatically infer the shared attribute subspace (and respective weights) that
characterize a neighborhood. This efficient optimization allows us to process
graphs with millions of attributes.
  We capitalize on our measure to present a novel approach for Anomaly Mining
of Entity Neighborhoods (AMEN). Experiments on real-world attributed graphs
illustrate the effectiveness of our measure at anomaly detection, outperforming
popular approaches including conductance, density, OddBall, and SODA. In
addition to anomaly detection, our qualitative analysis demonstrates the
utility of normality as a powerful tool to contrast the correlation between

strongly non-equilibrium conditions (similar formulas are expected for phonons
and photons). Importantly, the special treatment proposed by us may be extended
to higher order terms in order to address a variety of problems related to
nonlinear thermal and electro-thermal effects which may occur at nanoscale.

(SEDs) of ionized winds is considered. The goal is to emphasize distinctions
between microclumping and macroclumping effects. Microclumping can alter SED
slopes and flux levels if the volume filling factor of the clumps varies with
radius; however, the modifications are independent of the clump geometry. To
what extent does macroclumping alter SED slopes and flux levels? In addressing
the question, two specific types of macroclump geometries are explored: shell
fragments (""pancake""-shaped) and spherical clumps. Analytic and semi-analytic
results are derived in the limiting case that clumps never obscure one another.
Numerical calculations based on a porosity formalism is used when clumps do
overlap. Under the assumptions of a constant expansion, isothermal, and fixed
ionization wind, the fragment model leads to results that are essentially
identical to the microclumping result. Mass-loss rate determinations are not
affected by porosity effects for shell fragments. By contrast, spherical clumps
can lead to a reduction in long-wavelength fluxes, but the reductions are only
significant for extreme volume filling factors.

paper we present a generalization of quasilinear theory to include dynamic mode
interactions on the large scales. This generalized quasilinear (GQL)
approximation is achieved by separating the state variables into large and
small zonal scales via a spectral filter rather than by a decomposition into a
formal mean and fluctuations. Nonlinear interactions involving only small zonal
scales are then removed. The approximation is conservative and allows for
scattering of energy between small-scale modes via the large scale (through
non-local spectral interactions). We evaluate GQL for the paradigmatic problems
of the driving of large-scale jets on a spherical surface and on the beta-plane
and show that it is accurate even for a small number of large-scale modes. As
this approximation is formally linear in the small zonal scales it allows for
the closure of the system and can be utilized in direct statistical simulation
schemes that have proved an attractive alternative to direct numerical
simulation for many geophysical and astrophysical problems.

resiliency, as well as potential solutions to the challenges. Study of systems
as multi-genre networks is relatively uncommon; instead, it is customary in
research and engineering literature to focus on a view of a network comprised
of homogeneous elements, (e.g., a network of communication devices, or a
network of social beings). Yet, most if not all real-world networks are
multi-genre - it is hard to find any real system of a significant complexity
that does not include a combination of interconnected physical elements,
communication devices and channels, data collections, and human users forming
an integrated, inter-dependent whole. Most approaches to improving resiliency
and robustness involve compromises, and the key challenge is to find a
favorable compromise. Such compromises involve reducing or managing the
complexity of the network: coupling, rigidity and dependency. We discuss
several of these compromises, e.g., performance vs resiliency; resiliency to
one type of disruption vs resiliency to another disruption type; and complexity

Ricci scalar and its first and second derivatives. Extracting the field
equations we obtain an effective dark energy sector that consists of both extra
scalar degrees of freedom, and we determine various observables. We analyze two
specific models and we obtain a cosmological behavior in agreement with
observations, i.e. transition from matter to dark energy era, with the onset of
cosmic acceleration. Additionally, for a particular range of the model
parameters, the equation-of-state parameter of the effective dark energy sector
can exhibit the phantom-divide crossing. These features reveal the capabilities
of these theories, since they arise solely from the novel, higher-derivative

self-adjoint Hamiltonians. This mapping depends on both the position-dependent
mass and on a function of position satisfying a condition that assures the
existence of a consistent continuity equation. We identify the non self-adjoint
Hamiltonians here studied to a very general family of Hamiltonians proposed in
a seminal article of Harrison [1] to describe varying band structures in
different types of metals. Therefore, we have self-adjoint Hamiltonians that
correspond to the non self-adjoint ones found in Harrison's article. We analyze
three typical cases by choosing a physical position-dependent mass and a
deformed harmonic oscillator potential . We completely solve the Schrodinger

the invariant set of an iterated function system or IFS. In the one dimensional
case, our methods require only C^3 regularity of the maps in the IFS. The key
idea, which has been known in varying degrees of generality for many years, is
to associate to the IFS a parametrized family of positive, linear,
Perron-Frobenius operators L_s. The operators L_s can typically be studied in
many different Banach spaces. Here, unlike most of the literature, we study L_s
in a Banach space of real-valued, C^k functions, k >= 2; and we note that L_s
is not compact, but has a strictly positive eigenfunction v_s with positive
eigenvalue lambda_s equal to the spectral radius of L_s. Under appropriate
assumptions on the IFS, the Hausdorff dimension of the invariant set of the IFS
is the value s=s_* for which lambda_s =1. This eigenvalue problem is then
approximated by a collocation method using continuous piecewise linear
functions (in one dimension) or bilinear functions (in two dimensions). Using
the theory of positive linear operators and explicit a priori bounds on the
derivatives of the strictly positive eigenfunction v_s, we give rigorous upper
and lower bounds for the Hausdorff dimension s_*, and these bounds converge to
s_* as the mesh size approaches zero.

medical studies, as it can provide insights about why an intervention works and

mediation methods focus on mediation effects defined on a mean scale. However,
in health-risk studies, such as alcohol or risky sex, outcomes are typically
count data and heavily skewed. Thus, mediation effects in these setting would
be natural on a rate ratio scale, such as in Poisson and negative binomial
regression methods. Existing methods also mainly rely on the assumption of no
unmeasured confounding between mediator and outcome. To allow for potential
confounders between the mediator and outcome, we define the direct and mediator
effects on a new scale and propose a multiplicative structural mean model for
mediation analysis with count outcomes. The estimator is compared with both
Poisson and negative binomial regression methods assuming sequential
ignorability using a simulation study and a real world example about an
alcohol-related intervention study. Mediation analyses using the new methods
confirm the study hypothesis that the intervention decreases drinking by
decreasing individual's normative perceptions of alcohol use.

quaternion/octonion algebra and Jordan algebra over finite rings Z_n and are
secure in the weak ciphertext-only security model assuming the hardness of

fully-integrated evanescent opto-nanomechanical transducer based on a
high-stress Si$_3$N$_4$ nanobeam monolithically suspended above a SiO$_2$

planarized sacrificial layers, we achieve beam-disk gaps as little as 25 nm

$Q\sim10^7$. The combined low loss, small gap, and parallel-plane geometry
result in exceptionally efficient transduction, characterizing by
radio-frequency flexural modes with vacuum optomechanical coupling rates of 100
kHz, single-photon cooperativities in excess of unity, and zero-point frequency
(displacement) noise amplitudes of 10 kHz (fm)/$\surd$Hz. In conjunction with
the high power handling capacity of SiO$_2$ and low extraneous substrate noise,
the transducer operates particularly well as a sensor. Deploying it in a 4 K

stars in globular clusters are sensitive probes of their original helium
abundances. However, recent analyses based on visual and near-ultraviolet (UV)
CMDs have provided conflicting results. To clarify the situation, we address
the optimum ranges of applicability (in terms of the $T_{eff}$ range covered by
the HB stars) for visual and near-UV CMDs, as far as application of this HB $Y$
test goes. We consider both Stromgren and Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
bandpasses. Our results indicate that the distributions of HB stars in the y vs
(b-y) plane can be a reliable indicator of the He content in cool blue HB (BHB)
stars, particularly when a differential comparison between blue and red HB
stars is carried out in the range $T_{eff}<8300$K. Conversely, we demonstrate
that CMDs using the F336W filter have a much less straightforward
interpretation at the cool end of the BHB, as the distributions of HB stars in
the F336W vs (F336W-F555W) plane are affected by a triple degeneracy effect. In
other words, the position of an HB star is exactly the same, for a given
chemical composition, for multiple combinations of the parameters $Y$,
$M_{HB}$, and age along the HB evolutionary track. Other HST UV filters do not
appear to be as severely affected by this degeneracy effect, to which visual
bandpasses are also immune. We do find, on the other hand, that such near-UV
CMDs can be extremely useful for the hottest stars along the cool BHB end.
Based on a reanalysis of the distribution of HB stars in the y vs (b-y) plane,
we find that the coolest among the BHB stars in M3 are likely enhanced in
helium by $\Delta Y\approx 0.01$, compared with the red HB stars in the same
cluster. Using near-UV HST photometry we find evidence of a progressive
increase in $Y$ with increasing temperature, reaching $\Delta Y=0.02$ at
$T_{eff}=10900$K.

while a bitrate that is too low leads to poor video quality. Video providers
segment videos into short segments and encode each segment at multiple
bitrates. The video player adaptively chooses the bitrate of each segment to
download, possibly choosing different bitrates for successive segments. We
formulate bitrate adaptation as a utility-maximization problem and devise an
online control algorithm called BOLA that uses Lyapunov optimization to
minimize rebuffering and maximize video quality. We prove that BOLA achieves a
time-average utility that is within an additive term O(1/V) of the optimal
value, for a control parameter V related to the video buffer size. Further,
unlike prior work, BOLA does not require prediction of available network
bandwidth. We empirically validate BOLA in a simulated network environment

combination of smoothness (L2 norm-based) and sparseness (L1 norm-based)
constraints is a flexible approach that have been pursued by important examples
such as the Elastic Net (ENET) and mixed-norm (MXN) models. The former is used
to find solutions with a small number of smooth non-zero patches, while the
latter imposes sparseness and smoothness simultaneously along different
dimensions of the spatio-temporal matrix solutions. Both models have been
addressed within the penalized regression approach, where the regularization
parameters are selected heuristically, leading usually to non-optimal
solutions. The existing Bayesian formulation of ENET allows hyperparameter
learning, but using computationally intensive Monte Carlo/Expectation
Maximization methods. In this work we attempt to solve the EEG IP using a
Bayesian framework for models based on mixtures of L1/L2 norms penalization
functions (Laplace/Normal priors) such as ENET and MXN. We propose a Sparse
Bayesian Learning algorithm based on combining the Empirical Bayes and the
iterative coordinate descent procedures to estimate both the parameters and

methods are able to recover complicated source setups more accurately and with
a more robust variable selection than the ENET and LASSO solutions using
classical algorithms. We also solve the EEG IP using data coming from a visual

study the relation between the infrared luminosity (L_IR) and the dust
temperature (T) of dusty starbursting galaxies at high redshifts (high-z). We
focus on the total infrared luminosity from the cold-dust component
(L_IR^(cd)), whose emission can be described by a modified black body (MBB) of
a single temperature (T_mbb). An object on the (L_IR^(cd), T_mbb) plane can be
explained by the equivalent of the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a MBB with an
effective radius of R_eff. We show that R_eff is a good measure of the combined
size of the dusty starbursting regions (DSBRs) of the host galaxy. In at least
one case where the individual DSBRs are well resolved through strong
gravitational lensing, R_eff is consistent with the direct size measurement. We
show that the observed L_IR-T relation is simply due to the limited R_eff (<~ 2
kpc). The small R_eff values also agree with the compact sizes of the DSBRs
seen in the local universe. However, previous interferometric observations to
resolve high-z dusty starbursting galaxies often quote much larger sizes. This
inconsistency can be reconciled by the blending effect when considering that
the current interferometry might still not be of sufficient resolution. From
R_eff we infer the lower limits to the volume densities of the star formation
rate (""minSFR3D"") in the DSBRs, and find that the $L_{IR}$-$T$ relation
outlines a boundary on the (L_IR^(cd), T) plane, below which is the ""zone of
avoidance"" in terms of minSFR3D.

require two additional inputs: the time delay and the coupling strength. To
utilize the MSF for predicting the stability of AD of arbitrary networks for a

concept of master stability islands (MSIs), which are two-dimensional stability
islands of the delay-coupling space together with a third dimension

paper, the problem of energy-aware D2D LAN formation over cellular networks is
studied. The problem is formulated using a game-theoretic framework in which
each MU seeks to minimize its energy consumption while actively participating
in the D2D LAN. To account for the selfish behavior of the MUs, a punishment
and incentive protocol is proposed in order to ensure cooperation among MUs.
Within this protocol, an estimation algorithm is proposed to simulate the
process of D2D LAN formation and, then, adjust the mechanism parameters to
maintain cooperation. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can
improve energy efficiency up to 36% relative to the traditional multicast
scenario.

However, nowadays there is increasing evidence for dust formation in SNe. In
order to establish the relative importance of these two classes of stellar
sources of dust it is important to know what is the fraction of freshly formed
dust in SN ejecta that is able to survive the passage of the reverse shock and
be injected in the interstellar medium. With this aim, we have developed a new
code, GRASH_Rev, that allows to follow the dynamics of dust grains in the
shocked SN ejecta and to compute the time evolution of the mass, composition
and size distribution of the grains. We consider four well studied SNe in the
Milky Way and LMC: SN 1987a, Cas A, the Crab Nebula, and N49. For all the
simulated models, we find good agreement with observations. Our study suggests
that SN 1987A is too young for the reverse shock to have affected the dust
mass. Conversely, in the other three SNe, the reverse shock has already
destroyed between 10 and 40% of the initial dust mass. However, the largest
dust mass destruction is predicted to occur between 10^3 and 10^5 yr after the
explosions. Since the oldest SN in the sample has an estimated age of 4800 yr,
current observations can only provide an upper limit to the mass of SN dust
that will enrich the interstellar medium, the so-called effective dust yields.
We find that only between 1 and 8% of the currently observed mass will survive.
This is in good agreement with the values adopted in chemical evolution models
which consider the effect of the SN reverse shock. We discuss the astrophysical
implications of our results for dust enrichment in local galaxies and at high
redshift.

analysis, as measures of dependence among variables, and as descriptions of
order in biological and physical systems. Information related measures, like
marginal entropies, mutual / interaction / multi-information, have been used in
a number of fields including descriptions of systems complexity and biological
data analysis. The mathematical relationships among these measures are
therefore of significant interest. Relations between common information
measures include the duality relations based on M\""obius inversion on lattices.
These are the direct consequence of the symmetries of the lattices of the sets
of variables (subsets ordered by inclusion). While the mathematical properties
and relationships among these information-related measures are of significant
interest, there has been, to our knowledge, no systematic examination of the
full range of relationships and no unification of this diverse range of
functions into a single formalism as we do here. In this paper we define
operators on functions on these lattices based on the M\""obius inversion idea
that map the functions into one another (M\""obius operators.) We show that
these operators form a simple group isomorphic to the symmetric group S3.
Relations among the set of functions on the lattice are transparently expressed
in terms of the operator algebra, and, applied to the information measures, can
be used to derive a wide range of relationships among measures. We describe a
direct relation between sums of conditional log-likelihoods and previously
defined dependency measures. The algebra is naturally generalized which yields
more extensive relationships. This formalism provides a fundamental unification
of information related measures, but isomorphism of all distributive lattices

predict that at most $\sim 10$ subhalos might be present in the third Fermi LAT

prior studies, and we discuss the origin of this difference. We also compare
our predictions for the detectability of subhalos with the number of subhalo
candidate sources in 3FGL, and derive upper limits on the WIMP annihilation
cross-section as a function of the particle mass. If a dark matter

co-rotating gas in an extended disk cannot explain the observed kinematics of

with the scenario of gas accretion. An outflow from the central region of the
host-galaxy, on the other hand, would require a large opening angle (i.e.,
2$\theta>$150 degree), much larger than the observed outflow opening angles in
Seyfert galaxies, in order to intercept the QSO sightline. We thus favor a
scenario in which the H$_2$ bearing gas is stemming from a dwarf-satellite
galaxy, presumably via tidal and/or ram-pressure stripping. Detection of a
dwarf galaxy candidate in the HST/WFPC2 image at an impact parameter of

appear consistent with all known UFDs, the high r-process abundance of
Reticulum II suggests enrichment through a single, rare event, such as a double
neutron star (NS) merger. However, we note that this scenario is extremely
unlikely, as binary stellar evolution models require significant supernova
natal kicks to produce NS-NS or NS-black hole mergers, and these kicks would
efficiently remove compact binary systems from the weak gravitational
potentials of UFDs. We examine alternative mechanisms for the production of
r-process elements in UFDs, including a novel mechanism wherein NSs in regions
of high dark matter density implode after accumulating a black-hole-forming
mass of dark matter. We find that r-process proto-material ejection by tidal
forces, when a single neutron star implodes into a black hole, can occur at a
rate matching the r-process abundance of both Reticulum II and the Milky Way.
Remarkably, dark matter models which collapse a single neutron star in observed
UFDs also solve the missing pulsar problem in the Milky Way Galactic center. We
propose tests specific to dark matter r-process production which may uncover,

detect a wavelength dependence in the polarization which is low at the center
of the Ly$\alpha$ line profile and rises substantially in the wings of the

out-flowing shell model. The spectral dependence of the polarization presented
here provide a framework for future observations and interpretations of the
southern portion of LAB1 in that any model for this system must be able to
reproduce this particular spectral dependence. However, questions still remain

function is relatively flat for $M*<Msun. The contribution from older main
sequence stars and sub-giants is small but not negligible. From
Mbh~10^7.5-10^8.5Msun, the balance rapidly shifts to higher mass stars and a
larger contribution from evolved stars, and is ultimately dominated by evolved
stars at higher BH masses. The star formation history has little effect until
the rates are dominated by evolved stars. TDE rates should decline very rapidly
towards higher redshifts. The volumetric rate of TDEs is very high because the
BH mass function diverges for low masses. However, any emission mechanism which
is largely Eddington-limited for low BH masses suppresses this divergence in
any observed sample and leads to TDE samples dominated by Mbh~10^6.0-10^7.5Msun
BHs with roughly Eddington peak accretion rates. The typical fall back time is
relatively long, with 16% having Tfb<10^(-1) years (37 days), and 84% having
longer time scales. Many residual rate discrepancies can be explained if
surveys are biased against TDEs with these longer Tfb, which seems very
plausible if Tfb has any relation to the transient rise time. For almost any BH

close in both sky position and velocity have dispersions in these dimensions
that far exceed those seen within the stream. The stream's proximity to the
Galactic center suggests that the bar must have a significant influence on its
dynamical history: The triaxiality and time-dependence of the bar may generate
chaotic orbits in the vicinity of the stream that can greatly affect its
morphology. We explore this hypothesis with models of stream formation along
orbits consistent with Ophiuchus' properties in a Milky Way potential model
that includes a rotating bar. We find that in all choices for the rotation
parameters of the bar, orbits fit to the stream are strongly chaotic. Mock
streams generated along these orbits qualitatively match the observed
properties of the stream: because of chaos, stars stripped early generally form
low-density, high-dispersion ""fans"" leaving only the most recently disrupted
material detectable as a strong over-density. Our models predict that there
should be more low-surface-brightness tidal debris than detected so far, likely
with a complex phase-space morphology. The existence of or lack of these
features around the Ophiuchus stream would provide an interesting constraint on
the properties of the Milky Way bar and would help distinguish between
formation scenarios for the stream. This is the first time that chaos has been
used to explain the properties of a stellar stream and is the first
demonstration of the dynamical importance of chaos in the Galactic halo. The
existence of long, thin streams around the Milky Way---presumably formed along
non- or weakly-chaotic orbits---may represent only a subset of the total

We use ~100 deg^2 of KiDS data to study the lensing signal around galaxies for
which spectroscopic redshifts and stellar masses were determined by GAMA. We
show that lensing alone results in poor constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass
relation due to a degeneracy between the satellite fraction and the halo mass,
which is lifted when we simultaneously fit the stellar mass function. At
M_sun>5x10^10 h^-2 M_sun, the stellar mass increases with halo mass as
~M_h^0.25. The ratio of dark matter to stellar mass has a minimum at a halo
mass of 8x10^11 h^-1 M_sun with a value of M_h/M_*=56_-10^+16 [h]. We also use
the GAMA group catalogue to select centrals and satellites in groups with five
or more members, which trace regions in space where the local matter density is
higher than average, and determine for the first time the stellar-to-halo mass
relation in these denser environments. We find no significant differences
compared to the relation from the full sample, which suggests that the
stellar-to-halo mass relation does not vary strongly with local density.
Furthermore, we find that the stellar-to-halo mass relation of central galaxies
can also be obtained by modelling the lensing signal and stellar mass function
of satellite galaxies only, which shows that the assumptions to model the
satellite contribution in the halo model do not significantly bias the
stellar-to-halo mass relation. Finally, we show that the combination of weak

$\mathbf{C}$ is measured from a set of simulations, an important question is
how large this set should be. To answer this question, we construct different
ensembles of $N_r$ realizations of the shear field, using a common
randomization procedure that recycles the outputs from a smaller number
$N_s\leq N_r$ of independent ray-tracing $N$--body simulations. We study
parameter confidence intervals as a function of ($N_s,N_r$) in the range $1\leq
N_s\leq 200$ and $1\leq N_r\lesssim 10^5$. Previous work has shown that
Gaussian noise in the feature vectors (from which the covariance is estimated)
lead, at quadratic order, to an $O(1/N_r)$ degradation of the parameter
confidence intervals. Using a variety of lensing features measured in our
simulations, including shear-shear power spectra and peak counts, we show that
cubic and quartic covariance fluctuations lead to additional $O(1/N_r^2)$ error
degradation that is not negligible when $N_r$ is only a factor of few larger
than $N_b$. We study the large $N_r$ limit, and find that a single, 240Mpc$/h$

motivated misalignments in dark halo position, ellipticity, position angle and

error induced by assuming that light traces mass and find that this assumption

gas distribution. Interpreting the OVII K$\alpha$ absorption line strengths has
several complications, including optical depth and line of sight velocity
effects. Here, we present model absorption line profiles accounting for both of
these effects to show the lines can exhibit asymmetric structures and be
broader than the intrinsic Doppler width. The line profiles encode the hot gas
rotation curve, the net inflow or outflow of hot gas, and the hot gas angular
momentum profile. We show how line of sight velocity effects impact the
conversion between equivalent width and the column density, and provide
modified curves of growth accounting for these effects. As an example, we
analyze the LMC sight line pulsar dispersion measure and OVII equivalent width
to show the average gas metallicity is $\gtrsim 0.6 Z_{\odot}$ and $b$
$\gtrsim$ 100 km s$^{-1}$. Determining these properties offers valuable
insights into the dynamical state of the Milky Way's hot gas, and improves the

simulations of Sgr A*. We employ analytic models that capture the basic
characteristics of the images to understand the origin of the variability in
the simulated visibility amplitudes. We find that, in all simulations, the
visibility amplitudes for baselines oriented perpendicular to the spin axis of
the black hole typically decrease smoothly over baseline lengths that are
comparable to those of the EHT. On the other hand, the visibility amplitudes
for baselines oriented parallel to the spin axis show significant structure
with one or more minima. This suggests that fitting EHT observations with
geometric models will lead to reasonably accurate determination of the
orientation of the black-hole on the plane of the sky. However, in the
disk-dominated models, the locations and depths of the minima in the visibility
amplitudes depend primarily on the width and asymmetry of the crescent-like
images and are highly variable. In the jet-dominated models, the locations of
the minima are determined by the separation of the two image components but
their depths depend primarily on the relative brightness of the two components
and are also variable. This suggests that using time-independent models to
infer additional black-hole parameters, such as the shadow size or the spin
magnitude, will be severely affected by the variability of the accretion flow.

days. These observations represent the first solid detection of a young
extragalactic stripped-envelope SN out to high-energy X-rays. SN2014C was the
explosion of an H-stripped progenitor star with ordinary explosion parameters.
However, over the time scale of ~1yr, SN2014C experienced a complete
metamorphosis and evolved from an ordinary H-poor supernova of type Ib into a
strongly interacting, H-rich supernova of type IIn. Signatures of the SN shock
interacting with a dense medium are observed across the spectrum. Coordinated
observations with Swift, Chandra and NuSTAR have captured the evolution in
detail and revealed the presence of a massive shell of ~1 Msun of hydrogen-rich
material at ~6d16 cm from the explosion site. We estimate that the shell was
ejected by the progenitor star in the decades to centuries before core
collapse. This result poses significant challenges to current theories of
massive star evolution, as it requires a physical mechanism responsible for the
ejection of the deepest hydrogen layer of H-poor SN progenitors synchronized
with the onset of stellar collapse. Theoretical investigations point at binary
interactions and/or instabilities during the last stages of nuclear burning in
massive stars as potential triggers of the time-dependent mass loss. We
constrain these scenarios utilizing the sample of 183 SNe Ib/c with public
radio observations. Our analysis identifies SN2014C-like signatures in ~10% of
SNe with constraining radio data. This fraction is somewhat larger but
reasonably consistent with the expectation from the theory of recent envelope
ejection due to binary evolution IF the ejected material can survive in the
close environment for 1000-10000 yrs. Alternatively, nuclear burning
instabilities extending all the way to the core C-burning phase might also play
a critical role.

offers some advantages and is currently being considered as a target.In all
these cases the extra signature of the gamma rays following the de-excitation
of these states has definite advantages over the purely nuclear recoil and, in
principle, such a signature can be exploited experimentally. A brief discussion
of the experimental feasibility is given in the context of the CUORE

wireless cellular communication systems has motivated the study of large-scale
antenna arrays for achieving highly directional beamforming. However, the
conventional fully digital beamforming methods which require one radio
frequency (RF) chain per antenna element is not viable for large-scale antenna
arrays due to the high cost and high power consumption of RF chain components
in high frequencies. To address the challenge of this hardware limitation, this
paper considers a hybrid beamforming architecture in which the overall
beamformer consists of a low-dimensional digital beamformer followed by an RF
beamformer implemented using analog phase shifters. Our aim is to show that
such an architecture can approach the performance of a fully digital scheme
with much fewer number of RF chains. Specifically, this paper establishes that
if the number of RF chains is twice the total number of data streams, the
hybrid beamforming structure can realize any fully digital beamformer exactly,
regardless of the number of antenna elements. For cases with fewer number of RF
chains, this paper further considers the hybrid beamforming design problem for
both the transmission scenario of a point-to-point multipleinput
multiple-output (MIMO) system and a downlink multiuser multiple-input
single-output (MU-MISO) system. For each scenario, we propose a heuristic
hybrid beamforming design that achieves a performance close to the performance
of the fully digital beamforming baseline. Finally, the proposed algorithms are
modified for the more practical setting in which only finite resolution phase
shifters are available. Numerical simulations show that the proposed schemes
are effective even when phase shifters with very low resolution are used.

  Fourier Transform and Overlap-and-Add","British Machine Vision Conference 2015",,,,"cs.NE cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently state-of-the-art for
various classification tasks, but are computationally expensive. Propagating
through the convolutional layers is very slow, as each kernel in each layer
must sequentially calculate many dot products for a single forward and backward
propagation which equates to $\mathcal{O}(N^{2}n^{2})$ per kernel per layer
where the inputs are $N \times N$ arrays and the kernels are $n \times n$
arrays. Convolution can be efficiently performed as a Hadamard product in the
frequency domain. The bottleneck is the transformation which has a cost of
$\mathcal{O}(N^{2}\log_2 N)$ using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). However,
the increase in efficiency is less significant when $N\gg n$ as is the case in
CNNs. We mitigate this by using the ""overlap-and-add"" technique reducing the
computational complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2\log_2 n)$ per kernel. This method
increases the algorithm's efficiency in both the forward and backward
propagation, reducing the training and testing time for CNNs. Our empirical
results show our method reduces computational time by a factor of up to 16.3
times the traditional convolution implementation for a 8 $\times$ 8 kernel and
a 224 $\times$ 224 image.

the effects of this iron opacity ""bump"" on the thermal stability and vertical
structure of radiation pressure dominated accretion disks, utilizing three
dimensional radiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulations in the local shearing
box approximation. The simulations self-consistently calculate the heating due
to MHD turbulence caused by magneto-rotational instability and radiative
cooling by using the radiative transfer module based on a variable Eddington
tensor in Athena. For a $5\times 10^8$ solar mass black hole with $\sim 3\%$ of
the Eddington luminosity, a model including the iron opacity bump maintains its
structure for more than $10$ thermal times without showing significant signs of
thermal runaway. In contrast, if only electron scattering and free-free opacity
are included as in the standard thin disk model, the disk collapses on the
thermal time scale. The difference is caused by a combination of 1) an
anti-correlation between the total optical depth and the temperature, and 2)
enhanced vertical advective energy transport. These results suggest that the
iron opacity bump may have a strong impact on the stability and structure of
AGN accretion disks, and may contribute to a dependence of AGN properties on
metallicity. Since this opacity is relevant primarily in UV emitting regions of

this paper, we propose utility-driven caching, where we associate with each

metallic plates in the presence of an amplifying or an absorptive dielectric
slab has been studied by the path-integral quantization technique. The effect
of the amplifying slab, which is located between corrugated conductors, is to
increase the normal and lateral Casimir interactions, while the presence of the
absorptive slab diminishes the interactions. These effects are more pronounced
if the thickness of the slab increases, and also if the slab comes closer to
one of the bounding conductors. When both bounding ideal conductors are flat,
the normal Casimir force is non-monotonic in the presence of the amplifying
slab and the system has a stable mechanical equilibrium state, while the force
is attractive and is weakened by intervening the absorptive dielectric slab in
the cavity. By replacing one of the flat conductors by a flat ideal permeable
plate the force becomes non-monotonic and the system has an unstable mechanical
equilibrium state in the presence of either an amplifying or an absorptive

a convex body in a regression setting with random design. We are interested in
optimal rates of convergence under a squared global continuous $l_2$ loss in
the multivariate setting $(d\geq 2)$. One crucial fact is that the minimax
risks depend heavily on the shape of the support of the regression function. It
is shown that the global minimax risk is on the order of $n^{-2/(d+1)}$ when
the support is sufficiently smooth, but that the rate $n^{-4/(d+4)}$ is when
the support is a polytope. Such differences in rates are due to difficulties in
estimating the regression function near the boundary of smooth regions.
  We then study the natural bounded least squares estimators (BLSE): we show
that the BLSE nearly attains the optimal rates of convergence in low
dimensions, while suffering rate-inefficiency in high dimensions. We show that
the BLSE adapts nearly parametrically to polyhedral functions when the support
is polyhedral in low dimensions by a local entropy method. We also show that
the boundedness constraint cannot be dropped when risk is assessed via
continuous $l_2$ loss.
  Given rate sub-optimality of the BLSE in higher dimensions, we further study
rate-efficient adaptive estimation procedures. Two general model selection
methods are developed to provide sieved adaptive estimators (SAE) that achieve
nearly optimal rates of convergence for particular ""regular"" classes of convex
functions, while maintaining nearly parametric rate-adaptivity to polyhedral
functions in arbitrary dimensions. Interestingly, the uniform boundedness
constraint is unnecessary when risks are measured in discrete $l_2$ norms.

choice of the network parameters (e.g., transmission powers, transmission

high performance. In this work, we study the throughput optimization problem in
a system composed of an access point which recharges the batteries of two
devices at different distances. In the literature, the main focus so far has
been on slot-oriented optimization, in which all the harvested energy is used
in the same slot in which it is harvested. However, this approach is strongly
sub-optimal because it does not exploit the possibility to store the energy and
use it at a later time. Thus, instead of considering the slot-oriented case, we
address the long-term maximization. This assumption greatly increases the
optimization complexity, requiring to consider, e.g., the channel state
realizations, its statistics and the batteries evolution. Our objective is to
find the best scheduling scheme, both for the energy transferred by the access
point and for the data sent by the two nodes. We discuss how to perform the

differs from that of boundary singular metrics which have flat scalar curvature

extremal graphs and classical-quantum graphs. Applying this condition, we
exhibit a large class of so-called \emph{cheapest-full-rank graphs} whose

last few years. Thanks to MOOCs, millions of learners from all over the world
have taken thousands of high-quality courses for free. Putting together an
excellent MOOC ecosystem is a multidisciplinary endeavour that requires
contributions from many different fields. Artificial intelligence (AI) and data
mining (DM) are two such fields that have played a significant role in making
MOOCs what they are today. By exploiting the vast amount of data generated by
learners engaging in MOOCs, DM improves our understanding of the MOOC ecosystem
and enables MOOC practitioners to deliver better courses. Similarly, AI,
supported by DM, can greatly improve student experience and learning outcomes.
In this survey paper, we first review the state-of-the-art artificial
intelligence and data mining research applied to MOOCs, emphasising the use of
AI and DM tools and techniques to improve student engagement, learning
outcomes, and our understanding of the MOOC ecosystem. We then offer an
overview of key trends and important research to carry out in the fields of AI
and DM so that MOOCs can reach their full potential.

interferometric baseline of 14.4 meters, the LBTI nuller is specifically tuned
to resolve the habitable zone of nearby main-sequence stars, where warm
exozodiacal dust emission peaks. Measuring the exozodi luminosity function of
nearby main-sequence stars is a key milestone to prepare for future exoEarth

demonstrated in February 2015 a calibrated null accuracy of 0.05% over a

is equivalent to an exozodiacal disk density of 15 to 30 zodi for a Sun-like

post-change models. A change point is the time instant at which the
distribution of a random process changes. The objective of quickest change
detection is to minimize the detection delay of an unknown change point under
certain performance constraints, such as average run length (ARL) to false
alarm or probability of false alarm (PFA). Most existing change detection
procedures assume perfect knowledge of the random process distributions before
and after the change point. However, in many practical applications such as
anomaly detection, the post-change distribution is often unknown and needs to
be estimated with a limited number of samples. In this paper, we study the case
that there is a mismatch between the true post-change distribution and the one
used during detection. We analytically identify the impacts of mismatched
post-change models on two classical detection procedures, the cumulative sum
(CUSUM) procedure and the Shiryaev-Roberts (SR) procedure. The impacts of
mismatched models are characterized in terms of various finite or asymptotic
performance bounds on ARL, PFA, and average detection delay (ADD). It is shown
that post-change model mismatch results in an increase in ADD, and the rate of
performance degradation depends on the difference between two Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergences, one is between the priori- and post-change distributions, and
the other one is between the true and mismatched post-change distributions.

the most-likely confused, i.e. ""bottleneck"", Gaussian trees, as shown to be the

operation. In addition, such Chernoff information is shown to be determined
only by the maximum generalized eigenvalue of the two Gaussian covariance
matrices. The Chernoff information of scalar Gaussian variables as a result of
linear transformation (LT) of the original Gaussian vectors is also uniquely
determined by the same maximum generalized eigenvalue. What is even more
interesting is that after incorporating the cost of measurements into a
normalized Chernoff information, Gaussian variables from LT have larger

constrain the rate and latency of star formation in dense massive clumps that
are distributed throughout the Galaxy and to compare these results to proposed
prescriptions for stellar production. A sample of 24 micron-based Class~I
protostars are linked to dust clumps that are embedded within molecular clouds
selected from the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy. We determine
the fraction of star-forming clumps, f*, that imposes a constraint on the
latency of star formation in units of a clump's lifetime. Protostellar masses
are estimated from models of circumstellar environments of young stellar
objects from which star formation rates are derived. Physical properties of the
clumps are calculated from 870 micron dust continuum emission and NH_3 line
emission. Linear correlations are identified between the star formation rate
surface density, Sigma_{SFR}, and the quantities Sigma_{H2}/tau_{ff} and
Sigma_{H2}/tau_{cross}, suggesting that star formation is regulated at the
local scales of molecular clouds. The measured fraction of star forming clumps
is 23%. Accounting for star formation within clumps that are excluded from our
sample due to 24 micron saturation, this fraction can be as high as 31%. Dense,
massive clumps form primarily low mass (< 1-2 msun) stars with emergent 24

effects of the molecular geometry on the system's properties are studied

  In this work, we introduce a novel notion of separation of source and network
coding using G\'acs-K\""orner Common Information (CI). Unlike existing notions
of separation, the sufficient condition for this separation to hold depends on
the source structure rather than the network topology. Using the suggested
separation scheme, we tackle three important multi-source problems. The first
is the multi-source multicast. We construct efficient, zero error source codes,
and via properties of the CI completely characterize the resulting rate region.
The second is broadcast with side information. We establish a duality between
this problem and the classical problem of degraded message set broadcast, and
give two code constructions and their associated regions. Finally, we consider
the Ahlswede-Korner problem in a network, and give an efficient solution which
is tight under the CI constraints.

Using particle in cell simulations with real mass ratio, the practicality of
large magnetic compression on timescales shorter than the ion gyro-period is
investigated. For compression times shorter than the transit time of a
compressional Alfven wave across the plasma slab, results show the formation of
two counter-propagating shock waves, leading to a highly non-uniform plasma
density profile. Furthermore, the plasma slab displays large hydromagnetic like
oscillations after the driving field has reached steady state. Peak compression
is obtained when the two shocks collide in the mid-plane. At this instant, very
large plasma heating is observed, and plasma $\beta$ is estimated to be about
$1$. Although these results point out a densification mechanism quite different
and more complex than initially envisioned, these features could possibly be

to define the position on the ""luminosity versus effective temperature"" diagram
and to assign an appropriate theoretical evolutionary track to each star.
Making use of this advantage, we examined whether the stellar location on this
diagram really matches the assigned track, which would make an interesting
consistency check between theory and observation. It turned out that
satisfactory agreement was confirmed in most cases (~90%, though appreciable
discrepancies were seen for some stars such as higher-mass red-clump giants),
suggesting that recent stellar evolution calculations are practically reliable.
Since the relevant stellar age could also be obtained by this comparison, we
derived the age-metallicity relation for these Kepler giants and found the
following characteristics: (1) The resulting distribution is quite similar to
what was previously concluded for FGK dwarfs. (2) The dispersion of metallicity
progressively increases as the age becomes older. (3) Nevertheless, the maximum
metallicity at any stellar age remains almost flat, which means the existence
of super/near-solar metallicity stars in a considerably wide age range from

hydrophobic effects. When a hydrophobic solute is dissolved into water, an
interface appears between the solute and water. To understand the mechanism of
hydrophobic effects, it is necessary to study the structure of water and

investigate the physical origin of hydrophobic effects. According to the
discussion on hydration free energy, with increasing solute size, it can be
divided into the initial and hydrophobic solvation processes, respectively. In
the initial solvation process, hydration free energy is dominated by the
hydrogen bonding in interfacial water (topmost water layer at the solute/water
interface). However, in the hydrophobic solvation process, the hydration free
energy is related to hydrogen bondings of both bulk water and interfacial
water. Additionally, various dissolved behaviors of solutes can be expected for
different solvation processes. From this, hydrophobic effects can be ascribed
to the competition between the hydrogen bondings in bulk water and those in
interfacial water.

matrix optimization problems via gauge dual, one is usually able to avoid full
matrix decompositions such as singular value and/or eigenvalue decompositions.
In such an approach, a gauge dual problem is solved in the first stage, and
then an optimal solution to the primal problem can be recovered from the dual
optimal solution obtained in the first stage. Recently, this theory has been
applied to a class of \emph{semidefinite programming} (SDP) problems with
promising numerical results [Friedlander and Mac{\^e}do, SIAM J. Sci. Comp., to

characterize the optimality conditions for the primal-dual gauge pair, and
validate a way to recover a primal optimal solution from a dual one. These
results are extensions of [Friedlander and Mac{\^e}do, SIAM J. Sci. Comp., to

with uplink-downlink decoupling is studied for an SCN that incorporates LTE in
the unlicensed band (LTE-U). Here, the users can access both licensed and

problem is formulated as a noncooperative game that incorporates user
association, spectrum allocation, and load balancing. To solve this problem, a
distributed algorithm based on the machine learning framework of echo state

of heavy elements (atomic number Z > 20) than their 1D counterparts due to
dredge-up by fluid instabilities. Since almost no Ni is ejected by these weak

noiseless finite-field measurements using the linearity of lattice codewords.
In the second stage, syndrome decoding is applied over the finite-field to
reconstruct the sparse signal vector. A sufficient condition of a perfect
recovery is derived. Our theoretical result demonstrates an interplay among the
quantization level $p$, the sparsity level $k$, the signal dimension $n$, and
the number of measurements $m$ for the perfect recovery. Considering 1-bit

  probability in $^{20}$Ne",,,,,"nucl-th nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  $^{20}$Ne has been known as a typical example of a nucleus with $\alpha$
cluster structure ($^{16}$O+$\alpha$ structure). However according to the
spherical shell model, the spin-orbit interaction acts attractively for four
nucleons outside of the $^{16}$O core, and this spin-orbit effect cannot be
taken into account in the simple $\alpha$ cluster models. We investigate how
the $\alpha$ cluster structure competes with independent particle motions of
these four nucleons. The antisymmetrized quasi-cluster model (AQCM) is a method
to describe a transition from the $\alpha$ cluster wave function to the
$jj$-coupling shell model wave function. In this model, the cluster-shell
transition is characterized by only two parameters; $R$ representing the
distance between clusters and $\Lambda$ describing the breaking of $\alpha$
clusters, and the contribution of the spin-orbit interaction, very important in
the $jj$-coupling shell model, can be taken into account by changing $\alpha$
clusters to quasi clusters. In this article, based on AQCM, we apply $^{16}$O
plus one quasi cluster model for $^{20}$Ne. Here we focus on the $E0$
transition matrix element, which has been known as the quantity characterizing
the cluster structure. The $E0$ transition matrix elements are sensitive to the
change of the wave functions from $\alpha$ cluster to $jj$-coupling shell
model.

HPCA 2013. The key goal of TL-DRAM is to provide low DRAM latency at low cost,
a critical problem in modern memory systems. To this end, TL-DRAM introduces
heterogeneity into the design of a DRAM subarray by segmenting the bitlines,
thereby creating a low-latency, low-energy, low-capacity portion in the
subarray (called the near segment), which is close to the sense amplifiers, and
a high-latency, high-energy, high-capacity portion, which is farther away from
the sense amplifiers. Thus, DRAM becomes heterogeneous with a small portion
having lower latency and a large portion having higher latency. Various
techniques can be employed to take advantage of the low-latency near segment
and this new heterogeneous DRAM substrate, including hardware-based caching and
software based caching and memory allocation of frequently used data in the
near segment. Evaluations with simple such techniques show significant
performance and energy-efficiency benefits.

  with vascular mild cognitive impairment using latent tree analysis",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: To treat patients with vascular mild cognitive impairment (VMCI)
using TCM, it is necessary to classify the patients into TCM syndrome types and
to apply different treatments to different types. We investigate how to
properly carry out the classification using a novel data-driven method known as
latent tree analysis.
  Method: A cross-sectional survey on VMCI was carried out in several regions
in northern China from 2008 to 2011, which resulted in a data set that involves
803 patients and 93 symptoms. Latent tree analysis was performed on the data to
reveal symptom co-occurrence patterns, and the patients were partitioned into
clusters in multiple ways based on the patterns. The patient clusters were
matched up with syndrome types, and population statistics of the clusters are
used to quantify the syndrome types and to establish classification rules.
  Results: Eight syndrome types are identified: Qi Deficiency, Qi Stagnation,
Blood Deficiency, Blood Stasis, Phlegm-Dampness, Fire-Heat, Yang Deficiency,
and Yin Deficiency. The prevalence and symptom occurrence characteristics of
each syndrome type are determined. Quantitative classification rules are
established for determining whether a patient belongs to each of the syndrome
types.
  Conclusions: A solution for the TCM syndrome classification problem
associated with VMCI is established based on the latent tree analysis of
unlabeled symptom survey data. The results can be used as a reference in clinic
practice to improve the quality of syndrome differentiation and to reduce
diagnosis variances across physicians. They can also be used for patient
selection in research projects aimed at finding biomarkers for the syndrome
types and in randomized control trials aimed at determining the efficacy of TCM
treatments of VMCI.

polycrystalline form and thus contains grain boundaries. In the present work,
the effect of uniaxial strain on the electronic transport properties through
graphene grain boundaries is investigated using atomistic simulations. A
systematic picture of the transport properties with respect to the strain and
the lattice symmetry of graphene domains on both sides of the boundary is
provided. In particular, it is shown that the strain engineering can be used to
open a finite transport gap in all graphene systems where two domains exhibit
different orientations. This gap value is found to depend on the strain
magnitude, on the strain direction and on the lattice symmetry of graphene
domains. By choosing appropriately the strain direction, a large transport gap
of a few hundred meV can be achieved when applying a small strain of only a few
percents. For a specific class of graphene grain boundary systems, the strain
engineering can also be used to reduce the scattering on defects and hence to
significantly enhance the conductance. With a large strain-induced gap, these
graphene heterostructures are proposed to be possible candidates for highly
sensitive strain sensors, flexible transistors and p-n junctions with a strong
non-linear I-V characteristics.

in an improved signal-to-background ratio at lower laser excitation powers.

in cosmology, makes the question of the origin of mass-energy content of the
universe more urgent than ever. There are two philosophies regarding this
question: according to Mach's principle it is matter that generates geometry of
space-time, and according to Wheeler's geometrodynamics some configurations of
space-time geometry are to be interpreted as its material content. Neither of
these philosophies has led to success. In the present paper, we show that there
exists an algebraic generalisation of geometry that reconciles, in a sense,
these two seemingly opposite standpoints. The geometry is constructed with the
help of a noncommutative algebra of smooth functions on a groupoid and its
derivations. The groupoid in question has a nice physical interpretation: it
can be regarded as a space of Lorentz rotations. In this way, Lorentz
symmetries are inherent to the generalised geometry of space-time. We define
the action for this geometry and, by varying it, obtain generalised vacuum
Einstein equations (for a simplified model). It turns out that these equations
contain additional terms (with respect to the standard vacuum Einstein
equations) which are naturally interpreted as the components of the
energy-momentum tensor. Matter is thus created out of purely geometric degrees
of freedom. We find two exact solutions (for even more simplified case). We
argue that the creation of matter, being a global effect, makes the contrast
between Mach and Wheeler philosophies ineffective.

armchair-edge terminated graphene nanoribbons separated by a thin insulating
barrier. In contrast to graphene monolayers, the multiple subbands of the
nanoribbons are parabolic at low energy with a gap between the conduction and
valence bands, and with lifted valley degeneracy. These properties make
screening of the electron-hole interaction much weaker than for coupled
electron-hole monolayers, thus boosting the pairing strength and enhancing the
superfluid properties. The pairing strength is further boosted by the
quasi-one-dimensional quantum confinement of the carriers, as well as by the
large density of states near the bottom of each subband. The latter magnifies
the superfluid shape resonances caused by the quantum confinement. Several
superfluid partial condensates are present for finite-width nanoribbons with
multiple subbands. We find that superfluidity is predominately in the
strongly-coupled BEC and BCS-BEC crossover regimes, with large superfluid gaps
up to 100 meV and beyond. When the gaps exceed the subband spacing, there is
significant mixing of the subbands, a rounding of the shape resonances, and a

engineering in many ways. They are often used in formal verification and also
can serve as visual software models. The latter application is associated with
the problems of software synthesis and automatic derivation of software models
from specification. Smaller synthesized models are more general and are easier
to comprehend, yet the problem of minimum FSM identification has received
little attention in previous research.
  This paper presents four exact methods to tackle the problem of minimum FSM
identification from a set of test scenarios and a temporal specification
represented in linear temporal logic. The methods are implemented as an
open-source tool. Three of them are based on translations of the FSM
identification problem to SAT or QSAT problem instances. Accounting for
temporal properties is done via counterexample prohibition. Counterexamples are
either obtained from previously identified FSMs, or based on bounded model
checking. The fourth method uses backtracking. The proposed methods are
evaluated on several case studies and on a larger number of randomly generated
instances of increasing complexity. The results show that the Iterative
SAT-based method is the leader among the proposed methods. The methods are also
compared with existing inexact approaches, i.e. the ones which do not
necessarily identify the minimum FSM, and these comparisons show encouraging
results.

collective spiral motions, which leads to elliptically polarized
synchrotron-like radiation with flexible tunability on radiation intensity,
spectra and polarization. We demonstrate that a radiation source with
millimeter size and peak brilliance of $2\times10^{19}
photons/s/mm^{2}/mrad^{2}/0.1%$ bandwidth can be made with moderate laser and

N2H+ are detected and are shown to trace the motions of the outflow. For CO,
also the circumstellar envelope and the surrounding cloud have a profound

suppressed towards the central region, perhaps due to the competing reaction
between CO and H3+ in the densest regions as well as destruction of N2H+ by CO.
N2D+ is detected in a ridge south-west from the protostellar condensation. The
morphology and kinematics of the CO emission suggests that the source is
younger than 1000 years. The mass, momentum, momentum rate, mechanical
luminosity, kinetic energy and mass-loss rate are also all estimated to be low.

heater thus forming a germ for the vapor film. The vapor recoil force not only
causes the vapor spreading, it also creates a strong adhesion to the heater
that prevents the bubble departure, thus favoring the further bubble spreading.
Near the liquid-gas critical point, the bubble growth is very slow and allows
the kinetics of the bubble spreading to be observed. Since the surface tension
is very small in this regime, only microgravity conditions can preserve a
convex bubble shape. Under such conditions, we observed an increase of the
apparent contact angle and spreading of the dry spot under the bubble, thus

coalescence of two water drops on a plane solid surface. The case of partial
wetting is considered. The drops are in an atmosphere of nitrogen saturated
with water where they grow by condensation and eventually touch each other and
coalesce. A new convex composite drop is rapidly formed that then exponentially
and slowly relaxes to an equilibrium hemispherical cap. The characteristic
relaxation time is proportional to the drop radius R * at final equilibrium.
This relaxation time appears to be nearly 10 7 times larger than the bulk
capillary relaxation time t b = R * $\eta$/$\sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the
gas--liquid surface tension and $\eta$ is the liquid shear viscosity. In order
to explain this extremely large relaxation time, we consider a model that
involves an Arrhenius kinetic factor resulting from a liquid--vapour phase
change in the vicinity of the contact line. The model results in a large
relaxation time of order t b exp(L/RT) where L is the molar latent heat of
vaporization, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature. We model the late
time relaxation for a near spherical cap and find an exponential relaxation
whose typical time scale agrees reasonably well with the experiment. 1.
Introduction Fusion or coalescence between drops is a key process in a wide
range of phenomena: phase transition in fluids and liquid mixtures or polymers,
stability of foams and emulsions, and sintering in metallurgy (Eggers 1998),
which is why the problem of coalescence has already received considerable
attention. Most of the studies of this process so far have been devoted to the
coalescence of two spherical drops floating in a medium. The kinetics of the
process before and after the drops have touched each other is governed by the
hydrodynamics inside and outside the drops and by the van der Waals forces when
the drops are within mesoscopic distance from each other (Yiantsios \& Davis
1991). The composite drop that results from the coalescence of two drops
relaxes to a spherical shape within a time which is dominated by the relaxation
of the flow inside and outside (Nikolayev, Beysens \& Guenoun 1996; Nikolayev
\& Beysens 1997). There are no studies, to our knowledge, of the coalescence of
two sessile drops after they touch each other. In this paper, we report a
preliminary study of the dynamics and morphology of this process, in the case
of hemispherical water droplets which grow slowly on a plane surface at the
expense of the surrounding atmosphere, forming what is called 'dew' or 'breath
figures' (Beysens et al. 1991; Beysens 1995). The drops eventually touch each
other and coalesce to form an elongated composite

automatic control and smart systems engineering on both theoretical and
practical levels. Designing CPS requires approaches involving multidisciplinary
competences. However they are designed to be autonomous, the CPS present a part
of uncertainty, which requires interaction with human for engineering,
monitoring, controlling, performing operational maintenance, etc. This
human-CPS interaction led naturally to the human in-the-loop (HITL) concept.
Nevertheless, this HITL concept , which stems from a reductionist point of
view, exhibits limitations due to the different natures of the systems
involved. As opposed to this classical approach, we propose, in this paper, a
model of Bio-CPS (i.e. systems based on an integration of computational
elements within biological systems) grounded on theoretical biology, physics
and computer sciences and based on the key concept of human systems
integration.

obtained for the case when the energy density difference between the two vacua
is small, the so called thin wall regime, but is considered of more general
validity. Here we show that when this condition does not hold, however, {\it a
strong gravitational field (Planckian physics) does not necessarily induce a
total suppression of true vacuum bubble nucleation}. Contrary to common
expectations then, gravitational physics at the Planck scale {\it does not
stabilize the false vacuum}. These results are of crucial importance for the
stability analysis of the electroweak vacuum and for searches of new physics

problem which is crucial for many microfluidics applications. We focus on the
regime at low capillary number and three-dimensional direct numerical
simulations are performed to investigate the problem. In order to reduce the
computational cost, an adaptive mesh is employed and high mesh resolution is
only used near the interface. Parametric studies are performed on the droplet
horizontal radius and the capillary number. For droplets with an horizontal
radius larger than half the channel height the droplet overfills the channel
and exhibits a pancake shape. A lubrication film is formed between the droplet
and the wall and particular attention is paid to the effect of the lubrication
film on the droplet velocity. The computed velocity of the pancake droplet is
shown to be lower than the average inflow velocity, which is in agreement with
experimental measurements. The numerical results show that both the strong
shear induced by the lubrication film and the three-dimensional flow structure
contribute to the low mobility of the droplet. In this low-migration-velocity
scenario the interfacial flow in the droplet reference frame moves toward the
rear on the top and reverses direction moving to the front from the two side
edges. The velocity of the pancake droplet and the thickness of the lubrication
film are observed to decrease with capillary number. The droplet velocity and
its dependence on capillary number cannot be captured by the classic Hele--Shaw
equations, since the depth-averaged approximation neglects the effect of the
lubrication film.

uses radio frequency (RF) mirrors at the transmit antenna(s) in order to create

fade realizations constitute the modulation alphabet. MBM has the advantage of
increased spectral efficiency and performance. In this paper, we investigate
the performance of some physical layer techniques when applied to MBM.
Particularly, we study the performance of $i)$ MBM with generalized spatial

improved bit error performance, and that phase compensation and MBM
constellation rotation increases the ED between the MBM constellation points
and improves the performance significantly. We also analyze the diversity
orders achieved by the ED-based MAP selection scheme and the phase compensation

observed interesting collective dynamical phases namely: asynchronous, where

quantum state, known as Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Compared to
Wannier-Mott excitons in inorganic semiconductors, the localized Frenkel
excitons in organic emitter materials show weaker interaction but stronger
coupling, which recently enabled the first realization of BEC at room
temperature. However, this required ultrafast optical pumping which limits the
applications of organic BECs. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature BEC of
cavity-polaritons in simple laminated microcavities filled with the
biologically produced enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). The unique
molecular structure of eGFP prevents exciton annihilation even at high
excitation densities, thus facilitating BEC under conventional nanosecond
pumping. BEC is clearly evidenced by a distinct threshold, an
interaction-induced blueshift of the condensate, long-range coherence and the
presence of a second threshold at higher excitation density which is associated
with the onset of photon lasing and results from thermalization of the exciton
reservoir.

The fact that eclipsing binaries belong to a stellar group is
useful, because the former can be used to estimate distance and additional
properties of the latter, and vice versa. Aims. Our goal is to analyse new
spectroscopic observations of BD$+36^\circ3317$ along with the photometric
observations from the literature and, for the first time, to derive all basic
physical properties of this binary. We aim to find out whether the binary is
indeed a member of the $\delta$ Lyr open cluster. Methods. The spectra were
reduced using the IRAF program and the radial velocities were measured with the
program SPEFO. The line spectra of both components were disentangled with the
program KOREL and compared to a grid of synthetic spectra. The final combined
radial-velocity and photometric solution was obtained with the program PHOEBE.
Results. We obtained the following physical elements of BD$+36^\circ3317$: $M_1
= 2.24\pm0.07 M_{\odot}$, $M_2 = 1.52\pm0.03 M_{\odot}$, $R_1 = 1.76\pm0.01
R_{\odot}$, $R_2 = 1.46\pm0.01 R_{\odot}$, $log L_1 = 1.52\pm0.08 L_{\odot}$,
$log L_2 = 0.81\pm0.07 L_{\odot}$. We derived the effective temperatures
$T_{eff,1} = 10450 \pm 420$ K, $T_{eff,2} = 7623 \pm 328$ K. Both components
are located close to ZAMS in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and their
masses and radii are consistent with the predictions of stellar evolutionary
models. Our results imply the average distance to the system d = $330\pm29$ pc.
We re-investigated the membership of BD$+36^\circ3317$ in the $\delta$ Lyr
cluster and confirmed it. The distance to BD$+36^\circ3317$, given above,
therefore represents an accurate estimate of the true distance for $\delta$ Lyr
cluster. Conclusions. The reality of the $\delta$ Lyr cluster and the cluster
membership of BD$+36^\circ3317$ have been reinforced.

predicted further ratios of exclusive reactions that can be measured and tested

solve an outstanding problem. Finally, we computed the so called strangeness

lucky prognoses of CC is equal to that of the eclipsing binary Algol during
this historical era. We wanted to find out the vocabulary that represents Algol
in the mythological texts of CC. Here we show that Algol was represented as
Horus and thus signified both divinity and kingship. The texts describing the
actions of Horus are consistent with the course of events witnessed by any
naked eye observer of Algol. These descriptions support our claim that CC is
the oldest preserved historical document of the discovery of a variable star.
The period of the Moon, 29.6 days, has also been discovered in CC. We show that
the actions of Seth were connected to this period, which also strongly
regulated the times described as lucky for Heaven and for Earth. Now, for the
first time, periodicity is discovered in the descriptions of the days in CC.

\in \mathbb{S}_n$ is proportional to $q^{\textrm{inv}(\pi)}$ where $0<q\le 1$
and $\textrm{inv}(\pi)$ is the number of inversions in $\pi$.
  We show that the expected length of the cycle containing a given point is of
order $\min\{(1-q)^{-2}, n\}$. This marks the existence of two asymptotic
regimes: with high probability, when $n$ tends to infinity with $(1-q)^{-2} \ll
n$ then all cycles have size $o(n)$ whereas when $n$ tends to infinity with
$(1-q)^{-2}\gg n$ then macroscopic cycles, of size proportional to $n$, emerge.
In the second regime, we prove that the distribution of normalized cycle
lengths follows the Poisson-Dirichlet law, as in a uniformly random
permutation. The results bear formal similarity with a conjectured localization
transition for random band matrices.
  Further results are presented for the variance of the cycle lengths, the
expected diameter of cycles and the expected number of cycles. The proofs rely
on the exact sampling algorithm for the Mallows distribution and make use of a
special diagonal exposure process for the graph of the permutation.

Gross-Zagier formula to the case of Shimura curves over totally real fields.
Let $F$ be a totally real field. Let $f$ be a Hilbert modular form over $F$ of
parallel weight $2$, which is a new form and is ordinary at $p$. Let $E$ be a
totally imaginary quadratic extension of $F$ of discriminant prime to $p$ and
to the conductor of $f$. We may construct a $p$-adic $L$ function that
interpolates special values of the complex $L$ functions associated to $f$, $E$
and finite order Hecke characters of $E$. The $p$-adic Gross-Zagier formula
relates the central derivative of this $p$-adic $L$ function to the $p$-adic
height of a Heegner divisor on a certain Shimura curve.
  The strategy of the proof is close to that of the original work of
Perrin-Riou. In the analytic part, we construct the analytic kernel via adelic
computations; in the geometric part, we decompose the geometric kernel into two
parts: places outside $p$ and places dividing $p$. For places outside $p$, the
$p$-adic heights are essentially intersection numbers and are computed in works
of S. Zhang, and it turns out that this part is closely related to the analytic
kernel. For places dividing $p$, we use the method in the work of J.

$\gamma \gamma \to \gamma \gamma$ subprocess are calculated including two
different mechanisms. We take into account box diagrams with leptons and quarks
in the loops. In addition, we consider a vector-meson dominance (VDM-Regge)
contribution with virtual intermediate hadronic (vector-like) excitations of
the photons. We get much higher cross sections in $PbPb$ collisions than in
earlier calculation from the literature. This opens a possibility to study the
$\gamma \gamma \to \gamma \gamma$ (quasi)elastic scattering at the LHC. We
present many interesting differential distributions which could be measured by
the ALICE, CMS or ATLAS Collaborations at the LHC. We study whether a
separation or identification of different components (boxes, VDM-Regge) is
possible. We find that the cross section for elastic $\gamma \gamma$ scattering
could be measured in the heavy-ion collisions for subprocess energies smaller
than $W_{\gamma\gamma} \approx 15-20$ GeV.

data-structure resulting from the forwarding tables of a network. A classical
concern is the detection of loops. We study this problem in the context of
software-defined networking (SDN) where forwarding rules can be arbitrary
bitmasks (generalizing prefix matching) and where tables are updated by a
centralized controller. Basic verification problems such as loop detection are
NP-hard and most previous work solves them with heuristics or SAT solvers. We
follow a different approach based on computing a representation of the header
classes, i.e. the sets of headers that match the same rules. This
representation consists in a collection of representative header sets, at least
one for each class, and can be computed centrally in time which is polynomial
in the number of classes. Classical verification tasks can then be trivially
solved by checking each representative header set. In general, the number of
header classes can increase exponentially with header length, but it remains
polynomial in the number of rules in the practical case where rules are
constituted with predefined fields where exact, prefix matching or range
matching is applied in each field (e.g., IP/MAC addresses, TCP/UDP ports). We
propose general techniques that work in polynomial time as long as the number
of classes of headers is polynomial and that do not make specific assumptions
about the structure of the sets associated to rules. The efficiency of our
method rely on the fact that the data-structure representing rules allows
efficient computation of intersection, cardinal and inclusion. Finally, we
propose an algorithm to maintain such representation in presence of updates
(i.e., rule insert/update/removal). We also provide a local distributed
algorithm for checking the absence of black-holes and a proof labeling scheme
for locally checking the absence of loops.

systems continues to be at the forefront of condensed matter physics.
Heavy-fermion materials, whose electronic structure is essentially
three-dimensional, are one of the most suitable systems for obtaining novel
electronic states because they demonstrate many fascinating properties.
Recently, a state-of-the-art MBE technique has been developed to reduce the
dimensionality of the heavy electrons by fabricating heavy fermion
superlattices, which can produce new electronic states present in
two-dimensional (2D) heavy fermion system. In superlattices of
antiferromagnetic heavy fermion CeIn3 and conventional metal LaIn3, the
magnetic order is suppressed by reducing the thickness of the CeIn3 layers. The
2D confinement of heavy fermion also leads to the enhancement of the effective
mass and the deviation from the Fermi liquid properties, which are associated
with the dimensional tuning of quantum criticality. In superconducting
superlattices of heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn5 and nonmagnetic metal
YbCoIn5, superconductivity is realized even at one-unit-cell-thick layer of
CeCoIn5. The thickness reduction of the CeCoIn5 layers drastically changes the
temperature and angular dependencies of the upper critical field. This result
would be attributed to a suppression of the Pauli pair-breaking effect through
the local inversion symmetry breaking (ISB) at the interfaces of CeCoIn5 block
layers. The importance of the ISB in this system has also been supported by
site-selective nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In addition, recent
experiment of CeCoIn5/YbCoIn5 superlattices have shown that the degree of the
ISB are controllable, which offers the prospect of achieving even more
fascinating superconducting states. These Kondo superlattices, thus, pave the
way for exploring unusual metallic and superconducting states.

dispersed agents learn continually from streaming data by means of local
interactions. The simultaneous requirements of adaptation and cooperation are
achieved by employing diffusion algorithms with constant step-size {\mu}. In
[1], [2] some main features of adaptive distributed detection were revealed. By
resorting to large deviations analysis, it was established that the Type-I and
Type-II error probabilities of all agents vanish exponentially as functions of
1/{\mu}, and that all agents share the same Type-I and Type-II error exponents.
However, numerical evidences presented in [1], [2] showed that the theory of
large deviations does not capture the fundamental impact of network
connectivity on performance, and that additional tools and efforts are required
to obtain accurate predictions for the error probabilities. This work addresses
these open issues and extends the results of [1], [2] in several directions. By
conducting a refined asymptotic analysis based on the mathematical framework of
exact asymptotics, we arrive at a revealing and powerful understanding of the
universal behavior of distributed detection over adaptive networks: as
functions of 1/{\mu}, the error (log-)probability curves corresponding to
different agents stay nearly-parallel to each other (as already discovered in
[1], [2]), however, these curves are ordered following a criterion reflecting
the degree of connectivity of each agent. Depending on the combination weights,
the more connected an agent is, the lower its error probability curve will be.
Interesting and somehow unexpected behaviors emerge, in terms of the interplay
between the network topology, the combination weights, and the inference
performance. The lesson learned is that connectivity matters.

are made electronically available. We exploit those data to study the effect of
mass, C/O ratio and nitrogen abundance on the photometry of K and M giants.
Depending on effective temperature, surface gravity and the chosen wavelength
ranges variations of the investigated parameters cause very weak to moderate
and, in the case of C/O values close to one, even strong shifts of the colours.
For the usage with stellar evolution calculations they will be treated as
correction factors applied to the results of an interpolation in the main

to data from the Galactic Bulge, we find in general a good agreement.
Deviations appear for the coolest giants showing pulsations, mass loss and dust

synchrotron radiation, for condensed pure and mixed methanol ice in the 7 -- 14
eV range. The VUV photodesorption of intact methanol molecules from pure
methanol ices is found to be of the order of 10$^{-5}$ molecules/photon, that
is two orders of magnitude below what is generally used in astrochemical
models. This rate gets even lower ($<$ 10$^{-6}$ molecules/photon) when the
methanol is mixed with CO molecules in the ices. This is consistent with a
picture in which photodissociation and recombination processes are at the
origin of intact methanol desorption from pure CH$_3$OH ices. Such low rates
are explained by the fact that the overall photodesorption process is dominated
by the desorption of the photofragments CO, CH$_3$, OH, H$_2$CO and
CH$_3$O/CH$_2$OH, whose photodesorption rates are given in this study. Our
results suggest that the role of the photodesorption as a mechanism to explain
the observed gas phase abundances of methanol in cold media is probably
overestimated. Nevertheless, the photodesorption of radicals from methanol-rich
ices may stand at the origin of the gas phase presence of radicals such as
CH$_3$O, therefore opening new gas phase chemical routes for the formation of
complex molecules.

excessive cloud resources and a decision support system, large generated data

largely depends on the usage of computation, storage and bandwidth resources,
hence cutting the cost of cloud based data storage becomes a big concern for

novel strategy that can cost effectively store large generated data sets with
multiple cloud service providers. The strategy is based on a novel algorithm
that finds the trade off among computation, storage and bandwidth costs in the
cloud, which are three key factors for the cost of data storage. Both general

models and three specific case studies on real world scientific applications

case the optimal work extraction is larger: when the reservoir is an infinite
source at $T_+$ and the system is a sink at $T_-$, or, when the reservoir is an
infinite sink at $T_-$ and the system acts as a source at $T_+$? It is found
that in order to compare the total extracted work, and the corresponding

an inequality, the so-called arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality,
involving the arithmetic and the geometric means of the two temperature values

certain universal bounds, given only in terms of the ratio of initial
temperatures. The general theoretical results are exemplified for thermodynamic
systems for which internal energy and temperature are power laws of the
entropy. The conclusions may serve as benchmarks in the design of heat engines,
where we can choose the nature of the finite system, so as to tune the total
extractable work and/or the corresponding efficiency.

transport mechanism for Optical Packet/Burst Switched (OPS/OBS) networks. The
CPT scheme exploits the combined benefits of source coding by erasure codes and
path diversity to provide efficient means for recovering from packet loss due
to contentions and path failures, and to provide non-cryptographic secrecy. In
the CPT scheme, erasure coding is employed at the OPS/OBS ingress node to form
coded packets, which are transmitted on disjoint paths from the ingress node to
an egress node in the network. The CPT scheme allows for a unified view of
Quality of Service (QoS) in OPS/OBS networks by linking the interactions
between survivability, performance and secrecy. We provide analytical models
that illustrate how QoS aspects of CPT are affected by the number of disjoint

tasks. Each job has a non-increasing time-value curve associated with it. Jobs
are submitted to and scheduled by a market-clearing centralised auctioneer.
This paper compares the performance of several policies for generating task
bids. The aim investigated here is to maximise the value for the platform
provider while minimising the number of jobs that do not complete (or starve).
It is found that the Projected Value Remaining bidding policy gives the highest
level of value under a typical overload situation, and gives the lowest number
of starved tasks across the space of utilisation examined. It does this by
attempting to capture the urgency of tasks in the queue. At high levels of
overload, some alternative algorithms produce slightly higher value, but at the
cost of a hugely higher number of starved workflows.

Chapter 3 contains an introduction to the Hamiltonian formulation of gauge
theories in the context of Maxwell theory. The knowledge gained in Chapter 3 is
applied to general relativity in Chapter 4. The Hamiltonian is shown to acquire
a surface term due to the presence of the boundary. The geometrical properties
of anti-de Sitter space and the BTZ black hole are the subject of Chapter 5.
The main part of the discussion follows in Chapter 6, which contains the
calculation of the central charge in the asymptotic symmetry algebra of
asymptotically AdS3 space-times. After some preliminaries on the AdS/CFT
correspondence and Chern-Simons theory, the derivation of the boundary
conformal field theory is summarized in Chapter 7. Finally, Strominger's
entropy calculation is presented in Chapter 8, along with some comments on this
approach.

Individual health can be tracked by the accumulation of age-related health

age in predicting mortality. In this paper, we use a dynamical network model of
deficits to explore the effects of interactions between deficits, deficit
damage and repair processes, and the connection between the F and mortality.
With our model, we qualitatively reproduce Gompertz's law of increasing human
mortality with age, the broadening of the F distribution with age, the
characteristic non-linear increase of the F with age, and the increased
mortality of high-frailty individuals. No explicit time-dependence in damage or
repair rates is needed in our model. Instead, implicit time-dependence arises
through deficit interactions -- so that the average deficit damage rates
increases, and deficit repair rates decreases, with age . We use a simple
mortality criterion, where mortality occurs when the most connected node is
damaged.

parallel HPC hardware compared to standard Krylov subspace methods for large
and sparse linear systems. In pipelined methods the traditional synchronization
bottleneck is mitigated by overlapping time-consuming global communications
with useful computations. However, to achieve this communication hiding
strategy, pipelined methods introduce additional recurrence relations for a
number of auxiliary variables that are required to update the approximate
solution. This paper aims at studying the influence of local rounding errors
that are introduced by the additional recurrences in the pipelined Conjugate
Gradient method. Specifically, we analyze the impact of local round-off effects
on the attainable accuracy of the pipelined CG algorithm and compare to the
traditional CG method. Furthermore, we estimate the gap between the true
residual and the recursively computed residual used in the algorithm. Based on
this estimate we suggest an automated residual replacement strategy to reduce
the loss of attainable accuracy on the final iterative solution. The resulting
pipelined CG method with residual replacement improves the maximal attainable
accuracy of pipelined CG, while maintaining the efficient parallel performance
of the pipelined method. This conclusion is substantiated by numerical results
for a variety of benchmark problems.

such a situation, the t_2g manifold of iridates, and show that, while the
Jahn-Teller effect does indeed not affect the j_eff=1/2 antiferromagnetically
ordered ground state, it leads to distinctive signatures in the j_eff=3/2
spin-orbit exciton. It allows for a hopping of the spin-orbit exciton between
the nearest neighbor sites without producing defects in the j_eff=1/2
antiferromagnet. This arises because the lattice-driven Jahn-Teller mechanism
only couples to the orbital degree of freedom, but is not sensitive to the
phase of the wave function that defines isospin j_z. This contrasts sharply
with purely electronic propagation, which conserves isospin, and presence of
Jahn-Teller coupling can explain some of the peculiar features of measured
resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra of Sr_2IrO_4.

initial conditions for an instance of the game: its behaviour for an exhaustive
set of pairings of popular UK childrens' names, and for more general initial
conditions, is examined. Convergence to a fixed outcome (the desired result) is
not guaranteed, even for some plausible first name pairings. No pairs of top-50
common first names exhibit non-convergence, suggesting that it is rare in the
playground; however, including surnames makes non-convergence more likely due
to higher letter counts (for example, `Reese Witherspoon LOVES Calvin Harris').
Different game keywords (including from different languages) are also
considered. An estimate for non-convergence propensity is derived: if the sum
$m$ of digits in a string of length $w$ obeys $m > 18/(3/2)^{w-4}$, convergence
is less likely. Pairs of top UK names with pairs of `O's and several `L's (for

When considering individual names playing with a range of partners, those with

robust mathematical alternative for predicting the UCS of carbonate rocks. The
two parameters of total porosity and P-wave speed were selected as predictive

used approaches by proposing a mathematical model, similar to a regression,
while keeping the prediction errors as low as the black box methods. The GEP
outperformed both artificial neural networks and support vector machines in
terms of yielding more accurate estimates of UCS. Both the porosity and the
P-wave velocity were sufficient predictive indices for estimating the UCS of

This method is developed by modifying the Fourier filtering method. The
robustness of this method is proved by generating two coupled fractional
Brownian motions and extending its range of application to Gaussian random
fields.

challenge to digital forensic investigations. Currently, evidence acquisition
for such services still follows the traditional method of collecting artifacts
on a client device. This approach requires labor-intensive reverse engineering
efforts, and ultimately results in an acquisition that is inherently
incomplete. Specifically, it makes the incorrect assumption that all storage
content for an account is fully replicated on the client; further, there are no
means to acquire historical data in the form of document revisions, nor is
there a way to acquire cloud-native artifacts, such as Google Docs.
  In this work, we introduce the concept of API-based evidence acquisition for
cloud services, which addresses these concerns by utilizing the officially
supported API of the service. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we
present a proof-of-concept acquisition tool, kumodd, which can acquire evidence
from four major cloud drive providers: Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive,
Dropbox, and Box. The implementation provides both command-line and web user
interfaces, and can be readily incorporated into established forensic
processes.

  Networks","Review and performance evaluation work","Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 43, pp.66-75 (2014)","10.1016/j.jnca.2014.04.007",,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) has been profusely used by most of
internet applications. Since 1970s, several TCP variants have been developed in
order to cope with the fast increasing of network capacities especially in high
Bandwidth Delay Product (high-BDP) networks. In these TCP variants, several
approaches have been used, some of these approaches have the ability to
estimate available bandwidths and some react based on network loss and/or delay
changes. This variety of the used approaches arises many consequent problems
with different levels of dependability and accuracy. Indeed, a particular TCP
variant which is proper for wireless networks, may not fit for high-BDP wired
networks and vice versa. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a comparison
between the high-speed TCP variants that have a high level of importance
especially after the fast growth of networks bandwidths. In this paper,
high-speed TCP variants, that are implemented in Linux and available for
research, have been evaluated using NS2 network simulator. This performance
evaluation presents the advantages and disadvantages of these TCP variants in
terms of throughput, loss-ratio and fairness over high-BDP networks. The
results reveal that, CUBIC and YeAH overcome the other highspeed TCP variants
in different cases of buffer size. However, they still require more improvement
to extend their ability to fully utilize the high-speed bandwidths, especially
when the applied buffer is near-zero or less than the BDP of the link.
