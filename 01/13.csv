several classes of optical quantum communication such as point-to-point

protocols. Recently, Takeoka, Guha and Wilde (TGW) have presented a fundamental
rate-loss tradeoff on quantum communication capacity and secret key agreement
capacity of any lossy channel assisted by unlimited forward and backward
classical communication [Nat. Commun. 5, 5235 (2014)]. However, this bound is
applicable only to the simplest class of quantum communication, i.e., the

the potential of a `worldwide' quantum network. Here we generalize the TGW

positive measures, whose parameters can be computed explicitly (rather than
estimated by optimization), and illustrate its applicability to a wide range of
data types. The pre-processing step then consists of representing data sets as
simple measures. The theoretical foundation consists of a dyadic product
formula representation lemma, a visualization theorem. We also define an
additive multiscale noise model which can be used to sample from dyadic
measures and a more general multiplicative multiscale noise model which can be
used to perturb continuous functions, Borel measures, and dyadic measures. The
first two results are based on theorems. The representation uses the very
simple concept of a dyadic tree, and hence is widely applicable, easily
understood, and easily computed. Since the data sample is represented as a
measure, subsequent analysis can exploit statistical and measure theoretic
concepts and theories. Because the representation uses the very simple concept
of a dyadic tree defined on the universe of a data set and the parameters are
simply and explicitly computable and easily interpretable and visualizable, we
hope that this approach will be broadly useful to mathematicians,
statisticians, and computer scientists who are intrigued by or involved in data
science including its mathematical foundations.

efficient coding of position, which takes into account the temporal statistics
of the animal's motion. The theory predicts a sharp decrease of module
population sizes with grid spacing, in agreement with the trends seen in the

code by neural circuitry, that can match in accuracy the optimal Bayesian
decoder of the spikes. This readout scheme requires persistence over varying
timescales, ranging from ~1ms to ~1s, depending on the grid cell module. Our
results suggest that the brain employs an efficient representation of position

these measurements, combined with local atomic clock tests and Type Ia
supernova and Hubble parameter data, were used to constrain the simplest class
of dynamical dark energy models where the same degree of freedom is assumed to
provide both the dark energy and (through a dimensionless coupling, $\zeta$, to
the electromagnetic sector) the $\alpha$ variation. One caveat of these
analyses was that it was based on fiducial models where the dark energy
equation of state was described by a single parameter (effectively its present
day value, $w_0$). Here we relax this assumption and study broader dark energy
model classes, including the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder and Early Dark Energy
parametrizations. Even in these extended cases we find that the current data
constrains the coupling $\zeta$ at the $10^{-6}$ level and $w_0$ to a few
percent (marginalizing over other parameters), thus confirming the robustness
of earlier analyses. On the other hand, the additional parameters are typically
not well constrained. We also highlight the implications of our results for
constraints on violations of the Weak Equivalence Principle and improvements to
be expected from forthcoming measurements with high-resolution ultra-stable

is to use the Berends-Giele recursion relation involving off-shell currents or
off-shell amplitudes, if working in the light cone gauge. As shown in recent
works using the light-front perturbation theory, solutions to these recursions
naturally collapse into gauge invariant and gauge-dependent components, at
least for some helicity configurations. In this work, we show that such
structure is helicity independent and emerges from analytic properties of
matrix elements of Wilson line operators, where the slope of the straight gauge
path is shifted in a certain complex direction. This is similar to the
procedure leading to the Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten (BCFW) recursion, however
we apply a complex shift to the Wilson line slope instead of the external
momenta. While in the original BCFW procedure the boundary integrals over the
complex shift vanish for certain deformations, here they are non-zero and are
equal to the off-shell amplitudes. The main result can thus be summarized as
follows: we derive a decomposition of a helicity-fixed off-shell current into
gauge invariant component given by a matrix element of a straight Wilson line
plus a reminder given by a sum of products of gauge invariant and gauge
dependent quantities. We give several examples realizing this relation,
including the five-point next-to-MHV helicity configuration.

appearance of a dissipationless supercurrent in a weak link between two
superconducting (S) electrodes. While the mechanism leading to the Josephson
effect is quite general, i.e., Andreev reflections at the interface between the
S electrodes and the weak link, the precise physical details and topology of
the junction drastically modify the properties of the supercurrent.
Specifically, a strong enhancement of the critical supercurrent $I_C$ is
expected to occur when the topology of the junction allows the emergence of
Majorana bound states. Here we report charge transport measurements in
mesoscopic Josephson junctions formed by InAs nanowires and Ti/Al
superconducting leads. Our main observation is a colossal enhancement of the
critical supercurrent induced by an external magnetic field applied
perpendicular to the substrate. This striking and anomalous supercurrent
enhancement cannot be ascribed to any known conventional phenomenon existing in
Josephson junctions including, for instance, Fraunhofer-like diffraction or a
$\pi$-state behavior. We also investigate an unconventional model related to
inhomogenous Zeeman field caused by magnetic focusing, and note that it can not
account for the observed behaviour. Finally, we consider these results in the
context of topological superconductivity, and show that the observed $I_C$
enhancement is compatible with a magnetic field-induced topological transition
of the junction.

integers. It is generally assumed that the spectrum $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$

what geometry this object carries. A.Connes and C.Consani published recently an

  Our approach is based on the generalisation of constructions applied by the
first author for similar purposes in non-commutative (and commutative)
algebraic geometry.
  The current version is quite basic. We describe a category of certain
representations of integral extensions of $\Z$ and establish its tight
connection with the space of elementary theories of pseudo-finite fields. From
model-theoretic point of view the category of representations is a multisorted
structure which we prove to be superstable with pregeometry of trivial type. It
comes as some surprise that a structure like this can code a rich mathematics

that their dynamics differ considerably from the dynamics of other
photocurrents which are expected to follow the temporal shape of the optical

relaxation on the magneto-photocurrents. Our measurements show that the
anisotropy relaxation for carrier densities ranging between $10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$
and $5 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$ occurs on two different time scales. While the
slow time constant is approximately 100 fs long and most likely governed by
electron-phonon scattering, the fast time constant is on the order of 10 fs and
presumably linked to the valence band. Our studies not only help to better
understand the microscopic origins of optically induced currents but - being

stability conditions then so does the equivalent medium. We examine---within

the product of averages, which underlies the averaging process.

reliably converges to stored patterns which contain the memory. However, it is
unclear how the behavior is controlled by the brain so that after convergence
to one configuration, it can proceed with recognition of another one. In the
Hopfield model this happens only through unrealistic changes of an effective
global temperature that destabilizes all stored configurations. Here we show
that spike frequency adaptation (SFA), a common mechanism affecting neuron
activation in the brain, can provide state dependent control of pattern
retrieval. We demonstrate this in a Hopfield network modified to include SFA,
and also in a model network of biophysical neurons. In both cases SFA allows
for selective stabilization of attractors with different basins of attraction,
and also for temporal dynamics of attractor switching that is not possible in
standard auto-associative schemes. The dynamics of our models give a plausible

Accepted in Icarus",,"10.1016/j.icarus.2016.01.013",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In its decade of operation the Cassini mission has allowed us to look deep
into Saturn's atmosphere and investigate the processes occurring below its
enshrouding haze. We use Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS)
4.6-5.2 micron data from early in the mission to investigate the location and
properties of Saturn's cloud structure between 0.6 and 5 bars. We average
nightside spectra from 2006 over latitude circles and model the spectral limb
darkening using the NEMESIS radiative transfer and retrieval tool. We present
our best-fit deep cloud model for latitudes between -40 and 50 degrees, along
with retrieved abundances for NH3, PH3 and AsH3. We find an increase in NH3
abundance at the equator, a cloud base at ~2.3 bar and no evidence for cloud
particles with strong absorption features in the 4.6-5.2 micron wavelength
range, all of which are consistent with previous work. Non-scattering cloud
models assuming a composition of either NH3 or NH4SH, with a scattering haze
overlying, fit limb darkening curves and spectra at all latitudes well; the
retrieved optical depth for the tropospheric haze is decreased in the northern
(winter) hemisphere, implying that the haze has a photochemical origin. Our
ability to test this hypothesis by examining spectra at different seasons is
restricted by the varying geometry of VIMS observations over the life of the
mission, and the appearance of the Saturn storm towards the end of 2010.

describe a formation of fermion three-quark (nucleons and $\Delta$-baryons) and
boson (two-quark mesons, six-quark deuterons) bound states and also a formation
of a topologically nontrivial phase. At finite hadron density, the model has a
rich phase diagram which includes phases with density wave and superfluid
quasi-long-range (QLR) order and also a phase of a baryon Tomonaga-Luttinger
liquid (strange metal). The QLR order results as a condensation of scalar
mesons (the density wave) or six-quark bound states (deuterons).

  Astroparticle Physics",,"10.1016/j.astropartphys.2016.01.002",,"astro-ph.IM astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Various experiments have been conducted to search for the radio emission from
ultra-high-energy particles interacting in the lunar regolith. Although they
have not yielded any detections, they have been successful in establishing
upper limits on the flux of these particles. I present a review of these
experiments in which I re-evaluate their sensitivity to radio pulses,
accounting for effects which were neglected in the original reports, and
compare them with prospective near-future experiments. In several cases, I find
that past experiments were substantially less sensitive than previously
believed. I apply existing analytic models to determine the resulting limits on
the fluxes of ultra-high-energy neutrinos and cosmic rays. In the latter case,
I amend the model to accurately reflect the fraction of the primary particle
energy which manifests in the resulting particle cascade, resulting in a
substantial improvement in the estimated sensitivity to cosmic rays. Although
these models are in need of further refinement, in particular to incorporate
the effects of small-scale lunar surface roughness, their application here
indicates that a proposed experiment with the LOFAR telescope would test
predictions of the neutrino flux from exotic-physics models, and an experiment
with a phased-array feed on a large single-dish telescope such as the Parkes
radio telescope would allow the first detection of cosmic rays with this
technique, with an expected rate of one detection per 140 hours.

INT/WFC Photometric H-alpha Survey of the Northern Galactic Plane, we present
incompleteness-corrected stellar density maps in the r and i photometric bands.
These have been computed to a range of limiting magnitudes reaching to 20th
magnitude in r and 19th in i (Vega system), and with different angular
resolutions -- the highest resolution available being 1 square arcminute. The
maps obtained cover 94 percent of the 1800 square-degree IPHAS footprint,
spanning the Galactic latitude range, -5{\deg} < b < +5{\deg}, north of the
celestial equator. The corrections for incompleteness, due to confusion and
sensitivity loss at the faint limit, have been deduced by the method of
artificial source injection. The presentation of this method is preceded by a
discussion of other more approximate methods of determining completeness. Our
method takes full account of position-dependent seeing and source ellipticity
in the survey database. The application of the star counts to testing reddened
Galactic disc models is previewed by a comparison with predicted counts along
three constant-longitude cuts at l $\simeq$ 30{\deg}, 90{\deg} and 175{\deg}:
some over-prediction of the most heavily reddened l $\simeq$ 30{\deg} counts is
found, alongside good agreement at l $\simeq$ 90{\deg} and 175{\deg}.

hydrogen and its associated ions. Because the chemical pathways leading to the
formation of interstellar hydrides are relatively simple, the analysis of the

understanding the temporal variability of magnetic energy redistribution and

Dynamics Observatory's} Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and Heliosemic Magnetic
Imager; radiative and magnetic fluxes were measured from gross features and at
full-disk scales, respectively. Magnetic energy coupling analyses support
radiative flux descriptions via a plasma heating connectivity of dominant
(magnetic) and diffuse components, specifically of the predominantly closed
field corona. Our work shows that this relationship favors an energetic
redistribution efficiency across large temperature gradients, and potentially
sheds light on the long withstanding issue of diffuse unresolved low corona
emission. The intimacy of magnetic energy redistribution and plasma conditions
revealed by this work holds significant insight for the field of stellar

of meeting the high data-rate requirements in next-generation wireless systems.
The focus of this work is on low-complexity beamforming approaches for initial
UE discovery in such systems. Towards this goal, we first note the structure of
the optimal beamformer with per-antenna gain and phase control and the
structure of good beamformers with per-antenna phase-only control. Learning
these beamforming structures in mmW systems is fraught with considerable
complexities such as the need for a non-broadcast system design, the
sensitivity of the beamformer approximants to small path length changes, etc.
To overcome these issues, we establish a physical interpretation between these
beamformer structures and the angles of departure/arrival of the dominant
path(s). This physical interpretation provides a theoretical underpinning to
the emerging interest on directional beamforming approaches that are less
sensitive to small path length changes. While classical approaches for
direction learning such as MUSIC have been well-understood, they suffer from
many practical difficulties in a mmW context such as a non-broadcast system
design and high computational complexity. A simpler broadcast solution for mmW
systems is the adaptation of directional codebooks for beamforming at the two
ends. We establish fundamental limits for the best beam broadening codebooks
and propose a construction motivated by a virtual subarray architecture that is
within a couple of dB of the best tradeoff curve at all useful beam broadening
factors. We finally provide the received SNR loss-UE discovery latency tradeoff
with the proposed constructions. Our results show that users with a reasonable
link margin can be quickly discovered by the proposed design with a smooth
roll-off in performance as the link margin deteriorates.

techniques. A topological superconducting phase with four Majorana fermions
occurs until moderate interactions between chains. For large interactions, both
repulsive and attractive, by analogy with the Hubbard model, we identify Mott
phases with Ising type magnetic order. For repulsive interactions, the Ising
antiferromagnetic order favors the occurrence of orbital currents spontaneously
breaking time-reversal symmetry. By strongly varying the chemical potentials of
the two chains, quantum phase transitions towards fully polarized (empty or
full) fermionic chains occur. In the Kitaev model, the quantum critical point
separating the topological superconducting phase and the polarized phase
belongs to the universality class of the critical Ising model in two
dimensions. When increasing the Coulomb interaction between chains, then we
identify an additional phase corresponding to two critical Ising theories (or
two chains of Majorana fermions). We confirm the existence of such a phase from
exact mappings and from the concept of bipartite fluctuations. We show the
existence of negative logarithmic corrections in the bipartite fluctuations, as
a reminiscence of the quantum critical point in the Kitaev model. Other
entanglement probes such as bipartite entropy and entanglement spectrum are
also used to characterize the phase diagram. The limit of large interactions
can be reached in an equivalent setup of ultra-cold atoms and Josephson

significantly higher sputter yield of ~50%. Binary collision theory applied to
monolayer and few-layer graphene can successfully elucidate this collision
mechanism, in great agreement with experiments. Raman spectroscopy analysis
corroborates the passage of a large fraction of He+ ions across graphene

ELM loads on divertor was observed on DIII-D and MAST: the power is deposited
predominantly in the footprint structures formed by the magnetic perturbation.
In the present contribution we develop a theory explaining this effect, based
on the idea that part of the ELM loss is caused by parallel transport in the
homoclinic tangle formed by the magnetic perturbation of the ELM. The modified
tangle resulting from the combination of the ELM perturbation and the applied
RMP has the expected property of bringing open field lines in the same areas as
the tangle from the RMP alone. We show that this explanation is consistent with
features of the mitigated ELMs on MAST.
  We in addition validated our theory by an analysis of simulations of
mitigated ELMs using the code JOREK. We produced detailed laminar plots of
field lines on the divertor in the JOREK runs with an ELM, an applied RMP, and
an ELM mitigated by the presence of the RMP. The results for an ELM clearly
show a high-n rotating footprint structure appearing during the nonlinear stage
of the ELM, which is not present in the early stage of the ELM. The results for
a n=2 RMP from the ELM control coils show the expected n=2 footprint structure.
The results for the mitigated ELM show a similar structure, modulated by a
higher n perturbation of the ELM, consistent with our theory.

reveals presence of the global spiral arms of significant amplitude, likely
excited by massive planets or stellar companions. Assuming that these arms are
density waves, evolving into spiral shocks, we assess their effect on the
thermodynamics, accretion, and global evolution of the disk. We derive
analytical expressions for the direct (irreversible) heating, angular momentum
transport, and mass accretion rate induced by the disk shocks of arbitrary
strength. We find these processes to be very sensitive to the shock amplitude.
Focusing on the waves of moderate strength (density jump at the shock
$\Delta\Sigma/\Sigma\sim 1$) we show the associated disk heating to be
negligible (contributing at $\sim 1\%$ level to the energy budget) in passive,
irradiated protoplanetary disks on $\sim 100$ AU scales, but becoming important
within several AU from the star. At the same time, shock heating can be a
significant (or even dominant) energy source in disks of cataclysmic variables,
stellar X-ray binaries, and supermassive black hole binaries, heated mainly by
viscous dissipation. Mass accretion induced by the global spiral shocks is
comparable to (or exceeds) the mass inflow due to viscous stresses.
Protoplanetary disks featuring prominent global spirals must be evolving
rapidly, in $\lesssim 0.5$ Myr at $\sim 100$ AU. A direct upper limit on the
disk evolution timescale can be established via the measurement of the
gravitational torque due to the spiral arms from the imaging data. Our findings
suggest that, regardless of their origin, global spiral waves must be important
agents of the protoplanetary disk evolution. They may serve as an effective
mechanism of disk dispersal and could be related to the transitional disk
phenomenon.

Astronomers already have developed solutions to tackle several science

problems emerge and it is critical to be able to re-use the models learned
before, without rebuilding everything from the beginning when the science

can not be used since each expert (model) uses different inputs. We also
consider computational complexity of the model by using the most expensive

an ensemble approach for the asset correlations. Consistently with the data, we

fluctuations around this average value. Yet, the resulting asset value

magnitude and direction are both determined by the Mn spin current, where the
\emph{p}-\emph{d} orbital mixing is driven by the inequivalent exchange

observed and may result in increased breathing effort, compromising the
patient's comfort and recovery. This circumstance requires clinical
intervention and becomes challenging when verbal communication is difficult. In
this work, we propose a brain computer interface (BCI) to automatically and
non-invasively detect patient-ventilator disharmony from
electroencephalographic (EEG) signals: a brain-ventilator interface (BVI). Our
framework exploits the cortical activation provoked by the inspiratory
compensation when the subject and the ventilator are desynchronized. Use of a
one-class approach and Riemannian geometry of EEG covariance matrices allows
effective classification of respiratory states. The BVI is validated on nine
healthy subjects that performed different respiratory tasks that mimic a
patient-ventilator disharmony. Classification performances, in terms of areas
under ROC curves, are significantly improved using EEG signals compared to
detection based on air flow. Reduction in the number of electrodes that can
achieve discrimination can often be desirable (e.g. for portable BCI systems).
By using an iterative channel selection technique, the Common Highest Order
Ranking (CHOrRa), we find that a reduced set of electrodes (n=6) can slightly
improve for an intra-subject configuration, and it still provides fairly good
performances for a general inter-subject setting. Results support the
discriminant capacity of our approach to identify anomalous respiratory states,
by learning from a training set containing only normal respiratory epochs. The
proposed framework opens the door to brain-ventilator interfaces for monitoring
patient's breathing comfort and adapting ventilator parameters to patient
respiratory needs.

that samples the equilibrium thermal state of a Quantum Annealing (QA)
Hamiltonian. In addition to simulating quantum systems, SQA has also been
proposed as another physics-inspired classical algorithm for combinatorial
optimization, alongside classical simulated annealing. However, in many cases
it remains an open challenge to determine the performance of both QA and SQA.
One piece of evidence for the strength of QA over classical simulated annealing
comes from an example by Farhi, Goldstone and Gutmann . There a bit-symmetric
cost function with a thin, high energy barrier was designed to show an
exponential seperation between classical simulated annealing, for which thermal
fluctuations take exponential time to climb the barrier, and quantum annealing
which passes through the barrier and reaches the global minimum in poly time,
arguably by taking advantage of quantum tunneling. In this work we apply a
comparison method to rigorously show that the Markov chain underlying SQA
efficiently samples the target distribution and finds the global minimum of
this spike cost function in polynomial time. Our work provides evidence for the
growing consensus that SQA inherits at least some of the advantages of
tunneling in QA, and so QA is unlikely to achieve exponential speedups over
classical computing solely by the use of quantum tunneling. Since we analyze
only a particular model this evidence is not decisive. However, techniques
applied here---including warm starts from the adiabatic path and the use of the
quantum ground state probability distribution to understand the stationary
distribution of SQA---may be valuable for future studies of the performance of
SQA on cost functions for which QA is efficient.

The theorem is stronger than Lovelock's in two ways: it holds in all
dimensions, and so supports a generalized argument for uniqueness; it does not
assume that the desired tensor depends on the metric only up second-order
partial-derivatives, that condition being a consequence of the proof. This has
consequences for understanding the nature of the cosmological constant and
theories of higher-dimensional gravity. Another consequence of the theorem is
that it makes precise the sense in which there can be no gravitational

dispersing the surrounding dense gas and therefore in limiting the efficiency

shell expansion adopts the static solutions of Draine (2011) for dusty H II
regions and considers the contact outward forces on the shell due to radiation
and thermal pressures as well as the inward gravity from the central star and
the shell itself. We show that the internal structure we adopt and the shell
evolution from the semi-analytic approach are in good agreement with the
results of numerical simulations. Strong radiation pressure in the interior
controls the shell expansion indirectly by enhancing the density and pressure
at the ionization front. We calculate the minimum star formation efficiency
$\epsilon_{min}$ required for cloud disruption as a function of the cloud's
total mass and mean surface density. Within the adopted spherical geometry, we
find that typical giant molecular clouds in normal disk galaxies have
$\epsilon_{min} \lesssim 10$%, with comparable gas and radiation pressure
effects on shell expansion. Massive cluster-forming clumps require a
significantly higher efficiency of $\epsilon_{min} \gtrsim 50$% for disruption,
produced mainly by radiation-driven expansion. The disruption time is typically
of the order of a free-fall timescale, suggesting that the cloud disruption
occurs rapidly once a sufficiently luminous H II region is formed. We also
discuss limitations of the spherical idealization.

emission line-based SFRs for H II galaxies. Other classes, such as active
galaxies and evolved galaxies, exhibit systematic discrepancies between optical
and TIR SFRs. We demonstrate that these offsets are attributable primarily to
survey biases and the large intrinsic uncertainties of the D4000- and
colour-based optical calibrations used to estimate the SDSS SFRs of these
galaxies. Using a classification scheme which expands upon popular
emission-line methods, we demonstrate that emission-line galaxies with
uncertain classifications include a population of massive, dusty, metal-rich

study the capabilities of infrared selection of star-forming galaxies. FIR

events in the life cycle of galaxies. We show here the first evidence that the
Milky Way experienced a generalised quenching of its star formation at the end
of its thick disk formation $\sim$9 Gyr ago. Elemental abundances of stars
studied as part of the APOGEE survey reveal indeed that in less than $\sim$2
Gyr the star formation rate in our Galaxy dropped by an order-of-magnitude.
Because of the tight correlation between age and alpha abundance, this event
reflects in the dearth of stars along the inner disk sequence in the
[Fe/H]-[$\alpha$/Fe] plane. Before this phase, which lasted about 1.5 Gyr, the
Milky Way was actively forming stars. Afterwards, the star formation resumed at
a much lower level to form the thin disk. These events are very well matched by
the latest observation of MW-type progenitors at high redshifts. In late type
galaxies, quenching is believed to be related to a long and secular exhaustion
of gas. In our Galaxy, it occurred on a much shorter time scale, while the
chemical continuity before and after the quenching indicates that it was not
due to the exhaustion of the gas. While quenching is generally associated with
spheroids, our results show that it also occurs in galaxies like the Milky Way,
possibly when they are undergoing a morphological transition from thick to thin
disks. Given the demographics of late type galaxies in the local universe, in
which classical bulges are rare, we suggest further that this may hold true
generally in galaxies with mass lower than or approximately $M^*$, where
quenching could be directly a consequence of thick disk formation. We emphasize
that the quenching phase in the Milky Way could be contemporaneous with, and
related to, the formation of the bar. We sketch a scenario on how a strong bar
may inhibit star formation.

observations from a ground-based network of wide-field survey telescopes would
have several major advantages. First, it would enable full two-dimensional
(2-D) vector microlens parallax measurements for a substantial fraction of
low-mass lenses as well as planetary and binary events that show caustic
crossing features. For a significant fraction of the free-floating planet (FFP)
events and all caustic-crossing planetary/binary events, these 2-D parallax
measurements directly lead to complete solutions (mass, distance, transverse
velocity) of the lens object (or lens system). For even more events, the
complementary ground-based observations will yield 1-D parallax measurements.
Together with the 1-D parallaxes from \emph{WFIRST} alone, they can probe the
entire mass range $M\gtrsim M_\oplus$. For luminous lenses, such 1-D parallax
measurements can be promoted to complete solutions (mass, distance, transverse
velocity) by high-resolution imaging. This would provide crucial information
not only about the hosts of planets and other lenses, but also enable a much
more precise Galactic model. Other benefits of such a survey include improved
understanding of binaries (particularly with low mass primaries), and
sensitivity to distant ice-giant and gas-giant companions of \emph{WFIRST}
lenses that cannot be detected by \emph{WFIRST} itself due to its restricted
observing windows. Existing ground-based microlensing surveys can be employed
if \emph{WFIRST} is pointed at lower-extinction fields than is currently
envisaged. This would come at some cost to the event rate. Therefore the
benefits of improved characterization of lenses must be weighed against these
costs.

focusing on the production of charm particles that carry a large fraction of
the momentum of the incident proton. In the case of strange particles, such a
component is familiar from the abundant production of $K^+\Lambda$ pairs.
Modern collider experiments have no coverage in the very large rapidity region
where the forward pair production dominates. While forward charm particles are
produced inside the LHC beampipe, they dominate the high-energy atmospheric
neutrino flux in underground experiments because long-lived pions and kaons
interact before decaying into neutrinos. The fragmentation of the spectator
quark in the partonic subprocesses $qc \rightarrow qc$ and $gc \rightarrow gc$
is responsible for the forward component of charm production in perturbative
QCD. We use this phenomenological framework to construct a charm cross section
that saturates available accelerator and cosmic ray data, i.e., it represents
an upper limit on the normalization of the charm cross section that cannot be
reliably calculated because the charm mass is much smaller than the
center-of-mass energy. Where the highest energy IceCube observations are
concerned, we conclude that the upper limit on the flux of neutrinos from
forward charm production may dominate the much-studied central component. It
may therefore also represent a significant contribution to the TeV atmospheric

the axion abundance or highly super-Planckian $f_I$ that somehow does not
dominate the inflationary energy density. Models that have enhanced explicit
breaking of the PQ symmetry during inflation may allow $f_a$ close to the
Planck scale. Avoiding disruption of inflationary dynamics provides important
limits on the parameter space.

Building on a diverse body of work, we upgrade the Flexible Modeling System

generate plausible, three-dimensional structures of irradiated atmospheres to
study the radiative effects of aerosols or condensates. In the optical, we
treat the scattering of starlight using a generalisation of Beer's law that
allows for a finite Bond albedo to be prescribed. In the infrared, we implement
the two-stream solutions and include scattering via an infrared scattering
parameter. We present a suite of four-parameter general circulation models for
Kepler-7b and demonstrate that its climatology is expected to be robust to
variations in optical and infrared scattering. The westward and eastward shifts
of the optical and infrared phase curves, respectively, are shown to be robust
outcomes of the simulations. Assuming micron-sized particles and a simplified
treatment of local brightness, we further show that the peak offset of the
optical phase curve is sensitive to the composition of the aerosols or
condensates. However, to within the measurement uncertainties, we cannot
distinguish between aerosols made of silicates (enstatite or forsterite), iron,
corundum or titanium oxide, based on a comparison to the measured peak offset

new high-mass white dwarfs and analyze the initial-final mass relation (IFMR),
we have also looked at 30 white dwarfs from publicly available data that are
mostly all high-mass ($\gtrsim$0.9 M$_\odot$). These original published data
exhibited significant scatter, and to test if this scatter is true or simply
the result of systematics, we have uniformly analyzed the white dwarf spectra
and have adopted thorough photometric techniques to derive uniform cluster
parameters for their parent clusters. The resulting IFMR scatter is
significantly reduced, arguing that mass-loss rates are not stochastic in
nature and that within the ranges of metallicity and mass analyzed in this work
mass loss is not highly sensitive to variations in metallicity. Lastly, when
adopting cluster ages based on Y$^2$ isochrones, the slope of the high-mass
IFMR remains steep and consistent with that found from intermediate-mass white
dwarfs, giving a linear IFMR from progenitor masses between 3 to 6.5 M$_\odot$.

the available 1 solar mass tracks (computed before the recent solar composition
revision by Asplund et al.) can be covered by tracks between 0.97-1.01 solar
masses computed with the STARS code. We assess some possible causes of the
origin of this uncertainty, including how the choice of input physics and the
solar constraints used to perform the solar calibration affect the tracks. We
find that for a 1 solar mass track, uncertainties of around 10% in the initial
hydrogen abundance and initial metallicity produce around a 2% error in mass.
For the 3 solar mass tracks, there is very little difference between the tracks
from the various different stellar codes. The main difference comes in the
extent of the main sequence, which we believe results from the different
choices of the implementation of convective overshooting in the core.
Uncertainties in the initial abundances lead to a 1-2% error in the mass
determination. These uncertainties cover only part of the total error budget,
which should also include uncertainties in the input physics (e.g., reaction
rates, opacities, convective models) and any missing physics (e.g., radiative
levitation, rotation, magnetic fields). Uncertainties in stellar surface
properties such as luminosity and effective temperature will further reduce the
accuracy of any potential mass determinations.

redshift between the two objects; on the other hand, there are clear
differences in the emission line profiles and in the multiwavelength spectral

bright given their proximity (a projected separation of ~135 kpc), with i=19.4

luminous quasars are extremely rare at z=5; the existence of this pair suggests
that quasars have strong small-scale clustering at high redshift. Assuming a

deep field south. We collect star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic
nuclei (AGN) with accurate spectroscopic redshifts, for which Hubble Space

We selected a sample of about 200 sources at z~3. Taking advantage of HST
resolution, we applied a careful cleaning procedure and rejected sources
showing nearby clumps with different colours, which could be lower-z
interlopers. Our clean sample consisted of 86 SFGs (including 19 narrow-band
selected Lya emitters) and 8 AGN (including 6 detected in X-rays). We measured
the LyC flux from aperture photometry in four narrow-band filters covering
wavelengths below a 912 A rest frame (3.11<z<3.53). We estimated the ratio
between ionizing (LyC flux) and 1400 A non-ionizing emissions for AGN and
galaxies. Results: By running population synthesis models, we assume an average
intrinsic L(1400 A)/L(900 A) ratio of 5 as the representative value for our
sample. With this value and an average treatment of the lines of sight of the
inter-galactic medium, we estimate the LyC escape fraction relative to the
intrinsic value (fesc_rel(LyC)). We do not directly detect ionizing radiation
from any individual SFG, but we are able to set a 1(2)sigma upper limit of
fesc_rel(LyC)<12(24)%. This result is consistent with other non-detections
published in the literature. No meaningful limits can be calculated for the
sub-sample of Lya emitters. We obtain one significant direct detection for an
AGN at z=3.46, with fesc_rel(LyC) = (72+/-18)%. Conclusions: Our upper limit on
fescrel(LyC) implies that the SFGs studied here do not present either the
physical properties or the geometric conditions suitable for efficient
LyC-photon escape.

heating is not saturated during the epoch of reionization, assuming that the

not a good tracer of the reionization history.

Specifically, the proposed scheduler prioritizes service to ED data while
ensuring that the PU packets meet their service deadline. It also minimizes
successive PU failures for critical applications by penalizing their
occurrences. Furthermore, the failed PU packets are immediately cleared from

Cosmic Ray (CR) propagation within the Galaxy. These ratios estimate the
grammage that the CR traverse as they propagate from their sources to Earth.
Attempts to explain these ratios within the standard CR propagation models
require ad hoc modifications and even with those these models necessitate
inconsistent grammages to explain both ratios. As an alternative, physically
motivated model, we have proposed that CR originate preferably within the
galactic spiral arms. CR propagation from dynamic spiral arms has important
imprints on various secondary to primary ratios, such as the B/C ratio and the
positron fraction. We use our spiral arm diffusion model with the spallation
network extended up to Nickel to calculate the sub-Fe/Fe ratio. We show that
without any additional parameters the spiral arm model consistently explains
both ratios with the same grammage, providing further evidence in favor of this

While specific applications are successful, the validity of information as a

of success and a player trying to maximize cumulative payoff by choosing the

galaxies that show signs of star formation. The studied sample of star-forming
galaxies spans a redshift range from 0.094 to 1.475 with stellar masses in the
range 10$^{8}-$10$^{12}$ $M_{\odot}$. The sample also includes eight broad
emission line galaxies with redshifts between 1.5 $<z<$ 3.0.
  Methods. We derived star formation rates (SFRs) from emission line
luminosities and investigated the dependence of the SFR and specific SFR (SSFR)
on the stellar mass and color. Furthermore, we investigated the evolution of
these relations with the redshift.
  Results. We found that the SFR correlates with the stellar mass, our data is
consistent with previous results from other authors in that there is a break in
the correlation, which reveals the presence of massive galaxies with lower SFR
values (i.e., decreasing star formation). We also note an anticorrelation for
the SSFR with the stellar mass. Again in this case, our data is also consistent
with a break in the correlation, revealing the presence of massive star-forming
galaxies with lower SSFR values, thereby increasing the anticorrelation. These
results might suggest a characteristic mass ($M_{0}$) at which the red sequence
could mostly be assembled. In addition, at a given stellar mass, high-redshift
galaxies have on average higher SFR and SSFR values than local galaxies.
Finally, we explored whether a similar trend could be observed with redshift in
the SSFR$-(u-B)$ color diagram, and we hypothesize that a possible $(u-B)_{0}$
break color may define a characteristic color for the formation of the red
sequence.

the relaxation time for transport in different directions. The transport also
exhibits an interesting directional dependence on the chemical potential and

dispersing direction, the longitudinal and transverse electrical and thermal

the launching angle of the jet; here instead we use the inclination derived
from reflection fits to a sample of AGN. We determine the distorting effect of
unmodeled Fe XXV/XXVI features and, via extensive simulations, determine the
difference in disc inclination resulting from the use of relxill compared to
reflionx. We compare inner disc inclinations to those for the host galaxy
stellar disc derived from the Hubble formula and, via Monte-Carlo simulations,
find a strong lack of a correlation (at >> 5-sigma) implying either widespread
feeding via mergers if we assume the sample to be homogeneous, or that
radiative disc warps are distorting our view of the emission. However, we find
that by removing a small (~1/5) subset of AGN, the remaining sample is
consistent with random sampling of an underlying 1:1 correlation (at the
3-sigma level). A heterogenous sample would likely imply that our view is not
dominated by radiative disc warps but instead by different feeding mechanisms
with the majority consistent with coplanar accretion (although this may be the
result of selection bias), whilst a smaller but not insignificant fraction may
have been fuelled by minor mergers in the recent history of the host galaxy.

what is a unitary transformation, to a dynamical degree of freedom. This theory
was first proposed by Cahill[3], Dell[4], Kim and Zee[5], and Julia and

Lipatov, Altarelli, Parisi (DGLAP) equation, which at threshold contains a
large logarithm that calls into question the convergence of the anomalous
dimension. We demonstrate here that the problematic logarithm is related to
rapidity divergences, and by introducing a rapidity regulator can be tamed. We
show that resumming the rapidity logarithms allows us to reproduce the standard
DGLAP running at threshold as long as a set of potentially large
non-perturbative logarithms are absorbed into the definition of the parton
distribution function (PDF). These terms could, in turn, explain the steep
fall-off of the PDF in the endpoint. We then go on to show that the resummation

media that are triggered by adverse mobility or density ratios, respectively.
These instabilities have been studied extensively in the past for 1)
single-phase flow (e.g., contaminant transport in groundwater,
first-contact-miscible displacement of oil by gas in hydrocarbon production),
and 2) multi-phase immiscible and incompressible flow (e.g.,
water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection in oil reservoirs). Fingering in
multiphase compositional and compressible flow has received much less
attention, perhaps due to its high computational complexity. However, many
important subsurface processes involve multiple phases that exchange species.
Examples are carbon sequestration in saline aquifers and enhanced oil recovery
(EOR) by gas or WAG injection below the minimum miscibility pressure. In
multiphase flow, relative permeabilities affect the mobility contrast for a
given viscosity ratio. Phase behavior can also change local fluid properties,
which can either enhance or mitigate viscous and gravitational instabilities.
This work presents a detailed study of fingering behavior in compositional
multiphase flow in two and three dimensions and considers the effects of 1)
Fickian diffusion, 2) mechanical dispersion, 3) flow rates, 4) domain size and
geometry, 5) formation heterogeneities, 6) gravity, and 7) relative
permeabilities. Results show that fingering in compositional multiphase flow is
profoundly different from miscible conditions and upscaling techniques used for
the latter case are unlikely to be generalizable to the former.

spectral sequence which computes the Picard group of the stable category of

category of $A$-modules can be reconstructed, as an $\infty$-category, as the
totalization of a cosimplicial $\infty$-category whose layers are related to
the stable categories of modules over the quasi-elementary sub-Hopf-algebras of

some cases, is completely understood. This also leads to a spectral sequence
answering a lifting problem in the category of $A$-modules. We then show how to
apply this machinery to compute Picard groups and solve lifting problems in the
case of $\mathcal{A}(1)$-modules, where $\mathcal{A}(1)$ is the subalgebra of
the Steenrod algebra generated by the two first Steenrod squares.

the breakdown of linear response given observations of deterministic dynamical
systems. A goodness-of-fit statistics is developed for a linear statistical
model of the observations, based on results on central limit theorems for
deterministic dynamical systems, and used to detect linear response breakdown.
We apply the method to discrete maps which do not obey linear response and show
that the successful detection of breakdown depends on the length of the time
series, the magnitude of the perturbation and on the choice of the observable.
  We find that in order to reliably reject the assumption of linear response
for typical observables sufficiently large data sets are needed. Even for
simple systems such as the logistic map, one needs of the order of $10^6$
observations to reliably detect the breakdown, if less observations are
available one may be falsely led to conclude that linear response theory is
valid. The amount of data required is larger the smaller the applied
perturbation. For judiciously chosen observables the necessary amount of data
can be drastically reduced, but requires detailed {\em{a priori}} knowledge
about the invariant measure which is typically not available for complex
dynamical systems.
  Furthermore we explore the use of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT)
in cases with limited data length or coarse-graining of observations. The FDT,
if applied naively to a system without linear response, is shown to be very
sensitive to the details of the sampling method, resulting in erroneous
predictions of the response.

synchrotrons by using special anti-symmetric sextupole fields, which can be
produced by a special magnet structure. The method has the potential in
applications demanding for very stable slow extraction from synchrotrons. Our
studies show that the slow extraction at the half-integer resonance by using
anti-symmetric sextupole field has some advantages compared to the normal
sextupole field, and the latter is widely used in the slow extraction method.
One of them is that it can work at a more distant tune from the resonance, so
that it can reduce significantly the intensity variation of the extracted beam
which is mainly caused by the ripples of magnet power supplies. The studies by
both the Hamiltonian theory and numerical simulations show that the stable
region at the proximity of the half-integer resonance by anti-symmetric
sextupole field is much smaller and flatter than the one by standard sextupole
field at the third-order resonance. By gradually increasing the field strength,
the beam can be extracted with intensity more homogeneous than by the usual
third-order resonant method, in the means of both smaller intensity variation
and spike in the beginning spill. Similar to the case with a normal sextupole,
we derive an empirical formula for the area of the stable region with an
anti-symmetric sextupole. One can find that with the same field strength and
the same tune distance to the resonance, the area of stable region or the
change of the area due to the working point variation in the case of
anti-symmetric sextupole is about 1/14 of the one in the case of standard
sextupole. The detailed studies including beam dynamic behaviors at the
proximity of other resonances, influence of 2-D field error, half-integer
stop-band, and resonant slow extraction by using quadrupole field have also

white Gaussian distributed with known intensity. However, in real noisy images,
the noise models are usually unknown beforehand and can be much more complex.
This paper addresses this problem and proposes a novel blind image denoising
algorithm to recover the clean image from noisy one with the unknown noise
model. To model the empirical noise of an image, our method introduces the
mixture of Gaussian distribution, which is flexible enough to approximate
different continuous distributions. The problem of blind image denoising is
reformulated as a learning problem. The procedure is to first build a two-layer
structural model for noisy patches and consider the clean ones as latent
variable. To control the complexity of the noisy patch model, this work
proposes a novel Bayesian nonparametric prior called ""Dependent Dirichlet
Process Tree"" to build the model. Then, this study derives a variational
inference algorithm to estimate model parameters and recover clean patches. We
apply our method on synthesis and real noisy images with different noise
models. Comparing with previous approaches, ours achieves better performance.
The experimental results indicate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm to
cope with practical image denoising tasks.

variational message passing (VMP) are applied to derive two fully distributed

nonlinearity in the observation function, it is intractable to compute the
messages in closed form and most existing solutions rely on Monte Carlo
methods, e.g., particle filtering. We linearize a specific nonlinear term in
the expressions of messages, which enables us to use a Gaussian representation
for all messages. Accordingly, only the mean and variance have to be updated
and transmitted between neighboring nodes, which significantly reduces the
communication overhead and computational complexity. A message passing schedule
scheme is proposed to trade off between estimation performance and
communication overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms
perform very close to particle-based methods with much lower complexity

  In this paper, we firstly prove that each sphere bundle $S_r(\xi)$ of radius
$r>0$ is an isoparametric hypersurface in the total space of $\xi$ equipped
with a connection metric, and for $r>0$ small enough, the induced metric of
$S_r(\xi)$ has positive Ricci curvature under the additional assumptions that
$M$ has a metric with positive Ricci curvature and $n\geq3$.
  As an application, if $M$ admits a metric with positive Ricci curvature and
$n\geq2$, then we construct a metric with positive Ricci curvature on $D(\xi,

isoparametric foliation.
  For a compact minimal isoparametric hypersurface $Y^{n}$ in $S^{n+1}(1)$,
which separates $S^{n+1}(1)$ into $S^{n+1}_+$ and $S^{n+1}_-$, one can get
double manifolds $D(S^{n+1}_+)$ and $D(S^{n+1}_-)$. Inspired by Tang, Xie and

The variation in ring radius of such vortices require Fourier lenses of

novel experimental scheme to generate perfect vortex of any ring radius using a
convex lens and an axicon. As a proof of principle, using a lens of focal
length f=200mm, we have varied the radius of the vortex beam across 0.3-1.18mm

simple scheme to measure the apex angle of an axicon with ease. Using such

thermal [3-7]. For such reservoirs, temperature is a well-defined state
variable and stochastic thermodynamics provides a precise framework for
quantifying engine performance [8-9]. It remains unclear whether these concepts
readily carry over to situations where the reservoirs are out-of-equilibrium
[10], a scenario of particular importance to the functioning of synthetic
[11-12] and biological [13] micro engines and motors. Here we experimentally
realized a micrometer-sized active Stirling engine by periodically cycling a
colloidal particle in a time-varying harmonic optical potential across
bacterial baths at different activities. Unlike in equilibrium thermal
reservoirs, the displacement statistics of the trapped particle becomes
increasingly non-Gaussian with activity. We show that as much as $\approx$ 85\%
of the total power output and $\approx$ 50\% of the overall efficiency stems
from large non-Gaussian particle displacements alone. Most remarkably, at the
highest activities investigated, the efficiency of our quasi-static active heat
engines surpasses the equilibrium saturation limit of Stirling efficiency - the
maximum efficiency of a Stirling engine with the ratio of cold and hot
reservoir temperatures ${T_C\over T_H} \to 0$. Crucially, the failure of
effective temperature descriptions [14-16] for active reservoirs highlights the
dire need for theories that can better capture the physics of micro motors and

gluons are non-perturbatively massive. In the matter sector, the modeled gluon
propagator which can produce a veracious description of meson properties needs
to possess a mass scale, accordingly. Solving the well-known longitudinal
Ward-Green-Takahashi identities (WGTIs) and the less-known transverse
counterparts together, one obtains a nontrivial solution which can shed light
on the structure of the quark-gluon vertex. It is highlighted that the
phenomenologically proposed anomalous chromomagnetic moment (ACM) vertex
originates from the QCD Lagrangian symmetries and its strength is proportional
to the magnitude of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB). The
color-singlet vector and axial-vector WGTIs can relate the BS kernel and the
dressed quark-gluon vertex to each other. Using the relation, one can truncate
the gap equation and the BS equation, systematically, without violating crucial
symmetries, e.g., gauge symmetry and chiral symmetry.

performance model of FDPS (Framework for developing particle simulators). FDPS
is an application-development framework which helps the researchers to develop
particle-based simulation programs for large-scale distributed-memory parallel
supercomputers. A particle-based simulation program for distributed-memory
parallel computers needs to perform domain decomposition, redistribution of
particles, and gathering of particle information for interaction calculation.
Also, even if distributed-memory parallel computers are not used, in order to
reduce the amount of computation, algorithms such as Barnes-Hut tree method
should be used for long-range interactions. For short-range interactions, some
methods to limit the calculation to neighbor particles are necessary. FDPS
provides all of these necessary functions for efficient parallel execution of
particle-based simulations as ""templates"", which are independent of the actual
data structure of particles and the functional form of the interaction. By
using FDPS, researchers can write their programs with the amount of work
necessary to write a simple, sequential and unoptimized program of O(N^2)
calculation cost, and yet the program, once compiled with FDPS, will run
efficiently on large-scale parallel supercomputers. A simple gravitational
N-body program can be written in around 120 lines. We report the actual
performance of these programs and the performance model. The weak scaling
performance is very good, and almost linear speedup was obtained for up to the
full system of K computer. The minimum calculation time per timestep is in the
range of 30 ms (N=10^7) to 300 ms (N=10^9). These are currently limited by the
time for the calculation of the domain decomposition and communication
necessary for the interaction calculation. We discuss how we can overcome these
bottlenecks.

demonstrate that when the interactions occur, each multi-peak soliton exhibits

obtained in the frame of the present work are: (i) a qualitative description of
the specific heat in the limit of low-temperatures for systems with nano-metric
dimensions; (ii) the observation that the corresponding chemical potential
function for finite solids becomes null at finite temperatures as observed in
the Bose-Einstein condensation and; (iii) emergence of a first-order like phase
transition driven by varying $N$.

$N$ species and $M$ elementrary reactions in a rapidly stirred vessel of size
$V$ as a Markov process, we show that a macroscopic chemical thermodynamics
emerges as $V\rightarrow\infty$. The theory is applicable to linear and
nonlinear reactions, closed systems reaching chemical equilibrium, or open,
driven systems approaching to nonequilibrium steady states. A generalized
mesoscopic free energy gives rise to a macroscopic chemical energy function
$\varphi^{ss}(\vx)$ where $\vx=(x_1,\cdots,x_N)$ are the concentrations of the
$N$ chemical species. The macroscopic chemical dynamics $\vx(t)$ satisfies two
emergent laws: (1) $(\rd/\rd t)\varphi^{ss}[\vx(t)]\le 0$, and (2)$(\rd/\rd
t)\varphi^{ss}[\vx(t)]=\text{cmf}(\vx)-\sigma(\vx)$ where entropy production
rate $\sigma\ge 0$ represents the sink for the chemical energy, and chemical
motive force $\text{cmf}\ge 0$ is non-zero if the system is driven under a
sustained nonequilibrium chemostat. For systems with detailed balance
$\text{cmf}=0$, and if one assumes the law of mass action,$\varphi^{ss}(\vx)$
is precisely the Gibbs' function $\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\big[\mu_i^o+\ln x_i\big]$
for ideal solutions. For a class of kinetic systems called complex balanced,
which include many nonlinear systems as well as many simple open, driven
chemical systems, the $\varphi^{ss}(\vx)$, with global minimum at $\vx^*$, has
the generic form $\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\big[\ln(x_i/x_i^*)-x_i+x_i^*\big]$,which has
been known in chemical kinetic literature.Macroscopic emergent ""laws"" are
independent of the details of the underlying kinetics. This theory provides a
concrete example from chemistry showing how a dynamic macroscopic law can
emerge from the kinetics at a level below.

an effective collective charge depending linearly on the deformation parameter.
Where experimental data is available, the contribution of the single particle

describing the $\alpha$- nucleus interaction contains two terms, a spherically
symmetric potential given by the double-folding of the M3Y nucleon-nucleon

quadrupole-quadrupole (QQ) interaction. The $\alpha$-decaying state is
identified as a narrow outgoing resonance in this potential. The intensity of
the transition to the first excited state is reproduced by the QQ coupling
strength. It depends linearly both on the nuclear deformation and the square of
the reduced width for the decay to the bandhead, respectively. Predicted
intensities for transitions to higher excited states are in a reasonable

either use a superior cooperative strategy whose payoff depends on the other
players' choices or use an inferior strategy whose payoff is independent of
what other players do; the cooperative strategy may incur a loss if
sufficiently many other players do not cooperate. Stag hunts have two (strict)
pure Nash equilibria, namely, universal cooperation and universal defection (as
well as a mixed equilibrium of low predictive value). Selection of the inferior

Heterogeneous Cellular Networks (HCNs). Uplink Fractional Power Control (FPC)
is a well known method that aims to cope with such limiting factor as well as
to save battery live. In order to do that, the path losses associated with
Mobile Terminal (MT) transmissions are partially compensated so that a lower
interference is leaked towards neighboring cells. Classical FPC techniques only
consider a set of parameters that depends on the own MT transmission, like
desired received power at the Base Station (BS) or the path loss between the MT
and its serving BS, among others. Contrary to classical FPC, in this paper we
use stochastic geometry to analyze a power control mechanism that keeps the
interference generated by each MT under a given threshold. We also consider a
maximum transmitted power and a partial compensation of the path loss.
Interestingly, our analysis reveals that such Interference Aware (IA) method
can reduce the average power consumption and increase the average spectral
efficiency. Additionally, the variance of the interference is reduced, thus
improving the performance of Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) since the
interference can be better estimated at the MT.

and [CI] emission from the same region, we modeled the three OH transitions,
1612, 1665, 1667 MHz successfully through escape probability non-LTE radiative
transfer model calculations. We could not reproduce the 1720 MHz observations,
due to un-modeled pumping mechanisms, of which the most likely candidate is a
C-shock. The abundance of OH and CO-dark molecular gas (DMG) are well
constrained. The OH abundance [OH]/[H2] decreases from 8*10-7 to 1*10-7 as Av
increases from 0.4 to 2.7 mag, following an empirical law [OH]/[H2]= 1.5 *
10^{-7} + 9.0 * 10^{-7} * exp(-Av/0.81), which is higher than PDR model
predictions for low extinction regions by a factor of 80. The overabundance of
OH at extinctions at or below 1 mag is likely the result of a C-shock. The dark
gas fraction (DGF, defined as fraction of molecular gas without detectable CO
emission) decreases from 80% to 20%, following a gaussian profile DGF= 0.90 *
exp(-( Av -0.79 )/0.71)^2) This trend of the DGF is consistent with our
understanding that the DGF drops at low visual extinction due to
photodissociation of H2 and drops at high visual extinction due to CO
formation. The DGF peaks in the extinction range where H2 has already formed
and achieved self-shielding but 12CO has not. Two narrow velocity components
with a peak-to-peak spacing of ~ 1 km s-1 were clearly identified. Their
relative intensity and variation in space and frequency suggest colliding

numerically. The general formalism is then applied to the classical
$\beta$-Gaussian (${\cal I}=[-L,L]$), $\beta$-Wishart (${\cal I}=[1,L]$) and
$\beta$-Cauchy (${\cal I}=[-L,L]$) ensembles. Expanding the rate function
around its minimum, we find that generically the number variance ${\rm

of the interval, with a maximum that can be precisely characterized. These
analytical results, corroborated by numerical simulations, provide the full

injected at the jet nozzle. The stationary features can be interpreted as
recollimation shocks in non-pressure matched jets if they show a
quasi-symmetric bump in the spectral index distribution. In some jets there may
be interactions between the two kinds of shocks. These shock--shock
interactions are observable with VLBI techniques, and their signature should
also be imprinted on the single--dish light curves. We performed relativistic
hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of over-pressured and pressure-matched jets. To
simulate the shock interaction we injected a perturbation at the jet nozzle
once a steady-state was reached. We computed the non-thermal emission
(including adiabatic and synchotron losses) resulting from the simulation. We
show that the injection of perturbations in a jet can produce a bump in
emission at GHz frequencies previous to the main flare, which is produced when
the perturbation fills the jet in the observer's frame. The detailed analysis
of our simulations and the non-thermal emission calculations show that
interaction between a recollimation shock and traveling shock produce a typical
and clear signature in both the single--dish light curves and in the VLBI
observations: the flaring peaks are higher and delayed with respect to the
evolution of a perturbation through a conical jet. This fact can allow to
detect such interactions for stationary components lying outside of the region
in where the losses are dominated by inverse Compton scattering.

in the definition of duals of spinors and the associated field adjoints. In the
process, for the first time, we provide a quantum theory of spin one-half
fermions that is free from all the mentioned issues. The interactions of the
new fermions are restricted to dimension-four quartic self interaction, and
also to a dimension-four coupling with the Higgs. A generalised Yukawa coupling
of the new fermions with neutrinos provides an hitherto unsuspected source of
lepton-number violation. The new fermions thus present a first-principle dark
matter partner to Dirac fermions of the standard model of high energy physics
with contrasting mass dimensions -- that of three halves for the latter versus
one of the former without mutating the statistics from fermionic to bosonic.

questioned by applied research and empirical tests resulted in inconclusive
results. The ability to identify blue text in foveal and parafoveal vision was
identified as potentially constrained by the low number of foveally centered
blue light sensitive retinal cells. The present study investigates if foveal
and parafoveal perceptibility of hypertext is reduced during reading. A
silent-sentence reading study with simultaneous eye movement recordings and the
invisible boundary paradigm, which allows the investigation of foveal and
parafoveal perceptibility, separately, was realized. Target words in sentences
were presented in either black or blue and either underlined or normal. No
effect of color and underlining, but a preview benefit could be detected for
first pass reading measures (comparing fixation times after degraded vs. un-
degraded parafoveal previews). Fixation time measures that included re-reading
(i.e., total viewing times) showed, in addition to a preview effect, a reduced
fixation time for not highlighted (black not underlined) in contrast to
highlighted target words (either blue or underlined or both). Thus, the present
pattern reflects no detectable perceptual disadvantage of hyperlink stimuli but
increased attraction of attention resources, after first pass reading, through
highlighting. Blue or underlined text allows readers to easily perceive
hypertext and at the same time readers re-visited hypertext longer as a
consequence of highlighting. On the basis of the present evidence blue
hypertext can be safely recommended to web designers for future use.

Given a model of a system, e.g., a Kripke structure, and a formula specifying
its expected behaviour, one can verify whether the system meets the behaviour
by checking the formula against the model.
  Classically, system behaviour is expressed by a formula of a temporal logic,
such as LTL and the like. These logics are ""point-wise"" interpreted, as they
describe how the system evolves state-by-state. However, there are relevant
properties, such as those constraining the temporal relations between pairs of
temporally extended events or involving temporal aggregations, which are
inherently ""interval-based"", and thus asking for an interval temporal logic.
  In this paper, we give a formalization of the model checking problem in an
interval logic setting. First, we provide an interpretation of formulas of
Halpern and Shoham's interval temporal logic HS over finite Kripke structures,
which allows one to check interval properties of computations. Then, we prove
that the model checking problem for HS against finite Kripke structures is
decidable by a suitable small model theorem, and we provide a lower bound to
its computational complexity.

where the morphology supported the scenario of a rotating and expanding disk or
a bipolar outflow. Comparing the interferometric and single-dish spectra we
found that, typically, 50-70 per cent of the flux was missing. This phenomena
is not strongly related to the distance of the source. The EVN imaging reveals
that in the complete sample of 63 sources the ring-like morphology appeared in
17 per cent of sources, arcs were seen in a further 8 per cent, and the
structures were complex in 46 per cent cases. The UC HII regions coincide in
position in the sky for 13 per cent of the sources. They are related both to
extremely high and low luminosity masers from the sample.

a radius of 2.41 +/- 0.06 solar radii plus a Roche-lobe filling secondary star

Its

Here, the literature is unified and extended by identifying seventeen physical

applications are discussed in stochastic processes (first passage in two

parallel plates and unbounded equilateral wedges (with the third side hidden

This leads to the question of whether the scarcity of crossings in languages
arises from an independent and specific constraint on crossings. We provide
statistical evidence suggesting that this is not the case, as the proportion of
dependency crossings of sentences from a wide range of languages can be
accurately estimated by a simple predictor based on a null hypothesis on the
local probability that two dependencies cross given their lengths. The relative
error of this predictor never exceeds 5% on average, whereas the error of a
baseline predictor assuming a random ordering of the words of a sentence is at

principle of dependency length minimization.

cascade lasers (QCLs) and laser diodes (LDs) is presented. Previously, low
threshold Risken-Nummedal-Graham-Haken (RNGH) instabilities were reported in
several experimental studies of QCLs. They were attributed so far to the
combined effect of the induced grating of carrier population and of a built-in
saturable absorption feature that may be present in the monolithic
single-section cavity of these Fabry-P\'erot lasers. Here we show that
low-threshold RNGH instabilities in QCLs occur due to a carrier coherence
grating induced in the gain medium and not due to intracavity saturable
absorption. We find that QCLs with a few mm long cavity exhibit intermittent
RNGH self-pulsations while regular self-pulsations are possible in short-cavity
QCLs, with the cavity length of 100 um or smaller. We examine a transient
behavior to RNGH self-pulsations in short-cavity QCLs and find features that
resemble cooperative superradiance. Our findings open a practical way of
achieving ultra-short pulse production regimes in the mid-infrared spectral
range. Applying same approach to semiconductor laser diodes (LDs) we explain
the absence of RNGH self-pulsation in LDs based on a quantum well gain media,
while practically established method for reaching the ultrafast coherent
emission regimes in LDs is to incorporate a separately contacted saturable
absorber section in the LD cavity.

frequency-dependence of TLS energy relaxation rates that can be explained by a
coupling to phononic modes rather than by anticipated mutual TLS interactions.
Most investigated TLSs are found to be free of pure dephasing at their energy
degeneracy points, around which their Ramsey and spin-echo dephasing rates
scale linearly and quadratically with asymmetry energy, respectively. We
provide an explanation based on the standard tunneling model, and identify

value being driven by the stellar X-ray flux. In contrast, densities of
longer-lived H$^+$ show very little day/night variability and the magnitude is
driven by the level of stellar EUV flux. The H$_3^+$ peak in EGPs with upper
atmospheres where H$_2$ is dissociated under strong stellar illumination is
pushed to altitudes below the homopause, where this ion is likely to be
destroyed through reactions with heavy species. The inclusion of secondary
ionisation processes produces significantly enhanced ion and electron densities
at altitudes below the main EUV ionisation peak, as compared to models that do
not include electron-impact ionisation. We estimate infrared emissions from
H$_3^+$, and while, in an H/H$_2$/He atmosphere, these are larger from planets
orbiting close to more active stars, they still appear too low to be detected
with current observatories.

of time slots (or rounds) such that each message is received in the very same
round in which it is sent. ""Broadcast/receive"" means that during a round a
process can either broadcast a message to its neighbors or receive a message
from one of them. In such a communication model, no two neighbors of the same
process, nor a process and any of its neighbors, must be allowed to broadcast
during the same time slot (thereby preventing message collisions in the first
case, and message conflicts in the second case). From a graph theory point of
view, the allocation of slots to processes is know as the distance-2 coloring
problem: a color must be associated with each process (defining the time slots
in which it will be allowed to broadcast) in such a way that any two processes
at distance at most 2 obtain different colors, while the total number of colors
is ""as small as possible"". The paper presents a parallel message-passing
distance-2 coloring algorithm suited to trees, whose roots are dynamically
defined. This algorithm, which is itself collision-free and conflict-free, uses
$\Delta + 1$ colors where $\Delta$ is the maximal degree of the graph (hence
the algorithm is color-optimal). It does not require all processes to have
different initial identities, and its time complexity is $O(d \Delta)$, where d
is the depth of the tree. As far as we know, this is the first distributed
distance-2 coloring algorithm designed for the broadcast/receive round-based
communication model, which owns all the previous properties.

  Decompositions","A short version of this paper will appear in SIGMOD 2016",,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a set D of tuples defined on a domain Omega, we study differentially
private algorithms for constructing a histogram over Omega to approximate the
tuple distribution in D. Existing solutions for the problem mostly adopt a
hierarchical decomposition approach, which recursively splits Omega into
sub-domains and computes a noisy tuple count for each sub-domain, until all
noisy counts are below a certain threshold. This approach, however, requires
that we (i) impose a limit h on the recursion depth in the splitting of Omega
and (ii) set the noise in each count to be proportional to h. This leads to
inferior data utility due to the following dilemma: if we use a small h, then
the resulting histogram would be too coarse-grained to provide an accurate
approximation of data distribution; meanwhile, a large h would yield a
fine-grained histogram, but its quality would be severely degraded by the
increased amount of noise in the tuple counts.
  To remedy the deficiency of existing solutions, we present PrivTree, a
histogram construction algorithm that also applies hierarchical decomposition
but features a crucial (and somewhat surprising) improvement: when deciding
whether or not to split a sub-domain, the amount of noise required in the
corresponding tuple count is independent of the recursive depth. This enables
PrivTree to adaptively generate high-quality histograms without even asking for
a pre-defined threshold on the depth of sub-domain splitting. As concrete
examples, we demonstrate an application of PrivTree in modelling spatial data,
and show that it can also be extended to handle sequence data (where the
decision in sub-domain splitting is not based on tuple counts but a more
sophisticated measure). Our experiments on a variety of real datasets show that
PrivTree significantly outperforms the states of the art in terms of data
utility.

equations. This equation was originally introduced to model phase separation in
binary alloys, where phase stands for concentration of different components in
alloy. When the binary alloy under preparation is subjected to a rapid
reduction in temperature below a critical temperature, it has been
experimentally observed that the concentration changes from a mixed state to a
visibly distinct spatially separated two phase for binary alloy. This rapid
reduction in the temperature, the so-called ""deep quench limit"", is modeled
effectively by obstacle potential. The discretization of Cahn-Hilliard equation
with obstacle potential leads to a block $2 \times 2$ {\em non-linear} system,
where the $(1,1)$ block has a non-linear and non-smooth term. Recently a
globally convergent Newton Schur method was proposed for the non-linear Schur
complement corresponding to this non-linear system. The proposed method is
similar to an inexact active set method in the sense that the active sets are
first approximately identified by solving a quadratic obstacle problem
corresponding to the $(1,1)$ block of the block $2 \times 2$ system, and later
solving a reduced linear system by annihilating the rows and columns
corresponding to identified active sets. For solving the quadratic obstacle
problem, various optimal multigrid like methods have been proposed. In this
paper, we study a non-standard norm that is equivalent to applying a block
diagonal preconditioner to the reduced linear systems. Numerical experiments
confirm the optimality of the solver and convergence independent of problem
parameters on sufficiently fine mesh.

resting-state networks. Our results show that functional integrations between
two resting-state networks predominately occurs in bursts of activity with
intermittent periods of less connectivity, whereas the functional connectivity
within resting-state networks is characterized by a tonic/periodic connectivity
pattern. Moreover, the point-based approach allowed us to estimate the
persistency of brain connectivity, i.e. the duration of the intrinsic trace or
memory of resting-state connectivity patterns. The described point-based method
of dynamic resting-state functional connectivity allows for a detailed and
expanded view on the temporal dynamics of resting-state connectivity that
provides novel insights into how neuronal information processing is integrated
in the human brain at the level of large-scale networks.

under which condition the coherence can be frozen in a relativistic setting. We
find that the frozen condition is either (i) the initial state is prepared as a

irreversible under the influence of thermal noise induced by Unruh radiation.
It is shown that quantum coherence approaches zero only in the limit of an
infinite acceleration, while quantum entanglement could reduce to zero for a
finite acceleration. It is also demonstrated that the robustness of quantum
coherence is better than entanglement under the influence of the atom-field
interaction for an extremely large acceleration. Therefore, quantum coherence
is more robust than entanglement in an accelerating system and the coherence

the maximal dimension of a subspace $V\subset \mathfrak g$ that is contained in
the closure of $\mathcal O$. In this note, we prove that $d_\mathcal O \le
\frac{1}{2}\dim\mathcal O$ and this upper bound is attained if and only if
$\mathcal O$ is a Richardson orbit. Furthermore, if $V$ is $B$-stable and $\dim
V= \frac{1}{2}\dim\mathcal O$, then $V$ is the nilradical of a polarisation of
$\mathcal O$. Every nilpotent orbit closure has a distinguished $B$-stable
subspace constructed via an $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-triple, which is called the
Dynkin ideal. We then characterise the nilpotent orbits $\mathcal O$ such that
the Dynkin ideal (1) has the minimal dimension among all $B$-stable subspaces
$\mathfrak c$ such that $\mathfrak c\cap\mathcal O$ is dense in $\mathfrak c$,
or (2) is the only $B$-stable subspace $\mathfrak c$ such that $\mathfrak
c\cap\mathcal O$ is dense in $\mathfrak c$.

medium can be described by the so-called Brinkman equation coupled with a
convective Cahn-Hilliard (CH) equation. The former governs the average fluid
velocity $\mathbf{u}$, while the latter rules evolution of $\varphi$, the
difference of the (relative) concentrations of the two phases. The two
equations are known as the Cahn-Hilliard-Brinkman (CHB) system. In particular,
the Brinkman equation is a Stokes-like equation with a forcing term (Korteweg
force) which is proportional to $\mu\nabla\varphi$, where $\mu$ is the chemical
potential. When the viscosity vanishes, then the system becomes the
Cahn-Hilliard-Hele-Shaw (CHHS) system. Both systems have been studied from the
theoretical and the numerical viewpoints. However, theoretical results on the
CHHS system are still rather incomplete. For instance, uniqueness of weak
solutions is unknown even in 2D. Here we replace the usual CH equation with its
physically more relevant nonlocal version. This choice allows us to prove more
about the corresponding nonlocal CHHS system. More precisely, we first study
well-posedness for the CHB system, endowed with no-slip and no-flux boundary
conditions. Then, existence of a weak solution to the CHHS system is obtained
as a limit of solutions to the CHB system. Stronger assumptions on the initial
datum allow us to prove uniqueness for the CHHS system. Further regularity
properties are obtained by assuming additional, though reasonable, assumptions
on the interaction kernel. By exploiting these properties, we provide an
estimate for the difference between the solution to the CHB system and the one
to the CHHS system with respect to viscosity.

Most of these techniques rely on tuning parameters that are often determined by
cross-validation (CV) based methods, which raises important stability issues.
To overcome this, we have developed a new dynamic bootstrapbased method for
significant predictor selection, suitable for both PLS regression and its
incorporation into generalized linear models (GPLS). It relies on the
establishment of bootstrap confidence intervals, that allows testing of the
significance of predictors at preset type I risk $\alpha$, and avoids the use
of CV. We have also developed adapted versions of sparse PLS (SPLS) and sparse
GPLS regression (SGPLS), using a recently introduced non-parametric
bootstrap-based technique for the determination of the numbers of components.
We compare their variable selection reliability and stability concerning tuning
parameters determination, as well as their predictive ability, using simulated
data for PLS and real microarray gene expression data for PLS-logistic
classification. We observe that our new dynamic bootstrapbased method has the
property of best separating random noise in y from the relevant information
with respect to other methods, leading to better accuracy and predictive
abilities, especially for non-negligible noise levels.

multi-agent systems is considered under switching topologies where each agent
is subject to some local (unbounded) disturbances. While these unknown
disturbances may disrupt the performance of agents, a disturbance observer
based approach is employed to estimate and reject them. Varying communication
topologies are also taken into consideration, and their byproduct difficulties
are overcome by using common Lyapunov function techniques. According to the
available information in difference cases, two disturbance observer based
protocols are proposed to solve this problem. Their effectiveness is verified
by simulations.

on the hard X-ray delay. We divided the entire data set into several series,
each corresponding to a satellite orbit, and performed the Fourier and wavelet
analysis and the limit cycle mapping technique using the count rate and the
average energy as independent variables. We found that the count rates
correlate with the recurrence time of bursts and with hard X-ray delay,
confirming the results previously obtained. In this observation, however, the
recurrence times are distributed along two parallel branches with a constant
difference of 5.2+/-0.5 s.

established.

different coupling channels between the resonator and supporting stem are
orthogonal to each other. Such mechanism is proved to be universal for
different geometries and materials, thus can also be generalized to design the
