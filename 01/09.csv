protoplanetary discs that examine the formation and evolution of vortices by
the vertical shear instability (VSI). In agreement with recent work, we find
that discs with radially decreasing temperature profiles and short thermal
relaxation time-scales, are subject to the axisymmetric VSI. In three
dimensions, the resulting velocity perturbations give rise to
quasi-axisymmetric potential vorticity perturbations that break-up into
discrete vortices, in a manner that is reminiscent of the Rossby wave
instability. Discs with very short thermal evolution time-scales (i.e.
{\tau}<0.1 local orbit periods) develop strong vorticity perturbations that
roll up into vortices that have small aspect ratios ({\chi}<2) and short
lifetimes (~ a few orbits). Longer thermal time-scales give rise to vortices
with larger aspect ratios (6<{\chi}<10), and lifetimes that depend on the
entropy gradient. A steeply decreasing entropy profile leads to vortex
lifetimes that exceed the simulation run times of hundreds of orbital periods.
Vortex lifetimes in discs with positive or weakly decreasing entropy profiles
are much shorter, being 10s of orbits at most, suggesting that the subcritical
baroclinic instability plays an important role in sustaining vortices against
destruction through the elliptical instability. Applied to the outer regions of
protoplanetary discs, where the VSI is most likely to occur, our results
suggest that vortices formed by the VSI are likely to be short lived
structures.

Further understanding of the CTC flow regime, as well as the threshold
passing-through pressure is key to the design of deformation based CTC
filtration devices. In the present numerical study, we investigate the
transitional deformation and pressure signature from surface tension dominated
flow to viscous shear stress dominated flow using a droplet model. Regarding
whether CTC fully blocks the channel inlet, we observe two flow regimes: CTC
squeezing and shearing regime. By studying the relation of CTC deformation at
the exact critical pressure point for increasing inlet velocity, three
different types of cell deformation are observed: 1) hemispherical front, 2)
parabolic front, and 3) elongated CTC co-flowing with carrier media. Focusing
on the circular channel, we observe a first increasing and then decreasing
critical pressure change with increasing flow rate. By pressure analysis, the
concept of optimum velocity is proposed to explain the behavior of CTC
filtration and design optimization of CTC filter. Similar behavior is also
observed in channels with symmetrical cross sessions like square and triangular
but not in rectangular channels which only results in decreasing critical
pressure.

large multi-wavelength effort by many observers with the aim of following up
the transient flaring event of V404 Cygni that took place for several weeks in
2015 June. Aims. Our main original aim was to contribute to the study of this
transient source by acquiring broad-band photometric observations during its
most active flaring phases. Nevertheless, after a detailed analysis of the
data, several interesting results were obtained that encouraged a dedicated
publication. Methods. The methodology used was based on broad-band differential
CCD photometry. This outburst of V404 Cygni rendered the source a very bright
target easily within reach of small educational telescopes. Therefore, the 41
cm telescope available at the Astronomical Observatory of the University of
Ja\'en was used in this work. Results. We detected variability at different
time scales, both in amplitude and colour. Individual optical flares appear
every half hour on average during our 3 h long observation, although
large-amplitude (\sim 1 mag) variations are also observed to occur on intervals
as short as 10 minutes. Also, colour variations appear to be highly correlated
in a colour-colour diagram. Another remarkable finding is the detection of time
lag, from about one to a fraction of a minute between light curves in different
filters (VRcIc). Conclusions. The observed behaviour is tentatively interpreted
in an scenario based on the ejection of non-thermal emitting, relativistic
plasmons, with their synchrotron spectra extending up to optical wavelengths.
This would render some of the V404 Cygni flares very similar to those of the
well-know microquasar GRS 1915+105

is often encountered in machine learning. A common requirement in this setting
is to approximate posterior probabilities of positive and negative classes for
a previously unseen data point. This problem can be decomposed into two steps:
(i) the development of accurate predictors that discriminate between positive
and unlabeled data, and (ii) the accurate estimation of the prior probabilities
of positive and negative examples. In this work we primarily focus on the
latter subproblem. We study nonparametric class prior estimation and formulate
this problem as an estimation of mixing proportions in two-component mixture
models, given a sample from one of the components and another sample from the
mixture itself. We show that estimation of mixing proportions is generally
ill-defined and propose a canonical form to obtain identifiability while
maintaining the flexibility to model any distribution. We use insights from
this theory to elucidate the optimization surface of the class priors and
propose an algorithm for estimating them. To address the problems of
high-dimensional density estimation, we provide practical transformations to
low-dimensional spaces that preserve class priors. Finally, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our method on univariate and multivariate data.

generalized estimating equations are used to estimate the marginal means. To
address the issue of parameter dependence a Bayesian approach is employed.
Prior distributions are assumed on the model parameters which are then
incorporated into the D-optimal design criterion by integrating it over the
prior distribution. Three case studies, one with binary outcomes in a
4$\times$4 crossover trial, second one based on count data for a 2$\times$2

particular, we show that graphs with tree-breadth one are in some sense the

luminosity is generally not uncommon. This suggests that the molecular gas is
shielded from the radiation or is physically remote from the source of the
continuum emission, as it appears to be from CO observations of high redshift
radio galaxies.

class has recently found applications in problems such as compressive imaging,
multi-sensor acquisition systems and sparse regularization in inverse problems.
In this paper we present uniform recovery guarantees for this class when the
measurement matrix corresponds to a subsampled isometry. We do this by
establishing a variant of the standard restricted isometry property for sparse
in levels vectors, known as the restricted isometry property in levels.
Interestingly, besides the usual log factors, our uniform recovery guarantees
are simpler and less stringent than existing nonuniform recovery guarantees.
For the particular case of discrete Fourier sampling with Haar wavelet
sparsity, a corollary of our main theorem yields a new recovery guarantee which
improves over the current state-of-the-art.

measurements on the hole doped disordered cobaltite
La$_{0.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$CoO$_3$. Our results show that the magnetically ordered
state of the system consists of coexisting non-ferromagnetic phases along with
percolating ferromagnetic-clusters. The percolating ferromagnetic-clusters
possibly start a magnetic ordering at the Curie temperature of 201.5(5)~K. The
non-ferromagnetic phases mainly consist of antiferromagnetic-clusters with size
smaller than the ferromagnetic-clusters. Below Curie temperature the system
exhibits an irreversibility in the field cooled and zero field cooled
magnetization and frequency dependence in the peak of ac susceptibility. These
dynamical features indicate towards the possible coexistence of spin-glass
phase along with ferromagnetic-clusters similar to La$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$CoO$_3$
(x$\geq$0.18), but the absence of field divergence in third harmonic of ac
susceptibility and zero field cooled memory clearly rule out any such
possibility. We argue that the spin-glass phase in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$CoO$_3$
(x$\geq$0.18) is associated with the presence of incommensurate
antiferromagnetic ordering in non-ferromagnetic phases which is absent in
La$_{0.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$CoO$_3$. Our analysis show that the observed dynamical
features in La$_{0.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$CoO$_3$ are possibly due to progressive thermal
blocking of ferromagnetic-clusters which is further confirmed by the
Wohlfarth's model of superparamagnetism. The frequency dependence of the peak
of ac susceptibility obeys the Vogel-Fulcher law with $\tau_0\approx10^{-9}$s.
This together with the existence of an AT line in H-T space indicates the
presence of significant inter-cluster interaction among these
ferromagnetic-clusters.

$v_3^2\{2\}=\langle \cos3(\phi_1-\phi_2)\rangle$, where $\phi_1-\phi_2$ is the
angular difference in azimuth, is studied as a function of the pseudorapidity
difference between particle pairs $\Delta\eta = \eta_1-\eta_2$. Non-zero
{\vthree} is directly related to the previously observed large-$\Delta\eta$
narrow-$\Delta\phi$ ridge correlations and has been shown in models to be
sensitive to the existence of a low viscosity Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) phase.
For sufficiently central collisions, $v_3^2\{2\}$ persist down to an energy of
7.7 GeV suggesting that QGP may be created even in these low energy collisions.
In peripheral collisions at these low energies however, $v_3^2\{2\}$ is
consistent with zero. When scaled by pseudorapidity density of charged particle
multiplicity per participating nucleon pair, $v_3^2\{2\}$ for central
collisions shows a minimum near {\snn}$=20$ GeV.

perform a number of simulations of shapes and shifts of $H_{\beta}$ lines
emitted from SMBBHs, taking into account the emission from two different
regions located around both black holes, and kinematical effects which should
be present in a SMBBH. In the model we connect the parameters of the lines with
the mass of black holes and find that the peak shift depends, not only on
kinematical effects of system rotation and black hole mass ratio, but it is
also a function of the individual masses of the two black holes (BHs).

field cooled (ZFC) magnetization exhibit a thermomagnetic irreversibility and
the ac susceptibility show a frequency dependent peak at the ferromagnetic
ordering temperature (T$_C$$\approx$203~K) of the clusters. These features
indicate about the presence of a non-equilibrium state below T$_C$. In the
non-equilibrium state, the dynamic scaling of the imaginary part of ac
susceptibility and the static scaling of the nonlinear susceptibility clearly
establish a spin-glass like cooperative freezing of ferromagnetic clusters at
200.9(2)~K. The existence of spin-glass like freezing of ferromagnetic clusters
is further substantiated by the ZFC aging and memory experiments. We also
observe certain dynamical features which are not present in a typical
spin-glass, such as, initial magnetization after ZFC aging first increases and
then decreases with the wait time and an imperfect recovery of relaxation in
negative temperature cycling experiments. This imperfect recovery transforms to
perfect recovery on concurrent field cycling. Our analysis suggests that these
additional dynamical features have their origin in inter-cluster exchange
interaction and cluster size distribution. The inter-cluster exchange
interaction above the magnetic percolation gives a superferromagnetic state in
some granular thin films but our results show the absence of typical
superferromagnetic like state in La$_{0.75}$Ba$_{0.25}$CoO$_3$.

constant-coefficient reaction-diffusion equation on N-balls has been solved by
means of the backstepping method. However, the extension of this result to
spatially-varying coefficients is far from trivial. This work deals with
radially-varying reaction coefficients under revolution symmetry conditions on
a disk (the 2-D case). Under these conditions, the equations become singular in
the radius. When applying the backstepping method, the same type of singularity
appears in the backstepping kernel equations. Traditionally, well-posedness of
the kernel equations is proved by transforming them into integral equations and
then applying the method of successive approximations. In this case, the
resulting integral equation is singular. A successive approximation series can
still be formulated, however its convergence is challenging to show due to the
singularities. The problem is solved by a rather non-standard proof that uses
the properties of the Catalan numbers, a well-known sequence frequently used in
combinatorial mathematics.

of local charges and show that half of the seeming conservation laws are
conserved only if the number of sites is odd. In even chains the set of
noninteracting charges is abelian, like in the periodic case when the number of
sites is odd. In odd chains the set is doubled and becomes non-abelian, like in
even periodic chains. The dependence of the charges on the parity of the
chain's size undermines the common belief that the thermodynamic limit of
diagonal ensembles exists. We consider also the transverse-field Ising chain,
where the situation is more ordinary. The generalization to the XY model in a
transverse field is not straightforward and we propose a general framework to
carry out similar calculations. We conjecture the form of the bulk part of the

provide evidence that in a region of the parameter space there is a reduction
of the number of quasilocal conservation laws invariant under chain inversion.

construct a mass-complete (log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$) $\ge$ 9.75), AGN luminosity
limited sample of 235 AGN hosts over z = 0.2 - 3.2. We compare the rest-frame U
- V versus V - J (UVJ) colours and specific star-formation rates (sSFRs) of the
AGN hosts to a mass-matched control sample of inactive (non-AGN) galaxies. UVJ
diagnostics reveal AGN tend to be hosted in a lower fraction of quiescent
galaxies and a higher fraction of dusty galaxies than the control sample. Using
160{\mu}m Herschel PACS data, we find the mean specific star-formation rate of
AGN hosts to be elevated by 0.34$\pm$0.07 dex with respect to the control
sample across all redshifts. This offset is primarily driven by
infrared-selected AGN, where the mean sSFR is found to be elevated by as much
as a factor of ~5. The remaining population, comprised predominantly of X-ray
AGN hosts, is found mostly consistent with inactive galaxies, exhibiting only a
marginal elevation. We discuss scenarios that may explain these findings and

the formation and evolution of galaxies. As the number of observationally
determined stellar abundances continues to climb, these simulations are able to
provide new constraints on the early star formaton history and chemical
evolution inside both the Milky Way and Local Group dwarf galaxies. Here, we
aim to reproduce the low $\alpha$-element scatter observed in metal-poor stars.
We first demonstrate that as stellar particles inside simulations drop below a
mass threshold, increases in the resolution produce an unacceptably large
scatter as one particle is no longer a good approximation of an entire stellar
population. This threshold occurs at around $10^3\,\rm{M_\odot}$, a mass limit
easily reached in current (and future) simulations. By simulating the Sextans
and Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxies we show that this increase in scatter at
high resolutions arises from stochastic supernovae explosions. In order to
reduce this scatter down to the observed value, we show the necessity of
introducing a metal mixing scheme into particle-based simulations. The impact
of the method used to inject the metals into the surrounding gas is also
discussed. We finally summarise the best approach for accurately reproducing
the scatter in simulations of both Local Group dwarf galaxies and in the Milky
Way.

Taurus L1517 dark cloud which previously could not be explained (Hacar et. al
2011). Core fragmentation is a vital step for the formation of stars.
Observations suggest a connection to the filamentary structure of the cloud gas
but it remains unclear which process is responsible. We show that the
gravitational instability process of an isothermal cylinder can account for the
exhibited fragmentation under the assumption that the perturbation grows on the
dominant wavelength. We use numerical simulations with the code RAMSES,
estimate observed column densities and line-of-sight velocities and compare
them to the observations. A critical factor for the observed fragmentation is
that cores grow by redistributing mass within the filament and thus the density
between the cores decreases over the fragmentation process. This often leads to
wrong dominant wavelength estimates as it is strongly dependent on the initial
central density. We argue that non-linear effects also play an important role
on the evolution of the fragmentation. Once the density perturbation grows
above the critical line-mass, non-linearity leads to an enhancement of the
central core density in comparison to the analytical prediction. Choosing the
correct initial conditions with perturbation strengths of around 20\%, leads to
inclination corrected line-of-sight velocities and central core densities
within the observational measurement error in a realistic evolution time.

luminosity. Dedicated Monte Carlo tests suggest that the substantial
observational uncertainties in the black hole virial masses can effectively
erase any intrinsic dependence of alpha_3000 on black hole mass, in line with
some previous studies. (ii) The mean slope alpha_3000 of radio-loud sources,
thought to be produced by rapidly spinning black holes, is comparable to, or
even redder than, that of radio-quiet quasars. Indeed, although quasars appear
to become more radio loud with decreasing luminosity, we still do not detect
any significant dependence of alpha_3000 on radio loudness. The predicted mean
alpha_3000 slopes tend to be bluer than in the data. Disk models with high
inclinations and dust extinction tend to produce redder slopes closer to
empirical estimates. Our mean alpha_3000 values are close to the ones
independently inferred at z<0.5 suggesting weak evolution with redshift, at
least for moderately luminous quasars.

The wind galaxies also span a wide range in SFR surface densities ($10^{-3}

star clusters show unexpectedly broad main-sequence turnoffs, raising the
possibility that these clusters have experienced more than one episode of star
formation. Such a scenario predicts the existence of an extended main sequence
turn off (eMSTO) only in clusters with escape velocities above a certain
threshold ($>15$ km s$^{-1}$), which would allow them to retain or accrete gas
that eventually would fuel a secondary extended star-formation episode. This
paper presents a test of this scenario based on the study of the young and
massive cluster NGC 7252: W3. We use the HST photometry from WFPC2 and WFC3
images obtained with UV and optical filters, as well as MagE echellette
spectrograph data from the Las Campanas Clay 6.5m telescope, in order to
construct the observed UV/optical SED of NGC 7252: W3. The observations are
then compared with synthetic spectra based on different star formation
histories consistent with those of the eMSTO clusters. We find that the SED of
this cluster is best fitted by a synthetic spectrum with a single stellar
population of age $570^{+70}_{-62}$ Myr and mass $1.13^{+0.14}_{-0.13}\times
10^8$ M$_\odot$, confirming earlier works on NGC 7252: W3. We also estimate the
lower limit on the central escape velocity of 193 km s$^{-1}$. We rule out
extended star-formation histories, like those inferred for the eMSTO clusters
in the Magellanic Clouds, at high confidence. We conclude that the escape
velocity of a cluster does not dictate whether a cluster can undergo extended
periods of star formation.

model potential for BaTiO$_3$ reproduces the temperature-driven phase

By analyzing the local displacements of Ti atoms, we demonstrate that the phase

characters. Besides, from detailed observation of structural dynamics during
phase transition, we discover that the global phase transition is associated
with changes in the equilibrium value and fluctuations of each polarization

Constrained Wardrop Equilibrium (ICWE) for this class of congestion games and
studying its basic properties, we turn to our main focus: whether additional

costs/delays). We formulate this question in the form of Informational Braes'
Paradox (IBP), which extends the classic Braess' Paradox in traffic equilibria,
and asks whether users receiving additional information can become worse off.
We provide a comprehensive answer to this question showing that in any network
in the series of linearly independent (SLI) class, which is a strict subset of
series-parallel networks, IBP cannot occur, and in any network that is not in
the SLI class, there exists a configuration of edge-specific cost functions for
which IBP will occur. In the process, we establish several properties of the
SLI class of networks, which include the characterization of the complement of
the SLI class in terms of embedding a specific set of networks, and also an

assess the importance and features of this kind of scattering, we derive the
effective magnon-phonon interaction from a microscopic model, including band
energy, a screened electron-electron interaction and the electron-phonon
interaction. Unlike higher order magnon-only scattering, we find that the
coupling with phonons induce a scattering which is very small for low-energy

with autocorrelated errors, as implemented in the current version of the fourth
author's mgcv package (1.8.9): the possibility to specify an ar(1) error model
for Gaussian models, and the possibility of using factor smooths for
random-effect factors such as subject and item. These factor smooths are set up
to have the same smoothing parameters, and are penalized to yield the
non-linear equivalent of random intercepts and random slopes in the classical
linear framework. Three case studies illustrate these issues.

have indicated that, despite the severe field line gradients of the QSL, the
presence of a null is vital in maintaining fast reconnection. Here, we explore
this notion using highly resolved simulations of the full MHD evolution. We
show that for the null-point configuration, the resistive scaling of the peak
current density is close to $J\sim\eta^{-1}$, while the scaling is much weaker,
i.e. $J\sim\eta^{-0.4}$, when only the QSL connectivity gradients provide a

A few objects have been well-characterized with photometric campaigns in the

measure or constrain the interior structure and spin rate of WDs which have
spent gigayears accreting material from their companion, undergoing thousands
of nova outbursts in the process. In addition, variations in the surface
temperature affect the site of mode driving, and provide unique and challenging
tests for mode driving theories previously applied to isolated WD's. Having
undergone long-term accretion, these WDs are expected to have been spun up.
Spin periods in the range 60-100 seconds have been measured by other means for
two objects, GW Lib and V455 And. Compared to typical mode frequencies, the
spin frequency may be similar or higher, and the Coriolis force can no longer
be treated as a small perturbation on the fluid motions. We present the results
of a non-perturbative calculation of the normal modes of these WDs, using
interior thermal structures appropriate to accreting systems. This includes a
discussion of the surface brightness distributions, which are strongly modified
from the non-rotating case. Using the measured spin period of approximately 100
seconds, we show that the observed pulsations from GW Lib are consistent with
the three lowest azimuthal order rotationally modified modes that have the
highest frequency in the stellar frame. The high frequencies are needed for the
convective driving, but are then apparently shifted to lower frequencies by a

of a convective blueshift that varies across the stellar disc and non-Gaussian
stellar photospheric profiles. We simulated an aligned hot Jupiter with a 4 d
orbit about a Sun-like star and injected centre-to-limb velocity (and profile
shape) variations based on radiative 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
solar surface convection. The residuals between our modelling and classical RM
modelling were dependent on the intrinsic profile width and v sin i; the
amplitude of the residuals increased with increasing v sin i, and with
decreasing intrinsic profile width. For slowly rotating stars the
centre-to-limb convective variation dominated the residuals (with amplitudes of
10s of cm/s to ~1 m/s); however, for faster rotating stars the dominant
residual signature was due a non-Gaussian intrinsic profile (with amplitudes
from 0.5-9 m/s). When the impact factor was 0, neglecting to account for the
convective centre-to-limb variation led to an uncertainty in the obliquity of
~10-20 degrees, even though the true v sin i was known. Additionally,
neglecting to properly model an asymmetric intrinsic profile had a greater
impact for more rapidly rotating stars (e.g. v sin i = 6 km/s), and caused
systematic errors on the order of ~20 degrees in the measured obliquities.
Hence, neglecting the impact of stellar surface convection may bias star-planet
alignment measurements and consequently also theories on planetary migration
and evolution.

an arbitrary shape is developed. The particles are perfectly conducting or
impedance. For a small impedance particle of an arbitrary shape an explicit
analytical formula is derived for the scattering amplitude. The formula holds
as $a\to 0$, where $a$ is a characteristic size of the small particle and the
wavelength is arbitrary but fixed. The scattering amplitude for a small
impedance particle is shown to be proportional to $a^{2-\kappa}$, where
$\kappa\in [0,1)$ is a parameter which can be chosen by an experimenter as
he/she wants. The boundary impedance of a small particle is assumed to be of
the form $\zeta=ha^{-\kappa}$, where $h=$const, Re$h\ge 0$. The scattering
amplitude for a small perfectly conducting particle is proportional to $a^3$,
it is much smaller than that for the small impedance particle. The many-body
scattering problem is solved under the physical assumptions $a\ll d\ll
\lambda$, where $d$ is the minimal distance between neighboring particles and
$\lambda$ is the wavelength. The distribution law for the small impedance
particles is $\mathcal{N}(\delta)\sim\int_{\delta}N(x)dx$ as $a\to 0$. Here
$N(x)\ge 0$ is an arbitrary continuous function that can be chosen by the
experimenter and $\mathcal{N}(\delta)$ is the number of particles in an
arbitrary sub-domain $\Delta$. It is proved that the EM field in the medium
where many small particles, impedance or perfectly conducting, are distributed,
has a limit, as $a\to 0$ and a differential equation is derived for the
limiting field. On this basis the recipe is given for creating materials with a
desired refraction coefficient by embedding many small impedance particles into

magnetoresistance (MR) when the applied magnetic field is parallel to the
current direction as observed in several topological semimetals (TSMs)
including Dirac semimetals (DSMs) and Weyl semimetals (WSMs). Usually, these
two exotic phenomena emerge in distinct materials with or without time reversal
symmetry (TRS), respectively. Here we report the discovery of a new member in
TSMs, TaSb2, which clearly exhibits both of these phenomena in a single
material. This compound crystallizes in a base-centered monoclinic,
centrosymmetric structure, and is metallic with a low carrier density in the
zero field. While applying magnetic field it exhibits insulating behavior
before appearance of a resistivity plateau below Tc =13 K. In the plateau
regime, the ultrahigh carrier mobility and extreme magnetoresistance (XMR) for
the field perpendicular to the current are observed as in DSMs and WSMs, in
addition to a quantum oscillation behavior with non-trivial Berry phases. In
contrast to the most known DSMs and WSMs, the negative MR in TaSb2 does not
saturate up to 9 T, which, together with the almost linear Hall resistivity,
manifests itself an electron-hole non-compensated TMS. These findings indicate
that the resistivity plateau could be a generic feature of topology-protected
metallic states even in the absence of TRS and compatible with the negative MR
depending on the field direction. Our experiment extends a materials basis
represented by TaSb2 as a new platform for future theoretical investigations
and device applications of topological materials.

using transposition in place of harmonic progression. A transposition scale is
introduced to provide a set of intervals commensurate with the musical scale,
such as chromatic or just intonation scales. A sequence of intervals selected
from the transposition scale is used to shift instrument frequency at
predefined times during the composition which serves as a harmonic sequence of
a composition. A transposition sequence constructed in such a way can be
extended to a hierarchy of sequences. The fundamental sound frequency of an
instrument is obtained as a product of the base frequency, instrument key
factor, and a cumulative product of respective factors from all the harmonic
sequences. The multiplication factors are selected from subsets of rational
numbers, which form instrument scales and transposition scales of different
levels. Each harmonic sequence can be related to its own transposition scale,
or a single scale can be used for all levels. When composing for an orchestra
of instruments, harmonic sequences and instrument scales can be assigned
independently to each musical instrument. The method solves the problem of
using just intonation scale across multiple octaves as well as simplifies

the Cosmological HI Power Spectrum Estimator (CHIPS), an algorithm developed

the two-dimensional and spherically-averaged power spectrum of brightness
temperature fluctuations. The principal motivations for CHIPS are the
application of realistic instrumental and foreground models to form the optimal
estimator, thereby maximising the likelihood of unbiased signal estimation, and
allowing a full covariant understanding of the outputs. CHIPS employs an
inverse-covariance weighting of the data through the maximum likelihood
estimator, thereby allowing use of the full parameter space for signal
estimation (""foreground suppression""). We describe the motivation for the
algorithm, implementation, application to real and simulated data, and early
outputs. Upon application to a set of 3 hours of data, we set a 2$\sigma$ upper
limit on the EoR dimensionless power at $k=0.05$~h.Mpc$^{-1}$ of
$\Delta_k^2<7.6\times{10^4}$~mK$^2$ in the redshift range $z=[6.2-6.6]$,

is found to be in hard and hard-intermediate spectral states only during entire

class of sources (e.g., MAXI~J1659-152, Swift~J1753.5-0127, etc.) that have
very short orbital periods and that companion is profusely mass-losing or the
disk is immersed inside an excretion disk. In these cases, flows in the
accretion disk is primarily dominated by low viscous sub-Keplerian flow and the
Keplerian rate is not high enough to initiate softer states. Low-frequency
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are observed sporadically although as in
normal outbursts of transient black holes, monotonic evolutions of QPO
frequency during both rising and declining phases are observed. From the TCAF
fits, we find mass of the black hole in the range of $7.5-11~M_\odot$ and from

nanomagnets remain in the vortex state until they are reset by a strong
magnetic field to the initial single domain state, making the vortex state

architecture for frequency-selective channels. Multi-carrier techniques such as
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are employed to handle
inter-symbol interference (ISI). A frequency-domain equalizer is designed for
mitigating the inter-carrier interference (ICI) introduced by the nonlinearity
of one-bit quantization. For static single-input-multiple-output (SIMO)
channels, a closed-form expression of the generalized mutual information (GMI)
is derived, and based on which the linear frequency-domain equalizer is
optimized. The analysis is then extended to ergodic time-varying SIMO channels
with estimated channel state information (CSI), where numerically tight lower
and upper bounds of the GMI are derived. The analytical framework is naturally
applicable to the multi-user scenario, for both static and time-varying
channels. Extensive numerical studies reveal that the mixed-ADC architecture
with a small proportion of high-resolution ADCs does achieve a dominant portion
of the achievable rate of ideal conventional architecture, and that it
remarkably improves the performance as compared with one-bit massive MIMO.

This was reported by two radio observatories, both of which explained this
frequency dependent and time varying delay as being due to refractive effects
of ionized shells in the Crab Nebula. Both groups also noted that, curiously
and confusingly coincident with the frequency dependent delay, the Crab Pulsar
also underwent an unusual slowing down, which they believed to be unrelated to
the Crab Nebula and instead intrinsic to the Crab Pulsar, resulting in an
additional delay that was frequency independent. However, it now appears that
one of the groups attributes the frequency independent delay also to refractive
effects. This work aims to verify whether at least a part of the frequency
independent delay is indeed due to intrinsic slowing down of the Crab Pulsar.
Timing analysis of the Crab Pulsar's October 1997 event has been done in
X-rays, which are not delayed by the refractive and diffractive effects that
affect radio waves; at X-rays only the intrinsic slowing down should contribute
to any observed delay. Data mainly from the PCA instrument aboard the RXTE
satellite have been used, along with a small amount of data from the PDS
instrument aboard the BeppoSAX satellite. Analysis of the X-ray data, using the
very accurate reference timing mode derived at radio frequencies, strongly
supports the intrinsic slowing down hypothesis. Analysis using the reference
timing model derived self-consistently from the limited X-ray data, which is
less accurate, is not completely unambiguous regarding the above two
hypotheses, but provides reasonable support for the intrinsic slowing down
hypothesis. A significant fraction of the frequency independent delay during
the October 1997 event is indeed due to intrinsic slowing down of the Crab
Pulsar.

the specific accretion rate i.e., lambda_SAR, distribution function (SARDF) up
to z~2.5 with ~1000 X-ray selected AGN from XMM-COSMOS. Using a maximum
likelihood approach, we jointly fit the stellar mass function and specific
accretion rate distribution function, with the X-ray luminosity function as an
additional constraint. Our best fit model characterizes the SARDF as a double
power-law with mass dependent but redshift independent break whose low
lambda_SAR slope flattens with increasing redshift while the normalization
increases. This implies that, for a given stellar mass, higher lambda_SAR
objects have a peak in their space density at earlier epoch compared to the
lower lambda_SAR ones, following and mimicking the well known AGN cosmic
downsizing as observed in the AGN luminosity function. The mass function of
active galaxies is described by a Schechter function with a almost constant
Mstar* and a low mass slope alpha that flattens with redshift. Compared to the
stellar mass function, we find that the HGMF has a similar shape and that, up
to log((Mstar/Msun)~11.5 the ratio of AGN host galaxies to star forming
galaxies is basically constant (~10%). Finally, the comparison of the AGN HGMF
for different luminosity and specific accretion rate sub-classes with the
phenomenological model prediction by Peng et al. (2010) for the ""transient""
population, i.e. galaxies in the process of being mass-quenched, reveals that
low-luminosity AGN do not appear to be able to contribute significantly to the
quenching and that at least at high masses, i.e. Mstar>10^(10.7) Msun ,
feedback from luminous AGN (log(Lbol)>~46 [erg/s]) may be responsible for the
quenching of star formation in the host galaxy.

known as global image descriptors between a query image and the database
images. Due to their success in large scale image classification,
representations extracted from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are quickly
gaining ground on Fisher Vectors (FVs) as state-of-the-art global descriptors
for image instance retrieval. While CNN-based descriptors are generally
remarked for good retrieval performance at lower bitrates, they nevertheless
present a number of drawbacks including the lack of robustness to common object
transformations such as rotations compared with their interest point based FV
counterparts.
  In this paper, we propose a method for computing invariant global descriptors
from CNNs. Our method implements a recently proposed mathematical theory for
invariance in a sensory cortex modeled as a feedforward neural network. The
resulting global descriptors can be made invariant to multiple arbitrary
transformation groups while retaining good discriminativeness.
  Based on a thorough empirical evaluation using several publicly available
datasets, we show that our method is able to significantly and consistently
improve retrieval results every time a new type of invariance is incorporated.
We also show that our method which has few parameters is not prone to
overfitting: improvements generalize well across datasets with different
properties with regard to invariances. Finally, we show that our descriptors
are able to compare favourably to other state-of-the-art compact descriptors in
similar bitranges, exceeding the highest retrieval results reported in the
literature on some datasets. A dedicated dimensionality reduction step
--quantization or hashing-- may be able to further improve the competitiveness
of the descriptors.

membrane represents the crucial first step before active internalization and is
governed by thermal diffusion. Using a fully analytical theory we show that the
stretching and bending of the elastic membrane by the approaching particle
induces a memory in the system which leads to anomalous diffusion, even though
the particle is immersed in a purely Newtonian liquid. For typical cell
membranes the transient subdiffusive regime extends beyond 10 ms and can
enhance residence times and possibly binding rates up to 50\%. Our analytical

The implementation of deflection demonstration missions offers the great

asteroid surfaces. In this contribution, we discuss the role of uncertainties
in the NEOTwIST asteroid deflection demonstration concept, a low-cost kinetic
impactor design elaborated in the framework of the NEOShield project. The aim
of NEOTwIST is to change the spin state of a known and well characterized
near-Earth object, in this case the asteroid (25143) Itokawa. Fast events such
as the production of the impact crater and ejecta are studied via cube-sat
chasers and a flyby vehicle. Long term changes, for instance, in the asteroid's
spin and orbit, can be assessed using ground based observations. We find that
such a mission can indeed provide valuable constraints on mitigation relevant
parameters. Furthermore, the here proposed kinetic impact scenarios can be
implemented within the next two decades without threatening Earth's safety.

single-particle gap of a band insulator into a Mott gap in the strong
correlation limit. However understanding the nature of possible phases in
between these two extreme insulating phases remains an outstanding challenge.
We find two strongly correlated insulating phases in between the above
extremes: (i) The insulating phase just before the Mott phase can be viewed as
gapping a non-Fermi liquid state of spinons through staggered ionic potential.
The quasi-particles of underlying spinons are orthogonal to physical electrons
and hence they do not couple to photoemission probes, giving rise to
""ARPES-dark"" state due to which the ARPES gap will be larger than optical and
thermal gap. (ii) The correlated insulating phase just after the normal band
insulator corresponds to the ordered phase of slave Ising spins (Ising
insulator) where charge configuration is controlled by an underlying Ising
variable which indirectly couples to external magnetic field and hence gives
rise to additional temperature and field dependence in semiconducting
properties. In the absence of tunability for the Hubbard $U$, such a
temperature and field dependence can be conveniently employed to achieve
further control on the transport properties of Ising-based semiconductors. The
rare earth monochalcogenide semiconductors where the magneto-resistance is
anomalously large can be a candidate system for the ordered phase of Ising
variable where pairs of charge bosons are condensed in the background.
Combining present results with our previous dynamical mean field theory study,
we argue that the present picture holds if the ionic potential is strong enough
to survive the downward renormalization of the ionic potential caused by
Hubbard $U$.

dielectric and piezoelectric response of ferroelectric materials. The domain
wall motion through the ferroelectric material is however hindered by pinning
on crystal defects which substantially reduces these contributions. Here, using
thermodynamic models based on the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory, we find a
relation between microscopic reversible motion of non-ferroelastic 180-degree
domain walls interacting with a periodic array of pinning centers and the
nonlinear macroscopic permittivity. We show, that the reversible motion of
domain walls can be split into two basic modes. First, the bending of a domain
wall between pinning centers, and, second, the uniform movement of domain wall
plane. We show that their respective contributions may change when the
distribution of pinning centers is rearranged during the material aging. We
demonstrate that it is possible to indicate which mechanism of the domain wall
motion is affected during material aging. This allows to judge whether the
defects only homogeneously accumulate at domain walls or prefer to align in
certain directions inside the domain wall plane. We suggest that this
information can be obtained using simple macroscopic dielectric measurements
and a proper analysis of the nonlinear response. Our results may therefore
serve as a simple and useful tool to obtain details on domain wall pinning in

flux is trapped as quantized vortices, which yield additional dissipation and
contribute to the residual resistance. Recently, cooling down with a large
spatial temperature gradient attracts much attention for successful reductions
of trapped vortices. The purpose of the present paper is to propose a model to
explain the observed efficient flux expulsions and the role of spatial
temperature gradient during the cool-down of cavity. In the vicinity of a
region with a temperature close to the critical temperature Tc,the critical
fields are strongly suppressed and can be smaller than the ambient magnetic
field. A region with a lower critical field smaller than the ambient field is
in the vortex state. As a material is cooled down, a region with a temperature
close Tc associating the vortex state domain sweeps and passes through the
material. In this process, vortices contained in the vortex state domain are
trapped by pinning centers that randomly distribute in the material. A number
of trapped vortices can be naively estimated by using the analogy with the
beam-target collision event. Based on this result, the residual resistance is
evaluated. We find that a number of trapped vortices and the residual
resistance are proportional to the strength of the ambient magnetic field and
the inverse of the temperature gradient. The obtained residual resistance
agrees well with experimental results. A material property dependence of a
number of trapped vortices is also discussed.

migration that allows the method to image scatterers when the wave field phase
information is lost at the receivers, and only intensities are measured. The
resulting imaging method does not require knowing the phases of the probing
field or manipulating the phase of the wave field at the receivers. In a regime
where the scattered field is small compared to the probing field, the problem
of recovering the full-waveform scattered field from intensity data can be
formulated as an embarrassingly simple least-squares problem. Although this
only recovers the projection (on a known subspace) of the full-waveform
scattered field, we show that, for high frequencies, this projection gives
Kirchhoff images asymptotically identical to the images obtained with full
waveform data. Our method can also be used when the source is modulated by a
Gaussian process and autocorrelations are measured at an array of receivers.

operation of the efficiency or the diagnostics of the photovoltaic generator.
The photovoltaic module is generally represented by an equivalent circuit whose
parameters are experimentally calculated by using the characteristic
current-tension, I-V. The precise determination of these parameters stays a
challenge for the researchers, what led to a big diversification in the models
and the digital methods dedicated to their characterizations. In the present
paper; we are interested in the parametric characterization of a model in both
following cases: with single and two diodes, in order to plan the behavior of
the photovoltaic generator under real functioning conditions. We developed an
identification method of the parameters using Newton Raphson's method by using
the software Matlab/Simulink. This method is a fast technique which allows the
identification of several parameters and can be used in real time applications.
The results of the proposed method show a high agreement between the

of universe corresponding to the cosmological equations with the pseudoscalar
torsion function are investigated. The cosmological constant is found to be the
intrinsic torsion and curvature of the vacuum universe and is derived from the
theory naturally rather than added artificially, i.e. the dark energy
originates from geometry and includes the cosmological constant but differs
from it. The cosmological constant puzzle, the coincidence and fine tuning
problem are relieved naturally at the same time. By solving the cosmological
equations, the analytic cosmological solution is obtained and can be compared
with the LCDM model. In addition, the expressions of density parameters of the
matter and the geometric dark energy are derived, and it is shown that the
evolution of state equations for the geometric dark energy agrees with the
current observational data. At last, the full equations of linear cosmological
perturbations and the solutions are obtained.

algebras started in [A.Bulatov, The Graph of a Relational Structure and
Constraint Satisfaction Problems, LICS, 2004]. We introduce a graph-like
structure on an arbitrary finite idempotent algebra omitting type 1. We show
that this graph is connected, its edges can be classified into 3 types
corresponding to the local behavior (semilattice, majority, or affine) of
certain term operations, and that the structure of the algebra can be
`improved' without introducing type 1 by choosing an appropriate reduct of the
original algebra. Then we refine this structure demonstrating that the edges of
the graph of an algebra can be made `thin', that is, there are term operations
that behave very similar to semilattice, majority, or affine operations on
2-element subsets of the algebra. Finally, we prove certain connectivity
properties of the refined structures.
  This research is motivated by the study of the Constraint Satisfaction
Problem, although the problem itself does not really show up in this paper.
