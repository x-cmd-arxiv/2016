correlated sources exchanging bidirectional information. In the case, when both
sources have the knowledge of correlation statistics, a source compression with
physical-layer network coding (SCPNC) scheme is proposed to perform the
distributed compression at each source node. When only the relay has the
knowledge of correlation statistics, we propose a relay compression with
physical-layer network coding (RCPNC) scheme to compress the bidirectional
messages at the relay. The closed-form block error rate (BLER) expressions of
both schemes are derived and verified through simulations. It is shown that the
proposed schemes achieve considerable improvements in both error performance
and throughput compared with the conventional non-compression scheme in
correlated two-way relay networks (CTWRNs).

computation-efficient and communication-efficient. Theoretical analysis shows
that SCOPE is convergent with linear convergence rate when the objective

spatial resolution using a phase-sensitive interferometer. By simultaneously
visualizing the local phase and amplitude of the driven motion, we show that
unexplained spectral features represent split degenerate modes. When taking
these into account, the resonance frequencies up to the eighth vibrational mode
agree with theory. The corresponding displacement profiles however, are
remarkably different from theory, as small imperfections increasingly deform
the nodal lines for the higher modes. The Brownian motion, which is used to

likelihood from a multivariate linear regression model with errors from a scale
mixture of normals is combined with the standard non-informative prior. There
is a simple data augmentation algorithm (based on latent data from the mixing
density) that can be used to explore $\pi$. Let $h(\cdot)$ and $d$ denote the
mixing density and the dimension of the regression model, respectively. Hobert
et al. (2016) [arXiv:1506.03113v2] have recently shown that, if $h$ converges
to 0 at the origin at an appropriate rate, and $\int_0^\infty u^{\frac{d}{2}}
\, h(u) \, du < \infty$, then the Markov chains underlying the DA algorithm and
an alternative Haar PX-DA algorithm are both geometrically ergodic. In fact,
something much stronger than geometric ergodicity often holds. Indeed, it is
shown in this paper that, under simple conditions on $h$, the Markov operators
defined by the DA and Haar PX-DA Markov chains are trace-class, i.e., compact
with summable eigenvalues. Many of the mixing densities that satisfy Hobert et
al.'s (2016) conditions also satisfy the new conditions developed in this
paper. Thus, for this set of mixing densities, the new results provide a
substantial strengthening of Hobert et al.'s (2016) conclusion without any
additional assumptions. For example, Hobert et al. (2016) showed that the DA
and Haar PX-DA Markov chains are geometrically ergodic whenever the mixing
density is generalized inverse Gaussian, log-normal, Fr\'{e}chet (with shape
parameter larger than $d/2$), or inverted gamma (with shape parameter larger
than $d/2$). The results in this paper show that, in each of these cases, the

a basic element of many electrochemical engineering and microfluidic processes.
Such current passage is diffusion-limited: it induces a decrease of electrolyte
concentration towards the interface (concentration polarization, CP), expressed
in the saturation of current upon increasing voltage at some value (limiting
current, LC). With further increase of voltage, this saturation breaks down
(overlimiting conductance, OLC). In open systems OLC is mediated by a
microscale vortical flow which develops as a result of electroconvective
instability (ECI) of quiescent CP near LC. Electroconvection (EC) is a flow
driven by the electric force acting either upon the space charge of the
interfacial EDL (electroosmosis, EO) or the residual space charge of the
quasielectroneutral bulk (bulk EC). There are two types of EO, the equilibrium
and the nonequilibrium one. The former relates to the action of the tangential
electric field upon the space charge of the EDL, and the latter pertains to the
similar action upon the extended space charge, forming next to the EDL near LC.
For a perfectly charge-selective interface, CP is stable under the equilibrium
EO or bulk EC, but nonequilibrium EO may cause ECI. For this reason until
recently, ECI in CP was attributed to this latter mechanism. Lately, it was
shown that imperfect charge-selectivity of the interface makes equilibrium ECI
possible, driven by either equilibrium EO or bulk EC, or both. Here we identify
and analyze the major surface and bulk factors affecting the ECI. These factors
(diffusioosmosis, EO, bulk EC, and some newly identified ones) are
manifestations of the electric force and pressure gradient, balanced by the
viscous force acting in various locations in solution. The contribution of
these factors to ECI in CP is analyzed for a varying interface permselectivity.

  Diffuse Optical Tomography",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In nonlinear imaging problems whose forward model is described by a partial
differential equation (PDE), the main computational bottleneck in solving the
inverse problem is the need to solve many large-scale discretized PDEs at each
step of the optimization process. In the context of absorption imaging in
diffuse optical tomography, one approach to addressing this bottleneck proposed
recently (de Sturler, et al, 2015) reformulates the viewing of the forward
problem as a differential algebraic system, and then employs model order
reduction (MOR). However, the construction of the reduced model requires the
solution of several full order problems (i.e. the full discretized PDE for
multiple right-hand sides) to generate a candidate global basis. This step is
then followed by a rank-revealing factorization of the matrix containing the
candidate basis in order to compress the basis to a size suitable for
constructing the reduced transfer function. The present paper addresses the
costs associated with the global basis approximation in two ways. First, we use
the structure of the matrix to rewrite the full order transfer function, and
corresponding derivatives, such that the full order systems to be solved are
symmetric (positive definite in the zero frequency case). Then we apply MOR to
the new formulation of the problem. Second, we give an approach to computing
the global basis approximation dynamically as the full order systems are
solved. In this phase, only the incrementally new, relevant information is
added to the existing global basis, and redundant information is not computed.
This new approach is achieved by an inner-outer Krylov recycling approach which
has potential use in other applications as well. We show the value of the new
approach to approximate global basis computation on two DOT absorption image
reconstruction problems.

periphery of active regions close to sunspots. We discuss the physical
parameters of the jets and their relation with other phenomena such as H alpha
surges, nonthermal type III radio bursts and hard X-ray emission. Using AIA
wavelength channels sensitive to coronal temperatures, we studied the
temperature distribution in the jets using the line-of-sight Differential
Emission Measure technique. We also investigated the role of the photospheric
magnetic field using the LOS magnetogram data from the HMI. The lifetime of
jets range from 5 to 39 minutes with an average of 18 minutes and their
velocities range from 87 to 532 km/s with an average of 271 km/s. Most of the
jets are co-temporal with nonthermal type III radio bursts observed by the
Wind/WAVES spacecraft. We confirm the source region of these bursts using the
Potential Field Source Surface technique. 10 out of 20 events showed that the
jets originated in a region of flux cancellation and 6 jets in a region of flux
emergence. 4 events showed flux emergence and then cancellation during the jet
evolution. DEM analyses showed that for most of the spires of the jets, the DEM
peaked at around log T [K] = 6.2/6.3. In addition, we derived an emission
measure and a lower limit of electron density at the location of the spire and
the footpoint. These results are in agreement with those obtained earlier by
studying individual active region jets. The observation of flux cancellation,
the association with HXR emission and emission of nonthermal type III radio
bursts, suggest that the initiation and therefore, heating is taking place at
the base of the jet. This is also supported by the high temperature plasma
revealed by the DEM analysis in the jet footpoint. Our results provide
substantial constraints for theoretical modeling of the jets and their
thermodynamic nature.

existence, which includes monitoring of more than one reliable precursor

reversion rates (a measure of cross-sectional mean reversion) for different

and volatilities vary across different economic agents, and hence applies to
Gibrat's law and its extensions. Second, we present techniques to estimate
these two factors using panel data. Third, we show how our results offer a
structural explanation for a generalized size effect in which higher-ranked
processes grow more slowly than lower-ranked processes on average. Finally, we
employ our empirical methods using panel data on commodity prices and show that

while reasoning about uncertainties in the network. While previous work
presents influence maximizing techniques to choose intervention participants,
they do not address three real-world issues: (i) they completely fail to scale
up to real-world sizes; (ii) they do not handle deviations in execution of
intervention plans; (iii) constructing real-world social networks is an
expensive process. HEALER handles these issues via four major contributions:
(i) HEALER casts this influence maximization problem as a POMDP and solves it
using a novel planner which scales up to previously unsolvable real-world
sizes; (ii) HEALER allows shelter officials to modify its recommendations, and
updates its future plans in a deviation-tolerant manner; (iii) HEALER
constructs social networks of homeless youth at low cost, using a Facebook
application. Finally, (iv) we show hardness results for the problem that HEALER
solves. HEALER will be deployed in the real world in early Spring 2016 and is

services in extended areas with homogeneous Quality of Service (QoS) levels.
Conventional cellular architectures might not be able to satisfy these
requirements due to the effect of surrounding obstacles and the signal
attenuation with distance, in particular under Non Line of Sight (NLOS)
propagation conditions. Recent studies have investigated the potential of
Multi-hop Cellular Networks (MCNs) to overcome the traditional cellular
architecture limitations through the integration of cellular and ad-hoc
networking technologies. However, these studies are generally analytical or
simulation-based. On the other hand, this paper reports the first experimental
field tests that validate and quantify the benefits that MCNs using mobile
relays can provide over traditional cellular systems.

essential for identifying properties such as liquid level and phase boundaries,
which are vital for controlling numerous processes in the industry and
chemistry laboratory. This work presents a computer vision method for
identifying the boundary of materials in transparent vessels using the
graph-cut algorithm. The method receives an image of a transparent vessel
containing a material and the contour of the vessel in the image. The boundary
of the material in the vessel is found by the graph cut method. In general the
method uses the vessel region of the image to create a graph, where pixels are
vertices, and the cost of an edge between two pixels is inversely correlated
with their intensity difference. The bottom 10% of the vessel region in the
image is assumed to correspond to the material phase and defined as the graph
and source. The top 10% of the pixels in the vessels are assumed to correspond
to the air phase and defined as the graph sink. The minimal cut that splits the
resulting graph between the source and sink (hence, material and air) is traced
using the max-flow/min-cut approach. This cut corresponds to the boundary of
the material in the image. The method gave high accuracy in boundary
recognition for a wide range of liquid, solid, granular and powder materials in
various glass vessels from everyday life and the chemistry laboratory, such as
bottles, jars, Glasses, Chromotography colums and separatory funnels.

following assertions are equivalent:
  (a) There is a constant $C_{p_{1},...,p_{m}}^{Y}\geq 1$ such that
\begin{equation*} \left( \sum_{j_{1}=1}^{\infty }\left( \sum_{j_{2}=1}^{\infty

the above result we generalize to the $m$-linear setting one of the classical
Hardy--Littlewood inequalities for bilinear forms. Our result is sharp in a
very strong sense: the constants and exponents are optimal, even if we consider

numerical method for solving hyperbolic conservation laws designed to reduce
the Gibbs oscillations, if existent, by adaptively choosing the local stencil
for the interpolation. The original ENO method is constructed based on the
polynomial interpolation and the overall rate of convergence provided by the
method is uniquely determined by the total number of interpolation points
involved for the approximation. In this paper, we propose simple non-polynomial
ENO and weighted ENO (WENO) finite volume methods in order to enhance the local
accuracy and convergence. We first adopt the infinitely smooth radial basis
functions (RBFs) for a non-polynomial interpolation. Particularly we use the
multi-quadric and Gaussian RBFs. The non-polynomial interpolation such as the
RBF interpolation offers the flexibility to control the local error by
optimizing the free parameter. Then we show that the non-polynomial
interpolation can be represented as a perturbation of the polynomial
interpolation. That is, it is not necessary to know the exact form of the
non-polynomial basis for the interpolation. In this paper, we formulate the ENO
and WENO methods based on the non-polynomial interpolation and derive the
optimization condition of the perturbation. To guarantee the essentially
non-oscillatory property, we switch the non-polynomial reconstruction to the
polynomial reconstruction adaptively near the non-smooth area by using the
monotone polynomial interpolation method. The numerical results show that the
developed non-polynomial ENO and WENO methods enhance the local accuracy.

in $2D$ regarding what symmetry fractionalization patterns are possible, the
situation in $3D$ is much more open. A new feature in $3D$ is the existence of
loop excitations, so to study $3D$ SET phases, first we need to understand how
to properly describe the fractionalized action of symmetry on loops. Using a
dimensional reduction procedure, we show that these loop excitations exist as
the boundary between two $2D$ SET phases, and the symmetry action is
characterized by the corresponding difference in SET orders. Moreover, similar
to the $2D$ case, we find that some seemingly possible symmetry
fractionalization patterns are actually anomalous and cannot be realized
strictly in $3D$. We detect such anomalies using the flux fusion method we
introduced previously in $2D$. To illustrate these ideas, we use the $3D$ $Z_2$
gauge theory with $Z_2$ global symmetry as an example, and enumerate and
describe the corresponding SET phases. In particular, we find four
non-anomalous SET phases and one anomalous SET phase, which we show can be

that solving the RMAB problem is PSPACE-hard, with the optimal policy usually
intractable due to the exponential computation complexity. A natural
alternative is to consider the easily implementable myopic policy that

assumptions on the data distribution. Specifically, subject to mild moment
conditions on the kernel, we establish the explicit rate of convergence that
decays polynomially in sample size for a high-dimensional scaling limit, where
the dimension can be much larger than the sample size. We also supplement a
practical Gaussian wild bootstrap method to approximate the quantiles of the
maxima of centered U-statistics and prove its asymptotic validity. The wild
bootstrap is demonstrated on statistical applications for high-dimensional
non-Gaussian data including: (i) principled and data-dependent tuning parameter
selection for regularized estimation of the covariance matrix and its related
functionals; (ii) simultaneous inference for the covariance and rank
correlation matrices. In particular, for the thresholded covariance matrix
estimator with the bootstrap selected tuning parameter, we show that the
Gaussian-like convergence rates can be achieved for heavy-tailed data, which
are less conservative than those obtained by the Bonferroni technique that
ignores the dependency in the underlying data distribution. In addition, we
also show that even for subgaussian distributions, error bounds of the
bootstrapped thresholded covariance matrix estimator can be much tighter than
those of the minimax estimator with a universal threshold.

pairs $(\hat{p}_i, \hat{\sigma}_{p_i})$ were compared for agreement between
nominal confidence level ($\xi$) and calculated coverage values ($C$). Large
$\xi$-to-$C$ inconsistency for large $b$ and $ p_i \gg \frac{1}{b}$ arises for

$\alpha_0$ in a more general prior pdf

the original multinomial estimators, a new discrete-domain estimator

achieve $\hat{p}_i$-to-$p_i$ matching equivalent to that found for
$\hat{p}(n_i,N)$, $(\hat{p_i})_{\bowtie}$ or the original multinomial

restricted to small dimensions mainly due to the computational constraints that
the dictionary learning problem entails. In the context of image processing,
this implies handling small image patches. In this work we show how to
efficiently handle bigger dimensions and go beyond the small patches in
sparsity-based signal and image processing methods. We build our approach based
on a new cropped wavelet decomposition, which enables a multi-scale analysis
with virtually no border effects. We then employ this as the base dictionary

To cope with the increase of training data, while at the same time improving
the training performance, we present an Online Sparse Dictionary Learning

millions of examples. This work shows that dictionary learning can be up-scaled

transforms that generalize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by using
curvilinear instead of linear features. DRR identifies the nonlinear features
through multivariate regression to ensure the reduction in redundancy between
he PCA coefficients, the reduction of the variance of the scores, and the
reduction in the reconstruction error. More importantly, unlike other nonlinear
dimensionality reduction methods, the invertibility, volume-preservation, and
straightforward out-of-sample extension, makes DRR interpretable and easy to
apply. The properties of DRR enable learning a more broader class of data
manifolds than the recently proposed Non-linear Principal Components Analysis
(NLPCA) and Principal Polynomial Analysis (PPA). We illustrate the performance
of the representation in reducing the dimensionality of remote sensing data. In
particular, we tackle two common problems: processing very high dimensional
spectral information such as in hyperspectral image sounding data, and dealing
with spatial-spectral image patches of multispectral images. Both settings pose
collinearity and ill-determination problems. Evaluation of the expressive power
of the features is assessed in terms of truncation error, estimating
atmospheric variables, and surface land cover classification error. Results
show that DRR outperforms linear PCA and recently proposed invertible
extensions based on neural networks (NLPCA) and univariate regressions (PPA).

factors of many phenomena are not well known. Consequently, irrelevant and
redundant features artificially increase the size of datasets, which
complicates learning tasks, such as regression. To address this problem,
feature selection methods have been proposed. This paper introduces a new
supervised filter based on the Morisita estimator of intrinsic dimension. It
can identify relevant features and distinguish between redundant and irrelevant
information. Besides, it offers a clear graphical representation of the
results, and it can be easily implemented in different programming languages.
Comprehensive numerical experiments are conducted using simulated datasets
characterized by different levels of complexity, sample size and noise. The
suggested algorithm is also successfully tested on a selection of real world
applications and compared with RReliefF using extreme learning machine. In
addition, a new measure of feature relevance is presented and discussed.

working in wavelet representations. However, analytical estimates can be
obtained only for particular combinations of analytical models of signal and
noise, thus precluding its straightforward extension to deal with other
arbitrary noise sources. In this paper, we propose an alternative non-explicit
way to take into account the relations among natural image wavelet coefficients
for denoising: we use support vector regression (SVR) in the wavelet domain to
enforce these relations in the estimated signal. Since relations among the
coefficients are specific to the signal, the regularization property of SVR is
exploited to remove the noise, which does not share this feature. The specific
signal relations are encoded in an anisotropic kernel obtained from mutual
information measures computed on a representative image database. Training
considers minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the
estimated and actual probability functions of signal and noise in order to
enforce similarity. Due to its non-parametric nature, the method can eventually
cope with different noise sources without the need of an explicit
re-formulation, as it is strictly necessary under parametric Bayesian
formalisms. Results under several noise levels and noise sources show that: (1)
the proposed method outperforms conventional wavelet methods that assume
coefficient independence, (2) it is similar to state-of-the-art methods that do
explicitly include these relations when the noise source is Gaussian, and (3)
it gives better numerical and visual performance when more complex, realistic
noise sources are considered. Therefore, the proposed machine learning approach
can be seen as a more flexible (model-free) alternative to the explicit
description of wavelet coefficient relations for image denoising.

of principal polynomials that capture the possibly nonlinear nature of the

modeling the directions of maximal variance by means of curves, instead of
straight lines. Contrarily to previous approaches, PPA reduces to performing
simple univariate regressions, which makes it computationally feasible and
robust. Moreover, PPA shows a number of interesting analytical properties.
First, PPA is a volume-preserving map, which in turn guarantees the existence
of the inverse. Second, such an inverse can be obtained in closed form.
Invertibility is an important advantage over other learning methods, because it
permits to understand the identified features in the input domain where the
data has physical meaning. Moreover, it allows to evaluate the performance of
dimensionality reduction in sensible (input-domain) units. Volume preservation
also allows an easy computation of information theoretic quantities, such as
the reduction in multi-information after the transform. Third, the analytical
nature of PPA leads to a clear geometrical interpretation of the manifold: it
allows the computation of Frenet-Serret frames (local features) and of
generalized curvatures at any point of the space. And fourth, the analytical
Jacobian allows the computation of the metric induced by the data, thus
generalizing the Mahalanobis distance. These properties are demonstrated
theoretically and illustrated experimentally. The performance of PPA is
evaluated in dimensionality and redundancy reduction, in both synthetic and
real datasets from the UCI repository.

representation by temporally pooling the features extracted at each frame. The
pooling methods that they adopt, however, usually completely or partially
neglect the dynamic information contained in the temporal domain, which may
undermine the discriminative power of the resulting video representation since
the video sequence order could unveil the evolution of a specific event or
action. To overcome this drawback and explore the importance of incorporating
the temporal order information, in this paper we propose a novel temporal
pooling approach to aggregate the frame-level features. Inspired by the
capacity of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in making use of the internal
structure of images for information abstraction, we propose to apply the
temporal convolution operation to the frame-level representations to extract
the dynamic information. However, directly implementing this idea on the
original high-dimensional feature would inevitably result in parameter
explosion.
  To tackle this problem, we view the temporal evolution of the feature value
at each feature dimension as a 1D signal and learn a unique convolutional
filter bank for each of these 1D signals. We conduct experiments on two
challenging video-based action recognition datasets, HMDB51 and UCF101; and
demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the conventional pooling
methods.

the sequential application of a univariate marginal Gaussianization transform
followed by an orthonormal transform. The proposed procedure looks for
differentiable transforms to a known PDF so that the unknown PDF can be
estimated at any point of the original domain. In particular, we aim at a zero
mean unit covariance Gaussian for convenience. RBIG is formally similar to
classical iterative Projection Pursuit (PP) algorithms. However, we show that,
unlike in PP methods, the particular class of rotations used has no special
qualitative relevance in this context, since looking for interestingness is not
a critical issue for PDF estimation. The key difference is that our approach
focuses on the univariate part (marginal Gaussianization) of the problem rather
than on the multivariate part (rotation). This difference implies that one may
select the most convenient rotation suited to each practical application. The
differentiability, invertibility and convergence of RBIG are theoretically and
experimentally analyzed. Relation to other methods, such as Radial
Gaussianization (RG), one-class support vector domain description (SVDD), and
deep neural networks (DNN) is also pointed out. The practical performance of
RBIG is successfully illustrated in a number of multidimensional problems such

widely-adopted procedure within digital humanities. The work described in this
paper extends this approach to the publication of gnomologia (anthologies of
wise sayings), which formed a widespread literary genre in many cultures of the
medieval Mediterranean. These texts are challenging because they were rarely
copied straightforwardly; rather, sayings were selected, reorganised, modified
or re-attributed between manuscripts, resulting in a highly interconnected
corpus for which a standard approach to digital publication is insufficient.
Focusing on Greek and Arabic collections, we address this challenge using
semantic web techniques to create an ecosystem of texts, relationships and
annotations, and consider a new model - organic, collaborative, interconnected,
and open-ended - of what constitutes an edition. This semantic web-based
approach allows scholars to add their own materials and annotations to the
network of information and to explore the conceptual networks that arise from
these interconnected sayings.

aspects: the system is nonlinear and adaptive to changing environments.
Conventional attempts to derive these features from statistics use separate
arguments for each aspect. The few statistical approaches that do consider both
phenomena simultaneously follow parametric formulations based on empirical
models. Therefore, it may be argued that the behavior does not come directly
from the color statistics but from the convenient functional form adopted. In
addition, many times the whole statistical analysis is based on simplified
databases that disregard relevant physical effects in the input signal, as for
instance by assuming flat Lambertian surfaces. Here we address the simultaneous
statistical explanation of (i) the nonlinear behavior of achromatic and
chromatic mechanisms in a fixed adaptation state, and (ii) the change of such
behavior. Both phenomena emerge directly from the samples through a single
data-driven method: the Sequential Principal Curves Analysis (SPCA) with local
metric. SPCA is a new manifold learning technique to derive a set of sensors
adapted to the manifold using different optimality criteria. A new database of
colorimetrically calibrated images of natural objects under these illuminants
was collected. The results obtained by applying SPCA show that the
psychophysical behavior on color discrimination thresholds, discount of the
illuminant and corresponding pairs in asymmetric color matching, emerge
directly from realistic data regularities assuming no a priori functional form.
These results provide stronger evidence for the hypothesis of a statistically
driven organization of color sensors. Moreover, the obtained results suggest
that color perception at this low abstraction level may be guided by an error
minimization strategy rather than by the information maximization principle.

it is possible to generate the B-mode by the Compton scattering in the case of
tensor mode of metric perturbation. For this reason, the ratio of tensor to
scalar modes of metric perturbation ($r\sim C_{Bl}/C_{El}$) is estimated by
comparing the B-mode power spectrum with the E-mode at least for small $l$. We
study the CMB polarization specially B-mode due to the weak interaction of
Cosmic Neutrino Background (CNB) and CMB, in addition to the Compton scattering
in both cases of scalar and tensor metric perturbations. It is shown that the
power spectrum $C_{Bl}$ of the B-mode polarization receives some contributions
from scalar and tensor modes, which have effects on the value of $r$-parameter.

evaluate quantitatively the mesh quality at which 3D scans should be exported,
and whether the object perception might be affected by its shading. We propose
using a paired-comparisons test based on psychophysics of perception to do that
evaluation. As psychophysics is not subject to opinion, skill level, mental
state, or economic situation it can be considered a quantitative way to measure
how people perceive the mesh quality. In particular, we propose using the
psychophysical measure for the comparison of four different levels of mesh
quality (1K, 5K, 10K and 20K triangles). We present two studies within
subjects: in one we investigate the quality perception variations of seeing an
object in a regular screen monitor against an stereoscopic Head Mounted Display

shading into quality perception. At each iteration of the pair-test comparisons
participants pick the mesh that they think had higher quality; by the end of
the experiment we compile a preference matrix. The matrix evidences the
correlation between real quality and assessed quality. Regarding the shading
mode, we find an interaction with quality and shading when the model has high
definition. Furthermore, we assess the subjective realism of the most/least
preferred scans using an Immersive Augmented Reality (IAR) video-see-through
setup. Results show higher levels of realism were perceived through the HMD
than when using a monitor, although the quality was similarly perceived in both

proved even if the noise only has moments up to an order strictly smaller than
its Blumenthal-Getoor index. In particular, this includes all stable noises
with index $\alpha<1+2/d$. Although we cannot show uniqueness, the constructed
solution is natural in the sense that it is the limit of the solutions to
approximative equations obtained by truncating the big jumps of the noise or by
restricting its support to a compact set in space. Under growth conditions on
the nonlinear term we can further derive moment estimates of the solution,
uniformly in space. Finally, the techniques are shown to apply to Volterra
equations with kernels bounded by generalized Gaussian densities. This
includes, for instance, a large class of uniformly parabolic stochastic PDEs.

understanding of neurobiological mechanisms, theoretical modeling of the
placebo response remains poorly developed. The most extensively accepted
theories are expectation and conditioning, involving both conscious and
unconscious information processing. However, it is not completely understood
how these mechanisms can shape the placebo response. We focus here on neural
processes which can account for key properties of the response to substance
intake. It is shown that placebo response can be conceptualized as a reaction
of a distributed neural system within the central nervous system. Such a
reaction represents an integrated component of the response to open substance
administration (or to substance intake) and is updated through ""unconditioned
stimulus (UCS) revaluation"" learning. The analysis leads to a theorem, which
proves the existence of two distinct quantities coded within the brain, these
are the expected or prediction outcome and the reactive response. We show that
the reactive response is updated automatically by implicit revaluation lerning,
while the expected outcome can also be modulated through conscious information
processing. Conceptualizing the response to substance intake in terms of UCS
revaluation learning leads to the theoretical formulation of a potential
neuropharmacological treatment for increasing unlimitedly the effectiveness of
a given drug.

on the basis of technological and transport simulations currently used in the

possible the operation of this field effect pixel detector. One alternative to
Deep Level introduction is the use of a quantum box, which is a hole
quantum-well and an electron barrier. In all of these cases the buried gate
modulates the drain-source current. This principle was formerly evaluated with
realistic simulations parameters and this shows that a measurable signal is
obtained for an energy deposition of a minimum-ionizing particle within a
limited silicon thickness. In this work a quantitative study of the response of
such a pixel to Minimum Ionizing Particles. The influence of some parameters
such as the thickness of the pixel and its lateral dimensions, on the operation
of the pixel is studied here using current available simulation tools, in
quantum mode when a narrow Ge layer is used as a buried gate. A bias sequence
is introduced here to separate the operation of the pixel in detection and
readout mode. The first frabrication technique introduced is deep impurity
implantation, followed by annealing. Recent work on quantum boxes and dots
opens the possibility to the use Ge boxes as a DTG.Ion implantation and
alternative methods such an epitaxial growth DTG can be reasonably considered.
If the related bottlenecks are overcome the pixel should be a good candidate
for high luminosity particle collider inner detectors, provides that its
potential radiation hardness is proven sufficient for these applications.

ask if such solutions satisfy the entropy condition. For a standard entropy

technologies that is fundamental for LISA-Pathfinder, an ESA mission whose
launch is planned for the end of September 2015. A purely drag-free object is
defined by the absence of all external forces other than gravity. This is not a
natural condition and thus requires a proper design of a spacecraft, whose core
is an object in free-fall, called test mass (TM). The purity of the drag-free
orbit depends on the spacecraft capability of protecting the TM from
disturbances, which indeed has limitations. According to a NASA study, such a
concept provides substantial economies for LEO satellites. At the same time, a
drag-free motion is required in many missions of fundamental physics. eLISA is
an ESA concept mission aimed at opening a new window to the universe, black
holes, and massive binary systems by means of gravitational waves.
LISA-Pathfinder is in charge of proving the eLISA concept. In this frame, the
system holding the TM during launch and releasing it in free-fall before the
science phase represents a single point of failure for the whole mission. This
thesis describes the phenomena, operations, issues, tests, activities, and
simulations linked to the release following a system engineering approach.
Experimental studies have been carried out to investigate this phenomenon in
conditions representative of the LISA-Pathfinder flight environment. The last
part of the thesis is dedicated to the preliminary design of the housing of the
TM in the frame of a low-cost mission conceived at Stanford (USA). The ambition
of this work is increasing the maturity of the technology needed in drag-free
projects and therefore provide a starting point for future fascinating and
challenging missions of this kind.

They established that a polynomial function of odd degree is not exceptional
APN provided the degree is not a Gold number $(2^k+1)$ or a Kasami-Welch number
$(2^{2k}-2^k+1)$. When the degree of the polynomial function is a Gold number,
several partial results have been obtained [1, 7, 8, 10, 17]. One of the
results in this article is a proof of the relatively primeness of the
multivariate APN polynomial conjecture, in the Gold degree case. This helps us
extend substantially previous results. We prove that Gold degree polynomials of

equation. We show that the dG moving mesh method is able to resolve sharp wave
fronts and wave speeds accurately for the optimal, arc-length and curvature
monitor functions. Numerical results reveal the efficiency of the proposed
moving mesh dG method for solving Burgers', Burgers'-Fisher and
Schl\""ogl(Nagumo) equations.
