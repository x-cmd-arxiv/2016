frequencies. The absorber consists of an array of split ring resonators (SRRs)
etched from a 100nm YBaCu3O7 (YBCO) film. A polyimide spacer layer and gold
ground plane are deposited above the SRRs, creating a reflecting perfect
absorber. Increasing either the temperature or incident electric field (E)
decreases the superconducting condensate density and corresponding kinetic
inductance of the SRRs. This alters the impedance matching in the metamaterial,
reducing the peak absorption. At low electric fields, the absorption was
optimized near 80% at T=10K and decreased to 20% at T=70K. For E=40kV/cm and
T=10K, the peak absorption was 70% decreasing to 40% at 200kV/cm, corresponding
to a modulation of 43%.

could be in the form of three species not yet de- tected in the interstellar
medium: H2S2, HS2, and S2 according to experimental simulations performed under
astrophysically relevant conditions. These S-S bonded molecules can be formed
by the energetic processing of H2S-bearing ice mantles on dust grains, and
subsequently desorb to the gas phase. The detection of these species could
partially solve the sulfur depletion problem, and would help to improve our
knowledge of the poorly known chemistry of sulfur in the interstellar medium.
To this purpose we performed dedicated ground-based observations toward the
low-mass warm core IRAS16293-2422. Observations in the submillimeter regime
were obtained with the APEX 12 m telescope during 15 hours of observation,
targeting a wide selection of the predicted rotational transitions of the three
molecules. The 1{\sigma} noise rms values were extracted in the spectral
regions where the targeted species should have been detected. These values were
a factor of 2-7 lower than those reached by previous observations toward the
same source, and allowed us to estimate a 1{\sigma} upper limit to their
molecular abundances of 8.1E-9 , 1.1E-8 , and 2.9E-7 relative to H2, for H2S2,
HS2, and S2, respectively. The upper limit abundances of the three molecules
containing the S2 unit are up to two orders of magnitude lower than the H2S
abundance in the source, and one order of magnitude lower than the expected
abundances from the experimental simulations using ice analogs. Subsequent
gas-phase chemistry after desorption could lower the abundances of the three

day ~4,000, mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission has been dominated by that from
shock-heated dust in the equatorial ring (ER). From 6,000 to 8,000 days after
the explosion, Spitzer observations included broadband photometry at 3.6 - 24
micron, and low and moderate resolution spectroscopy at 5 - 35 micron. Here we
present later Spitzer observations, through day 10,377, which include only the
broadband measurements at 3.6 and 4.5 micron. These data show that the 3.6 and
4.5 micron brightness has clearly begun to fade after day ~8,500, and no longer
tracks the X-ray emission as well as it did at earlier epochs. This can be
explained by the destruction of the dust in the ER on time scales shorter than
the cooling time for the shocked gas. We find that the evolution of the late
time IR emission is also similar to the now fading optical emission. We provide
the complete record of the IR emission lines, as seen by Spitzer prior to day
8,000. The past evolution of the gas as seen by the IR emission lines seems
largely consistent with the optical emission, although the IR [Fe II] and [Si
II] lines show different, peculiar velocity structures.

diseases which takes into account an imperfect vaccine combined with some other
mechanisms of control already studied in the literature. We begin by analyse
the basic model without controls. We prove the existence of two disease-free
equilibrium points and the possible existence of up to two endemic equilibrium
points (where the disease persists in the population). We show the existence of
a transcritical bifurcation and a possible saddle-node bifurcation and
explicitly derive threshold conditions for both, including defining the basic
reproduction number, R 0 , which determines whether the disease can persist in
the population or not. The epidemiological consequence of saddle-node
bifurcation (backward bifurcation) is that the classical requirement of having
the reproduction number less than unity, while necessary, is no longer
sufficient for disease elimination from the population. It is further shown
that in the absence of disease--induced death, the model does not exhibit this
phenomenon. We perform the sensitivity analysis to determine the model
robustness to parameter values. That is to help us to know the parameters that
are most influential in determining disease dynamics. The model is extended by
reformulating the model as an optimal control problem, with the use of five
time dependent controls, to assess the impact of vaccination combined with
treatment, individual protection and vector control strategies (killing adult
vectors, reduction of eggs and larvae). By using optimal control theory, we
establish optimal conditions under which the disease can be eradicated and we
examine the impact of a possible combined control tools on the disease
transmission. The Pontryagin's maximum principle is used to characterize the
optimal control. Numerical simulations, efficiency analysis and cost
effectiveness analysis show that, vaccination combined with other control
mechanisms, would reduce the spread of the disease appreciably, and this at low
cost.

leading astronomers of the day and he was the only southern hemisphere
representative on the hugely important Conference Internationale des Etoiles

stars. He was an initiator of the biggest multi-national and multi-observatory
project of the century, taking on the role of President of the International

Good Hope observatory from a rather run-down jobbing observatory of the
Admiralty to the best observatory in the Southern hemisphere. He acquired in

key element for the construction of Wigner functions for the planar phase space
(q,p) in R^2 is the Heisenberg-Weyl group, the corresponding group for the
cylindrical phase space (theta,p) in S^1 x R is the Euclidean group E(2) of the
plane and its unitary representations. Here the angle theta is replaced by the
pair (cos theta, sin theta) which corresponds uniquely to the points on the
unit circle. The main structural properties of the Wigner functions for the
planar and the cylindrical phase spaces are strikingly similar. A crucial role
plays the sinc function which provides the interpolation for the discontinuous
quantized angular momenta in terms of the continuous classical ones, in
accordance with the famous Whittaker cardinal function, well-known from
interpolation and sampling theories. The quantum mechanical marginal
distributions for angle (continuous) and angular momentum (discontinuous) are
as usual uniquely obtained by appropriate integrations of the (theta,p) Wigner
function. Among the examples discussed is an elementary system of simple ""cat""
states.

singularity and the Frobenius closure of parameter ideals in Noetherian rings
of positive characteristic. The paper consists of the following themes,
including many other topics. We prove that if every parameter ideal of a
Noetherian local ring of prime characteristic $p>0$ is Frobenius closed, then
it is $F$-injective. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the
injectivity of the Frobenius action on $H^i_{\fm}(R)$ for all $i \le
f_{\fm}(R)$, where $f_{\fm}(R)$ is the finiteness dimension of $R$. As
applications, we prove the following results. (a) If the ring is $F$-injective,
then every ideal generated by a filter regular sequence, whose length is equal
to the finiteness dimension of the ring, is Frobenius closed. It is a
generalization of a recent result of Ma and which is stated for generalized
Cohen-Macaulay local rings. (b) Let $(R,\fm,k)$ be a generalized Cohen-Macaulay
ring of characteristic $p>0$. If the Frobenius action is injective on the local
cohomology $H_{\fm}^i(R)$ for all $i < \dim R$, then $R$ is Buchsbaum. This
gives an answer to a question of Takagi. We consider the problem when the union
of two $F$-injective closed subschemes of a Noetherian $\mathbb{F}_p$-scheme is
$F$-injective. Using this idea, we construct an $F$-injective local ring $R$
such that $R$ has a parameter ideal that is not Frobenius closed. This result
adds a new member to the family of $F$-singularities. We give the first
ideal-theoretic characterization of $F$-injectivity in terms the Frobenius
closure and the limit closure. We also give an answer to the question about
when the Frobenius action on the top local cohomology is injective.

ordered nanopatterns on the surfaces of different materials. To date, most
theoretical studies of this process have focused on systems which become
amorphous under irradiation, e.g. semiconductors at room temperature. Thus, in
spite of the large amount of experimental work on metals, or more recently on
semiconductors at high temperatures, such experimental contexts have received
relatively little theoretical attention. These systems are characterized by
transport mechanisms, e.g. surface diffusion, which are anisotropic as a
reflection of the crystalline structure not being overruled by the irradiation.
Here, we generalize a previous continuum theory of IBS at normal incidence, in
order to account for anisotropic surface diffusion. We explore systematically
our generalized model in order to understand the role of anisotropy in the
space ordering properties of the resulting patterns. In particular, we derive a
height equation which predicts morphological transitions among hexagonal and
rectangular patterns as a function of system parameters and employ an angular
correlation function to assess these pattern symmetries. By suitably choosing
experimental conditions, it is found that one might be able to experimentally
control the type of order displayed by the patterns produced.

month period. Our two new Chandra observations show a factor of $\sim$10
increase in the 0.35-8 keV X-ray flux, from $\sim$4$\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$
to $4\times10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in $\sim$6 months, and the X-ray spectrum is
consistent in both observations with a power law photon index of $\Gamma\sim0$.
We find evidence of X-ray spectral state changes: when SN 2010da is in a
high-luminosity state, the X-ray spectrum is harder ($\Gamma\sim0$) compared to
the low-luminosity state ($\Gamma\sim1.2\pm0.8$). Using our Hubble
observations, we fit the color magnitude diagram of the coeval stellar
population to estimate a time since formation of the SN 2010da progenitor
system of $\lesssim$5 Myr. Our observations are consistent with SN 2010da being
a high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) composed of a neutron star and a luminous blue
variable-like companion, although we cannot rule out the possibility that SN
2010da is an unusually X-ray bright massive star. The $\lesssim$5 Myr age is
consistent with the theoretically predicted delay time between the formation of
a massive binary and the onset of the HMXB phase. It is possible that the
initial 2010 outburst marked the beginning of X-ray production in the system,
making SN 2010da possibly the first massive progenitor binary ever observed to
evolve into an HMXB.

talk in the research community, yet in practice, menu based speech solutions
thrive. Typically in a menu based speech solution the user is required to
respond by speaking from a closed set of words when prompted by the system. A
sequence of human speech response to the IVR prompts results in the completion
of a transaction. A transaction is deemed successful if the speech solution can
correctly recognize all the spoken utterances of the user whenever prompted by
the system. The usual mechanism to evaluate the performance of a speech
solution is to do an extensive test of the system by putting it to actual
people use and then evaluating the performance by analyzing the logs for
successful transactions. This kind of evaluation could lead to dissatisfied
test users especially if the performance of the system were to result in a poor
transaction completion rate. To negate this the Wizard of Oz approach is
adopted during evaluation of a speech system. Overall this kind of evaluations
is an expensive proposition both in terms of time and cost. In this paper, we
propose a method to evaluate the performance of a speech solution without
actually putting it to people use. We first describe the methodology and then
show experimentally that this can be used to identify the performance
bottlenecks of the speech solution even before the system is actually used thus
saving evaluation time and expenses.

possible to estimate $\alpha$ when the number of evaluations of $f$ is very

subset simulation (BSS). A key idea, as in the subset simulation algorithm, is
to estimate the probabilities of a sequence of excursion sets of $f$ above
intermediate thresholds, using a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approach. A
Gaussian process prior on $f$ is used to define the sequence of densities
targeted by the SMC algorithm, and drive the selection of evaluation points of
$f$ to estimate the intermediate probabilities. Adaptive procedures are
proposed to determine the intermediate thresholds and the number of evaluations

illustrate that BSS achieves significant savings in the number of function

differentiable three dimensional manifold which carries much analytic
information. It is an interesting question to ask whether, under suitable
analytic and topological conditions, the geometric genus (or other analytic
invariants) can be recovered from the link. The Casson invariant conjecture
predicts that p_g can be identified using the Casson invariant in the case when
(X,0) is a complete intersection and M has trivial first homology with integral
coefficients. The Seiberg-Witten invariant conjecture predicts that the
geometric genus of a Gorenstein singularity, whose link has trivial first
homology with rational coefficients, can be calculated as a normalized
Seiberg-Witten invariant of the link. The first conjecture is still open, but
counterexamples have been found for the second one. We prove here the
Seiberg-Witten invariant conjecture for hypersurface singularities given by a
function with Newton nondegenerate principal part. We provide a theory of
computation sequences and of the way they bound the geometric genus. Newton
nondegenerate singularities can be resolved explicitly by Oka's algorithm, and
we exploit the combinatorial interplay between the resolution graph and the
Newton diagram to show that in each step of the computation sequence we
construct, the given bound is sharp. Our method recovers the geometric genus of
(X,0) explicitly from the link, assuming that (X,0) is indeed Newton
nondegenerate with a rational homology sphere link. Assuming some additional
information about the Newton diagram, we recover part of the spectrum, as well
as the Poincar\'e series associated with the Newton filtration. Finally, we
show that the normalized Seiberg-Witten invariant associated with the canonical
spin^c structure on the link coincides with our identification of the geometric
genus.

search. We present tensor classification as such a technique for smoothed
particle hydrodynamics (SPH). These methods have already been used to great
effect in N-Body cosmological simulations, which require smoothing defined as
an input free parameter. We show that tensor classification successfully
identifies a wide range of structures in SPH density fields using its native
smoothing, removing a free parameter from the analysis and preventing the need
for tesselation of the density field, as required by some classification
algorithms. As examples, we show that tensor classification using the tidal
tensor and the velocity shear tensor successfully identifies filaments, shells
and sheet structures in giant molecular cloud simulations, as well as spiral
arms in discs. The relationship between structures identified using different
tensors illustrates how different forces compete and co-operate to produce the
observed density field. We therefore advocate the use of multiple tensors to
classify structure in SPH simulations, to shed light on the interplay of
multiple physical processes.

assigned to each systematic model and use the information from all tested

wavelength position over the course of the observations and find that
spectroscopic wavelength shifts $\delta_\lambda(\lambda)$, best describe the
associated systematic in the spectroscopic lightcurves for most targets, while
fast scan rate observations of bright targets require an additional level of

classical mechanics is of continuing interest. Practically it is of importance
for the interpretation of multi-particle coincidence measurements performed at
macroscopic distances from a microscopic reaction zone. Here we prove the
generalized iimaging theorem which shows that the spatial wave function of any
multi-particle quantum system, propagating over distances and times large on an
atomic scale but still microscopic, and subject to deterministic external
fields and particle interactions, becomes proportional to the initial momentum
wave function where the position and momentum coordinates define a classical
trajectory. Currently, the quantum to classical transition is considered to
occur via decoherence caused by stochastic interaction with an environment. The
imaging theorem arises from unitary Schroedinger propagation and so is valid
without any environmental interaction. It implies that a simultaneous
measurement of both position and momentum will define a unique classical

use the kinematics of starlight up to 4 effective radii (R$_e$) as diagnostics
of galaxy inner and outer regions, and assign each galaxy to one of six Naab et

  The majority of our galaxies (14/24) have kinematic characteristics that
indicate an assembly history dominated by gradual gas dissipation and accretion
of many gas-rich minor mergers. Three galaxies, all S0s, indicate that they
have experienced gas-rich major mergers in their more recent past. One
additional elliptical galaxy is tentatively associated with a gas-rich merger
which results in a remnant galaxy with low angular momentum. Pathways dominated
by gas-poor (major or minor) mergers dominate the mass growth of six galaxies.
Most SLUGGS galaxies appear to have grown in mass (and size) via the accretion
of stars and gas from minor mergers, with late major mergers playing a much
smaller role.

theoretically expected value for the velocity dispersion if a region were in
virial equilibrium, $\sigma_{\rm vir}$ and thus assess the virial state
($\sigma / \sigma_{\rm vir}$) of these systems. We find that in regions that
are initially subvirial, or in global virial equilibrium but subvirial on local
scales, the system relaxes to virial equilibrium within several million years,
or roughly 25 - 50 crossing times, according to the measured virial ratio.
However, the measured velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, appears to be a bad
diagnostic of the current virial state of these systems as it suggests that
they become supervirial when compared to the velocity dispersion estimated from
the virial mass, $\sigma_{\rm vir}$. We suggest that this discrepancy is caused
by the fact that the regions are never fully relaxed, and that the early
non-equilibrium evolution is imprinted in the one-dimensional velocity
dispersion at these early epochs. If measured early enough ($<$2 Myr in our
simulations, or $\sim$20 crossing times), the velocity dispersion can be used
to determine whether a region was highly supervirial at birth without the risk
of degeneracy. We show that combining $\sigma$, or the ratio of $\sigma$ to the
interquartile range (IQR) dispersion, with measures of spatial structure,
places stronger constraints on the dynamical history of a region than using the

that emission from a magnetar central engine cannot be solely responsible for
powering an LGRB-SN. While the early AG-dominated phase can be well described
with our model, the predicted SN luminosity is underluminous by a factor of
$3-17$. We use this as compelling evidence that additional sources of heating
must be present to power an LGRB-SN, which we argue must be radioactive
heating. Our self-consistent modelling approach was able to successfully
describe all phases of ULGRB 111209A / SN 2011kl, from the early afterglow to
the later SN, where we determined for the magnetar central engine a magnetic
field strength of $1.1-1.3\times10^{15}$ G, an initial spin period of
$11.5-13.0$ ms, a spin-down time of $4.8-6.5$ d, and an initial energy of
$1.2-1.6\times10^{50}$ erg. These values are entirely consistent with those
determined by other authors. The luminosity of a magnetar-powered SN is
directly related to how long the central engine is active, where central
engines with longer durations give rise to brighter SNe. The spin-down
timescales of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are of order months to years,
which provides a natural explanation as to why SN 2011kl was less luminous than
SLSNe that are also powered by emission from magnetar central engines.

early (z>6) Universe. We suggest that the growth of SMBHs above a few 10^{10}
M_sun is prevented by small-scale accretion physics, independent of the
properties of their host galaxies or of cosmology. Growing more massive BHs
requires a gas supply rate from galactic scales onto a nuclear region as high
as >10^3 M_sun/yr. At such a high accretion rate, most of the gas converts to
stars at large radii (~10-100 pc), well before reaching the BH. We adopt a
simple model (Thompson et al. 2005) for a star-forming accretion disk, and find
that the accretion rate in the sub-pc nuclear region is reduced to the smaller
value of at most a few M_sun/yr. This prevents SMBHs from growing above
~10^{11} M_sun in the age of the Universe. Furthermore, once a SMBH reaches a
sufficiently high mass, this rate falls below the critical value at which the
accretion flow becomes advection dominated. Once this transition occurs, BH
feeding can be suppressed by strong outflows and jets from hot gas near the BH.
We find that the maximum SMBH mass, given by this transition, is between
M_{BH,max} ~ (1-6) * 10^{10} M_sun, depending primarily on the efficiency of
angular momentum transfer inside the galactic disk, and not on other properties
of the host galaxy.

For this purpose we employ a very detailed observationally motivated potential

able to raise an important percentage of open clusters (about one-sixth of the
total employed in our simulations, depending on the structural parameters of
the arms) above the Galactic plane to heights beyond 200 pc, producing a
bulge-shaped structure toward the center of the Galaxy. Contrary to what was
expected, the spiral arms produce a much greater vertical effect on the
clusters than the bar, both in quantity and height; this is due to the sharper
concentration of the mass on the spiral arms, when compared to the bar. When a
bar and spiral arms are included, spiral arms are still capable of raising an
important percentage of the simulated open clusters through chaotic diffusion
(as tested from classification analysis of the resultant high-z orbits), but
the bar seems to restrain them, diminishing the elevation above the plane by a
factor of about two.

in galaxies with masses $\lesssim 10^{10}M_\odot$) or a Massive Black Hole
(MBH, common in galaxies with masses $\gtrsim 10^{12}M_\odot$). In the
intermediate mass range, some nuclei host both a NSC and a MBH. In this paper,
we explore scaling relations between NSC mass (${\cal M}_{\rm NSC}$) and host
galaxy total stellar mass (${\cal M}_{\star,\rm gal}$) using a large sample of
NSCs in late- and early-type galaxies, including a number of NSCs harboring a
MBH. Such scaling relations reflect the underlying physical mechanisms driving
the formation and (co)evolution of these central massive objects. We find
$\sim\!1.5\sigma$ significant differences between NSCs in late- and early-type
galaxies in the slopes and offsets of the relations $r_{\rm eff,NSC}$--${\cal
M}_{\rm NSC}$, $r_{\rm eff, NSC}$--${\cal M}_{\star,\rm gal}$ and ${\cal
M}_{\rm NSC}$--${\cal M}_{\star,\rm gal}$, in the sense that $i)$ NSCs in
late-types are more compact at fixed ${\cal M}_{\rm NSC}$ and ${\cal

to the ${\cal M}_{\rm BH}$--${\cal M}_{\star,\rm bulge}$ relation. We discuss
these results in the context of the (possibly ongoing) evolution of NSCs,
depending on host galaxy type. For NSCs with a MBH, we illustrate the possible
influence of a MBH on its host NSC, by considering the ratio between the radius
of the MBH sphere of influence and $r_{\rm eff, NSC}$. NSCs harbouring a
sufficiently massive black hole are likely to exhibit surface brightness

in our example, for stellar angular size up to 1.1\,mas. This would allow
probing the vicinity of Sun-like stars located beyond 4.4\,pc, therefore fully
retiring this concern. If the fraction of stars with Earth-like planets is
$\eta_{\Earth}=0.1$, with 18\% throughput, assuming a perfect, stable wavefront

existing mask technologies and compatible with segmented apertures, and that
can provide contrast compatible with detecting and studying Earth-like planets

nature and energy content of gas fluctuations in the Perseus core by probing
statistical properties of emissivity fluctuations imprinted in the soft- and
hard-band X-ray images. About 80 per cent of the total variance of
perturbations on ~ 8-70 kpc scales in the inner region have an isobaric nature,
i.e., are consistent with slow displacements of the gas in pressure equilibrium
with ambient medium. Observed variance translates to the ratio of non-thermal
to thermal energy of ~13 per cent. In the region dominated by weak ""ripples"",
about half of the total variance is also associated with isobaric perturbations
on scales ~ a few tens of kpc. If these isobaric perturbations are induced by
buoyantly rising bubbles, then these results suggest that most of the
AGN-injected energy should first go into bubbles rather than into shocks. Using
simulations of a shock propagating through the Perseus atmosphere, we found
that models reproducing the observed features of a central shock have more than
50 per cent of the AGN-injected energy associated with the bubble enthalpy and
only about 20 per cent is carried away with the shock. Such energy partition is
consistent with the AGN-feedback model, mediated by bubbles of relativistic
plasma, and supports the importance of turbulence in the balance between gas
heating and radiative cooling.

observations probing the quasar winds. The HST images reveal bright merger
signatures in about half the galaxies; a significantly higher fraction than in

bulge-dominated, with masses close to M*, but belong to < 30% of elliptical
galaxies that are highly star-forming at z ~ 0.5. Ionized gas signatures are
uncorrelated with faint stellar disks (if present), confirming that the ionized

simulations include standard $\Lambda$-cold dark matter (CDM) models, and
additional runs with truncated power spectra, consistent with a thermal warm
dark matter (WDM) scenario. We find that the mass profiles of CDM and WDM halos
are self-similar and well approximated by the Einasto profile. The $c({\rm
M},z)$ relation of CDM halos is monotonic: concentrations decrease with
increasing virial mass at fixed redshift, and decrease with increasing redshift
at fixed mass. The mass accretion histories (MAHs) of CDM halos are also
scale-free, and can be used to infer concentrations directly. These results do
not apply to WDM halos: their MAHs are not scale-free because of the
characteristic scale imposed by the power-spectrum suppression. Further, the
WDM $c({\rm M},z)$ relation is non-monotonic: concentrations peak at a mass
scale dictated by the truncation scale, and decrease at higher and lower
masses. We show that the assembly history of a halo can still be used to infer
its concentration, provided that the total mass of its progenitors is
considered (the ""collapsed mass history""; CMH), rather than just that of its
main ancestor. This exploits the scale-free nature of CMHs to derive a simple
scaling that reproduces the mass-concentration-redshift relation of both CDM
and WDM halos over a vast range of halo masses and redshifts. Our model
therefore provides a robust account of the mass, redshift, cosmology and power
spectrum dependence of dark matter halo concentrations.

rates of events that produce rapidly-spinning magnetars remain very uncertain.
The low ejecta mass also helps limit the high-energy neutrino background
associated with this scenario to be below current IceCube constraints over most

Hz on 2003 Dec 13 (frequency ratio of 1.59$\pm$0.09). The global significance
of the 0.29 Hz feature considering all frequencies between 0.1 and 4 Hz is $>$
3.5 $\sigma$. The significance of the 0.46$\pm$0.02 Hz QPO is $>$ 3.5$\sigma$
for a search at 2/3 and 3/2 of 0.29 Hz. We also detect lower frequency QPOs
(32.9$\pm$2.6 and 79.7$\pm$1.2 mHz). All the QPOs are super-imposed on a
continuum consisting of flat-topped, band-limited noise, breaking into a
power-law at a frequency of 16$\pm$3 mHz and white noise at $\gtrsim$ 0.1 Hz.
NGC1313X-1's PDS is analogous to stellar-mass black holes' (StMBHs) PDS in the
so-called steep power-law state, but with the respective frequencies (both QPOs
and break frequencies) scaled down by a factor of $\sim$ 1000. Using the
inverse mass-to-high-frequency QPO scaling of StMBHs, we estimate NGC1313X-1's
black hole mass to be 5000$\pm$1300 $M_{\odot}$, consistent with an inference
from the scaling of the break frequency. However, the implied Eddington ratio,
L$_{Edd}$ $>$ 0.03$\pm$0.01, is significantly lower compared to StMBHs in the
steep power-law state (L$_{Edd}$ $\gtrsim$ 0.2).

K-selected galaxy sample at 0.5<z<2.0. Based on similarities between the
UV-to-NIR spectral energy distributions, we classify galaxies into 32 spectral
types. The different types span a wide range in evolutionary phases, and thus
-- in combination with available CANDELS/F160W imaging -- are ideal to study
the structural evolution of galaxies. Effective radii (R_e) and Sersic
parameters (n) have been measured for 572 individual galaxies, and for each
type, we determine R_e at fixed stellar mass by correcting for the mass-size
relation. We use the rest-frame U-V vs. V-J diagram to investigate evolutionary
trends. When moving into the direction perpendicular to the star-forming
sequence, in which we see the Halpha equivalent width and the specific star
formation rate (sSFR) decrease, we find a decrease in R_e and an increase in n.
On the quiescent sequence we find an opposite trend, with older redder galaxies
being larger. When splitting the sample into redshift bins, we find that young
post-starburst galaxies are most prevalent at z>1.5 and significantly smaller
than all other galaxy types at the same redshift. This result suggests that the
suppression of star formation may be associated with significant structural
evolution at z>1.5. At z<1, galaxy types with intermediate sSFRs
(10^{-11.5}-10^{-10.5} yr^-1) do not have post-starburst SED shapes. These
galaxies have similar sizes as older quiescent galaxies, implying that they can
passively evolve onto the quiescent sequence, without increasing the average
size of the quiescent galaxy population.

subset of our bright SCUBA-2 sample as a training set, along with the deep
optical-near-infrared data available in this field, we develop a novel
technique, Optical-IR Triple Color (OIRTC), using $z-K$, $K-[3.6]$,
$[3.6]-[4.5]$ colors to select the candidate submillimeter galaxy (SMG)
counterparts. By combining radio identification and the OIRTC technique, we
find counterpart candidates for 80% of the Class = 1 $\geq4\,\sigma$ SCUBA-2
sample, defined as those that are covered by both radio and OIR imaging and the
base sample for our scientific analyses. Based on the ALMA training set, we
expect the accuracy of these identifications to be $82\pm20$%, with a
completeness of $69\pm16$%, essentially as accurate as the traditional
$p$-value technique but with higher completeness. We find that the fraction of
SCUBA-2 sources having candidate counterparts is lower for fainter 850$\mu$m

$S_{850}\gtrsim 1$ mJy across the whole ALMA beam, the fraction with multiple
counterparts is likely to be $>40$% for SCUBA-2 sources at $S_{850} \gtrsim 4$
mJy. We find that the photometric redshift distribution for the SMGs is well
fit by a lognormal distribution, with a median redshift of $z=2.3\pm0.1$. After
accounting for the sources without any radio and/or OIRTC counterpart, we
estimate the median redshift to be $z=2.6\pm0.1$ for SMGs with $S_{850} >1$

astrophysical phenomena, and yet ages can be difficult to determine. As they
become older, stars lose mass and angular momentum, resulting in an observed
slowdown in surface rotation. The technique of 'gyrochronology' uses the
rotation period of a star to calculate its age. However, stars of known age
must be used for calibration, and, until recently, the approach was untested
for old stars (older than 1 gigayear, Gyr). Rotation periods are now known for
stars in an open cluster of intermediate age (NGC 6819; 2.5 Gyr old), and for
old field stars whose ages have been determined with asteroseismology. The data
for the cluster agree with previous period-age relations, but these relations
fail to describe the asteroseismic sample. Here we report stellar evolutionary
modelling, and confirm the presence of unexpectedly rapid rotation in stars
that are more evolved than the Sun. We demonstrate that models that incorporate
dramatically weakened magnetic braking for old stars can---unlike existing
models---reproduce both the asteroseismic and the cluster data. Our findings
might suggest a fundamental change in the nature of ageing stellar dynamos,
with the Sun being close to the critical transition to much weaker magnetized
winds. This weakened braking limits the diagnostic power of gyrochronology for
those stars that are more than halfway through their main-sequence lifetimes.

Semi-Metal (DSM). The low-energy description of the most basic 2D DSM model
consists of two Dirac cones at positions $\pm\mathbf{k}_0$ in momentum space.
The local stability of the Dirac cones is guaranteed by a composite symmetry
$Z_2^{\mathcal{TI}}$, where $\mathcal{T}$ is time-reversal and $\mathcal{I}$ is
inversion. This model also exhibits interesting time-reversal and inversion
symmetry breaking electromagnetic responses. In this work we construct a
bosonic version by replacing each Dirac cone with a copy of the $O(4)$
Nonlinear Sigma Model (NLSM) with topological theta term and theta angle
$\theta=\pm \pi$. One copy of this NLSM also describes the gapless surface
termination of the 3D Bosonic Topological Insulator (BTI). We compute the
time-reversal and inversion symmetry breaking electromagnetic responses for our
model and show that they are twice the value one gets in the DSM case matching
what one might expect from, for example, a bosonic Chern insulator. We also
investigate the stability of the BSM model and find that the composite
$Z_2^{\mathcal{TI}}$ symmetry again plays an important role. Along the way we
clarify many aspects of the surface theory of the BTI including the
electromagnetic response, the charges and statistics of vortex excitations, and
the stability to symmetry-allowed perturbations. We briefly comment on the
relation between the various descriptions of the $O(4)$ NLSM with $\theta=\pi$

four massless fermions) and the recently proposed dual description of the BTI
surface in terms of $2+1$ dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics with two flavors

adapt the Lewkowycz-Maldacena procedure to find the holographic entanglement
entropy. The key observation, which to our knowledge is not very well
appreciated, is that asymptotic boundary conditions play an essential role on
extending the replica trick to the bulk. For non AAdS, we expect the following
three main modifications: (1) the expansion near the special surface has to be
compatible with the asymptotic expansion; (2) periodic conditions are imposed
to coordinates on the phase space with diagonalized symplectic structure, not
to all fields appearing in the action; (3) evaluating the entanglement
functional using the boundary term method amounts to evaluating the
presymplectic structure at the special surface, where some additional exact
form may contribute. An explicit calculation is carried out for
three-dimensional warped anti-de Sitter spacetime (WAdS3) in a consistent
truncation of string theory, the so-called S-dual dipole theory. It turns out
that the generalized gravitational entropy in WAdS3 is captured by the least
action of a charged particle in WAdS3 space, or equivalently, by the geodesic
length in an auxiliary AdS3. Consequently, the bulk calculation agrees with the
CFT results, providing another piece of evidence for the WAdS3/CFT2

making it an ideal candidate to investigate the origin of these lines. To this
end, we present simulations of multiple mass transfer-nova cycles in RS Oph. We
find that the quiescent mass transfer produces a dense, equatorial outflow,
i.e., concentrated towards the binary orbital plane, and an accretion disc
forms around the white dwarf. The interaction of a spherical nova outburst with
these aspherical circumstellar structures produces a bipolar outflow, similar
to that seen in HST imaging of the 2006 outburst. In order to produce an
ionization structure that is consistent with observations, a mass-loss rate of
$5 \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ from the red giant is
required. The simulations also produce a polar accretion flow, which may
explain the broad wings of the quiescent H {\alpha} line and hard X-rays. By
comparing simulated absorption line profiles to observations of the 2006
outburst, we are able to determine which components arise in the wind and which
are due to the novae. We explore the possible behaviour of absorption line
profiles as they may appear should a supernova occur in a system like RS Oph.
Our models show similarities to supernovae like SN 2006X, but require a high

weigh the central compact object. We find that although NGC 5408 X-1's X-rays
are variable on a timescale of a few hundred seconds (RMS of 9.0$\pm$0.5%), the
optical emission does not show any statistically significant variations. We set
a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the RMS optical variability of 3.3%. The ratio of
the X-ray to the optical variability is an indicator of X-ray reprocessing
efficiency. In X-ray binaries, this ratio is roughly 5. Assuming a similar
ratio for NGC 5408 X-1, the expected RMS optical variability is $\approx$2%

the pc-scale dust and ionized gas maps of Circinus constructed using

subtraction process is non-trivial, and existing solutions suffer from a
variety of problems. Starting from basic statistical principles, we develop the
optimal statistic for transient detection, flux measurement and any
image-difference hypothesis testing. We derive a closed-form statistic that:
(i) Is mathematically proven to be the optimal transient detection statistic in
the limit of background-dominated noise; (ii) Is numerically stable; (iii) For
accurately registered, adequately sampled images, does not leave subtraction or
deconvolution artifacts; (iv) Allows automatic transient detection to the
theoretical sensitivity limit by providing credible detection significance; (v)
Has uncorrelated white noise; (vi) Is a sufficient statistic for any further
statistical test on the difference image, and in particular, allows to
distinguish particle hits and other image artifacts from real transients; (vii)
Is symmetric to the exchange of the new and reference images; (viii) Is at
least an order of magnitude faster to compute than some popular methods; and
(ix) Is straightforward to implement. Furthermore, we present extensions of
this method that make it resilient to registration errors, color-refraction
errors, and any noise source that can be modelled. In addition, we show that
the optimal way to prepare a reference image is the proper image coaddition
presented in Zackay \& Ofek (2015b). We demonstrate this method on simulated

block model from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph with high probability. We
also rely on bounds on certain functions of doubly stochastic matrices due to
Achlioptas and Naor; indeed, our lower bound on $d_c$ is the second moment
lower bound on the $k$-colorability threshold for random graphs with a certain

meet the demand for rapid GW parameter estimation is to trade off accuracy for
speed, using waveform models with simplified treatment of the compact objects'
spin. We report on the systematic errors in GW parameter estimation suffered
when using different spin approximations to recover generic signals. Component
mass measurements can be biased by $>5\sigma$ using simple-precession waveforms
and in excess of $20\sigma$ when non-spinning templates are employed. This
suggests that electromagnetic observing campaigns should not take a strict
approach to selecting which LIGO/Virgo candidates warrant follow-up
observations based on low-latency mass estimates. For sky localization, we find
searched areas are up to a factor of ${\sim}$2 larger for non-spinning
analyses, and are systematically larger for any of the simplified waveforms
considered in our analysis. Distance biases for the non-precessing waveforms
can be in excess of 100\% and are largest when the spin angular momenta are in
the orbital plane of the binary. We confirm that spin-aligned waveforms should
be used for low-latency parameter estimation at the minimum. Including simple
precession, though more computationally costly, mitigates biases except for
signals with extreme precession effects. Our results shine a spotlight on the
critical need for development of computationally inexpensive precessing
waveforms and/or massively parallel algorithms for parameter estimation.

the star formation rates of ~700 star forming complexes in 46 nearby
interacting galaxy pairs with those of regions in 39 normal spiral galaxies.
The interacting galaxies have proportionally more regions with high star
formation rates than the spirals. The most extreme regions in the interacting
systems lie at the intersections of spiral/tidal structures, where gas is
expected to pile up and trigger star formation. Published Hubble Telescope
images show unusually large and luminous star clusters in the highest
luminosity regions. The star formation rates of the clumps correlate with
measures of the dust attenuation, consistent with the idea that regions with
more interstellar gas have more star formation. For the clumps with the highest
star formation rates, the apparent dust attenuation is consistent with the
Calzetti starburst dust attenuation law. This suggests that the high luminosity
regions are dominated by a central group of young stars surrounded by a shell
of clumpy interstellar gas. In contrast, the lower luminosity clumps are bright
in the UV relative to H-alpha, suggesting either a high differential
attenuation between the ionized gas and the stars, or a post-starburst
population bright in the UV but faded in H-alpha. The fraction of the global
light of the galaxies in the clumps is higher on average for the interacting
galaxies than for the spirals. Thus the star forming regions in interacting
galaxies are more luminous, dustier, or younger on average.

matter field is intrinsically non-local due to the presence of the tidal force.
This complicates the theoretical investigation of the non-linear evolution of
various cosmic objects, e.g. dark matter halos, in the context of Lagrangian
fluid dynamics, since a fluid parcel with given initial density and shape may
evolve differently depending on their environments. In this paper, we provide a
statistical solution that could decouple this environmental dependence. After
deriving the probability distribution evolution equation of the matter field,
our method produces a set of closed ordinary differential equations whose
solution is uniquely determined by the initial condition of the fluid element.
Mathematically, it corresponds to the projected characteristic curve of the
transport equation of the density-weighted probability density function (PDF).
Consequently it is guaranteed that the one-point PDF would be preserved by
evolving these local, yet non-linear, curves with the same set of initial data
as the real system. Physically, these trajectories describe the mean evolution
averaged over all environments by substituting the tidal tensor with its
conditional average. For Gaussian distributed dynamical variables, this mean
tidal tensor is simply proportional to the velocity shear tensor, and the
dynamical system would recover the prediction of Zel'dovich approximation (ZA)
with the further assumption of the linearized continuity equation. For Weakly
non-Gaussian field, the averaged tidal tensor could be expanded perturbatively
as a function of all relevant dynamical variables whose coefficients are
determined by the statistics of the field.

Lasinio action, whereas the four-fermion operators, arising from a different
sector, are local. In order to illustrate the method, we investigate a simple
toy model with a global $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\to SU(2)_V$ symmetry breaking,
and a four-fermion operator breaking $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ but preserving
$SU(2)_V$. In the particle spectrum we only include the pseudoscalar isospin
triplet, that is the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with chiral
symmetry breaking, and the lightest scalar singlet. After checking that the
nonlocal model successfully accounts for the experimental results in
two-flavour QCD, we investigate the mass spectrum as a function of the
four-fermion coupling. For our specific choice of four-fermion operator, we
find that the mass of the pseudoscalar triplet grows, whereas the mass of the
lightest scalar singlet is approximately unaffected, as the four-fermion
coupling grows. We argue that these results can be directly tested on the

quantitative modeling research has identified artifact interactions, where a
design change in one component influences others, as an important determinant
of improvement rates. The models predict that improvement rate for a domain is
proportional to the inverse of the domain interaction parameter. However, no
empirical research has previously studied and tested the dependence of
improvement rates on artifact interactions. A challenge to testing the
dependence is that any method for measuring interactions has to be applicable
to a wide variety of technologies. Here we propose a patent-based method that
is both technology domain-agnostic and less costly than alternative methods. We
use textual content from patent sets in 27 domains to find the influence of
interactions on improvement rates. Qualitative analysis identified six specific
keywords that signal artifact interactions. Patent sets from each domain were
then examined to determine the total count of these 6 keywords in each domain,
giving an estimate of artifact interactions in each domain. It is found that
improvement rates are positively correlated with the inverse of the total count
of keywords with correlation coefficient of +0.56 with a p-value of 0.002. The
empirical results agree with model predictions and support the suggestion that
domains with higher number of artifacts interactions (higher complexity) will
improve at a slower pace.

are used to improve the sensitivity of a measurement. For enhanced mechanical
displacement sensing, squeezed states of light have been shown to reduce the
photon counting noise that limits the measurement noise floor. It has long been
predicted, however, that suppressing the noise floor with squeezed light should
produce an unavoidable increase in radiation pressure noise that drives the
mechanical system. Such nonclassical radiation pressure forces have thus far
been hidden by insufficient measurement strengths and residual thermal
mechanical motion. Since the ultimate measurement sensitivity relies on the
delicate balance between these two noise sources, the limits of the quantum
enhancement have not been observed. Using a microwave cavity optomechanical
system, we observe the nonclassical radiation pressure noise that necessarily
accompanies any quantum enhancement of the measurement precision. By varying
both the magnitude and phase of the squeezing, we optimize the fundamental
trade-off between mechanical imprecision and backaction noise in accordance
with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As the strength of the measurement
is further increased, radiation pressure forces eventually dominate the
mechanical motion. In this regime, the optomechanical interaction can be
exploited as an efficient quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of the
amplitude fluctuations of the light field. By overwhelming mechanical thermal
noise with radiation pressure by two orders of magnitude, we demonstrate a
mechanically-mediated measurement of the squeezing with an effective homodyne
efficiency of 94%. Thus, with strong radiation pressures forces, mechanical
motion enhances the measurement of nonclassical light, just as nonclassical
light enhances the measurement of the motion.

they undergo a random constriction process in which the particle constriction
probability P is a function of the stress exerted on the particle by its
neighbors. We find that when P favors tensile stress, constricted particles
tend to form chain-like structures. In contrast, constricted particles tend to
form compact clusters when P favors compression. A remarkable similarity of
constricted-particle chains and CCCs observed in vivo provides indirect
evidence that tensile-stress feedback coordinates the apical constriction
activity. We expect that our particle-based AGF model will be useful in

promising route to measuring the amplitude of matter clustering and testing
modified gravity theories of cosmic acceleration. Halo occupation distribution
(HOD) modeling can extend the approach down to nonlinear scales, but galaxy
assembly bias could introduce systematic errors by causing the HOD to vary with
large scale environment at fixed halo mass. We investigate this problem using
the mock galaxy catalogs created by Hearin & Watson (2013, HW13), which exhibit
significant assembly bias because galaxy luminosity is tied to halo peak
circular velocity and galaxy colour is tied to halo formation time. The
preferential placement of galaxies (especially red galaxies) in older halos
affects the cutoff of the mean occupation function $\langle
N_\text{cen}(M_\text{min}) \rangle$ for central galaxies, with halos in
overdense regions more likely to host galaxies. The effect of assembly bias on
the satellite galaxy HOD is minimal. We introduce an extended, environment
dependent HOD (EDHOD) prescription to describe these results and fit galaxy
correlation measurements. Crucially, we find that the galaxy-matter
cross-correlation coefficient, $r_{gm} \equiv \xi_{gm} \cdot [ \xi_{mm}
\xi_{gg} ]^{-1/2}$, is insensitive to assembly bias on scales $r \gtrsim 1 \;
h^{-1}\text{Mpc}$, even though $\xi_{gm} $ and $\xi_{gg} $ are both affected
individually. We can therefore recover the correct $\xi_{mm} $ from the HW13
galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-matter correlations using either a standard HOD or
EDHOD fitting method. For $M_r \leq -19$ or $M_r \leq -20$ samples the recovery
of $\xi_{mm}$ is accurate to 2% or better. For a sample of red $M_r \leq -20$

modeling but lower accuracy at smaller scales or with a standard HOD fit.

symmetries at 100 and 41~meV which we assign to excitations between hybridized
bands, and depressed spectral weight below 20~meV associated with the
hybridization gap. With the increased number of Sm vacancies up to 1% we
observe an increase of spectral weight below 20~meV showing that the gap is
filling in with electronic states. For the sample with the lowest number of
vacancies the in-gap exciton excitations with long lifetimes protected by
hybridization gap are observed at 16-18~meV in E$_g$ and T$_{2g}$ symmetries.
These excitations broaden as a decrease in the lifetime with increasing number
of vacancies and are quenched by the presence of in-gap states at concentration
of Sm vacancies of about 1%. Based on this study we suggest that only the most

combinations of existing methods, which are shown to vastly improve
computational efficiency for these hierarchical models while maintaining the

incorporation in arbitrary model structures. Using the NIMBLE package for R, we
develop and test combined computational approaches using three examples from

pure heat diffusion and heat and mass diffusion together. Since no local

were complemented with JHK data from VVV survey combined with 2MASS catalogue,

formation of these systems has been extensively investigated, some crucial
issues remain unresolved. The most noticeable one is that, the low-mass
companion has difficulties in ejecting the tightly bound envelope of the
massive primary during the spiral-in process. While initially intermediate-mass
binaries are more likely to survive the common envelope (CE) evolution, the
resultant BH LMXBs mismatch the observations. In this paper, we use both
stellar evolution and binary population synthesis to study the evolutionary
history of BH LMXBs. We test various assumptions and prescriptions for the
supernova mechanisms that produce BHs, the binding energy parameter, the CE
efficiency, and the initial mass distributions of the companion stars. We
obtain the birthrate and the distributions of the donor mass, effective
temperature and orbital period for the BH LMXBs in each case. By comparing the
calculated results with the observations, we put useful constraints on the
aforementioned parameters. In particular, we show that it is possible to form
BH LMXBs with the standard CE scenario if most BHs are born through failed
supernovae.

short-term operations, flexibility here indicates that sufficient ramp

markets for ramp products have been launched in practice such as the ones in

Moreover, with higher penetration of renewable generation, the flexibility

bilateral reserve market for variable generation (VG) producers and capacity
resource providers. In this market, VG producers purchase bilateral reserve
services (BRSs) to reduce potential imbalance penalties, and BRS providers earn
profits on their available capacity for re-dispatch. We show in this paper that

passes occasionally within the disruption radius, which is the so-called tidal
disruption event(TDE). Most TDEs radiate with thermal emission resulted from
the accretion disk, but three TDEs have been detected in bright non-thermal
X-ray emission, which is interpreted as arising from the relativistic jets.
Search for high-energy gamma-ray emission from one relativistic TDE (Swift
J164449.3+573451) with the \textsl{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT) has
yielded non-detection. In this paper, we report the search for high energy
emission from the other two relativistic TDEs (Swift J2058.4+0516 Swift
J1112.2-8238) during the flare period. No significant GeV emission is found,
with an upper limit fluence in LAT energy range being less than $1\%$ of that
in X-rays. Compared with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and blazars, these TDEs have
the lowest flux ratio between GeV emission and X-ray emission. The
non-detection of high-energy emission from relativistic TDEs could be due to
that the high-energy emission is absorbed by soft photons in the source. Based
on this hypothesis, upper limits on the bulk Lorentz factors, $\Gamma\la 30$,
are then obtained for the jets in these TDEs. We also search for high-energy
gamma-ray emission from the nearest TDE discovered to date, ASASSN-14li. No
significant GeV emission is found and an upper limit of $L(\rm 0.1-10 GeV)\le
4.4\times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (at $95\%$ confidence level) is obtained for
the first $10^{7}$ s after the disruption.

~75% of the Co/Pd wires after ac-demagnetization but was less prevalent in the
FePt because the ratio of interaction field to switching field was much
smaller. Interactions also led to correlations in the domain wall positions in

of reverse domains, followed at higher fields by propagation of the domains
along the nanowires. These narrow wires provide model system for exploring
domain wall structure and dynamics in perpendicular anisotropy systems.

periods of the high/soft state, as well as the low/hard state. In each state,
Normalized Power Spectrum densities (NPSDs) were calculated in three energy
bands of 2-4 keV, 4-10 keV and 10-20 keV. The NPSDs in a frequency from 1e-7 Hz
to 1e-4 Hz are all approximated by a power-law function with an index -1.35 ~
-1.29. The fractional RMS variation ($\eta$), calculated in the above frequency
range, was found to show the following three properties; (1) $\eta$ slightly
decreases with energy in the low/hard state; (2) $\eta$ increases towards
higher energies in the high/soft state; and (3) in the 10-20 keV band, $\eta$
is 3 times higher in the high/soft state than in the low/hard state. These
properties were confirmed through studies of intensity-correlated changes of
the MAXI spectra. Of these three findings, the first one is consistent with
that seen in the short-term variability during the LHS. The latter two can be
understood as a result of high variability of the hard-tail component seen in

practical applications. We investigate the quantum coherence of two free modes
of scalar and Dirac fields as detected by two relatively accelerated observers
by resorting to the relative entropy of coherence. We show that the relative
entropy of coherence monotonically decreases when acceleration goes up, as a
consequence of the Unruh effect. Specifically, the initial states with
parameters $\alpha=b$ and $\alpha=\sqrt{1-b^2}$ have the same initial relative
entropy coherence at $a=0$ (with $a$ the acceleration), but degrade along two
different trajectories. The relative entropy of coherence reaches vanishing
value in the scalar field in the infinite acceleration limit, but non-vanishing
value in the Dirac field. This suggests that in the Dirac field, the bipartite
state possesses quantum coherence to some extent with the variation of the
relative acceleration, and may lead to potential applications in quantum
computation performed by observers in motion relatively.

circuits. It is based on a method called Lo-gic Relaxation (LoR). Given a
safety property, the LoR method relaxes the transition system at hand, which
leads to expanding the set of reachable states. For j-th time frame, the LoR
method computes a superset A_j of the set of bad states reachable in j
transitions only by the relaxed system. Set A_j is constructed by a technique
called partial quantifier elimination. If A_j does not contain a bad state and
this state is reachable in j transitions in the relaxed system, it is also
reachable in the original system. Hence the property in question does not hold.
  The appeal of PC by LoR is as follows. An inductive invariant (or a
counterexample) generated by LoR is a result of computing the states reachable
only in the relaxed system. So, the complexity of PC can be drastically reduced
by finding a ""faulty"" relaxation that is close to the original system. This is
analogous to equivalence checking whose complexity strongly depends on how
similar the designs to be compared are.

isotropic). The shear viscosity does not have a hydrodynamic interpretation in
such backgrounds, but does quantify the rate of entropy production due to a
strain. Fluctuations of the metric components $\delta g_{xy}$ are massive about
these backgrounds, leading to $\eta/s < 1/(4\pi)$ at all finite temperatures
(even in Einstein gravity). As the temperature is taken to zero, different
behaviors are possible. If translation symmetry breaking is irrelevant in the
far IR, then $\eta/s$ tends to a constant at $T=0$. This constant can be
parametrically small. If the translation symmetry is broken in the far IR
(which nonetheless develops emergent scale invariance), then $\eta/s \sim T^{2
\nu}$ as $T \to 0$, with $\nu \leq 1$ in all cases we have considered. While
these results violate simple bounds on $\eta/s$, we note that they are
consistent with a possible bound on the rate of entropy production due to
strain.

poorly understood. We address this problem by using T-shaped microfluidic
bifurcations as a model. Our computer simulations and in vitro experiments
reveal that the hematocrit ($\phi_0$) partition depends strongly on RBC
deformability, as long as $\phi_0 <20$% (within the normal range in
microcirculation), and can even lead to complete deprivation of RBCs in a child
branch. Furthermore, we discover a deviation from the Zweifach-Fung effect
which states that the child branch with lower flow rate recruits less RBCs than
the higher flow rate child branch. At small enough $\phi_0$, we get the inverse
scenario, and the hematocrit in the lower flow rate child branch is even higher
than in the parent vessel. We explain this result by an intricate up-stream RBC
organization and we highlight the extreme dependence of RBC transport on
geometrical and cell mechanical properties. These parameters can lead to
unexpected behaviors with consequences on the microcirculatory function and
oxygen delivery in healthy and pathological conditions.

Most of the 123 scrutinized RRab stars does not show any significant period

evolutionary phases. Notwithstanding this, we could put in evidence period
increases in 27 stars and decreases in 21 ones. We also used the GEOS database

maximum vs. the O-C values. We obtained a variegate family of Blazhko

Moreover, the amplitude of the Blazhko effect decreased so much to be hardly

systematic patterns and differences across experimental conditions,
participants and repetitions. This is possible because human movement is highly
regular, being constrained by invariance principles. Movement timing and
movement path, in particular, are linked through scaling laws. Separating
variations of movement timing from the spatial variations of movements is a
well-known challenge that is addressed in current approaches only through forms
of preprocessing that bias analysis. Here we propose a novel nonlinear
mixed-effects model for analyzing temporally continuous signals that contain
systematic effects in both timing and path. Identifiability issues of path
relative to timing are overcome by using maximum likelihood estimation in which
the most likely separation of space and time is chosen given the variation
found in data. The model is applied to analyze experimental data of human arm
movements in which participants move a hand-held object to a target location
while avoiding an obstacle. The model is used to classify movement data
according to participant. Comparison to alternative approaches establishes
nonlinear mixed-effects models as viable alternatives to conventional analysis
frameworks. The model is then combined with a novel factor-analysis model that
estimates the low-dimensional subspace within which movements vary when the
task demands vary. Our framework enables us to visualize different dimensions
of movement variation and to test hypotheses about the effect of obstacle
placement and height on the movement path. We demonstrate that the approach can
be used to uncover new properties of human movement.

improving efficiency of and introducing autonomy in agriculture. Field robots
are an increasingly promising branch of robotics targeted at full automation in
agriculture. The safety aspect however is rely addressed in connection with

various countries are adopting biometric solutions as security measures. The
main reason for biometric technologies becoming more common in the everyday
lives of consumers is because of the facility to easily capture biometric data
in real time, using their mobile phones. Biometric technologies are providing
the potential security framework to make banking more convenient and secure
than it has ever been. At the same time, the exponential growth of enrollment
in the biometric system produces massive amount of high dimensionality data
that leads to degradation in the performance of the mobile banking systems.
Therefore, in order to overcome the performance issues arising due to this data
deluge, this paper aims to propose a distributed mobile biometric system based
on a high performance cluster Cloud. High availability, better time efficiency
and scalability are some of the added advantages of using the proposed system.
In this paper a Cloud based mobile biometric authentication framework
(BAMCloud) is proposed that uses dynamic signatures and performs
authentication. It includes the steps involving data capture using any handheld
mobile device, then storage, preprocessing and training the system in a
distributed manner over Cloud. For this purpose we have implemented it using
MapReduce on Hadoop platform and for training Levenberg-Marquardt
backpropagation neural network has been used. Moreover, the methodology adopted
is very novel as it achieves a speedup of 8.5x and a performance of 96.23%.
Furthermore, the cost benefit analysis of the implemented system shows that the
cost of implementation and execution of the system is lesser than the existing
ones. The experiments demonstrate that the better performance is achieved by
proposed framework as compared to the other methods used in the recent
literature.

without introducing any extra electron/hole carriers, the superconducting
transition temperature $T_c$ decreases monotonously, which suggests the
existence of competition between spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation
in the superconducting state. In addition, the electronic band structure

The theoretical study is based on numerically exact diagonalizations of the

Although a magnetic field corresponding to half quantum flux is expected to
close the band gap induced by Berry phase, in all the studied geometries with
finite area cross-sections, the gap closes for magnetic fields typically larger
than those expected. Furthermore, unexpectedly, due to geometrical quantum
interference effects, for a rectangular wire with a sufficiently large aspect
ratio and smaller side ranging from 50{\deg}A and 100{\deg}A, the gap closes
for a specific finite area cross-section without the application of a magnetic

most difficult part of the analysis is related to one of the invariant
amplitudes, denoted as $T_1(\nu, Q^2)$, which requires a subtraction in the
standard dispersion relation with respect to the energy $\nu$ at fixed photon
momentum squared $q^2=-Q^2$. We propose an alternative dispersive framework,
which implements analyticity and unitarity by combining the Cauchy integral
relation at low and moderate energies with the modulus representation of the
amplitude at high energies. Using techniques of functional analysis, we derive
a necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency with analyticity of
the subtraction function $S_1(Q^2)=T_1(0, Q^2)$, the electron-proton cross
sections measured at low and moderate energies and the Regge model assumed to
be valid at high energies. From this condition we obtain model-independent
constraints on the subtraction function, confronting them with the available
information on nucleon magnetic polarizabilities and results reported recently
in the literature. The formalism can be used also for testing the existence of
a fixed pole at $J=0$ in the angular momentum plane, but more accurate data are
necessary for a definite answer.

particular, this involves the study of commutative C*-algebras in relationship

Bohrification, in which one studies commutative unital C*-subalgebras of a
given noncommutative C*-algebra, or asymptotic Bohrification, which involves
deformations of commutative C*-algebras into noncommutative ones. Implementing
the doctrine of classical concepts, exact Bohrification is an appropriate
framework for the Kochen-Specker Theorem and for (intuitionistic) quantum
logic, culminating in the topos-theoretic approach to quantum mechanics that
has been developed since 1998. Asymptotic Bohrification was inspired by the
correspondence principle and forms the right conceptual and mathematical
framework for the explanation of the emergence of the classical world from
quantum theory (incorporating the measurement problem and the closely related
issue of spontaneous symmetry breaking). The Born rule may be derived from both

$Y_1,\ldots,Y_n$ are modeled in dependence of i.i.d. random functions

regression model. It is assumed that there exists an unknown number of ""points

functional values possess significant influences on the response variable. In
addition to estimating a functional slope parameter, the problem then is to
determine the number and locations of points of impact as well as corresponding
regression coefficients. Identifiability of the generalized model is considered
in detail. It is shown that points of impact are identifiable if the underlying
process generating $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ possesses ""specific local variation.""
Examples are well-known processes like the Brownian motion, fractional Brownian
motion or the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The paper then proposes an easily
implementable method for estimating the number and locations of points of
impact. It is shown that this number can be estimated consistently.
Furthermore, rates of convergence for location estimates, regression
coefficients and the slope parameter are derived. Finally, some simulation
results as well as a real data application are presented.

the imperfections of practical devices, especially the limited efficiency of a
single-photon detector. In this paper, we propose a non-Gaussian postselection
method to emulate the photon substraction used in coherent-state CV QKD
protocols. The virtual photon subtraction not only can avoid the complexity and
imperfections of a practical photon-subtraction operation, which extends the
secure transmission distance as the ideal case does, but also can be adjusted
flexibly according to the channel parameters to optimize the performance.
Furthermore, our preliminary tests on the information reconciliation suggest
that in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime, the performance of reconciliating
the postselected non-Gaussian data is better than that of the Gaussian data,
which implies the feasibility of implementing this method practically.

divides a program into basic (branchless) blocks and estimates the maximal and

it combines the obtained values according to the program control flow, using
static analysis, to infer functions that give both upper and lower bounds on

be applied to other microprocessor architectures and programming languages. The

Gaussian stationary autoregressive vectors. This is equivalent to consider the
estimation of a structured scatter matrix of a Spherically Invariant Random
Vector (SIRV) whose structure comes from an autoregressive modelization. The
Toeplitz structure representative of stationary models is a particular case for
the class of structures we consider. For Gaussian autoregressive processes,
Burg method is often used in case of stationarity for its efficiency when few
samples are available. Unfortunately, if we directly apply these methods to
estimate the common scatter matrix of N vectors coming from a non-Gaussian
distribution, their efficiency will strongly decrease. We propose then to adapt
these methods to scale mixtures of autoregressive vectors by changing the
energy functional minimized in the Burg algorithm. Moreover, we study several
approaches of robust modification of the introduced Burg algorithms, based on
Fr\'echet medians defined for the Euclidean or the Poincar\'e metric, in

correct time series without not-anomalous data, the extremes time series are

considered lagged among them. We think that climate events frequently are
lagged because the climate show a clear increasing tendency, and that climate
risks are potentially increasing during the time. There will be no specific

We derive the expected distribution of distances and relative proper motions

effects that affect the planet detection sensitivity as a function of distance,
and compare it to the observed distribution using Anderson-Darling (AD)
hypothesis testing. Taking the relative abundance of planets in the bulge to

is only consistent with the observed distribution for $f_{\rm bulge}<0.54$ (for
a $p$-value threshold of 0.01) implying that the bulge may be devoid of planets
relative to the disk. Allowing for a dependence of planet abundance on
metallicity and host mass, or an additional dependence of planet sensitivity on
event timescale does not restore consistency for $f_{\rm bulge}=1$. We examine
the distance estimates of some events in detail, and conclude that some
parallax-based distance estimates could be significantly in error. Only by
combining the removal of one problematic event from our sample and the
inclusion of strong dependences of planet abundance or detection sensitivity on

represent the observed centre-of-disc spectrum of Uranus well, and both require
similar cloud scattering properties of the main cloud residing at approximately
2 bars. However, a modified version of the Sromovsky, Fry and Tomasko (2011)

reflected radiance from Uranus arises from a thick cloud at approximately the 2

sources emission. Here we investigate the potential impact of such structure on
the resultant energy spectrum. Using data from the well documented outbursts of
XTE J$1550$-$564$ we looked at possible hints that the presence of
Quasi-Periodic Oscillations actually impacts the energy spectrum emitted by the
source. In particular we look at the evolution of the relation between the
inner disc radius and the inner disc temperature obtained from fits to the
spectral data. We then test this further by developing a simple model in order
to simulate spectra of a disk with a structure mimicking an increasing in
strength Quasi-Periodic Oscillation and compare the simulated results to those

inner temperature curve coming from the standard fit of our simulated

structure at the origin of the Quasi-Periodic Oscillation impact the energy

inaccuracy of the determination of the disk parameters increases with the
strength of the Quasi-Periodic Oscillation, an increase which then renders the
value given by the fit unreliable for strong Quasi-Periodic Oscillation.

characterised by highly skewed and power-lawlike distributions. An example of
this, which is considered in this paper, is the number of visits to a
specialist, often taken as a measure of demand in healthcare. A discrete
Weibull regression model was recently proposed for regression problems with a
discrete response and it was shown to possess two important features: the
ability to capture over and under-dispersion simultaneously and a closed-form
analytical expression of the quantiles of the conditional distribution. In this
paper, we propose the first Bayesian implementation of a discrete Weibull
regression model. The implementation considers a novel parameterization, where
both parameters of the discrete Weibull distribution can be made dependent on
the predictors. In addition, prior distributions can be imposed that encourage
parameter shrinkage and that lead to variable selection. As with Bayesian
procedures, the full posterior distribution of the parameters is returned, from
which credible intervals can be readily calculated. A simulation study and the
analysis of four real datasets of medical records show promises for the wide
applicability of this approach to the analysis of count data. The method is
implemented in the R package BDWreg.

century condensed matter physics. So far, the search for a light counterpart of
an electronic topological insulator has remained elusive. This is due to the
fundamentally different natures of light and matter and the different spins of
photons and electrons. Here, it is shown that the theory of electronic
topological insulators has a genuine analogue in the context of light wave
propagation in time-reversal invariant continuous materials. We introduce a
Gauge invariant $Z_2$ index that depends on the global properties of the
photonic band structure and is robust to any continuous weak variation of the
material parameters that preserves the time-reversal invariance. A nontrivial
$Z_2$ index has two possible causes: (i) the lack of smoothness of the
pseudo-Hamiltonian in the ${\bf{k}} \to \infty$ limit, and (ii) the
entanglement between positive and negative frequency eigenmode branches. In
particular, it is proven that electric-type plasmas and magnetic-type plasmas
are topologically inequivalent for a fixed wave polarization. We propose a
bulk-edge correspondence that links the number of edge modes with the
topological invariants of two continuous bulk materials, and present detailed
numerical examples that illustrate the application of the theory.

Stark broadening of emission in a helium plasma with an electron density
$n_e\simeq 5\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$. More than $30$ nitrogen and more than
$10$ neon lines emission lines were detected in both systems. Additionally,
$20$ nitrogen absorption lines are only seen in GP Com. The radial velocity
variations of these lines show the same phase and velocity amplitude as the
central helium emission components. The small semi-amplitude of the central
helium emission component, the consistency of phase and amplitude with the
absorption components in GP Com as well as the measured Stark effect shows that
the central helium emission component, the so-called central-spike, is
consistent with an origin on the accreting white dwarf. We use the dynamics of
the bright spot and the central spike to constrain the binary parameters for
both systems and find a donor mass of $9.6$ - $42.8$ M$_{\rm Jupiter}$ for GP
Com and $6.1$ - $30.5$ M$_{\rm Jupiter}$ for V396 Hya. We find an upper limit
for the rotational velocity of the accretor of $v_{\rm rot}<46$ km s$^{-1}$ for
GP Com and $v_{\rm rot}<59$ km s$^{-1}$ for V396 Hya which excludes a fast
rotating accretor in both systems.

heat transport in one-dimensional (1D) anharmonic oscillator systems with a
double-well type interatomic interaction like $V(\xi)=-\xi^2/2+\xi^4/4$, when
the system temperature is varied. In order to better understand this unusual
manner of thermal transport, here we perform a direct dynamics simulation to
examine how the spreading processes of the three physical quantities, i.e., the
heat, the total energy and the momentum, would depend on temperature. We find
three main points that are worth noting: (i) The crossover from superdiffusive
to normal heat transport is well verified from a new perspective of heat
spread; (ii) The spreading of the total energy is found to be very distinct
from heat diffusion, especially that under some temperature regimes, energy is
strongly localized, while heat can be superdiffusive. So one should take care
to derive a general connection between the heat conduction and energy
diffusion; (iii) In a narrow range of temperatures, the spreading of momentum
implies clear unusual non-ballistic behaviors; however, such unusual transport
of momentum cannot be directly related to the normal transport of heat. An
analysis of phonons spectra suggests that one should also take the effects of
phonons softening into account. All of these results may provide insights into
establishing the connection between the macroscopic heat transport and the
underlying dynamics in 1D systems.

more prominent in energy bands where the reflection component is more

Recently, these states have been observed in the transient dynamics of

we present an exact analytical solution of the steady-state density matrix for
this class of systems, including one-photon losses, which are considered
detrimental for the achievement of cat states. We demonstrate that the unique
steady state is a statistical mixture of two cat-like states with opposite
parity, in spite of significant one-photon losses. The transient dynamics to
the steady state depends dramatically on the initial state and can pass through
a metastable regime lasting orders of magnitudes longer than the photon
lifetime. By considering individual quantum trajectories in photon-counting
configuration, we find that the system intermittently jumps between two cats.
Finally, we propose and study a feedback protocol based on this behaviour to
generate a pure cat-like steady state.

that buckles at a high deformation rate and alters the downstream fluid flow.
The microactuator consists of a confined, thin, dielectric film that buckles
into the microfluidic channel when exposed to voltage supplied through
conductive fluid electrodes. We estimate the critical buckling voltage, and
characterize the buckled shape of the actuator. Finally, we investigate the
effects of frequency, flow rate, and the pressure differences on the behavior
of the buckling structure and the resulting fluid flow. These results
demonstrate that the voltage--induced buckling of embedded microstructures
using fluid electrodes provides a means for high speed attenuation of
microfluidic flow.

transformation approach, mapping probability densities to a Hilbert space of

data analysis, such as the construction of functional modes of variation,
functional regression or classification, are then implemented by using
representations of the densities in this linear space. Representations of the
densities themselves are obtained by applying the inverse map from the linear
functional space to the density space. Transformations of interest include log
quantile density and log hazard transformations, among others. Rates of
convergence are derived for the representations that are obtained for a general
class of transformations under certain structural properties. If the
subject-specific densities need to be estimated from data, these rates
correspond to the optimal rates of convergence for density estimation. The
proposed methods are illustrated through simulations and applications in brain
imaging.

into phase behavior, ordering and out-equilibrium glass transitions.
Experimentally it has been shown that oscillatory shearing of a monodisperse
hard sphere glass, produces two different crystal orientations; a Face Centered
Cubic (FCC) crystal with the close packed direction parallel to shear at high
strains and an FCC crystal with the close packed direction perpendicular to
shear at low strains. Here, using Brownian dynamics simulations of hard sphere
particles, we have examined high volume fraction shear-induced crystals under
oscillatory shear as well as the same volume fraction glass counterparts. We
find that, while the displacements under shear of the glass are isotropic, the
sheared FCC crystal structures oriented parallel to shear, are anisotropic due
to the cooperative motion of velocity-vorticity layers of particles sliding
over each other. These sliding layers generally result in lower stresses and
less overall particle displacements. Additionally, from the two crystal types,
the perpendicular crystal exhibits less stresses and displacements at smaller
strains, however at larger strains, the sliding layers of the parallel crystal
are found to be more efficient in minimizing stresses and displacements, while
the perpendicular crystal becomes unstable. The findings of this work suggest
that the process of shear-induced ordering for a colloidal glass is facilitated
by large out of cage displacements, which allow the system to explore the
energy landscape and find the minima in energy, stresses and displacements by
configuring particles into a crystal oriented parallel to shear.

In contrast with these reports, here we show that the lowest phonon dispersion
branch of atomistically described few-layer materials should be quadratic, and
this can have dramatic consequencies on calculated properties, such as the
thermal conductivity. By reformulating the interatomic force constants (IFC) in
terms of internal coordinates, we find that a delicate balance between the IFCs
is responsible for this quadraticity. This balance is hard to obtain in
ab-initio calculations even if all the symmetries are numerically enforced a
posteriori, but it arises naturally in our approach. We demonstrate the
phenomenon in the case of borophene, where a very subtle correction to the
ab-initio IFCs yields the physically correct quadratic dispersion, while
leaving the rest of the spectrum virtually unmodified. Such quadraticity
nevertheless has a major effect on the computed lattice thermal conductivity,
which in the case of borophene changes by more than a factor 2, and reverses
its anisotropy, when the subtle IFC correction is put in place.

two coeval stars in detached double-lined eclipsing binary systems that are
only caused by observational uncertainties. We focus on stars in the mass range
[0.8; 1.6] Msun, and on stars in the main-sequence phase. The ages were
obtained by means of the maximum-likelihood SCEPtER technique. The
observational constraints used in the recovery procedure are stellar mass,
radius, effective temperature, and metallicity [Fe/H]. We defined the statistic
W computed as the ratio of the absolute difference of estimated ages for the
two stars over the age of the older one. We determined the critical values of
this statistics above which coevality can be rejected. The median expected
difference in the reconstructed age between the coeval stars of a binary system
-- caused alone by the observational uncertainties -- shows a strong dependence
on the evolutionary stage. This ranges from about 20% for an evolved primary
star to about 75% for a near ZAMS primary. The median difference also shows an
increase with the mass of the primary star from 20% for 0.8 Msun stars to about
50% for 1.6 Msun stars. The reliability of these results was checked by
repeating the process with a grid of stellar models computed by a different
evolutionary code. We show that the W test is much more sensible to age
differences in the binary system components than the alternative approach of
comparing the confidence interval of the age of the two stars. We also found
that the distribution of W is, for almost all the examined cases, well
approximated by beta distributions. The proposed method improves upon the
techniques that are commonly adopted for judging the coevality of an observed
system. It also provides a result founded on reliable statistics that
simultaneously accounts for all the observational uncertainties.

state-dependent coupling of automata to introduce nonequilibrium steady states.
This paper also demonstrates how our minimum cycle basis construction provides
conditions that ensure against violations of microscopic reversibility. In
addition, the minimum cycle basis construction is an interesting combinatorial
problem in itself.

magnetic configurations. However, the diversity of possible configurations in a
single device is usually rather limited. The achievement of a broad variety of
magnetic configurations might be valuable for some purposes, for example, to
assay the effect of the magnetic configuration on turbulent transport. Thus, a
method is created to systematically define sets of modular coils located on
concentric toroidal winding surfaces. The method is based on the expression of
a Last Closed Flux Surface (LCFS) by Fourier coefficients in cylindrical
coordinates and consists in the definition of successive windings located on
equidistant concentric winding surfaces, each winding such that produces a
magnetic field which, when added to the magnetic field generated by a sole base
winding that generates a base magnetic configuration, produces a magnetic
configuration whose LCFS is defined by the Fourier coefficients of the base
magnetic configuration plus only one new Fourier coefficient. The utilization
of a diversity of currents in the different windings would give a linear
combination of magnetic fields that reproduce the LCFS defined mathematically
by the respective Fourier coefficients. The deviation between a particular
modelled LCFS and the obtained LCFS from the windings depends on: the order and
value of each Fourier coefficient, the selected shape of concentric winding
surfaces, and the possible intersection of the LCFS with the internal winding
surface. The method to generate the windings is reported and the application to
one case study is described. Each modelled LCFS is compared with the respective
Poincar\'e plot obtained from the linear combination of magnetic fields from
the windings.

intervals are scanned separately by different volunteers and then joined
together. We also use an alternative, faster, approach when searching the
best-fit period by using a model of triaxial ellipsoid. By this, we can
independently confirm periods found with convex models and also find rotation
periods for some of those asteroids for which the convex-model approach gives
too many solutions. From the analysis of Lowell photometric data of the first
100,000 numbered asteroids, we derived 328 new models. This almost doubles the
number of available models. We tested the reliability of our results by
comparing models that were derived from purely Lowell data with those based on
dense lightcurves, and we found that the rate of false-positive solutions is
very low. We also present updated plots of the distribution of spin obliquities

the probability of a social image belonging to one particular class. We explore
the co-occurrence of user-contributed tags to find subclasses with a strong

resulting subclass space to generate a subclass representation for the image.
The novelty of the approach is that subclass representations make use of not

co-occurrence of their tags, which determines membership in both subclasses and
top-level classes. The novelty is also that the images are classified into
smaller classes, which have a chance of being more visually stable and easier

represented in this space by their probability of relatedness to all of the

interactions when nonlinearities and the appropriate propagation of signals are
at work. These kinds of phenomena can be modeled with different frameworks,
typically cellular automata or reaction-diffusion systems. A different class of
dynamical processes involves the correlated movement of agents over space,
which can be mediated through chemotactic movement or minimization of cell-cell
interaction energy. A classic example of the latter is given by the formation
of spatially segregated assemblies when cells display differential adhesion.
Here we consider a new class of dynamical models, involving cell adhesion among
two stochastically exchangeable cell states as a minimal model capable of
exhibiting well-defined, ordered spatial patterns. Our results suggest that a
whole space of pattern-forming rules is hosted by the combination of physical
differential adhesion and the value of probabilities modulating cell phenotypic
switching, showing that Turing-like patterns can be obtained without resorting
to reaction-diffusion processes. If the model is expanded allowing cells to
proliferate and die in an environment where diffusible nutrient and toxic waste
are at play, different phases are observed, characterized by regularly spaced
patterns. The analysis of the parameter space reveals that certain phases reach
higher population levels than other modes of organization. A detailed
exploration of the mean-field theory is also presented. Finally we let
populations of cells with different adhesion matrices compete for reproduction,
showing that, in our model, structural organization can improve the fitness of
a given cell population. The implications of these results for ecological and
evolutionary models of pattern formation and the emergence of multicellularity
are outlined.

decade in areas such as object, scene and speech recognition. In particular
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a category of deep learning which obtains
excellent results in object detection and recognition tasks. Its architecture
is indeed well suited to object analysis by learning and classifying complex
(deep) features that represent parts of an object or the object itself.
However, some of its features are very similar to texture analysis methods. CNN
layers can be thought of as filter banks of complexity increasing with the
depth. Filter banks are powerful tools to extract texture features and have
been widely used in texture analysis. In this paper we develop a simple network
architecture named Texture CNN (T-CNN) which explores this observation. It is
built on the idea that the overall shape information extracted by the fully
connected layers of a classic CNN is of minor importance in texture analysis.
Therefore, we pool an energy measure from the last convolution layer which we
connect to a fully connected layer. We show that our approach can improve the
performance of a network while greatly reducing the memory usage and

best for Hamiltonians with a few interactions with very large $k$ and can be

Percolation (DBP) process models, through stochastic local rules, the
dependence of an edge $(a,b)$ in a network on the states of its neighboring
edges. Unlike previous models, DBP does not assume statistical independence
between different edges. In applications, this means for example that failures
of transmission lines in a power grid are not statistically independent, or
alternatively, relationships between individuals (dyads) can lead to changes in
other dyads in a social network. We consider the time evolution of the
probability distribution of the network state, the collective states of all the
edges (bonds), and show that it converges to a stationary distribution. We use
this distribution to study the emergence of global behaviors like consensus
(i.e., catastrophic failure or full recovery of the entire grid) or coexistence
(i.e., some failed and some operating substructures in the grid). In
particular, we show that, depending on the local dynamical rule, different

binary star system with an 18-day orbital period. Recently, an eclipse timing
study of the Kepler binaries has revealed eclipse timing variations in this
object with an amplitude of about 100 sec, and an outer period of 529 days. The
implied mass of the third body is that of a superJupiter, but below the mass of
a brown dwarf. We therefore embarked on a radial velocity study of this binary
to determine its system configuration and to check the hypothesis that it hosts
a giant planet. From the radial velocity measurements, it became immediately
obvious that the same Kepler target contains another eccentric binary, this one
with a 16.5-day orbital period. Direct imaging using adaptive optics reveals
that the two binaries are separated by 0.4 arcsec (about 167 AU), and have
nearly the same magnitude (to within 2%). The close angular proximity of the
two binaries, and very similar Gamma velocities, strongly suggest that KIC
7177553 is one of the rare SB4 systems consisting of two eccentric binaries
where at least one system is eclipsing. Both systems consist of slowly
rotating, non-evolved, solar-like stars of comparable masses. From the orbital
separation and the small difference in Gamma velocity, we infer that the period
of the outer orbit most likely lies in the range 1000 to 3000 years. New images
taken over the next few years, as well as the high-precision astrometry of the
Gaia satellite mission, will allow us to set much narrower constraints on the
system geometry. Finally, we note that the observed eclipse timing variations
in the Kepler data cannot be produced by the second binary. Further
spectroscopic observations on a longer time scale will be required to prove the
existence of the massive planet.

brightness are the most similar to SN 2010aq and PS1-13arp, for which the
ultraviolet emission within a few days after the shock breakout was detected.
The lower limit of the event rate of rapidly rising transients is ~9 % of
core-collapse supernova rates, assuming a duration of rapid rise to be 1 day.
We show that the light curves of the three faint objects agree with the cooling
envelope emission from the explosion of red supergiants. The other two luminous
objects are, however, brighter and faster than the cooling envelope emission.
We interpret these two objects to be the shock breakout from dense wind with
the mass loss rate of ~10^{-3} Msun yr^{-1}, as also proposed for PS1-13arp.
This mass loss rate is higher than that typically observed for red supergiants.
The event rate of these luminous objects is >~1 % of core-collapse supernova
rate, and thus, our study implies that more than ~1 % of massive stars can
experience an intensive mass loss at a few years before the explosion.

  Since OCT is mathematically modelled by Maxwell's equations or some
simplifications of it, whereas the light propagation in quantitative
photoacoustics is modelled by (simplifications of) the radiative transfer
equation, the first step in the derivation of a mathematical model of the dual
experiment is to obtain a unified mathematical description, which in our case
are Maxwell's equations. As a by-product we therefore derive a new mathematical
model of photoacoustic tomography based on Maxwell's equations.
  It is well known by now, that without additional assumptions on the medium,
it is not possible to uniquely reconstruct all optical parameters from either
one of these modalities alone. We show that in the combined approach one has
additional information, compared to a single modality, and the inverse problem

comprises studies of the literature in psychology and SE, quantitative
experiments, and a qualitative study, for constructing a multifaceted theory of
the link between affects and programming performance. The theory explicates the
linkage between affects and analytical problem-solving performance of
developers, their software development task productivity, and the process
behind the linkage. The results are novel in the domains of SE and psychology,
and they fill an important lack that had been raised by both previous research
and by practitioners. The implications of this PhD lie in setting out the basic
building blocks for researching and understanding the affect of software
developers, and how it is related to software development performance. Overall,
the evidence hints that happy software developers perform better in analytic
problem solving, are more productive while developing software, are prone to
share their feelings in order to let researchers and managers understand them,
and are susceptible to interventions for enhancing their affects on the job.

incorporating a novel concept of {\em duality structure} and its applications
into various nonlinear dynamical problems is presented. The duality structure
is an asymptotic property that should affect the late time asymptotic behaviour
of a nonlinear dynamical system in a nontrivial way leading naturally to
signatures generic to a complex system. We argue that the present formalism
would offer a natural framework to understand the abundance of complex systems
in natural, biological, financial and related problems. We show that the power
law attenuation of a dispersive, lossy wave equation, conventionally deduced
from fractional calculus techniques, could actually arise from the present
asymptotic duality structure. Differentiability on a Cantor type fractal set is
also formulated.

Many Mathematician has been studied the relations between rough sets and
algebraic systems such as groups, rings and modules. In this paper we will
introduce the lower and upper approximations in a quotient group. We will
discuss several properties of the lower and upper approximations. Moreover
under some additional assumptions we are able to show that the lower
approximation is a normal subgroup of the quotient group but this property
fails for the upper approximation. At the end we will develop several
homomorphisms between lower approximations.

services of the Information Technology for Educational Management(ITEM). These
services require data intensive and communication intensive applications. Due
to the massive growth of information, situation becomes difficult to manage
these services. Here the role of the Information and Communication Technology
(ICT) infrastructure particularly data centre with communication components
becomes important to facilitate these services. The present paper discusses the
related issues such as competent staff, appropriate ICT infrastructure, ICT
acceptance level etc. required for ITEM competence building framework
considering the earlier approach for core competences for ITEM. It this
connection, it is also necessary to consider the procurement of standard and
appropriate ICT facilities. This will help in the integration of these
facilities for the future expansion. This will also enable to create and
foresee the impact of the pairing the management with information, technology,
and education components individually and combined. These efforts will
establish a strong coupling between the ITEM activities and resource management
for effective implementation of the framework.
