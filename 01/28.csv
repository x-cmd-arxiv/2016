trivial one, e.g., Heisenberg and orthosymplectic supergroups in mixed
signature. To avoid this situation, we introduce in this paper a broader
definition of superunitary representation, relying on a new definition of
Hilbert superspace. The latter is inspired by the notion of Krein space and was
developed initially for noncommutative supergeometry. For Heisenberg
supergroups, this new approach yields a smooth generalization, whatever the
signature, of the unitary representation theory of the classical Heisenberg
group. First, we obtain Schrodinger-like representations by quantizing generic
coadjoint orbits. They satisfy the new definition of irreducible superunitary
representations and serve as ground to the main result of this paper: a
generalized Stone-von Neumann theorem. Then, we obtain the superunitary dual
and build a group Fourier transformation, satisfying Parseval theorem. We
eventually show that metaplectic representations, which extend Schrodinger-like
representations to metaplectic supergroups, also fit into this definition of
superunitary representations.

(ICN) architectures is the ability to support packet-level caching at every
node in the network. By individually naming each packet, ICN allows routers to
turn their queueing buffers into packet caches, thus exploiting the network's
existing storage resources. However, the performance of packet caching at
commodity routers is restricted by the small capacity of their SRAM, which
holds the index for the packets stored at the, slower, DRAM. We therefore
propose Object-oriented Packet Caching (OPC), a novel caching scheme that
overcomes the SRAM bottleneck, by combining object-level indexing in the SRAM
with packet-level storage in the DRAM. We implemented OPC and experimentally
evaluated it over various cache placement policies, showing that it can enhance
the impact of ICN packet-level caching, reducing both network and server load.

special choices of the parameters, this model may represent a cusped clump of
cold DM, a cored clump of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) or an ultra
compact minihalo of DM surrounding a massive point-like object. We built the
resulting micro-amplification curves for various parameters of one clump moving
with respect to the source in order to estimate differences between the light
curves caused by clumps and by point lenses. The results show that it may be
difficult to distinguish between these models. However, some region of the
clump parameters can be restricted by considering the high amplification events
at the present level of photometric accuracy. Then we estimate the statistical
properties of the amplification curves in extragalactic GLSs. For this purpose,
an ensemble of amplification curves is generated yielding the autocorrelation

been recently proposed that properties of the accretion flow around Sgr A* can
be probed through its interactions with the stellar wind of nearby massive
stars belonging to the S-cluster. When a star intercepts the accretion disk,
the ram and thermal pressures of the disk terminate the stellar wind leading to
the formation of a bow shock structure. Here, a semi-analytical model is
constructed which describes the geometry of the termination shock formed in the
wind. With the employment of numerical hydrodynamic simulations, this model is
both verified and extended to a region prone to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.
Because the characteristic wind and stellar velocities are in $\sim10^{8}$ cm
s$^{-1}$ range, the shocked wind may produce detectable X-rays via thermal
bremsstrahlung emission. The application of this model to the pericenter
passage of S2, the brightest member of the S-cluster, shows that the shocked
wind produces roughly a month long X-ray flare with a peak luminosity of
$L\approx 4 \times 10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for a stellar mass-loss rate, disk
number density, and thermal pressure strength of $\dot{M}_{\rm w}= 10^{-7}
M_\odot\, {\rm yr}^{-1}$, $n_{\rm d} = 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$, and $\alpha=0.1$,
respectively. This peak luminosity is comparable to the quiescent X-ray
emission detected from Sgr A* and is within the detection capabilities of
current X-ray observatories. Its detection could constrain the density and
thickness of the disk at a distance of $\sim 3000$ gravitational radii from the
supermassive black hole.

late-type galaxy similar to the Milky Way, composed of an exponential disk and
an NFW dark matter halo. We place the galaxy on four different orbits in a
Virgo-like cluster and evolve it for 10 Gyr. As a reference case we also evolve
the same model in isolation. Tidally induced bars form on all orbits soon after
the first pericenter passage and survive until the end of the evolution. They
appear earlier, are stronger, longer and have lower pattern speeds for tighter
orbits. Only for the tightest orbit the properties of the bar are controlled by
the orientation of the tidal torque from the cluster at pericenters. The
mechanism behind the formation of the bars is the angular momentum transfer
from the galaxy stellar component to its halo. All bars undergo extended
periods of buckling instability that occur earlier and lead to more pronounced
boxy/peanut shapes when the tidal forces are stronger. Using all simulation
outputs of galaxies at different evolutionary stages we construct a toy model
of the galaxy population in the cluster and measure the average bar strength
and bar fraction as a function of clustercentric radius. Both are found to be
mildly decreasing functions of radius. We conclude that tidal forces can
trigger bar formation in cluster cores, but not in the outskirts, and thus
cause larger concentrations of barred galaxies towards cluster center.

carefully adapted and translated into Norwegian an existing instrument, the
Introductory Astronomy Questionnaire (IAQ); we administered this adapted IAQ to
(i) pre-service teachers at the largest teacher education institution in
Norway, and (ii) students drawn from eight middle schools in Oslo, in both
cases before and after astronomy instruction. Amongst our preliminary findings
- based on an analysis of both free-response writing and multiple-choice
responses - was that when prompted to provide responses to hypothetical
students, the pre-service teachers exhibited a marked drop in pedagogical
responses pre- to post-instruction, with corresponding shifts towards more
authoritative responses. We also identified potentially serious issues relating
to middle school students' conceptions of size and distances in the universe,
with significant stratification along gender lines.

molecular sequences to be integrated into a single combined inference of
divergence dates under the rule of Bayesian probability. In particular the
fossilized birth-death tree prior and the Lewis-Mk model of discrete
morphological evolution allow for the estimation of both divergence times and
phylogenetic relationships between fossil and extant taxa. We exploit this
statistical framework to investigate the internal consistency of these models
by producing phylogenetic estimates of the age of each fossil in turn, within
two rich and well-characterized data sets of fossil and extant species
(penguins and canids). We find that the estimation accuracy of fossil ages is
generally high with credible intervals seldom excluding the true age and median
relative error in the two data sets of 5.7% and 13.2% respectively. The median
relative standard error (RSD) was 9.2% and 7.2% respectively, suggesting good
precision, although with some outliers. In fact in the two data sets we analyze
the phylogenetic estimates of fossil age is on average < 2 My from the midpoint
age of the geological strata from which it was excavated. The high level of
internal consistency found in our analyses suggests that the Bayesian
statistical model employed is an adequate fit for both the geological and
morphological data, and provides evidence from real data that the framework
used can accurately model the evolution of discrete morphological traits coded
from fossil and extant taxa. We anticipate that this approach will have diverse
applications beyond divergence time dating, including dating fossils that are
temporally unconstrained, testing of the ""morphological clock"", and for
uncovering potential model misspecification and/or data errors when
controversial phylogenetic hypotheses are obtained based on combined divergence
dating analyses.

approaches: in the first one, photonic currents arise as a consequence of a
phase difference of applied lasers and in the second one, photons are injected
locally and currents develop as they redistribute over the lattice. Effects of
interactions are taken into account within a mean-field framework. In the first
approach, we find that the current exhibits a resonant behavior with respect to
the driving frequency. Weak interactions shift the resonant frequency toward
higher values, while in the strongly interacting regime in our mean-field
treatment the effect stems from multiphotonic resonances of a single driven
cavity. For the second approach, we show that the overall lattice current can
be controlled by incorporating few cavities with stronger dissipation rates
into the system. These cavities serve as sinks for photonic currents and their
effect is maximal at the onset of quantum Zeno dynamics.

the determination of the mass hierarchy of neutrinos. These objectives are
strongly motivated by two recent important discoveries, namely: 1) The
high-energy astrophysical neutrino signal reported by IceCube and 2) the
sizable contribution of electron neutrinos to the third neutrino mass
eigenstate as reported by Daya Bay, Reno and others. To meet these objectives,
the KM3NeT Collaboration plans to build a new Research Infrastructure
consisting of a network of deep-sea neutrino telescopes in the Mediterranean
Sea. A phased and distributed implementation is pursued which maximises the
access to regional funds, the availability of human resources and the
synergetic opportunities for the earth and sea sciences community. Three
suitable deep-sea sites are identified, namely off-shore Toulon (France), Capo
Passero (Italy) and Pylos (Greece). The infrastructure will consist of three
so-called building blocks. A building block comprises 115 strings, each string
comprises 18 optical modules and each optical module comprises 31
photo-multiplier tubes. Each building block thus constitutes a 3-dimensional
array of photo sensors that can be used to detect the Cherenkov light produced
by relativistic particles emerging from neutrino interactions. Two building
blocks will be configured to fully explore the IceCube signal with different
methodology, improved resolution and complementary field of view, including the
Galactic plane. One building block will be configured to precisely measure
atmospheric neutrino oscillations.

of the Fano's inequality, to obtain information-theoretic limits of structure
recovery for any exponential family BN. We instantiate our result for specific

conduct measurements of the polarization of quarks produced in top-quark
decays. The bottom quarks from the $t \to W^+ b$ decays, as well as the charm,
strange, up and down quarks from the subsequent $W^+ \to c\bar s, u\bar d$
decays, are polarized. When a polarized quark hadronizes to a baryon, its
polarization is partly preserved, and is reflected in the angular distributions
of the baryon decay products. For the strange and bottom quarks, this effect
has already been seen in hadronic $Z$ decays at LEP. In Run 2 of the LHC,
$t\bar t$ samples will have comparable statistics and several advantages from
the point of view of flavor tagging. We propose strategies for such
measurements in ATLAS and CMS. We estimate that precision of order $10\%$ is
attainable for the polarizations of the strange, charm and bottom quarks. In
future higher-statistics runs, polarizations of up and down quarks might be
measurable as well.

the RF domain to reduce the number of required RF chains. An algorithm that
designs the RF combining for this architecture is developed and analyzed.

linear and nonlinear methods with their respective drawbacks. A novel approach
we propose is the use of descriptors of the shape of the dynamical attractor as
a feature representation of nature of dynamics. The proposed framework has two
main advantages over traditional approaches: a) representation of the dynamical
system is derived directly from the observational data, without any inherent
assumptions, and b) the proposed features show stability under different
time-series lengths where traditional dynamical invariants fail. We illustrate
our idea using nonlinear dynamical models such as Lorenz and Rossler systems,
where our feature representations (shape distribution) support our hypothesis
that the local shape of the reconstructed phase space can be used as a
discriminative feature. Our experimental analyses on these models also indicate
that the proposed framework show stability for different time-series lengths,
which is useful when the available number of samples are small/variable. The
specific applications of interest in this paper are: 1) activity recognition
using motion capture and RGBD sensors, 2) activity quality assessment for
applications in stroke rehabilitation, and 3) dynamical scene classification.
We provide experimental validation through action and gesture recognition
experiments on motion capture and Kinect datasets. In all these scenarios, we
show experimental evidence of the favorable properties of the proposed
representation.

particles can produce large-scale discharges in form of lightning resulting in
a substantial sudden increase of local ionisation. Brown dwarfs are observed to
emit cyclotron radio emission. We show that signatures of strong transient
atmospheric ionisation events (flash ionisation) can be imprinted on a
pre-existing radiation. Detection of such flash ionisation events will open
investigations into the ionisation state and atmospheric dynamics. Such
ionisation events can also result from explosion shock waves, bursts or
eruptions. We present an analytical model that describes the modulation of a
pre-existing electromagnetic radiation by a time-dependent (flash) conductivity
that is characteristic for flash ionisation events like lightning. Our
conductivity model reproduces the conductivity function derived from
observations of Terrestrial Gamma Ray Flashes, and is applicable to
astrophysical objects with strong temporal variations in the local ionization,
as in planetary atmospheres and protoplanetary disks. We show that the field
responds with a characteristic flash-shaped pulse to a conductivity flash of
intermediate intensity. More powerful ionisation events result in smaller
variations of the initial radiation, or in its damping. We show that the
characteristic damping of the response field for high-power initial radiation
carries information about the ionisation flash magnitude and duration. The
duration of the pulse amplification or the damping is consistently shorter for
larger conductivity variations and can be used to evaluate the intensity of the
flash ionisation. Our work suggests that cyclotron emission could be probe
signals for electrification processes inside BD atmosphere.

learning heuristic functions have yielded improvements in performance. One
approach is to use offline learning to learn predictive models from existing
heuristics in a domain dependent manner. These learned models are deployed as
new heuristic functions. The learned models can in turn be tuned online using a
domain independent error correction approach to further enhance their
informativeness. The online tuning approach is domain independent but instance
specific, and contributes to improved performance for individual instances as
planning proceeds. Consequently it is more effective in larger problems.
  In this paper, we mention two approaches applicable in Partial Order Causal
Link (POCL) Planning that is also known as Plan Space Planning. First, we
endeavor to enhance the performance of a POCL planner by giving an algorithm
for supervised learning. Second, we then discuss an online error minimization
approach in POCL framework to minimize the step-error associated with the
offline learned models thus enhancing their informativeness. Our evaluation
shows that the learning approaches scale up the performance of the planner over
standard benchmarks, specially for larger problems.

highly ordered linear step arrays. These steps take the form of a narrow strip
of graphitic silicon. In some cases - specifically, for Si(553)-Au and
Si(557)-Au - a large fraction of the silicon atoms at the exposed edge of this

periodicity of this charge ordering is always commensurate with the structural
periodicity along the step edge and hence leads to highly ordered arrays of

demonstrate theoretically as well as experimentally that the closely related

accounts for these differences. The model also predicts that unintentional
defects and intentional dopants can create local spin moments at Si(hhk)-Au

are adjusted by DFT calculations. For sufficiently long chains a transport band
gap is observed if the double bonds are present, whereas for identical
couplings no band gap opens. The band gap can be observed also in relatively
short chains, if additional edge atoms are absent, which cause strong resonance
peaks within the band gap. The experimental results are in agreement with our

negativity has a simple form. However, the factorability of the ground state in

one-dimensional chain. We find that the entanglement negativity for the integer
quantum Hall states shows an area law behavior. For the entanglement negativity
of two adjacent intervals in a homogeneous one-dimensional gas, we find

emitting blazars observed with Swift/XRT, especially focusing on sources for
which X-ray regime allows to study the low and the high energy ends of the
particle distributions function. Variability studies require simultaneous
coverage, ideally sampling different flux states of each source. This is
achieved using X-ray observations by disentangling the high-energy end of the
synchrotron emission and the low-energy end of the Compton emission, which are
produced by the same electron population. We focused on a sample of 29 TeV
gamma-ray emitting blazars with the best signal-to-noise X-ray observations
collected with Swift/XRT in the energy range of 0.3-10 keV during 10 years of
Swift/XRT operations. We investigate the X-ray spectral shapes and the effects
of different corrections for neutral hydrogen absorption and decompose the
synchrotron and inverse Compton components. In the case of 5 sources (3C 66A,
S5 0716+714, W Comae, 4C +21.35 and BL Lacertae) a superposition of both
components is observed in the X-ray band, permitting simultaneous, time
resolved studies of both ends of the electron distribution. The analysis of
multi-epoch observations revealed that the break energy of X-ray spectrum
varies only by a small factor with flux changes. Flux variability is more
pronounced in the synchrotron domain (high-energy end of the electron
distribution) than in the Compton domain (low energy end of the electron
distribution). The spectral shape of the Compton domain is stable, while the
flux of the synchrotron domain is variable. These changes cannot be described
by simple variations of the cut-off energy, suggesting that the high-energy end
of the electron distribution is not generally well-described by cooling only.

anisotropic triangular lattice is studied by using the determinant quantum
Monte Carlo method. Around half filling, it is found that the increasing
frustration $t'/t$ could change the wave vector of maximum spin correlation

($\pi,\pi$)$\rightarrow$($\pi,\frac{5\pi}{6}$)$\rightarrow$($\frac{5\pi}{6},\frac{5\pi}{6}$)$\rightarrow$
($\frac{2\pi}{3},\frac{2\pi}{3}$), indicating the frustration's remarkable
effect on the magnetism. In the studied filling region <n>=1.0-1.3, the doping
behaves like some kinds of {\it{frustration}}, which destroys the $(\pi,\pi)$
AFM correlation quickly and push the magnetic order to a wide range of the
$(\frac{2\pi}{3},\frac{2\pi}{3})$ $120^{\circ}$ order when the $t'/t$ is large

number of individuals. Since humans are strategic by nature, effective
incentive mechanisms are needed to encourage participation. A popular mechanism
to recruit individuals is through referrals and passive incentives such as
geometric incentive mechanisms used by the winning team in the 2009 DARPA
Network Challenge and in multi level marketing schemes. The effect of such
recruitment schemes on the effort put in by recruited strategic individuals is
not clear. This paper attempts to fill this gap. Given a referral tree and the
direct and passive reward mechanism, we formulate a network game where agents
compete for finishing crowd sensing tasks. We characterize the Nash equilibrium
efforts put in by the agents and derive closed form expressions for the same.
We discover free riding behavior among nodes who obtain large passive rewards.
This work has implications on designing effective recruitment mechanisms for
crowd sourced tasks. For example, usage of geometric incentive mechanisms to
recruit large number of individuals may not result in proportionate effort
because of free riding.

state of a pair of Majorana bound states (MBS) using a tunnel coupled quantum
dot. The dot is coupled to one end of the topological wire but isolated from
any reservoir, and is capacitively coupled to a charge sensor for measurement.
The combined parity of the MBS-dot system is conserved and charge transfer
between the MBS and dot only occurs through resonant tunnelling. Resonance is
controlled by the dot potential through a local gate and by the MBS energy
splitting due to the overlap of the MBS pair wavefunctions. The latter
splitting can be tuned from zero (topologically protected regime) to a finite
value by gate-driven shortening of the topological wire. Simulations show that
the oscillatory nature of the MBS splitting is not a fundamental obstacle to
readout, but requires precise gate control of the MBS spatial position and dot
potential. With experimentally realistic parameters, we find that high-fidelity
parity readout is achievable given nanometer-scale spatial control of the MBS,
and that there is a tradeoff between required precisions of temporal and
spatial control. Use of the scheme to measure the MBS splitting versus
separation would present a clear signature of topological order, and could be
used to test the robustness of this order to spatial motion, a key requirement
in certain schemes for scalable topological qubits. We show how the scheme can
be extended to distinguish valid parity measurements from invalid ones due to
gate calibration errors.

aspects such as AdS/CFT, not phenomena, and are not much interested in testing
theories beyond the Standard Model about our world. Compactified theories
generically have many realistic features whose necessary presence provides some
tests, such as gravity, Yang-Mills forces like the Standard Model ones, chiral

Weyl surface plasmon polariton dispersion is strikingly similar to
magnetoplasmons in ordinary metals. In particular, this implies the existence
of nonreciprocal surface modes. In addition, we obtain the nonretarded Weyl
magnetoplasmon modes, which acquire an additional longitudinal magnetic-field
dependence. These predicted surface plasmon results are observable
manifestations of the chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals and might have
technological applications.

A
sequence of vertices in a graph $G$ is called a total dominating sequence if
every vertex $v$ in the sequence totally dominates at least one vertex that was
not totally dominated by any vertex that precedes $v$ in the sequence, and at
the end all vertices of $G$ are totally dominated. While the length of a
shortest such sequence is the total domination number of $G$, in this paper we
investigate total dominating sequences of maximum length, which we call the
Grundy total domination number, $\gamma_{\rm gr}^t(G)$, of $G$. We provide a
characterization of the graphs $G$ for which $\gamma_{\rm gr}^t(G)=|V(G)|$ and
of those for which $\gamma_{\rm gr}^t(G)=2$. We show that if $T$ is a
nontrivial tree of order~$n$ with no vertex with two or more leaf-neighbors,
then $\gamma_{\rm gr}^t(T) \ge \frac{2}{3}(n+1)$, and characterize the extremal
trees. We also prove that for $k \ge 3$, if $G$ is a connected $k$-regular
graph of order~$n$ different from $K_{k,k}$, then $\gamma_{\rm gr}^t(G) \ge (n
+ \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil - 2)/(k-1)$ if $G$ is not bipartite and
$\gamma_{\rm gr}^t(G) \ge (n + 2\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil - 4)/(k-1)$ if $G$ is
bipartite. The Grundy total domination number is proven to be bounded from
above by two times the Grundy domination number, while the former invariant can
be arbitrarily smaller than the latter. Finally, a natural connection with edge
covering sequences in hypergraphs is established, which in particular yields
the NP-completeness of the decision version of the Grundy total domination
number.

interpret the recent LHC Run-2 results on search for $Z^\prime$ boson resonance

the two results we identify an allowed parameter region for this

interface the algorithm with EFTCAMB and take advantage of the effective field

returning all quantities needed to accurately compare the model with

on the linear growth of cosmic structures. In particular we present the

generally scale dependent in addition to redshift dependent. Finally, we study
the observational implications of the model by comparing its cosmological

making detection of the remaining errors harder. In this paper, we propose
QFix, a framework that derives explanations and repairs for discrepancies in
relational data, by analyzing the effect of queries that operated on the data

scenarios where only a subset of the true discrepancies is known, and robust to
different types of update workloads. We make four important contributions: (a)
we formalize the problem of diagnosing the causes of data errors based on the
queries that operated on and introduced errors to a dataset; (b) we develop
exact methods for deriving diagnoses and fixes for identified errors using
state-of-the-art tools; (c) we present several optimization techniques that
improve our basic approach without compromising accuracy, and (d) we leverage a
tradeoff between accuracy and performance to scale diagnosis to large datasets

effectiveness of QFix through extensive evaluation over benchmark and synthetic

investigate the properties and evolution of protoplanetary disks around young
stars, where the initial conditions for the growth of planets are set. Our goal
is to study grain growth in the disk of the young, intermediate mass star
HD163296 where dust processing has already been observed, and to look for
evidence of growth by ice condensation across the CO snowline, already
identified in this disk with ALMA. Under the hypothesis of optically thin
emission we compare images at different wavelengths from ALMA and VLA to
measure the opacity spectral index across the disk and thus the maximum grain
size. We also use a Bayesian tool based on a two-layer disk model to fit the
observations and constrain the dust surface density. The measurements of the
opacity spectral index indicate the presence of large grains and pebbles
($\geq$1 cm) in the inner regions of the disk (inside $\sim$50 AU) and smaller
grains, consistent with ISM sizes, in the outer disk (beyond 150 AU).
Re-analysing ALMA Band 7 Science Verification data we find (radially)
unresolved excess continuum emission centered near the location of the CO
snowline at $\sim$90 AU. Our analysis suggests a grain size distribution
consistent with an enhanced production of large grains at the CO snowline and
consequent transport to the inner regions. Our results combined with the excess
in infrared scattered light found by Garufi et al. (2014) suggests the presence
of a structure at 90~AU involving the whole vertical extent of the disk. This
could be evidence for small scale processing of dust at the CO snowline.

with a spectral resolving power of 120 at 3.6 micron, is found to be
contaminated by second-order light at wavelengths longer than 4.9 micron which
is especially serious for red objects. First, we present the wavelength
calibration considering the refractive index of the grism as a function of the
wavelength for the first time. We find that the previous solution is positively
shifted by up to 0.01 micron compared with the revised wavelengths at 2.5--5.0
micron. In addition, we demonstrate that second-order contamination occurs even
with a perfect order-sorting filter owing to the wavelength dependence of the
refractive index. Second, the spectral responses of the system from the first-
and second-order light are simultaneously obtained from two types of standard
objects with different colors. The response from the second-order light
suggests leakage of the order-sorting filter below 2.5 micron. The relations
between the output of the detector and the intensities of the first- and
second-order light are formalized by a matrix equation that combines the two
orders. The removal of the contaminating second-order light can be achieved by
solving the matrix equation. The new calibration extends the available spectral
coverage of the grism mode from 4.9 micron up to 5.0 micron. The revision can
be used to study spectral features falling in these extended wavelengths, e.g.,

model that includes a physically and observationally motivated treatment of
binaries (the BPASS model). Binary mass transfer and mergers enhance the
population of massive stars at late times (>3 Myr) after star formation, which
in turn strongly enhances the late-time ionizing photon production (especially
at low metallicities). These photons are produced after feedback from massive
stars has carved escape channels in the ISM, and so efficiently leak out of
galaxies. As a result, the time-averaged ""effective"" escape fraction (ratio of

the steady-state structures of the photoevaporative winds by coupling
temperature estimates obtained with a PDR code with 1D radial hydrodynamical

final mass loss rates. We find that these winds are much more significant than
have been appreciated hitherto when grain growth is included in the modelling:
in particular, mass loss rates > 1e-8 M_sun/yr are predicted even for modest
background field strengths ( ~ 30 G_0) in the case of discs that extend to R >
150 AU. Grain growth significantly affects the final mass loss rates by
reducing the average cross section at FUV wavelengths, and thus allowing a much
more vigorous flow. The radial profiles of observable quantities (in particular
surface density, temperature and velocity patterns) indicate that these winds
have characteristic features that are now potentially observable with ALMA. In
particular, such discs should have extended gaseous emission that is dust

GeV are the cause of great excitement and hope. We show that a pseudoscalar
axion coupled to the topological density of hypercharge, suggested in the past
by Brustein and Oaknin as a candidate for inducing baryogenesis, can explain
the signal in the diphoton channel. The hypercharge axion (HCA) can also decay
to $Z\gamma$ and $ZZ$. The expected number of events in these channels is too
small to have been detected, but such decays should be observed in the future.
The HCA can be produced via vector boson fusion (VBF) or via associated
production (AP). The latter should be manifested by a characteristic decay to 3
photons which should be observed soon. We adapt the previous analysis of
possible detection of the HCA at the LHC by Brustein and Oaknin and by Elfgren
to the case that the mass of the HCA is 750 GeV and find the expected cross
section and decay width in terms of the HCA coupling. We find that the expected
cross-section fits well the observed number of excess events and that there is
tension between the measured cross-section and the reported partial decay
width. The tension is caused because for both VBF and AP the production
cross-section and the decay width depend linearly on each other. We therefore
expect that if the new resonance is indeed the HCA, either its width should be
significantly smaller than the reported width or the production cross-section
should be significantly higher than the reported one.

dust-corrected star-formation rate (SFR) of 4.7$\pm$0.2 Msun/yr, with no
companion down to 0.22 Msun/yr (5 $\sigma$) within 240 kpc (30""). Using a
high-resolution spectrum (UVES) of the background quasar, which is fortuitously
aligned with the galaxy major axis (with an azimuth angle $\alpha$ of only
$15^\circ$), we find, in the gas kinematics traced by low-ionization lines,
distinct signatures consistent with those expected for a ""cold flow disk""
extending at least 12 kpc ($3\times R_{1/2}$). We estimate the mass accretion

a detailed analysis of the low-ionization lines (e.g. ZnII, CrII, TiII, MnII,

comparable to the galaxy metallicity ($12+\log \rm O/H=8.7\pm0.2$), implying a
large recycling fraction from past outflows. Blue-shifted MgII and FeII

Locally-Supervised Deep Hybrid Model (LS-DHM) that effectively enhances and
explores the convolutional features for scene recognition. Firstly, we notice
that the convolutional features capture local objects and fine structures of
scene images, which yield important cues for discriminating ambiguous scenes,
whereas these features are significantly eliminated in the highly-compressed FC
representation. Secondly, we propose a new Local Convolutional Supervision
(LCS) layer to enhance the local structure of the image by directly propagating
the label information to the convolutional layers. Thirdly, we propose an
efficient Fisher Convolutional Vector (FCV) that successfully rescues the
orderless mid-level semantic information (e.g. objects and textures) of scene
image. The FCV encodes the large-sized convolutional maps into a fixed-length
mid-level representation, and is demonstrated to be strongly complementary to
the high-level FC-features. Finally, both the FCV and FC-features are
collaboratively employed in the LSDHM representation, which achieves
outstanding performance in our experiments. It obtains 83.75% and 67.56%

the slope of the faint end of the luminosity distribution of the HCS red

We find that the most massive HCS clusters host a population of bright red
sequence galaxies at $M_V < -22.0$ mag, which are not observed in low-mass
clusters. Interestingly, we also note the presence of a population of very
bright ($M_V < -23.0$ mag) and massive (${\log(M_*/M_\odot)} > 11.5$) red

transport. This paper outlines a simple, efficient numerical model of
stochastic saltation, which is validated against previously published
experimental data on saltation in a channel of nearly horizontal bed.
Convergence tests are systematically applied to ensure the model is free from
statistical errors emanating from the number of particle hops considered. Two
criteria for statistical convergence are derived; according to the first
criterion, at least $10^3$ hops appear to be necessary for convergent results,
whereas $10^4$ saltations seem to be the minimum required in order to achieve
statistical convergence in accordance with the second criterion. Two empirical
formulae for lift force are considered: one dependent on the slip (relative)
velocity of the particle multiplied by the vertical gradient of the horizontal
flow velocity component; the other dependent on the difference between the
squares of the slip velocity components at the top and bottom of the particle.
The former is found to give more stable results. A parameter study indicates
that the saltation length has a minimum value with increasing particle diameter
(at non-dimensional $D_* \sim 12$) for a given transport stage. Variations in
the friction coefficient and collision line level have negligible effect on the
saltation statistics within the ranges considered. Regression equations are
obtained for each of the saltation characteristics. Finally, the model is used
to evaluate the bed load transport rate, which is in satisfactory agreement
with common formulae based on flume data, especially when compared against
other saltation-derived expressions.

structure of both Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire modes. For arbitrary Reynolds
numbers Re, this transformation allows the solution of the initial-value
problem for an arbitrary three-dimensional (3D) disturbance via a
two-dimensional (2D) initial-value problem at a smaller Reynolds number Re2D.
Its implications for the transient growth of arbitrary 3D disturbances is
studied. Using the Squire transformation, the general solution of the
initial-value problem is shown to predict large-Reynolds-number scaling for the
optimal gain at all optimization times t with t/Re finite or large. This result
is an extension of the well-known scaling laws first obtained by Gustavsson (J.
Fluid Mech., vol. 224, 1991, pp. 241-260) and Reddy & Henningson (J. Fluid
Mech., vol. 252, 1993, pp. 209-238) for arbitrary \alpha Re, where \alpha is
the streamwise wavenumber. The Squire transformation is also extended to the
adjoint problem and, hence, the adjoint Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire modes. It is,
thus, demonstrated that the long-time optimal growth of 3D perturbations as
given by the exponential growth (or decay) of the leading eigenmode times an
extra gain representing its receptivity, may be decomposed as a product of the
gains arising from purely 2D mechanisms and an analytical contribution
representing 3D growth mechanisms equal to 1+(\beta Re/Re2D)2G, where \beta is
the spanwise wavenumber and G is a known expression. For example, when the
leading eigenmode is an Orr-Sommerfeld mode, it is given by the product of
respective gains from the 2D Orr mechanism and an analytical expression
representing the 3D lift-up mechanism. Whereas if the leading eigenmode is a
Squire mode, the extra gain is shown to be solely due to the 3D lift-up
mechanism.

central character of the inducing irreducible cuspidal representation is
dominated in an appropriate way by the square root of the modular character of
minimal parabolic subgroup. For representations supported by fixed parabolic
subgroup, a more precise bound is given. There are also bounds for specific
Bernstein components. A number of these upper bounds are best possible.
  The second part of the paper addresses a question how far is the trivial
representation from the rest of the unramified automorphic dual. By a result of
L. Clozel, trivial representation is isolated in the automorphic dual of a
split rank one semisimple group over a completion of a global field, but it is
very seldom isolated in the unitary dual (it can happen only in the archimedes
cases). Further, the level of isolation in the case of SL(2) is important for
the number theory. For the higher rank groups, the trivial representation is
always isolated in the unitary dual by an old result of D. Kazhdan. Still, we
may ask if the level of isolation is higher in the case of the automorphic
duals. We show that the answer is negative to this question for symplectic

circuit outputs a bit string x obtained by measuring some subset of w qubits.
Two simulation tasks are considered: (1) computing the probability of a given

shown that these tasks can be solved on a classical computer in time

verification tool for medium-size quantum computations that are dominated by
Clifford gates. The main ingredient of both algorithms is a subroutine for
approximating the norm of an n-qubit state which is given as a linear
combination of $\chi$ stabilizer states. The subroutine runs in time $\chi n^3

Liouville identity we obtain an inverse conductivity problem. Its discrete
analogue is to find a resistor network that matches the measurements, and is
well understood. Here we show how to use a discrete Liouville identity to
transform its solution to that of Schr\""odinger's problem. The discrete
Schr\""odinger potential given by the discrete Liouville identity can be used to
reconstruct the potential in the continuum in two ways. First, we can obtain a
direct but coarse reconstruction by interpreting the values of the discrete
Schr\""odinger potential as averages of the continuum Schr\""odinger potential on
a special sensitivity grid. Second, the discrete Schr\""odinger potential may be
used to reformulate the conventional nonlinear output least squares
optimization formulation of the inverse Schr\""odinger problem. Instead of
minimizing the boundary measurement misfit, we minimize the misfit between the
discrete Schr\""odinger potentials. This results in a better behaved
optimization problem that converges in a single Gauss-Newton iteration, and
gives good quality reconstructions of the potential, as illustrated by the
numerical results.

Any disturbance on the gas-liquid interface grows into a Kelvin-Helmholtz wave,
and the wave crest forms a thin liquid film that flaps as the wave grows
downstream. Increasing the gas speed, it is observed that the film breaks up
into droplets which are eventually thrown into the gas stream at large angles.
In a flow where most of the momentum is in the horizontal direction, it is
surprising to observe these large ejection angles. Our experiments and
simulations show that a recirculation region grows downstream of the wave and
leads to vortex shedding similar to the wake of a backward-facing step. The
ejection mechanism results from the interaction between the liquid film and the
vortex shedding sequence: a recirculation zone appears in the wake of the wave
and a liquid film emerges from the wave crest; the recirculation region
detaches into a vortex and the gas flow over the wave momentarily reattaches
due to the departure of the vortex; this reattached flow pushes the liquid film
down; by now, a new recirculation vortex is being created in the wake of the
wave - just where the liquid film is now located; the liquid film is blown up
from below by the newly formed recirculation vortex in a manner similar to a
bag-breakup event; the resulting droplets are catapulted by the recirculation

found that the inclusion of the tensor couplings of vector mesons $\omega$ and
$\rho$ can slightly increase the maximum mass of neutron stars. In addition,
the results indicate that the tensor couplings of vector mesons $\omega$ and
$\rho$ lead to obvious enhancement of the total neutrino emissivity for the
nucleonic direct URCA processes, which must accelerate the cooling rate of the
non-superfluid neutron star matter. However, when considering only the tensor
coupling of vector meson $\rho$, the neutrino emissivity for the nucleonic
direct URCA processes slightly declines at low densities and significantly
increases at high densities.That is to say that the tensor coupling of vector
meson $\rho$ leads to the slow cooling rate of a low-mass neutron star and
rapid cooling rate of a massive neutron star.

host star is a bright ($V=11.04$, $K_s = 9.37$), slightly metal poor

K2 photometry and HARPS radial velocities reveal that the planet is in a
$\approx 42$ day orbit around its host star, has a radius of
$2.23^{+0.14}_{-0.11}R_\oplus$, and a mass of $16.3^{+6.0}_{-6.1}M_\oplus$.
Although the data at hand puts the planet in the region of the mass-radius
diagram where we could expect planets with a pure rock (i.e. magnesium
silicate) composition using two-layer models (i.e., between rock/iron and
rock/ice compositions), we discuss more realistic three-layer composition
models which can explain the high density of the discovered exoplanet. The fact
that the planet lies in the boundary between ""possibly rocky"" and ""non-rocky""
exoplanets, makes it an interesting planet for future RV follow-up.

gradient on the transient growth phenomenon of plane Poiseuille flow and plane
Couette flow is presented. Only the streamwise-uniform and nearly
streamwise-uniform disturbances are highly influenced by the Rayleigh number Ra
and Prandtl number Pr. The maximum optimal transient growth G max of
streamwise-uniform disturbances increases slowly with increasing Ra and
decreasing Pr. For all Ra and Pr, at moderately large Reynolds numbersRe, the
supremum of G max is always attained for streamwise-uniform perturbations (or
nearly streamwise-uniform perturbations, in the case of plane Couette flow)
which produce large streamwise streaks and Rayleigh-B\'enard convection rolls
(RB). The optimal growth curves retain the same large-Reynolds-number scaling
as in pure shear flow. A 3D vector model of the governing equations
demonstrates that the short-time behavior is governed by the classical lift-up
mechanism and that the influence of Ra on this mechanism is secondary and
negligible. The optimal input for the largest long-time response is given by
the adjoint of the dominant eigenmode with respect to the energy scalar
product: the RBeigenmode without its streamwise velocity component. These
short-time and long-time responses depict, to leading order, the optimal
transient growth G(t). At moderately large Ra (or small Pr at a fixed Ra), the
dominant adjoint mode is a good approximation to the optimal initial condition
for all time. Over a general class of norms that can be considered as growth
functions, the results remain qualitatively similar, for example, the dominant
adjoint eigenmode still approximates the maximum optimal response.

computation of the given norm. This extends to convex functions satisfying a
polynomial growth condition: for such a given function, computation of its
Fenchel dual/conjugate is polynomial-time reducible to computation of the given
function. Hence the computation of a norm or a convex function of
polynomial-growth is NP-hard if and only if the computation of its dual norm or
Fenchel dual is NP-hard. We discuss implications of these results on the weak
membership problem for a symmetric convex body and its polar dual, the
polynomial approximability of Mahler volume, and the weak membership problem
for the epigraph of a convex function with polynomial growth and that of its
Fenchel dual.

building footprints from 2D maps and street level images, to derive valuable
information that is generally difficult to acquire -- building heights and
building facade masks in images. Building footprints are elevated in world
coordinates and projected onto images. Building heights are estimated by
scoring projected footprints based on their alignment with building features in
images. Building footprints with estimated heights can be converted to simple
3D building models, which are projected back to images to identify buildings.
In this procedure, accurate camera projections are critical. However, camera
position errors inherited from external sensors commonly exist, which adversely
affect results. We derive a solution to precisely locate cameras on maps using
correspondence between image features and building footprints. Experiments on
real-world datasets show the promise of our method.

galactic nuclei (AGNs) with supermassive BHs. Here we report on the detection
of a possible X-ray QPO signal with a period of 3800\,s at a confidence level
$>99.99\%$ in the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy (NLS1) 1H~0707-495 in one data
set in 0.2-10\,keV taken with {\it XMM-Newton}. The statistical significance is
higher than that of most previously reported QPOs in AGNs. The QPO is highly
coherent (quality factor $Q=\nu/\Delta\nu \geqslant 15$) with a high rms
fractional variability ($\sim15\%$). A comprehensive analysis of the optical
spectra of this AGN is also performed, yielding a central BH mass
$5.2\times10^6\,M_{\odot}$ from the broad emission lines based on the scaling
relation. The QPO follows closely the known frequency-BH mass relation, which
spans from stellar-mass to supermassive BHs. The absence of the QPO in other
observations of the object suggests it a transient phenomenon. We suggest that
the (high-frequency) QPOs tend to occur in highly accreting BH systems, from
BHXBs to supermassive BHs. Future precise estimation of the BH mass may be used
to infer the BH spin from the QPO frequency.

nullified, providing true affine-invariant coordinates which we then utilize to
recover correspondences via simple nearest neighbor relations. The resulting
GrassGraph algorithm is empirically shown to work well in non-ideal scenarios
with noise, outliers, and occlusions. Our validation benchmarks use an
unprecedented 440,000+ experimental trials performed on 2D and 3D datasets,
with a variety of parameter settings and competing methods. State-of-the-art
performance in the majority of these extensive evaluations confirm the utility

many vision tasks involving structured predictions. Here we propose a
fully-connected deep continuous CRF model for both discrete and continuous
labelling problems. We exemplify the usefulness of the proposed model on
multi-class semantic labelling (discrete) and the robust depth estimation
(continuous) problems.
  In our framework, we model both the unary and the pairwise potential
functions as deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are jointly
learned in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed method possesses the main
advantage of continuously-valued CRF, which is a closed-form solution for the
Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference.
  To better adapt to different tasks, instead of using the commonly employed
maximum likelihood CRF parameter learning protocol, we propose task-specific
loss functions for learning the CRF parameters.
  It enables direct optimization of the quality of the MAP estimates during the
course of learning.
  Specifically, we optimize the multi-class classification loss for the
semantic labelling task and the Turkey's biweight loss for the robust depth
estimation problem.
  Experimental results on the semantic labelling and robust depth estimation
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method compare favorably against both
baseline and state-of-the-art methods.
  In particular, we show that although the proposed deep CRF model is
continuously valued, with the equipment of task-specific loss, it achieves
impressive results even on discrete labelling tasks.

Coulomb potential. Induced vacuum charge density is calculated and analyzed at
the subcritical and supercritical Coulomb potentials for massless and massive
fermions. For the massless case the induced vacuum charge density is localized
at the origin when the Coulomb center charge is subcritical while it has a
power-law tail when the Coulomb center charge is supercritical. The finite mass
contribution into the induced charge due to the vacuum polarization is small
and insignificantly distorts the Coulomb potential only at distances of order
of the Compton length. The induced vacuum charge has a screening sign. As is
known the quantum electrodynamics vacuum becomes unstable when the Coulomb
center charge is increased from subcritical to supercritical values. In the
supercritical Coulomb potential the quantum electrodynamics vacuum acquires the
charge due to the so-called real vacuum polarization. We calculate the real
vacuum polarization charge density. Screening of the Coulomb center charge are
briefly discussed. We expect that our results will be helpful for more deep

answered in $O(\tau)$ time. However, the construction time for all
deterministic versions of their data structure is quadratic in $n$. In this
paper, we propose a deterministic solution that achieves a similar space-time
trade-off of $O(\tau\min\{\log\tau,\log\frac{n}{\tau}\})$ query time using

carrier. We discuss the boiling crisis, a transition between two regimes of
boiling: nucleate and film boiling. The boiling crisis results in a sharp
decrease in the heat transfer rate, which can cause a major accident in
industrial heat exchangers. In this communication, we present a physical model
of the boiling crisis based on the vapor recoil effect. Under the action of the
vapor recoil the gas bubbles begin to spread over the heater thus forming a
germ for the vapor film. The vapor recoil force not only causes its spreading,
it also creates a strong adhesion to the heater that prevents the bubble
departure, thus favoring the further spreading. Near the liquid-gas critical
point, the bubble growth is very slow and allows the kinetics of the bubble
spreading to be observed. Since the surface tension is very small in this
regime, only microgravity conditions can preserve a convex bubble shape. In the
experiments both in the Mir space station and in the magnetic levitation
facility, we directly observed an increase of the apparent contact angle and
spreading of the dry spot under the bubble. Numerical simulations of the
thermally controlled bubble growth show this vapor recoil effect too thus
confirming our model of the boiling crisis.

donors reinforces contagion. We find that the diffusion of donations is driven
by independent reinforcement contagion: people are more likely to donate when
exposed to donors from different social groups than when they are exposed to
equally many donors from the same group. Counter-intuitively, being exposed to
one side may increase donations to the other side. Although the effect is weak,
simultaneous cross-cutting exposure makes donation somewhat less likely.
Finally, the independence of donors in the beginning of a campaign predicts the
amount of money that is raised throughout a campaign. We theorize that people
infer population-wide estimates from their local observations, with elites
assessing the viability of candidates, possibly opposing candidates in response
to local support. Our findings suggest that theories of complex contagions need
refinement and that political campaigns should target multiple communities.

mass of 0.73 +/- 0.04 Mjup, and a radius of 1.19 +/- 0.02 Rjup. The host star
is a relatively bright (V=12.5) G7 dwarf with a nearby K5V companion. Based on
stellar rotation and the abundance of Lithium, we find that the system might be
as young as about 450 Myr. The observation of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect
shows the planet is aligned with respect to the stellar spin. Given the deep
transit (20mmag), the magnitude of the star and the presence of a nearby

transmission spectroscopy, in particular in the near-infrared where the both
stars are relatively bright.

transport approaches do not describe the collapse of directed flow below

simulates effects of a softening of the equation of state, well describes the

the system reaches high baryon density state, is needed to explain the observed
collapse of proton directed flow within a hadronic transport approach.

different length and time scales[1, 2]. The microscopic origin of friction is
poorly understood, due in part to a lack of methods for measuring the force on
a nanometer-scale asperity sliding at velocity of the order of cm/s.[3, 4]
Despite enormous advance in experimental techniques[5], this combination of
small length scale and high velocity remained illusive. Here we present a
technique for rapidly measuring the frictional forces on a single asperity (an
AFM tip) over a velocity range from zero to several cm/s. At each image pixel
we obtain the velocity dependence of both conservative and dissipative forces,
revealing the transition from stick-slip to a smooth sliding friction[1, 6]. We
explain measurements on graphite using a modified Prandtl-Tomlinson model that
takes into account the damped elastic deformation of the asperity. With its
greatly improved force sensitivity and very small sliding amplitude, our method
enables rapid and detailed surface mapping of the full velocity-dependence of
frictional forces with less than 10~nm spatial resolution.

selected galaxies that were likely to belong to the red sequence, and hence to
be at the cluster redshift, and built density maps. By computing the background
for each map and drawing 3sigma contours, we estimated the elongations of the

clear elongations in twelve clusters, with sizes reaching up to 7.6 Mpc. Eleven
other clusters have neighbouring structures, but the zones linking them are not
detected in the density maps at a 3sigma level. Three clusters show no extended

efficiency for future green communications. However, in massive SM-MIMO, the
optimal maximum likelihood (ML) detector has the prohibitively high complexity,
while state-of-the-art low-complexity detectors for conventional small-scale
SM-MIMO suffer from an obvious performance loss. In this paper, by exploiting
the structured sparsity of multiple SM signals, we propose a low-complexity
signal detector based on structured compressive sensing (SCS) to improve the
signal detection performance. Specifically, we first propose the grouped
transmission scheme at the transmitter, where multiple SM signals in several
continuous time slots are grouped to carry the common spatial constellation
symbol to introduce the desired structured sparsity. Accordingly, a structured
subspace pursuit (SSP) algorithm is proposed at the receiver to jointly detect
multiple SM signals by leveraging the structured sparsity. In addition, we also
propose the SM signal interleaving to permute SM signals in the same
transmission group, whereby the channel diversity can be exploited to further
improve the signal detection performance. Theoretical analysis quantifies the
performance gain from SM signal interleaving, and simulation results
demonstrate the near-optimal performance of the proposed scheme.

power law finite time singular form of the crash hazard rate in the

based on a percolation picture of the network of traders and the concept that
clusters of connected traders share the same opinion. The key ingredient is the
notion that a shift of position from buyer to seller of a sufficiently large
group of traders can trigger a crash. This provides a formula to estimate the
crash hazard rate by summation over percolation clusters above a minimum size
of a power sa (with a > 1) of the cluster sizes s, similarly to a generalized
percolation susceptibility. The power sa of cluster sizes emerges from the
super-linear dependence of group activity as a function of group size,
previously documented in the literature. The crash hazard rate exhibits
explosive finite-time singular behaviors when the control parameter (fraction
of occupied sites, or density of traders in the network) approaches the
percolation threshold pc. Realistic dynamics are generated by modelling the
density of traders on the percolation network by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,
whose memory controls the spontaneous excursion of the control parameter close
to the critical region of bubble formation. Our numerical simulations recover
the main stylized properties of the JLS model with intermittent explosive

sources for ground-based detectors, and gravitational waves from black
hole-neutron star mergers are expected to be detected in the next few years.
Simultaneous detection of electromagnetic counterparts with gravitational-wave
detection provides rich information about the merger events. Among the possible
electromagnetic counterparts from the black hole-neutron star merger, the
emission powered by the decay of radioactive r-process nuclei, so called
kilonova/macronova, is one of the best targets for follow-up observation. We
derive fitting formulas for the mass and the velocity of ejecta from a generic
black hole-neutron star merger based on recently performed numerical relativity
simulations. We combined these fitting formulas with a new semi-analytic model
for a black hole-neutron star kilonova/macronova lightcurve which reproduces
the results of radiation-transfer simulations. Specifically, the semi-analytic
model reproduces the result of each band magnitude obtained by the radiation
transfer simulations within ~1 mag. By using this semi-analytic model, we found
that, at 400 Mpc, the kilonova/macronova is as bright as 22-24 mag for the
cases with a small chirp mass and a high black hole spin, and >28 mag for a
large chirp mass and a low black hole spin. We also apply our model to
GRB130603B as an illustration, and show that a black hole-neutron star merger
with a rapidly spinning black hole and a large neutron star radius is favored.

the majority of research has introduced sparsity through the limited L1 or

networks have been found to express either Pareto, or more recently discovered,
Log Normal distributions. Employing the convexity-inducing Lovasz Extension, we
demonstrate how incorporating specific degree distribution information can lead
to large scale improvements in Matrix Completion based Link prediction. We

about volatile oil prices during the last decade have renewed the public
interest in predictions for the near future oil production and consumption.
Unfortunately, studies from only 10 years ago, which tried to forecast the oil
production during the next 20-30 years, failed to make accurate predictions for
today's global oil production and consumption. Forecasts using economic growth
scenarios, overestimated the actual oil production, while models which tried to
estimate the maximum future oil production/year, using the official country oil
reserve data, predicted a too low production.
  In this paper, a new approach to model the maximal future regional and thus
global oil production (part I) and consumption (part II) during the next
decades is proposed.
  Our analysis of the regional oil production data during past decades shows
that, in contrast to periods when production was growing and growth rates
varied greatly from one country to another, remarkable similarities are found
during the plateau and decline periods of different countries. Following this
model, the particular production phase of each major oil producing country and
region is determined essentially only from the recent past oil production data.
Using these data, the model is then used to predict the production from all
major oil producing countries, regions and continents up to the year 2050. The
limited regional and global potential to compensate this decline with
unconventional oil and oil-equivalents is also presented.

undergoes a dramatic evolution caused, in part, by the changes in the

on the detected signal and proposes methods to mitigate them especially in the
case of the ""unchopped"" mode. Since transients can arise from a variety of
causes, we classified them in three main categories: transients caused by
sudden variations of the continuum due to the observational mode used;
transients caused by cosmic ray impacts on the detectors; transients caused by
a continuous smooth variation of the continuum during a wavelength scan. We
propose a method to disentangle these effects and treat them separately. In
particular, we show that a linear combination of three exponential functions is
needed to fit the response variation of the detectors during a transient. An
algorithm to detect, fit, and correct transient effects is presented. The
solution proposed to correct the signal for the effects of transients
substantially improves the quality of the final reduction with respect to the
standard methods used for archival reduction in the case where transient
effects are most pronounced. The programs developed to implement the

The supergiant optical companion produces a strong radiatively-driven stellar
wind, which is accreted onto the neutron star producing highly variable X-ray
emission. A complex phenomenology, due to both gravitational and radiative
effects, needs to be taken into account in order to reproduce orbital spectral
variations. We have investigated the spectral and light curve properties of the
X-ray emission from Vela X-1 along the binary orbit. These studies allow to
constrain the stellar wind properties and its perturbations induced by the
compact object. We took advantage of the All Sky Monitor MAXI/GSC data to
analyze Vela X-1 spectra and light curves. By studying the orbital profiles in
the $4-10$ and $10-20$ keV energy bands, we extracted a sample of orbital light
curves (${\sim}15$% of the total) showing a dip around the inferior
conjunction, i.e., a double-peaked shape. We analyzed orbital phase-averaged
and phase-resolved spectra of both the double-peaked and the standard sample.
The dip in the double-peaked sample needs $N_H\sim2\times10^{24}\,$cm$^{-2}$ to
be explained by absorption solely, which is not observed in our analysis. We
show how Thomson scattering from an extended and ionized accretion wake can
contribute to the observed dip. Fitted by a cutoff power-law model, the two
analyzed samples show orbital modulation of the photon index, hardening by
${\sim}0.3$ around the inferior conjunction, compared to earlier and later
phases, hinting a likely inadequacy of this model. On the contrary, including a
partial covering component at certain orbital phase bins allows a constant
photon index along the orbital phases, indicating a highly inhomogeneous
environment. We discuss our results in the framework of possible scenarios.

order (light-signal clock synchronization). Particle tracking in the lab frame
usually treats time as an independent variable. Then, the evolution of electron
beams is treated according to the absolute time convention (non-standard clock
synchronization). This point has never received attention in the accelerator
community. There are two ways of coupling fields and particles. The first,
Lorentz's way, consists in `translating' Maxwell's electrodynamics to the
absolute time world-picture. The second, Einstein's way, consists in
`translating' particle tracking results to the electromagnetic world-picture.
Conventional particle tracking shows that the electron beam direction changes
after a transverse kick, while the orientation of the microbunching fronts
stays unvaried. We show that under Einstein's time order, in the
ultrarelativistic asymptote the orientation of the planes of simultaneity is
always perpendicular to the electron beam velocity. This allows for the
production of coherent undulator radiation from a modulated electron beam in
the kicked direction without suppression. We hold a recent FEL study at the
LCLS as experimental evidence of microbunching wavefront readjusting after a
large kick. In a previous paper we quantitatively described this result
invoking the aberration of light, corresponding to Lorentz's way of coupling
fields and particles. Here we give details of the Lorentz's approach used in
that paper. We also demonstrate that an `inverse translation' of particle
tracking results to the standard time order resolves puzzles related with the
strong qualitative disagreement between simulations and experiments. Previous
simulation results in ultrarelativistic electron beam physics should be
reexamined in the light of the difference between particle tracking and
electromagnetic world-pictures.

frequency bands may be associated with different processes while working memory
tasks are performed. There are three well-known relationships between working
memory processes and specific frequency bands of subcortical oscillations,
namely: the storage of new information which correlates positively with
beta/gamma-frequency band oscillations, the maintenance of information while
ignoring irrelevant stimulation which is directly linked to theta-frequency
band oscillations, and the clearance of memory which is associated with
alpha-frequency band oscillations. Although these relationships between working
memory processes and subcortical background oscillations have been observed, a
full explanation of these phenomena is still needed. This paper will aid
understanding of the working memory's operation and phase switching by
proposing a novel and biophysical realistic mathematical-computational
framework which unifies the generation of subcortical background oscillations,
the role of basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits and the influence of

exoplanet formation models as well as for planetary atmosphere models. But this
can be challenging because of the planet-to-star small angular separation and
high flux ratio. Recently, optimized instruments like SPHERE and GPI were
installed on 8m-class telescopes. These will probe young gazeous exoplanets at
large separations (~1au) but, because of uncalibrated aberrations that induce
speckles in the coronagraphic images, they are not able to detect older and
fainter planets. There are always aberrations that are slowly evolving in time.
They create quasi-static speckles that cannot be calibrated a posteriori with
sufficient accuracy. An active correction of these speckles is thus needed to
reach very high contrast levels (>1e7). This requires a focal plane wavefront
sensor. Our team proposed the SCC, the performance of which was demonstrated in
the laboratory. As for all focal plane wavefront sensors, these are sensitive
to chromatism and we propose an upgrade that mitigates the chromatism effects.
First, we recall the principle of the SCC and we explain its limitations in
polychromatic light. Then, we present and numerically study two upgrades to
mitigate chromatism effects: the optical path difference method and the
multireference self-coherent camera. Finally, we present laboratory tests of
the latter solution.
  We demonstrate in the laboratory that the MRSCC camera can be used as a focal
plane wavefront sensor in polychromatic light using an 80 nm bandwidth at 640
nm. We reach a performance that is close to the chromatic limitations of our
bench: contrast of 4.5e-8 between 5 and 17 lambda/D.
  The performance of the MRSCC is promising for future high-contrast imaging
instruments that aim to actively minimize the speckle intensity so as to detect
and spectrally characterize faint old or light gaseous planets.

built a brushless generator that simulates a homogenised magnetic field and
should theoretically be usable without semiconductors and electronic

ensures the disruption of the theoretical balance of electromotive voltage
generation. In the Faraday homopolar generator, the imbalance of the
electromotive voltage is secured by fixing the disk to the reference set of
rotating magnets. However, the solution of the technical problem initiated a
theoretical problem. The result of the experiment suggests that the current
concept of electrodynamics, based on magnetic flux using relativistic
principles, is Euclidean, idealised. If we continue to persist in the
unconditional correctness of Maxwell's concept, we would have to admit that the
inhomogeneous field can be screened out of the perspective of any external
reference system, but that for a homogeneous magnetic field such a reference
system would not exist. A good explanation of the inconsistency with
theoretical expectations gives us the introduction of energy levels of the
magnetic field, which are measurable and are probably a macroscopic
manifestation of the summation of levels from elementary particle environments.
Part of this article is an analysis which shows that current electrodynamics
use a simplified view of the vector of induction. We show that the induction is
a special case of a more general, topological evaluation of the properties of
the set of magnetic field vectors. This unavoidably leads to a narrowing of
Faraday's Law, which improves the experimental prediction and paradoxically
reveals considerable technical potential. Both concepts can coexist in
practice, with a wide range of value matches.

double-lined spectroscopic binary system of intermediate-mass, using
high-resolution spectropolarimetric Narval observations of HD 5550. We first
fit the intensity spectra using Zeeman/ATLAS9 LTE synthetic spectra to estimate
the effective temperatures, microturbulent velocities, and the abundances of
some elements of both components, as well as the light-ratio of the system. We
then fit the least-square deconvolved $I$ profiles to determine the radial and
projected rotational velocities of both stars. We then analysed the shape and
evolution of the LSD $V$ profiles using the oblique rotator model to
characterise the magnetic fields of both stars.
  We confirm the Ap nature of the primary, previously reported in the
literature, and find that the secondary displays spectral characteristics
typical of an Am star. While a magnetic field is clearly detected in the lines
of the primary, no magnetic field is detected in the secondary, in any of our
observation. If a dipolar field were present at the surface of the Am star, its
polar strength must be below 40 G. The faint variability observed in the Stokes
$V$ profiles of the Ap star allowed us to propose a rotation period of
$6.84_{-0.39}^{+0.61}$ d, close to the orbital period ($\sim$6.82 d),
suggesting that the star is synchronised with its orbit. By fitting the
variability of the $V$ profiles, we propose that the Ap component hosts a
dipolar field inclined with the rotation axis at an angle $\beta=156\pm17$
$^{\circ}$ and a polar strength $B_{\rm d}=65 \pm 20$ G. The field strength is
the weakest known for an Ap star.

classical conditioning paradigms and models, which have been thoroughly
investigated in the last century. On the contrary, limited attention has been
paid to the revaluation of an unconditioned stimulus (UCS), which, as
experimentally observed by various researchers in the last four decades, occurs
out of classical conditioning. For this reason, no analytical or quantitative
theory has been developed for this phenomenon and its dynamics. Unluckily,
models based on classical conditioning are unable to explain or predict
important psychophysiological phenomena, such as the failure of the extinction
of emotional responses in certain circumstances. In this manuscript an
analytical representation of UCS revaluation learning is developed; this allows
us to identify the conditions determining the ""inextinguishability"" (or
resistant-to-extinction) property of emotional responses and reactions (such as
those observed in evaluative conditioning, in the nonreinforcement presentation
of a conditioned inhibitor, in post-traumatic stress disorders and in panic
attacks). Furthermore, an analysis of the causal relation existing between
classical conditioning and UCS revaluation is provided. Starting from this
result, a theory of implicit emotional learning and a novel interpretation of
classical conditioning are derived. Moreover, we discuss how the proposed
theory can lead to the development of new methodologies for the detection and
the treatment of undesired or pathological emotional responses, and can inspire
animal models for resistant-to-extinction responses and reactions.

that the situation arises from a misuse of the constraint in quantum mechanics.
To use the constraint properly, we convert the vector representation into a
two-component representation in which the wavefunction is not constrained by
any conditions. Upon doing so, we not only separate the spin conceptually from
the orbital angular momentum but also identify the Berry gauge in which the
two-component wavefunction can be canonically quantized. A corollary is that
only in one particular Berry gauge can a radiation field be canonically
quantized in terms of the plane waves. The degree of freedom to fix the Berry

at which they impinge on the electrostatic potentials. For magnetic fields
oriented parallel to the potential boundaries an additional propagating mode
that results from the splitting into Dirac cones enhances the transmission
probability for charge carriers tunneling through the potentials and increases
the corresponding conductance. Our results show that the chiral suppression of
transmission at normal incidence is turned into a chiral enhancement when the
magnetic field increases, thus indicating a transition from a bilayer to a
monolayer-like system at normal incidence. Further, we find that the typical
transmission resonances stemming from confinement in a potential barrier are
shifted to higher energy and are eventually transformed into anti-resonances
with increasing magnetic field. For magnetic fields oriented perpendicular to
the potential boundaries we find a very pronounced transition from a bilayer
system to two separated monolayer-like systems with Klein tunneling emerging at
certain incident angles symmetric around 0, which also leaves a signature in
the conductance. For both orientations of the magnetic field, the transmission
probability is still correctly described by pseudospin conservation. Finally,
to motivate the large in-plane magnetic field, we show that its energy spectrum
can be mimicked by specific lattice deformations such as a relative shift of
one of the layers. With this equivalence we introduce the notion of an in-plane
pseudo-magnetic field.

the latest available results from experiments with atmospheric neutrinos
(Super-Kamiokande and IceCube DeepCore), at accelerators (first T2K anti-nu and
NOvA nu runs in both appearance and disappearance mode), and at short-baseline
reactors (Daya Bay and RENO far/near spectral ratios), as well as a reanalysis
of older KamLAND data in the light of the ""bump"" feature recently observed in
reactor spectra. We discuss improved constraints on the five known oscillation
parameters (delta m^2, |Delta m^2|, sin^2theta_12, sin^2theta_13,
sin^2theta_23), and the status of the three remaining unknown parameters: the
mass hierarchy, the theta_23 octant, and the possible CP-violating phase delta.
With respect to previous global fits, we find that the reanalysis of KamLAND
data induces a slight decrease of both delta m^2 and sin^2theta_12, while the
latest accelerator and atmospheric data induce a slight increase of |Delta
m^2|. Concerning the unknown parameters, we confirm the previous intriguing
preference for negative values of sin(delta) [with best-fit values around
sin(delta) ~ -0.9], but we find no statistically significant indication about
the theta_23 octant or the mass hierarchy (normal or inverted). Assuming an
alternative (so-called LEM) analysis of NOvA data, some delta ranges can be
excluded at >3 sigma, and the normal mass hierarchy appears to be slightly
favored at 90% C.L. We also describe in detail the covariances of selected
pairs of oscillation parameters. Finally, we briefly discuss the implications
of the above results on the three non-oscillation observables sensitive to the
(unknown) absolute nu mass scale: the sum of nu masses, the effective nu_e

the need to explain the observed lack of accreting systems in the ~2-3 h
orbital period range, known as the period gap. The standard model, disrupted
magnetic braking (DMB), reproduces the gap by postulating that CVs transform
into inconspicuous detached white dwarf (WD) plus main sequence (MS) systems,
which no longer resemble CVs. However, observational evidence for this standard
model is currently indirect and thus this scenario has attracted some criticism
throughout the last decades. Here we perform a simple but exceptionally strong
test of the existence of detached CVs (dCVs). If the theory is correct dCVs
should produce a peak in the orbital period distribution of detached close
binaries consisting of a WD and an M4-M6 secondary star. We measured six new
periods which brings the sample of such binaries with known periods below 10 h
to 52 systems. An increase of systems in the ~2-3 h orbital period range is
observed. Comparing this result with binary population models we find that the
observed peak can not be reproduced by PCEBs alone and that the existence of
dCVs is needed to reproduce the observations. Also, the WD mass distribution in
the gap shows evidence of two populations in this period range, i.e. PCEBs and
more massive dCVs, which is not observed at longer periods. We therefore
conclude that CVs are indeed crossing the gap as detached systems, which
provides strong support for the DMB theory.

Repetition of the Prisoner's Dilemma can give rise to cooperation as an

resolve. The numerous behavioral experiments investigating the Prisoner's

predicting behavior at multiple scales in experimental designs not used for

that a two-level system can be left excited after interacting with an
ultrashort pulse whose spectral width is larger than the transition frequency,
and that the excitation probability depends not on the field amplitude but on
the field intensity. The latter makes the excitation profile have the same spot

electrodynamics in the ultrafast light-matter interaction regime since the
usually neglected counterrotating terms describing the interaction with the
free electromagnetic modes are crucial for making the excitation probability
nonzero and depend on the field intensity. These results suggest that a train

  A reachability oracle is a data structure that decides for any two vertices

is measured by the space requirement $S(n)$, the query time $Q(n)$, and the

three data structures whose quality depends on $\Psi$: the first works only for
$\Psi < \sqrt{3}$ and achieves $Q(n) = O(1)$ with $S(n) = O(n)$ and

constitutes a classical problem in theoretical astrophysics. Its application
covers a broad range of objects and scales from planets up to galaxies.
Especially the dynamical friction, caused by the forming wake behind the
object, plays an important role for the dynamics of the system. To calculate
the dynamical friction, standard formulae, based on linear theory are often
used. It is our goal to check the general validity of these formulae and
provide suitable expressions for the dynamical friction acting on the moving
object, based on the basic physical parameters of the problem. We perform
sequences of high resolution numerical studies of rigid bodies moving
supersonically through a homogeneous medium, and calculate the total drag
acting on the object, which is the sum of gravitational and hydro drag. We
study cases without gravity with purely hydrodynamical drag, as well as
gravitating objects. From the final equilibrium state of the simulations, we
compute for gravitating objects the dynamical friction by direct numerical
integration of the gravitational pull acting on the embedded object. The
numerical experiments confirm the known scaling laws for the dependence of the
dynamical friction on the basic physical parameters as derived in earlier
semi-analytical studies. As a new important result we find that the shock's
stand-off distance is revealed as the minimum spatial interaction scale of
dynamical friction. Below this radius, the gas settles into a hydrostatic
state, which causes no net gravitational pull onto the moving body. Finally, we
derive an analytic estimate for the stand-off distance that can be used to
calculate the dynamical friction force.

Compressive Sensing (CS), and it is advantageous in terms of reducing the
amount of storage, easing hardware implementations and preserving
multidimensional structures of signals in comparison to a conventional CS
system. In a TCS system, instead of using a random sensing matrix and a
predefined dictionary, the average-case performance can be further improved by
employing an optimized multidimensional sensing matrix and a learned
multilinear sparsifying dictionary. In this paper, we propose a joint
optimization approach of the sensing matrix and dictionary for a TCS system.
For the sensing matrix design in TCS, an extended separable approach with a
closed form solution and a novel iterative non-separable method are proposed
when the multilinear dictionary is fixed. In addition, a multidimensional
dictionary learning method that takes advantages of the multidimensional
structure is derived, and the influence of sensing matrices is taken into
account in the learning process. A joint optimization is achieved via
alternately iterating the optimization of the sensing matrix and dictionary.
Numerical experiments using both synthetic data and real images demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed approaches.

the Landau quantization associated with an atom with a magnetic quadrupole
moment is introduced, and then, rotating effects on this analogue of the Landau
quantization is investigated. It is shown that rotating effects can modify the
cyclotron frequency and breaks the degeneracy of the analogue of the Landau
levels.

interacts with an external field subject to a harmonic and a linear confining
potentials is investigated. It is shown that the interaction between the
magnetic quadrupole moment and an electric field gives rise to an analogue of
the Coulomb potential and, by confining this atom to a harmonic and a linear
confining potentials, a quantum effect characterized by the dependence of the
angular frequency on the quantum numbers of the system is obtained. In
particular, it is shown that the possible values of the angular frequency
associated with the ground state of the system are determined by a third-degree
algebraic equation.
