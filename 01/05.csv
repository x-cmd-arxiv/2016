fluorescence technique, would be the use of the molecular Bremsstrahlung
radiation emitted by low-energy ionization electrons left after the passage of
the showers in the atmosphere. In this article, a detailed estimate of the
spectral intensity of photons at ground level originating from this radiation
is presented. The spectral intensity expected from the passage of the
high-energy electrons of the cascade is also estimated. The absorption of the
photons in the plasma of electrons/neutral molecules is shown to be negligible.
The obtained spectral intensity is shown to be $2\times10^{-21} $W cm$^{-2}$
GHz$^{-1}$ at 10 km from the shower core for a vertical shower induced by a
proton of $10^{17.5}$ eV. In addition, a recent measurement of Bremsstrahlung
radiation in air at gigahertz frequencies from a beam of electrons produced at
95 keV by an electron gun is also discussed and reasonably reproduced by the

the center of most local galaxies, but they also power active galactic nuclei

constraints on the BH growth and the mass of the first BH seeds. The scenario
of ""direct collapse"" is very appealing as it leads to the formation of large
mass BH seeds in the range 10^4-10^6 Msun, which eases explaining how quasars
at z=6-7 are powered by BHs with masses >10^9 Msun. Direct collapse, however,
appears to be rare, as the conditions required by the scenario are that gas is
metal-free, the presence of a strong photo-dissociating Lyman-Werner flux, and
large inflows of gas at the center of the halo, sustained for 10-100 Myr. We
performed several cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that cover a large
range of box sizes and resolutions, thus allowing us to understand the impact
of several physical processes on the distribution of direct collapse BHs. We
identify halos where direct collapse can happen, and derive the number density
of BHs. We also investigate the discrepancies between hydrodynamical
simulations, direct or post-processed, and semi-analytical studies. We find
that for direct collapse to account for BHs in normal galaxies, the critical
Lyman-Werner flux required for direct collapse must be much less than predicted
by 3D simulations that include detailed chemical models. However, when
supernova feedback is relatively weak, enough direct collapse BHs to explain
z=6-7 quasars can be obtained for more realistic values of the critical Lyman
Werner flux.

producing the symmetry breaking $SU(2,2)\rightarrow SO(1,3)\times SO(1,1)$. The
action for gravity is polynomial in $\{A_{\mu},W\}$ and the field equations are

the recovery of conformalized General Relativity and fourth-order Weyl
conformal gravity as limits of the theory- following imposition of Lagrangian

perturbations identical to that of General Relativity coupled to a massive

In this model, the Standard Model (SM) chiral fermions carry charges under
extra U(1)$^\prime$ gauge symmetry which is spontaneously broken by a
U(1)$^\prime$-charged singlet scalar ($\Phi$). In addition, extra quarks and
leptons are introduced to achieve the anomaly-free conditions, which is a
natural consequence of the assumed $E_6$ GUT. These new fermions are vectorlike
under the SM gauge group but chiral under new U(1)$^\prime$, and their masses
come entirely from the nonzero vacuum expectation value of $\Phi$ through the
Yukawa interactions. Then, the CP-even scalar $h_\Phi$ from $\Phi$ can be
produced at the LHC by the gluon fusion and decay to the diphoton via the
one-loop diagram involving the extra quarks and leptons, and can be identified
as the origin of diphoton excess at 750 GeV. In this model, $h_\Phi$ can decay
into a pair of dark matter particles as well as a pair of scalar bosons,
thereby a few tens of the decay width may be possible.

the Solar System, we obtain that $|\alpha| \leq 1.85 \times 10^{5}\,

stellar masses from DES can be estimated within 25% of CLASH values. We compute
the stellar mass contribution coming from red and blue galaxies, and study the

deviates from the linear behavior. The charge and optical conductivities remain
isotropic despite anisotropic nature of the Fermi contours. An infinitesimally

conductivity shows a single peak at a given photon energy depending on the

packet delay includes the queue waiting time and the service time. In this
work, we study the effect of both the scheduling and the power allocation
algorithms on the delay performance of the SUs.
  To study the delay due to the service time we study a multichannel system
where the channels are sensed sequentially, we study the tradeoff between
throughput and delay. The problem is formulated as an optimal stopping rule
problem where there is a tradeoff between the service time and the throughput.
This tradeoff results from skipping low-quality channels to seek the
possibility of finding high-quality ones in the future at the expense of a
higher probability of being blocked from transmission since these future
channels might be busy.
  On the other hand, the queue waiting time is studied by considering a
multi-user single channel system. Specifically, we study the effect of
scheduling and power allocation on the delay performance of all SUs in the
system. We propose a delay optimal algorithm that protects the PUs from harmful
interference and provides the required delay guarantees to users. Conventional
scheduling algorithms do not provide such guarantees if the interference
channels are heterogeneous. This is because they are developed for conventional
non-CR wireless systems that neglect interference since channels are
orthogonal.
  Finally, we present two potential extensions to these studied problems.

families, generated by a centered random walk by adding to each step a shift

a conserved charge in effective O($n$) scalar field theory (without explicit
symmetry breaking terms) to NNL order for asymmetric volumes in general
$d$--dimensions, using dimensional (DR) and lattice regularizations. This
yields relations between the 4-derivative couplings appearing in the effective
actions for the two regularizations, which in turn allows us to translate
results, e.g. the mass gap in a finite periodic box in $d=3+1$ dimensions, from
one regularization to the other. Consistency is found with a new direct
computation of the mass gap using DR. For the case $n=4, d=4$ the model is the
low-energy effective theory of QCD with $N_{\rm f}=2$ massless quarks. The
results can thus be used to obtain estimates of low energy constants in the
effective chiral Lagrangian from measurements of the low energy observables,
including the low lying spectrum of $N_{\rm f}=2$ QCD in the $\delta$--regime
using lattice simulations, as proposed by Peter Hasenfratz, or from the
susceptibility corresponding to the chemical potential used.

triplet (CaT) index has recently become a popular metal abundance indicator
thanks to its sensitivity to GC metallicity. Here we revisit and assess the
reliability of CaT as a metallicity indicator using our new stellar population
synthesis simulations based on empirical, high-resolution fluxes. The model
shows that the CaT strength of old ($>$ 10 Gyr) GCs is proportional to ${\rm
[Fe/H]}$ below $-0.5$. In the modest metal-rich regime, however, CaT does not
increase anymore with ${\rm [Fe/H]}$ due to the little contribution from
coolest red giant stars to the CaT absorption. The nonlinear nature of the
color--$CaT$ relation is confirmed by the observations of GCs in nearby
early-type galaxies. This indicates that the CaT should be used carefully when
deriving metallicities of metal-rich stellar populations. Our results offer an
explanation for the observed sharp difference between the color and $CaT$
distributions of GCs in the same galaxies. We take this as an analogy to the
view that metallicity--color and metallicity--Lick index nonlinearity of GCs is
primarily responsible for their observed ""bimodal"" distributions of colors and
absorption indices.

The model has only two free parameters, the mass $M_{\phi}$ of the scalar and
the scale $\Lambda$ of new physics. The scalar is dominantly produced through
photon-photon fusion at the LHC and leads to a diphoton final state. It can
also be produced by quark-antiquark fusion in association with a photon or a

interesting search channel with a dilepton-photon resonance. We derive

successfully employed as meso-scale models of heterogeneous solids. As the
application scale generally is much larger than that of the discrete links,
physically relevant simulations are computationally expensive. The
QuasiContinuum (QC) method is a multiscale approach that reduces the
computational cost of direct numerical simulations by fully resolving complex
phenomena only in regions of interest while coarsening elsewhere. In previous
work (Beex et al., J. Mech. Phys. Solids 64, 154-169, 2014), the originally
conservative QC methodology was generalized to a virtual-power-based QC
approach that includes local dissipative mechanisms. In this contribution, the
virtual-power-based QC method is reformulated from a variational point of view,
by employing the energy-based variational framework for rate-independent
processes (Mielke and Roub\'i\v{c}ek, Rate-Independent Systems: Theory and
Application, Springer-Verlag, 2015). By construction it is shown that the QC
method with dissipative interactions can be expressed as a minimization problem
of a properly built energy potential, providing solutions equivalent to those
of the virtual-power-based QC formulation. The theoretical considerations are
demonstrated on three simple examples. For them we verify energy consistency,
quantify relative errors in energies, and discuss errors in internal variables
obtained for different meshes and two summation rules.

have found that the 2-10 keV luminosity per star formation rate (SFR) in these

(12+log[O/H]= 8.3-8.4). Theoretically, the progenitors of XRBs forming in lower
metallicity environments lose less mass from stellar winds over their
lifetimes, producing more massive compact objects (i.e., neutron stars and
black holes), and thus resulting in more numerous and luminous HMXBs per SFR.
We have performed an in-depth study of the only two LBAs that have
spatially-resolved 2-10 keV emission with Chandra to present the bright end of
the X-ray luminosity distribution of HMXBs (L$_X>10^{39}$ erg/s; ultraluminous

shallower bright end slope than the standard XLF. If we conservatively assume
that the brightest X-ray source from each galaxy is powered by an AGN rather
than a HMXB and eliminate these sources from consideration, the luminosity
distribution becomes poorly constrained but does appear to be consistent with a

elliptical galaxies with typical stellar velocity dispersions of 250 km/s and

whether they imply a threshold X-ray luminosity required for masing, or
possibly reflect the difficulty of maintaining a masing disk around much more
massive (>10^8 Msun) black holes at low Eddington ratio. Given the power of
maser disks at probing black hole accretion and demographics, we suggest that
future maser searches should endeavour to remove remaining sample biases, in

to add incoherent laser scattering in such a way that the antiferromagnetic

elucidate the development of the antiferromagnetic order we employ two
complementary techniques: Monte Carlo wave function simulations for small

operating in the thermodynamic limit. The controlled dissipation channels
described in this work are straightforward to add to already existing

of action clustering, which statistically maximizes the information content

determine stream membership for individual stars. Using a mock halo in a toy

of modern astrophysics, including Type Ia supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and the
formation of most observed exotic stellar populations. Typically, the evolution
is assumed to proceed in isolation, even in dense stellar environments such as
star clusters. In this paper, we test the validity of this assumption via the
analysis of a large grid of binary evolution models simulated with the SeBa
code. For every binary, we calculate analytically the mean time until another
single or binary star comes within the mean separation of the mass-transferring
binary, and compare this time-scale to the mean time for stable mass transfer
to occur. We then derive the probability for each respective binary to
experience a direct dynamical interruption. The resulting probability
distribution can be integrated to give an estimate for the fraction of binaries
undergoing mass transfer that are expected to be disrupted as a function of the
host cluster properties. We find that for lower-mass clusters ($\lesssim 10^4$
M$_{\odot}$), on the order of a few to a few tens of percent of binaries
undergoing mass-transfer are expected to be interrupted by an interloping
single, or more often binary, star, over the course of the cluster lifetime,
whereas in more massive globular clusters we expect $\ll$ 1% to be interrupted.
Furthermore, using numerical scattering experiments performed with the FEWBODY

solid-state sources into a regime suitable for scalable implementations.

54 narrow-band filters, J-PAS is particularly suitable for cluster detection in
the range z$<$1. The photometric redshift dispersion is estimated to be only
$\sim 0.003$ with few outliers $\lesssim$ 4\% for galaxies brighter than
$i\sim23$ AB, because of the sensitivity of narrow band imaging to absorption
and emission lines. Here we evaluate the cluster selection function for J-PAS
using N-body+semi-analytical realistic mock catalogues. We optimally detect
clusters from this simulation with the Bayesian Cluster Finder, and we assess
the completeness and purity of cluster detection against the mock data. The
minimum halo mass threshold we find for detections of galaxy clusters and
groups with both $>$80\% completeness and purity is $M_h \sim 5 \times
10^{13}M_{\odot}$ up to $z\sim 0.7$. We also model the optical observable,
$M^*_{\rm CL}$-halo mass relation, finding a non-evolution with redshift and
main scatter of $\sigma_{M^*_{\rm CL} | M_{\rm h}}\sim 0.14 \,dex$ down to a
factor two lower in mass than other planned broad-band stage IV surveys, at
least. For the $M_{\rm h} \sim 1 \times 10^{14}M_{\odot}$ Planck mass limit,
J-PAS will arrive up to $z\sim 0.85$ with a $\sigma_{M^*_{\rm CL} | M_{\rm

are much higher than expected from supernova driving alone, but may arise from
large-scale gravitational instabilities. Using three-dimensional simulations of
local regions of the interstellar medium, we explore the impact of high
velocity dispersions that arise from these disk instabilities. Parametrizing
disks by their surface densities and epicyclic frequencies, we conduct a series
of simulations that probe a broad range of conditions. Turbulence is driven
purely horizontally and on large scales, neglecting any energy input from
supernovae. We find that such motions lead to strong global outflows in the
highly-compact disks that were common at high redshifts, but weak or negligible
mass loss in the more diffuse disks that are prevalent today. Substantial
outflows are generated if the one-dimensional horizontal velocity dispersion
exceeds $\approx 35\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}},$ as occurs in the dense disks that have
star formation rate densities above $\approx 0.1\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm
yr}^{-1}\,{\rm kpc}^{-2}.$ These outflows are triggered by a thermal runaway,
arising from the inefficient cooling of hot material coupled with successive
heating from turbulent driving. Thus, even in the absence of stellar feedback,
a critical value of the star-formation rate density for outflow generation can
arise due to a turbulent heating instability. This suggests that in strongly
self-gravitating disks, outflows may be enhanced by, but need not caused by,
energy input from supernovae.

$N_H = 6.7 (4.0, 9.7) \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ and photon index $\Gamma = 1.8

8 keV is $ 1.7^{+0.4}_{-0.3} \times 10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (90\% confidence
intervals). Both $L_X$ and $\Gamma$ are quite typical of pulsars in PWNe. No
extended emission is seen; we estimate a conservative $3 \sigma$ upper limit to
the surface brightness of any X-ray PWN near the point source to be $3 \times
10^{-17}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ between 0.5 and 8 keV, assuming
the same spectrum as the point source; for a nebula of diameter $13""$, the flux
limit is 6\% of the flux of the point source. The steep radio spectrum of the
PWN ($\alpha \sim -0.7$), if continued to the X-ray without a break, predicts
$L_X\ \rm{(nebula)} \sim 1 \times 10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$, so additional spectral
steepening between radio and X-rays is required, as is true of all known PWNe.
The high Galactic latitude gives a $z$-distance of 350 pc above the Galactic
plane, quite unusual for a Population I object.

little is known about its behavior for gases. This is most likely due to the
difficulties posed to carry out both thermal expansion and specific heat

gas $\Gamma$ depends only on the co-volume $b$ due to interaction effects, it
is smaller than that for the ideal gas ($\Gamma$ = 2/3) and diverges upon
approaching the critical volume; \emph{ii)} for the Bose-Einstein condensation
of an ideal boson gas, assuming the transition as first-order $\Gamma$ diverges
upon approaching a critical volume, similarly to the Van der Waals gas;
\emph{iii)} for $^4$He at the superfluid transition $\Gamma$ shows a singular

any time step each of them picks one of its neighbors with a probability
proportional to their past number of communications; independently, Nature
chooses, with an independent identical distribution in time, which ones are
allowed to communicate. Communications occur when any two neighbors mutually
pick each other and are both allowed by Nature to communicate.
  Our results generalize the ones obtained by Hu, Skyrms and Tarr\`es (2011).
We prove that, up to an error term, the expected rate of communications
increases in average, and thus a.s. converges. If we define the limit graph as
the non-oriented subgraph on which edges are pairs of vertices communicating
with a positive asymptotic rate, then, for stable configurations, within which
every vertex is connected to at least another one, the connected components of
this limit graph are star-shaped and satisfy a certain balance condition.
Conversely, given any stable equilibrium $q$ whose associated graph satisfies
that property, the occupation measure converges with positive probability to a
stable equilibrium in a neighborhood of $q$ with the same limit graph.

approached only at a descriptive level. In previous works we have described
various modules of the cognitive architecture that allows a robot to execute
creative paintings. By means of dual process theories we refine some relevant
mechanisms to obtain artworks, and in particular we explain details about the
resolution level of the CA dealing with different strategies of access to the
Long Term Memory (LTM) and managing the interaction between S1 and S2 processes
of the dual process theory. The creative process involves both divergent and
convergent processes in either implicit or explicit manner. This leads to four
activities (exploratory, reflective, tacit, and analytic) that, triggered by
urges and motivations, generate creative acts. These creative acts exploit both
the LTM and the WM in order to make novel substitutions to a perceived image by
properly mixing parts of pictures coming from different domains. The paper
highlights the role of the interaction between S1 and S2 processes, modulated
by the resolution level, which focuses the attention of the creative agent by
broadening or narrowing the exploration of novel solutions, or even drawing the
solution from a set of already made associations. An example of artificial
painter is described in some experimentations by using a robotic platform.

difficult-to-compute probability densities. This problem is especially
important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown

review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that
approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in
many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov
chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of
densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the
target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the
ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI
applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian
mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to
scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight
important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our
hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of
algorithms.

correlations in the initial state and the Hamiltonian exhibiting delocalizing
transport - we prove that non-Gaussian initial states become locally
indistinguishable from fermionic Gaussian states after a short and well
controlled time. This relaxation dynamics is governed by a power-law
independent of the system size. Our argument is general enough to allow for
pure and mixed initial states, including thermal and ground states of
interacting Hamiltonians on and large classes of lattices as well as certain
spin systems. The argument gives rise to rigorously proven instances of a
convergence to a generalized Gibbs ensemble. Our results allow to develop an
intuition of equilibration that is expected to be more generally valid and
relates to current experiments of cold atoms in optical lattices.

within the framework given by quantum mechanics (QM). In a sense, QM therefore
has the character of a metaphysical theory. Consequently, if it is possible to
derive QM from more basic principles, these principles should be of general,
philosophical nature. Here, we derive the formalism of QM from well-motivated
epistemic principles. A key assumption is that a physical theory that relies on
entities or distinctions that are unknowable in principle gives rise to wrong
predictions. First, an epistemic formalism is developed, using concepts like
knowledge and potential knowledge, identifying a physical state $S$ with the
potential knowledge of the physical world. It is demonstrated that QM emerges
from this formalism. However, Hilbert spaces, wave functions and probabilities
are defined in certain well-defined observational contexts only. This means
that the epistemic formalism is broader than QM. In the fundamental layer of
description, the physical state $S$ is a subset of a state space
$\mathcal{S}=\{Z\}$, such that $S$ always contains many elements $Z$. These
elements correspond to unattainable states of complete knowledge of the world.
The evolution of $S$ cannot be determined in terms of the individual evolution
of the elements $Z$, unlike the evolution of an ensemble in classical phase
space. The evolution of $S$ is described in terms of sequential time $n\in
\mathbf{\mathbb{N}}$, which is updated according to $n\rightarrow n+1$ each
time an event occurs, each time potential knowledge changes. Sequential time
$n$ can be separated from relational time $t$, which describes distances
between events in space-time. There is an entire space-time associated with
each $n$, in which $t$ represents the knowledge at sequential time $n$ about
the temporal relations between present and past events.

modulation. The time-varying spatial distribution of the information molecules
under the reversible adsorption and desorption reaction at the surface of a

derive the net number of newly-adsorbed information molecules expected in any

expected at the steady state to demonstrate the equilibrium concentration.
Given the number of newly-adsorbed information molecules, the bit error
probability of the proposed MC system is analytically approximated.
Importantly, we present a simulation framework for the proposed model that
accounts for the diffusion and reversible reaction. Simulation results show the
accuracy of our derived expressions, and demonstrate the positive effect of the
adsorption rate and the negative effect of the desorption rate on the error
probability of reversible adsorption receiver with last transmit bit-1.
Moreover, our analytical results simplify to the special cases of a full

four of which reside in extended Ly-alpha haloes (often termed Ly-alpha blobs:
LABs). Three of the AGNs are detected by ALMA and have implied SFRs of
~220-410~M_sun/yr; the non detection of the other five AGNs places SFR upper
limits of <210 M_sun/yr. The mean SFR of the protocluster AGNs (~110-210
M_sun/yr) is consistent (within a factor of ~0.7-2.3) with that found for
co-eval AGNs in the field, implying that galaxy growth is not significantly
accelerated in these systems. However, when also considering ALMA data from the
literature, we find evidence for elevated mean SFRs (up-to a factor of ~5.9
over the field) for AGNs at the protocluster core, indicating that galaxy
growth is significantly accelerated in the central regions of the protocluster.
We also show that all of the four protocluster LABs are associated with an ALMA
counterpart within the extent of their Ly-alpha emission. The SFRs of the ALMA
sources within the LABs (~150-410 M_sun/yr) are consistent with those expected
for co-eval massive star-forming galaxies in the field. Furthermore, the two
giant LABs (with physical extents of >100 kpc) do not host more luminous star
formation than the smaller LABs, despite being an order of magnitude brighter
in Ly-alpha emission. We use these results to discuss star formation as the
power source of LABs.

Bragg scattering. The latter condition, on the other hand, relates to free wave

present a study aimed at observing the evolution of these magnetic fields
through this critical time period. We observed stars in open clusters and
stellar associations of known ages, and used Zeeman Doppler Imaging to
characterize their complex magnetic large-scale fields. Presented here are
results for 15 stars, from 5 associations, with ages from 20 to 250 Myr, masses
from 0.7 to 1.2 solar masses, and rotation periods from 0.4 to 6 days. We find
complex large-scale magnetic field geometries, with global average strengths
from 14 to 140 G. There is a clear trend towards decreasing average large-scale
magnetic field strength with age, and a tight correlation between magnetic
field strength and Rossby number. Comparing the magnetic properties of our
zero-age main sequence sample to those of both younger and older stars, it
appears that the magnetic evolution of solar-type stars during the pre-main
sequence is primarily driven by structural changes, while it closely follows
the stars' rotational evolution on the main sequence.

diverse Galactic environments. Of these, 376 have no previously known small
separation companion. The distribution of companion candidates in this catalog
shows evidence for an extremely truncated brown dwarf (BD) desert with a
paucity of BD companions only for systems with $a < 0.1-0.2$ AU, with no
indication of a desert at larger orbital separation. We propose a few potential
explanations of this result, some which invoke this catalog's many small
separation companion candidates found orbiting evolved stars. Furthermore, 16
BD and planet candidates have been identified around metal-poor ([Fe/H] $<

companions $>10 M_{Jup}$. Finally, we find all types of companions are
ubiquitous throughout the Galactic disk with candidate planetary-mass and BD

finite sums of operators. These algorithms are similar to the growing class of
incremental aggregated gradient algorithms, which minimize finite sums of
functions; the difference is that we replace gradients of functions with
black-boxes called operators, which represent subproblems to be solved during
the algorithm. By replacing gradients with operators, we increase our modeling
power, and we simplify the application and analysis of the resulting
algorithms. The operator point of view also makes it easy to extend our
algorithms to allow arbitrary sampling and updating of blocks of coordinates
throughout the algorithm. Implementing and running an algorithm like this on a
computing cluster can be slow if we force all computing nodes to be synched up
at all times. To take better advantage of parallelism, we allow computing nodes
to delay updates and break synchronization.
  This paper has several technical and practical contributions. We prove the
weak, almost sure convergence of a new class of randomized operator-splitting
schemes in separable Hilbert spaces; we prove that this class of algorithms
convergences linearly in expectation when a weak regularity property holds; we
highlight connections to other algorithms; and we introduce a few new

Nonlinear Hebbian Learning is applied to natural images, receptive field shapes

permeability of gas higher than the intrinsic permeability, the surface
diffusion of adsorbed gas in organic pores also can influence the apparent
permeability through its own transport mechanism. In this study, a generalized
lattice Boltzmann model (GLBM) is employed for gas flow through the
reconstructed shale matrix consisting of OM and IOM. The
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to assign the pore size
distribution to each component, and the dusty gas model (DGM) and generalized
Maxwell-Stefan model (GMS) are adopted to calculate the apparent permeability
accounting for multiple transport mechanisms including viscous flow, Knudsen
diffusion and surface diffusion. Effects of pore radius and pressure on
permeability of both IOM and OM as well as effects of Langmuir parameters on OM

It is shown that these non-equilibrium steady states minimize a quadratic form

approximately equal to the rate of change of relative entropy plus a correction

generally fails for non-equilibrium steady states. We use a simple model of
membrane transport to illustrate these concepts.

difficult to fit models to test hypotheses. Methods based on state-space
reconstruction have been proposed to infer causal interactions in noisy,
nonlinear dynamical systems. These ""model-free"" methods are collectively known
as convergent cross-mapping (CCM). Although CCM has theoretical support,
natural systems routinely violate its assumptions. To identify the practical
limits of causal inference under CCM, we simulated the dynamics of two pathogen
strains with varying interaction strengths. The original method of CCM is
extremely sensitive to periodic fluctuations, inferring interactions between
independent strains that oscillate with similar frequencies. This sensitivity
vanishes with alternative criteria for inferring causality. However, CCM
remains sensitive to high levels of process noise and changes to the
deterministic attractor. This sensitivity is problematic because it remains
challenging to gauge noise and dynamical changes in natural systems, including
the quality of reconstructed attractors that underlie cross-mapping. We
illustrate these challenges by analyzing time series of reportable childhood
infections in New York City and Chicago during the pre-vaccine era. We comment
on the statistical and conceptual challenges that currently limit the use of
state-space reconstruction in causal inference.

dendrites in neocortex. Our model is inspired by recent experimental findings
on active dendritic processing and NMDA spikes in pyramidal neurons. These
experimental and modeling studies suggest that the basic unit of pattern memory
in the neocortex is instantiated by small clusters of synapses operated on by
localized non-linear dendritic processes. We derive a number of scaling laws
that characterize the accuracy of such dendrites in detecting activation
patterns in a neuronal population under adverse conditions. We introduce the
union property which shows that synapses for multiple patterns can be randomly
mixed together within a segment and still lead to highly accurate recognition.
We describe simulation results that provide further insight into sparse
representations as well as two primary results. First we show that pattern
recognition by a neuron with active dendrites can be extremely accurate and
robust with high dimensional sparse inputs even when using a tiny number of
synapses to recognize large patterns. Second, equations representing
recognition accuracy of a dendrite predict optimal NMDA spiking thresholds
under a generous set of assumptions. The prediction tightly matches NMDA
spiking thresholds measured in the literature. Our model matches many of the
known properties of pyramidal neurons. As such the theory provides a
mathematical framework for understanding the benefits and limits of sparse
representations in cortical networks.

way to prolong the lifetime of energy-constrained devices, especially in
wireless sensor networks. However, due to huge propagation attenuation, its
energy efficiency is regarded as the biggest bottleneck to widely applications.
It is critical to find appropriate transmission policies to improve the global
energy efficiency in this kind of systems. To this end, this paper focuses on
the sensor networks scenario, where a mobile control center powers the sensors
by RF signal and also collects information from them. Two related schemes,
called as harvest-and-use scheme and harvest-store-use scheme, are
investigated, respectively. In harvest-and-use scheme, as a benchmark, both
constant and adaptive transmission modes from sensors are discussed. To
harvest-store-use scheme, we propose a new concept, the best opportunity for
wireless energy transfer, and use it to derive an explicit closed-form
expression of optimal transmission policy. It is shown by simulation that a
considerable improvement in terms of energy efficiency can be obtained with the
help of the transmission policies developed in this paper. Furthermore, the
transmission policies is also discussed under the constraint of fixed
information rate. The minimal required power, the performance loss from the new
constraint as well as the effect of fading are then presented.

Euclidean space. However the data may actually be functional i.e.\ each data
point is a function of some variable such as time and the function is
discretely sampled. The naive treatment of functional data as traditional
multivariate data can lead to poor performance since the algorithms are
ignoring the correlation in the curvature of each function. In this paper we
propose a method to analyse subspace structure of the functional data by using
the state of the art Low-Rank Representation (LRR). Experimental evaluation on

well established momentum and blade element theories. From a robotics
perspective, the theoretical development of the models for thrust and
horizontal forces and torque (therefore power) are carried out in the body
fixed frame of the quadrotor. Using momentum theory, we propose and model the
existence of a horizontal force along with its associated power. Given the
limitations associated with momentum theory and the inadequacy of the theory to
account for the different powers represented in a proposed bond graph lead to
the use of blade element theory. Using this theory, models are then developed
for the different quadrotor rotor geometries and aerodynamic properties
including the optimum hovering rotor used on the majority of quadrotors. Though
this rotor is proven to be the most optimum rotor, we show that geometric
variations are necessary for manufacturing of the blades. The geometric
variations are also dictated by a desired thrust to horizontal force ratio
which is based on the available motor torque (hence power) and desired flight
envelope of the vehicle. The detailed aerodynamic models obtained using blade
element theory for different geometric configurations and aerodynamic
properties of the aerofoil sections are then converted to lumped parameter
models that can be used for robotic applications. These applications include
but not limited to body fixed frame velocity estimation and individual rotor
thrust regulation [1, 2].

a two-level system (TLS) driven by any periodic driving and coupled to multiple

Floquet theory and Born-Markov master equation. The formalism allows us to
calculate the spectrum when the Floquet states and quasienergies are
analytically or numerically solved for simple or complicated driving fields. We
can systematically explore the spectral features by implementing the present
formalism. To exemplify this theory, we apply the unified formalism to
comprehensively study a generic model that a harmonically driven TLS is
simultaneously coupled to a radiative reservoir and a dephasing reservoir. We
demonstrate that the significant features of the fluorescence spectra, the
driving-induced asymmetry and the dephasing-induced asymmetry, can be
attributed to the violation of detailed balance condition, and explained in
terms of the driving-related transition quantities between Floquet-states and
their steady populations. In addition, we find the distinguished features of
the fluorescence spectra under the biharmonic and multiharmonic driving fields
in contrast with that of the harmonic driving case. In the case of the
biharmonic driving, we find that the spectra is significantly different from
the result of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) under the multiple
resonance conditions. By the three concrete applications, we illustrate that
the present formalism provides a routine tool for comprehensively exploring the
fluorescence spectrum of periodically strongly driven TLSs.

off the surface if the total droplet energy at the instance of maximum

The non-bouncing droplet is characterized by the oscillations on the free

providers because it enables resource sharing at low operating cost.
Multi-tenancy takes several forms depending on whether the back-end file system
is a local file system (LFS) or a parallel file system (PFS), and on whether
tenants are independent or share data across tenants. In this thesis I focus on
and propose solutions to two cases: independent data-local file system, and
shared data-parallel file system.
  In the independent data-local file system case, resource contention occurs
under certain conditions in Cassandra and HBase, two state-of-the-art NoSQL
stores, causing performance degradation for one tenant by another. We
investigate the interference and propose two approaches. The first provides a
scheduling scheme that can approximate resource consumption, adapt to workload
dynamics and work in a distributed fashion. The second introduces a
workload-aware resource reservation approach to prevent interference. The
approach relies on a performance model obtained offline and plans the
reservation according to different workload resource demands. Results show the
approaches together can prevent interference and adapt to dynamic workloads
under multi-tenancy.
  In the shared data-parallel file system case, it has been shown that running
a distributed NoSQL store over PFS for shared data across tenants is not cost
effective. Overheads are introduced due to the unawareness of the NoSQL store
of PFS. This dissertation targets the key-value store (KVS), a specific form of
NoSQL stores, and proposes a lightweight KVS over a parallel file system to
improve efficiency. The solution is built on an embedded KVS for high
performance but uses novel data structures to support concurrent writes.
Results show the proposed system outperforms Cassandra and Voldemort in several
different workloads.

because by the time drivers are alerted, it is already too late. Anticipating
maneuvers beforehand can alert drivers before they perform the maneuver and
also give ADAS more time to avoid or prepare for the danger.

algorithms for maneuver anticipation. For this purpose we equip a car with

driving context from both inside and outside of the car. In order to anticipate
maneuvers, we propose a sensory-fusion deep learning architecture which jointly

the human user does not need to demonstrate optimal trajectories as training

improve over the trajectory currently proposed by the system. We argue that
this coactive preference feedback can be more easily elicited than
demonstrations of optimal trajectories. Nevertheless, theoretical regret bounds
of our algorithm match the asymptotic rates of optimal trajectory algorithms.
  We implement our algorithm on two high degree-of-freedom robots, PR2 and

unique tool to study the extent of thermalization of the bulk medium dominated
by light quarks and gluons. At high $p_T$, D meson azimuthal anisotropy is
sensitive to the path length dependence of charm quark energy loss in the

gluon radiation vs. collisional processes. We present the STAR measurement of
elliptic flow ($v_2$) of $D^0$ and $D^{\pm}$ mesons in Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, for a wide transverse momentum range. These results
are obtained from the data taken in the first year of physics running of the

vertices. The D meson $v_2$ is finite for $p_T > 2 \text{ GeV/c}^2$ and

not easy to verify, but under the additional assumptions that the ensemble

functions such as content filtering, load balancing and optimization of network
traffic. An ordered sequence of middleboxes composing a logical service is
called service chain. Service Function Chaining (SFC) enables us to define
these service chains. Recent optimization models of SFCs assume that the
functionality of a middlebox is provided by a single software appliance,
commonly known as Virtual Network Function (VNF). This assumption limits SFCs
to the throughput of an individual VNF and resources of a physical machine
hosting the VNF instance. Moreover, typical service providers offer VNFs with
heterogeneous throughput and resource configurations. Thus, deploying a service
chain with custom throughput can become a tedious process of stitching
heterogeneous VNF instances. In this paper, we describe how we can overcome
these limitations without worrying about underlying VNF configurations and
resource constraints. This prospect is achieved by distributed deploying
multiple VNF instances providing the functionality of a middlebox and modeling
the optimal deployment of a service chain as a mixed integer programming
problem. The proposed model optimizes host and bandwidth resources allocation,
and determines the optimal placement of VNF instances, while balancing workload
and routing traffic among these VNF instances. We show that this problem is
NP-Hard and propose a heuristic solution called Kariz. Kariz utilizes a tuning
parameter to control the trade-off between speed and accuracy of the solution.
Finally, our solution is evaluated using simulations in data-center networks.

can selectively translate C functions into Prolog predicates. By leveraging two
important features of the Prolog language, i.e., unification and backtracking,
BABEL obfuscates both the data layout and control flow of C programs, making
them much more difficult to reverse engineer. Our experiments show that BABEL
provides effective and stealthy software obfuscation, while the cost is only
modest compared to one of the most popular commercial obfuscators on the

electron/positron number density into the equation of state, the number density
of protons is constrained. We apply this method to four FRII radio galaxies
(Cygnus A, 3C 219, 3C 223 and 3C 284), for which the total cocoon pressures
have been already evaluated. We find that the positron-free plasma comprising
of protons and electrons is ruled out, when we consider plausible particle
distribution functions. In other words, the mixture of positrons is required
for all four FRII radio galaxies; the number density ratio of
electrons/positrons to protons is larger than two. Thus, we find that the
plasma composition is independent of the jet power and the size of cocoons. We
also investigate the additional contribution of thermal electrons/positrons and
protons on the cocoon dynamics. When thermal electrons/positrons are absent,
the cocoon is supported by the electron/ proton plasma pressure, while both
electron/positron pressure supported and electron/proton plasma pressure
supported cocoons are allowed if the number density of thermal
electrons/positrons is about 10 times larger than that of non-thermal ones.

compensate path-loss attenuation and orthogonal frequencies are allocated to
the multiple transmitters to avoid the destructive interference that occurs

manifold, compared to that of Earth-like exoplanets. The presence of tidal
heating, eclipses and planetary illumination in the exomoon energy budget
combine to produce both circumstellar and circumplanetary habitable regions.
Analytical calculations suggest that the circumplanetary habitable region is
defined only by an inner edge (with its outer limits determined by orbital
stability). Subsequent calculations using 1D latitudinal climate models
indicated that the combined effect of eclipses and ice-albedo feedback can
produce an outer edge to the circumplanetary habitable zone. But is this outer
edge real, or an artefact of the climate model's relative simplicity?
  We present an upgraded 1D climate model of Earth-like exomoon climates,
containing the carbonate-silicate cycle and viscoelastic tidal heating. We
conduct parameter surveys of both the circumstellar and circumplanetary
habitable zones, and we find that the outer circumplanetary habitable edge
remains provided the moon's orbit is not inclined relative to that of the
planet. Adding the carbonate-silicate cycle pushes the circumplanetary
habitable zone outward, by allowing increases in atmospheric partial pressure
of carbon dioxide to boost the greenhouse effect. Viscoelastic tidal heating
widens the habitable zone compared to standard, fixed-Q models. Weakening the
tidal heating effect due to melting allows moons to be habitable at higher
eccentricity, and pushes the inner circumstellar and circumplanetary habitable

analysis, the AR contains multiple-flux-tube system, {\it e.g.}, a large flux
tube, both of whose footpoints are anchored to the large bipole field, under
which other tubes exist close to a polarity inversion line (PIL). These various
flux tubes of different sizes and shapes coexist there. In particular, the
later are embedded along the PIL, which produces a favorable shape for the
tether-cutting reconnection and is related to the X-class solar flare. We
further found that most of magnetic twists are not released even after the
flare, which is consistent with the fact that no observational evidence for
major eruptions was found. On the other hand, the upper part of the flux tube
is beyond a critical decay index, essential for the excitation of torus
instability before the flare, even though no coronal mass ejections (CMEs) were
observed. We discuss the stability of the complicated flux tube system and

stationary max-stable processes. Originally, both decompositions were defined
in an abstract way based on the underlying non-singular flow representation. We
provide simple criteria which allow to tell whether a given spectral function
belongs to the conservative/dissipative or positive/null part of the de Haan
spectral representation. Specifically, we prove that a spectral function is
null-recurrent iff it converges to $0$ in the Ces\`{a}ro sense. For processes
with locally bounded sample paths we show that a spectral function is
dissipative iff it converges to $0$. Surprisingly, for such processes a
spectral function is integrable a.s. iff it converges to $0$ a.s. Based on
these results, we provide new criteria for ergodicity, mixing, and existence of
a mixed moving maximum representation of a stationary max-stable process in
terms of its spectral functions. In particular, we study a decomposition of
max-stable processes which characterizes the mixing property.

materials which show low-energy saddle points that are feasible to probe by
gating. We approximate the Fermi surface near saddle point with a hyperbola and
calculate the static Lindhard response function. Employing a theorem of
Lighthill, the induced charge density $\delta n$ due to an impurity is obtained
and the algebraic decay of $\delta n$ is determined by the singularity of the
static response function. Although a hyperbolic Fermi surface is rather
different from a circular one, the static Lindhard response function in the
present case shows a singularity similar with the response function associated
with circular Fermi surface, which leads to the $\delta n\propto R^{-2}$ at
large distance $R$. The dependences of charge density on the Fermi energy are
different. Consequently, it is possible to observe in twisted graphene bilayer
the evolution that $\delta n\propto R^{-3}$ near Dirac point changes to $\delta
n\propto R^{-2}$ above the saddle point. Measurements using scanning tunnelling
microscopy around the impurity sites could verify the prediction.

in pump-probe techniques. Here we investigate the quantum dynamics of effective

attention is paid to the quantum revival time and its relation to the
magnetization tunneling. The quantum revival time has been initially defined as
the recurrence time of a total wave-function. Here we show that the quantum
revivals of wave-functions and expectation values in spin systems may be quite
different which gives rise to a more sophisticated definition of the quantum
revival within the realm of experimental research. Particularly, the revival
times for integer spins coincide which is not the case for half-integer spins.
Furthermore, the quantum revival is found to be shortest for integer ratios
between the on-site anisotropy and an external magnetic field paving the way to
novel methods of anisotropy measurements. We show that the quantum tunneling of
magnetization at avoided level crossing is coherent to the quantum revival time
of expectation values, leading to a connection between these two fundamental
properties of quantum mechanical spins.

orbital depletion situation rather than the orbital filling situation, owing to
the many-body effect. The EHE efficiency is enhanced with increasing
temperature bias, but suppressed as the electron hopping strength reduces. The
fluctuation of QD energy levels at different sites also leads to a reduction of
EHE efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate direction-dependent charge currents
driven by the temperature bias for application as a novel charge diode.

lower bounds: asymptotic Cram\'er-Rao bounds and Le Cam's type of analysis.
Both these approaches allow us to define a class of asymptotically unbiased or
""regular"" estimators for which a lower bound is derived. Consequently, we show
that certain estimators obtained by de-sparsifying (or de-biasing) an
$\ell_1$-penalized M-estimator are asymptotically unbiased and achieve the
lower bound on the variance: thus in this sense they are asymptotically
efficient. The paper discusses in detail the linear regression model and the

polydisperse spheres. The model is developed as a component of a more general
hydromechanical coupling framework based on the discrete element method, which
will be elaborated in future papers. Here the emphasis is on the generation of
a network of pores mapping the void space between spherical grains, and the
definition of local criteria governing the primary drainage process. The pore
space is decomposed by Regular Triangulation, from which a set of pores
connected by throats are identified. A local entry capillary pressure is
evaluated for each throat, based on the balance of capillary pressure and
surface tension at equilibrium. The model reflects the possible entrapment of
disconnected patches of the receding wetting phase. It is validated by a
comparison with drainage experiments. A series of simulations are reported to
illustrate size and boundary effects, key questions when studying small samples
made of spherical particles be it in simulations or experiments. Repeated tests
on samples of different sizes give evolution of water content which are not
only scattered but also strongly biased for small sample sizes. More than
20,000 spheres are needed to reduce the bias on saturation below 0.02.
Additional statistics are generated by subsampling a large sample of 64,000
spheres. They suggest that the minimal sampling volume for evaluating
saturation is one hundred times greater that the sampling volume needed for
measuring porosity with the same accuracy. This requirement in terms of sample
size induces a need for efficient computer codes. The method described herein
has a low algorithmic complexity in order to satisfy this requirement. It will
be well suited to further developments toward coupled flow-deformation problems
in which evolution of the microstructure require frequent updates of the pore

arbitrary wavenumber disturbances is studied. The problem is reduced to
Orr-Sommerfeld equations for the stream function disturbances, defined in each
sublayer and coupled via boundary conditions that account also for possible
interface deformation and capillary forces. Applying the Chebyshev collocation
method, the equations and interface boundary conditions are reduced to the
generalized eigenvalue problems solved by standard means of numerical linear
algebra for the entire spectrum of eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors.
Some additional conclusions concerning the instability nature are derived from
the most unstable perturbation patterns. The results are summarized in the form
of stability maps showing the operational conditions at which a
stratified-smooth flow pattern is stable. It is found that for gas-liquid and
liquid-liquid systems the stratified flow with a smooth interface is stable
only in confined zone of relatively low flow rates, which is in agreement with
experiments, but is not predicted by long-wave analysis. Depending on the flow
conditions, the critical perturbations can originate mainly at the interface
(so-called ""interfacial modes of instability"") or in the bulk of one of the
phases (i.e., ""shear modes""). The present analysis revealed that there is no

burstiness, as well as the memory effect of the editing tasks performed by
different editors in different pages. Our main finding is that, even though the
editing activity is conditioned by the circadian 24 hour cycle, the conditional
probability of an activity of a given duration at a given time of the day is
independent from the latter. This suggests that the human activity seems to be
related to the high ""cost"" of starting an action as opposed to the much lower
""cost"" of continuing that action.

rotation periods (up to several hundred years) has progressively emerged over
the past two decades. However, only lower limits of the periods are known for
most of them because their variations have not yet been observed over a
sufficient timebase.
  Aims. We determine the rotation period of the slowly rotating Ap star HD
18078 and we derive constraints on the geometrical structure of its magnetic
field.
  Methods. We combine measurements of the mean magnetic field modulus obtained
from 1990 to 1997 with determinations of the mean longitudinal magnetic field
spanning the 1999-2007 time interval to derive an unambiguous value of the
rotation period. We show that this value is consistent with photometric
variations recorded in the Stroemgren uvby photometric system between 1995 and
2004. We fit the variations of the two above-mentioned field moments with a
simple model to constrain the magnetic structure.
  Results. The rotation period of HD 18078 is (1358 +/- 12) d. The geometrical
structure of its magnetic field is consistent to first order with a colinear
multipole model whose axis is offset from the centre of the star.
  Conclusions. HD 18078 is only the fifth Ap star with a rotation period longer
than 1000 days for which the exact value of that period (as opposed to a lower
limit) could be determined. The strong anharmonicity of the variations of its
mean longitudinal magnetic field and the shift between their extrema and those
of the mean magnetic field modulus are exceptional and indicative of a very
unusual magnetic structure.

generalizing, in a non-positive definite Krein space, a solvable model

only partial information on the resonance substructure as a result of quantum
interferences. Moreover, we show that the resonance state dominating the GDR in
linear spectroscopy has no adiabatic connection to the resonance state
governing the corresponding cross section when multielectron interactions are
neglected. Going beyond the dipole-allowed correlated electronic structure, we
predict the existence of collective multipole resonances of Xe. Unlike any

Ic and IIb are believed to have shed their outer hydrogen envelopes either by
extremely strong stellar winds, characteristic of classical Wolf-Rayet stars,
or by binary interaction with a close companion star. The exact nature of the
progenitors and the relative importance of these processes are still open
questions. One relatively unexplored method to constrain the progenitors is to
search for high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXB) at SN locations in pre-explosion
X-ray observations. In a HMXB, one star has already exploded as a core-collapse
SN, producing a neutron star or a stellar-mass black hole. It is likely that
the second star in the system will also explode as a supernova, which should
cause a detectable long-term change in the system's X-ray luminosity. In
particular, a pre-explosion detection of a HMXB coincident with a SN could be
informative about the progenitor's nature. In this paper we analyze
pre-explosion ACIS observations of 18 nearby type Ib, Ic and IIb supernovae
from the Chandra X-ray observatory public archive. Two sources that could
potentially be associated with the supernova are identified in the sample.
Additionally we make similar post-explosion measurements for 46 SNe. Although
our modelling indicates that progenitor systems with compact binary companions
are probably quite rare, studies of this type can in the future provide more
stringent constraints as the number of discovered nearby SNe and suitable
pre-explosion X-ray data are both increasing.

multiple access channel (MAC) system, through power control, in a distributed
manner. In contrast with many existing works on energy-efficient power control,
which ignore the possible presence of a queue at the transmitter, we consider a
new generalized cross-layer EE metric. This approach is relevant when the
transmitters have a non-zero energy cost even when the radiated power is zero
and takes into account the presence of a finite packet buffer and packet
arrival at the transmitter. As the Nash equilibrium (NE) is an
energy-inefficient solution, the present work aims at overcoming this deficit
by improving the global energy-efficiency. Indeed, as the considered system has
multiple agencies each with their own interest, the performance metric
reflecting the individual interest of each decision maker is the global
energy-efficiency defined then as the sum over individual energy-efficiencies.
Repeated games (RG) are investigated through the study of two dynamic games
(finite RG and discounted RG), whose equilibrium is defined when introducing a
new operating point (OP), Pareto-dominating the NE and relying only on
individual channel state information (CSI). Accordingly, closed-form
expressions of the minimum number of stages of the game for finite RG (FRG) and
the maximum discount factor of the discounted RG (DRG) were established. The
cross-layer model in the RG formulation leads to achieving a shorter minimum
number of stages in the FRG even for higher number of users. In addition, the
social welfare (sum of utilities) in the DRG decreases slightly with the
cross-layer model when the number of users increases while it is reduced
considerably with the Goodman model. Finally, we show that in real systems with
random packet arrivals, the cross-layer power control algorithm outperforms the
Goodman algorithm.

O(He) star, the only second known RV variable PG 1159 close binary candidate,
as well as the first two naked (i.e., without planetary nebula (PN)) H-rich
post-AGB stars of spectral type O(H) that show significant RV variations. We
present a non-LTE spectral analysis of these stars along with one further
O(H)-type star whose RV variations were found to be not significant. We also
report the discovery of an far-infrared excess in the case of the PG 1159 star.
None of the stars in our sample displays nebular emission lines, which can be
explained well in terms of a very late thermal pulse evolution in the case of
the PG 1159 star. The ""missing"" PNe around the O(H)-type stars seem strange,
since we find that several central stars of PNe have much longer post-AGB
times. Besides the non-ejection of a PN, the occurrence of a late thermal
pulse, or the re-accretion of the PN in the previous post-AGB evolution offer
possible explanations for those stars not harbouring a PN (anymore). In case of
the O(He) star J0757 we speculate that it might have been previously part of a
compact He transferring binary system. In this scenario, the mass transfer must
have stopped after a certain time, leaving behind a low mass close companion
that could be responsible for the extreme RV shift of 107.0 $\pm$ 22.0 km/s

development offers a high-level way for domain users to specify the

models have historically been used for programming complex systems. However
recently they have garnered interest as a separate field of study. Robotic
systems blend hardware and software in a holistic way that intrinsically raises
many crosscutting concerns (concurrency, uncertainty, time constraints, ...),
for which reason, traditional general-purpose languages often lead to a poor
fit between the language features and the implementation requirements. DSLs and
models offer a powerful, systematic way to overcome this problem, enabling the
programmer to quickly and precisely implement novel software solutions to

\bar y)/\sqrt{2}$ bound state $\eta_{zy}(1S)$ to the diphoton measurements
through $\sigma (pp\to \eta_{zy}(1s)\to \gamma \gamma) $ are $
5.6^{+5.6}_{-2.8} {\rm fb}$ at $\sqrt S=13$ TeV. They are constant with the 750
GeV diphoton excess measured by the CMS ant ATLAS collaborations.
