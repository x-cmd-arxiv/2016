be reduced to almost simple groups by a result of Kimmerle and Konovalov. We
prove that the Prime Graph Question has an affirmative answer for all almost
simple groups having a socle isomorphic to $\operatorname{PSL}(2, p^f)$ for $f

automorphic extensions of series of simple groups. Using this, we determine
exactly how far the so-called HeLP-method can take us for (almost simple)
groups having an order divisible by at most $4$ different primes.

studies of Sr$_{1-x}$Na$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ ($0.10 \leq\ x \leq\ 0.60$) to
determine their structural evolution and the extent of the $C_4$ phase.
Spanning $\Delta x\sim 0.14$ in composition, the $C_4$ phase is found to extend
over a larger range of compositions, and to exhibit a significantly higher
transition temperature, $T_r \sim 65$K, than in either of the other systems in
which it has been observed. The onset of this phase is seen near a composition
($x \sim 0.30$) where the bonding angles of the Fe$_2$As$_2$ layers approach
the perfect $109.46^\circ$ tetrahedral angle. We discuss the possible role of
this return to a higher symmetry environment for the magnetic iron site in
triggering the magnetic reorientation and the coupled re-entrance to the

advantages of larger combining ability, variable input channels and less power

ratio in a reasonable range, because large power loss would lead to strict
requirements on the cooling system. A combiner with variable input channels is
convenient for outputting different power levels according to practical
demands. In this paper, a method for designing a variable-channel high-power
cavity combiner is proposed, based on the relation between input and output
coupling coefficients obtained by analyzing the equivalent circuit of the
cavity combiner. This method can put the designed cavity combiner in a matching
state and keep its power loss rate in a reasonable range as the number of input
channels changes. As an example, a cavity combiner with 500 MHz and variable
input channels from 16 to 64 is designed, and the simulation results show that
our proposed method is feasible.

modelled using a deterministic integrodifference equation (IDE) framework, with
distinct dispersal and sedentary stages. Individual based models (IBMs) are the

Galton-Watson branching processes and branching processes in random

yield insight into the factors determining the critical domain size for a given

to $\gamma$ in $\mathcal{C}^0$ as $t\to 0^+ $. Another perspective is that the
level-set flow of $\gamma$ is smooth. This is a generalization of the author's
previous work where the planar case was studied. If a Jordan curve on
$\mathbb{S}^2$ has Lebesgue measure zero then we show that the level-set flow
instantly becomes a smooth closed curve. If the Lebesgue measure is positive
then for small time the level-set flow is an annulus with smooth boundary. This
second case should be interpreted as a failure of uniqueness.
  As in the planar case a key step in the proof is establishing a length
estimate for smooth curves that depends on a geometric quantity called the
$r$-multiplicity. The majority of this paper concerns the extension of this
length estimate to $\mathbb{S}^2$.

years enable non-invasive imaging of vascular structures at the capillary level
by tracking the flow of ultrasound contrast agents (gas microbubbles). However,
these techniques are currently limited by low temporal resolution and long
acquisition times. Super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) is a
fluorescence microscopy technique enabling sub-diffraction limit imaging with
high temporal resolution by calculating high order statistics of the
fluctuating optical signal. The aim of this work is to achieve fast acoustic
imaging with enhanced resolution by applying the tools used in SOFI to
contrast-enhance ultrasound (CEUS) plane-wave scans. The proposed method was
tested using numerical simulations and evaluated using two in-vivo rabbit
models: scans of healthy kidneys and VX-2 tumor xenografts. Improved spatial
resolution was observed with a reduction of up to 50% in the full width half
max of the point spread function. In addition, substantial reduction in the
background level was achieved compared to standard mean amplitude persistence
images, revealing small vascular structures within tumors. The scan duration of
the proposed method is less than a second while current superlocalization
techniques require acquisition duration of several minutes. As a result, the
proposed technique may be used to obtain scans with enhanced spatial resolution
and high temporal resolution, facilitating flow-dynamics monitoring. Our method
can also be applied during a breath-hold, reducing the sensitivity to motion
artifacts.

Based on those results, this paper performs a deep search for other
'Carrington-like' events and analyses interplanetary observations leading to
the ground disturbances which emerged from the systematic analysis. The results
of this study based on two Carrington-like events (1) reinforce the awareness
about the possibility of missing hazardous space weather events as the large
H-spike recorded at Colaba by using global geomagnetic indices, (2) argue
against the role of the ring current as the major current involved in
Carrington-like events, leaving field- aligned currents (FACs) as the main
current involved, and (3) propose abrupt southward reversals of IMF along with
high solar wind pressure as the interplanetary trigger of a Carrington-like

estimated the positioning errors due to uncertainties in the satellite world
lines (U-errors). A distribution of U-errors was obtained, at various times, in
a set of points covering a large region surrounding Earth. Here, the
positioning errors associated to the simplifying assumption that photons move
in Minkowski space-time (S-errors) are estimated and compared with the
U-errors. Both errors have been calculated for the same points and times to
make comparisons possible. For a certain realistic modeling of the world line
uncertainties, the estimated S-errors have proved to be smaller than the
U-errors, which shows that the approach based on the assumption that the
Earth's gravitational field produces negligible effects on photons may be used
in a large region surrounding Earth. The applicability of this approach -which
simplifies numerical calculations- to positioning problems, and the usefulness
of our S-error maps, are pointed out. A better approach, based on the
assumption that photons move in the Schwarzschild space-time governed by an
idealized Earth, is also analyzed. More accurate descriptions of photon
propagation involving non symmetric space-time structures are not necessary for
ordinary positioning and spacecraft navigation around Earth.

sector we use Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) effective models, already tested on
heavy ion collision (HIC). For the quark phase we consider various effective
models, the MIT-Bag static picture, the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) approach with
chiral dynamics and finally the NJL coupled to the Polyakov-loop field (PNJL),
which includes both chiral and (de)confinement dynamics. The idea is to extract
mixed phase properties which appear robust with respect to the model
differences. In particular we focus on the phase transitions of isospin
asymmetric matter, with two main results: i) an earlier transition to a mixed
hadron-quark phase, at lower baryon density/chemical potential with respect to
symmetric matter; ii) an ""Isospin Distillation"" to the quark component of the
mixed phase, with predicted effects on the final hadron production. Possible
observation signals are suggested to probe in heavy-ion collision experiments

derived from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) data
and those derived from other data sets, such as the Planck cosmic microwave
background (CMB) temperature anisotropies. Similarly, a direct
cross-correlation of the CFHTLenS data with Planck CMB lensing data yielded an
anomalously low amplitude compared to expectations based on Planck or
WMAP-derived cosmological parameters (Liu & Hill 2015). One potential
explanation for these results is a multiplicative bias afflicting the CFHTLenS
galaxy shape measurements, from which shears are inferred. Simulations are used
in the CFHTLenS pipeline to calibrate such biases, but no data-driven
constraints have been presented to date. In this paper, we cross-correlate
CFHTLenS galaxy density maps with CFHTLenS shear maps and Planck CMB lensing
maps to calibrate an additional multiplicative shear bias (m) in CFHTLenS
(beyond the multiplicative correction that has already been applied to the
CFHTLenS galaxy shears), following methods suggested by Vallinotto (2012) and
Das et al. (2013). We analyze three magnitude-limited galaxy samples, finding
2-4sigma evidence for m<1 using the deepest sample (i<24), while the others are
consistent with m=1 (no bias). This matches the expectation that the shapes of
faint galaxies are the most prone to measurement biases. Our results for m are
essentially independent of the assumed cosmology, and only weakly sensitive to
assumptions about the galaxy bias. We consider three galaxy bias models,
finding in all cases that the best-fit multiplicative shear bias is less than
unity. A value of m~0.9 would suffice to reconcile the amplitude of density
fluctuations inferred from the CFHTLenS shear two-point statistics with that
inferred from Planck CMB temperature data. This scenario is consistent with our
results.

of hours and shorter. Light curves observed in white light at a time resolution
of a few seconds and with a duration of several hours, obtained in six nights

MU Cen is dominated by ellipsoidal variations of the secondary star. The

in the Solar Nebula. Growing from micrometre-sized dust and ice particles to
km-sized objects is, however, difficult because of growth barriers and time
scale constraints. The gravitational collapse of pebble clouds that formed
through the streaming instability may provide a suitable mechanism for comet
formation.
  We study the collisional compression of cm-sized porous ice/dust-mixed
pebbles in collapsing pebble clouds. For this, we developed a collision model
for pebbles consisting of a mixture of ice and dust, characterised by their
dust-to-ice mass ratio. Using the final compression of the pebbles, we
constrain combinations of initial cloud mass, initial pepple porosity, and
dust-to-ice ratio that lead to cometesimals which are consistent with observed
bulk properties of cometary nuclei.
  We find that observed high porosity and low density of ~0.5 g/cc of comet
nuclei can only be explained if comets formed in clouds with mass approximately
M>1e18 g. Lower mass clouds would only work if the pebbles were initially very
compact. Furthermore, the dust-to-ice ratio must be in the range of between 3
and 9 to match the observed bulk properties of comet nuclei. (abridged version)

irradiated by a circularly polarized laser. It is assumed that the system is
closed, and that the laser has been switched on as a quench. Laser parameters
corresponding to some representative topological phases are studied: one where
the Chern number of the Floquet bands equals the number of chiral edge modes, a
second where anomalous edge states appear in the Floquet Brillouin zone
boundaries, and a third where the Chern number is zero, yet topological edge
states appear at the center and boundaries of the Floquet Brillouin zone.
Qualitative differences are found for the high frequency off-resonant and low
frequency on-resonant laser with edge states arising due to resonant processes
occupied with a high effective temperature on the one hand, while edge states
arising due to off-resonant processes occupied with a low effective temperature
on the other. For an ideal half-filled system where only one of the bands in
the Floquet Brillouin zone is occupied and the other empty, particle-hole and
inversion symmetry of the Floquet Hamiltonian implies zero current density.
However the laser switch-on protocol breaks the inversion symmetry, resulting
in a net cylindrical sheet of current density at steady-state. Due to the
underlying chirality of the system, this current density profile is associated
with a net charge imbalance between the top and bottom of the cylinders.

well-known high-mass star forming regions. Using the JVLA, we have mapped the
hot and dense molecular gas in W51 Main, with about 0.2 arcsec angular
resolution, in five highly-excited metastable inversion transitions of ammonia
(ammonia): (J,K)=(6,6), (7,7), (9,9), (10,10), and (13,13). We have identified
and characterised two main centers of high-mass star formation in W51-Main: the
W51e2 complex and the W51e8 core (6 arcsec southward of W51e2). The former
breaks down into three further sub-cores: W51e2-W, which surrounds the well
known HC HII region, where hot ammonia is observed in absorption, and two
additional dusty cores, W51e2-E (~0.8"" to the East) and W51e2-NW (~1"" to the
North), where hot ammonia is observed in emission. The velocity maps towards
the HC HII region show a clear velocity gradient that may indicate rotation,
though we do not directly observe a Keplerian velocity profile. The absence of
outflow and/or maser activity and the low amount of molecular gas available for
accretion (~5 solar masses) with respect to the mass of the central YSO (>20
solar masses), both indicate that the central YSO has already accreted most of
its final mass. On the other hand, in the nearby W51e2-E object, the relatively
large amount of hot molecular gas available for accretion (~20 solar masses,
within about half an arcsecond or 2500 AU), along with strong outflow and maser
activity, indicates that the main accretion center in the W51e2 complex is
W51e2-E rather than W51e2-W. Finally, W51e2-NW and W51e8, although less dense,
are also hot cores and contain a significant amount of molecular gas (~30 and
70 solar masses, respectively). We speculate that they may host high-mass YSOs
either at a previous evolutionary stage or with lower mass than W51e2-E and
W51e2-W.

synthesis calculations on clean selected features. An intermediate metallicity
of [Fe/H]$=-0.98\pm0.08$ dex and a heliocentric radial velocity of
$v_{hel}=-96.6\pm1.3~km s^{-1}$ were found for NGC 6723. Alpha-element
abundances present enhancements of $[O/Fe]=0.29\pm0.18$ dex,
$[Mg/Fe]=0.23\pm0.10$ dex, $[Si/Fe]=0.36\pm0.05$ dex, and $[Ca/Fe]=0.30\pm0.07$
dex. Similar overabundance is found for the iron-peak Ti with

$[Na/Fe]=0.00\pm0.21$ dex and $[Al/Fe]=0.31\pm0.21$ dex, respectively. Finally,
the s-element Ba is also enhanced by $[Ba/Fe]=0.22\pm0.21$ dex. The enhancement
levels of NGC 6723 are comparable to those of other metal-intermediate bulge
globular clusters. In turn, these enhancement levels are compatible with the
abundance profiles displayed by bulge field stars at that metallicity. This
hints at a possible similar chemical evolution with globular clusters and the
metal-poor of the bulge going through an early prompt chemical enrichment.

from a charge can be derived in a heuristic manner from the kinetic power (rate
of change of the kinetic energy) of its electric inertial mass. The derivation
assumes a non-relativistic but otherwise an arbitrary motion of the charge. We
exploit the fact that as the charge velocity changes because of a constant
acceleration, there are accompanying modifications in its electromagnetic
fields which can remain concurrent with the charge motion because the velocity
as well as acceleration information enters into the field expression. However,
if the acceleration of the charge is varying, information about that being not
present in the field expressions, the electromagnetic fields get `out of step'
with the actual charge motion. Accordingly we arrive at a radiation reaction
formula for an arbitrarily moving charge, obtained hitherto in literature from
the self-force, derived in a rather cumbersome way from the detailed mutual
interaction between various constituents of a small charged sphere. This way we
demonstrate that a power loss from a charge occurs only when there is a change
in its acceleration and the derived instantaneous power loss is directly
proportional to the scalar product of the velocity and the rate of change of
the acceleration of the charge.

produced by coils well separated from the plasma. However the larger the
separation, the more difficult it is to produce a given magnetic field in the
plasma region, so plasma configurations should be chosen that can be supported
as efficiently as possible by distant coils. The efficiency of an
externally-generated magnetic field is a measure of the field's shaping
component magnitude at the plasma compared to the magnitude near the coils; the
efficiency of a plasma equilibrium can be measured using the efficiency of the
required external shaping field. Counterintuitively, plasma shapes with low
curvature and spectral width may have low efficiency, whereas plasma shapes
with sharp edges may have high efficiency. Two precise measures of magnetic
field efficiency, which correctly identify such differences in difficulty, will
be examined. These measures, which can be expressed as matrices, relate the
externally-produced normal magnetic field on the plasma surface to the either
the normal field or current on a distant control surface. A singular value
decomposition (SVD) of either matrix yields an efficiency ordered basis for the
magnetic field distributions. Calculations are carried out for both tokamak and
stellarator cases. For axisymmetric surfaces with circular cross-section, the
SVD is calculated analytically, and the range of poloidal and toroidal mode

quality control. In future applications, they could be efficiently confined,
enhanced and manipulated - well below the classical diffraction limit - through
the excitation of graphene plasmons (GPs). These possibilities emerge from the
strongly reduced GP wavelength, lp, compared to the photon wavelength, l0,
which can be controlled by modulating the carrier density of graphene via
electrical gating. Recently, GPs in a graphene-insulator-metal configuration
have been predicted to exhibit a linear dispersion (thus called acoustic
plasmons) and a further reduced wavelength, implying an improved field
confinement, analogous to plasmons in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs)
near conductive substrates. While infrared GPs have been visualised by
scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM), the real-space
imaging of strongly confined THz plasmons in graphene and 2DEGs has been
elusive so far - only GPs with nearly free-space wavelength have been observed.
Here we demonstrate real-space imaging of acoustic THz plasmons in a graphene
photodetector with split-gate architecture. To that end, we introduce
nanoscale-resolved THz photocurrent near-field microscopy, where near-field
excited GPs are detected thermoelectrically rather than optically. The on-chip
GP detection simplifies GP imaging, as sophisticated s-SNOM detection schemes
can be avoided. The photocurrent images reveal strongly reduced GP wavelengths
(lp = l0/66), a linear dispersion resulting from the coupling of GPs with the
metal gate below the graphene, and that plasmon damping at positive carrier
densities is dominated by Coulomb impurity scattering. Acoustic GPs could thus
strongly benefit the development of deep subwavelength-scale THz devices.

effective monitoring cost. Especially for troubleshooting faults that are
associated with the possibility of remote identification of fiber breaks, which
may exist in the network. Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (OTDR) techniques
are widely used in point-to-point optical network topologies. Nevertheless, it
has major limitations in tree-structured PONs (Passive Optical Networks), where
all different branches backscatter the light in just one conventional OTDR
trace with combined signals arriving on the OLT (Optical Line Terminal) side.
Furthermore, passive power splitters used in FTTH networks input large
attenuation, impoverishing the reflected signal. This makes the identification
of the very branch affected by the problem practically impossible, when
considering conventional analyses. The use of constraint-based techniques have
been applied in a large amount of applications for Engineering Design, where
the duties imposed for graphics and equations constraints result in valued
features to CAD/CAE software capabilities. Currently, it provides a faster

the Fourier transform of $\mu\in M(\mathbb{T}^d)$. We address the
super-resolution problem: For given spectral (Fourier transform) data defined
on a finite set $\Lambda\subset\mathbb{Z}^d$, determine if there is a unique
$\mu\in M(\mathbb{T}^d)$ of minimal norm for which $\hat\mu$ equals this data
on $\Lambda$. Without additional assumptions on $\mu$ and $\Lambda$, our main
theorem shows that the solutions to the super-resolution problem, which we call
minimal extrapolations, depend crucially on the set $\Gamma\subset\Lambda$,
defined in terms of $\mu$ and $\Lambda$. For example, when $\Gamma=0$, the
minimal extrapolations are singular measures supported in the zero set of an
analytic function, and when $\Gamma\geq 2$, the minimal extrapolations are
singular measures supported in the intersection of $\Gamma\choose 2$
hyperplanes. By theory and example, we show that the case $\Gamma=1$ is
different from other cases and is deeply connected with the existence of
positive minimal extrapolations. This theorem has implications to the
possibility and impossibility of uniquely recovering $\mu$ from $\Lambda$. We
illustrate how to apply our theory to both directions, by computing pertinent
analytical examples. These examples are of interest in both super-resolution
and deterministic compressed sensing. Our concept of an admissibility range
fundamentally connects Beurling's theory of minimal extrapolation with Candes
and Fernandez-Granda's work on super-resolution. This connection is exploited
to address situations where current algorithms fail to compute a numerical
solution to the super-resolution problem.

multi-point q-moments of the height function and for the q-correlation
functions. At least in the case of the step initial condition, our formulas
degenerate in appropriate limits to many known formulas of such type for
integrable probabilistic systems in the (1+1)d KPZ universality class,
including the stochastic six vertex model, ASEP, various q-TASEPs, and
associated zero range processes.
  Our arguments are largely based on properties of a family of symmetric
rational functions which can be defined as partition functions of the
inhomogeneous higher spin six vertex model for suitable domains. In the
homogeneous case, such functions were previously studied in
http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0976; they also generalize classical Hall-Littlewood
and Schur polynomials. A key role is played by Cauchy-like summation identities
for these functions, which are obtained as a direct corollary of the
Yang-Baxter equation for the higher spin six vertex model.

Conductance is a popular objective function used in many algorithms for local

We show that continuous optimization of this objective still leads to discrete
communities. We investigate the relation of conductance with weighted kernel
k-means for a single community, which leads to the introduction of a new
objective function, $\sigma$-conductance. Conductance is obtained by setting
$\sigma$ to $0$. Two algorithms, EMc and PGDc, are proposed to locally optimize

based on expectation maximization and projected gradient descent, respectively.
We prove locality and give performance guarantees for EMc and PGDc for a class
of dense and well separated communities centered around the seeds. Experiments
are conducted on networks with ground-truth communities, comparing to
state-of-the-art graph diffusion algorithms for conductance optimization. On
large graphs, results indicate that EMc and PGDc stay localized and produce
communities most similar to the ground, while graph diffusion algorithms
generate large communities of lower quality.

The recent discovery of powerful relativistic jets in radio-loud NLS1s

The observed luminosity of the jet is generally weak, smaller than blazars,
although when rescaled for the mass of the central black hole, it becomes of
the same order of magnitude of the latter. The weak luminosity, and hence
observed flux, resulted in a small number of known RLNLS1. From a recent survey
of RLNLS1s, it was found that only 8 out of 42 sources had radio flux density
at 1.4 GHz greater than 100 mJy, while 21 out of 42 had flux density smaller
than 10 mJy. In addition, given the strong variability at all wavelengths, with
present-day facilities RLNLS1s can often only be detected during high activity
periods. The Square Kilometer Array (SKA), with its superior sensitivity, will
break this limit, allowing us to unveil a relatively unknown population of

theorem which holds for arbitrary initial states, and under the most general
manipulations allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we show
that each of these relations can be seen as the quasi-classical limit of three

star-forming galaxies at z~0 show that their ratios of [CII] to far infrared
(FIR) luminosity are systematically lower than those of more modestly
star-forming galaxies. In this paper, we provide a theory for the origin of
this so called ""[CII] deficit"" in galaxies. Our model treats the interstellar
medium as a collection of clouds with radially-stratified chemical and thermal
properties, which are dictated by the clouds' volume and surface densities, as
well as the interstellar radiation and cosmic ray fields to which they are
exposed. [CII] emission arises from the outer, HI dominated layers of clouds,
and from regions where the hydrogen is H2 but the carbon is predominantly C+.
In contrast, the most shielded regions of clouds are dominated by CO and
produce little [CII] emission. This provides a natural mechanism to explain the
observed [CII]-star formation relation: galaxies' star formation rates are
largely driven by the surface densities of their clouds. As this rises, so does
the fraction of gas in the CO-dominated phase that produces little [CII]
emission. Our model further suggests that the apparent offset in the [CII]-FIR
relation for high-z sources compared to those at present epoch may arise from
systematically larger gas masses at early times: a galaxy with a large gas mass
can sustain a high star formation rate even with relatively modest surface
density, allowing copious [CII] emission to coexist with rapid star formation.

dissipation within the planets, the details of which remain poorly understood.
We demonstrate that resonance locking between moons and internal oscillation
modes of the planet can produce rapid tidal migration. Resonance locking arises
due to the internal structural evolution of the planet and typically produces
an outward migration rate comparable to the age of the solar system. Resonance
locking predicts a similar migration timescale but a different effective tidal
quality factor $Q$ governing the migration of each moon. It also predicts
nearly constant migration timescales a function of semi-major axis, such that
effective $Q$ values were larger in the past. Recent measurements of Jupiter
and Saturn's moon systems find effective $Q$ values that are smaller than
expected (and are different between moons), and which correspond to migration
timescales of $\sim$10 Gyr. If confirmed, the measurements are broadly
consistent with resonance locking as the dominant source of tidal dissipation
in Jupiter and Saturn. Resonance locking also provides solutions to several
problems posed by current measurements: it naturally explains the exceptionally
small $Q$ governing Rhea's migration, it allows the large heating rate of
Enceladus to be achieved in an equilibrium eccentricity configuration, and it
resolves evolutionary problems arising from present-day migration/heating
rates.

process abundances, a galaxy like our own would require to host a few NSBM per

r-process material. Because the ejecta velocities in the tidal tail are
significantly larger than in ordinary supernovae, NSBM deposit a comparable
amount of energy into the interstellar medium (ISM). In contrast to extensive
efforts studying spherical models for supernova remnant evolution, calculations
quantifying the impact of NSBM ejecta in the ISM have been lacking. To better
understand their evolution in a cosmological context, we perform a suite of
three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with optically-thin radiative
cooling of isolated NSBM ejecta expanding in environments with conditions
adopted from Milky Way-like galaxy simulations. Although the remnant morphology
is highly complex at early times, the subsequent radiative evolution that
results from thermal instability in atomic gas is remarkably similar to that of
a standard supernova blast wave. This implies that sub-resolution supernova
feedback models can be used in galaxy-scale simulations that are unable to
resolve the key evolutionary phases of NSBM blast waves. Among other
quantities, we examine the radius, time, mass and kinetic energy content of the

radial motion in Schwarzschild background. It is found that the particle
experiences a spin-induced energy shift, which is proportional to the Hawking

cm, these estimates most probably arise from refractive substructure introduced

estimate an intrinsic brightness temperature of 7*10^12 K, which is consistent
with expected theoretical limits, but which is ~15 times lower than estimates
that neglect substructure. At 6.2 cm, the substructure influences the measured
values appreciably but gives an estimated brightness temperature that is
comparable to models that do not account for the substructure. At 1.35 cm, the
substructure does not affect the extremely high inferred brightness
temperatures, in excess of 10^13 K. We also demonstrate that for a source
having a Gaussian surface brightness profile, a single long-baseline estimate
of refractive substructure determines an absolute minimum brightness
temperature, if the scattering properties along a given line of sight are
known, and that this minimum accurately approximates the apparent brightness
temperature over a wide range of total flux densities.

dissipation, can lead to the formation of hot Jupiters (HJs) or tidal
disruption of planets. Recent population synthesis studies have found that the
fraction of systems resulting in HJs (F_HJ) depends strongly on the planet
mass, host stellar type and tidal dissipation strength, while the total
migration fraction F_mig = F_ HJ + F_dis (including both HJ formation and tidal
disruption) exhibits much weaker dependence. We present an analytical method
for calculating F_HJ and F_mig in the Lidov-Kozai migration scenario. The key
ingredient of our method is to determine the critical initial planet-binary
inclination angle that drives the planet to reach sufficiently large
eccentricity for efficient tidal dissipation or disruption. This calculation
includes the effects of the octupole potential and short-range forces on the
planet. Our analytical method reproduces the resulting planet
migration/disruption fractions from population synthesis, and can be easily
implemented for various planet, stellar/companion types, and for different
distributions of initial planetary semi-major axes, binary separations and
eccentricities. We extend our calculations to planets in the super-Earth mass
range and discuss the conditions for such planets to survive Lidov-Kozai
migration and form close-in rocky planets.

non-relativistic QCD factorization formalism (NRQCD). While this theory
describes much of the world's data on J/\psi and \Upsilon production, there are
still outstanding problems, most notably the polarization of quarkonia at large
p_T in hadron colliders. In this talk we will present new tests of NRQCD
involving the distribution of quarkonia within jets. The distribution of
hadrons within jets is determined by nonperturbative functions called
fragmenting jet functions (FJFs). FJFs are convolutions of fragmentation
functions, evolved to the jet energy scale, with perturbatively calculable
matching coefficients. I show how the FJFs for quarkonia can be calculated in
NRQCD in terms of a few NRQCD long-distance matrix elements (LDME), so the
dependence of the cross section on the energy fraction of the heavy quarkonium,
z, is sensitive to the underlying production mechanism, and therefore provides
a new test of NRQCD. The jet energy and z dependence of the cross section can
be used to perform an independent extraction of NRQCD LDME. Finally, I describe
ongoing work building on this result. This includes comparison of analytic
resummed calculations with Monte Carlo simulations for two-jet events in e^+e^-
collisions with B mesons, and three-jet events with J/\psi, as well as the
definition of boost invariant jet substructure variables and calculation of a
boost invariant soft function that are necessary for analytic calculations of

2D and follow the multidimensional evolution using the FLASH compressible
hydrodynamics code for many convective turnover times until a quasi-steady
state is reached. We characterize the strength and scale of convective motions
via decomposition of the momentum density into vector spherical harmonics. We
find that rotation influences the total power in solenoidal modes, with a
slightly larger impact for carbon and oxygen shell burning than for silicon
shell burning. Including rotation in one-dimensional (1D) stellar evolution
models alters the structure of the star in a manner that has a significant
impact on the character of multidimensional convection. Adding modest amounts
of rotation to a stellar model that ignores rotation during the evolutionary
stage, however, has little impact on the character of resulting convection.
Since the spatial scale and strength of convection present at the point of core
collapse directly influence the supernova mechanism, our results suggest that
rotation could play an important role in setting the stage for massive stellar

with dark matter halos in a $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM)
cosmology. We use mock data from isolated dwarf galaxy simulations to show that
this owes to three main effects. Firstly, stellar feedback heats dark matter,
leading to a 'coreNFW' dark matter density profile with a slowly rising
rotation curve. Secondly, if close to a recent starburst, large HI bubbles push
the rotation curve out of equilibrium, deforming the rotation curve shape.
Thirdly, when galaxies are viewed near face-on, their best fit inclination is
biased high. This can lead to a very shallow rotation curve that falsely
implies a large dark matter core. All three problems can be avoided, however,
by a combination of improved mass models and a careful selection of target
galaxies. Fitting our coreNFW model to mock rotation curve data, we show that
we can recover the rotation curve shape, dark matter halo mass $M_{200}$ and
concentration parameter $c$ within our quoted uncertainties.
  We fit our coreNFW model to real data for four isolated dwarf irregulars,
chosen to span a wide range of rotation curve shapes. We obtain an excellent
fit for NGC 6822 and WLM, with tight constraints on $M_{200}$, and $c$
consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. However, IC 1613 and DDO 101 give a poor fit. For
IC 1613, we show that this owes to disequilibria and its uncertain inclination
$i$; for DDO 101, it owes to its uncertain distance $D$. If we assume $i_{\rm
IC1613} \sim 15^\circ$ and $D_{\rm DDO101} \sim 12$ Mpc, consistent with
current uncertainties, we are able to fit both galaxies very well. We conclude
that $\Lambda$CDM appears to give an excellent match to dwarf galaxy rotation
curves.

multiplexed detection. Multiplexing can be performed with paths in real space,
with paths in time, and in principle with any degree of freedom that has a
sufficient number of eigenstates and that can be coupled to the photon number.
Previous works have addressed the probabilities involved in these measurements
with Monte Carlo simulations, or by restricting the number of detectors to
powers of 2, or without including quantum efficiency or noise. In this work we
find an analytical expression of the detection probabilities for any number of
input photons and any number of on/off photon detectors with a quantum
efficiency $0\%\leq\eta\leq100\%$ and a false count probability
$\varepsilon\geq0$. This allows us to retrodict the number of photons that we
had at the input in the least unbiased way possible. We conclude our work with
some examples.

\emph{social RADAR}, where the stubborn agents excite the system and the latter

  Industrial Case Study",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In order to cope with a complex and changing environment, industries seek to
find new and more efficient ways to conduct their business. According to
previous research, many of these change efforts fail to achieve their intended
aims. Researchers have therefore sought to identify factors that increase the
likelihood of success and found that employees' attitude towards change is one
of the most critical.
  The ability to manage change is especially important in software engineering
organizations, where rapid changes in influential technologies and constantly
evolving methodologies create a turbulent environment. Nevertheless, to the
best of our knowledge, no studies exist that explore attitude towards change in
a software engineering organization.
  In this case study, we have used industry data to examine if the knowledge
about the intended change outcome, the understanding of the need for change,
and the feelings of participation affect software engineers' openness to change
and readiness for change respectively, two commonly used attitude constructs.
The result of two separate multiple regression analysis showed that openness to
change is predicted by all three concepts, while readiness for change is
predicted by need for change and participation. In addition, our research also
provides a hierarchy with respect to the three predictive constructs' degree of
impact.
  Ultimately, our result can help managers in software engineering
organizations to increase the likelihood of successfully implementing change
initiatives that result in a changed organizational behavior. However, the
first-order models we propose are to be recognized as early approximations that
captures the most significant effects and should therefore, in future research,
be extended to include additional software engineering unique factors.

associated with excitons in TMDs result in very fast energy transfer rates. The
energy transfer times depend on the exciton momentum, exciton linewidth, and
the interlayer separation and can range from values less than 100 femtoseconds
to more than tens of picoseconds. Whereas inside the light cone the energy
transfer rates of longitudinal and transverse excitons are comparable, outside
the light cone the energy transfer rates of longitudinal excitons far exceed
those of transverse excitons. Average energy transfer times for a thermal
ensemble of longitudinal and transverse excitons is temperature dependent and
can be smaller than a picosecond at room temperature for interlayer separations

its ferromagnetic (FM) layer being wedged-deposited and discover an extra

magneto-optical Kerr (MOKE) microscopy. These results indicate the possibility
of engineering deterministic spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching by controlling

self-consistency checks and comparisons to existing radio data. The combined
three epoch image has arcminute resolution and a 1-sigma thermal noise level of
375 micro-Jy per beam, although the effective noise is a factor 3 higher due to
residual sidelobe confusion. From this we derive a catalogue of 3,722 discrete

not statistically preferred to the double-peaked narrow emitters, and more
efforts should be necessary to carefully find candidates for dual supermassive

heterostructures opens up a wealth of possibilities for novel electronic and
optical functionalities. Exploiting them hinges on accurate measurements of the
band parameters and orbital hybridization in separate and stacked monolayers,
many of which are only available as small samples. The recently introduced
technique of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with submicron spatial
resolution ({\mu}-ARPES) offers the capability to measure small samples, but
the energy resolution obtained for such exfoliated samples to date (~0.5 eV)
has been inadequate. Here, we show that by suitable heterostructure sample
design the full potential of {\mu}-ARPES can be realized. We focus on
MoSe2/WSe2 van der Waals heterostructures, which are 2D analogs of 3D
semiconductor heterostructures. We find that in a MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayer the
bands in the K valleys are weakly hybridized, with the conduction and valence
band edges originating in the MoSe2 and WSe2 respectively. There is stronger
hybridization at the {\Gamma} point, but the valence band edge remains at the K
points. This is consistent with the recent observation of interlayer excitons
where the electron and hole are valley polarized but in opposite layers. We
determine the valence band offset to be 300 meV, which combined with
photoluminescence measurements implies that the binding energy of interlayer
excitons is at least 200 meV, comparable with that of intralayer excitons.

double-component structures with a mean projected separation of 0.""63 (~ 4.0

evaluate their morphological properties, that is, size and ellipticity. While
some of them are compact and indistinguishable from the PSF half-light radius

spatially extended up to 0.""3 (~ 1.9 kpc). We find that the ACS sources show a
positive correlation between ellipticity and size and that the ACS sources with
large size and round shape are absent. Our Monte Carlo simulation suggests that
the correlation can be explained by (1) the deformation effects via PSF
broadening and shot noise or (2) the source blending in which two or more
sources with small separation are blended in our ACS image and detected as a
single elongated source. Therefore, the 46 single-component LAEs could contain
the sources which consist of double (or multiple) components with small spatial
separation (i.e., < 0.""3 or 1.9 kpc). Further observation with high angular
resolution at longer wavelengths (e.g., rest-frame wavelengths of > 4000 A) is

systems, it is advantageous to recycle preconditioners, that is, update a
previous preconditioner and reuse the updated version. In this paper, we
introduce a simple and effective method for doing this. Although our approach
can be used for matrices changing slowly in any way, we focus on the important
case of sequences of the type $(s_k\textbf{E}(\textbf{p}) +
\textbf{A}(\textbf{p}))\textbf{x}_k = \textbf{b}_k$, where the right hand side
may or may not change. More general changes in matrices will be discussed in a
future paper. We update preconditioners by defining a map from a new matrix to
a previous matrix, for example the first matrix in the sequence, and combine
the preconditioner for this previous matrix with the map to define the new
preconditioner. This approach has several advantages. The update is entirely
independent from the original preconditioner, so it can be applied to any
preconditioner. The possibly high cost of an initial preconditioner can be
amortized over many linear solves. The cost of updating the preconditioner is
more or less constant and independent of the original preconditioner. There is
flexibility in balancing the quality of the map with the computational cost. In
the numerical experiments section we demonstrate good results for several
applications, in particular when using an algebraic multigrid preconditioner.

matrix elements and cluster-shell competition using antisymmetrized quasi
cluster model (AQCM), where the dissolution of $alpha$ clusters into quasi
clusters due to the effect of the spin-orbit force is introduced. We focus on
the structure change when the strength of the spin-orbit force is varied. The
ground state dominantly has a compact four $alpha$ structure (doubly magic
structure of the $p$ shell), which is rather independent of the strength.
However the first excited state ($0_2^+$) has $^{12}$C$+alpha$ cluster
structure and this state is largely affected by the increase of the strength;
the subclosure configuration of the $p_{3/2}$ shell for the $^{12}$C cluster
part becomes more important than three $alpha$ configuration. The $E0$
transition from the ground state with compact four $alpha$ configuration to the
$0^+_2$ state with $^{12}$C$+alpha$ cluster configuration is suppressed when
increasing the spin-orbit strength. Although the $E0$ operator itself does not
have the spin dependence, the matrix element is sensitive to the difference of
intrinsic spin structures of the two states. The $E0$ transition characterizes
the persistence of four $alpha$ structure in the $0^+_2$ state.

previous work in natural language processing by using a state-of-the-art
part-of-speech tagger and named entity recognizer to find blocks of text which
may refer to locations. A knowledge base (OpenStreatMap) is then used to find a
list of possible locations for each block. Finally, one location is chosen for
each block by assigning distance-based scores to each location and repeatedly
selecting the location and block with the best score. We tested our geolocation
algorithm with Wikipedia articles about topics with a well-defined geographical
location that are geotagged by the articles' authors, where classification
approaches have achieved median errors as low as 11 km, with attainable
accuracy limited by the class size. Our approach achieved a 10th percentile
error of 490 metres and median error of 54 kilometres on the Wikipedia dataset
we used. When considering the five location tags with the greatest scores, 50%
of articles were assigned at least one tag within 8.5 kilometres of the
article's author-assigned true location. We also tested our approach on Twitter
messages that are tagged with the location from which the message was sent.
Twitter texts are challenging because they are short and unstructured and often
do not contain words referring to the location they were sent from, but we
obtain potentially useful results. We explain how we use the Spark framework

classification-based approaches for location tagging may be reaching their
upper accuracy limit, but our precision-focused approach has high accuracy for

study thermodynamical properties of pure and doped graphene sheet and the
results have been compared with available theoretical and experimental data.
The concentration of B and N has been varied upto 50% of the carbon atoms in
graphene. Phonon frequencies are essential ingredients entering into such a
calculation, which have been computed by using the dynamical matrix provided by
VASP software in combination with phonopy code in the harmonic approximation.
This easily provides us the Helmholtz free energy and leads us to numerical
estimates of various thermodynamical properties. The results for specific heat
are in good agreement with various theoretical and experimental studies
obtained earlier for pure graphene. Interesting new results have been reported
for B and N substituted structure. It has been observed that specific heat
decreases with the increase in concentration of doping while the entropy
increases. Further, large doping concentrations result in unstable sheets
resulting in imaginary frequencies in the transverse directions. The
instability needs to be compensated by external strains and that has been
assumed while carrying out Brilluoin summations. These results will be useful
for calculation of thermal conductivity of doped graphene and thus feasibility
of using these for device applications. Our preliminary results for thermal
expansion have indicated negative thermal expansion behavior of pure graphene
at low temperatures which needs investigation on doped graphene as well.

limited by statistical uncertainty in our measurement. Dipole and quadrupole
leakage at this level lead to systematic error on r<0.01 before any mitigation
due to scan cross-linking or boresight rotation. The measured scalar leakage
and the theoretical level of dipole and quadrupole leakage produce systematic
error of r<0.001 for the ABS survey and focal-plane layout before any data

significant beam systematic error mitigation from its HWP and shows the promise
of continuously-rotating HWPs for future experiments.

to find several nearest neighboring data points for each interpolated point to
adaptively determine the power parameter; and then the desired prediction value
of the interpolated point is obtained by weighted interpolating using the power
parameter. In this work, we develop a fast kNN search approach based on the
space-partitioning data structure, even grid, to improve the previous
GPU-accelerated AIDW algorithm. The improved algorithm is composed of the
stages of kNN search and weighted interpolating. To evaluate the performance of
the improved algorithm, we perform five groups of experimental tests.
Experimental results show that: (1) the improved algorithm can achieve a
speedup of up to 1017 over the corresponding serial algorithm; (2) the improved
algorithm is at least two times faster than our previous GPU-accelerated AIDW
algorithm; and (3) the utilization of fast kNN search can significantly improve

systems. The results of the simulation experiments show that the proposed CCA
outperforms the compared CCAs in terms of average throughput, loss ratio and
fairness, especially when a small buffer is applied. Moreover, Agile-SD shows
lower sensitivity to the buffer size change and packet error rate variation

enhancements can be obtained with mode-separable states and local measurements.
The crucial resource for quantum enhancement is shown to be a large number
variance in the probe state, which can be obtained without any entanglement
between the modes. This has important practical implications because local
strategies using separable states have many advantages over global schemes
using multi-mode-entangled states. Such advantages include a robustness to
local estimation failure, more flexibility in the distribution of resources,
and comparatively easier state preparation. We obtain our results by analyzing

measuring a number of phases relative to a reference, which is concerned

CI perturbatively selected iteratively (CIPSI) calculation. In the CIPSI
algorithm, the CI expansion is iteratively enlarged by selecting the best
determinants using perturbation theory, which provides an optimal and automatic
way of constructing truncated CI expansions approaching the full CI limit. We
perform a systematic study of variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and fixed-node
diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) total energies of first-row atoms from B to Ne with
different levels of optimization of the parameters (Jastrow parameters,
coefficients of the determinants, and orbital parameters) in these trial wave
functions. The results show that the reoptimization of the coefficients of the
determinants in VMC (together with the Jastrow factor) leads to an important
lowering of both VMC and DMC total energies, and to their monotonic convergence
with the number of determinants. In addition, we show that the reoptimization
of the orbitals is also important in both VMC and DMC for the Be atom when
using a large basis set. These reoptimized Jastrow-CIPSI wave functions appear
as promising, systematically improvable trial wave functions for QMC
calculations.

deal with large clusters in the framework of a cluster extension of the DMFT.
In the rr-DMFT, large clusters are decomposed into multiple smaller clusters
through a real-space renormalization. In this work, the renormalization effect
is taken into account only at the lowest order with respect to the intercluster
coupling, which nonetheless reproduces exactly both the noninteracting and
atomic limits. Our method allows us large cluster-size calculations which are
intractable with the conventional cluster extensions of the DMFT with impurity
solvers, such as the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo and exact
diagonalization methods. We benchmark the rr-DMFT for the two-dimensional
Hubbard model on a square lattice at and away from half filling, where the
spatial correlations play important roles. Our results on the spin structure
factor indicate that the growth of the antiferromagnetic spin correlation is
taken into account beyond the decomposed cluster size. We also show that the
self-energy obtained from the large-cluster solver is reproduced by our method
better than the solution obtained directly for the smaller cluster. When
applied to the Mott metal-insulator transition, the rr-DMFT is able to
reproduce the reduced critical value for the Coulomb interaction comparable to
the large cluster result.

receivers know a priori the private messages intended for each other. This
channel generalizes BCSI with common message and Gelfand-Pinsker problem and
has applications in cellular communication systems. We establish an achievable
rate region for BCSI with noncausal state and show that it is strictly larger
than the straightforward extension of the Gelfand-Pinsker result. To achieve
the established rate region with polar coding, we present polar codes for the
general Gelfand-Pinsker problem, which adopts chaining construction and
utilizes causal information to pre-transmit the frozen bits. It is also shown
that causal information is necessary to pre-transmit the frozen bits. Based on
the result of Gelfand-Pinsker problem, we use the chaining construction method
to design polar codes for BCSI with noncausal state. The difficulty is that
there are multiple chains sharing common information bit indices. To avoid
value assignment conflicts, a nontrivial polarization alignment scheme is
presented. It is shown that the proposed rate region is tight for degraded BCSI

to exactly matching partial orders, while a low similarity is associated to a
pair of independent partial orders. The time complexity of the computation of
this similarity measure is $\mathcal{O}(\left|{\mathcal C}\right|^3)$ in the

field. In this work, we aim at introducing a novel technique of reconstructing
the magnetic field inclination on the basis of the dominating wave periods in

observed an isolated, circular sunspot (NOAA11823) for 58 min in a purely

zenith inclinations in the chromosphere and upper photosphere. The results are
in good agreement with the lower photospheric HMI magnetograms. The sunspot's
magnetic field in the chromosphere inclines from almost vertical (0$^{\circ}$)
in the umbra to around 60$^{\circ}$ in the outer penumbra. With increasing
altitude in the sunspot atmosphere, the magnetic field of the penumbra becomes
less inclined. We conclude that the reconstruction of the magnetic field

results. The technique opens up a new possibility to infer the magnetic field

symmetry: One can construct three operators that commute with the evolution
kernel and form an $SL(2)$ algebra, i.e. they satisfy (exactly) the $SL(2)$
commutation relations. In this paper we find explicit expressions for these
operators to two-loop accuracy going over to QCD in non-integer $d=4-2\epsilon$
space-time dimensions at the intermediate stage. In this way conformal symmetry
of QCD is restored on quantum level at the specially chosen (critical) value of
the coupling, and at the same time the theory is regularized allowing one to
use the standard renormalization procedure for the relevant Feynman diagrams.
Quantum corrections to conformal generators in $d=4-2\epsilon$ effectively
correspond to the conformal symmetry breaking in the physical theory in four
dimensions and the $SL(2)$ commutation relations lead to nontrivial constraints
on the renormalization group equations for composite operators. This approach
is valid to all orders in perturbation theory and the result includes
automatically all terms that can be identified as due to a nonvanishing QCD
$\beta$-function (in the physical theory in four dimensions). Our result can be
used to derive three-loop evolution equations for flavor-nonsinglet
quark-antiquark operators including mixing with the operators containing total
derivatives. These equations govern, e.g., the scale dependence of generalized
hadron parton distributions and light-cone meson distribution amplitudes.

interest of late, involves comparing theory-generated probability distributions
over observables with their experimentally measured values. It is likely that
such distributions, were we indeed able to calculate them unambiguously, will
assign low probabilities to any such experimental measurements. An alternative
to thereby rejecting these theories, is to conditionalize the distributions
involved by restricting attention to domains of the multiverse in which we
might arise. In order to elicit a crisp prediction, however, one needs to make
a further assumption about how typical we are of the chosen domains. In this
paper, we investigate interactions between the spectra of available assumptions
regarding both conditionalization and typicality, and draw out the effects of
these interactions in a concrete setting; namely, on predictions of the total
number of species that contribute significantly to dark matter. In particular,
for each conditionalization scheme studied, we analyze how correlations between
densities of different dark matter species affect the prediction, and explicate
the effects of assumptions regarding typicality. We find that the effects of
correlations can depend on the conditionalization scheme, and that in each case
atypicality can significantly change the prediction. In doing so, we
demonstrate the existence of overlaps in the predictions of different
""frameworks"" consisting of conjunctions of theory, conditionalization scheme
and typicality assumption. This conclusion highlights the acute challenges
involved in using such tests to identify a preferred framework that aims to
describe our observational situation in a multiverse.

2048x4096 grid points. This allows to study the dust evolution well beyond
vortex dissipation. We vary a wide range of parameters, most notably the
dust-to-gas ratio in the initial setup varies in the range $10^{-3}$ to $0.1$.
Irrespective of the initial dust-to-gas ratio we find rapid concentration of
the dust inside vortices, reaching dust-to-gas ratios of order unity inside the
vortex. We present an analytical model that describes very well the dust
capture process inside vortices, finding consistent results for all dust-to-gas
ratios. A vortex streaming instability develops which causes invariably vortex
destruction. After vortex dissipation large-scale dust-rings encompassing a
disk annulus form in most cases, which sustain very high dust concentration,
approaching ratios of order unity. The rings are long lived lasting as long as
the duration of the simulations. They also develop a streaming instability,
which manifests itself in eddies at various scales within which the dust forms
compact high density clumps. Such clumps would be unstable to gravitational
collapse in absence of strong dissipation by viscous forces. When vortices are
particularly long lived, rings do not form but dust clumps inside vortices
become then long lived features and would likely undergo collapse by
gravitational instability. Rings encompass almost an Earth mass of solid
material, while even larger masses of dust do accumulate inside vortices in the
earlier stage. We argue that rapid planetesimal formation would occur in the
dust clumps inside the vortices as well as in the post-vortex ring.

measured value of the Higgs mass we find that $M_{SS}$ can take any value up to
the GUT scale. Furthermore, the choice of universal soft terms favors
SUSY-breaking scales close to the GUT scale.

published late-time spectral sequence of a SN Iax. At late times, SNe Iax have
generally similar spectra, all with a similar continuum shape and strong
forbidden-line emission. However, there is also significant diversity where
some late-time SN Iax spectra display narrow P-Cygni features and a continuum
indicative of a photosphere in addition to strong narrow forbidden lines, while
others have no obvious P-Cygni features, strong broad forbidden lines, and weak
narrow forbidden lines. Finally, some SNe Iax have spectra intermediate to
these two varieties with weak P-Cygni features and broad/narrow forbidden lines
of similar strength. We find that SNe Iax with strong broad forbidden lines
also tend to be more luminous and have higher-velocity ejecta at peak
brightness. We estimate blackbody and kinematic radii of the late-time
photosphere, finding the latter an order of magnitude larger than the former.
We propose a two-component model that solves this discrepancy and explains the
diversity of the late-time spectra of SNe Iax. In this model, the broad
forbidden lines originate from the SN ejecta, while the photosphere, P-Cygni
lines, and narrow forbidden lines originate from a wind launched from the
remnant of the progenitor white dwarf and is driven by the radioactive decay of
newly synthesized material left in the remnant. The relative strength of the
two components accounts for the diversity of late-time SN Iax spectra. This

decline of SNe Iax. (Abridged)

with the 13 C carbon isotope (nuclear spin I = 1/2) in diamond possess uniquely
long spin lattice relaxation times (Reynhardt, E.C. and G.L. High, Prog. in

especially when strongly polarised, they form a promising contrast agent for

cryogenic temperatures. Here we demonstrate an efficient scheme that realises
optically induced 13 C nuclear spin hyperpolarisation in diamond at room
temperature and low ambient magnetic field. Optical pumping of a
Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centre creates a continuously renewable electron spin
polarisation which can be transferred to surrounding 13 C nuclear spins.

considered to model the tip_sample interaction, in which the coefficients are
directly dependent on the tip_substrate capacitance. This method avoids any

considerably reduces amount of experimental data needed for the calculation
compared with other techniques. The work presented here also corroborates that
for tip_sample separation lower than 200 nm, the parallel plate_capacitor
approximation is not very appropriate to describe the tip_substrate capacitive
interaction, but an intermediate approximation between a sphere_plane and a

Finite Element (FE) method, they are based on fixed-point solutions of the
Lippmann-Schwinger type integral equation. Their computational efficiency
results from handling the kernel of this equation by the Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT). However, the kernel is derived from an auxiliary homogeneous linear
problem, which renders the extension of FFT-based schemes to non-linear
problems conceptually difficult. This paper aims to establish a link between
FE- and FFT-based methods, in order to develop a solver applicable to general
history- and time-dependent material models. For this purpose, we follow the
standard steps of the FE method, starting from the weak form, proceeding to the
Galerkin discretization and the numerical quadrature, up to the solution of
non-linear equilibrium equations by an iterative Newton-Krylov solver. No
auxiliary linear problem is thus needed. By analyzing a two-phase laminate with
non-linear elastic, elasto-plastic, and visco-plastic phases, and by
elasto-plastic simulations of a dual-phase steel microstructure, we demonstrate
that the solver exhibits robust convergence. These results are achieved by
re-using the non-linear FE technology, with the potential of further extensions
beyond small-strain inelasticity considered in this paper.

logic Bell state, resorting to the photon-atom interaction in low-quality (Q)
cavity and atomic state measurement. Different from existing EPPs, this
protocol can also purify the logic phase-flip error, and the bit-flip error and
the phase-flip error in physic qubit. During the protocol, we only require to
measure the atom states, and it is useful for improving the entanglement of
photon systems in future large-scale quantum networks.

three application examples for laboratory phonology: compositional phonological
speech modelling, a comparison of phonological systems and an experimental
phonological parametric text-to-speech (TTS) system. The featural
representations of the following three phonological systems are considered in
this work: (i) Government Phonology (GP), (ii) the Sound Pattern of English

speech, we conclude that the latter achieves slightly better results than the
former. However, GP - the most compact phonological speech representation -
performs comparably to the systems with a higher number of phonological
features. The parametric TTS based on phonological speech representation, and
trained from an unlabelled audiobook in an unsupervised manner, achieves
intelligibility of 85% of the state-of-the-art parametric speech synthesis. We
envision that the presented approach paves the way for researchers in both

phonologists might test the applied concepts of their theoretical models, and
on the other hand, the speech processing community may utilize the concepts

ferromagnetic (F) to nonferromagnetic, with unusually low thermal hysteresis
and a large change in magnetization. The low temperature magnetic structures in
the martensitic phase of such alloys, which are distinctly inhomogeneous, are
of great interest but are not well understood. Our present use of spin echo
NMR, in the large hyperfine fields at $^{55}Mn$ sites, provides compelling
evidence that nanoscale magnetic phase separation into F and antiferromagnetic
(AF) regions occurs below $T_{M}$ in alloys with x in the range 0 to 7. At
finite Co substitution the F regions are found to be of two distinct types,
corresponding to high and low local concentrations of Co on Ni sites. Estimates
of the size distributions of both the F and AF nanoregions have been made. At x
= 7 the AF component is not long-range ordered, even below 4 K, and is quite
different to the AF component found at x = 0; by x = 14 the F phase is
completely dominant. Of particular interest, we find, for x = 7, that field
cooling leads to dramatic changes in the AF regions. These findings provide
insight into the origins of magnetic phase separation and superparamagnetism in

high dimensional heterogeneous data. This model has several appealing features:
(1) By considering different conditional quantiles, we may obtain a more
complete picture of the conditional distribution of a response variable given
high dimensional covariates. (2) The sparsity level is allowed to be different
at different quantile levels. (3) The partially linear additive structure
accommodates nonlinearity and circumvents the curse of dimensionality. (4) It
is naturally robust to heavy-tailed distributions. In this paper, we
approximate the nonlinear components using B-spline basis functions. We first
study estimation under this model when the nonzero components are known in
advance and the number of covariates in the linear part diverges. We then
investigate a nonconvex penalized estimator for simultaneous variable selection
and estimation. We derive its oracle property for a general class of nonconvex
penalty functions in the presence of ultra-high dimensional covariates under
relaxed conditions. To tackle the challenges of nonsmooth loss function,
nonconvex penalty function and the presence of nonlinear components, we combine
a recently developed convex-differencing method with modern empirical process
techniques. Monte Carlo simulations and an application to a microarray study
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We also discuss how the
method for a single quantile of interest can be extended to simultaneous
variable selection and estimation at multiple quantiles.

accreting supermassive black holes and is essential for the study of the
properties of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) population, black hole
evolution, and galaxy-black hole coevolution. Up to now, the AGN luminosity
function has been estimated several times in soft (0.5-2 keV) and hard X-rays
(2-10 keV). AGN selection in these energy ranges often suffers from
identification and redshift incompleteness and, at the same time, photoelectric
absorption can obscure a significant amount of the X-ray radiation. We estimate
the evolution of the luminosity function in the 5-10 keV band, where we
effectively avoid the absorbed part of the spectrum, rendering absorption
corrections unnecessary up to NH=10^23 cm^-2. Our dataset is a compilation of
six wide, and deep fields: MAXI, HBSS, XMM-COSMOS, Lockman Hole, XMM-CDFS,
AEGIS-XD, Chandra-COSMOS, and Chandra-CDFS. This extensive sample of ~1110 AGN
(0.01<z<4.0, 41<log L_x<46) is 98% redshift complete with 68% spectroscopic
redshifts. We use Bayesian analysis to select the best parametric model from
simple pure luminosity and pure density evolution to more complicated
luminosity and density evolution and luminosity-dependent density evolution. We
estimate the model parameters that describe best our dataset separately for
each survey and for the combined sample. We show that, according to Bayesian
model selection, the preferred model for our dataset is the
luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE). Our estimation of the AGN
luminosity function does not require any assumption on the AGN absorption and
is in good agreement with previous works in the 2-10 keV energy band based on
X-ray hardness ratios to model the absorption in AGN up to redshift three. Our
sample does not show evidence of a rapid decline of the AGN luminosity function
up to redshift four. [abridged]

nonlinear predictive coding (FNPC) would code a frame in the procedure of
training to predict the frame samples. The motivating objective is to analyze
the system behavior in regenerating not only the envelope of spectra, but also
the spectra phase. This scheme has been evaluated in time and discrete cosine
transform (DCT) domains and the output of predicted phonemes show the
potentiality of the FNPC to reconstruct complicated signals. The experiments
were conducted on three voiced plosive phonemes, b/d/g/ in time and DCT domains
versus the number of neurons in the hidden layer. Experiments approve the FNPC
capability as an automatic coding system by which /b/d/g/ phonemes have been
reproduced with a good accuracy. Evaluations revealed that the performance of
FNPC system, trained to predict DCT coefficients is more desirable,
particularly for frames with the wider distribution of energy, compared to time

probabilities of symbols or blocks have been replaced with their relative

plug-in estimator can be easily demonstrated in the IID case. In this paper, we
ask whether the plug-in estimator can be used for consistent estimation of the
entropy rate $h$ of a stationary ergodic process. The answer is positive if, to
estimate block entropy of order $k$, we use a sample longer than
$2^{k(h+\epsilon)}$, whereas it is negative if we use a sample shorter than

is sufficient to use a sample of length $(|X|+\epsilon)^{k}$ where $|X|$ is the
alphabet size. The result is derived using $k$-block coding. As a by-product of
our technique, we also show that the block entropy of a stationary process is
bounded above by a nonlinear function of the average block entropy of its

investigated for their phase stability, short-range clustering (SRC) type
chemical ordering, other structural phenomena and and the effects on
strengthening. Ab-initio calculations have been done to determine the
thermodynamic stability parameters. The as-cast structures do not contain any
local chemical order, but the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) studies reveal their locally distorted lattice. The local lattice
distortion of the average structure in their as-cast and annealed state is
quantified by refining atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) from
single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) and powder neutron diffraction (ND)
studies. The static component of the ADPs appears to dominate over the thermal
ADP, suggesting a high degree of local lattice distortion in the HEAs. The
lattice distortions cause solid-solution like strengthening, which increases
the hardness of the HEAs by a factor of 2-3 compared to the rule of mixture.
The SRCs that form in the annealed HEAs have a planar profile perpendicular to
the <1 0 0> directions. The SRCs mainly are co-clustering of Zr and Hf. The
SRCs have a higher atomic volume causing local tetragonal lattice distortions,
which in terms produce diffuse streak-like intensities in the XRD datasets and
in the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the HRTEM lattice images. The presence
of SRCs locally reduces the lattice potential energy of the structure and puts
additional energy barrier to the movement of dislocations. This increases the
hardness causing around 50% of additional strengthening in the annealed HEAs.
Thermodynamic analysis shows that the relaxed structure containing the SRCs
lower the enthalpy and the configurational entropy.

lattice in the presence of nearest-neighbor $J_1$ and next-nearest-neighbor
$J_2$ antiferromagnetic couplings. Motivated by recent findings from
density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) claiming the existence of a gapped
spin liquid with signatures of spontaneously broken lattice point group
symmetry [Zhu and White, Phys. Rev. B 92, 041105 (2015); Hu, Gong, Zhu, and
Sheng, Phys. Rev. B 92, 140403 (2015)], we employ the variational Monte Carlo
(VMC) approach to analyze the model from an alternative perspective that
considers both magnetically ordered and paramagnetic trial states. We find a
quantum paramagnet in the regime $0.08\lesssim J_2/J_1\lesssim 0.16$, framed by
$120^{\circ}$ coplanar (stripe collinear) antiferromagnetic order for smaller
(larger) $J_2/J_1$. By considering the optimization of spin-liquid wave
functions of a different gauge group and lattice point group content as derived
from Abrikosov mean-field theory, we obtain the gapless $U(1)$ Dirac spin
liquid as the energetically most preferable state in comparison to all
symmetric or nematic gapped $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquids so far advocated by
DMRG. Moreover, by the application of few Lanczos iterations, we find the
energy to be the same as the DMRG result within error-bars. To further resolve
the intriguing disagreement between VMC and DMRG, we complement our
methodological approach by the pseudofermion functional renormalization group
(PFFRG) to compare the spin structure factors for the paramagnetic regime
calculated by VMC, DMRG, and PFFRG. This model promises to be an ideal test-bed
for future numerical refinements in tracking the long-range correlations in
frustrated magnets.

these conditions the Stokes problem has a non trivial kernel, we also study the
solutions lying in the orthogonal of that kernel. We prove the analyticity of

dependent Stokes problem with the Navier-type boundary condition under
different hypothesis on the initial data $\boldsymbol{u}_0$ and external force

several operators related with our Stokes operators. Using the fractional
powers, we prove maximal regularity results for the homogeneous Stokes problem.
On the other hand, using the boundedness of the pure imaginary powers we deduce
maximal $L^{p}-L^{q}$ regularity for the inhomogeneous Stokes problem.

aggregate wireless interference (AWI) in the downlink of K-tier heterogeneous

plane according to a (possibly non-homogeneous) Poisson process. The proposed
methodology is general enough to account for general bounded path-loss models
and fading statistics. The deviations of the distribution of the standardized
AWI from the standard normal distribution are measured in terms of the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance. An explicit expression bounding the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between these two distributions is obtained as a
function of a broad range of network parameters such as per-tier transmission
power levels, base station locations, fading statistics and the path-loss
model. A simulation study is performed to corroborate the analytical results.
In particular, a good statistical match between the standardized AWI
distribution and its normal approximation occurs even for moderately dense
heterogeneous cellular networks. These results are expected to have important
ramifications on the characterization of performance upper and lower bounds for
emerging 5G network architectures.

the fact that the space of quasi-symmetric functions is spanned by monomial

monomial quasi-symmetric functions and the resulting space of LWC

quasi-symmetric functions are obtained, generalizing the corresponding results
for quasi-symmetric functions. Extending the close relationship between
quasi-symmetric functions and multiple zeta values, weighted multiple zeta

attractive features of increased reliability, throughput, fault tolerance, and
load balancing capabilities. In particular, wireless environments and

multipathing for seamless handovers, virtual machine (VM) migration and in
general, pooling less proficient resources together for achieving overall high
proficiency. The transport layer, with its knowledge about end-to-end path
characteristics, is well placed to enhance performance through better
utilization of multiple paths. Realizing the importance of transport-layer
multipath, this paper investigates the modernization of traditional connection
establishment, flow control, sequence number splitting, acknowledgement, and
flow scheduling mechanisms for use with multiple paths. Since congestion
control defines a fundamental feature of the transport layer, we study the
working of multipath rate control and analyze its stability and convergence. We
also discuss how various multipath congestion control algorithms differ in
their window increase and decrease functions, their TCP-friendliness, and
responsiveness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth survey
paper that has chronicled the evolution of the transport layer of the Internet
from the traditional single-path TCP to the recent development of the modern

inherits properties from standard adaptive filters and from GA, is developed to
recursively estimate a rotor (multivector), a hypercomplex quantity able to
describe rotations in any dimension. The adaptive filter (AF) performance is
assessed via a 3D point-clouds registration problem, which contains a rotation
estimation step. Calculating the AF computational complexity suggests that it
can contribute to reduce the cost of a full-blown 3D registration algorithm,

estimating rotors in higher dimensions.

problem in coding theory that was recently answered in the affirmative for
transmission over erasure channels [1], [2]. Remarkably, the proof does not
rely on specific properties of RM codes, apart from their symmetry. Indeed, the
main technical result consists in showing that any sequence of linear codes,
with doubly-transitive permutation groups, achieves capacity on the memoryless
erasure channel under bit-MAP decoding. Thus, a natural question is what
happens under block-MAP decoding. In [1], [2], by exploiting further symmetries
of the code, the bit-MAP threshold was shown to be sharp enough so that the
block erasure probability also converges to 0. However, this technique relies
heavily on the fact that the transmission is over an erasure channel.
  We present an alternative approach to strengthen results regarding the
bit-MAP threshold to block-MAP thresholds. This approach is based on a careful
analysis of the weight distribution of RM codes. In particular, the flavor of
the main result is the following: assume that the bit-MAP error probability
decays as $N^{-\delta}$, for some $\delta>0$. Then, the block-MAP error
probability also converges to 0. This technique applies to transmission over
any binary memoryless symmetric channel. Thus, it can be thought of as a first
step in extending the proof that RM codes are capacity-achieving to the general
case.

used to access magnetic characteristics of the CMP, such as the field line
width $\Delta H$. By developing an effective oscillator model of the microwave

of harmonic coupling. At the same time, at the classical level the underlying
physical mechanism of the CMP is electrodynamic phase correlation and a second
model based on this principle also accurately reproduces the experimental line

solar-type hosts observed with NASA's Kepler satellite. Our results for $i_{\rm
s}$ are consistent with alignment at the 2-$\sigma$ level for all stars in the
sample, meaning that the system surrounding the red-giant star Kepler-56
remains as the only unambiguous misaligned multiple-planet system detected to
date. The availability of a measurement of the projected spin-orbit angle
$\lambda$ for two of the systems allows us to estimate $\psi$. We find that the
orbit of the hot-Jupiter HAT-P-7b is likely to be retrograde
($\psi=116.4^{+30.2}_{-14.7}\:{\rm deg}$), whereas that of Kepler-25c seems to
be well aligned with the stellar spin axis ($\psi=12.6^{+6.7}_{-11.0}\:{\rm

made previously in the literature that the multi-transiting system Kepler-25 is
misaligned, we show that the results are consistent, given the large associated
uncertainties. Finally, we perform a hierarchical Bayesian analysis based on
the asteroseismic sample in order to recover the underlying distribution of
$\psi$. The ensemble analysis suggests that the directions of the stellar spin

host stars to display large inclination values.

typically less than 20 photons per pixel). The model represents each Lidar
waveform as an unknown constant background level, which is combined in the
presence of a target, to a known impulse response weighted by the target
intensity and finally corrupted by Poisson noise. The joint target detection
and depth imaging problem is expressed as a pixel-wise model selection and
estimation problem which is solved using Bayesian inference. Prior knowledge
about the problem is embedded in a hierarchical model that describes the
dependence structure between the model parameters while accounting for their
constraints. In particular, Markov random fields (MRFs) are used to model the
joint distribution of the background levels and of the target presence labels,
which are both expected to exhibit significant spatial correlations. An
adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm including reversible-jump updates
is then proposed to compute the Bayesian estimates of interest. This algorithm
is equipped with a stochastic optimization adaptation mechanism that
automatically adjusts the parameters of the MRFs by maximum marginal likelihood
estimation. Finally, the benefits of the proposed methodology are demonstrated
through a series of experiments using real data.

subgrid models for radiative cooling, star formation, stellar mass loss, and
feedback from stars and accreting black holes. They have been shown to
reproduce the observed galaxy population with unprecedented fidelity. We
combine the merger rates of supermassive black holes in EAGLE with the latest
phenomenological waveform models to calculate the gravitational waves signals
from the intrinsic parameters of the merging black holes. The EAGLE models
predict $\sim2$ detections per year by a gravitational wave detector such as
eLISA. We find that these signals are largely dominated by mergers between seed
mass black holes merging at redshifts between $z\sim2$ and $z\sim1$. In order
to investigate the dependence on the assumed black hole seed mass, we introduce
an additional model with a black hole seed mass an order of magnitude smaller
than in our reference model. We also consider a variation of the reference
model where a prescription for the expected delays in the black hole merger
timescale has been included after their host galaxies merge. We find that the
merger rate is similar in all models, but that the initial black hole seed mass
could be distinguished through their detected gravitational waveforms. Hence,
the characteristic gravitational wave signals detected by eLISA will provide
profound insight into the origin of supermassive black holes and the initial

breaking solitary waves on a sloping bottom is studied. To validate the
numerical model the simulation results are compared with those obtained by
Grilli et al.[16] and a good agreement between them is observed. Shoaling of
solitary waves of two different types of mild slope model systems in [8] and
[13] are compared, and it is found that each of these models works well in
their respective regimes of applicability.

  and other emerging infectious diseases",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Dynamic models - often deterministic in nature - were used to estimate the
basic reproductive number, R_0, of the 2014-5 Ebola virus disease (EVD)
epidemic outbreak in West Africa. Estimates of R_0 were then used to project
the likelihood for large outbreak sizes, e.g., exceeding hundreds of thousands
of cases. Yet fitting deterministic models can lead to over-confidence in the
confidence intervals of the fitted R_0, and, in turn, the type and scope of
necessary interventions. In this manuscript we propose a hybrid
stochastic-deterministic method to estimate R_0 and associated confidence
intervals (CIs). The core idea is that stochastic realizations of an underlying
deterministic model can be used to evaluate the compatibility of candidate
values of R_0 with observed epidemic curves. The compatibility is based on
comparing the distribution of expected epidemic growth rates with the observed
epidemic growth rate given ""process noise"", i.e., arising due to stochastic
transmission, recovery and death events. By applying our method to reported EVD
case counts from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, we show that prior estimates
of R_0 based on deterministic fits appear to be more confident than analysis of
stochastic trajectories suggests should be possible. Moving forward, we
recommend including a hybrid stochastic-deterministic fitting procedure when
quantifying the full R_0 CI at the onset of an epidemic due to multiple sources
of noise.

providing an estimate on the global energy dissipation in the machine, in this

about their original formation environment. The organic materials in primitive
solar system bodies have generally higher D/H ratios and show greater D/H
variation when compared to D/H in solar system water. We propose this
difference arises at least in part due to 1) the availability of additional
chemical fractionation pathways for organics beyond that for water, and 2) the
higher volatility of key carbon reservoirs compared to oxygen. We test this
hypothesis using detailed disk models, including a sophisticated, new disk
ionization treatment with a low cosmic ray ionization rate, and find that disk
chemistry leads to higher deuterium enrichment in organics compared to water,
helped especially by fractionation via the precursors CH$_2$D$^+$/CH$_3^+$. We
also find that the D/H ratio in individual species varies significantly
depending on their particular formation pathways. For example, from $\sim20-40$
AU, CH$_4$ can reach $\rm{D/H\sim2\times10^{-3}}$, while D/H in CH$_3$OH
remains locally unaltered. Finally, while the global organic D/H in our models
can reproduce intermediately elevated D/H in the bulk hydrocarbon reservoir,
our models are unable to reproduce the most deuterium-enriched organic
materials in the solar system, and thus our model requires some inheritance
from the cold interstellar medium from which the Sun formed.

when the measured outputs and control inputs are subject to event-triggered
sampling and dynamic quantization. A new sampling algorithm is proposed for
outputs which does not lead to accumulation of sampling times and results in
asymptotic stabilization of the system. The approach for output sampling is
based on defining an event function that compares the difference between the
current output and the most recently transmitted output sample not only with
the current value of the output, but also takes into account a certain number
of previously transmitted output samples. This allows us to reconstruct the
state using an observer with sample-and-hold measurements. The estimated states
are used to generate a control input, which is subjected to a different
event-triggered sampling routine; hence the sampling times of inputs and
outputs are asynchronous. Using Lyapunov-based approach, we prove the
asymptotic stabilization of the closed-loop system and show that there exists a
minimum inter-sampling time for control inputs and for outputs. To show that
these sampling routines are robust with respect to transmission errors, only
the quantized (in space) values of outputs and inputs are transmitted to the
controller and the plant, respectively. A dynamic quantizer is adopted for this
purpose, and an algorithm is proposed to update the range and the centre of the
quantizer that results in an asymptotically stable closed-loop system.

We first obtain such random Point Distance Distributions (PDDs) associated with

and that between two triangles sharing either a common side or a common vertex.
For each case, we provide an algorithmic procedure showing the mathematical
derivation process, based on which either the closed-form expressions or the
algorithmic results can be obtained. The obtained triangle-PDDs can be utilized
for modeling and analyzing the wireless communication networks associated with
triangle geometries, such as sensor networks with triangle-shaped clusters and
triangle-shaped cellular systems with highly directional antennas. Furthermore,
based on the obtained triangle-PDDs, we then show how to obtain the PDDs
associated with arbitrary polygons through the decomposition and recursion
approach, since any polygons can be triangulated, and any geometry shapes can
be approximated by polygons with a needed precision. Finally, we give the PDDs
associated with ring geometries. The results shown in this report can enrich
and expand the theory and application of the probabilistic distance models for
the analysis of wireless communication networks.
