  the case of NGC4458","10 pages, 8 figures. Accepted for publication on MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stw099",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Approximately 20% of early-type galaxies host small nuclear stellar discs
that are tens to a few hundred parsecs in size. Such discs are expected to be
easily disrupted during major galactic encounters, hence their age serve to
constrain their assembly history. We use VIMOS integral-field spectroscopic
observations for the intermediate-mass E0 galaxy NGC4458 and age-date its
nuclear disc via high-resolution fitting of various model spectra. We find that
the nuclear disc is at least 6 Gyr old. A clue to gain narrow limits to the
stellar age is our knowledge of the nuclear disc contribution to the central
surface brightness.
  The presence of an old nuclear disk, or the absence of disruptive encounters
since z~0.6, for a small galaxy such as NGC4458 which belongs to the Virgo
cluster, may be consistent with a hierarchical picture for galaxy formation
where the smallest galaxies assembles earlier and the crowded galactic
environments reduce the incidence of galaxy mergers. On the other hand, NGC4458
displays little or no bulk rotation except for a central kpc-scale
kinematically-decoupled core. Slow rotation and decoupled core are usually
explained in terms of mergers. The presence and age of the nuclear disc
constraint these mergers to have happened at high redshift.

scale in the two-index symmetric (sextet) representation of the BSM SU(3) color
gauge group (bsm-color). The intriguing possibility of near-conformal sextet
gauge dynamics could lead to the minimal realization of the composite Higgs
mechanism with a light $0^{++}$ scalar, far separated from strongly coupled
resonances of the confining gauge force in the 2-3 TeV range, distinct from
Higgsless Technicolor. In previous publications we have presented results for
the meson spectrum of the theory, including the light composite scalar, perhaps
the emergent Higgs impostor. Here we discuss the critically important role of
the baryon spectrum in the sextet model investigating its compatibility with
what we know about thermal evolution of the early Universe including its
galactic and terrestrial relics. For an important application, we report the
first numerical results on the baryon spectrum of this theory from
non-perturbative lattice simulations with baryon correlators in the staggered
fermion implementation of the strongly coupled gauge sector. The quantum
numbers of composite baryons and their spectroscopy from lattice simulations

simple crystal lattices, all of these models assume central-force interactions
between particles/atoms. Each of these models differs in the spatial
arrangement and the correlations among particles. In turn, this is reflected in
the widely different behaviours of the shear (G) and compression (K) elastic
moduli. The relation between the macroscopic elasticity as encoded in G, K and
their ratio, and the microscopic lattice structure/order, is not understood. We
provide a quantitative analytical connection between the local orientational
order and the elasticity in model amorphous solids with different internal
microstructure, focusing on the two opposite limits of packings (strong
excluded-volume) and networks (no excluded-volume). The theory predicts that,
in packings, the local orientational order due to excluded-volume causes less
nonaffinity (less softness or larger stiffness) under compression than under
shear. This leads to lower values of G/K, a well-documented phenomenon which
was lacking a microscopic explanation. The theory also provides an excellent
one-parameter description of the elasticity of compressed emulsions in
comparison with experimental data over a broad range of packing fractions.

introduced by Newman and Girvan (2004). Community detection in graphs is now
often conducted through modularity maximization: given an undirected graph
$G=(V,E)$, we are asked to find a partition $\mathcal{C}$ of $V$ that maximizes
the modularity. Although numerous algorithms have been developed to date, most
of them have no theoretical approximation guarantee. Recently, to overcome this
issue, the design of modularity maximization algorithms with provable
approximation guarantees has attracted significant attention in the computer
science community.
  In this study, we further investigate the approximability of modularity
maximization. More specifically, we propose a polynomial-time
$\left(\cos\left(\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{4}\pi\right) -
\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{8}\right)$-additive approximation algorithm for the
modularity maximization problem. Note here that
$\cos\left(\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{4}\pi\right) - \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{8} < 0.42084$
holds. This improves the current best additive approximation error of $0.4672$,
which was recently provided by Dinh, Li, and Thai (2015). Interestingly, our
analysis also demonstrates that the proposed algorithm obtains a nearly-optimal
solution for any instance with a very high modularity value. Moreover, we
propose a polynomial-time $0.16598$-additive approximation algorithm for the
maximum modularity cut problem. It should be noted that this is the first
non-trivial approximability result for the problem. Finally, we demonstrate
that our approximation algorithm can be extended to some related problems.

most probable physical mechanism to explain the optical variability in this LC
class is time-dependent mass accretion onto the stellar photosphere, producing
transient hot spots. As evidence in favor of this hypothesis, multi-epoch high
resolution spectra for a subset of these stars shows that their veiling levels
also vary in time and that this veiling variability is consistent in both
amplitude and timescale with the optical LC morphology. Furthermore, the
veiling variability is well-correlated with the strength of the HeI 6678A
emission line, a feature predicted by models to arise in accretion shocks on or
near the stellar photosphere. Stars with accretion burst LC morphology
(Stauffer et al. 2014) are also attributed to variable mass accretion. Both the
stochastic and accretion burst LCs can be explained by a simple model of
randomly occurring flux bursts, with the stochastic LC class having a higher
frequency of lower amplitude events. Based on their UV excesses, veiling, and
mean Ha equivalent widths, members of the stochastic LC class have only
moderate time-averaged mass accretion rates. The most common feature of their
Ha profiles is for them to exhibit blue-shifted absorption features, most
likely originating in a disk wind. The lack of periodic signatures in the LCs
suggests that little of the variability is due to long-lived hot spots rotating
into or out of our line of sight; instead, the primary driver of the observed
photometric variability is likely to be instabilities in the inner disk that
lead to variable mass accretion.

  In this work, we applied a selection strategy to find new, uncatalogued hot
subdwarfs making use of VO tools. We used large area catalogues (GALEX, SDSS,
SuperCosmos, 2MASS) to retrieve photometric and astrometric information of
stellar objects. To these objects, we applied colour and proper motion filters,
together with an effective temperature cutoff, aimed at separating hot
subdwarfs from other blue objects such as white dwarfs, cataclysmic variables
or main sequence OB stars. As a result, we obtained 437 new, uncatalogued hot
subdwarf candidates. Based on previous results, we expect our procedure to have
an overall efficiency of at least 80 per cent. Visual inspection of the 68
candidates with SDSS spectrum showed that 65 can be classified as hot
subdwarfs: 5 sdOs, 25 sdOBs and 35 sdBs. This success rate above 95 per cent
proves the robustness and efficiency of our methodology.
  The spectral energy distribution of 45 per cent of the subdwarf candidates
showed infrared excesses, a signature of their probable binary nature. The
stellar companions of the binary systems so detected are expected to be
late-type main sequence stars. A detailed determination of temperatures and
spectral classification of the cool companions will be presented in a

document to a namespace. At the moment, there does not exist a special dataset
where all identifiers are grouped to namespaces, and therefore we need to
create such a dataset ourselves.
  To do that, we need to find groups of documents that use identifiers in the
same way. This can be done with cluster analysis methods. We argue that
documents can be represented by the identifiers they contain, and this approach
is similar to representing textual information in the Vector Space Model.
Because of this, we can apply traditional document clustering techniques for
namespace discovery.
  Because the problem is new, there is no gold standard dataset, and it is hard
to evaluate the performance of our method. To overcome it, we first use Java
source code as a dataset for our experiments, since it contains the namespace
information. We verify that our method can partially recover namespaces from
source code using only information about identifiers.
  The algorithms are evaluated on the English Wikipedia, and the proposed
method can extract namespaces on a variety of topics. After extraction, the
namespaces are organized into a hierarchical structure by using existing
classification schemes such as MSC, PACS and ACM. We also apply it to the
Russian Wikipedia, and the results are consistent across the languages.
  To our knowledge, the problem of introducing namespaces to mathematics has
not been studied before, and prior to our work there has been no dataset where
identifiers are grouped into namespaces. Thus, our result is not only a good
start, but also a good indicator that automatic namespace discovery is

focus almost exclusively on the local properties of spacetime, such as the
locally Euclidean structure of the manifold and the Lorentzian signature of the
metric tensor. When combined with the classical Einstein field equations this
gives an extremely successful empirical model of classical gravity and
classical matter --- at least as long as one does not ask too many awkward
questions about global issues, (such as global topology and global causal
structure). We feel however that this is a tactical error --- even without
invoking full-fledged ""quantum gravity"" we know that the standard model of
particle physics is also an extremely good representation of some parts of
empirical reality; and we had better be able to carry over all the good
features of the standard model of particle physics --- at least into the realm
of semi-classical quantum gravity. Doing so gives us some interesting global
features that spacetime should possess: On physical grounds spacetime should be
space-orientable, time-orientable, and spacetime-orientable, and it should
possess a globally defined tetrad (vierbein, or in general a globally defined
vielbein/n-bein). So on physical grounds spacetime should be parallelizable.
This strongly suggests that the metric is not the fundamental physical
quantity; a very good case can be made for the tetrad being more fundamental
than the metric. Furthermore, a globally-defined ""almost complex structure"" is
almost unavoidable. Ideas along these lines have previously been mooted, but

desirable for diode-based applications and transistor technology. Copper
nitride (Cu3N) is a metastable semiconductor with a solar-relevant bandgap that
has been reported to exhibit bipolar doping behavior. However, deeper
understanding and better control of the mechanism behind this behavior in Cu3N
is currently lacking in the literature. In this work, we use combinatorial
growth with a temperature gradient to demonstrate both conduction types of
phase-pure, sputter-deposited Cu3N thin films. Room temperature Hall effect and
Seebeck effect measurements show n-type Cu3N with 10^17 electrons/cm^3 for low
growth temperature (~35 degrees C) and p-type with 10^15-10^16 holes/cm^3 for
elevated growth temperatures (50-120 degrees C). Mobility for both types of
Cu3N was ~0.1-1 cm^2/Vs. Additionally, temperature- dependent Hall effect
measurements indicate that ionized defects are an important scattering
mechanism in p-type films. By combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy and
first-principles defect theory, we determined that V_Cu defects form
preferentially in p-type Cu3N while Cu_i defects form preferentially in n-type
Cu3N. Based on these theoretical and experimental results, we propose a kinetic
defect formation mechanism for bipolar doping in Cu3N, that is also supported
by positron annihilation experiments. Overall, the results of this work
highlight the importance of kinetic processes in the defect physics of
metastable materials, and provide a framework that can be applied when
considering the properties of such materials in general.

architecture. However, the principles are often lost when it comes to an
implementation of services, as a result of a rigidly defined service interface.
The interface, which defines a data format, is typically specific to a
particular context and its change entails significant redevelopment costs. This
paper focuses on a two-fold problem. On the one hand, the interface description
language must be flexible enough for maintaining service compatibility in a
variety of different contexts without modification of the service itself. On
the other hand, the composition of interfaces in a distributed environment must
be provably consistent. The existing approaches for checking compatibility of
service choreographies are either inflexible (WS-CDL and WSCI) or require
behaviour specification associated with each service, which is often impossible
to provide in practice.
  We present a novel approach for automatic interface configuration in
distributed stream-connected components operating as closed-source services
(i.e. the behavioural protocol is unknown). We introduce a Message Definition
Language (MDL), which can extend the existing interfaces description languages,
such as WSDL, with support of subtyping, inheritance and polymorphism. The MDL
supports configuration variables that link input and output interfaces of a
service and propagate requirements over an application graph. We present an
algorithm that solves the interface reconciliation problem using constraint
satisfaction that relies on Boolean satisfiability as a subproblem.

indicate that galaxies with the highest and lowest observed ionization levels

stress is adiabatically applied on them. Thus far, only ferroelectrics and
superelastic metallic alloys have been considered as potential mechanocaloric
compounds to be exploited in solid-state cooling applications. Here we show
that giant mechanocaloric effects occur in hitherto overlooked fast ion
conductors (FIC), a class of multicomponent materials in which above a critical
temperature, Ts, a constituent ionic species undergoes a sudden increase in
mobility. Using first-principles and molecular dynamics simulations, we found
that the superionic transition in fluorite-structured FIC, which is
characterised by a large entropy increase of the order of 100 J/K*Kg, can be
externally tuned with hydrostatic, biaxial or uniaxial stresses. In particular,
Ts can be reduced several hundreds of degrees through the application of
moderate tensile stresses due to the concomitant drop in the formation energy
of Frenkel pair defects. We predict that the adiabatic temperature change in
CaF2 and PbF2, two archetypal fluorite-structured FIC, close to their critical
points are of the order of 100 and 10 K, respectively. This work advocates that
FIC constitute a new family of mechanocaloric materials showing great promise
for prospective solid-state refrigeration applications.

late M-dwarf, VHS J125601.92-125723.9 (VHS 1256-1257). The companion's absolute
photometry suggests its mass and atmosphere are similar to the HR 8799 planets.
However, as a wide companion to a late-type star, it is more accessible to
spectroscopic characterization. We discovered that the primary of this system
is an equal-magnitude binary. For an age $\sim300$ Myr the A and B components
each have a mass of $64.6^{+0.8}_{-2.0}~M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$, and the b component
has a mass of $11.2^{+9.7}_{-1.8}$, making VHS 1256-1257 only the third brown
dwarf triple system. There exists some tension between the spectrophotometric
distance of $17.2\pm2.6$ pc and the parallax distance of $12.7\pm1.0$ pc. At
12.7 pc VHS1256-1257 A and B would be the faintest known M7.5 objects, and are
even faint outliers among M8 types. If the larger spectrophotmetric distance is
more accurate than the parallax, then the mass of each component increases. In
particular, the mass of the b component increases well above the deuterium
burning limit to $\sim35~M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ and the mass of each binary
component increases to $73^{+20}_{-17}~M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. At 17.1 pc, the UVW
kinematics of the system are consistent with membership in the AB~Dor moving
group. The architecture of the system resembles a hierarchical stellar multiple
suggesting it formed via an extension of the star-formation process to low
masses. Continued astrometric monitoring will resolve this distance uncertainty
and will provide dynamical masses for a new benchmark system.

that (1) Root ORAM can reduce local storage overhead by about 2x for a
reasonable values of privacy budget, significantly enhancing performance in
memory limited platforms such as trusted execution environments, and (2) Root
ORAM allows tunable trade-offs between bandwidth, storage, and privacy,
reducing bandwidth overheads by up to 2x-10x (at the cost of increased

latencies for cloud environments. We also analyze the privacy guarantees of

that the data in each channel are sequentially observed and follow a general
non-i.i.d. stochastic model. Under the assumption that the local log-likelihood
ratio processes in the channels converge r-completely to positive and finite
numbers, we establish the asymptotic optimality of a generalized sequential
likelihood ratio test and a mixture-based sequential likelihood ratio test.
Specifically, we show that both tests minimize the first r moments of the
stopping time distribution asymptotically as the probabilities of false alarm
and missed detection approach zero. Moreover, we show that both tests
asymptotically minimize all moments of the stopping time distribution when the
local log-likelihood ratio processes have independent increments and simply
obey the Strong Law of Large Numbers. This extends a result previously known in
the case of i.i.d. observations when only one channel is affected. We
illustrate the general detection theory using several practical examples,
including the detection of signals in Gaussian hidden Markov models, white
Gaussian noises with unknown intensity, and testing of the first-order
autoregression's correlation coefficient. Finally, we illustrate the
feasibility of both sequential tests when assuming an upper and a lower bound
on the number of signals and compare their non-asymptotic performance using a

important role of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in understanding the
early production and ejection of carbon in the Galaxy and in identifying the
progenitors of the CEMP stars among the first stars formed after the Big Bang.
Recent work has also classified the CEMP stars by absolute carbon abundance,
A(C), into high- and low-C bands, mostly populated by binary and single stars,
respectively. Our aim is to determine the frequency and orbital parameters of
binary systems among the CEMP-s stars, which exhibit strong enhancements of
neutron-capture elements associated with the s-process. This allows us to test
whether local mass transfer from a binary companion is necessary and sufficient
to explain their dramatic carbon excesses. Eighteen of the 22 stars exhibit
clear orbital motion, yielding a binary frequency of 82+-10%, while four stars
appear to be single (18+-10%). We thus confirm that the binary frequency of
CEMP-s stars is much higher than for normal metal-poor giants, but not 100% as
previously claimed. Secure orbits are determined for 11 of the binaries and
provisional orbits for six long-period systems (P > 3,000 days), and orbital
circularisation time scales are discussed. The conventional scenario of local
mass transfer from a former AGB binary companion does appear to account for the
chemical composition of most CEMP-s stars. However, the excess of C and
s-process elements in some single CEMP-s stars was apparently transferred to
their natal clouds by an external (distant) source. This finding has important
implications for our understanding of carbon enrichment in the early Galactic
halo and some high-redshift DLA systems, and of the mass loss from extremely
metal-poor AGB stars. Abridged.

centre of a filament have higher stellar masses than their counterparts near
the periphery of filaments, on the edges of voids. In addition, these
peripheral spiral galaxies have higher specific star formation rates (SSFR) at
a given mass. Complementing our sample of filament spiral galaxies with spiral
galaxies in tendrils and voids, we find that the average SFR of these objects
in different large scale environments are similar to each other with the
primary discriminant in SFR being stellar mass, in line with previous works.
However, the distributions of SFRs are found to vary with large-scale
environment. Our results thus suggest a model in which in addition to stellar
mass as the primary discriminant, the large-scale environment is imprinted in
the SFR as a second order effect. Furthermore, our detailed results for
filament galaxies suggest a model in which gas accretion from voids onto

Cluster - one of the three massive star clusters in the Galactic Center region.
Previous studies indicated that WR 102c may have a dusty circumstellar nebula
and is among the main ionizing sources of the Sickle Nebula associated with the
Quintuplet cluster. We obtained observations with the ESO's VLT integral field
spectrograph SINFONI in the K-band, extracted the stellar spectra, and analyzed
them by means of stellar atmosphere models. Our new analysis supersedes the
results reported for WR 102c previously. We significantly revise down its
bolometric luminosity and hydrogen content. We detect four early OB type stars
close to WR 102c. These stars have radial velocities similar to that of WR
102c. We suggest that together with WR 102c these stars belong to a distinct
star cluster with a total mass of about 1000 M_sun. We identify a new WR nebula
around WR 102c in the SINFONI map of the diffuse Br$\gamma$ emission and in the
HST's Pa$\alpha$ images. The Br$\gamma$ line at different locations is not
significantly broadened and similar to the width of nebular emission elsewhere
in the H II region around WR 102c. The massive star WR 102c located in the
Galactic Center region resides in a star cluster containing further early type
stars. The stellar parameters of WR 102c are typical for hydrogen-free WN6
stars. We newly identify a nebula surrounding WR 102c that has a morphology
similar to other nebulae around hydrogen-free WR stars, and propose that the
formation of this nebula is linked to interaction of the fast stellar wind with
the matter ejected at previous evolutionary stage of WR 102c.

variations occur near periastron. Most notably, near periastron the He II
$\lambda 4686$ line increases rapidly in strength, drops to a minimum value,
then increases briefly before fading away. To understand this behavior, we
conducted an intense spectroscopic monitoring of the He II $\lambda 4686$
emission line across the 2014.6 periastron passage using ground- and
space-based telescopes. Comparison with previous data confirmed the overall
repeatability of EW(He II $\lambda 4686$), the line radial velocities, and the
timing of the minimum, though the strongest peak was systematically larger in
2014 than in 2009 by 26%. The EW(He II $\lambda 4686$) variations, combined
with other measurements, yield an orbital period $2022.7\pm0.3$ d. The observed
variability of the EW(He II $\lambda 4686$) was reproduced by a model in which
the line flux primarily arises at the apex of the wind-wind collision and
scales inversely with the square of the stellar separation, if we account for
the excess emission as the companion star plunges into the hot inner layers of
the primary's atmosphere, and including absorption from the disturbed primary
wind between the source and the observer. This model constrains the orbital
inclination to $135^\circ$-$153^\circ$, and the longitude of periastron to
$234^\circ$-$252^\circ$. It also suggests that periastron passage occurred on
$T_0 = 2456874.4\pm1.3$ d. Our model also reproduced EW(He II $\lambda 4686$)
variations from a polar view of the primary star as determined from the
observed He II $\lambda 4686$ emission scattered off the Homunculus nebula.

backreaction of the sgoldstino, the other from the heavy fields generating its

which makes a consistent decoupling of the sgoldstino nontrivial. Still, we
identify a parameter window in which sgoldstino-less inflation can take place,

(random and correlated with local gas density). In order to isolate the physics
of SN feedback, we do not include additional feedback processes. We find that,
in these local box calculations, SN feedback excites relatively low
mass-weighted gas turbulent velocity dispersions ~3-7 km/s and low wind mass
loading factors < 1 in all the cases we study. The low turbulent velocities and
wind mass loading factors predicted by our local box calculations are
significantly below those suggested by observations of gas-rich and rapidly
star-forming galaxies; they are also in tension with global simulations of disc
galaxies regulated by stellar feedback. Using a combination of numerical tests
and analytic arguments, we argue that local Cartesian boxes cannot predict the
properties of galactic winds because they do not capture the correct global
geometry and gravitational potential of galaxies. The wind mass loading factors
are in fact not well-defined in local simulations because they decline
significantly with increasing box height. More physically realistic
calculations (e.g., including a global galactic potential and disc rotation)

comparing the gas masses obtained from inverting the star-formation law with

region, in the cuprates, and in the quasi-two dimensional Fe-based
superconductors and heavy-fermion compounds, have the same temperature
dependences. This can occur only if, despite their vast microscopic
differences, a common statistical mechanical model describes their phase
transitions. The antiferromagnetic (AFM)-ic models for the latter two, just as
the loop-current model for the cuprates, map to the dissipative XY model. The
solution of this model in 2+1 D reveals that the critical fluctuations are
determined by topological excitations, vortices and a variety of instantons,
and not by renormalized spin-wave theories of the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson type,
adapted by Moriya, Hertz and others for quantum-criticality. The absorptive
part of the fluctuations is a separable function of momentum ${\bf q}$,
measured from the ordering vector, and of the frequency $\omega$ and the
temperature $T$ which scale as $\tanh(\omega/2T)$ at criticality. Direct
measurements of the fluctuations by neutron scattering in the
quasi-two-dimensional heavy fermion and Fe-based compounds, near their
antiferromagnetic quantum critical point, are consistent with this form. Such
fluctuations, together with the vertex coupling them to fermions, lead to a
marginal fermi-liquid, with the imaginary part of the self-energy $\propto
max(\omega, T)$ for all momenta, a resistivity $\propto T$, a $T \ln T$
contribution to the specific heat, and other singular fermi-liquid properties
common to these diverse compounds, as well as to d-wave superconductivity. This
is explicitly verified, in the cuprates, by analysis of the pairing and the
normal self-energy directly extracted from the recent high resolution angle
resolved photoemission measurements.

can form decretion disks, and offers observational support for theoretical
predictions that the hottest, fastest rotators can generate He$^+$-ionizing

earlier than O7.5e with strong disk emission. We find that in the SMC, Oe stars
extend to earlier spectral types than in the MW, and our SMC Oe/O frequency,
$0.26\pm0.04$, is much greater than the MW value, $0.03\pm0.01$. These results
are consistent with angular momentum transport by stronger winds suppressing
decretion disk formation at higher metallicity. In addition, our SMC field Oe
star frequency is indistinguishable from that for clusters, which is consistent
with the similarity between rotation rates in these environments, and contrary
to the pattern for MW rotation rates. Thus, our findings strongly support the
viscous decretion disk model and confirm that Oe stars are the high-mass
extension of the Be phenomenon. Additionally, we find that Fe~\textsc{ii}

couplings is known to grow as the logarithm of the block size, in similarity to
conformal systems. In this work we study random spin chains whose couplings
present long range correlations, generated as gaussian fields with a power-law
spectral function. Ground states are always planar valence bond states, and
their statistical ensembles are characterized in terms of their block entropy
and their bond-length distribution, which follow power-laws. We conjecture the
existence of a critical value for the spectral exponent, below which the system
behavior is identical to the case of uncorrelated couplings. Above that
critical value, the entanglement entropy violates the area law and grows as a
power law of the block size, with an exponent which increases from zero to one.
Similar planar bond structures are also found in statistical models of RNA
folding and kinetic roughening, and we trace an analogy between them and
quantum valence bond states. Using an inverse renormalization procedure we
determine the optimal spin-chain couplings which give rise to a given planar
bond structure, and study the statistical properties of the couplings whose
bond structures mimic those found in RNA folding.

supersymmetry breaking appears directly from certain world-volume fermions
becoming massive. In fact this turns out to be a generic property even if we
change the dimensionality of the anti-brane, or allow higher order fermionic

constructing an all order fermionic action for the anti-D3-brane from which the
spontaneous nature of supersymmetry breaking can be demonstrated by bringing it

  Aug 2017 addendum: This article was originally written with multiple
audiences in mind. It is really best put in the following terms. Goertzel,
Hutter, Legg, and others have developed a definition of an intelligence score
for a general abstract agent: expected lifetime reward in a random environment.
AIXI is generally the optimal agent according to this score, but there may be
reasons to analyze other agents and compare score values. If we want to use
this definition of intelligence in practice, perhaps we can start by analyzing
some simple agents. Common algorithms can be thought of as simple agents
(environment is input, reward is based on running time) so we take the goal of
applying the agent intelligence score to algorithms. That is, we want to find,
what are the IQ scores of algorithms? We can do some very simple analysis, but
the real answer is that even for simple algorithms, the intelligence score is
too difficult to work with in practice.

diverging length scales associated with zero- and finite-energy vibrational

predicted by CITE and compare it to the neutrino burst of SN1987A. For strong
CCSNe, as SN1987A, CITE predicts a proto-neutron star (PNS) accretion phase,
accompanied by the corresponding neutrino luminosity, that can last a few
seconds and that is cut-off abruptly by black hole (BH) formation. The neutrino
luminosity can later be revived by accretion disc emission after a dead time of
few to a few ten seconds. In contrast, the neutrino mechanism for CCSNe
predicts a shorter PNS accretion phase, followed by a slowly declining PNS
cooling luminosity. We repeat statistical analyses used in the literature to
interpret the neutrino mechanism, and apply them to CITE. The first 1-2 sec of
the neutrino burst are equally compatible with CITE and with the neutrino
mechanism. However, the data hints to a luminosity drop at t=2-3 sec, in some
tension with the neutrino mechanism while being naturally attributed to BH
formation in CITE. The occurrence of neutrino events at 5 sec in SN1987A
suggests that the accretion disc formed by that time. We perform 2D numerical
simulations, showing that CITE may be able to accommodate this disc formation
time while reproducing the ejected $^{56}$Ni mass and ejecta kinetic energy
within factors 2-3 of observations. We estimate the disc neutrino luminosity
and show that it can roughly match the data. This suggests that direct BH
formation is compatible with the neutrino burst of SN1987A. With current
neutrino detectors, the neutrino burst of the next Galactic CCSN may give us
front-row seats to the formation of an event horizon in real time. Access to
phenomena near the event horizon motivates the construction of a few Megaton

varying noise level of ~0.3-1 mJy/beam. The catalog contains ~4400 sources.
Around 1200 of these are spatially resolved, and ~1000 are possible artifacts,
given their low signal-to-noise ratios. Since the spatial distribution of the
unresolved objects is evenly distributed and not confined to the Galactic
plane, most of them are extragalactic. Thanks to the broad bandwidth of the
observations from 1 to 2 GHz, we are able to determine a reliable spectral
index for ~1800 sources. The spectral index distribution reveals a
double-peaked profile with maxima at spectral indices of alpha = -1 and alpha =
0 , corresponding to steep declining and flat spectra, respectively. This
allows us to distinguish between thermal and non-thermal emission, which can be
used to determine the nature of each source. We examine the spectral index of
~300 known HII regions, for which we find thermal emission with spectral
indices around alpha = 0. In contrast, supernova remnants (SNR) show
non-thermal emission with alpha = -0.5 and extragalactic objects generally have
a steeper spectral index of alpha = -1. Using the spectral index information of

a high-order discontinuous element-based collocation discretization of the

splitting of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The ill-posedness of
the Poisson-Neumann system manifests as an inconsistency of the Schur
complement problem, but it is shown that this can be accounted for with
appropriate projections out of the null space of the Schur complement matrix
without affecting the accuracy of the solution. The block-Jacobi
preconditioner, combined with deflation, is shown to yield GMRES convergence
independent of the polynomial order of expansion within an element. Finally,
while the number of GMRES iterations does grow as the element size is reduced
(e.g. $h$-refinement), the dependence is very mild; the number of GMRES
iterations roughly doubles as the element size is divided by a factor of six.
In light of these numerical results, the deflated Schur complement approach
seems practicable, especially for high-order methods given its convergence
independent of polynomial order.

and CDF have been numerically evaluated since MI depends on the quotient of two
Wishart matrices, and no closed-form for this quotient was available.
  We derive exact results for the PDF and CDF of extreme (the smallest/the
largest) eigenvalues. Based on the results of quotient ensemble the exact
calculation for PDF and CDF of mutual information is presented via Laplace
transform approach and by direct integration of joint PDF of quotient
ensemble's eigenvalues. Furthermore, our derivations also provide the
parameters to apply the Gaussian approximation method, which is comparatively
easier to implement. We show that approximation matches the exact results
remarkably well for outage probability, i.e. CDF, above 10%. However, the
approximation could also be used for 1% outage probability with a relatively
small error.
  We apply the derived expressions to analyze the effects of adding receiving
antennas on the receiver's performance. By supposing no channel knowledge at
transmitters and successive decoding at receiver, the capacity of the first
user increases and outage probability decreases with extra antennas, as
expected.

All Type I SNe become undetectable within 3 years of explosion. About
22$\pm$11% of Type II SNe continue to be detected at late-times. Dust
luminosity, temperature, and a lower liit on mass are obtained by fitting the
SED using photometry with IRAC bands 1 and 2. The mass estimate does not
distinguish between pre-existing and newly produced dust. We observe warm dust
masses between $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-6}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ and dust temperatures
from 200 K to 1280 K.We present detailed case studies of two extreme Type II-P
SNe: SN 2011ja and 2014bi. SN 2011ja was over-luminous ([4.5] = -15.6 mag) at
900 days post-explosion accompanied by the growing dust mass. This suggests
either an episode of dust formation or an intensifying CSM interactions heating
up pre-existing dust. SN 2014bi showed a factor of 10 decrease in dust mass
over one month suggesting either an episode of dust destruction or a fading
source of dust heating. A rebrightening of the Type Ib SN 2014C is observed and
attributed to CSM interactions. This observation adds to a small number of
stripped-envelope SNe that have mid-IR excess. The observations suggest that
the CSM shell around SN 2014C is originated from an LBV-like eruption roughly
100 years before the explosion. We also report detections of SN1974E, 1979C,
1980K, 1986J, and 1993J detected more than 20 years post-explosion. The number
of outlying SNe identified in this work demonstrates the power of late time
mid-IR observations of a large sample of SNe to identify events with unusual
evolution.

spectra, if not exactly, then by a very good approximation. Here, we argue
differently. It was discovered that spherical partial waves of in-going and
out-going matter can be described by unitary evolution operators independently,
which allows for studies of space-time properties that were not possible
before. Unitarity dictates space-time, as seen by a distant observer, to be
topologically non-trivial. Consequently, Hawking particles are only locally
thermal, but globally not: we explain why Hawking particles emerging from one
hemisphere of a black hole must be 100 % entangled with the Hawking particles
emerging from the other hemisphere. This produces exclusively pure quantum
states evolving in a unitary manner, and removes the interior region for the
outside observer, while it still completely agrees locally with the laws of
general relativity. Unitarity is a starting point; no other assumptions are
made. Region I and the diametrically opposite region II of the Penrose diagram
represent antipodal points in a PT or CPT relation, as was suggested before. On
the horizon itself, antipodal points are identified. A candidate instanton is
proposed to describe the formation and evaporation of virtual black holes of
the type described here. Some important explanations and discussion points are

fine-grained measurements have led to the surprising discovery that many
biological systems sit near a critical point. These systems are potentially
more adaptive in that small changes to component behavior can induce
large-scale changes in aggregate structure and function. Accounting for
criticality remains a challenge as sensitivity to perturbation suggests a lack
of robustness. Furthermore, change induced by perturbation may not be adaptive.
Complicating matters further critical phenomena can result from
history-dependent stochastic processes. A question central to distinguishing
among these conflicting views of criticality is to what degree criticality can
be controlled by the components of the system. We address the control of
criticality using data on conflict dynamics and fight sizes from an animal
society model system (Macaca nemestrina, n=48). The system is fundamentally
finite so we operationalize criticality in information theoretic terms using
Fisher information and a measure of instability. We analyze criticality using
empirically-grounded equilibrium (maximum entropy) and dynamic (branching
process) models of the monkeys' fight-joining behavior. We find that (1) this
heterogeneous, socially organized system, like homogeneous, spatial systems
(flocks and schools), sits near a critical point, (2) the contributions
individuals make to how critical the system is can be quantified and vary, and

core-collapse supernovae. Several lines of evidence suggest that globular
clusters are rich in planets. If so, and if advanced civilizations can develop
there, then the distances between these civilizations and other stars would be
far smaller than typical distances between stars in the Galactic disk. The
relative proximity would facilitate interstellar communication and travel.
However, the very proximity that promotes interstellar travel also brings
danger, since stellar interactions can destroy planetary systems. However, by
modeling globular clusters and their stellar populations, we find that large
regions of many globular clusters can be thought of as ""sweet spots"" where
habitable-zone planetary orbits can be stable for long times. We also compute
the ambient densities and fluxes in the regions within which habitable-zone
planets can survive. Globular clusters are among the best targets for searches
for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). We use the Drake equation to compare
globular clusters to the Galactic disk, in terms of the likelihood of housing
advanced communicating civilizations. We also consider free-floating planets,
since wide-orbit planets can be ejected and travel freely through the cluster.
A civilization spawned in a globular cluster may have opportunities to
establish self-sustaining outposts, thereby reducing the probability that a
single catastrophic event will destroy the civilization or its descendants.
Although individual civilizations within a cluster may follow different
evolutionary paths, or even be destroyed, the cluster may always host some
advanced civilization, once a small number of them have managed to jump across
interstellar space.

The most primitive metal-poor stars are important for studying the

is based on the mismatch between spectral types derived from colors and
observed spectral types. They were observed first at low resolution with EFOSC2
at the NTT/ESO to obtain an initial set of stellar parameters. The most
promising candidate, 2MASS J18082002-5104378 (V=11.9), was observed at high
resolution (R=50 000) with UVES at the VLT/ESO, and a standard abundance
analysis was performed. Results. We found that 2MASS J18082002-5104378 is an
ultra metal-poor star with stellar parameters Teff = 5440 K, log g = 3.0 dex,
vt = 1.5 km/s, [Fe/H] = -4.1 dex. The star has [C/Fe]<+0.9 in a 1D analysis, or
[C/Fe]<=+0.5 if 3D effects are considered; its abundance pattern is typical of
normal (non-CEMP) ultra metal-poor stars. Interestingly, the star has a binary

star of its category, and it could be studied further with even higher S/N
spectroscopy to determine additional chemical abundances, thus providing
important constraints to the early chemical evolution of our Galaxy.

eavesdropper) while guaranteeing the secure communication for the multi-
antenna information receiver (IR). Two types of IR, with and without the
capability to cancel the interference from energy signals, are taken into
account. In the scenario of single energy receiver (ER), we consider the joint
design of the transmis- sion information and energy covariances for EHM. Both

understanding the prevalence of obscuring clouds and hazes in their
atmospheres. The ability to predict the presence of clouds/hazes a priori is an
important goal when faced with limited telescope resources and advancements in
atmospheric characterization that rely on the detection of spectroscopic
features. As a means to identify favorable targets for future studies with HST
and JWST, we use published HST/WFC3 transmission spectra to determine the
strength of each planet's water feature, as defined by the H2O - J index. By
expressing this parameter in units of atmospheric scale height, we provide a
means to efficiently compare the size of spectral features over a physically
diverse sample of exoplanets. We find the H2O - J index to be strongly
correlated with planet temperature when $T_{eq} < 750^{+90}_{-60}$ K and weakly
correlated with surface gravity for planets with $\log g < 3.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$
dex. Otherwise, the median value of the H2O - J index is $1.8{\pm}0.3$ H. Using
these two physical parameters, we identify a division between ""classes"" of
exoplanets, such that objects above $T_{eq} = 700$ K and $\log g = 2.8$ dex are
more likely to have clearer atmospheres with stronger spectral features (H2O -
J > 1) and those below at least one of these thresholds are increasingly likely
to have predominantly cloudy atmospheres with muted spectral features (H2O - J
< 1). Additional high-precision measurements are needed to corroborate the
reported trends.

an equivalent many body Green's function approach can be formulated.

2D DNA lattice made up of short, single-stranded tile (SST) motifs was created.
Previously, the growth of SST DNA assemblies was restricted to 1D (tubes and
ribbons) or finite-sized 2D (molecular canvases). By utilizing the
substrate-assisted growth method, sets of SSTs were designed as unit cells to
self-assemble into periodic and aperiodic 2D lattices which continuously grow
both along and orthogonal to the helical axis. Notably, large-scale ($\sim 1$
$\mu$m$^2$) fully periodic 2D lattices were fabricated using a minimum of just
2 strand species. Furthermore, the ability to create 2D lattices from a few
motifs enables certain rules to be encoded into these SSTs to carry out
algorithmic self-assembly. A set of these motifs were designed to execute
simple 1-input 1-output COPY and NOT algorithms, the space-time manifestations
which were aperiodic 2D algorithmic SST lattices. The methodology presented
here can be straightforwardly applied to other motifs which fall into this type
of kinetic trap to create novel DNA crystals.

anisotropy (PMA) of thin Palladium-Cobalt bi-layer films can be modified when
hydrogen gas is absorbed by the Palladium (Pd) layer. In our recent work we
showed that the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) response of this material is
sensitive to changes in PMA upon exposure of Pd to hydrogen gas. As such, a
simple, compact and contactless hydrogen gas sensor could exploit FMR-based
detection, of the reversible hydrogen-gas-induced changes in PMA. The magnitude
of the FMR peak shift is critical in determining the sensor's sensitivity: the
higher the FMR peak shift at a given hydrogen gas concentration, the higher the
sensitivity. In the present work we demonstrate that the detection sensitivity
is enhanced when the static magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the film
plane. A factor of eight times improvement is observed with respect to the
in-plane FMR configuration studied previously. An analysis based on the Kittel
equation for FMR frequencies of a ferromagnetic film is carried out in order to
understand the mechanism of sensitivity enhancement. The result is important
for optimizing Pd/Co bi-layered thin films for use in novel platforms for

investigation of causal mechanisms. Over the past several decades, causal
mediation analysis has been used in medical and social sciences to decompose
the treatment effect into the natural direct and indirect effects. However, all
of the existing mediation analysis methods rely on parametric modeling
assumptions in one way or another, typically requiring researchers to specify
multiple regression models involving the treatment, mediator, outcome, and
pre-treatment confounders. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel
nonparametric estimation method for causal mediation analysis that eliminates
the need for applied researchers to model multiple conditional distributions.
The proposed method balances a certain set of empirical moments between the
treatment and control groups by weighting each observation; in particular, we
establish that the proposed estimator is globally semiparametric efficient. We
also show how to consistently estimate the asymptotic variance of the proposed
estimator without additional efforts. Finally, we extend the proposed method to
other relevant settings including the causal mediation analysis with multiple

whereby user associations, ON-OFF states of SBSs, and power control are jointly
optimized according to the statistical information of energy arrival and
traffic load. Specifically, for the single SBS case, the power saving gain
achieved by activating the SBS is derived in closed form, based on which the
SBS activation condition and optimal traffic offloading amount are obtained.
Furthermore, a two-stage energy-aware traffic offloading (TEATO) scheme is
proposed for the multiple-SBS case, considering various operating
characteristics of SBSs with different power sources. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve more than 50% power saving
gain for typical daily traffic and solar energy profiles, compared with the
conventional traffic offloading schemes.

subdwarf stars were measured by fitting the profiles of hydrogen (H) and helium
(He) lines with synthetic spectra from non-LTE model atmospheres. Most of the
sdB stars scatter near the Extreme Horizontal Branch in the $T_{\rm
eff}-\log{g}$ diagram and two well defined groups can be outlined. A clustering
of He-enriched sdO stars appears near $T_{\rm eff}=45\,000$ K and $\log(g) =
5.8$. The sdB population separates into several nearly parallel sequences in
the $T_{\rm eff}-{\rm He}$ abundance diagram with clumps corresponding to those
in the $T_{\rm eff}-\log{g}$ diagram. Over $38\,000$ K (sdO) stars show
abundance extremes, they are either He-rich or He-deficient and we observe only
a few stars in the $ -1 < \log(y) < 0$ abundance range. With increasing
temperature these extremes become less prominent and the He abundance
approaches to $\log(y)\sim-0.5$. A unique property of our sample is that it
covers a large range in apparent magnitudes and galactic latitudes, therefore
it contains a mix of stars from different populations and galactic
environments. Our results are consistent with the findings of Hirsch (2009) and
we conclude that He-rich and He-deficient sdB stars ($\log(y) < 1$) probably
origin from different populations. We also find that most sdO and sdB stars lie
in a narrow strip in the luminosity and helium abundance plane, which suggests
that these atmospheric parameters are correlated.

networks, in which nodes are associated with dynamic state variables, whose

have been the prevailing paradigm to model such a network-based dynamics, for
instance in the form of random walks or other types of diffusions. Despite the
success of this modelling perspective for numerous applications, it represents
an over-simplification of several real-world systems. Importantly, simple
Markov models lack memory in their dynamics, an assumption often not realistic

means of second-order Markov models, exploiting empirical pathway information.
We focus on the problem of community detection and show that standard network

such images, a time-series is obtained at each of a large number of
spatially-dependent data units. It is interesting to organize these data into
model-based clusters. A two-stage procedure is proposed. In Stage 1, a mixture
of autoregressions (MoAR) model is used to marginally cluster the data. The
MoAR model is fitted using maximum marginal likelihood (MMaL) estimation via an
MM (minorization--maximization) algorithm. In Stage 2, a Markov random field
(MRF) model induces a spatial structure onto the Stage 1 clustering. The MRF
model is fitted using maximum pseudolikelihood (MPL) estimation via an MM
algorithm. Both the MMaL and MPL estimators are proved to be consistent.
Numerical properties are established for both MM algorithms. A simulation study
demonstrates the performance of the two-stage procedure. An application to the
segmentation of a zebrafish brain calcium image is presented.

sub-populations via finite mixtures composed of Dirichlet processes, which are
related to each other through a hierarchical matrix normal structure
responsible for inducing gene-gene interactions and possible mutations in
association with environmental variables. We also extend the Bayesian
hypotheses testing procedures of Bhattacharya & Bhattacharya (2015) to detect
the roles of genes and their interactions, environment and the influence of
environment on gene-gene interactions, in case-control studies. We develop an
effective parallel computing methodology, which harnesses the power of parallel

Gibbs sampling and Transformation based MCMC (TMCMC) methods.Applications of
our model and methods to simulation studies with biologically realistic
case-control genotype datasets obtained under five distinct set-ups yield
encouraging results in each case. We followed these up by application of our

  Bispanning Graphs","With minor corrections to v2",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bispanning graphs are undirected graphs with an edge set that can be
decomposed into two disjoint spanning trees. The operation of symmetrically
swapping two edges between the trees, such that the result is a different pair
of disjoint spanning trees, is called an edge exchange or a symmetric base
exchange. The graph of symmetric base exchanges of a bispanning graph contains
a vertex for every valid pair of disjoint spanning trees, and edges between
them to represent all possible edge exchanges. We are interested in a
restriction of these graphs to only unique symmetric base exchanges, which are
edge exchanges wherein selecting one edge leaves only one choice for selecting
the other. In this thesis, we discuss the structure of the graph of unique
symmetric edge exchanges, and the open question whether these are connected for
all bispanning graphs. Our composition method classifies bispanning graphs by
whether they contain a non-trivial bispanning subgraph, and by vertex- and
edge-connectivity. For bispanning graphs containing a non-trivial bispanning
subgraph, we prove that the unique exchange graph is the Cartesian graph
product of two smaller exchange graphs. For bispanning graphs with
vertex-connectivity two, we show that the bispanning graph is the 2-clique sum
of two smaller bispanning graphs, and that the unique exchange graph can be
built by joining their exchange graphs and forwarding edges at the join seam.
And for all remaining bispanning graphs, we prove a composition method at a
vertex of degree three, wherein the unique exchange graph is constructed from
the exchange graphs of three reduced bispanning graphs.

Nakagami-based texture analysis to accommodate subtle speckle spatial frequency
tissue intensity variability in volumetric scans. Local textural fractal
descriptors - which are invariant to affine intensity changes - are extracted
from volumetric patches at different spatial resolutions from voxel
lattice-based generated shape and scale Nakagami parameters. Using ultrasound

tissue characterization results were superior to the state of art. Experimental
results on real 3D ultrasonic pre-clinical and clinical datasets suggest that

e-Government strategy. The eID system ensures unique identification and secure
authentication for citizens protecting access to applications where sensitive
and personal data is involved. In particular, the Austrian eID system supports
three main use cases: Identification and authentication of Austrian citizens,
electronic representation, and foreign citizen authentication at Austrian
public sector applications. For supporting all these use cases, several
components -- either locally deployed in the applications' domain or centrally
deployed -- need to communicate with each other. While local deployments have
some advantages in terms of scalability, still a central deployment of all
involved components would be advantageous, e.g. due to less maintenance
efforts. However, a central deployment can easily lead to load bottlenecks
because theoretically the whole Austrian population as well as -- for foreign
citizens -- the whole EU population could use the provided services. To
mitigate the issue on scalability, in this paper we propose the migration of
main components of the ecosystem into a public cloud. However, a move of
trusted services into a public cloud brings up new obstacles, particular with
respect to privacy. To bypass the issue on privacy, in this paper we propose an
approach on how the complete Austrian eID ecosystem can be moved into a public
cloud in a privacy-preserving manner by applying selected cryptographic
technologies (in particular using proxy re-encryption and redactable
signatures). Applying this approach, no sensitive data will be disclosed to a
public cloud provider by still supporting all three main eID system use cases.
We finally discuss our approach based on selected criteria.

changes of the mean and amplitude of the light curves are used to search for
activity cycles. The rotation period changes give an estimate of the rate of
surface differential rotation. The Kuiper method is applied to the epochs of
the primary and secondary minima to search for active longitudes. The
photometry reveals the presence of a stable mean light curve (MLC) connected to
the orbital period P_orb = 20d.6252 of this binary. We remove this MLC from the
original V magnitudes which gives us the corrected V' magnitudes. These two
samples of V and V' data are analysed separately with CPS. The fraction of
unreliable CPS models decreases when the MLC is removed. The same significant
activity cycle of approximately 12.5 years is detected in both V and V'
samples. The estimate for the surface differential rotation coefficient, k >=
0.10, is the same for both samples, but the number of unrealistic period
estimates decreases after removing the MLC. The same active longitude period of
P_al = 20d.511 +- 0d.005 is detected in the V and V' magnitudes. This long-term
regularity in the epochs of primary and secondary minima of the light curves is
not caused by the MLC. On the contrary, the MLC hampers the detection of active
longitudes.

luminosity. They are characterized by strong photo-metric and spectroscopic
variability related to transient eruptions. The mechanisms at the origin of
these eruptions is not well known. In addition, their formation is still
problematic and the presence of a companion could help to explain how they
form. Aims. This article presents a study of seven LBVs (about 20% of the known
Galactic population), some Wolf-Rayet stars, and massive binaries. We probe the
environments that surround these massive stars with near-, mid-, and
far-infrared images, investigating potential nebula/shells and the companion
stars. Methods. To investigate large spatial scales, we used seeing-limited and
near diffraction-limited adaptive optics images to obtain a differential
diagnostic on the presence of circumstellar matter and to determine their
extent. From those images, we also looked for the presence of binary companions
on a wide orbit. Once a companion was detected, its gravitational binding to
the central star was tested. Tests include the chance projection probability,
the proper motion estimates with multi-epoch observations, flux ratio, and star
separations. Results. We find that two out of seven of LBVs may have a wide
orbit companion. Most of the LBVs display a large circumstellar envelope or
several shells. In particular, HD168625, known for its rings, possesses several
shells with possibly a large cold shell at the edge of which the rings are
formed. For the first time, we have directly imaged the companion of LBV stars.

in models of planar rigid bodies in point contact with a rigid surface, subject
to Coulomb-like dry friction. The phenomenon occurs due to coupling between
normal and rotational degrees-of-freedom such that the effective normal force
becomes attractive rather than repulsive. Despite a rich literature, the
forward evolution problem remains unsolved other than in certain restricted
cases in 2D with single contact points. Various practical consequences of the
theory are revisited, including models for robotic manipulators, and the
strange behaviour of chalk when pushed rather than dragged across a blackboard.
  Reviewing recent theory, a general formulation is proposed, including a
Poisson or energetic impact law. The general problem in 2D with a single point
of contact is discussed and cases or inconsistency or indeterminacy enumerated.
Strategies to resolve the paradox via contact regularisation are discussed from
a dynamical systems point of view. By passing to the infinite stiffness limit
and allowing impact without collision, inconsistent and indeterminate cases are
shown to be resolvable for all open sets of conditions. However, two
unavoidable ambiguities that can be reached in finite time are discussed in
detail, so called dynamic jam and reverse chatter. A partial review is given of
2D cases with two points of contact showing how a greater complexity of
inconsistency and indeterminacy can arise. Extension to fully three-dimensional
analysis is briefly considered and shown to lead to further possible
singularities. In conclusion, the ubiquity of the \pain paradox is highlighted
and open problems are discussed.

periodicity in the spectroscopic variations. However, the periodicity of
4000-4500 days covers only one cycle of variation and should be confirmed with
a longer monitoring campaign. There is an indication of the period around 1300
days in the spectroscopic light curves, but with small significance level,
while the 1850 days period could not be clearly identified in the spectroscopic
light curves. The line profiles have not significantly changed, showing an
important red asymmetry and broad line peak redshifted around +1000 km
s$^{-1}$. However, H$\beta$ shows broader mean profile and has a larger
time-lag ($\tau\sim120$ days) than H$\gamma$ ($\tau\sim60$ days). We estimate
that the mass of the black hole is $\sim2.6\times10^9\rm M_\odot$. The obtained

gyrokinetic theory, we study the effect of different up-down asymmetric flux
surface shapes on the turbulent transport of momentum. This is done by
perturbatively expanding the gyrokinetic equation in large flux surface shaping
mode number. It is found that the momentum flux generated by shaping that lacks
mirror symmetry (which is necessarily up-down asymmetric) has a power law
scaling with the shaping mode number. However, the momentum flux generated by
mirror symmetric flux surface shaping (even if it is up-down asymmetric) decays
exponentially with large shaping mode number. These scalings are consistent
with nonlinear local gyrokinetic simulations and indicate that low mode number
shaping effects (e.g. elongation, triangularity) are optimal for creating
rotation. Additionally it suggests that breaking the mirror symmetry of flux

one-dimensional ran- dom walk in which the flight probability to one of the two
directions (i.e., bias) oscillates dynam- ically in periodic, quasiperiodic,
and chaotic manners. The probability oscillation dynamics can be physically
observed in nanoscale photoexcitation transfer in a quantum-dot network, where
the existence probability of an exciton at the bottom energy level of a quantum
dot fluctuates dif- ferently with a parameter setting. We evaluate the ensemble
average of the time-averaged mean square displacement (ETMSD) of the time
series obtained from the quantum-dot network model that generates various
oscillatory behaviors because the ETMSD exhibits characteristic changes
depending on the fluctuating bias; in the case of normal diffusion, the
asymptotic behavior of the ETMSD is proportional to the time (i.e., a linear
growth function), whereas it grows nonlinearly with an exponent greater than 1
in the case of superdiffusion. We find that the diffusion can be accelerated
significantly when the fluctuating bias is characterized as weak chaos owing to
the transient nonstationarity of its biases, in which the spectrum contains
high power at low frequen- cies. By introducing a simplified model of our
random walk, which exhibits superdiffusion as well as normal diffusion, we
explain the mechanism of the accelerated diffusion by analyzing the mean square
displacement.

reproducing bulk nuclear properties like binding energies, radii, or quadrupole
moments throughout the entire periodic table. Its extension to the
multi-reference level allows for restoring symmetries and, in turn, for
calculating transition rates.
  [Purpose] We propose a new no-core-configuration-interaction (NCCI) model
treating properly isospin and rotational symmetries. The model is applicable to
any nucleus irrespective of its mass and neutron- and proton-number parity. It
properly includes polarization effects caused by an interplay between the long-
and short-range forces acting in the atomic nucleus.
  [Methods] The method is based on solving the Hill-Wheeler-Griffin equation
within a model space built of linearly-dependent states having good angular
momentum and properly treated isobaric spin. The states are generated by means
of the isospin and angular-momentum projection applied to a set of low-lying
(multi)particle-(multi)hole deformed Slater determinants calculated using the
self-consistent Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach.
  [Results] The theory is applied to calculate energy spectra in N~Z nuclei
that are relevant from the point of view of a study of superallowed Fermi
beta-decays. In particular, a new set of the isospin-symmetry-breaking
corrections to these decays is given.
  [Conclusions] It is demonstrated that the NCCI model is capable to capture
main features of low-lying energy spectra in light and medium-mass nuclei using
relatively small model space and without any local readjustment of its
low-energy coupling constants. Its flexibility and a range of applicability
makes it an interesting alternative to the conventional nuclear shell model.

the field of robust optimization has gained a lot of attention over the past
decade. We concentrate on maximum flow problems and introduce a novel robust
optimization model which, compared to known models from the literature,
features several advantageous properties: (i) We consider a general class of
path-based flow problems which can be used to model a large variety of network
routing problems (and other packing problems). (ii) We aim at solutions that
are robust against targeted attacks by a potent adversary who may attack any
flow path of his choice on any edge of the network. (iii) In contrast to
previous robust maximum flow models, for which no efficient algorithms are
known, optimal robust flows for the most important basic variants of our model
can be found in polynomial time.
  We also consider generalizations where the flow player can spend a budget to
protect the network against the interdictor. Here, we show that the problem can
be solved efficiently when the interdiction costs are determined by the flow
player from scratch. However, the problem becomes hard to approximate when the
flow player has to improve an initial protection infrastructure.

thus not widely applied. Here, we present a study of the reproducibility of PFM
signals and of the so-called PFM background signal which has been reported in
literature. We find that PFM signals are generally reproducible to certain
extents. The PFM signal difference between 180{\deg} domains on
periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN) is taken as the reference signal in a
large number of measurements, carried out in a low frequency regime (30-70
kHz). We show that in comparison to Pt coated tips, diamond coated tips exhibit
improved signal stability, lower background signal and less imaging artifacts
related to PFM which is reflected in the spread of measurements. This is
attributed to the improved mechanical stability of the conductive layer. The
average deviation of the mean PFM signal is 38.3%, for a diamond coated tip.
Although this deviation is relatively high, it is far better than values from
literature which showed a deviation of approx. 73.1%. Additionally, we find
that the average deviation of the background signal from 0 is 11.6% of the PPLN
domain contrast. Thus, the background signal needs to be taken into account
when quantifying PFM signals and should be subtracted from PFM signals. Those
results are important for quantification of PFM signals, since PPLN might be
used for this purpose when PFM signals measured on PPLN are related to its
macroscopic d33 coefficient. Finally, the crucial influence of sample polishing
on PFM signals is shown and we recommend to use a multistep polishing route
with a final step involving 200 nm sized colloidal silica particles.

The proof is based on the fact that the model is asymptotically equivalent to

semiconductors, tiny spatial variations in spin dynamics relieve spin blocking
at transport bottlenecks or in the electron-hole recombination process that
produces light. Large room-temperature magnetic-field effects (MFE) ensue in
the conductivity and luminescence. Sources of variable spin dynamics generate
much larger MFE if their spatial structure is correlated on the nanoscale with
the energetic sites governing conductivity or luminescence such as in
co-evaporated organic blends within which the electron resides on one molecule
and the hole on the other (an exciplex). Here we show that exciplex
recombination in blends exhibiting thermally-activated delayed fluorescence
(TADF) produces MFE in excess of 60% at room temperature. In addition, effects
greater than 4000% can be achieved by tuning the device's current-voltage
response curve by device conditioning. These immense MFEs are both the largest
reported values for their device type at room temperature. Our theory traces
this MFE and its unusual temperature dependence to changes in spin mixing
between triplet exciplexes and light-emitting singlet exciplexes. In contrast,
spin mixing of excitons is energetically suppressed, and thus spin mixing
produces comparatively weaker MFE in materials emitting light from excitons by
affecting the precursor pairs. Demonstration of immense MFE in common organic
blends provides a flexible and inexpensive pathway towards magnetic
functionality and field sensitivity in current organic devices without
patterning the constituent materials on the nanoscale. Magnetic fields increase

the diffusion behaviour of a biomolecule (or even of a larger object) is
affected by other moving macromolecules, organelles, and so on, inside a living
cell, whence the possibility of understanding whether or not a randomly walking
biomolecule is also subject to a long-range force field driving it to its
target. Method: By means of the Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) technique
the topic of random walk in random environment is here considered in the case
of a passively diffusing particle in a crowded environment made of randomly
moving and interacting obstacles. Results: The relevant physical quantity which
is worked out is the diffusion cofficient of the passive tracer which is
computed as a function of the average inter-obstacles distance. Coclusions: The
results reported here suggest that if a biomolecule, let us call it a test
molecule, moves towards its target in the presence of other independently
interacting molecules, its motion can be considerably slowed down. Hence, if
such a slowing down could compromise the efficiency of the task to be performed
by the test molecule, some accelerating factor would be required.
Intermolecular electrodynamic forces are good candidates as accelerating
factors because they can act at a long distance in a medium like the cytosol
despite its ionic strength.

number of soft gluons which propagate at large angles with respect to the jet
axis and which collectively carry a substantial amount of energy. By explicitly
computing 2-gluon correlations, we demonstrate the existence of large
event-by-event fluctuations, which reflect the stochastic nature of the

energy loss at large angles and the soft gluon multiplicity --, the dispersion
is parametrically as large as the respective expectation value. We identify
interesting scaling laws, which suggest that the multiplicity distribution
should exhibit KNO (Koba-Nielsen-Olesen) scaling. A similar scaling is known to
hold for a jet branching in the vacuum, but the medium-induced distribution is
found to be considerably broader. We predict that event-by-event measurements
of the di-jet asymmetry in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC should observe large
fluctuations in the number of soft hadrons propagating at large angles and also
in the total energy carried by these hadrons.

planets is ultimately controlled by the thermal structure of the lower rocky
mantle. Using the most common model to tackle this problem, a rapidly rotating
and differentially cooled spherical shell containing an incompressible and
viscous liquid is numerically investigated. To gain the physical basics, we
consider a simple, equatorial symmetric perturbation of the CMB heat flux
shaped as a spherical harmonic $Y_{11}$. The thermodynamic properties of the
induced flows mainly depend on the degree of nonlinearity parametrised by a
horizontal Rayleigh number $Ra_h=q^\ast Ra$, where $q^\ast$ is the relative CMB
heat flux anomaly amplitude and $Ra$ is the Rayleigh number which controls
radial buoyancy-driven convection. Depending on $Ra_h$ we characterise three
flow regimes through their spatial patterns, heat transport and flow speed
scalings: in the linear conductive regime the radial inward flow is found to be
phase shifted $90^\circ$ eastwards from the maximal heat flux as predicted by a
linear quasi-geostrophic model for rapidly rotating spherical systems. The
advective regime is characterised by an increased $Ra_h$ where nonlinearities
become significant, but is still subcritical to radial convection. There the
upwelling is dispersed and the downwelling is compressed by the thermal
advection into a spiralling jet-like structure. As $Ra_h$ becomes large enough
for the radial convection to set in, the jet remains identifiable on
time-average and significantly alters the global heat budget in the convective
regime. Our results suggest, that the boundary forcing not only introduces a
net horizontal heat transport but also suppresses the convection locally to
such an extent, that the net Nusselt number is reduced by up to 50\%, even
though the mean CMB heat flux is conserved.

oligopoly through an extended two-stage game. The competing Cournot firms
produce low-cost but limited quantities of a single homogeneous product. For
additional procurements, they may refer to a revenue-maximizing supplier who
sets a wholesale price prior to their orders. We express this chain as a
two-stage game and study its equilibrium under two different information
levels: complete and incomplete information on the side of the supplier about
the actual market demand. In the deterministic case, we derive the unique
subgame perfect Nash equilibrium for different values of the retailers'
capacity levels, supplier's cost and market demand. To study the incomplete
information case, we model demand uncertainty via a continuous probability
distribution. Under mild assumptions, we characterize the supplier's optimal
pricing policy as a fixed point of a proper translation of his expectation
about the orders that he will receive from the retailers. If this expectation
is decreasing in his price, then such an optimal policy always exists and is
unique. Based on this characterization, we are able to proceed with comparative
statics and sensitivity analysis, both analytically and numerically. Incomplete
information gives rise to market inefficiencies because the supplier may ask
for a too high price. Increasing supplier's cost results in increasing
wholesale prices, decreasing orders from the retailers and hence decreasing
consumer surplus. Increasing retailers' production capacities results in
decreasing wholesale prices and increasing consumer surplus. Finally, as the
number of second-stage retailers increases, the supplier's profit may initially
rise but eventually drops.

  Circuit Theory and Applications",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A common approach to model memristive systems is to include empirical window
functions to describe edge effects and non-linearities in the change of the
memristance. We demonstrate that under quite general conditions, each window
function can be associated with a sigmoidal curve relating the normalised
time-dependent memristance to the time integral of the input. Conversely, this
explicit relation allows us to derive window functions suitable for the
mesoscopic modelling of memristive systems from a variety of well-known
sigmoidals. Such sigmoidal curves are defined in terms of measured variables
and can thus be extracted from input and output signals of a device and then
transformed to its corresponding window. We also introduce a new generalised
window function that allows the flexible modelling of asymmetric edge effects
in a simple manner.

Burgess et al. (J Neuropath and Exp Neur 56: 704-713, 1997) as an starting
point, we present a model for tumour growth under medical treatment represented
by a non-linear partial differential equation that is solved using the Adomian
Decomposition Method (ADM). It is also shown that the non-linear term
efficiently models the effects of the combined therapies. By means of a proper
use of parameters, this model could be used for calculating doses in
radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
