proving these theorems are even more far reaching. The general idea is to
describe some family of events, whose cardinality a priori could be large, only
with a few certificates. Here, we show some applications of the methods,
including counting $C_4$-free graphs, considering the size of a maximum

unfitted discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (UDG-FEM) for solving the
electroencephalography (EEG) forward problem. Methods: This new approach for
source analysis does not use a geometry conforming volume triangulation, but
instead uses a structured mesh that does not resolve the geometry. The geometry
is described using level set functions and is incorporated implicitly in its
mathematical formulation. As no triangulation is necessary, the complexity of a
simulation pipeline and the need for manual interaction for patient specific
simulations can be reduced and is comparable with that of the FEM for
hexahedral meshes. In addition, it maintains conservation laws on a discrete
level. Here, we present the theory for UDG-FEM forward modeling, its
verification using quasi-analytical solutions in multi-layer sphere models and
an evaluation in a comparison with a discontinuous Galerkin (DG-FEM) method on
hexahedral and on conforming tetrahedral meshes. We furthermore apply the
UDG-FEM forward approach in a realistic head model simulation study. Results:
The given results show convergence and indicate a good overall accuracy of the
UDG-FEM approach. UDG-FEM performs comparable or even better than DG-FEM on a
conforming tetrahedral mesh while providing a less complex simulation pipeline.
When compared to DG-FEM on hexahedral meshes, an overall better accuracy is
achieved. Conclusion: The UDG-FEM approach is an accurate, flexible and
promising method to solve the EEG forward problem. Significance: This study
shows the first application of the UDG-FEM approach to the EEG forward problem.

such an induced matter for some values of the equation of state parameter and
analyze in detail their corresponding solutions. To illustrate the cosmological
behaviors of the solutions, we contrast our solutions with those present the

impossible to find a physically acceptable solution associated to the negative

However, for a spatially flat and closed universes, we argue that our obtained
solutions are more general than those associated to the standard BD theory and,
moreover, they contain a few classes of solutions which have no analog in the
BD cosmology. For those particular cases, we further compare the results with

device carrying out measurements consecutively. We provide a novel construction
of attacks that is strictly more powerful than the best known attacks and has
the potential to decide the question whether such practical CKD schemes are
possible in the negative.

Kaplansky and Riordan in 1946. Goldman, Joichi and White in 1975 showed that
the sum over $k$ of the product of the $(n-k)$-th rook numbers multiplied by
the $k$-th falling factorial polynomials factorize into a product. In the
sequel, different types of generalizations and analogues of this product
formula have been derived by various authors. In 2008, Miceli and Remmel
constructed a rook theory model involving augmented rook boards in which they
showed the validity of a general product formula which can be specialized to
all other product formulas that so far have appeared in the literature on rook
theory. In this work, we construct an elliptic extension of the $q$-analogue of
Miceli and Remmel's result. Special cases yield elliptic extensions of various
known rook theory models.

are how the upper chromosphere is heated and what drives spicules. Estimates of
the required chromospheric heating, based on radiative and conductive losses
suggest a rate of ${\sim} 0.1 \mathrm{\:erg\:cm^{-3}\:s^{-1}}$ in the lower
chromosphere dropping to ${\sim} 10^{-3} \mathrm{\:erg\:cm^{-3}\:s^{-1}}$ in
the upper chromosphere (\citet{Avrett1981}). The chromosphere is also permeated
by spicules, higher density plasma from the lower atmosphere propelled upwards
at speeds of ${\sim} 10-20 \mathrm{\:km\:s^{-1}}$, for so called Type-I
spicules (\citet{Pereira2012,Zhang2012}), reaching heights of ${\sim} 3000-5000
\mathrm{\:km}$ above the photosphere. A clearer understanding of chromospheric
dynamics, its heating and the formation of spicules, is thus of central
importance to solar atmospheric science. For over thirty years it has been
proposed that photospheric driving of MHD waves may be responsible for both
heating and spicule formation. This paper presents results from a
high-resolution MHD treatment of photospheric driven Alfv\'en and kink waves
propagating upwards into an expanding flux tube embedded in a model
chromospheric atmosphere. We show that the ponderomotive coupling from Alfv\'en
and kink waves into slow modes generates shocks which both heat the upper
chromosphere and drive spicules. These simulations show that wave driving of
the solar chromosphere can give a local heating rate which matches observations
and drive spicules consistent with Type-I observations all within a single
coherent model.

cancer can strike at any age; it is one of the leading causes of loss of life
in young persons. Since this cancer is visible on the skin, it is potentially
detectable at a very early stage when it is curable. New developments have
converged to make fully automatic early melanoma detection a real possibility.
First, the advent of dermoscopy has enabled a dramatic boost in clinical
diagnostic ability to the point that melanoma can be detected in the clinic at
the very earliest stages. The global adoption of this technology has allowed
accumulation of large collections of dermoscopy images of melanomas and benign
lesions validated by histopathology. The development of advanced technologies
in the areas of image processing and machine learning have given us the ability
to allow distinction of malignant melanoma from the many benign mimics that
require no biopsy. These new technologies should allow not only earlier
detection of melanoma, but also reduction of the large number of needless and
costly biopsy procedures. Although some of the new systems reported for these
technologies have shown promise in preliminary trials, widespread
implementation must await further technical progress in accuracy and
reproducibility. In this paper, we provide an overview of computerized
detection of melanoma in dermoscopy images. First, we discuss the various
aspects of lesion segmentation. Then, we provide a brief overview of clinical
feature segmentation. Finally, we discuss the classification stage where
machine learning algorithms are applied to the attributes generated from the
segmented features to predict the existence of melanoma.

whose properties hint at a reverberation origin. Here, we adapt general
relativistic ray tracing impulse response functions used to model X-ray
reverberation in AGN for neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries. Assuming
relativistic reflection forms the broad iron line and associated reflection
continuum, we use reflection fits to the energy spectrum along with the impulse
response functions to calculate the expected lags as a function of energy over
the range of observed kHz QPO frequencies in 4U 1608-52. We find that the lag
energy spectrum is expected to increase with increasing energy above 8 keV,
while the observed lags in 4U 1608-52 show the opposite behavior. This
demonstrates that the lags in the lower kHz QPO of 4U 1608-52 are not solely
due to reverberation. We do note, however, that the models appear to be more
consistent with the much flatter lag energy spectrum observed in the upper kHz
QPO of several neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries, suggesting that lower and

particle suppression for different types of probes exhibit a clear mass
hierarchy, which is a direct consequence of the differences in the energy loss,
rather than the differences in the initial distributions. On the other hand, we
predict that the mass hierarchy is not expected at high momentum (i.e.,
$p_\perp \sim 100$GeV); i.e., while we surprisingly predict that suppression
for charged hadrons will be somewhat smaller than the suppression for heavy
mesons, we find that this difference will be a consequence of fragmentation
functions, not the finite mass effects. That is, apart from the fragmentation
functions, the probes of different masses exhibit nearly the same suppression
in the high momentum region. We also argue that the same insensitivity on the
probe types also appears for jets. In particular, the experimental data in the
momentum regions where they exist for both types of probes, show similar
suppressions of charged hadrons and inclusive jet data. Interestingly, we also
find that our state-of-the-art suppression predictions for high momentum single

reasons behind this agreement yet remain to be understood. Finally, the
available jet data also show (though with large error bars) an overlap between
b jets (heavy) and inclusive jets (light) probes. Consequently, our results
suggest that single particles in the momentum region below 50 GeV present an
excellent tool for mass tomography, while high momentum single particles and
(possibly) jets are somewhat insensitive to the details of the interaction with
quark-gluon plasma.

disk evolution, and can possibly help us to trace the outcomes of planetary
formation processes. In the age range 10 to 100\,Myr, most of the gas is
expected to have been removed from the system, giant planets (if any) must have
already been formed, and the formation of terrestrial planets may be on-going.
Pluto-sized planetesimals, and their debris released in a collisional cascade,
are under their mutual gravitational influence, which may result into
non-axisymmetric structures in the debris disk. High angular resolution
observations are required to investigate these effects and constrain the
dynamical evolution of debris disks. Furthermore, multi-wavelength observations
can provide information about the dust dynamics by probing different grain
sizes. Here we present new VLT/SPHERE and ALMA observations of the debris disk
around the 40\,Myr-old solar-type star HD\,61005. We resolve the disk at
unprecedented resolution both in the near-infrared (in scattered and polarized
light) and at millimeter wavelengths. Thanks to the new observations, we
propose a solution for both the radial and azimuthal distribution of the dust
grains in the debris disk. We find that the disk has a moderate eccentricity
($e \sim 0.1$) and that the dust density is two times larger at the pericenter
compared to the apocenter. With no giant planets detected in our observations,
we investigate alternative explanations besides planet-disk interactions to
interpret the inferred disk morphology. We postulate that the morphology of the
disk could be the consequence of a massive collision between
$\sim$\,1000\,km-sized bodies at $\sim$\,61\,au. If this interpretation holds,
it would put stringent constraints on the formation of massive planetesimals at
large distances from the star.

type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2010ev. Methods. We obtain and analyze multi-band
optical light curves and optical-near-infrared spectroscopy at low and medium
resolution spanning from -7 days to +300 days from the B-band maximum. Results.
A photometric analysis shows that SN 2010ev is a SN Ia of normal brightness
with a light curve shape of $\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.12 \pm 0.02$ and a stretch s =
$0.94 \pm 0.01$ suffering significant reddening. From photometric and
spectroscopic analysis, we deduce a color excess of $E(B - V) = 0.25 \pm 0.05$
and a reddening law of $R_v = 1.54 \pm 0.65$. Spectroscopically, SN 2010ev
belongs to the broad-line SN Ia group, showing stronger than average Si II
{\lambda}6355 absorption features. We also find that SN 2010ev is a
high-velocity gradient SN, with a value of $164 \pm 7$ km s$^{-1}$ d$^{-1}$.
The photometric and spectral comparison with other supernovae shows that SN
2010ev has similar colors and velocities to SN 2002bo and SN 2002dj. The
analysis of the nebular spectra indicates that the [Fe II] {\lambda}7155 and
[Ni II] {\lambda}7378 lines are redshifted, as expected for a high velocity
gradient supernova. All these common intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the
high velocity gradient (HVG) group are different from the low velocity gradient
(LVG) normal SN Ia population and suggest significant variety in SN Ia
explosions.

consumption and quality of service (QoS). Minimizing grid energy consumption by
utilizing the harvested energy will make the network environmentally friendly,
but the achievable QoS may be degraded due to the intermittent nature of energy
harvesting. To investigate the tradeoff between these two aspects, we introduce
the total service cost as the performance metric, which is the weighted sum of
the grid energy cost and the QoS degradation cost. Base station assignment and
power control is adopted as the main strategy to minimize the total service
cost, while both cases with non-causal and causal side information are
considered. With non-causal side information, a Greedy Assignment algorithm
with low complexity and near-optimal performance is proposed. With causal side
information, the design problem is formulated as a discrete Markov decision
problem. Interesting solution structures are derived, which shall help to
develop an efficient monotone backward induction algorithm. To further reduce
complexity, a Look-Ahead policy and a Threshold-based Heuristic policy are also

structure of these distinct sources of pathology. Using structural MRI data, we
identify areas in fronto-temporo-parietal cortex with reduced gray matter

between different components required to convert it into a split link. We
obtain a lower bound on the splitting number in terms of the (multivariable)
signature and nullity. Although very elementary and easy to compute, this bound
turns out to be suprisingly efficient. In particular, it makes it a routine
check to recover the splitting number of 129 out of the 130 prime links with at
most 9 crossings. Also, we easily determine 16 of the 17 splitting numbers that
were studied by Batson and Seed using Khovanov homology, and later computed by
Cha, Friedl and Powell using a variety of techniques. Finally, we determine the
splitting number of a large class of 2-bridge links which includes examples
recently computed by Borodzik and Gorsky using a Heegaard Floer theoretical
criterion.

provide an algorithm to mark significant local modes, which are associated to
informative sample clusters, and we derive its consistency properties. Our
theory is developed under weak assumptions, which essentially reduce to the
integrability of the random curves, and does not require to project the random
curves on a finite-dimensional subspace. However, if the underlying probability
distribution is supported on a finite-dimensional subspace, we show that the
pseudo-density and the expectation of a kernel density estimator induce the
same gradient flow, and therefore the same clustering. Although our theory is
developed for smooth curves that belong to an infinite-dimensional functional
space, we also provide consistent procedures that can be used with real data

systems. Here, firstly, a simple result is presented on the time evolution of
the non Neumann entropy under the Lindblad equation, which enables one to
examine if the entropy increases/decreases. Then, secondly, the following
question is posed: In a quantum open system with a time-dependent Hamiltonian,
what is the corresponding Lindblad equation for the quantum state that keeps
the internal energy of the system constant in time? This issue is of importance
in realizing quasi-stationary states of open systems such as quantum circuits
and batteries. As an illustrative example, the time-dependent harmonic
oscillator is analyzed. The Lindbladian operator is uniquely determined with
the help of a Lie-algebraic structure, and the time derivative of the von
Neumann entropy is shown to be nonnegative depending on the time-dependence of
the Hamiltonian.

during what part of the field cycle they are initiated. By changing the
sub-cycle character of the laser electric field it is possible to control such
phenomena. For long pulses, sub-cycle shaping of the field can be done by
adding a relatively weak, second harmonic of the driving field to the pulse.
Through constructive and destructive interference, the combination of strong
and weak fields can be used to change the probability of a strong-field process
being initiated at any given part of the cycle. In order to control sub-cycle
phenomena with optimal accuracy, it is necessary to know the phase difference
of the strong and the weak fields precisely. If the weaker field is an even
harmonic of the driving field, electrons ionized by the field will be
asymmetrically distributed between the positive and negative directions of the
combined fields. Information about the asymmetry can yield information about
the phase difference. A technique to measure asymmetry for few-cycle pulses,
called Stereo-ATI (Above Threshold Ionization), has been developed by [Paulus G
G, et al 2003 Phys. Rev. Lett. 91]. This paper outlines an extension of this
method to measure the phase difference between a strong IR and its second
harmonic.

the smallness of the anisotropies, quantitative studies require careful
disentanglement of detector effects from the observation. We discuss an
iterative maximum-likelihood reconstruction that simultaneously fits cosmic ray
anisotropies and detector acceptance. The method does not rely on detector
simulations and provides an optimal anisotropy reconstruction for ground-based
cosmic ray observatories located in the middle latitudes. It is particularly
well suited to the recovery of the dipole anisotropy, which is a crucial
observable for the study of cosmic ray diffusion in our Galaxy. We also provide
general analysis methods for recovering large- and small-scale anisotropies
that take into account systematic effects of the observation by ground-based
detectors.

methods that use representations derived based on geometric, radiometric and

improvements on object detection/recognition challenge problems. This has been
made possible due to the availability of large annotated data, a better

in a disc system may be transported with the accreted matter. They can be
associated with either the central body and/or jet, and be fossil or dynamo
excited in situ. We consider dynamo excitation of magnetic fields in accretion
discs of accreting binary systems in an attempt to clarify possible
configurations of dynamo generated magnetic fields. We first model the entire
disc with realistic radial extent and thickness using an alpha-quenching
non-linearity. We then study the simultaneous effect of feedback from the
Lorentz force from the dynamo-generated field. We perform numerical simulations
in the framework of a relatively simple mean-field model which allows the
generation of global magnetic configurations. We explore a range of
possibilities for the dynamo number, and find quadrupolar-type solutions with
irregular temporal oscillations that might be compared to observed rapid
luminosity fluctuations. The dipolar symmetry models with $R_\alpha<0$ have
lobes of strong toroidal field adjacent to the rotation axis that could be
relevant to jet launching phenomena. We have explored and extended the
solutions known for thin accretion discs.

employed to relate (peak) subhalo mass to dwarf stellar mass, and we use

the metallicity distribution of the accreted stellar material. The dominant
contributors to the accreted stellar mass are relatively massive dwarfs with
M_star ~ 10^8-10^10 M_sun. Halos with more quiescent accretion histories tend
to have lower mass progenitors (10^8-10^9 M_sun), and lower overall accreted
stellar masses. Ultra-faint mass (M_star < 10^5 M_sun) dwarfs contribute a
negligible amount (<< 1%) to the accreted stellar mass and, despite having low
average metallicities, supply a small fraction (~2-5 %) of the very metal-poor
stars with [Fe/H] < -2. Dwarfs with masses 10^5 < M_star/M_sun < 10^8 provide a
substantial amount of the very metal-poor stellar material (~40-80 %), and even
relatively metal-rich dwarfs with M_star > 10^8 M_sun can contribute a
considerable fraction (~20-60 %) of metal-poor stars if their metallicity
distributions have significant metal-poor tails. Finally, we find that the
generic assumption of a quiescent assembly history for the MW halo seems to be
in tension with the mass spectrum of its surviving dwarfs. We suggest that the

gaseous disk passively heated by the central star, under the periodic forcing
of shadows with an opening angle of $\sim$28$^\circ$. With a lower pressure
under the shadows, each crossing results in a variable azimuthal acceleration,
which in time develops into spiral density waves. Their pitch angles evolve
from $\Pi \sim 15^\circ-22^\circ$ at the onset, to $\sim$11$^\circ$-14$^\circ$,
over $\sim$65~AU to 150~AU. Self-gravity enhances the density contrast of the
spiral waves, as also reported previously for spirals launched by planets. Our
control simulations with unshadowed irradiation do not develop structures,
except for a different form of spiral waves seen at later times only in the
gravitationally unstable control case. Scattered light predictions in the

super-Eddington accretion. An alternative route is to start from heavy seeds
formed by the direct collapse of gas onto a ~ 10^5 Msun BH. Here we investigate
the relative role of light and heavy seeds as BH progenitors of the first
SMBHs. We use the cosmological, data constrained semi-analytic model
GAMETE/QSOdust to simulate several independent merger histories of z > 6
quasars. Using physically motivated prescriptions to form light and heavy seeds
in the progenitor galaxies, we find that the formation of a few heavy seeds
(between 3 and 30 in our reference model) enables the Eddington-limited growth
of SMBHs at z > 6. This conclusion depends sensitively on the interplay between
chemical, radiative and mechanical feedback effects, which easily erase the
conditions that allow the suppression of gas cooling in the low metallicity gas
(Z < Zcr and JLW > Jcr). We find that heavy seeds can not form if dust cooling
triggers gas fragmentation above a critical dust-to-gas mass ratio (D > Dcr).
In addition, the relative importance of light and heavy seeds depends on the
adopted mass range for light seeds, as this dramatically affects the history of
cold gas along the merger tree, by both SN and AGN-driven winds.

stellar structure change influences the external magnetic field topology and,

and intrinsic colour scale, we deredden the photometry using colours
appropriate for each spectral type, and determine the stellar mass, age, and
internal structure consistently for the entire sample. We find that PMS stars
on Henyey tracks have, on average, lower fractional X-ray luminosities ($L_{\rm
X}/L_\ast$) than those on Hayashi tracks, where this effect is driven by
changes in $L_{\rm X}$. X-ray emission decays faster with age for higher mass
PMS stars. There is a strong correlation between $L_\ast$ and $L_{\rm X}$ for
Hayashi track stars but no correlation for Henyey track stars. There is no
correlation between $L_{\rm X}$ and radiative core mass or radius. However, the
longer stars have spent with radiative cores, the less X-ray luminous they
become. The decay of coronal X-ray emission from young early K to late G-type
PMS stars, the progenitors of main sequence A-type stars, is consistent with
the dearth of X-ray detections of the latter.

measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation and to
characterize the polarization of galactic dust. EBEX was launched December 29,
2012 and circumnavigated Antarctica observing $\sim$6,000 square degrees of sky
during 11 days at three frequency bands centered around 150, 250 and 410 GHz.
EBEX was the first experiment to operate a kilo-pixel array of transition-edge
sensor bolometers and a continuously rotating achromatic half-wave plate aboard
a balloon platform. It also pioneered the use of detector readout based on
digital frequency domain multiplexing.
  We describe the temperature calibration of the experiment. The gain response
of the experiment is calibrated using a two-step iterative process. We use
signals measured on passes across the Galactic plane to convert from
readout-system counts to power. The effective smoothing scale of the EBEX
optics and the star camera-to-detector offset angles are determined through
\c{hi}2 minimization using the compact HII region RCW 38. This two-step process
is initially performed with parameters measured before the EBEX 2013 flight and
then repeated until the calibration factor and parameters converge.

based on solving optimisation problems constrained by partial differential

become unbound from the system. Because the ejected material is extremely
neutron-rich, the r-process rapidly synthesizes heavy nuclides as the material
expands and cools. In this work, we map general relativistic models of black
hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers into a Newtonian smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) code and follow the evolution of the thermodynamics and
morphology of the ejecta until the outflows become homologous. We investigate
how the subsequent evolution depends on our mapping procedure and find that the
results are robust. Using thermodynamic histories from the SPH particles, we
then calculate the expected nucleosynthesis in these outflows while varying the
level of neutrino irradiation coming from the postmerger accretion disk. We
find that the ejected material robustly produces r-process nucleosynthesis even
for unrealistically high neutrino luminosities, due to the rapid velocities of
the outflow. Nonetheless, we find that neutrinos can have an impact on the
detailed pat- tern of the r-process nucleosynthesis. Electron neutrinos are
captured by neutrons to produce protons while neutron capture is occurring. The
produced protons rapidly form low mass seed nuclei for the r-process. These low
mass seeds are eventually incorporated into the first r-process peak at A~78,
producing mainly Ge and Se. We consider the mechanism of this process in detail
and discuss if it can impact galactic chemical evolution of the first peak

coefficients of ideal Bose and Fermi gases which are trapped under generic

virial coefficients, one can produce the known results in $d=3$ and $d=2$. But
more importantly we found that, the virial coefficients of bosons and fermions
become equal (except the the second virial coefficient, where the sign is
different) when we trap the gases under harmonic potential in $d=1$. This
result suggests the equivalence between Bose and Fermi gases which is already
established for $d=1$ by M M Faruk (J Stat Phys, DOI

variety of learning tasks. When such methods are provided with sufficient
training data, broadly-applicable classes of nonlinear functions can be
approximated with desired accuracy. Nevertheless, inherent to the nonparametric
nature of kernel-based estimators are computational and memory requirements
that become prohibitive with large-scale datasets. In response to this
formidable challenge, the present work puts forward a low-rank, kernel-based,
feature extraction approach that is particularly tailored for online operation,
where data streams need not be stored in memory. A novel generative model is
introduced to approximate high-dimensional (possibly infinite) features via a
low-rank nonlinear subspace, the learning of which leads to a direct kernel
function approximation. Offline and online solvers are developed for the
subspace learning task, along with affordable versions, in which the number of
stored data vectors is confined to a predefined budget. Analytical results
provide performance bounds on how well the kernel matrix as well as
kernel-based classification and regression tasks can be approximated by
leveraging budgeted online subspace learning and feature extraction schemes.
Tests on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate and benchmark the efficiency
of the proposed method when linear classification and regression is applied to
the extracted features.

and quantifying such waves in the B ring has been challenging because of this
ring's high opacity and abundant fine-scale structure. Using a wavelet-based
analyses of 17 occultations of the star gamma Crucis observed by the Visual and
Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft, we are
able to examine five density waves in the B ring. Two of these waves are
generated by the Janus 2:1 and Mimas 5:2 Inner Lindblad Resonances at 96,427 km
and 101,311 km from Saturn's center, respectively. Both of these waves can be
detected in individual occultation profiles, but the multi-profile wavelet
analysis reveals unexpected variations in the pattern speed of the Janus 2:1
wave that might arise from the periodic changes in Janus' orbit. The other
three wave signatures are associated with the Janus 3:2, Enceladus 3:1 and
Pandora 3:2 Inner Lindblad Resonances at 115,959 km, 115,207 km and 108,546 km.
These waves are not visible in individual profiles, but structures with the
correct pattern speeds can be detected in appropriately phase-corrected average
wavelets. Estimates of the ring's surface mass density derived from these five
waves fall between 40 and 140 g/cm^2, even though the ring's optical depth in

U metal and U-Zr alloy accurately, and 2) DFT + U models them worse than DFT
according to results they calculate or select from our recent study [Phys. Rev.
B 88, 235128 (2013)]. Here we demonstrate in response to 1) that previously
neglected and more recent experimental data indicate that DFT, even when
implemented in all-electron methods, does not model the bulk modulus and
elastic constants of {\alpha}U very accurately. Furthermore, Soderlind et al.'s
claim that deficiency exists in our PAW calculation is unfounded and hence our
results, including those that show DFT results compare unfavorably with
experimental/computational references, are valid. We also demonstrate in
response to 2) that Soderlind et al.'s arguments are unsound for three reasons.
First, they focus on just the BCC phases {\gamma}U and {\gamma}(U,Zr)--which at
the ab initio modeling temperature of 0 K are unstable and hence difficult to
model and benchmar--as primary subjects of examination; however it is results
for the stable phases mostly neglected by Soderlind et al. that are the primary
evidence of our argument. Second, they make unfounded generalization of DFT + U
results at selected U eff values to argue that DFT + U in general gives wrong
or unsatisfactory results. Third, some key points in Soderlind et al.'s
criticisms of DFT + U are not well supported, including the claims that for
{\gamma}(U,Zr) DFT + U at Ueff = 1.24 eV gives positive deviations from linear
dependence of composition that are unprecedentedly large and partially negative
enthalpies of mixing that are inconsistent with the existence of miscibility
gap in the experimental phase diagram. We therefore maintain our conclusion
that DFT + U can be of value for modeling U and U-Zr.

the wind interacting with the vegetation canopy generates coherent billows and
that these billows are the dominant source of momentum into the wetland water
column. Spectral analysis of velocity timeseries shows that the spectral peak
in water velocity is aligned with the spectral peak of in-canopy wind velocity,
and that this peak corresponds with the Kelvin-Helmholtz billow frequency
predicted by mixing layer theory. We also observe a strong correlation in the
temporal pattern of velocity variance in the air and water, with high variance
events having similar timing and duration both above and below the air-water
interface. Water-side variance appears coupled with air-side variance at least
down to 5 cm, while the theoretical Stokes' solution predicts momentum transfer
down to only 2 mm assuming transfer via molecular viscosity alone. This

possible to ensure that evidence that they happened at some point in the past
remains for later detection. Evidence-based dynamic analysis allows execution
to proceed at nearly full speed until the end of an epoch (e.g., a heavyweight
system call). It then examines program state to check for evidence that an
error occurred at some time during that epoch. If so, it rolls back execution
and re-executes the code with instrumentation activated to pinpoint the error.
  We present DoubleTake, a prototype evidence-based dynamic analysis framework.
DoubleTake is practical and easy to deploy, requiring neither custom hardware,
compiler, nor operating system support. We demonstrate DoubleTake's generality
and efficiency by building dynamic analyses that find buffer overflows, memory
use-after-free errors, and memory leaks. Our evaluation shows that DoubleTake
is efficient, imposing just 4% overhead on average, making it the fastest such

end, we propose a model for such interactions that is simple enough to enable
formal analysis, but is sufficient to predict how such interactions will

between spouses, we suggest a model with two reciprocating attitudes where an
agent's action is a weighted combination of the others' last actions (reacting)
and either i) her innate kindness, or ii) her own last action (inertia). We
analyze a network of repeatedly interacting agents, each having one of these
attitudes, and prove that their actions converge to specific limits.
Convergence means that the interaction stabilizes, and the limits indicate the
behavior after the stabilization. For two agents, we describe the interaction
process and find the limit values. For a general connected network, we find
these limit values if all the agents employ the second attitude, and show that
the agents' actions then all become equal. In the other cases, we study the
limit values using simulations. We discuss how these results predict the

type-II Weyl fermions offer a rare platform for realizing many exotic physical
phenomena that are different from type-I Weyl systems. Here we construct the
acoustic version of type-II Weyl Hamiltonian by stacking one-dimensional
dimerized chains of acoustic resonators. This acoustic type-II Weyl system
exhibits distinct features in finite density of states and unique transport
properties of Fermi-arc-like surface states. In a certain momentum space

direction of the type-II Weyl nodes, rather than the chirality dictated by the

topological phases at different dimensions with the same building blocks.

repeated interactions. When individuals meet repeatedly, they can use
conditional strategies to enforce cooperative outcomes that would not be
feasible in one-shot social dilemmas. Direct reciprocity requires that
individuals keep track of their past interactions and find the right response.
However, there are natural bounds on strategic complexity: Humans find it
difficult to remember past interactions accurately, especially over long
timespans. Given these limitations, it is natural to ask how complex strategies
need to be for cooperation to evolve. Here, we study stochastic evolutionary
game dynamics in finite populations to systematically compare the evolutionary
performance of reactive strategies, which only respond to the co-player's
previous move, and memory-one strategies, which take into account the own and
the co-player's previous move. In both cases, we compare deterministic strategy
and stochastic strategy spaces. For reactive strategies and small costs, we
find that stochasticity benefits cooperation, because it allows for
generous-tit-for-tat. For memory one strategies and small costs, we find that
stochasticity does not increase the propensity for cooperation, because the
deterministic rule of win-stay, lose-shift works best. For memory one
strategies and large costs, however, stochasticity can augment cooperation.

optimal performance in consensus protocol design for practical multi-agent
systems (MASs). This paper investigates the optimal consensus problem for
general linear MASs subject to control input constraints. Two classes of MASs
including subsystems with semi-stable and unstable dynamics are considered. For
both classes of MASs without input constraints, the results on designing
optimal consensus protocols are first developed by inverse optimality approach.
Utilizing the optimal consensus protocols, the receding horizon control
(RHC)-based consensus strategies are designed for these two classes of MASs
with input constraints. The conditions for assigning the cost functions
distributively are derived, based on which the distributed RHC-based consensus
frameworks are formulated. Next, the feasibility and consensus properties of
the closed-loop systems are analyzed. It is shown that 1) the optimal
performance indices under the inverse optimal consensus protocols are coupled
with the network topologies and the system matrices of subsystems, but they are
different for MASs with semi-stable and unstable subsystems; 2) the unstable
modes of subsystems impose more stringent requirements for the parameter
design; 3) the designed RHC-based consensus strategies can make the control
input constraints fulfilled and ensure consensus for the closed-loop systems in
both cases. But for MASs with semi-stable subsystems, the {\em convergent
consensus} can be reached. Finally, two examples are provided to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed results.

assume that each user knows all direct and cross link channel gains. Later, we
assume that each user knows channel gains of only the links that are incident
on its receiver. Lastly, we assume that each user knows only its own direct
link channel gain. In all cases, we formulate the problem of finding a Nash

heuristic for solving a VI. We use this heuristic to solve for a NE of power
allocation games with partial information. We also present a lower bound on the

allocation that requires only knowledge of the distribution of a user's own

in many different visual tasks. Learned from a large-scale training dataset,
CNN features are much more discriminative and accurate than the hand-crafted
features. Moreover, CNN features are also transferable among different domains.
On the other hand, traditional dictionarybased features (such as BoW and SPM)
contain much more local discriminative and structural information, which is
implicitly embedded in the images. To further improve the performance, in this
paper, we propose to combine CNN with dictionarybased models for scene
recognition and visual domain adaptation. Specifically, based on the well-tuned
CNN models (e.g., AlexNet and VGG Net), two dictionary-based representations
are further constructed, namely mid-level local representation (MLR) and
convolutional Fisher vector representation (CFV). In MLR, an efficient
two-stage clustering method, i.e., weighted spatial and feature space spectral
clustering on the parts of a single image followed by clustering all
representative parts of all images, is used to generate a class-mixture or a
classspecific part dictionary. After that, the part dictionary is used to
operate with the multi-scale image inputs for generating midlevel
representation. In CFV, a multi-scale and scale-proportional GMM training
strategy is utilized to generate Fisher vectors based on the last convolutional
layer of CNN. By integrating the complementary information of MLR, CFV and the
CNN features of the fully connected layer, the state-of-the-art performance can
be achieved on scene recognition and domain adaptation problems. An interested
finding is that our proposed hybrid representation (from VGG net trained on
ImageNet) is also complementary with GoogLeNet and/or VGG-11 (trained on

work is a correctness result (complete performance guarantee) for this
algorithm under reasonably mild assumptions. By using extra assumptions --
accurate initial subspace knowledge, slow subspace change, and clustered
eigenvalues -- we are able to remove one important limitation of batch RPCA
results and two key limitations of a recent result for ReProCS for online RPCA.
To our knowledge, this work is among the first few correctness results for
online RPCA. Most earlier results were only partial results, i.e., they
required an assumption on intermediate algorithm estimates.

deviations of these moments from the Standard Model values are analyzed in an
effective Lagrangian approach, thus providing model-independent results.
Analytic expressions for the relevant non-standard contributions to the

performed in the conditions of the Belle and Belle II experiments at the KEKB

as a spreading process driven to large extent by social influence and
conditioned by the needs and capacities of individuals. To model this process
one usually introduces behavioural threshold mechanisms, which can give rise to
the evolution of global cascades if the system satisfies a set of conditions.
However, these models do not address temporal aspects of the emerging cascades,
which in real systems may evolve through various pathways ranging from slow to
rapid patterns. Here we fill this gap through the analysis and modelling of
product adoption in the world's largest voice over internet service, the social
network of Skype. We provide empirical evidence about the heterogeneous
distribution of fractional behavioural thresholds, which appears to be
independent of the degree of adopting egos. We show that the structure of
real-world adoption clusters is radically different from previous theoretical
expectations, since vulnerable adoptions --induced by a single adopting
neighbour-- appear to be important only locally, while spontaneous adopters
arriving at a constant rate and the involvement of unconcerned individuals
govern the global emergence of social spreading.

open access to their data, particularly to real-time status reports on their

particular interest to BSS providers to update system structures and policies.
This work was motivated by interest in analyzing and comparing several European
BSSs to identify common operating patterns in BSSs and to propose practical
solutions to avoid potential issues. Our approach relies on the identification
of common patterns between and within systems. To this end, a model-based
clustering method, called FunFEM, for time series (or more generally functional
data) is developed. It is based on a functional mixture model that allows the
clustering of the data in a discriminative functional subspace. This model
presents the advantage in this context to be parsimonious and to allow the
visualization of the clustered systems. Numerical experiments confirm the good
behavior of FunFEM, particularly compared to state-of-the-art methods. The
application of FunFEM to BSS data from JCDecaux and the Transport for London
Initiative allows us to identify 10 general patterns, including pathological
ones, and to propose practical improvement strategies based on the system
comparison. The visualization of the clustered data within the discriminative
subspace turns out to be particularly informative regarding the system
efficiency. The proposed methodology is implemented in a package for the R
software, named funFEM, which is available on the CRAN. The package also
provides a subset of the data analyzed in this work.

wavelet denoising in statistical signal processing and analysis. It has a
single parameter that controls a threshold level on wavelet coefficients and,
simultaneously, amount of shrinkage for coefficients of un-removed components.
This parametrization is possible to cause excess shrinkage, thus, estimation
bias at a sparse representation; i.e. there is a dilemma between sparsity and
prediction accuracy. To relax this problem, we considered to introduce positive
scaling on soft-thresholding estimator, by which threshold level and amount of
shrinkage are independently controlled. Especially, in this paper, we proposed
component-wise and data-dependent scaling in a setting of non-parametric
orthogonal regression problem including discrete wavelet transform. We call our
scaling method adaptive scaling. We here employed soft-thresholding method
based on LARS(least angle regression), by which the model selection problem
reduces to the determination of the number of un-removed components. We derived
a risk under LARS-based soft-thresholding with the proposed adaptive scaling
and established a model selection criterion as an unbiased estimate of the
risk. We also analyzed some properties of the risk curve and found that the
model selection criterion is possible to select a model with low risk and high
sparsity compared to a naive soft-thresholding method. This theoretical
speculation was verified by a simple numerical experiment and an application to
wavelet denoising.

amplitude of the anisotropic velocity distribution function is proportional to
the heat conductivity and the heat conductivities perpendicular to the magnetic
field is strongly reduced, the first component of the anisotropic velocity
distribution function is predominant. The anisotropic velocity distribution
function induced by the temperature gradient along the back ground magnetic
field drives plasma kinetic instability and the circular polarized magnetic
plasma waves are excited. The instability is almost identical to Weibel
instability in weakly magnetized plasma. However, depending on whether wave
vectors of modes are parallel to or antiparallel to the back ground magnetic
field, the growth rate is suppressed or enhanced due to back ground magnetic
field. In the strongly magnetized plasma, one mode is stabilized and only one
of the modes remains unstable.

strategy. Our strategy has relevance in search for rare amounts of information
in online social networks. Our work also has implications for design of
efficient online networks that could have an impact on networks of human
collaboration, scientific collaboration and networks used in targeted manhunts.
Real world systems, like online social networks, have high associated delays
for long-distance links, since they are built on top of physical networks. Such
systems have been shown to densify. Hence such networks will have a
communication cost due to space and the requirement of maintaining connections.
We have incorporated such a non-spatial cost to communication. We introduce the
notion of a community size that increases with the size of the system, which is
shown to reduce the time to search for information in networks. Our final
strategy balances search times and participation costs and is shown to decrease
time to find information in decentralized search in online social networks. Our
strategy also balances strong-ties and weak-ties over long distances and may
ultimately lead to more productive and innovative networks of human
communication and enterprise. We hope that this work will lay the foundation
for strategies aimed at producing global scale human interaction networks that

inverters in terms of the total power losses incurred in maintaining synchrony
under persistent small disturbances. The inverters are modeled with variable
frequencies and voltages under droop control. For small fluctuations from a
steady state, these transient power losses can be quantified by an input-output
H2 norm of a linear system subject to distributed disturbances. We evaluate
this H2 norm under the assumption of a dominantly inductive network with
identical inverters. The results indicate that while phase synchronization, in
accordance with previous findings, produces losses that scale with a network's
size but only weakly depend on its connectivity, the losses associated with the
voltage control will be larger in a highly connected network than in a loosely

spectral properties of carbonaceous dust analogs from the FUV to the

produced analogs to carbonaceous interstellar dust encountered in various
phases of the interstellar medium: amorphous hydrogenated carbons (a-C:H), for
carbonaceous dust observed in the diffuse interstellar medium, and soot
particles, for the polyaromatic component. Analogs to a-C:H dust were produced
using a radio-frequency plasma reactor at low pressures, and soot nanoparticles
films were produced in an ethylene (C$_2$H$_4$) flame. We measured transmission
spectra of these thin films (thickness < 100 nm) in the far-ultraviolet (190 -
250 nm) and in the vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV; 50 - 190 nm) regions using the APEX
chamber at the DISCO beam line of the SOLEIL synchrotron radiation facility.
These were also characterized through infrared microscopy at the SMIS beam
line. We successfully measured the transmission spectra of these analogs from
{\lambda} = 1 {\mu}m to 50 nm. From these, we extracted the laboratory optical
constants via Kramers-Kronig inversion. We used these constants for comparison
to existing interstellar extinction curves. We extend the spectral measurements
of these types of carbonaceous analogs into the VUV and link the spectral
features in this range to the 3.4 {\mu}m band. We suggest that these two
materials might contribute to different classes of interstellar extinction

protein crystals from dilute solutions. While these have generally been thought

Furthermore, the observed clusters are stable for relatively long times.
Because protein aggregation plays an important role in some pathologies,
understanding the nature of such clusters is an important problem. One
mechanism for the stabilization of such structures was proposed by Pan, Vekilov

viability of the model. Here, we revisit that model and incorporate additional

The hypothesis is that a weak solution of oligomer species is unstable with

which are stabilized against growth by the monomer-oligomer reaction. Here, we
show that such a combination of processes can be understood using a simple

  Dependence Awareness","27 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables",,,,"cs.OH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The design of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) faces various new challenges that
are unheard of in the design of classical real-time systems. Power optimization
is one of the major design goals that is witnessing such new challenges. The
presence of interaction between the cyber and physical components of a CPS
leads to dependence between the time delay of a computational task and the
amount of workload in the next iteration. We demonstrate that it is essential
to take this delay-workload dependence into consideration in order to achieve
low power consumption.
  In this paper, we identify this new challenge, and present the first formal
and comprehensive model to enable rigorous investigations on this topic. We
propose a simple power management policy, and show that this policy achieves a
best possible notion of optimality. In fact, we show that the optimal power
consumption is attained in a ""steady-state"" operation and a simple policy of
finding and entering this steady state suffices, which can be quite surprising
considering the added complexity of this problem. Finally, we validated the
efficiency of our policy with experiments.

method to also account for different wetting conditions. This is achieved by
assigning the color information not only to fluid particles but also to virtual
wall particles that are required to enforce proper no-slip boundary conditions.
To extend the scope of the original SRDmc algorithm to e.g. immiscible
two-phase flow with viscosity contrast we implement an angular momentum
conserving scheme (SRDmc+). We perform extensive benchmark simulations to show
that a mono-phase SRDmc fluid exhibits bulk properties identical to a standard
SRD fluid and that SRDmc fluids are applicable to a wide range of immiscible
two-phase flows. To quantify the adhesion of a SRDmc+ fluid in contact to the
walls we measure the apparent contact angle from sessile droplets in mechanical
equilibrium. For a further verification of our wettability implementation we
compare the dewetting of a liquid film from a wetting stripe to experimental
and numerical studies of interfacial morphologies on chemically structured

level. This has been successfully done at the University of Vienna carried out
by the Bibliometrics and Publication Strategies Department of the Vienna
University Library. According to the department's philosophy, bibliometrics is
not only a helpful evaluation instrument in order to complement the peer review
system. It is also meant as a compass for researchers in the ""publish or
perish"" dilemma in order to increase general visibility and to optimize
publication strategies. The individual assessment comprises of an interview
with the researcher under evaluation, the elaboration of a bibliometric report
of the researcher's publication output, the discussion and validation of the
obtained results with the researcher under evaluation as well as further
optional analyses. The produced bibliometric reports are provided to the
researchers themselves and inform them about the quantitative aspects of their
research output. They also serve as a basis for further discussion concerning
their publication strategies. These reports are eventually intended for
informed peer review practices, and are therefore forwarded to the quality
assurance and the rector's office and finally sent to the peers. The most
important feature of the generated bibliometric report is its multidimensional
and individual character. It relies on a variety of basic indicators and
further control parameters in order to foster comprehensibility. Researchers,
administrative staff and peers alike have confirmed the usefulness of this
bibliometric approach. An increasing demand is noticeable. In total, 33
bibliometric reports have been delivered so far. Moreover, similar reports have
also been produced for the bibliometric assessment of two faculties with great
success.

present direct experimental evidence that SWCNT bundling is detrimental for
their performance. We combine floating catalyst synthesis of non-bundled,
high-quality SWCNTs with an aggregation chamber, in which bundles with mean
diameters ranging from 1.38 to 2.90 nm are formed from identical 3 microns long
SWCNTs. The as-deposited TCFs from 1.38 nm bundles showed sheet resistances of
310 Ohms/sq. at 90% transparency, while those from larger bundles of 1.80 and
2.90 nm only reached values of 475 and 670 Ohms/sq., respectively. Based on
these observations, we elucidate how networks formed by smaller bundles perform
better due to their greater interconnectivity at a given optical density.
Finally, we present a semi-empirical model for TCF performance as a function of
SWCNT mean length and bundle diameter. This gives an estimate for the ultimate
performance of non-doped, random network mixed-metallicity SWCNT TCFs at ~80
Ohms/sq. and 90% transparency.

physical parameters associated with radio galaxies. We find that the jet
density has limited influence on the structure for a given jet Mach number. The
speed of advance varies by a small factor for jet densities between 0.1 and
0.0001 of the ambient density while the cocoon and cavity evolution change from
narrow pressure balanced to wide over-pressure as the ratio falls. We also find
that the fraction of energy transferred to the ambient medium increases with
decreasing jet-ambient density ratio, reaching approx 80%. This energy is
predominantly in thermal energy with almost all the remainder in ambient
kinetic form. The total energy remaining in the lobe is typically under 5\%. We
find that radio galaxies with wide transverse cocoons can be generated through
slow precession at low Mach numbers. We explore a slow precession model in
which the jet direction changes very slowly relative to the jet flow dynamical
time. This reveals two separated bow shocks propagating into the ambient
medium, one associated with the entire lobe expansion and the other with the
immediate impact zone. The lobes generated are generally consistent with

ambiguous. Here we report experimental evidence for topological
superconductivity induced in a HgTe quantum well, a two-dimensional topological

demonstrates that the supercurrent has a $4\pi$-periodicity with the
superconducting phase difference as indicated by a doubling of the voltage step

perpendicular magnetic field shows that this $4\pi$-periodic supercurrent

Markovian dissipation from the computational complexity point of view. We focus
on XX chains whose NESS are matrix product operators (MPO), i.e. with
coefficients of a tensor operator basis described by transition amplitudes in
an auxiliary space. Encoding quantum algorithms in the auxiliary space, we show
that estimating expectations of operators, being local in the sense that each
acts on disjoint sets of few spins covering all the system, provides the
answers of problems at least as hard as, and believed by many computer
scientists to be much harder than, those solved by quantum computers. We draw
conclusions on the hardness of the above estimations.

agreement on a decision (or output) that is in the convex hull of the inputs at
the non-faulty processes. It is well-known that exact consensus is impossible
in an asynchronous system in presence of faults, and in a synchronous system,
n>=3f+1 is tight on the number of processes to achieve exact Byzantine
consensus with scalar inputs, in presence of up to f Byzantine faulty
processes. Recent work has shown that when the inputs are d-dimensional vectors
of reals, n>=max(3f+1,(d+1)f+1) is tight to achieve exact Byzantine consensus
in synchronous systems, and n>= (d+2)f+1 for approximate Byzantine consensus in
asynchronous systems.
  Due to the dependence of the lower bound on vector dimension d, the number of
processes necessary becomes large when the vector dimension is large. With the
hope of reducing the lower bound on n, we consider two relaxed versions of
Byzantine vector consensus: k-Relaxed Byzantine vector consensus and
(delta,p)-Relaxed Byzantine vector consensus. In k-relaxed consensus, the
validity condition requires that the output must be in the convex hull of
projection of the inputs onto any subset of k-dimensions of the vectors. For
(delta,p)-consensus the validity condition requires that the output must be
within distance delta of the convex hull of the inputs of the non-faulty
processes, where L_p norm is used as the distance metric. For
(delta,p)-consensus, we consider two versions: in one version, delta is a
constant, and in the second version, delta is a function of the inputs
themselves.
  We show that for k-relaxed consensus and (delta,p)-consensus with constant
delta>=0, the bound on n is identical to the bound stated above for the
original vector consensus problem. On the other hand, when delta depends on the
inputs, we show that the bound on n is smaller when d>=3.

because the masses of the individual stellar components can be derived with
high accuracy and in a model-independent way. In this work, we study Spica, an
eccentric double-lined spectroscopic binary system with a beta Cep type
variable primary component. We use state-of-the-art modelling tools to
determine accurate orbital elements of the binary system and atmospheric
parameters of both stellar components. We interpret the short-period
variability intrinsic to the primary component, detected on top of the orbital
motion both in the photometric and spectroscopic data. The non-LTE based
spectrum analysis reveals two stars of similar atmospheric chemical composition
consistent with the present day cosmic abundance standard defined by
Nieva&Przybilla (2012). The masses and radii of the stars are found to be
11.43+/-1.15 M_sun and 7.21+/-0.75 M_sun, and 7.47+/-0.54 R_sun and 3.74+/-0.53
R_sun for the primary and secondary, respectively. We find the primary
component to pulsate in three independent modes, of which one is identified as
a radial mode, while the two others are found to be non-radial, low degree l
modes. The frequency of one of these modes is an exact multiple of the orbital
frequency, and the l=m=2 mode identification suggests a tidal nature for this
particular mode. We find a very good agreement between the derived dynamical
and evolutionary masses for the Spica system to within the observational errors
of the measured masses. The age of the system is estimated to be 12.5+/-1 Myr.

  The best way to obtain a sufficiently accurate radiograph is by tracking
individual protons traversing the phantom

have used an ideal position sensitive detectors measuring a single proton

materials have been irradiated with a 3x3~cm$^{2}$ scattered proton beam, with
various beam energies. The simulations were done using the Geant4 simulation

mitochondrial membranes and bacterial inner membranes in a process driven by
the proton moving force (pmf), or uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to pump
protons against the concentration gradient across the membrane. ATPase is
composed of two rotary motors, F0 and F1, which generate the opposing rotation
and compete for control of their shared central gamma-shaft. Here we present a
self-consistent physical model of the F1 motor as a simplified two-state
Brownian ratchet based on the asymmetry of torsional elastic energy of the
coiled-coil gamma-shaft. This stochastic model unifies the physical description
of linear and rotary motors and explains the stepped unidirectional rotation of
the $\gamma$-shaft, in agreement with the `binding-change' ideas of Boyer.
Substituting the model parameters, all independently known from recent
experiments, our model quantitatively reproduces the ATPase operation, e.g. the
`no-load' angular velocity is ca. 400~rad/s anticlockwise at 4 mM ATP, in close
agreement with experiment. Increasing the pmf torque exerted by F0 can slow,
stop and overcome the torque generated by F1, switching from ATP hydrolysis to
synthesis at a very low value of `stall torque'. We discuss the matters of the
motor efficiency, which is very low if calculated from the useful mechanical
work it produces - but is quite high when the `useful outcome' is measured in
the number of H+ pushed against the chemical gradient in the F1 ATP-driven
operation.

the resulting GWs is much longer than the observational time span, we calculate
the variation of the GW amplitude, rather than the amplitude itself. We
investigate the dependence on the orbital elements and the second BH mass
taking the observational constraints into account. The frequency of the GWs is
too low to be detected with the conventional pulsar timing array and we propose
a new method to detect such low-frequency GWs with the distribution func- tion

O-star binary HD 149404 (O7.5If + ON9.7I, P = 9.81 days), which is thought to
have experienced a past episode of case A Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF). Using
phase-resolved spectroscopy, we performed the disentangling of the optical
spectra of the two stars. The reconstructed primary and secondary spectra were
then analysed with the CMFGEN model atmosphere code to determine stellar
parameters, such as the effective temperatures and surface gravities, and to
constrain the chemical composition of the components. We complemented the
optical study with the study of IUE spectra, which we compare to the synthetic
binary spectra. The properties of the stars were compared to evolutionary
models. We confirmed a strong overabundance in nitrogen ($\left[\rm
N/C\right]\sim150\left[\rm N/C\right]_{\odot}$) for the secondary and a slight
nitrogen overabundance ($\left[\rm N/C\right]\sim5\left[\rm
N/C\right]_{\odot}$) for the primary star. Comparing the two stars, we found
evidence for asynchronous rotation, with a rotational period ratio of $0.50 \pm
0.11$. The hypothesis of a past case A RLOF interaction in HD 149404 is most
plausible to explain its chemical abundances and rotational asynchronicity.
Some of the observed properties, such as the abundance pattern, are clearly a
challenge for current case A binary evolution models, however.

to study Witt equivalence of function fields of curves over global fields. In
this paper we extend these results to local case, i.e. we discuss Witt

we show that, modulo some additional assumptions, Witt equivalence of two such

show a range of spicule like features, including Type I, Type II (as well as

interpreted as flows would imply mass flow velocities in excess of 1000 km/s.
This article seeks to quantify and study rapidly appearing spicular type
events. We also compare the MOMFBD and speckle reconstruction techniques in
order to understand if such spicules are more favourably observed using a
particular technique. We use spectral imaging observations taken with the CRISP
on the Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope. Data was sampled at multiple positions
within the Halpha line profile for both an ondisk and limb location. The data
is host to numerous rapidly appearing features which are observed at different
locations within the Halpha line profile. The feature's durations vary between
10 and 20 s and lengths around 3500 km. Sometimes, a time delay in their
appearance between the blue and red wings of 3 and 5 s is evident, whereas
sometimes they are near simultaneous. In some instances features are observed
to fade and then re emerge at the same location several tens of seconds later.
We provide the first statistical analysis of these spicules and suggest that
these observations can be interpreted as the LOS movement of highly dynamic
spicules moving in and out of the narrow 60 mA transmission filter used to
observe in different parts of the Halpha line profile. The LOS velocity
component of the observed fast chromospheric features, manifested as Doppler
shifts, are responsible for their appearance in the red and blue wings of
Halpha line. Additional work involving data at other wavelengths is required to
investigate the nature of their possible wavelike activity.

through simulation studies using all-subsets regression and model selection via
maximum penalised likelihood and a generalised information criterion. For
Poisson data and log-linear regression, similar assessments are made using
maximum likelihood and the Akaike information criterion for minimally-supported

counter-rotating disks with a deep gap in the gas surface density separating
the inner disk (corotating with the star) and the outer counter-rotating disk.
The properties of these gaps are compared to those of planet-bearing gaps that
form in disks hosting giant planets. We employ numerical hydrodynamics
simulations of collapsing cores that are replenished from the local
counter-rotating environment, as well as numerical hydrodynamic simulations of
isolated disks hosting giant planets, to derive the properties of the gaps that
form in both cases. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that counter-rotating
disks can form for a wide range of mass and angular momentum available in the
local environment. The gap that separates both disks has a depletion factor
smaller than 1%, can be located at a distance from ten to over a hundred AU
from the star, and can propagate inward with velocity ranging from 1 AU/Myr to
>100 AU/Myr. Unlike our previous conclusion, the gap can therefore be a
long-lived phenomenon, comparable in some cases to the lifetime of the disk
itself. For a proper choice of the planetary mass, the viscous \alpha-parameter
and the disk mass, the planet-bearing gaps and the gaps in counter-rotating
disks may show a remarkable similarity in the gas density profile and depletion
factor, which may complicate their observational differentiation.

to understand geographical heterogeneity in health indicators when
full-coverage vital statistics are not available. For this endeavor
spatio-temporal smoothing is beneficial to alleviate problems of data sparsity.
The use of conventional hierarchical models requires careful thought since the
survey weights may need to be considered to alleviate bias due to nonrandom

estimation of child mortality rates in five-year time intervals in regions of
Tanzania. Data come from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted over the
period 1991-2010 and two demographic surveillance system sites. We derive a
variance estimator of under five years child mortality that accounts for the
complex survey weighting. For our application, the hierarchical models we
consider include random effects for area, time and survey and we compare models
using a variety of measures including the conditional predictive ordinate

requires an intricate understanding of tidal dynamics and the effects of
turbine placement on the local and regional scale flow. Numerical models have
contributed significantly towards this understanding, and more recently,
adjoint-based modelling has been employed to optimise the positioning of the
turbines in an array in an automated way and improve on simple, regular
man-made configurations. Adjoint-based optimisation of high-resolution and
ideally 3D transient models is generally a very computationally expensive
problem. As a result, existing work on the adjoint optimisation of tidal
turbine placement has been mostly limited to steady-state simulations in which
very high, non-physical values of the background viscosity are required to
ensure that a steady-state solution exists. However, such compromises may
affect the reliability of the modelled turbines, their wakes and interactions,
and thus bring into question the validity of the computed optimal turbine
positions. This work considers a suite of idealised simulations of flow past
tidal turbine arrays in a 2D channel. It compares four regular array
configurations, detailed by Divett et al. (2013), with the configuration found
through adjoint optimisation in a steady-state, high-viscosity setup. The
optimised configuration produces considerably more power. The same
configurations are then used to produce a suite of transient simulations that
do not use constant high-viscosity, and instead use large eddy simulation (LES)
to parameterise the resulting turbulent structures. It is shown that the LES
simulations produce less power than that predicted by the constant
high-viscosity runs. Nevertheless, they still follow the same trends in the
power curve throughout time, with optimised layouts continuing to perform
significantly better than simplified configurations.

constraints that Lorentz symmetry imposes on three-point amplitudes where the
asymptotic states can be massive. As it is well known, in the case of only
massless states the three-point amplitude is fixed up to a coupling constant by
these constraints plus some physical requirements. We find that a similar
statement can be made when some of the particles have mass. We derive the
generic functional form of the three-point amplitude by virtue of Lorentz
symmetry, which displays several functional structures accompanied by arbitrary
constants. These constants can be related to the coupling constants of the
theory, but in an unambiguous fashion only in the case of one massive particle.
Constraints on these constants are obtained by imposing that in the UV limit
the massive amplitude matches the massless one. In particular, there is a
certain Lorentz frame, which corresponds to projecting all the massive momenta
along the same null momentum, where the three-point massive amplitude is fully
fixed, and has a universal form.

$2\leq k < n$. There is a natural correspondence between the alternating

$\bigwedge^kV$. Let $\varepsilon_k:{\mathcal G}_k(V)\rightarrow
{\mathrm{PG}}(\bigwedge^kV)$ be the Plucker embedding of the $k$-Grassmannian
${\mathcal G}_k(V)$ of $V$. Then
$\varepsilon_k^{-1}(\ker(f)\cap\varepsilon_k(\mathcal{G}_k(V)))$ is a
hyperplane of the point-line geometry ${\mathcal G}_k(V)$. All hyperplanes of
${\mathcal G}_k(V)$ can be obtained in this way. For a hyperplane $H$ of
${\mathcal G}_k(V)$, let $R^\uparrow(H)$ be the subspace of ${\mathcal
G}_{k-1}(V)$ formed by the $(k-1)$-subspaces $A\subset V$ such that $H$
contains all $k$-subspaces that contain $A$. In other words, if $\varphi$ is
the (unique modulo a scalar) alternating $k$-linear form defining $H$, then the
elements of $R^\uparrow(H)$ are the $(k-1)$-subspaces $A = \langle a_1,\ldots,
a_{k-1}\rangle$ of $V$ such that $\varphi(a_1,\ldots, a_{k-1},x) = 0$ for all

$n-k$ is odd, then $R^\uparrow(H) \neq \emptyset$, since every $(k-2)$-subspace

we say that $R^\uparrow(H)$ is spread-like. In this paper we obtain some
results on $R^\uparrow(H)$ which answer some open questions from the literature

$R^\uparrow(H) \neq \emptyset$ but for one exception with ${\mathbb

with respect to a measurement task. Due to amplification, filtering,
quantization and internal noise sources physical measurement equipment in
general exhibits a nonlinear and random input-to-output behaviour. This usually
makes it impossible to accurately describe the underlying statistical system
model. When the individual operations are all known and deterministic, one can
resort to approximations of the input-to-output function. The problem becomes
challenging when the processing chain is not exactly known or contains
nonlinear random effects. Then one has to approximate the output distribution
in an empirical way. Here we show that by measuring the first two sample
moments of an arbitrary set of output transformations in a calibrated setup,
the output distribution of the actual system can be approximated by an
equivalent exponential family distribution. This method has the property that
the resulting approximation of the statistical system model is guaranteed to be
pessimistic in an estimation theoretic sense. We show this by proving that an
equivalent exponential family distribution in general exhibits a lower Fisher
information measure than the original system model. With various examples and a
model matching step we demonstrate how this estimation theoretic aspect can be
exploited in practice in order to obtain a conservative measurement-driven
quality assessment method for nonlinear measurement systems.

  by TDDFT","8 pages, 1 table, 8 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present the valence electron energy-loss spectrum and the dielectric
function of monoclinic hafnia (m-HfO$_2$) obtained from time-dependent
density-functional theory (TDDFT) predictions and compared to energy-filtered
spectroscopic imaging measurements in a high-resolution transmission-electron
microscope. Fermi's Golden Rule density-functional theory (DFT) calculations
can capture the qualitative features of the energy-loss spectrum, but we find
that TDDFT, which accounts for local-field effects, provides nearly
quantitative agreement with experiment. Using the DFT density of states and
TDDFT dielectric functions, we characterize the excitations that result in the
m-HfO$_2$ energy loss spectrum. The sole plasmon occurs between 13-16 eV,
although the peaks $\sim$28 and above 40 eV are also due to collective
excitations. We furthermore elaborate on the first-principles techniques used,
their accuracy, and remaining discrepancies among spectra. More specifically,
we assess the influence of Hf semicore electrons (5$p$ and 4$f$) on the
energy-loss spectrum, and find that the inclusion of transitions from the 4$f$
band damps the energy-loss intensity in the region above 13 eV. We study the
impact of many-body effects in a DFT framework using the adiabatic
local-density approximation (ALDA) exchange-correlation kernel, as well as from
a many-body perspective using a $GW$-derived electronic structure to account
for self-energy corrections. These results demonstrate some cancellation of
errors between self-energy and excitonic effects, even for excitations from the
Hf $4f$ shell. We also simulate the dispersion with increasing momentum
transfer for plasmon and collective excitation peaks.

immortal individuals equipped with a fitness value. Individuals produce
offspring with a rate given by their fitness, and offspring may either belong
to the same family, sharing the fitness of their parent, or be founders of new
families, with a fitness sampled from a fitness distribution. Examples that can
be embedded in this class are stochastic house-of-cards models, urn models with
reinforcement, and the preferential attachment tree of Bianconi and Barabasi.
Our focus is on the case when the fitness distribution has bounded support and
regularly varying tail at the essential supremum. In this case there exists a
condensation phase, in which asymptotically a proportion of mass in the
empirical fitness distribution of the overall population condenses in the
maximal fitness value. Our main results describe the asymptotic behaviour of
the size and fitness of the largest family at a given time. In particular, we
show that as time goes to infinity the size of the largest family is always
negligible compared to the overall population size. This implies that
condensation, when it arises, is non-extensive and emerges as a collective
effort of several families none of which can create a condensate on its own.
Our result disproves claims made in the physics literature in the context of
preferential attachment trees.

interference management schemes, BIA and a hybrid TIM-NOMA scheme, employed in
heterogeneous networks by applying user-pairing and Kronecker Product
representation. BIA manages inter- and intra-cell interference by antenna
selection and appropriate message scheduling. The hybrid scheme manages
intra-cell interference based on NOMA and inter-cell interference based on TIM.
We show that both schemes achieve at least double the rate of TDMA. The hybrid
scheme always outperforms TDMA and BIA in terms of Degrees of Freedom (DoF).
Comparing the two proposed schemes, BIA achieves more DoF than TDMA under

Euler equations that is provably positivity-preserving and can be applied on
both Cartesian and unstructured meshes. This method is the first case of a
single-stage, single-step method that is simultaneously high-order,
positivity-preserving, and operates on unstructured meshes. Time-stepping is
accomplished via the Lax-Wendroff approach, which is also sometimes called the
Cauchy-Kovalevskaya procedure, where temporal derivatives in a Taylor series in
time are exchanged for spatial derivatives. The Lax-Wendroff discontinuous
Galerkin (LxW-DG) method developed in this work is formulated so that it looks
like a forward Euler update but with a high-order time-extrapolated flux. In
particular, the numerical flux used in this work is a linear combination of a
low-order positivity-preserving contribution and a high-order component that
can be damped to enforce positivity of the cell averages for the density and
pressure for each time step. In addition to this flux limiter, a moment limiter
is applied that forces positivity of the solution at finitely many quadrature
points within each cell. The combination of the flux limiter and the moment
limiter guarantees positivity of the cell averages from one time-step to the
next. Finally, a simple shock capturing limiter that uses the same basic
technology as the moment limiter is introduced in order to obtain
non-oscillatory results. The resulting scheme can be extended to arbitrary
order without increasing the size of the effective stencil. We present
numerical results in one and two space dimensions that demonstrate the
robustness of the proposed scheme.

Program observations performed in 2003. We analyzed the X-ray emission of this
source exploiting the Swift-BAT survey data from December 2004 to March 2015,
and all the available Swift-XRT pointed observations. The source is detected at
a high significance level in the 123-month BAT survey data, with an average
15-150 keV flux of the source of ~1.6 mCrab. The timing analysis on the BAT
data reveals with a significance higher than 6 standard deviations the presence
of a modulated signal with a period of 3.945 d, that we interpret as the
orbital period of the binary system. The folded light curve shows a flat
profile with a narrow full eclipse lasting ~3.5% of the orbital period. We
requested phase-constrained XRT observations to obtain a more detailed
characterization of the eclipse in the soft X-ray range. Adopting resonable
guess values for the mass and radius of the companion star, we derive a
semi-major orbital axis of ~31 R_sun, equivalent to ~1.8 times the radius of
the companion star. From these estimates and from the duration of the eclipse
we derive an orbital inclination between 55 and 60 degrees. The broad band
time-averaged XRT+BAT spectrum is well modeled with a strongly absorbed flat
power law, with absorbing column N_H=7x 10^22 cm^(-2) and photon index
Gamma=0.5, modified by a high energy exponential cutoff at E_cut=14 keV.

the dynamics of a self-polarized system based on two layers coupled via
interlayer exchange (conservative coupling) and mutual spin torque (dissipative
coupling). An analytical description of the non-linear dynamics is proposed and
validated through numerical simulations. In contrast to the single layer model,
the phase equation of the coupled system has a contribution coming from the
dissipative part of the LLGS equation. It is shown that this is a major
contribution to the frequency mandatory to describe well the most basic
features of the dynamics of coupled systems. Using the proposed model a
specific feature of coupled dynamics is addressed: the redshift to blueshift
transition observed in the frequency current dependence of this kind of
exchange coupled systems upon increasing the applied field. It is found that
the blueshift regime can only occur in a region of field where the two linear
eigenmodes contribute equally to the steady state mode (i.e. high mode
hybridization). Finally, a general perturbed Hamiltonian equation for the
coupled system is proposed.

arisen. This paper contributes to the understanding of such complex and highly

SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility), for the microscopic simulation of traffic

the feasibility of the proposed framework as a practical means to experiment

of the filter follow ordinary differential equations of Riccati type. We rely
on basic theory about matrix Riccati equations to investigate their properties.
Firstly, we consider the asymptotic behaviour of the covariance matrices for an
increasing number of expert opinions on a finite time horizon. Secondly, we
state conditions for the convergence of the covariance matrices on an infinite
time horizon with regularly arriving expert opinions.
  Finally, we derive the optimal trading strategy of an investor. The optimal

functional of the conditional covariance matrices. Hence, our analysis of the

motivation for the control of the summability of time-correlations comes from a
quest for a rigorous control of the Green-Kubo correlation function in such a

  observations","17ps, 7figs",,,,"gr-qc astro-ph.CO hep-ph hep-th math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this letter, we introduce the astrophysical observations into the wormhole
research, which is not meant to general parameters constraints for the dark
energy models, in order to understand more about in which stage of the universe
evolutions wormholes may exist through the investigation of the evolution
behavior of the cosmic equation of state parameter. As a concrete instance, we
investigate the Ricci dark energy (RDE) traversable wormholes constrained by
astrophysical data-sets. Particularly, we can discover from Fig. \ref{fig5} of
the present work, when the effective equation of state parameter $\omega_X<-1$,
namely, the Null Energy conditions (NEC) is violated clearly, the wormholes
will appear (open). Subsequently, six specific solutions of static and
spherically symmetric traversable wormhole supported by the RDE are obtained.
Except for the case of constant redshift function, in which the solution is not
only asymptotically flat but also traversable, the remaining five solutions are
all not asymptotically flat, therefore, the exotic matter from the RDE fluids
is spatially distributed in the vicinity of the throat. Furthermore, we analyze
the physical characteristics and properties of the RDE traversable wormholes.
It is worth noting that, through the astrophysical observations, we get
constraints on the parameters of RDE model, explore the type of exotic RDE
fluids in different stages of the universe changing, limit the number of
available models for wormhole research, reduce the number of the wormholes
corresponding to different parameters for RDE model and provide a more apparent
picture for wormhole investigations from the new perspective of observational
cosmology background

  classical strings",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The discovery of the topological insulators has fueled a surge of interests
in the topological phases in periodic systems. Topological insulators have bulk
energy gap and topologically protected gapless edge states. The edge states in
electronic systems have been detected by observing the transport properties the
Hgte quantum wells. The electromagnetic analogues of such electronic edge
states have been predicted and observed in photonic crystals, coupled
resonators and linear circuits. However, the edge state spectrums of the two
dimensional insulators and their electromagnetic analogues haven't been
directly measured and thus the gaplessness of the edge states hasn't been
experimentally confirmed. Here I show the classical strings are more convenient
choice to study the topological phases than the electromagnetic waves. I found
that classical strings with periodic densities can simulate a variety of
topological phases in condensed matter physics including two dimensional
topological insulators, three dimensional topological semimetals and weak
topological insulators. Because the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the
strings can be easily measured, not only the gapless edge state spectrum but
also the bulk topological invariant can now be directly observed. Further more
I show the topological phase transitions can be simulated by the strings. My
results show the richness of topological phases of mechanical waves. I
anticipate my work to be a starting point to study the topological properties
of mechanical waves. Even richer topological phases other than those have been
found in electronics systems can be explored when we use more general
mechanical waves e.g. waves in membranes with periodic densities. These phases
may provide guides to hunt novel topological properties in other branches of
science.
