and R\'onyai. The prototype problem is to show that a polynomial $f\in
\mathbb{R}[x,y]$ has a large image on a Cartesian product $A\times B\subset
\mathbb{R}^2$, unless $f$ has a group-related special form. We discuss a number
of variants and generalizations. This includes the Elekes-Szab\'o problem,
which generalizes the Elekes-R\'onyai problem to a question about an upper
bound on the intersection of an algebraic surface with a Cartesian product, and
curve variants, where we ask the same questions for Cartesian products of
finite subsets of algebraic curves. These problems lie at the crossroads of
combinatorics, algebra, and geometry: They ask combinatorial questions about
algebraic objects, whose answers turn out to have applications to geometric
questions involving basic objects like distances, lines, and circles, as well
as to sum-product-type questions from additive combinatorics. As part of a
recent surge of algebraic techniques in combinatorial geometry, a number of
quantitative and qualitative steps have been made within this framework.
Nevertheless, many tantalizing open questions remain.

to define a sample of subhalos accreted from filaments as well as a control
sample of subhalos accreted from other directions. We use these samples to
study differences in satellite orbits produced by filamentary accretion. Our
results depend on host halo mass. We find that for low masses, subhalos
accreted from filaments show $\sim10\%$ shorter lifetimes compared to the
control sample, they show a tendency towards more radial orbits, reach halo
central regions earlier, and are more likely to merge with the host. For higher
mass halos this lifetime difference dissipates and even reverses for cluster
sized halos. This behavior appears to be connected to the fact that more
massive hosts are connected to stronger filaments with higher velocity
coherence and density, with slightly more radial subhalo orbits. Because
subhalos tend to follow the coherent flow of the filament, it is possible that
such thick filaments are enough to shield the subhalo from the effect of
dynamical friction at least during their first infall. We also identify subhalo
pairs/clumps which merge with one another after accretion. They survive as a
clump for only a very short time, which is even shorter for higher subhalo
masses, suggesting that the Magellanic Clouds and other Local group satellite
associations, may have entered the MW virial radius very recently and probably
are in their first infall. Filaments boost the accretion of satellite
associations.

smoothness, e.g. exotic $\mathbb{R}^{4}$, and quantum field theory were found.
Some of these relations are rooted in a relation to superstring theory and
quantum gravity. Therefore one would expect that exotic smoothness is directly
related to the quantization of general relativity. In this article we will
support this conjecture and develop a new approach to quantum gravity called
\emph{smooth quantum gravity} by using smooth 4-manifolds with an exotic
smoothness structure. In particular we discuss the appearance of a wildly
embedded 3-manifold which we identify with a quantum state. Furthermore, we
analyze this quantum state by using foliation theory and relate it to an
element in an operator algebra. Then we describe a set of geometric,
non-commutative operators, the skein algebra, which can be used to determine
the geometry of a 3-manifold. This operator algebra can be understood as a
deformation quantization of the classical Poisson algebra of observables given
by holonomies. The structure of this operator algebra induces an action by
using the quantized calculus of Connes. The scaling behavior of this action is
analyzed to obtain the classical theory of General Relativity (GRT) for large
scales. This approach has some obvious properties: there are non-linear
gravitons, a connection to lattice gauge field theory and a dimensional
reduction from 4D to 2D. Some cosmological consequences like the appearance of
an inflationary phase are also discussed. At the end we will get the simple
picture that the change from the standard $\mathbb{R}^{4}$ to the exotic
$R^{4}$ is a quantization of geometry.

scheme for this result is based on the real interference alignment approach.
While providing a good way to show degrees of freedom results, this technique
has the disadvantage of relying on the Khintchine-Groshev theorem and is
therefore limited to {\it almost all channel gains}. This means that there are
infinitely many channel gains, where the scheme fails. Furthermore, the real
interference alignment approach cannot be used to yield stronger constant-gap
results. We approach this topic from a signal-scale alignment perspective and
use the linear deterministic model as a first approximation. Here we can show a
constant-gap sum capacity for certain channel gain parameters. We transfer
these results to the Gaussian model and discuss the results.

without allowance for the white-light facular area, which has been reported as
being associated with cycle-to-cycle changes in the sunspot number - $foF2$

number $Rbb$, and the corrected number $Rc$ largely differ in their allowance
for the 'Waldmeier discontinuity' around 1945 (the correction factor for which
for $R$, $Rbb$ and $Rc$ is, respectively, zero, effectively over 20%, and
explicitly 11.6%). It is shown that for Solar Cycles 18 - 21, all three sunspot
data sequences perform well, but that the fit residuals are lowest and most
uniform for $Rbb$. We here use $foF2$ for those UTs for which $R$, $Rbb$, and
$Rc$ all give correlations exceeding 0.99 for intervals both before and after
the Waldmeier discontinuity. The error introduced by the Waldmeier
discontinuity causes $R$ to underestimate the fitted values based on the $foF2$
data for 1932 - 1945 but $Rbb$ overestimates them by almost the same factor,
implying that the correction for the Waldmeier discontinuity inherent in $Rbb$
is too large by a factor of two. Fit residuals are smallest and most uniform

Bayesian problem is then studied under both finite- and infinite-horizon
setups, based on which, the optimal solution to the original usage-constrained
problem can be readily established. Moreover, by capitalizing on the structures
of the optimal solution, a lower bound is obtained for the optimal expected
sample size. In addition, we also propose algorithms to approximately evaluate
the parameters in the optimal sequential test so that the sensor usage and
error probability constraints are satisfied. Finally, numerical experiments are
provided to illustrate the theoretical findings, and compare with the existing
methods.

mutated programs (i.e., mutants) from an original program. The concept of
mutation has been widely applied to various testing problems, including test
set selection, fault localization, and program repair. However, surprisingly
little focus has been given to the theoretical foundation of mutation-based
testing methods, making it difficult to understand, organize, and describe
various mutation-based testing methods.
  This paper aims to consider a theoretical framework for understanding
mutation-based testing methods. While there is a solid testing framework for
general testing, this is incongruent with mutation-based testing methods,
because it focuses on the correctness of a program for a test, while the
essence of mutation-based testing concerns the differences between programs
(including mutants) for a test.
  In this paper, we begin the construction of our framework by defining a novel
testing factor, called a test differentiator, to transform the paradigm of
testing from the notion of correctness to the notion of difference. We formally
define behavioral differences of programs for a set of tests as a mathematical
vector, called a d-vector. We explore the multi-dimensional space represented
by d-vectors, and provide a graphical model for describing the space. Based on
our framework and formalization, we interpret existing mutation-based fault
localization methods and mutant set minimization as applications, and identify
novel implications for future work.

the Teukolsky equation (satisfied by gauge-invariant null-decomposed curvature

guarantee larger minimum distances than known codes of similar parameters for
informed receivers. The constructed codes are also useful as error correcting
codes for index coding when the transmitter does not know the side information
available at the receivers.

unitarity and renormalizability are modified from those in relativistic
theories. For renormalizability, the conventional discussion of the power
counting conditions has to be extended. Because of the dependence of $S$-matrix
elements on the reference frame, unitarity requires stronger conditions than
those in relativistic cases. We show that the conditions for unitarity and
renormalizabilty are identical as in relativistic theories. We discuss the
importance of symmetries for a theory to be renormalizable.

Energy Harvesting (EH) low-power nodes that will consume power mostly for
Neighbor Discovery (ND) (i.e., identifying nodes within communication range).
Although ND protocols were developed for sensor networks, the challenges posed
by emerging EH low-power transceivers were not addressed. Therefore, we design
an ND protocol tailored for the characteristics of a representative EH
prototype: the TI eZ430-RF2500-SEH. We present a generalized model of ND
accounting for unique prototype characteristics (i.e., energy costs for
transmission/reception, and transceiver state switching times/costs). Then, we
present the Power Aware Neighbor Discovery Asynchronously (Panda) protocol in
which nodes transition between the sleep, receive, and transmit states. We
analyze \name and select its parameters to maximize the ND rate subject to a
homogeneous power budget. We also present Panda-D, designed for non-homogeneous
EH nodes. We perform extensive testbed evaluations using the prototypes and
study various design tradeoffs. We demonstrate a small difference (less then
2%) between experimental and analytical results, thereby confirming the
modeling assumptions. Moreover, we show that Panda improves the ND rate by up
to 3x compared to related protocols. Finally, we show that Panda-D operates
well under non-homogeneous power harvesting.

many genes in a diverse manner. It is widely believed that these alterations
follow combinatorial patterns that have a strong connection with the underlying
molecular interaction networks and functional pathways. A better understanding
of the generative mechanisms behind the mutation rules and their influence on
gene communities is of great importance for the process of driver mutations
discovery and for identification of network modules related to cancer
development and progression. We developed a new method for cancer mutation
pattern analysis based on a constrained form of correlation clustering.
Correlation clustering is an agnostic learning method that can be used for
general community detection problems in which the number of communities or
their structure is not known beforehand. The resulting algorithm, named $C^3$,
leverages mutual exclusivity of mutations, patient coverage, and driver network
concentration principles; it accepts as its input a user determined combination
of heterogeneous patient data, such as that available from TCGA (including
mutation, copy number, and gene expression information), and creates a large
number of clusters containing mutually exclusive mutated genes in a particular
type of cancer. The cluster sizes may be required to obey some useful soft size
constraints, without impacting the computational complexity of the algorithm.
To test $C^3$, we performed a detailed analysis on TCGA breast cancer and
glioblastoma data and showed that our algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art CoMEt method in terms of discovering mutually exclusive gene
modules and identifying driver genes. Our $C^3$ method represents a unique tool
for efficient and reliable identification of mutation patterns and driver
pathways in large-scale cancer genomics studies.

  figures, 9 tables, 1 appendix",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work presents a complete analysis of fermion fitting and proton decay in
a SUSY $SO(10)$ model previously suggested by Dutta, Mimura, and Mohapatra.
  A key question in any grand unified theory is whether it satisfies the
experimental lower limits on proton partial lifetimes. In generic models,
substantial fine-tuning is required among GUT-scale parameters to satisfy the
limits. In the proposed model, the ${\bf 10}$, $\overline{\bf{126}}$, and ${\bf
120}$ Yukawa couplings contributing to fermion masses have restricted textures
intended to give favorable results for proton lifetime, while still giving rise
to a realistic fermion sector, without the need for fine-tuning, even for large
$\tan\beta$, and for either type-I or type-II dominance in the neutrino mass
matrix.
  In this thesis, I investigate the above hypothesis at a strict numerical
level of scrutiny; I obtain a valid fit for the entire fermion sector for both
types of seesaw dominance, including $\theta_{13}$ in good agreement with the
most recent data. For the case with type-II seesaw, I find that, using the
Yukawa couplings fixed by the successful fermion sector fit, proton partial
lifetime limits are readily satisfied for all but one of the pertinent decay
modes for nearly arbitrary values of the triplet-Higgs mixing parameters, with
the $K^+ \bar\nu$ mode requiring a ${\cal O}(10^{-1})$ cancellation in order to
satisfy its limit. I also find a maximum partial lifetime for that mode of
$\tau(K^+ \bar\nu) \sim 10^{36}\,$years. For the type-I seesaw case, I find
that $K^+ \bar\nu$ decay mode is satisfied for any values of the triplet mixing
parameters giving no major enhancement, and all other modes are easily
satisfied for arbitrary mixing values; I also find a maximum partial lifetime
for $K^+ \bar\nu$ of nearly $10^{38}\,$years, which is sub-dominant to gauge
boson decay channels.

indispensable for measuring the Higgs couplings and their deviations from the
Standard Model in order to identify new physics models. The performance in
measuring the ZH cross section using events in which the Higgs boson recoils
against a Z boson which decays into a pair of muons or electrons has been
demonstrated based on full simulation of the ILD detector for three center of
mass energies 250, 350, and 500 GeV, and two beam polarizations (Pe-,Pe+)
=(-80%, +30%) and (+80%, -30%). This paper demonstrates in detail that the
analysis which achieved these results are model independent to the sub-percent
level. Data selection methods are designed to optimize the precisions of the ZH
cross section and at the same time minimize the bias on the measured due to
discrepancy in signal efficiencies among Higgs decay modes. Under conservative
assumptions which take into account unknown Higgs decay modes, the relative
bias on the ZH cross section is shown to be smaller than 0.2% for all
center-of-mass energies, which is five times below even the smallest ZH cross
section statistical uncertainties expected from the leptonic recoil
measurements in a full 20 years ILC physics program.

still unpredictable how drug efficacy depends on physicochemical properties and
delivery kinetics. The purpose of the current study is to provide a useful
mathematical model for drug release from a drug delivery device and consecutive
drug transport in biological tissue, thereby aiding the development of new
therapeutic drug by a systemic approach. In order to study the complete
process, a two-layer spatio-temporal model depicting drug transport between the
coupled media is presented. Drug release is described by considering
solubilisation dynamics of drug particle, diffusion of the solubilised drug
through porous matrix and also some other processes like reversible
dissociation / recrystallization, drug particle-receptor binding and
internalization phenomena. The model has led to a system of partial
differential equations describing the important properties of drug kinetics.
This model contributes towards the perception of the roles played by diffusion,
mass-transfer, particle binding and internalization parameters.

The use of the similitude regime in sharp indentation testing allows one to
record reliable data with a good spatial resolution that makes it possible to
deal with low loads (typically below 10 mN) and crack-free imprints. The
densified zone dissolves much quicker than the non densified regions. The
analysis of the results, along the vertical axis, indicates that the
densification zone is rather homogeneous with a steep transition to the non
densified zone. The size of the densification zone, with respect to the initial
free surface, is estimated to be around 1.9 the maximum penetration depth of
the instrumented indentation test. These findings are compared with former
experimental data and critically compared with the results of numerical
simulations from selected constitutive equations and other numerical techniques
from the literature. These comparisons highlight some advantages and
disadvantages of existing modelings and thus call for further advanced progress
on that matter. They nevertheless favor mostly the contribution of the
densification process with respect to the plastic flow (volume conservative

cases. First we consider a system configuration in which electromagnetic field
momentum is present even though the system is static. We trace the
electromagnetic momentum to be present in the form of a continuous transport of
electromagnetic energy from one part of the system to another, without causing
any net change in the energy of the system. In a second case we show that the
electromagnetic momentum is nil irrespective of whether the charged system is
stationary or in motion, even though the electromagnetic energy is present
throughout. We demonstrate that the conventional formulation of electromagnetic
field-momentum describes the systems consistently without any real
contradictions. Here we also make exposition of a curiosity where
electromagnetic energy decreases when the charged system gains velocity. Then
we discuss the more general question that has been raised -- Are the
conventional formulas for energy-momentum of electromagnetic fields valid for
all cases? Or more specifically, in the case of so-called ""bound fields,"" do we
need to change over to some modified definitions which have made their
appearance even in standard text books? We show that in all cases it is only
the conventional formulas which lead to results consistent with the rest of
physics, including the special theory of relativity, and that any proposed

inspired a surging interest in developing Pregel-like platforms featuring a
user-friendly ""think like a vertex"" programming model. Existing Pregel-like
systems support a fault tolerance mechanism called checkpointing, which
periodically saves computation states as checkpoints to HDFS, so that when a
failure happens, computation rolls back to the latest checkpoint. However, a
checkpoint in existing systems stores a huge amount of data, including vertex
states, edges, and messages sent by vertices, which significantly degrades the
failure-free performance. Moreover, the high checkpointing cost prevents
frequent checkpointing, and thus recovery has to replay all the computations
from a state checkpointed some time ago.
  In this paper, we propose a novel checkpointing approach which only stores
vertex states and incremental edge updates to HDFS as a lightweight checkpoint
(LWCP), so that writing an LWCP is typically tens of times faster than writing
a conventional checkpoint. To recover from the latest LWCP, messages are
generated from the vertex states, and graph topology is recovered by replaying
incremental edge updates. We show how to realize lightweight checkpointing with
minor modifications of the vertex-centric programming interface. We also apply
the same idea to a recently-proposed log-based approach for fast recovery, to
make it work efficiently in practice by significantly reducing the cost of
garbage collection of logs. Extensive experiments on large real graphs verified
the effectiveness of LWCP in improving both failure-free performance and the
performance of recovery.

of graph vertices participate in computation, but are not suitable for
processing light-workload graph queries where only a small fraction of vertices
need to be accessed. The programming paradigm adopted by these systems can
seriously under-utilize the resources in a cluster for graph query processing.
In this work, we develop a new open-source system, called Quegel, for querying
big graphs, which treats queries as first-class citizens in the design of its
computing model. Users only need to specify the Pregel-like algorithm for a
generic query, and Quegel processes light-workload graph queries on demand
using a novel superstep-sharing execution model to effectively utilize the
cluster resources. Quegel further provides a convenient interface for
constructing graph indexes, which significantly improve query performance but

that Quegel is highly efficient in answering various types of graph queries and

value to arbitrary collections of objects (with possible repetitions) in such a
way that the hash of the union of two collections is easy to compute from the
hashes of the two collections themselves: it is simply their sum under a
suitable group operation. In particular, hash values of large collections can
be computed incrementally and/or in parallel. Homomorphic hashing is thus a
very useful primitive with applications ranging from database integrity
verification to streaming set/multiset comparison and network coding.
  Unfortunately, constructions of homomorphic hash functions in the literature
are hampered by two main drawbacks: they tend to be much longer than usual hash
functions at the same security level (e.g. to achieve a collision resistance of
2^128, they are several thousand bits long, as opposed to 256 bits for usual
hash functions), and they are also quite slow.
  In this paper, we introduce the Elliptic Curve Multiset Hash (ECMH), which
combines a usual bit string-valued hash function like BLAKE2 with an efficient
encoding into binary elliptic curves to overcome both difficulties. On the one
hand, the size of ECMH digests is essentially optimal: 2m-bit hash values
provide O(2^m) collision resistance. On the other hand, we demonstrate a
highly-efficient software implementation of ECMH, which our thorough empirical
evaluation shows to be capable of processing over 3 million set elements per
second on a 4 GHz Intel Haswell machine at the 128-bit security level---many
times faster than previous practical methods.

many-body systems, it seems that there is not a one-to-one correspondence
between topological phases and quantum phases. As a well-known example, it has
been shown that all one-dimensional (1D) quantum phases are topologically
trivial\cite{spt}. By such a fact, it seems a challenging task to understand
when a quantum phase transition between different topological models
necessarily reveals different topological classes of them. In this paper, we
make an attempt to consider this problem by studying a phase transition between
two different quantum phases which belong to a universal topological phase. We
define a Hamiltonian which describes an interpolation between the toric code
model with $Z_2$ topological order and the color code model with $Z_2 \times
Z_2$ topological order on a hexagonal lattice. We show such a model is exactly
mapped to many copies of 1D quantum Ising model in transverse field by
rewriting the Hamiltonian in a new complete basis. Consequently, we show that
the universal topological phase of the color code model and the toric code
model reflects in the 1D nature of the phase transition. We also consider the
expectation value of Wilson loops by a perturbative calculation and show that
behavior of the Wilson loop captures the non-topological nature of the quantum
phase transition. The result on the point of phase transition also show that
the color code model is strongly robust against the toric code model.

between the heater and the liquid when the heat supply exceeds a critical
value. We propose a mechanism for the boiling crisis that is based on the
spreading of the dry spot under a vapor bubble. The spreading is initiated by
the vapor recoil force, a force coming from the liquid evaporation into the
bubble. Since the evaporation intensity increases sharply near the triple
contact line, the influence of the vapor recoil can be described as a change of
the apparent contact angle. Therefore, for the most usual case of complete
wetting of the heating surface by the liquid, the boiling crisis can be
understood as a drying transition from complete to partial wetting. The state
of nucleate boiling, which is boiling in its usual sense, is characterized by a
very large rate of heat transfer from the heating surface to the bulk because
the superheated liquid is carried away from the heating surface by the
departing vapor bubbles. If the heating power is increased, the temperature of
the heating surface increases with the heat flux. When the heat flux from the
heater reaches a threshold value q CHF (the critical heat flux, CHF), the vapor
bubbles suddenly form a film which covers the heating surface and insulates the
latter from the bulk of the liquid. The temperature of the heating surface
grows so rapidly that the heater can fuse unless its power is controlled. This
phenomenon is known under the names of ""boiling crisis,"" ""burnout,"" or
""Departure from Nucleate Boiling"" (DNB) [1]. The final state of this transition
is called film boiling. This problem has become very important since the
1940's, with the beginning of the industrial exploitation of heat exchangers
with large heat fluxes (as with nuclear power stations). Since then a huge
amount of research has been done for the various conditions of pool boiling
(boiling without imposed external flow) and flow boiling (boiling of the
flowing water) [2]. Numerous empirical correlations have been proposed, each
describing the dependence of the CHF on the physical parameters of the liquid
and of the heater more or less correctly for a particular geometry and
particular conditions of boiling [2]. A strong dependence of the threshold on
the details of the experimental setup coupled with difficulties in separating
the consequences of DNB from its causes is at the origin of a large number of
frequently controversial hypotheses [2]. The violence of boiling makes
observations quite difficult. Good quality photographic experiments are
presented in only a few articles (see e.g. [3] -- [6]). Despite an increasing
interest in the physical aspect of the problem during recent years [7,8] and
numerous empirical approaches, the underlying physics still remains obscure. In
this Letter, we propose a model based on a non-equilibrium drying transition.

eliminated using a transformation of the Horn clauses. We compare this approach
with two other methods; one of them uses interpolant tree automata in an

interpretation over the domain of convex polyhedra without the generalisation

the design of optical queues by using optical crossbar switches and fiber delay
lines (SDL). In this paper, we focus on the construction of an optical priority
queue with a single $(M+2)\times (M+2)$ crossbar switch and $M$ fiber delay
lines, and evaluate it in terms of the buffer size of the priority queue.
Currently, the best known upper bound of the buffer size is $O(2^M)$, while
existing methods can only construct a priority queue with buffer $O(M^3)$.
  In this paper, we make a great step towards closing the above huge gap. We
propose a very efficient construction of priority queues with buffer
$2^{\Theta(\sqrt{M})}$. We use 4-to-1 multiplexers with different buffer sizes,
which can be constructed efficiently with SDL, as intermediate building blocks
to simplify the design. The key idea in our construction is to route each
packet entering the switch to some group of four 4-to-1 multiplexers according
to its current priority, which is shown to be collision-free.

  In this paper we present an algorithm, which detects communities in dynamic

called hubs. Due to local message passing we can update the clustering results
with low computational power.
  The presented algorithm is compared with other for some static social
networks. The reached modularity is not as high as the Louvain method, but even
higher then spectral clustering. For large-scale real-world datasets with given
ground truth, we could reconstruct most of the given community structure. The

corresponding points under an affine transformation. In this paper, we
construct the moving frame and invariants for the discrete centroaffine curves,
which could be used to discriminate the same discrete curves from different
graphics, and estimate whether a polygon flow is stable or periodically stable.
In fact, using the similar method as the Frenet-Serret frame, a discrete curve
can be uniquely identified by its centroaffine curvatures and torsions. In
1878, Darboux studied the problem of midpoint iteration of polygons[12].
Berlekamp et al studied this problem in detail[2]. Now, through the
centroaffine curvatures and torsions, the iteration process can be clearly
quantified. Exactly, we describe the whole iteration process by using
centroaffine curvatures and torsions, and its periodicity could be directly
exhibited. As an application, we would obtain some stable discrete space curves
with changeless curvatures and torsions after multistep iteration. For the
pentagram map of a polygon, the affinely regular polygons are stable.
Furthermore, we find the convex hexagons with parallel and equi-length opposite
sides are periodically stable, and some convex parallel and equi-length
opposite sides octagons are also periodically stable. The proofs of these
results are obtained using the structure equations of the discrete cnetroaffine
curves and the integrable conditions of its flows.

the properties of a range of commonly used frequentist and Bayesian procedures

assessed. The Bayesian credibility intervals using weakly informative priors
for the between-trial heterogeneity exhibited coverage probabilities in excess
of the nominal level for a range of scenarios considered. However, they tended
to be shorter than those obtained by the Knapp-Hartung method, which were also
conservative. In contrast, methods based on normal quantiles exhibited
coverages well below the nominal levels in many scenarios. With very few
studies, the performance of the Bayesian credibility intervals is of course
sensitive to the specification of the prior for the between trial
heterogeneity. In conclusion, the use of weakly informative priors as
exemplified by half-normal priors (with scale 0.5 or 1.0) for log odds ratios
is recommended for applications in rare diseases.

Thanks to 6.5 years of data acquired by the \textit{Fermi}-LAT and the new

extended emission coming from RCW 86. The spectrum is described by a power-law
function with a very hard photon index ($\Gamma = 1.42 \pm 0.1_{\rm stat} \pm
0.06_{\rm syst}$) in the 0.1--500 GeV range and an energy flux above 100 MeV of

perform a broadband modeling of the nonthermal emission of RCW 86 to constrain

substrate often hamper the efficient modeling of microfluidic systems. In
particular, the selection of the effective boundary conditions, specifying the
contact line motion, is a controversial issue since the microscopic physics
that gives rise to this displacement is still unknown. Here, a sharp interface,
continuum-level, novel modeling approach, accounting for liquid/solid
micro-scale interactions assembled in a disjoining pressure term, is presented.
By following a unified conception (the model applies both to the liquid/solid
and the liquid/ambient interfaces), the friction forces at the contact line, as
well as the dynamic contact angle are derived implicitly as a result of the
disjoining pressure and viscous effects interplay in the vicinity of the
substrate's intrinsic roughness. Previous hydrodynamic model limitations, of
imposing the contact line boundary condition to an unknown number and
reconfigurable contact lines, when modeling the spreading dynamics on textured
substrates, are now overcome. The validity of our approach is tested against
experimental data of a droplet impacting on a horizontal solid surface. The
study of the early spreading stage on hierarchically structured and chemically
patterned solid substrates reveal an inertial regime where the contact radius
grows according to a universal power law, perfectly agreeing with recently
published experimental findings.

(3D-TI) Bi2-xSbxTe3-ySey (BSTS) ultrathin films, ranging from a few quintuple
to several hundreds of layaers, on mica in a large-area (1 cm2) via catalyst
free physical vapor deposition. These films can nondestructively be exfoliated
using deionized water and transferred to various kinds of substrates as
desired. The transferred BSTS thin films show good ambipolar characteristics as
well as well defined quantum oscillations arising from the topological surface
states. Carrier mobility of 2500-5100 cm2(Vs)-1 is comparable to the high
quality bulk BSTS single crystal. Moreover, tunable electronic states from the
massless to the massive Dirac fermion were observed with a decrease in the film
thickness. Both the feasible large area synthesis and the reliable film
transfer process can promise that BSTS ultrathin films will pave a route to
many applications of 3D-TIs.

their own interesting features but also suffer from some different drawbacks.
Recently, a novel gravity theory called hybrid metric-Palatini gravity was put
forward to cure or improve their individual deficiencies. The action of this
gravity theory is a hybrid combination of the usual Einstein-Hilbert action and
a $f(\mathcal{R})$ term constructed by the Palatini formalism. Interestingly,
it seems that the existence of a light and long-range scalar field in this
gravity may modify the cosmological and galactic dynamics without conflicting
with the laboratory and Solar System tests. In this paper we focus on the
tensor perturbation of thick branes in this novel gravity theory. We consider
two models as examples, namely, the thick branes constructed by a background
scalar field and by pure gravity. The thick branes in both models have no inner
structure. However, the graviton zero mode in the first model has inner
structure when the parameter in this model is larger than its critical value.
We find that the effective four-dimensional gravity can be reproduced on the
brane for both models. Moreover, the stability of both brane systems against
the tensor perturbation can also be ensured.

$N_{\nu}$. In all three catalogues we consistently observe a positive
fluctuation of $N_{\nu}$ with respect to the mean random expectation at a
significance level of $0.4 - 1.3$ per cent. This applies only to extreme
blazars, namely strong, very high energy $\gamma$-ray sources of the high
energy peaked type, and implies a model-independent fraction of the current
IceCube signal $\sim 10 - 20$ per cent. An investigation of the hybrid photon
-- neutrino spectral energy distributions of the most likely candidates reveals
a set of $\approx 5$ such sources, which could be linked to the corresponding
IceCube neutrinos. Other types of blazars, when testable, give null correlation
results. Although we could not perform a similar correlation study for Galactic
sources, we have also identified two (further) strong Galactic $\gamma$-ray
sources as most probable counterparts of IceCube neutrinos through their hybrid
spectral energy distributions. We have reasons to believe that our blazar
results are not constrained by the $\gamma$-ray samples but by the neutrino
statistics, which means that the detection of more astrophysical neutrinos

Consider a sum $S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n X_k$ of $n$ independent continuous random

R-EPI provides a lower bound on the order-$\alpha$ R\'enyi entropy power of

of the $n$ random vectors $\{X_k\}_{k=1}^n$. For $\alpha=1$, the R-EPI
coincides with the well-known entropy power inequality by Shannon. The first
improved R-EPI is obtained by tightening the recent R-EPI by Bobkov and
Chistyakov which relies on the sharpened Young's inequality. A further
improvement of the R-EPI also relies on convex optimization and results on
rank-one modification of a real-valued diagonal matrix.

interactions of quarks and gluons as a function of the momentum transfer $Q$.
The $Q^2$ dependence of the coupling is required to describe hadronic
interactions at both large and short distances. In this article we adopt the
light-front holographic approach to strongly-coupled QCD, a formalism which
incorporates confinement, predicts the spectroscopy of hadrons composed of
light quarks, and describes the low-$Q^2$ analytic behavior of the strong
coupling $\alpha_s(Q^2)$. The high-$Q^2$ dependence of the coupling
$\alpha_s(Q^2)$ is specified by perturbative QCD and its renormalization group
equation. The matching of the high and low $Q^2$ regimes of $\alpha_s(Q^2)$
then determines the scale $Q_0$ which sets the interface between perturbative
and nonperturbative hadron dynamics. The value of $Q_0$ can be used to set the
factorization scale for DGLAP evolution of hadronic structure functions and the
ERBL evolution of distribution amplitudes. We discuss the scheme-dependence of
the value of $Q_0$ and the infrared fixed-point of the QCD coupling. Our
analysis is carried out for the $\bar{MS}$, $g_1$, $MOM$ and $V$

of $\alpha_s$ at large distance seen in the literature can be explained by
different choices of renormalization schemes. We also provide the formulae to

solution to the projective translation equation
$\phi^{t+s}=\phi^{t}\circ\phi^{s}$, $t,s\in\mathbb{R}$.
  Previously we have developed an arithmetic, topologic and analytic theory of
$2$-dimensional projective flows: rational, algebraic, unramified, abelian
flows, commuting flows. The current paper is devoted to highly symmetric flows
- superflows. Within flows with a given symmetry, superflows are unique and
optimal.
  Our first result classifies all $2$-dimensional superflows. For any positive
integer $d$, there exists the superflow $\phi_{\mathbb{D}_{2d+1}}$ whose group
of symmetries is the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_{2d+1}$. In the current paper
we explore the superflow $\phi_{\mathbb{D}_{5}}$, which leads to investigation
of abelian functions over curve of genus $6$.
  The $3$-dimensional theory of projective flows is more involved. We
investigate two different $3$-dimensional superflows, whose group of symmetries
are, respectively, the full tetrahedral group $\widehat{\mathbb{T}}$ (all
symmetries of a tetrahedron), and the octahedral group $\mathbb{O}$
(orientation preserving symmetries of an octahedron), both isomorphic, though
non-equivalent as representations. The generic orbits of the first flow are
space curves of genus $1$, and the flow itself can be analytically described in
terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. The generic orbits of the second flow are
curves of genus $9$, and the flow itself can be described in terms of
Weierstrass elliptic functions (via reduction of hyper-elliptic functions to
elliptic).
  In the second part of this work we will classify all $3$-dimensional
superflows (including the icosahedral superflow), and in the third we
investigate superflows over $\mathbb{C}$.

In compressive spectrum sensing model, two scenarios are considered: 1) Single
SU, and 2) Multiple SUs. In the single SU scenario, in order to reduce the
energy consumption at the SU, compressive sensing technique which enables
sub-Nyquist sampling is utilized. In the multiple SUs scenario, cooperative
spectrum sensing (CSS) is performed with adopting low-rank matrix completion
technique to obtain the complete matrix at the fusion center. Throughput
optimizations of the secondary network are formulated into two linear
constrained problems, which aim to maximize the throughput of single SU and the
CSS networks, respectively. Three methods are provided to obtain the maximal
throughput of secondary network by optimizing the time slots allocation and the
transmit power. Simulation results show that: 1) Multiple SUs scenario can
achieve lower power outage probability than single SU scenario; and 2) The
optimal throughput can be improved by implementing compressive spectrum sensing

""continuity equation(s)"", resulting from the coupling between the positional
and the orientational order in main-chain polymer nematics, by showing that the
vectorial and tensorial forms of these equations are in general not equivalent
and can not be reduced to one another, but neither are they disjoint
alternatives. We analyze the relation between them and elucidate the
fundamental role that the chain backfolding plays in the determination of their
relative strength and importance. Finally, we show that the correct penalty
potential in the effective free energy, implementing these conservation laws,
should actually connect both the tensorial and the vectorial constraints. We
show that the consequences of the polymer chains connectivity for their
consistent mesoscopic description are thus not only highly non-trivial but that
its proper implementation is absolutely crucial for a consistent coarse grained
description of the main-chain polymer nematics.

and need to keep pace in order to survive. To understand the effect of climate
change on species ranges and its consequences on population dynamics, we
consider a space-time heterogeneous reaction-diffusion equation in dimension 1,
whose unknown~$u (t,x)$ stands for a population density. More precisely, the
environment consists of two patches moving with a constant climate shift speed
$c \geq 0$: in the invading patch $\{ t >0 , \, x \in \R \, | \ x < ct \}$ the
growth rate is negative and, in the receding patch $\{ t >0 , \, x \in \R \, |
\ x \geq ct \}$ it is of the classical monostable type. Our framework includes
species subject to a weak Allee effect, meaning that there may be a positive
correlation between population size and its per capita growth rate. We study
the large-time behaviour of solutions in the moving frame and show that whether
the population spreads or goes extinct depends not only on the speed $c$ but
also, in some intermediate speed range, on the initial datum. This is in sharp
contrast with the so-called `hair-trigger effect' in the homogeneous monostable
equation, and suggests that the size of the population becomes a decisive
factor under the joint influence of climate change and a weak Allee effect.
Furthermore, our analysis exhibit sharp thresholds between spreading and
extinction: in particular, we prove the existence of a threshold shifting speed
which depends on the initial population, such that spreading occurs at lower
speeds and extinction occurs at faster speeds.

H\""older exponent of $\theta_k$ or the Hausdorff dimension $\dim_\mathrm{H}

to include and to construct a path going through these intermediates in such a

numerical approach presented here, intermediate minima are constructed by
heredity transformations of known minimum energy structures and by identifying
local minima in minimum energy paths calculated using a modified version of the

fulfils important key requirements for for in-vivo applications, such as
biocompability, mechanical flexibility, as well as ease of high density

investigate the transistor's transconductance and intrinsic electronic noise
which are key parameters for the device sensitivity, confirming that the
obtained values are comparable to those of rigid graphene SGFETs. Furthermore,
we show that the devices do not degrade during repeated bending and the
transconductance, governed by the electronic properties of graphene, is
unaffected by bending. After cell culture, we demonstrate the recording of cell
action potentials from cardiomyocyte-like cells with a high signal-to-noise
ratio that is higher or comparable to competing state of the art technologies.
Our results highlight the great capabilities of flexible graphene SGFETs in
bioelectronics, providing a solid foundation for in-vivo experiments and,

within a number of steps. Current capturability analysis is based on stance leg
dynamics, without taking adequate consideration on swing leg. In this paper, we
combine capturability-based analysis with swing leg dynamics. We first
associate original definition of capturability with a time-margin, which
encodes a time sequence that can capture the robot. This time-margin
capturability requires consideration of swing leg, and we therefore introduce a
swing leg kernel that acts as a bridge between step time and step length. We
analyze N-step capturability with a combined model of swing leg kernels and a
linear inverted pendulum model. By analyzing swing leg kernels with different
parameters, we find that more powerful actuation and longer normalized step
length result in greater capturability. We also answer the question whether
more steps would give greater capturability. For a given disturbance, we find a
step sequence that minimizes actuation. This step sequence is whether a step
time sequence or a step length sequence, and this classification is based on

alpha particles is thoroughly assessed for two variants of an ITER baseline
scenario, which differ significantly in their core and pedestal temperatures. A
systematic approach is used that considers all possible eigenmodes for a given
magnetic equilibrium and determines their growth rates due to alpha-particle
drive and Landau damping on fuel ions, helium ashes and electrons. This
extensive stability study is efficiently conducted through the use of a
specialized workflow that profits from the performance of the hybrid MHD
drift-kinetic code $\mbox{CASTOR-K}$ (Borba D. and Kerner W. 1999 J. Comput.
Phys. ${\bf 153}$ 101; Nabais F. ${\it et\,al}$ 2015 Plasma Sci. Technol. ${\bf

largest growth-rates occur in the scenario variant with higher core
temperatures, which has the highest alpha-particle density and density
gradient, for eigenmodes with toroidal mode numbers $n\approx30$. Although
these eigenmodes suffer significant radiative damping, which is also evaluated,
their growth rates remain larger than those of the most unstable eigenmodes

observed between 2013 April 17-23 during fast SW. ISON produced an extended
parabolic X-ray morphology consistent with a collisionally thick coma, while
PanSTARRS demonstrated only a diffuse X-ray-emitting region. We consider these
emissions to be from charge exchange (CX) and model each comet's emission
spectrum from first principles accordingly. Our model agrees with the
observational spectra and also generates composition ratios for heavy, highly
charged SW ions interacting with the cometary atmosphere. We compare our
derived SW ion compositions to observational data and find a strong agreement
between them. These results further demonstrate the utility of CX emissions as
a remote diagnostics tool of both astrophysical plasma interaction and SW
composition. In addition, we observe potential soft X-ray emissions via ACIS
around 0.2 keV from both comets that are correlated in intensity to the hard
X-ray emissions between 0.4-1.0 keV. We fit our CX model to these emissions,
but our lack of a unique solution at low energies makes it impossible to
conclude if they are cometary CX in origin. We lastly discuss probable emission
mechanism sources for the soft X-rays and explore new opportunities these
findings present in understanding cometary emission processes via Chandra.

trigonometric parallaxes and Baade-Wesselink techniques. Our analysis suggests
that a mild overshooting and/or a moderate mass loss can affect
intermediate-mass stellar evolution in this cluster and gives a distance

applications given that it needs to be solved whenever we have to combine

We argue that this independence assumption is unreasonable and instead target a
bipartite matching between the two datafiles as our parameter of interest.
Bayesian implementations allow us to quantify uncertainty on the matching
decisions and derive a variety of point estimators using different loss
functions. We propose partial Bayes estimates that allow uncertain parts of the
bipartite matching to be left unresolved. We evaluate our approach to record
linkage using a variety of challenging scenarios and show that it outperforms
the traditional methodology. We illustrate the advantages of our methods

equation in two or three dimensional spaces by using polynomials of reduced
order is introduced and analyzed. The WG method is on the use of weak functions
and their weak derivatives defined as distributions. Weak functions and weak
derivatives can be approximated by polynomials with various degrees. Different
combination of polynomial spaces leads to different WG finite element methods,
which makes WG methods highly flexible and efficient in practical computation.
This paper explores the possibility of optimal combination of polynomial spaces
that minimize the number of unknowns in the numerical scheme, yet without
compromising the accuracy of the numerical approximation. Error estimates of
optimal order are established for the corresponding WG approximations in both a
discrete $H^2$ norm and the standard $L^2$ norm. In addition, the paper also

The numerical results show a great promise of the robustness, reliability,

flows. Previous estimates of the energy dissipation rate of the Smagorinsky
model for shear flows reflect a blow up of model energy dissipation as Re
increases. This blow up is consistent with the numerical evidence and leads to
the question: Is the over dissipation due to the influence of the turbulent
viscosity in boundary layers alone or is its action on small scales generated
by the nonlinearity through the cascade also a contributor? This report
develops model dissipation estimates for body force driven flow under periodic
boundary conditions (and thus only with nonlinearity generated small scales).
It is proven that the model's time averaged energy dissipation rate satisfies
the same upper bound as for the NSE plus one additional term that vanishes
uniformly in the Reynolds number as the Smagorinsky length scale decreases.
Since this estimate is consistent with that observed for the NSE, it
establishes that, without boundary layers, the Smagorinsky model does not over
dissipate.

thermal gradient in presence of magnetic field. In the beginning of this
century, Nernst experiments on cuprates were analyzed assuming that: i) The
contribution of quasi-particles to the Nernst signal is negligible; and ii)
Gaussian superconducting fluctuations cannot produce a Nernst signal well above
the critical temperature. Both these assumptions were contradicted by
subsequent experiments. This paper reviews experiments documenting multiple
sources of a Nernst signal, which, according to the Brigman relation, measures
the flow of transverse entropy caused by a longitudinal particle flow. Along
the lines of Landauer's approach to transport phenomena, the magnitude of the
transverse magneto-thermoelectric response is linked to the quantum of
thermoelectric conductance and a number of material-dependent length scales:
the mean-free-path, the Fermi wavelength, the de Broglie thermal wavelength and
the superconducting coherence length. Extremely mobile quasi-particles in
dilute metals generate a widely-documented Nernst signal. Fluctuating Cooper
pairs in the normal state of superconductors have been found to produce a
detectable Nernst signal with an amplitude conform to the Gaussian theory,
first conceived by Ussishkin, Sondhi and Huse. In addition to these microscopic
sources, mobile Abrikosov vortices, mesoscopic objects carrying simultaneously
entropy and magnetic flux, can produce a sizeable Nernst response. Finally, in
metals subject to a magnetic field strong enough to truncate the Fermi surface
to a few Landau tubes, each exiting tube generates a peak in the Nernst
response. The survey of these well-established sources of the Nernst signal is
a helpful guide to identify the origin of the Nernst signal in other
controversial cases.

in a liquid that surrounds a bubble with a free boundary and in a semi-infinite

evaporation, i. e. the bubble growth. A singularity exists at the point of the
triple (liquid-vapor-solid) contact. At high system pressure the bubble is
assumed to grow slowly, its shape being defined by the surface tension and the
vapor recoil force, a force coming from the liquid evaporating into the bubble.
It is shown that at some typical time the dry spot under the bubble begins to
grow rapidly under the action of the vapor recoil. Such a bubble can eventually
spread into a vapor film that can separate the liquid from the heater, thus

close it is to its native structure, using no other information than the
structure of the model has been shown to be useful for structure prediction.
The state of the art method, ProQ2, is based on a machine learning approach
that uses a number of features calculated from a protein model. Here, we
examine if these features can be exchanged with energy terms calculated from
Rosetta and if a combination of these terms can improve the quality assessment.
Results: When using the full atom energy function from Rosetta in ProQRosFA the
QA is on par with our previous state-of-the-art method, ProQ2. The method based
on the low-resolution centroid scoring function, ProQRosCen, performs almost as
well and the combination of all the three methods, ProQ2, ProQRosFA and
ProQCenFA into ProQ3 show superior performance over ProQ2. Availability: ProQ3

energy operator. The conservation law is proved and the probability continuity
equation is deducted in a general sense. Examples with a Hermitian kinetic
energy operator include the standard Schrodinger equation, the relativistic
Schrodinger equation, the fractional Schrodinger equation, the Dirac equation,
and the deformed Schrodinger equation. We reveal that the Klein-Gordon equation
has a hidden non-Hermitian kinetic energy operator. The probability continuity
equation with sources indicates that there exists a different way of
probability transportation, which is probability teleportation. An average
formula is deducted from the relativistic Schrodinger equation, the Dirac
equation, and the K-G equation.

hydrogen gas bubble surrounded by liquid hydrogen confined in a
semi-transparent spherical shell of 3 mm internal diameter. Such shells are
used as targets for the inertial confinement fusion (ICF), for which a
homogeneous (within a few percent) layer of a hydrogen isotope should be
deposited on the internal walls of the shells. The gravity does not allow the
hydrogen layer thickness to be homogeneous. To compensate this gravity effect,
we have used a non-homogeneous magnetic field created by a 10 T superconductive
solenoid. Our experiments show that the magnetic levitation homogenizes the
thickness of liquid hydrogen layer. However, the variation of the layer
thickness is very difficult to measure experimentally. Our theoretical model
allows the exact shape of the layer to be predicted. The model takes into
account the surface tension, gravity, van der Waals, and magnetic forces. The
numerical calculation shows that the homogeneity of the layer thickness is
satisfactory for the ICF purposes.

economics and financial markets. In this paper a similar approach is made from
a different perspective, trying to model the limit order book and price
formation process of a given stock by the Grand-Canonical Gibbs Ensemble for
the bid and ask processes. As a consequence we can define in a meaningful way
expressions for the temperatures of the ensembles of bid orders and of ask
orders, which are a function of maximum bid, minimum ask and closure prices of
the stock as well as of the exchanged volume of shares. It is demonstrated that
the difference between the ask and bid orders temperatures can be related to
the VAO (Volume Accumulation Oscillator) indicator, empirically defined in
Technical Analysis of stock markets. Furthermore the distributions for bid and
ask orders derived by the theory can be subject to well defined validations
against real data, giving a falsifiable character to the model.
