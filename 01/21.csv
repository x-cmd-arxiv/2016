calculations. We start from Euclidean current-current correlator and extract
$\sigma (\omega)$ from Green-Kubo relations using Backus-Gilbert method.
Calculations were performed both for long-range interactions and taking into
account only contact term. In both cases we vary interaction strength and study
its influence on optical conductivity. We compare our results with previous
theoretical calculations choosing $\omega \approx \kappa$ thus working in the
region of the plateau in $\sigma(\omega)$ which corresponds to optical
conductivity of Dirac quasiparticles. No dependence of optical conductivity on
interaction strength is observed unless we approach antiferromagnetic phase
transition in case of artificially enhanced contact term. Our results strongly
support previous theoretical studies claimed very weak regularization of
graphene conductivity.

equation of the discrete KP hierarchy, the Hirota-Miwa equation. We write the
Wronskian determinant solutions to the Hirota-Miwa equation and consider a
particular form of matrix integrals, which we show is an example of those
Wronskian solutions. The argument is then generalized to the whole hierarchy. A
similar strategy is used for the Pfaffianized version of the hierarchy except
that in that case, the solutions are written in terms of Pfaffians rather than

non-uniform spin-orbit interaction (SOI). Various sources of disorder, such as
disorder in semiconductor nanowire, bulk superconductor and
semiconductor-superconductor interface, are included to characterize their
effects on the stability of the topological phase. In the case of multiband
semiconducting nanowires, the phase diagram of the system as a function of the
chemical potential and magnetic field have been calculated. In two-band wire or
two coupled single band wire, the phase of one band can be controlled through
the other band, and these properties is critical to build multiband quantum
device. When the SOI vector or magnetic field in semiconductor nanowire rapidly
rotates by the angle $\pi $, changes its sign, a topological $\pi $ junction
forms at the junction between two wire sections characterized by different
directions of the SOI vectors or magnetic field. In this case, some fermionic
bound states (FBS) can emerge inside the proximity gap, which localize at the
topological $\pi $ junction, and coexist with Majorana bound states localized
at the nanowire ends. Changing the position of the topological $\pi $ junction
from one end to the other, the zero-energy FBS moves and can be used as
mediator to transfer quantum information between two distance MFs. Meanwhile,
the Andreev spectrum of the junction is qualitatively phase shift by $\pi $
compared to usual Majorana weak links. The FBS can act as quasiparticle traps
and serve as an effective mediator of hybridization between two distant
Majorana bound states (MBSs).

have been based on two ecological properties: dynamical stability and
feasibility. The former is typically regarded as the capacity of a community to
return to an original equilibrium state after a perturbation in species
abundances, and is usually linked to the strength of interspecific
interactions. The latter is the capacity to sustain positive abundances on all
its constituent species, and is linked to both interspecific interactions and
species demographic characteristics. Over the last 40 years, theoretical
research in ecology has emphasized the search for conditions leading to the
dynamical stability of ecological communities, while the conditions leading to
feasibility have been overlooked. However, thus far, we have no evidence of
whether species interactions are more conditioned by the community's need to be
stable or feasible. Here, we introduce novel quantitative methods and use
empirical data to investigate the consequences of species interactions on the
dynamical stability and feasibility of mutualistic communities. First, we
demonstrate that the more nested the species interactions in a community are,
the lower the mutualistic strength that the community can tolerate without
losing dynamical stability. Second, we show that high feasibility in a
community can be reached either with high mutualistic strength or with highly
nested species interactions. Third, we find that during the assembly process of
a seasonal pollinator community located at The Zackenberg Research Station (NE
Greenland), a high feasibility is reached through the nested species
interactions established between newcomer and resident species. Our findings
imply that nested mutualistic communities promote feasibility over stability,
which may suggest that the former can be key for community persistence.

sample allows a percent or even sub-percent level determination of the Higgs
boson couplings. With GEANT4-based full simulation and dedicated fast

across the NGVS field at distances between 25 and 40~kpc, with a density
maximum at $\simeq$~35~kpc. No evidence is found for new substructures beyond
the Sagittarius stream, at least out to a distance of $\sim$~90 kpc --- the
largest distance to which we can reliably trace the halo using MSTO stars. We
find clear evidence for a distance gradient in the Sagittarius stream across

the resulting system using suitable numerical schemes. In particular, by
replacing the $\eth$ and $\bar{\eth}$ operators either by a finite difference

in terms of spin-weighted spherical harmonics, the evolutionary equations may
be put into the form of a coupled system of non-linear ordinary differential

anisotropic escape mechanism, not of the hydrodynamic flow nature, and where
mass splitting is also observed. We demonstrate that the $v_2$ mass splitting
in AMPT is small right after hadronization (especially when resonance decays
are included); the mass splitting mainly comes from hadronic rescatterings,
even though their contribution to the overall charged hadron $v_2$ is small.
These findings are qualitatively the same as those from hybrid models that
combine hydrodynamics with a hadron cascade. We further show that there is no
qualitative difference between heavy ion collisions and small system

method is called isoAdvector, and is developed for general meshes consisting of
arbitrary polyhedral cells. The algorithm is based on the volume of fluid (VOF)
idea of calculating the volume of one of the fluids transported across the mesh
faces during a time step. The novelty of the isoAdvector concept consists in
two parts: First, we exploit an isosurface concept for modelling the interface
inside cells in a geometric surface reconstruction step. Second, from the
reconstructed surface, we model the motion of the face-interface intersection
line for a general polygonal face to obtain the time evolution within a time
step of the submerged face area. Integrating this submerged area over the time
step leads to an accurate estimate for the total volume of fluid transported
across the face. The method was tested on simple 2D and 3D interface advection
problems both on structured and unstructured meshes. The results are very
satisfactory both in terms of volume conservation, boundedness, surface
sharpness, and efficiency. The isoAdvector method was implemented as an
OpenFOAM(R) extension and is published as open source.

models are central to detection of such systems and subsequent parameter

recent waveform models for binary black holes with aligned spins, utilizing a
new set of $84$ high-accuracy numerical relativity simulations. Our analysis
covers comparable mass binaries ($1\le m_1/m_2\le 3$), and samples
independently both black hole spins up to dimensionless spin-magnitude of $0.9$
for equal-mass binaries and $0.85$ for unequal mass binaries. Furthermore, we
focus on the high-mass regime (total mass $\gtrsim 50M_\odot$). The two most
recent waveform models considered (PhenomD and SEOBNRv2) both perform very well
for signal detection, losing less than 0.5\% of the recoverable signal-to-noise
ratio $\rho$, except that SEOBNRv2's efficiency drops mildly for both black
hole spins aligned with large magnitude. For parameter estimation, modeling
inaccuracies of SEOBNRv2 are found to be smaller than systematic uncertainties
for moderately strong GW events up to roughly $\rho\lesssim 15$. PhenomD's
modeling errors are found to be smaller than SEOBNRv2's, and are generally
irrelevant for $\rho\lesssim 20$. Both models' accuracy deteriorates with
increased mass-ratio, and when at least one black hole spin is large and
aligned. The SEOBNRv2 model shows a pronounced disagreement with the numerical
relativity simulation in the merger phase, for unequal masses and
simultaneously both black hole spins very large and aligned. Two older waveform
models (PhenomC and SEOBNRv1) are found to be distinctly less accurate than the
more recent PhenomD and SEOBNRv2 models. Finally, we quantify the bias expected
from all GW models during parameter estimation for recovery of binary's masses
and spins.

variations in the Sun's radiant energy incident on the Earth may exacerbate (or
mitigate) the more dominant warming in recent centuries due to increasing
concentrations of greenhouse gases. We investigate potential impacts of the new
Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (SILSO) sunspot-number time
series on model reconstructions of TSI. In contemporary TSI records, variations
on time scales longer than about a day are dominated by the opposing effects of
sunspot darkening and facular brightening. These two surface magnetic features,
retrieved either from direct observations or from solar activity proxies, are
combined in TSI models to reproduce the current TSI observational record.
Indices that manifest solar-surface magnetic activity, in particular the
sunspot-number record, then enable the reconstruction of historical TSI.
Revisions to the sunspot-number record therefore affect the magnitude and
temporal structure of TSI variability on centennial time scales according to
the model reconstruction methodologies. We estimate the effects of the new
SILSO record on two widely used TSI reconstructions, namely the NRLTSI2 and the
SATIRE models. We find that the SILSO record has little effect on either model
after 1885 but leads to greater amplitude solar-cycle fluctuations in TSI
reconstructions prior, suggesting many 18th and 19th century cycles could be
similar in amplitude to those of the current Modern Maximum. TSI records based
on the revised sunspot data do not suggest a significant change in Maunder
Minimum TSI values, and comparing that era to the present we find only very
small potential differences in estimated solar contributions to climate with
this new sunspot record.

appreciably by the inclusion of baryons, increasing the speed of dark matter
particles compared to dark matter-only simulations. The gravitational potential
due to the presence of a baryonic disk increases the amount of high velocity
dark matter, resulting in velocity distributions which are more similar to the
Maxwellian Standard Halo Model than predicted from dark matter-only
simulations. Further, the velocity structures present in baryonic simulations
possess a greater diversity than expected from dark matter-only simulation. We
show the impact on the direct detection experiments LUX, DAMA/Libra, and CoGeNT

mass within the Milky Way's estimated mass range impact the results. A
Maxwellian fit to the velocity distribution tends to overpredict the amount of

overly optimistic direct detection bounds on models which are dependent on this
region of phase space for an experimental signal. Our work further demonstrates
that it is critical to transform simulated velocity distributions to the lab
frame of reference, due to the fact that velocity structure in the Solar
neighborhood appears when baryons are included. There is more velocity
structure present when baryons are included than in dark matter-only
simulations. Even when baryons are included, the importance of the velocity
structure is not as apparent in the Galactic frame of reference as in the Earth
frame.

model many complex systems, and can be mathematically described by {\em random}
networks. Understanding how patterns of activity arise in such systems is
important for understanding many natural phenomena. The emergence of patterns
of activity on complex networks with reaction-diffusion dynamics on the nodes
is studied here. The connection between solutions with a single activated node,
which can bifurcate from an undifferentiated state, and the fully developed
system-scale patterns are investigated computationally. The different
coexisting patterns of activity the network can exhibit are shown to be
connected via a snaking type bifurcation structure, similar to those
responsible for organising localised pattern formation in regular lattices.
These results reveal the origin of the multistable patterns found in systems
organised on complex networks. A key role is found to be played by nodes with
so called {\em optimal degree}, on which the interaction between the reaction
kinetics and the network structure organise the behaviour of the system. A
statistical representation of the density of solutions over the parameter space
is used as a means to answer important questions about the number of accessible
states that can be exhibited in systems with such a high degree of complexity.

equivalent to General Relativity supplemented by a fluid with a small positive

be a promising candidate for the Dark Matter. Despite these advantages, the
unavoidable presence of the strong coupling obscures the implementation of the

these datasets, new problems have appeared and some methods have been proposed
to solve these problems by selecting efficient features. Feature selection is a
problem of finding efficient features among all features in which the final
feature set can improve accuracy and reduce complexity. One way to solve this
problem is to evaluate all possible feature subsets. However, evaluating all
possible feature subsets is an exhaustive search and thus it has high
computational complexity. Until now many heuristic algorithms have been studied
for solving this problem. Hyper-heuristic is a new heuristic approach which can
search the solution space effectively by applying local searches appropriately.
Each local search is a neighborhood searching algorithm. Since each region of
the solution space can have its own characteristics, it should be chosen an
appropriate local search and apply it to current solution. This task is tackled
to a supervisor. The supervisor chooses a local search based on the functional
history of local searches. By doing this task, it can trade of between
exploitation and exploration. Since the existing heuristic cannot trade of
between exploration and exploitation appropriately, the solution space has not
been searched appropriately in these methods and thus they have low convergence
rate. For the first time, in this paper use a hyper-heuristic approach to find
an efficient feature subset. In the proposed method, genetic algorithm is used
as a supervisor and 16 heuristic algorithms are used as local searches.
Empirical study of the proposed method on several commonly used data sets from
UCI data sets indicates that it outperforms recent existing methods in the
literature for feature selection.

lensing observables with increasingly complex lens models to quantify biases
and uncertainties associated with different ways of treating the lens
environment (ENV) and LOS. We identify the combination of mass, projected
offset, and redshift that determines the importance of a perturbing galaxy for
lensing. Foreground structures have a stronger effect on the lens potential
than background structures, due to nonlinear effects in the foreground and
downweighting in the background. There is dramatic variation in the net
strength of ENV/LOS effects across different lens fields; modeling fields
individually yields stronger priors for $H_0$ than ray tracing through $N$-body
simulations. Models that ignore mass outside the lens yield poor fits and
biased results. Adding external shear can account for tidal stretching from
galaxies at redshifts $z \ge z_{\rm lens}$, but it requires corrections for
external convergence and cannot reproduce nonlinear effects from foreground
galaxies. Using the tidal approximation is reasonable for most perturbers as
long as nonlinear redshift effects are included. Even then, the scatter in
$H_0$ is limited by the lens profile degeneracy. Asymmetric image
configurations produced by highly elliptical lens galaxies are less sensitive
to the lens profile degeneracy, so they offer appealing targets for precision

models convolved with the bands of the ALHAMBRA survey, and the redshifted
position of the Balmer jump to select star-forming galaxies in the redshift
range 0.5 < z < 1.5. These galaxies are dubbed Balmer jump Galaxies BJGs. We
apply the iSEDfit Bayesian approach to fit each detailed SED and determine
star-formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, age and absolute magnitudes. The mass
of the haloes where these samples reside are found via a clustering analysis.
Five volume-limited BJG sub-samples with different mean redshifts are found to
reside in haloes of median masses $\sim 10^{12.5 \pm 0.2} M_\odot$ slightly
increasing toward z=0.5. This increment is similar to numerical simulations
results which suggests that we are tracing the evolution of an evolving
population of haloes as they grow to reach a mass of $\sim 10^{12.7 \pm 0.1}
M_\odot$ at z=0.5. The likely progenitors of our samples at z$\sim$3 are Lyman
Break Galaxies, which at z$\sim$2 would evolve into star-forming BzK galaxies,
and their descendants in the local Universe are elliptical galaxies.Hence, this
allows us to follow the putative evolution of the SFR, stellar mass and age of
these galaxies. From z$\sim$1.0 to z$\sim$0.5, the stellar mass of the volume
limited BJG samples nearly does not change with redshift, suggesting that major
mergers play a minor role on the evolution of these galaxies. The SFR evolution
accounts for the small variations of stellar mass, suggesting that star
formation and possible minor mergers are the main channels of mass assembly.

presence of dark energy. This result is based on the assumption that the
look-back time evolution of SN Ia luminosity, after light-curve corrections,
would be negligible. Recent studies show, however, that the Hubble residual
(HR) of SN Ia is correlated with the mass and morphology of host galaxies,
implying the possible dependence of SN Ia luminosity on host galaxy properties.
In order to investigate this more directly, we have initiated spectroscopic
survey for the early-type host galaxies, for which population age and
metallicity can be more reliably determined from the absorption lines. As the
first paper of the series, here we present the results from high
signal-to-noise ratio (>100 per pixel) spectra for 27 nearby host galaxies in
the southern hemisphere. For the first time in host galaxy studies, we find a
significant (~3.9sigma) correlation between host galaxy mass (velocity
dispersion) and population age, which is consistent with the ""downsizing"" trend
among non-host early-type galaxies. This result is rather insensitive to the
choice of population synthesis models. Since we find no correlation with
metallicity, our result suggests that stellar population age is mainly
responsible for the relation between host mass and HR. If confirmed, this would
imply that the luminosity evolution plays a major role in the systematic
uncertainties of SN Ia cosmology.

estimate the spectral auroral radio intensity of RGHJs based on the empirical

optimizing the ramp-up and ramp-down time scales, which is of direct practical
relevance for on-going experimental realizations.

theoretic ideas with an accurate quantum-mechanical description of reality to
give a more accurate and complete theory with new and more powerful
possibilities for information processing. The goal of both classical and
quantum information theory is to quantify the optimal rates of interconversion
of different resources. These rates are usually characterized in terms of
entropies. However, nonadditivity of many entropic formulas often makes finding
answers to information theoretic questions intractable. In a few auspicious
cases, such as the classical capacity of a classical channel, the capacity
region of a multiple access channel and the entanglement assisted capacity of a
quantum channel, additivity allows a full characterization of optimal rates.
Here we present a new mathematical property of entropic formulas, uniform
additivity, that is both easily evaluated and rich enough to capture all known
quantum additive formulas. We give a complete characterization of uniformly
additive functions using the linear programming approach to entropy
inequalities. In addition to all known quantum formulas, we find a new and
intriguing additive quantity: the completely coherent information. We also
uncover a remarkable coincidence---the classical and quantum uniformly additive
functions are identical; the tractable answers in classical and quantum
information theory are formally equivalent. Our techniques pave the way for a
deeper understanding of the tractability of information theory, from classical
multi-user problems like broadcast channels to the evaluation of quantum

that the orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects cluster not only in argument of

positions and orbital planes of the objects are tightly confined and that such
a clustering has only a probability of 0.007% to be due to chance, thus
requiring a dynamical origin. We find that the observed orbital alignment can
be maintained by a distant eccentric planet with mass greater than ~10 Earth
masses, whose orbit lies in approximately the same plane as those of the
distant Kuiper belt objects, but whose perihelion is 180 degrees away from the
perihelia of the minor bodies. In addition to accounting for the observed

of high semimajor axis objects with inclinations between 60 and 150 degrees

tool for the molecular sciences. RE simulations involve the concurrent
execution of independent simulations which infrequently interact and exchange
information. The next set of simulation parameters are based upon the outcome
of the exchanges.
  Typically RE functionality is integrated into the molecular simulation
software package. A primary motivation of the tight integration of RE
functionality with simulation codes has been performance. This is limiting at
multiple levels. First, advances in the RE methodology are tied to the
molecular simulation code. Consequently these advances remain confined to the
molecular simulation code for which they were developed. Second, it is
difficult to extend or experiment with novel RE algorithms, since expertise in
the molecular simulation code is typically required.
  In this paper, we propose the RepEx framework which address these
aforementioned shortcomings of existing approaches, while striking the balance
between flexibility (any RE scheme) and scalability (tens of thousands of
replicas) over a diverse range of platforms. RepEx is designed to use a
pilot-job based runtime system and support diverse RE Patterns and Execution
Modes. RE Patterns are concerned with synchronization mechanisms in RE
simulation, and Execution Modes with spatial and temporal mapping of workload
to the CPU cores. We discuss how the design and implementation yield the
following primary contributions of the RepEx framework: (i) its ability to
support different RE schemes independent of molecular simulation codes, (ii)
provide the ability to execute different exchange schemes and replica counts
independent of the specific availability of resources, (iii) provide a runtime
system that has first-class support for task-level parallelism, and (iv)

e.g. imposing stringent relationships between the kernels of the one- and
two-body problems, which must be preserved in any veracious treatment of mesons
as bound-states. In this connection, one may view the dressed gluon-quark
vertex, $\Gamma_\mu^a$, as fundamental. We use a novel representation of
$\Gamma_\mu^a$, in terms of the gluon-quark scattering matrix, to develop a
method capable of elucidating the unique quark-antiquark Bethe-Salpeter kernel,
$K$, that is symmetry-consistent with a given quark gap equation. A strength of
the scheme is its ability to expose and capitalise on graphic symmetries within
the kernels. This is displayed in an analysis that reveals the origin of
$H$-diagrams in $K$, which are two-particle-irreducible contributions,
generated as two-loop diagrams involving the three-gluon vertex, that cannot be
absorbed as a dressing of $\Gamma_\mu^a$ in a Bethe-Salpeter kernel nor
expressed as a member of the class of crossed-box diagrams. Thus, there are no
general circumstances under which the WGT identities essential for a valid
description of mesons can be preserved by a Bethe-Salpeter kernel obtained
simply by dressing both gluon-quark vertices in a ladder-like truncation; and,
moreover, adding any number of similarly-dressed crossed-box diagrams cannot
improve the situation.

The value of $c_s$ is determined by the rate of bend of the inflationary path

respect an inequality that involves the curvature tensor of the Kahler manifold
underlying supergravity, and the ratio $M/H$ between the mass $M$ of

allow for suppressed values of $c_s$ (values smaller than $c_s \sim 0.4$)

of mass $M$ affect the propagation of curvature perturbations by inducing on

associated with a competing instability, the properties of the condensate
crucially depend on the time-reversal behavior of the order parameter of the

examples of turbine arrays present solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations to
illustrate the feasibility of flow manipulation, and motivate an idealized
model. Using inviscid fluid dynamics, we underscore the relation between bound
vorticity and flow deflection, and between free vorticity and energy
extraction. To understand and design flow manipulations that increase the
kinetic energy incident on the turbines, we consider an idealized
deflector-turbine array constrained to a line segment, acting as an internal
flow-boundary. We impose profiles of bound and shed vorticity on this segment

analyze the resulting flow using inviscid fluid dynamics. We find that the
power extracted by the array is the product of two components: (i) the
deflected kinetic energy incident on the array, and (ii) the array efficiency,
both of which vary with deflection strength. The array efficiency, or its
ability to extract a fraction of the incident energy, decreases slightly with
increasing deflection from about 57\% at weak deflection to 39\% at high
deflection. This decrease is outweighed by increasing incident kinetic energy
with deflection, resulting in monotonically improved power extraction, thus

An external time-dependent potential is then applied. The ensuing density
fluctuations are recorded to calculate the density response. This method was
previously used by Kwong and Bonitz for studying plasma oscillations in a
correlated electron gas. The energy-weighted sum-rule for the response function
is guaranteed by using conserving self-energy insertions as the method then
generates the full vertex-functions. These can alternatively be calculated by
solving a Bethe -Salpeter equation as done in some previous works. The (first
order) mean field is derived from a momentum-dependent (non-local) interaction
while $2^{nd}$ order self-energies are calculated using a particle-hole
two-body effective (or 'residual') interaction given by a gaussian \it local
\rm potential. We present numerical results for the response function
$S(\omega,q_0)$ for $q_0=0.2,0.4$ and $0.8 {\rm fm}^{-1}$. Comparison is made
with the nucleons being un-correlated i.e. with only the first order mean field
included, the 'HF+RPA' approximation. We briefly discuss the relation of our
work with the Landau quasi-particle theory as applied to nuclear systems by
Sj\""oberg and followers using methods developped by Babu and Brown, with
special emphasis on the 'induced' interaction.

contain X-ray dominated regions. X-rays interact with the dust and gas present

been performed on ices, X-ray irradiation experiments on bare cosmic dust
analogs have been scarce up to now. Our goal is to study the effects of hard
X-rays on cosmic dust analogs via in-situ X-ray diffraction. By using a hard
X-ray synchrotron nanobeam, we seek to simulate cumulative X-ray exposure on
dust grains during their lifetime in these astrophysical environments, and
provide an upper limit on the effect of hard X-rays on dust grain structure.
  We prepared enstatite nanograins, analogs to cosmic silicates, via the
melting-quenching technique. These amorphous grains were then annealed to
obtain polycrystalline grains. These were characterized via scanning electron
microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy before
irradiation. Powder samples were prepared in X-ray transparent substrates and
were irradiated with hard X-rays nanobeams (29.4 keV) provided by beamline
ID16B of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. X-ray diffraction images
were recorded in transmission mode. We detected the amorphization of
polycrystalline silicates embedded in an organic matrix after an accumulated
X-ray exposure of 6.4 x 10$^{27}$ eV cm$^{-2}$. Pure crystalline silicate
grains (without resin) did not exhibit amorphization. None of the amorphous
silicate samples (pure and embedded in resin) underwent crystallization. We
analyzed the evolution of the polycrystalline sample embedded in an organic
matrix as a function of X-ray exposure. Loss of diffraction peak intensity,
peak broadening, and the disappearance of discrete spots and arcs, revealed the
amorphization of the resin embedded (originally polycrystalline) silicate
sample.

between mathematical and graphical representations and the effect of
scaffolding on students' performance. We gave a typical problem that can be
solved using Gauss's law involving a spherically symmetric charge distribution
(a conducting sphere concentric with a conducting spherical shell) to 95
calculus-based introductory physics students. We asked students to write a
mathematical expression for the electric field in various regions and asked
them to graph the electric field. We knew from previous experience that
students have great difficulty in graphing the electric field. Therefore, we
implemented two scaffolding interventions to help them. Students who received
the scaffolding support were either (1) asked to plot the electric field in
each region first (before having to plot it as a function of distance from the
center of the sphere) or (2) asked to plot the electric field in each region
after explicitly evaluating the electric field at the beginning, mid and end
points of each region. The comparison group was only asked to plot the electric
field at the end of the problem. We found that students benefited the most from
intervention (1) and that intervention (2), although intended to aid students,
had an adverse effect. Also, recorded interviews were conducted with a few
students in order to understand how students were impacted by the
aforementioned interventions.

proposed approach, effectively subsampled quadratures involves sparsely
subsampling an existing tensor grid using QR column pivoting. For polynomial
interpolation using hyperbolic or total order sets, we then solve the following
square least squares problem. For polynomial approximation, we use a column
pruning heuristic that removes columns based on the highest total orders and
then solves the tall least squares problem. While we provide bounds on the
condition number of such tall submatrices, it is difficult to ascertain how
column pruning effects solution accuracy as this is problem specific. We
conclude with numerical experiments on an analytical function and a model
piston problem that show the efficacy of our approach compared with randomized
subsampling. We also show an example where this method fails.

central massive black hole can be fully or partially disrupted by the black
hole tidal field, lighting up the compact object via gas accretion. This
phenomenon can repeat if the star, not fully disrupted, is on a closed orbit.
Because of the multiplicity of stars in binary systems, also binary stars may
experience in pairs such a fate, immediately after being tidally separated. The
consumption of both the binary components by the black hole is expected to
power a double-peaked flare. In this paper, we perform for the first time, with
GADGET2, a suite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of binary stars
around a galactic central black hole in the Newtonian regime. We show that
accretion luminosity light curves from double tidal disruptions reveal a more
prominent knee, rather than a double peak, when decreasing the impact parameter
of the encounter and when elevating the difference between the mass of the star
which leaves the system after binary separation and the mass of the companion.
The detection of a knee can anticipate the onset of periodic accretion
luminosity flares if one of the stars, only partially disrupted, remains bound
to the black hole after binary separation. Thus knees could be precursors of
periodic flares, which can then be predicted, followed up and better modelled.
Analytical estimates in the black hole mass range $10^5-10^8 \rm M_{\rm \odot}$
show that the knee signature is enhanced in the case of black holes of mass
$10^6-10^7 \rm M_{\rm \odot}$.

algorithm, Moser and Tardos developed the so-called entropy compression method.
It turned out that one could obtain better combinatorial results by a direct
application of the entropy compression method rather than simply appealing to
the LLL. The aim of this paper is to provide a generalization of the LLL which
implies these new combinatorial results. This generalization, which we call the
Local Cut Lemma, concerns a random cut in a directed graph with certain
properties. Note that our result has a short probabilistic proof that does not
use entropy compression. As a consequence, it not only shows that a certain
probability is positive, but also gives an explicit lower bound for this

lower bound on the number of edges in color-critical hypergraphs) as well as
explain how to use the Local Cut Lemma to derive some of the results obtained

with the required stringency, primarily due to usability issues. Initial
deployment did not reveal the problems of passwords, deep and profound flaws
only emerged once passwords were deployed in the wild. The need for a
replacement is widely acknowledged yet despite over a decade of research into
knowledge-based alternatives, few, if any, have been adopted by industry.
Alternatives are unconvincing for three primary reasons. The first is that
alternatives are rarely investigated beyond the initial proposal, with only the
results from a constrained lab test provided to convince adopters of their
viability. The second is that alternatives are seldom tested realistically
where the authenticator mediates access to something of value. The third is
that the testing rarely varies the device or context beyond that initially
targeted. In the modern world different devices are used across a variety of
contexts. What works well in one context may easily fail in another.
Consequently, the contribution of this paper is an ""in the wild"" evaluation of
an alternative authentication mechanism that had demonstrated promise in its
lab evaluation. In the field test the mechanism was deployed to actual users to
regulate access to an application in a context beyond that initially proposed.
The performance of the mechanism is reported and discussed. We conclude by
reflecting on the value of field evaluations of alternative authentication
mechanisms.

fixing the coefficients to theoretical values can give rise to important
systematic errors which directly impact the physical properties of the system
derived from such lightcurves such as the planetary radius. However, studies of
the effect of limb darkening assumptions on the retrieved parameters have
mostly focused on the widely used quadratic limb-darkening law, leaving out
other proposed laws that are either simpler or better descriptions of model
intensity profiles. In this work, we show that laws such as the logarithmic,
square-root and three-parameter law do a better job than the quadratic and
linear laws when deriving parameters from transit lightcurves, both in terms of
bias and precision, for a wide range of situations. We therefore recommend to
study which law to use on a case-by-case basis. We provide code to guide the
decision of when to use each of these laws and select the optimal one in a
mean-square error sense, which we note has a dependence on both stellar and

gap opening (or closing) takes place for some type of jagged graphene
nanoribbons in the external electric field that lays in the plane of the

determining stellar fundamental parameters. In previous works,
$\chi^2$-minimization method is usually used to find the best matching model to
characterize observations. In this letter, we adopt the $\chi^2$-minimization
method but only using the observed high-precision oscillation to constrain
theoretical models for solar-like oscillating star KIC 6225718, which is
observed by \kepler\ satellite. We also take into account the influence of
model precision. Finally, we find that the time resolution of stellar evolution
can not be ignored in high-precision asteroseismic analysis. Based on this, we
find the acoustic radius $\tau_{0}$ is the only global parameter that can be
accurately measured by $\chi^2_{\nu}$ matching method between observed
frequencies and theoretical model calculations. We obtain
$\tau_{0}=4601.5^{+4.4}_{-8.3}$ seconds. In addition, we analyze the
distribution of $\chi^2_{\nu}$-minimization models (CMMs), and find that the
distribution range of CMMs is slightly enlarged by some extreme cases, which
possess both of larger mass and higher (or lower) heavy element abundance, at
lower acoustic radius end.

CO$_2$ laser to melt Er:Yb glass onto silica microcapillaries or fibres. This
is realised by the fact that the two glasses have different melting points. The
CO$_2$ laser power is controlled to flow the doped glass around the silica
cylinder. In the case of a capillary, the resulting geometry is a hollow,
microbottle-shaped resonator. This is a simple method for fabricating a number
of glass WGM lasers with a wide range of sizes on a single, micron-scale
structure. The Er:Yb doped glass outer layer is pumped at 980 nm via a tapered
optical fibre and whispering gallery mode (WGM) lasing is recorded around 1535
nm. This structure facilitates a new way to thermo-optically tune the
microlaser modes by passing gas through the capillary. The cooling effect of
the gas flow shifts the WGMs towards shorter wavelengths, thus thermal tuning
of the lasing modes over 70 GHz is achieved. Results are fitted using the
theory of hot wire anemometry, allowing the flow rate to be calibrated with a
flow sensitivity as high as 100 GHz/sccm. Strain tuning of the microlaser modes
by up to 50 GHz is also demonstrated.

produce a global ranking that represents the social preference. Rank-breaking
is a common practice to reduce the computational complexity of learning the

comparisons. However, due to the ignored dependencies in the data, naive
rank-breaking approaches can result in inconsistent estimates. The key idea to
produce accurate and consistent estimates is to treat the pairwise comparisons
unequally, depending on the topology of the collected data. In this paper, we
provide the optimal rank-breaking estimator, which not only achieves
consistency but also achieves the best error bound. This allows us to
characterize the fundamental tradeoff between accuracy and complexity. Further,
the analysis identifies how the accuracy depends on the spectral gap of a

understand how the quenching of star formation is linked to galaxy structure.
For these less dust-attenuated galaxies, NUV-r is found to be linearly
correlated with Dn4000, supporting that NUV-r is a good photometric indicator
of stellar age (or specific star formation rate). We find that: (1) At
M*<10^{10.2}M_{\sun}, the central NUV-r is on average only~ 0.25 mag redder
than the outer NUV-r. The intrinsic value would be even smaller after
accounting for dust correction. However, the central NUV-r becomes
systematically much redder than the outer NUV-r for more massive galaxies at

  This has several important consequences. For one thing, it implies that the

upper semi-continuous function of the map in the $\C^1$ topology. Another
consequence is that the sets of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with

prediction using protein network data and have been shown to outperform
neighborhood- and module-based methods. Recent studies have shown that
integrating the hierarchical structure of the Gene Ontology (GO) data
dramatically improves prediction accuracy. However, previous methods usually
either used the GO hierarchy to refine the prediction results of multiple
classifiers, or flattened the hierarchy into a function-function similarity
kernel. No study has taken the GO hierarchy into account together with the
protein network as a two-layer network model.
  We first construct a Bi-relational graph (Birg) model comprised of both
protein-protein association and function-function hierarchical networks. We
then propose two diffusion-based methods, BirgRank and AptRank, both of which
use PageRank to diffuse information on this two-layer graph model. BirgRank is
an application of traditional PageRank with fixed decay parameters. In
contrast, AptRank uses an adaptive mechanism to improve the performance of
BirgRank. We evaluate both methods in predicting protein function on yeast,
fly, and human datasets, and compare with four previous methods: GeneMANIA,
TMC, ProteinRank and clusDCA. We design three validation strategies: missing
function prediction, de novo function prediction, and guided function
prediction to comprehensively evaluate all six methods. We find that both
BirgRank and AptRank outperform the others, especially in missing function
prediction when using only 10% of the data for training.
  AptRank combines protein-protein associations and the GO function-function
hierarchy into a two-layer network model without flattening the hierarchy into
a similarity kernel. Introducing an adaptive mechanism to the traditional,
fixed-parameter model of PageRank greatly improves the accuracy of protein
function prediction.

is fully turbulent because of MRI. However, in the range, r_{out} (= 8 - 60 AU)
from the central star, MRI is suppressed around the midplane of the gas disk
and a quiet area without turbulence appears, because the degree of ionization
of gas becomes low enough. The disk becomes fully turbulent again in the range
r in (= 0.2 - 1 AU), which is called the inner turbulent region, because the
midplane temperature become high enough (\gt 1000 K) due to gravitational
energy release.
  Planetesimals are formed through gravitational instability at the two
distinct sites, outer and inner MRI fronts (the boundaries between the MRI
suppressed region (MSR) and the outer and inner turbulent regions), because of
the radial concentration of the solid particles. At the outer MRI front, icy
particles grow through low-velocity collisions into porous aggregates with low
densities. They eventually undergo gravitational instability to form icy
planetesimals. On the other hand, rocky particles accumulate at the inner MRI
front, since their drift velocities turn outward due to the local maximum in
gas pressure. They undergo gravitational instability in a sub-disk of pebbles
to form rocky planetesimals at the inner MRI front.
  The tandem regime is consistent with the ABEL model, in which the Earth was
initially formed as a completely volatile-free planet. The water and other
volatile elements came later through the accretion of icy particles by the
occasional scatterings in the outer regions.

datasets, and 7 multi-person datasets. The detailed information and analysis of
these datasets is a useful resource in guiding insightful selection of datasets

systematically study thermal and spin excitations of a generalized
Kitaev-Heisenberg model studied by Chaloupka $et$ $al$. in Phys. Rev. Lett.
110, 097204 (2013) and an effective ab initio Hamiltonian for Na$_2$IrO$_3$
proposed by Yamaji $et$ $al$. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 107201 (2014), by
employing a numerical diagonalization method. We reveal that closeness to the
Kitaev's QSL is characterized by the following properties, besides trivial
criteria such as reduction of magnetic ordered moments and Neel temperatures:
(1) Two peaks in the temperature dependence of specific heat at $T_{\ell}$ and
$T_h$ caused by the fractionalization of spin to two types of Majorana
fermions. (2) In between the double peak, prominent plateau or shoulder pinned
at $(R/2)\ln 2$ in the temperature dependence of entropy, where $R$ is the gas
constant. (3) Failure of the linear spin wave approximation at the low-lying
excitations of dynamical structure factors. (4) Small ratio $T_{\ell}/T_h$
close to or less than 0.03. According to the proposed criteria, Na$_2$IrO$_3$
is categorized to a compound close to the Kitaev's QSL, and is proven to be a
promising candidate for the realization of the QSL if the relevant material
parameters can further be tuned by making thin film of Na$_2$IrO$_3$ on various
substrates or applying axial pressure perpendicular to the honeycomb networks
of iridium ions. Applications of these characterization to

the relative phase energies correctly for any reasonable description of

configuration space of invariant connections (traditional approach). We prove a
general classification theorem for such invariant connections, which we then
use to calculate the classical configuration space for the homogeneous and the
spherically symmetric case. Here, the backbone of the introduced reduction
concept is a lifting result for group actions on sets to spectra of
$C^*$-subalgebras of the bounded functions thereon; and as a further
application of this, we single out the standard kinematical Hilbert space of
homogeneous isotropic loop quantum cosmology by means of the same invariance
condition for both the standard configuration space
$\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{Bohr}}$, as well as for the Fleischhack one
$\mathbb{R}\sqcup\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{Bohr}}$. Along the way, symmetries of
embedded analytic curves under a given analytic Lie group action are
investigated, and a first classification result is proven for the case that the
action is proper or pointwise proper and transitive, and only admits normal
stabilizers.

together with the statistical data on international migration opened up
unprecedented opportunities for a study on global mobility. In this paper we
consider it from the perspective of a multi-layer complex network, built using
a combination of three datasets: Twitter, Flickr and official migration data.
Those datasets provide different but equally important insights on the global
mobility: while the first two highlight short-term visits of people from one
country to another, the last one - migration - shows the long-term mobility
perspective, when people relocate for good. And the main purpose of the paper
is to emphasize importance of this multi-layer approach capturing both aspects
of human mobility at the same time. So we start from a comparative study of the
network layers, comparing short- and long- term mobility through the
statistical properties of the corresponding networks, such as the parameters of
their degree centrality distributions or parameters of the corresponding
gravity model being fit to the network. We also focus on the differences in
country ranking by their short- and long-term attractiveness, discussing the
most noticeable outliers. Finally, we apply this multi-layered human mobility
network to infer the structure of the global society through a community
detection approach and demonstrate that consideration of mobility from a
multi-layer perspective can reveal important global spatial patterns in a way
more consistent with other available relevant sources of international
connections, in comparison to the spatial structure inferred from each network
layer taken separately.

safety and in particular, has a clear impact on the choice of speed limits.
Visibility distance is thus of importance for road engineers and authorities.
While visibility distance criteria are routinely taken into account in road
design, only a few systems exist for estimating it on existing road networks.
Most existing systems comprise a target vehicle followed at a constant distance
by an observer vehicle, which only allows to check if a given, fixed visibility
distance is available. We propose two new approaches that allow estimating the
maximum available visibility distance, involving only one vehicle and based on
different sensor technologies, namely binocular stereovision and 3D range
sensing (LIDAR). The first approach is based on the processing of two views
taken by digital cameras onboard the diagnostic vehicle. The main stages of the
process are: road segmentation, edge registration between the two views, road
profile 3D reconstruction and finally, maximal road visibility distance
estimation. The second approach involves the use of a Terrestrial LIDAR Mobile
Mapping System. The triangulated 3D model of the road and its surroundings
provided by the system is used to simulate targets at different distances,
which allows estimating the maximum geometric visibility distance along the
pathway. These approaches were developed in the context of the SARI-VIZIR
PREDIT project. Both approaches are described, evaluated and compared. Their
pros and cons with respect to vehicle following systems are also discussed.

focused on changes in the vocal tract shape in recorder playing techniques.
Measurements carried out with recorder players allow to identify techniques
involving changes of the mouth shape as well as consequences on the sound. A
second experiment performed in laboratory mimics the coupling with the vocal
tract on an artificial mouth. The phase of the transfer function between the
instrument and the mouth of the player is identified to be the relevant
parameter of the coupling. It is shown to have consequences on the spectral
content in terms of energy distribution among the even and odd harmonics, as
well as on the stability of the first two oscillating regimes. The results
gathered from the two experiments allow to develop a simplified model of sound
production including the effect of changing the vocal tract shape. It is based
on the modification of the jet instabilities due to the pulsating emerging jet.
Two kinds of instabilities, symmetric and anti-symmetric, with respect to the
stream axis, are controlled by the coupling with the vocal tract and the
acoustic oscillation within the pipe, respectively. The symmetry properties of
the flow are mapped on the temporal formulation of the source term, predicting
a change in the even / odd harmonics energy distribution. The predictions are
in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.

variable system, a shortcut to the adiabatic transport of a trapped ion in the
phase space. The resulting dynamics is equivalent to a ""fast-motion video"" of
the adiabatic trajectory. The robustness of this protocol is shown to surpass
that of competing schemes based on classical local controls and Fourier
optimization methods. Our results demonstrate that shortcuts to adiabaticity
provide a robust speedup of quantum protocols of wide applicability in quantum
technologies.

Earth-trailing blob. Our results suggest that the size of the smooth cloud, a
dominant component in the model, is by about 10% more compact than previously
thought, and that the dust sizes are not large enough to emit blackbody

We
describe two techniques: our first technique gives sample-optimal testers,
while our second technique gives matching sample lower bounds. As a
consequence, we resolve the sample complexity of a wide variety of testing
problems.
  Our upper bounds are obtained via a modular reduction-based approach. Our
approach yields optimal testers for numerous problems by using a standard
$\ell_2$-identity tester as a black-box. Using this recipe, we obtain simple
estimators for a wide range of problems, encompassing most problems previously
studied in the TCS literature, namely: (1) identity testing to a fixed
distribution, (2) closeness testing between two unknown distributions (with
equal/unequal sample sizes), (3) independence testing (in any number of
dimensions), (4) closeness testing for collections of distributions, and (5)
testing histograms. For all of these problems, our testers are sample-optimal,
up to constant factors. With the exception of (1), ours are the {\em first
sample-optimal testers for the corresponding problems.} Moreover, our
estimators are significantly simpler to state and analyze compared to previous
results.
  As an application of our reduction-based technique, we obtain the first {\em
nearly instance-optimal} algorithm for testing equivalence between two {\em
unknown} distributions. Moreover, our technique naturally generalizes to other
metrics beyond the $\ell_1$-distance.
  Our lower bounds are obtained via a direct information-theoretic approach:
Given a candidate hard instance, our proof proceeds by bounding the mutual
information between appropriate random variables. While this is a classical
method in information theory, prior to our work, it had not been used in
distribution property testing.

designed to provide companionship to a person. The senior population are facing
a special demand for companionship. Artificial companion agents have been
demonstrated to be useful in therapy, offering emotional companionship and
facilitating socialization. However, there is lack of empirical studies on what
the artificial agents should do and how they can communicate with human beings
better. To address these functional research problems, we attempt to establish
a model to guide artificial companion designers to meet the emotional needs of
the elderly through fulfilling absent roles in their social interactions. We
call this model the Role Fulfilling Model. This model aims to use role as a key
concept to analyse the demands from the elderly for functionalities from an
emotional perspective in artificial companion agent designs and technologies.
To evaluate the effectiveness of this model, we proposed a serious game
platform named Happily Aging in Place. This game will help us to involve a
large scale of senior users through crowdsourcing to test our model and
hypothesis.
  To improve the emotional communication between artificial companion agents
and users, This book draft addresses an important but largely overlooked aspect
of affective computing: how to enable companion agents to express mixed
emotions with facial expressions? And furthermore, for different users, do
individual heterogeneity affects the perception of the same facial expressions?
Some preliminary results about gender differences have been found. The
perception of facial expressions between different age groups or cultural
backgrounds will be held in future study.

The outer bounds match the inner bounds in the infinite-energy limit, thereby
establishing the unconstrained capacity region for such channels. Our result

cooler (T$_{\rm kin}$=60K) than the eastern shell but somewhat hotter than the

that at lower (sub-)millimeter frequencies, exhibiting a spectral index

largely optically thin emission. However, our fits suggest a second (more
optically thick) dust component at higher temperatures (T$_{\rm d}$>60K),

interacting neurons subject to independent Brownian noise. The propagation of
chaos property means that in the large network size limit, the neurons behave
as if they are probabilistically independent. The model for the internal
dynamics of the neurons is taken to be that of Wilson and Cowan, and we
consider there to be multiple different populations. The synaptic connections
are modelled with a nonlinear `electrical' model. The nonlinearity of the
synaptic connections means that our model lies outside the scope of classical
propagation of chaos results. We obtain the propagation of chaos result by
taking advantage of the fact that the mean-field equations are Gaussian, which
allows us to use Borell's Inequality to prove that its tails decay
exponentially.

were resolved. Strong coherent dipole-dipole coupling between excitons and LSPR
in resonant condition manifests as an electromagnetically induced transparency
window in the extinction spectra of the localized surface plasmon. In this
strong coupling regime a new quasi-particle, known as a plexciton, is expected
to exhibit distinct properties, which exist in neither of the original

quantum state transformation is given systematically for the first time. The
concept of amplification of quantum states is defined specifically and the
amplification of a set of quantum states is formulated generally as the
transformation of quantum states. Three different kinds of important quantum
amplifications, i.e., deterministic noisy quantum amplification, probabilistic
noiseless quantum amplification, and deterministic noiseless quantum
amplification are identified and discussed. For deterministic quan- tum
amplification, the linearity of amplification is proven to be incompatible with
the noiseless amplification while it is not true for probabilistic quantum
amplification. However, deterministic noiseless quantum amplification is shown
physically attainable if the linearity of amplification is given up. The
connection between the gain of amplification and the successful probability is
discussed for probabilistic quantum amplification. Assuming that successful
probability is the same for all quantum states to be amplified, we obtain a
generally valid relation between the gain of amplication and the successful
probability. Particular interest is given to phase-preserving quantum
amplication of Gaussian states which has been shown of theoretical interest and
of practical importance in quantum information and quantum communication
recently. Our results of quantum state amplification not only enrich the
research of quantum amplification but also can be helpful for further practical
applications.

determine the physically relevant domain of rapidly rotating neutron stars,
which is delimited by the set of neutron stars rotating at the Kepler limit,
the set of neutron stars along the secular instability line, and the set of
static neutron stars. As compared to Einstein gravity, the presence of the
Gauss-Bonnet term decreases this domain, leading to lower values for the
maximum mass as well as to smaller central densities. The quadrupole moment is
decreased by the Gauss-Bonnet term for rapidly rotating neutron stars, while it
is increased for slowly rotating neutron stars. The universal relation between
the quadrupole moment and the moment of inertia found in General Relativity
appears to extend to dilatonic Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with very little
dependence on the coupling strength of the Gauss-Bonnet term. The neutron stars
carry a small dilaton charge.

permutations. An important consequence of this is that GOSPA allows us to
penalize localization errors for detected targets and the errors due to missed

recently for iterative computation over big graphs. These systems provide a
user-friendly vertex-centric programming interface, where a programmer only
needs to specify the behavior of one generic vertex when developing a parallel
graph algorithm. However, most existing systems require the input graph to
reside in memories of the machines in a cluster, and the few out-of-core
systems suffer from problems such as poor efficiency for sparse computation
workload, high demand on network bandwidth, and expensive cost incurred by
external-memory join and group-by.
  In this paper, we introduce the GraphD system for a user to process very
large graphs with ordinary computing resources. GraphD fully overlaps
computation with communication, by streaming edges and messages on local disks,
while transmitting messages in parallel. For a broad class of Pregel algorithms
where message combiner is applicable, GraphD eliminates the need of any
expensive external-memory join or group-by. These key techniques allow GraphD
to achieve comparable performance to in-memory Pregel-like systems without
keeping edges and messages in memories. We prove that to process a graph G=(V,
E) with n machines using GraphD, each machine only requires O(|V|/n) memory
space, allowing GraphD to scale to very large graphs with a small cluster.
Extensive experiments show that GraphD beats existing out-of-core systems by
orders of magnitude, and achieves comparable performance to in-memory systems
running with enough memories.

that random directed graphs with constant edge-establishing probability are
typically strongly connected, i.e. any ordered pair of vertices is connected by
a directed path. This typical topological property of directed random graphs is
exploited to demonstrate universal features of the asymptotic evolution of
large random qubit networks. These results are independent of our knowledge of

at most $r$ other code symbols. The well-known Singleton-like bound says that
$d \le n-k-\lceil k/r\rceil +2$ and an LRC is said to be optimal if it attains

useful structural properties on $q$-ary optimal LRCs are obtained. We derive an
upper bound on the minimum distance of $q$-ary optimal $(n,k,r)$-LRCs in terms
of the field size $q$. Then, we focus on constructions of optimal LRCs over

related quantity known as the flatness factor, has been recently shown to be
important for lattice code design in various wireless communication setups.
However, the theta series is in general not known in closed form, excluding a
small set of very special lattices. In this article, motivated by the practical
applications as well as the mathematical problem itself, a simple approximation
of the theta series of a lattice is derived. A rigorous analysis of its
accuracy is provided.
  In relation to this, maximum-likelihood decoding in the context of
compute-and-forward relaying is studied. Following previous work, it is shown
that the related metric can exhibit a flat behavior, which can be characterized
by the flatness factor of the decoding function. Contrary to common belief, we
note that the decoding metric can be rewritten as a sum over a random lattice
only when at most two sources are considered. Using a particular matrix
decomposition, a link between the random lattice and the code lattice employed
at the transmitter is established, which leads to an explicit criterion for
code design, in contrast to implicit criteria derived previously. Finally,
candidate lattices are examined with respect to the proposed criterion using
the derived theta series approximation.

directly detect the resonance-driven spin-current using Au/permalloy (Py,

thermal light curve of Pluto-Charon is observed in all filters, albeit more
marginally at 160 and especially 500 $\mu$m. Putting these data into the
context of older ISO, Spitzer and ground-based observations indicates that the
brightness temperature (T$_B$) of the system (rescaled to a common heliocentric
distance) drastically decreases with increasing wavelength, from $\sim$53 K at
20 $\mu$m to $\sim$35 K at 500 $\mu$m, and perhaps ever less at longer
wavelengths. Considering a variety of diurnal and/or seasonal thermophysical
models, we show that T$_B$ values of 35 K are lower than any expected
temperature for the dayside surface or subsurface of Pluto and Charon, implying
a low surface emissivity. Based on multiterrain modeling, we infer a spectral
emissivity that decreases steadily from 1 at 20-25 $\mu$m to $\sim$0.7 at
500~$\mu$m. This kind of behavior is usually not observed in asteroids (when
proper allowance is made for subsurface sounding), but is found in several icy

strong dielectric constant and a considerable surface material transparency

  Firstly, we train a $37$-class convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect
all characters in an image, which results in a high recall, compared with
conventional approaches such as training a binary text/non-text classifier.
False positives are then eliminated by the second plate/non-plate CNN
classifier. Bounding box refinement is then carried out based on the edge
information of the license plates, in order to improve the
intersection-over-union (IoU) ratio. The proposed cascade framework extracts
license plates effectively with both high recall and precision. Last, we
propose to recognize the license characters as a {sequence labelling} problem.
A recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) is trained
to recognize the sequential features extracted from the whole license plate via
CNNs. The main advantage of this approach is that it is segmentation free. By
exploring context information and avoiding errors caused by segmentation, the
RNN method performs better than a baseline method of combining segmentation and

representation in the CFT, even inside a small black hole at late times, which
leads to a simple CFT description of infalling geodesics. This means classical
infalling observers will experience the classical geometry in the interior. The
outgoing piece of the field is more subtle. In an eternal two-sided geometry it
can be represented as an operator on the left CFT. In a stable one-sided
geometry it can be described using entanglement via the PR construction. But in
an evaporating black hole trans-horizon entanglement breaks down at the Page

  Manifolds","Submitting to ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data with
  minor revision",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As a significant subspace clustering method, low rank representation (LRR)
has attracted great attention in recent years. To further improve the
performance of LRR and extend its applications, there are several issues to be
resolved. The nuclear norm in LRR does not sufficiently use the prior knowledge
of the rank which is known in many practical problems. The LRR is designed for
vectorial data from linear spaces, thus not suitable for high dimensional data
with intrinsic non-linear manifold structure. This paper proposes an extended
LRR model for manifold-valued Grassmann data which incorporates prior knowledge
by minimizing partial sum of singular values instead of the nuclear norm,
namely Partial Sum minimization of Singular Values Representation (GPSSVR). The
new model not only enforces the global structure of data in low rank, but also
retains important information by minimizing only smaller singular values. To
further maintain the local structures among Grassmann points, we also integrate
the Laplacian penalty with GPSSVR. An effective algorithm is proposed to solve
the optimization problem based on the GPSSVR model. The proposed model and
algorithms are assessed on some widely used human action video datasets and a
real scenery dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed methods
obviously outperform other state-of-the-art methods.

difficulties exploring multimodal distributions. We propose the
repelling-attracting Metropolis (RAM) algorithm that maintains the
simple-to-implement nature of the Metropolis algorithm, but is more likely to
jump between modes. The RAM algorithm is a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a
proposal that consists of a downhill move in density that aims to make local
modes repelling, followed by an uphill move in density that aims to make local
modes attracting. The downhill move is achieved via a reciprocal Metropolis
ratio so that the algorithm prefers downward movement. The uphill move does the
opposite using the standard Metropolis ratio which prefers upward movement.
This down-up movement in density increases the probability of a proposed move
to a different mode. Because the acceptance probability of the proposal
involves a ratio of intractable integrals, we introduce an auxiliary variable
which creates a term in the acceptance probability that cancels with the
intractable ratio. Using several examples, we demonstrate the potential for the
RAM algorithm to explore a multimodal distribution more efficiently than a

reference frames corresponds to a reversal of the phase velocity. Yet from the
point of view of the relation $E=\hbar\omega$, a positive quantum of energy
apparently becomes a negative energy one. This is physically distinct from a
change in the sign of the wave-vector, and has been associated with various
effects such as Cherenkov radiation, quantum friction, and the Hawking effect.
In this work we provide a more detailed understanding of these negative
frequency modes based on a simple microscopic model of a dielectric medium as a
lattice of scatterers. We calculate the classical and quantum mechanical
radiation damping of an oscillator moving through such a lattice and find that
the modes where the frequency has changed sign contribute negatively. In terms
of the lattice of scatterers we find that this negative radiation damping
arises due to phase of the periodic force experienced by the oscillator due to
the relative motion of the lattice.

multiple-output (MIMO) systems with uniform linear antenna arrays. It is known
that the maximum spatial degrees of freedom is achieved by spacing antenna
elements at half the carrier wavelength. The purpose of this paper is to
investigate the impacts of spacing antennas more densely than the critical
separation. The achievable rates of MIMO systems are evaluated in the
large-system limit, where the lengths of transmit and receive antenna arrays
tend to infinity with the antenna separations kept constant. The main results
are twofold: One is that, under a mild assumption of channel instances, spacing
antennas densely cannot improve the capacity of MIMO systems normalized by the
spatial degrees of freedom. The other is that the normalized achievable rate of
quadrature phase-shift keying converges to the normalized capacity achieved by
optimal Gaussian signaling, as the transmit antenna separation tends to zero
after taking the large-system limit. The latter result is based on mathematical
similarity between MIMO transmission and faster-than-Nyquist signaling in

subsequently brought to the stellar surface by convection. Two neutron sources,
activated at distinct temperatures, have been proposed: 13C and 22Ne, each
releasing one neutron per alpha-particle (4He) captured. To explain the
measured stellar abundances, stellar evolution models invoking the 13C neutron
source (which operates at temperatures of about one hundred million kelvin) are
favoured. Isotopic ratios in primitive meteorites, however, reflecting
nucleosynthesis in the previous generations of stars that contributed material
to the Solar System, point to higher temperatures (more than three hundred
million kelvin), requiring at least a late activation of 22Ne. Here we report a
determination of the s-process temperature directly in evolved low-mass giant
stars, using zirconium and niobium abundances, independently of stellar
evolution models. The derived temperature supports 13C as the s-process neutron

classes at segmental level as the essential and invariant representations used
in speech temporal organization. In the context of speech processing, a deep
neural network (DNN) is an effective computational method to infer the
probability of individual phonological classes from a short segment of speech
signal. A vector of all phonological class probabilities is referred to as
phonological posterior. There are only very few classes comprising a short term
speech signal; hence, the phonological posterior is a sparse vector. Although
the phonological posteriors are estimated at segmental level, we claim that
they convey supra-segmental information. Specifically, we demonstrate that
phonological posteriors are indicative of syllabic and prosodic events.
Building on findings from converging linguistic evidence on the gestural model
of Articulatory Phonology as well as the neural basis of speech perception, we
hypothesize that phonological posteriors convey properties of linguistic
classes at multiple time scales, and this information is embedded in their
support (index) of active coefficients. To verify this hypothesis, we obtain a
binary representation of phonological posteriors at the segmental level which
is referred to as first-order sparsity structure; the high-order structures are
obtained by the concatenation of first-order binary vectors. It is then
confirmed that the classification of supra-segmental linguistic events, the
problem known as linguistic parsing, can be achieved with high accuracy using
asimple binary pattern matching of first-order or high-order structures.

observations of sunlight scattered off the bright asteroid 4/Vesta, from which
we deduced the Sun's activity-driven RV variations. In parallel, the HMI
instrument onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory provided us with simultaneous
high spatial resolution magnetograms, Dopplergrams, and continuum images of the
Sun in the Fe I 6173A line. We determine the RV modulation arising from the
suppression of granular blueshift in magnetised regions and the flux imbalance
induced by dark spots and bright faculae. The rms velocity amplitudes of these
contributions are 2.40 m/s and 0.41 m/s, respectively, which confirms that the
inhibition of convection is the dominant source of activity-induced RV
variations at play, in accordance with previous studies. We find the Doppler
imbalances of spot and plage regions to be only weakly anticorrelated.
Lightcurves can thus only give incomplete predictions of convective blueshift
suppression. We must instead seek proxies that track the plage coverage on the
visible stellar hemisphere directly. The chromospheric flux index R'_HK derived
from the HARPS spectra performs poorly in this respect, possibly because of the
differences in limb brightening/darkening in the chromosphere and photosphere.
We also find that the activity-driven RV variations of the Sun are strongly
correlated with its full-disc magnetic flux density, which may become a useful
proxy for activity-related RV noise.

Friedmann model has Newtonian analogy, its use to infer distances has
instructive similarities to classical dynamical distance indicators. In view of
the theoretical exact linear distance-velocity law, we emphasize that it is

redshift (primarily observed) --> space expansion velocity (not directly

on the readout weight representations. The crux of the work is to equip the
autoencoder with a loss function that correctly interprets the reconstructed
readout weights by associating them with a reconstruction error measured in the
data space of sequences. This essentially amounts to measuring the predictive
performance that the reconstructed readout weights exhibit on their
corresponding sequences when plugged back into the echo state network with the

can deal both with real valued sequences as well as binary sequences. We derive

and urban planners. Their definition turns on whether or not larger cities and
regions are more efficient and more productive than smaller ones. We complement
existing discussion on agglomeration economies and the urban wage premium here
by providing a sensitivity analysis of estimated coefficients to different
delineations of urban agglomeration as well as to different definitions of the
economic measure that summarises the urban premium. This quantity can consist
of total wages measured at the place of work, or of income registered at the
place of residence. The chosen option influences the scaling behaviour of city
size as well as the spatial distribution of the phenomenon at the city level.
Spatial discrepancies between the distribution of jobs and the distribution of
households at different economic levels makes city definitions crucial to the
estimation of economic relations which vary with city size. We argue this point
by regressing measures of income and wage over about five thousands different
definitions of cities in France, based on our algorithmic aggregation of
administrative spatial units at regular cutoffs which reflect density,
population thresholds and commuting flows. We also go beyond aggregated
observations of wages and income by searching for evidence of larger
inequalities and economic segregation in the largest cities. This paper
therefore considers the spatial and economic complexity of cities with respect
to discussion about how we measure agglomeration economies. It provides a basis
for reflection on alternative ways to model the processes which lead to
observed variations, and this can provide insights for more comprehensive
regional planning.

29 June 2015 from New Zealand and Australia. This occurred only two weeks
before the NASA New Horizons flyby of the Pluto system and serves as a useful
comparison between ground-based and space results. We find that Pluto's
atmosphere is still expanding, with a significant pressure increase of
5$\pm$2\% since 2013 and a factor of almost three since 1988. This trend rules
out, as of today, an atmospheric collapse associated with Pluto's recession
from the Sun. A central flash, a rare occurrence, was observed from several
sites in New Zealand. The flash shape and amplitude are compatible with a
spherical and transparent atmospheric layer of roughly 3~km in thickness whose
base lies at about 4~km above Pluto's surface, and where an average thermal
gradient of about 5 K~km$^{-1}$ prevails. We discuss the possibility that small
departures between the observed and modeled flash are caused by local
topographic features (mountains) along Pluto's limb that block the stellar
light. Finally, using two possible temperature profiles, and extrapolating our
pressure profile from our deepest accessible level down to the surface, we
obtain a possible range of 11.9-13.7~$\mu$bar for the surface pressure.

as a mathematical model of Differential Analysers, that is to say as a model of
continuous-time analog (mechanical, and later one electronic) machines of that
time.
  Following Shannon's arguments, functions generated by GPACs must be
differentially algebraic. As it is known that some computable functions like
Euler's $\Gamma(x)=\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{x-1}e^{-t}dt$ or Riemann's Zeta function
$\zeta(x)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac1{k^x}$ are not differentially algebraic, this
argument has been often used to demonstrate in the past that the GPAC is less
powerful than digital computation.
  It was proved in JOC2007, that if a more modern notion of computation is
considered, i.e. in particular if computability is not restricted to real-time
generation of functions, the GPAC is actually equivalent to Turing machines.
  Our purpose is first to discuss the robustness of the notion of computation
involved in JOC2007, by establishing that natural variants of the notion of
computation from this paper leads to the same computability result.
  Second, to go considerations about (time) complexity, we explore several
natural variants for measuring time/space complexity of a computation.
  Rather surprisingly, whereas defining a robust time complexity for general
continuous time systems is a well known open problem, we prove that all
variants are actually equivalent even at the complexity level. As a
consequence, it seems that a robust and well defined notion of time complexity
exists for the GPAC, or equivalently for computations by polynomial ordinary
differential equations.
  Another side effect of our proof is also that we show in some way that
polynomial ordinary differential equations can be used as a kind of programming
model, and that there is a rather nice and robust notion of ODE programming.

categorization to optimally solve every one of its approximately $7.401 \times
10^{45}$ possible configurations. Rubik's Cube, Rubik's Revenge's predecessor
(3x3x3), with its approximately $4.33 \times 10^{19}$ possible configurations,
has only recently been completely solved by Rokicki et. al, further finding
that any configuration requires no more than 20 moves. With the sheer dimension
of Rubik's Revenge and its total configuration space, a brute-force method of
finding all optimal solutions would be in vain. Similar to the methods used by
Rokicki et. al on Rubik's Cube, in this paper we develop a method for solving
arbitrary configurations of Rubik's Revenge in phases, using a combination of a
powerful algorithm known as IDA* and a useful definition of distance in the
cube space. While time-series results were not successfully gathered, it will
be shown that this method far outweighs current human-solving methods and can
be used to determine loose upper bounds for the cube space. Discussion will
suggest that this method can also be applied to other puzzles with the proper
transformations.

a novel taxonomy, which classifies security metrics into four categories:
metrics for measuring the system vulnerabilities, metrics for measuring the
defenses, metrics for measuring the threats, and metrics for measuring the
situations. The insight underlying the taxonomy is that situations (or outcomes
of cyber attack-defense interactions) are caused by certain threats (or
attacks) against systems that have certain vulnerabilities (including human
factors) and employ certain defenses. In addition to systematically reviewing
the security metrics that have been proposed in the literature, we discuss the

of modern digital communications, is a special case of sampling in
shift-invariant spaces. Furthermore, it is well known that the Poisson
summation formula is equivalent to the sampling theorem and that the Zak
transform is closely connected to the sampling theorem and the Poisson
summation formula. These results have been known to hold in the Fourier
transform domain for decades and were recently shown to hold in the Fractional
Fourier transform domain by A. Bhandari and A. Zayed.
  The main goal of this article is to show that these results also hold true in
the SAFT domain. We provide a short, self-contained proof of Shannon's theorem
for functions bandlimited in the SAFT domain and then show that sampling in the
SAFT domain is equivalent to orthogonal projection of functions onto a subspace
of bandlimited basis associated with the SAFT domain. This interpretation of
sampling leads to least-squares optimal sampling theorem. Furthermore, we show
that this approximation procedure is linked with convolution and semi-discrete
convolution operators that are associated with the SAFT domain. We conclude the
article with an application of fractional delay filtering of SAFT bandlimited
functions.

sources known. Our LOFAR observations exploit a new and novel calibration
scheme to probe 10 times deeper than any previous study in this relatively
unexplored part of the spectrum. The LOFAR observations, when combined with
VLA, GMRT, and Chandra X-ray data, provide new information about the nature of
cluster merger shocks and their role in re-accelerating relativistic particles.
We derive a spectral index of $\alpha = -0.8 \pm 0.1$ at the northern edge of
the main radio relic, steepening towards the south to $\alpha \approx - 2$. The
spectral index of the radio halo is remarkably uniform ($\alpha = -1.16$, with
an intrinsic scatter of $\leq 0.04$). The observed radio relic spectral index
gives a Mach number of $\mathcal{M} = 2.8^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$, assuming diffusive
shock acceleration (DSA). However, the gas density jump at the northern edge of
the large radio relic implies a much weaker shock ($\mathcal{M} \approx 1.2$,
with an upper limit of $\mathcal{M} \approx 1.5$). The discrepancy between the
Mach numbers calculated from the radio and X-rays can be explained if either
(i) the relic traces a complex shock surface along the line of sight, or (ii)
if the radio relic emission is produced by a re-accelerated population of
fossil particles from a radio galaxy. Our results highlight the need for
additional theoretical work and numerical simulations of particle acceleration

tags, and this tends to ignore the personal and social aspect of tags,
especially on photoblogging websites such as Flickr. Previous work has
correctly identified that many of the tags that users provide on images are not
visually relevant (i.e. representative of the salient content in the image) and
they go on to treat such tags as noise, ignoring that the users chose to
provide those tags over others that could have been more visually relevant.
Another common assumption about user generated tags for images is that the
order of these tags provides no useful information for the prediction of tags
on future images. This assumption also tends to define usefulness in terms of
what is visually relevant to the image. For general tagging or labeling
applications that focus on providing visual information about image content,
these assumptions are reasonable, but when considering personalized image
tagging applications, these assumptions are at best too rigid, ignoring user
choice and preferences.
  We challenge the aforementioned assumptions, and provide a machine learning
approach to the problem of personalized image tagging with the following
contributions: 1.) We reformulate the personalized image tagging problem as a
search/retrieval ranking problem, 2.) We leverage the order of tags, which does
not always reflect visual relevance, provided by the user in the past as a cue
to their tag preferences, similar to click data, 3.) We propose a technique to
augment sparse user tag data (semi-supervision), and 4.) We demonstrate the
efficacy of our method on a subset of Flickr images, showing improvement over
previous state-of-art methods.

engine plays a very important role in determining the overall efficiency of
these engines. A good atomization process could help the fuel to mix with the
air properly leading to its efficient combustion, thereby reducing the emitted
pollutants as well. The recent trend followed by the engineers focused on
designing fuel injectors for more efficient atomization is to increase the
atomization pressure while decreasing the nozzle orifice diameter. A
consequence of this is the development of cavitation (formation of vapor
cavities or bubbles in the liquid) inside the injector close to the nozzle. The
main reason behind this is the sudden changes in the pressure inside the
injector and these cavities or bubbles are usually formed where the pressure is
relatively low.This work mainly focuses on studying the formation of cavitation
and its effect on the velocity of the spray in the near nozzle region using
asymmetrical transparent nozzle equipped with a needle lift sensor with nozzle
diameter of 0.35 mm at 300 bar of injection pressure. The experiment consists
in recording of several image-pairs, which are separated by about 300 ns,
capturing the dynamics of the spray, a few millimeters from the nozzle in the
direction of the flow. These image-pairs are then used to compute the velocity
from the displacement of the liquid structures and ligaments by correlating the
first image with the second. About 200 of such velocity graphs are then
averaged to obtain a velocity map and is compared with the similar average
velocity maps obtained at different times from the start of the injection. The
angular spread of the spray from each of these images is calculated as well.
The images showing cavitation inside the injector are also recorded at these
same instants of time so as to understand the effects of cavitation on the
velocity and angular spread of the spray close to the nozzle.
