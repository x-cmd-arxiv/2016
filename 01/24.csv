  Cryosphere",,"10.5194/tc-2015-209",,"physics.ao-ph physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been widely debated whether Arctic sea-ice loss can reach a tipping
point beyond which a large sea-ice area disappears abruptly. The theory of
dynamical systems predicts a slowing down when a system destabilises towards a
tipping point. In simple stochastic systems this can result in increasing
variance and autocorrelation, potentially yielding an early warning of an
abrupt change. Here we aim to establish whether the loss of Arctic sea ice
would follow these conceptual predictions, and which trends in sea ice
variability can be expected from pre-industrial conditions toward an Arctic
that is ice-free during the whole year. To this end, we apply a model hierarchy
consisting of two box models and one comprehensive Earth system model. We find
a consistent and robust decrease of the ice volume's annual relaxation time
before summer ice is lost because thinner ice can adjust more quickly to
perturbations. Thereafter, the relaxation time increases, mainly because the
system becomes dominated by the ocean water's large heat capacity when the
ice-free season becomes longer. Both trends carry over to the autocorrelation
of sea ice thickness in time series. These changes are robust to the nature and
origin of climate variability in the models and hardly depend on the balance of
feedbacks. Therefore, characteristic trends can be expected in the future. As
these trends are not specific to the existence of abrupt ice loss, the
prospects for early warnings seem very limited. This result also has
implications for statistical indicators in other systems whose effective mass
changes over time, affecting the trend of their relaxation time. However, the
robust relation between state and variability would allow an estimate of
sea-ice variability from only short observations. This could help one to
estimate the likelihood and persistence of extreme events in the future.

affects an outcome. Count or zero-inflated count outcome are common in many
studies in which mediation analysis is of interest. For example, in dental
studies, outcomes such as decayed, missing and filled teeth are typically zero
inflated. Existing mediation analysis approaches for count data assume
sequential ignorability of the mediator. This is often not plausible because
the mediator is not randomized so that there are unmeasured confounders
associated with the mediator and the outcome. In this paper, we develop causal
methods based on instrumental variable (IV) approaches for mediation analysis
for count data possibly with a lot of zeros that do not require the assumption
of sequential ignorability. We first define the direct and indirect effect
ratios for those data, and then propose estimating equations and use empirical
likelihood to estimate the direct and indirect effects consistently. A
sensitivity analysis is proposed for violations of the IV exclusion restriction
assumption. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method works well for
different types of outcomes under different settings. Our method is applied to
a randomized dental caries prevention trial and a study of the effect of a

derived which is valid for weakly interacting and strongly interacting bosons.
The transition line which separates the superfluid phase from Mott

$\langle\hat n\rangle=2$. For unit filling, our findings agree qualitatively
with Quantum Monte-Carlo results. Contrary to the well-known mean-field result,

operators live is assigned not for each Lorentzian metric $g$, but for each
causal structure ${\cal C}$. In practice one uses 'conformal frames' which all
provide equivalent descriptions of the same QFT. To put it differently, Quantum
Field Theories only know about causal structure of spacetime, and not its full
Lorentzian metric. The Weyl group and the local RG flow naturally arise when
one compares equivalent descriptions in different conformal frames. This is
reduced to the usual RG flow of coupling constants when one only compares
descriptions in conformal frames related by spacetime-independent Weyl
rescalings. We point out that in this picture minimal coupling of a QFT to the
metric is inconsistent and comment on the necessary violation of the
equivalence principle in the presence of scalars.

calculation of the mean magnetization time series within a small connected

the magnetization time series attains intermittent characteristics and the
probability density for consecutive values of mean magnetization within a
region around zero becomes a power law. Typically the size of this region is of
the order of the standard deviation of the magnetization. The emerging
power-law exponent is directly related to the isothermal critical exponent
$\delta$ through a simple analytical expression. We employ this method to

motivation for this is that constructing a maximal error-detecting code is a

input two positive integers $N,\ell$, a probability value \ff, and a
specification of the errors permitted in some application, and generates an
error-detecting, or error-correcting, block code having up to $N$ codewords of
length $\ell$. If the algorithm finds less than $N$ codewords, then those
codewords constitute a code that is \ff-maximal with high probability. The
error specification (also called channel) is modelled as a transducer, which
allows one to model any rational combination of substitution and
synchronization errors. We also present some elements of our implementation of
various error-detecting properties and their associated methods. Then, we show

presence of hot gas out to the galaxy cluster peripheries. We developed a
spectral imaging algorithm dedicated to the SZ observations of nearby galaxy
clusters with Planck, with the aim of revealing gas density anisotropies
related to the filamentary accretion of materials, or pressure discontinuities
induced by the propagation of shock fronts. To optimize an unavoidable
trade-off between angular resolution and precision of the SZ flux measurements,
the algorithm performs a multiscale analysis of the SZ maps as well as of other
extended components, such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies
and the Galactic thermal dust. The demixing of the SZ signal is tackled through
kernel weighted likelihood maximizations. The CMB anisotropies are further
analyzed through a wavelet analysis, while the Galactic foregrounds and SZ maps
are analyzed via a curvelet analysis that best preserves their anisotropic
details. The algorithm performance has been tested against mock observations of
galaxy clusters obtained by simulating the Planck High Frequency Instrument and
by pointing a few characteristic positions in the sky. These tests suggest that
Planck should easily allow us to detect filaments in the cluster peripheries
and detect large-scale shocks in colliding galaxy clusters that feature
favorable geometry.

They depend on both nuclear interaction parameters related to the equation of
state of infinite nuclear matter and on quantal shell effects, which are
strongly impacted by the presence of nuclear surface. In this work, by studying
the dependence of charge and neutron radii, and neutron skin, on nuclear matter
parameters, we assess different mechanisms that drive nuclear sizes. We apply
nuclear density functional theory using a family of Skyrme functionals obtained
by means of different optimization protocols targeting specific nuclear
properties. By performing the Monte-Carlo sampling of reasonable functionals
around the optimal parametrization, we study correlations between nuclear
matter paramaters and observables characterizing charge and neutron
distributions. We demonstrate the existence of the strong converse relation
between the nuclear charge radii and the saturation density of symmetric
nuclear matter and also between the neutron skins and the slope of the symmetry
energy. For functionals optimized to experimental binding energies only, proton
and neutron radii are weakly correlated due to canceling trends from different
nuclear matter parameters. We show that by requiring that the nuclear
functional reproduces the empirical saturation point of symmetric nuclear
matter practically fixes the charge (or proton) radii, and vice versa. The
neutron skin uncertainty primarily depends on the slope of the symmetry energy.
Consequently, imposing a constraint on both $\rho_0$ and $L$ practically
determines the nuclear size, modulo small variations due to shell effects.

hadronic spectrum, light-front wavefunctions, and the functional form of the
QCD running coupling in the nonperturbative domain using light-front holography
-- the duality between the front form and AdS$_5$, the space of isometries of
the conformal group. In addition, superconformal algebra leads to remarkable
supersymmetric relations between mesons and baryons of the same parity. The
mass scale $\kappa$ underlying confinement and hadron masses can be connected
to the parameter $\Lambda_{\overline {MS}}$ in the QCD running coupling by
matching the nonperturbative dynamics, as described by the effective conformal
theory mapped to the light-front and its embedding in AdS space, to the
perturbative QCD regime. The result is an effective coupling defined at all
momenta. This matching of the high and low momentum transfer regimes determines
a scale $Q_0$ which sets the interface between perturbative and nonperturbative
hadron dynamics. The use of $Q_0$ to resolve the factorization scale
uncertainty for structure functions and distribution amplitudes, in combination
with the principle of maximal conformality (PMC) for setting the
renormalization scales, can greatly improve the precision of perturbative QCD
predictions for collider phenomenology. The absence of vacuum excitations of
the front-form vacuum has important consequences for the cosmological constant.

applications can often tolerate occasional deadline violations without
substantially impacting their Quality of Service (QoS). A fundamental problem
in such systems is deciding how to allocate shared resources so as to meet
applications' QoS requirements. A simple framework to address this problem is
to, (1) dynamically prioritize users as a possibly complex function of their
deficits (difference of achieved vs required QoS), and (2) allocate resources
so to expedite users with higher priority. This paper focuses on a general
class of systems using such priority-based resource allocation. We first
characterize the set of feasible QoS requirements and show the optimality of
max weight-like prioritization. We then consider simple weighted Largest
Deficit First (w-LDF) prioritization policies, where users with higher weighted
QoS deficits are given higher priority. The paper gives an inner bound for the
feasible set under w-LDF policies, and, under an additional monotonicity
assumption, characterizes its geometry leading to a sufficient condition for
optimality. Additional insights on the efficiency ratio of w-LDF policies, the
optimality of hierarchical-LDF and characterization of clustering of failures
are also discussed.

  with Limited Samples","11 pages, 6 figures",,"10.1109/TSG.2016.2618623",,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The estimation of the conditional failure rate (CFR) of an overhead
transmission line (OTL) is essential for power system operational reliability
assessment. It is hard to predict the CFR precisely, although great efforts
have been made to improve the estimation accuracy. One significant difficulty
is the lack of available outage samples, due to which the law of large numbers
is no longer applicable and no convincing statistical result can be obtained.
To address this problem, in this paper a novel imprecise probabilistic approach
is proposed to estimate the CFR of an OTL. The imprecise Dirichlet model (IDM)
is applied to establish the imprecise probabilistic relation between a single
conditional variable and the failure rate of an OTL. Then a credal network is
constructed to integrate the IDM estimation results corresponding to different
conditional variables and infer the CFR. Instead of providing a single-valued
estimation result, the proposed approach predicts the possible interval of the
CFR in order to explicitly indicate the uncertainty of the estimation and more
objectively represent the available knowledge. The proposed approach is
illustrated by estimating the CFRs of two LGJ-300 transmission lines located in
the same region; the test results validate its effectiveness.

  Technology",,,,"cs.NI cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To achieve end-to-end delivery in intermittently connected networks, epidemic
routing is proposed for data delivery at the price of excessive buffer
occupancy due to its store-and-forward nature. The ultimate goal of epidemic
routing protocol design is to reduce system resource usage (e.g., buffer
occupancy) while simultaneously providing data delivery with statistical
guarantee. Therefore the tradeoffs between buffer occupancy and data delivery
reliability are of utmost importance. In this paper we investigate the
tradeoffs for two representative schemes: the global timeout scheme and the
antipacket dissemination scheme that are proposed for lossy and lossless data
delivery, respectively. For lossy data delivery, we show that with the
suggested global timeout value, the per-node buffer occupancy only depends on
the maximum tolerable packet loss rate and pairwise meeting rate. For lossless
data delivery, we show that the buffer occupancy can be significantly reduced
via fully antipacket dissemination. The developed tools therefore offer new
insights for epidemic routing protocol designs and performance evaluations.

agents communicate to form multiple clusters, with each cluster of agents
asymptotically converging to the same clustering point. We introduce in this
paper a special class of cluster consensus dynamics, termed the $G$-clustering
dynamics for $G$ a point group, whereby the autonomous agents can form as many
as $|G|$ clusters, and moreover, the associated $|G|$ clustering points exhibit
a geometric symmetry induced by the point group. The definition of a
$G$-clustering dynamics relies on the use of the so-called voltage graph. We
recall that a $G$-voltage graph is comprised of two elements---one is a
directed graph (digraph), and the other is a map assigning elements of a
group~$G$ to the edges of the digraph. For example, in the case when $G = \{1,
-1\}$, i.e., a cyclic group of order~$2$, a voltage graph is nothing but a
signed graph. A $G$-clustering dynamics can then be viewed as a generalization
of the so-called Altafini's model, which was originally defined over a signed
graph, by defining the dynamics over a voltage graph. One of the main
contributions of this paper is to identify a necessary and sufficient condition
for the exponential convergence of a $G$-clustering dynamics. Various
properties of voltage graphs that are necessary for establishing the
convergence result are also investigated, some of which might be of independent
interest in topological graph theory.

By
considering an inhomogeneous mean flow effect on turbulence, it is shown that
turbulent cross helicity (velocity--magnetic-field correlation) should enter
the expression of turbulent electromotive force as the coupling coefficient for
the mean absolute vorticity. The inclusion of the cross-helicity effect makes
the present model different from the current $\alpha$--$\Omega$-type models
mainly in two points. First, in addition to the usual $\alpha$ (helicity
effect) and $\beta$ (turbulent magnetic diffusivity), we consider the $\gamma$
coefficient (cross-helicity effect) as a key ingredient of the dynamo process.
Second, unlike the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ coefficients, which are often treated
as an adjustable parameter in the current studies, the spatiotemporal evolution
of $\gamma$ coefficient is solved simultaneously with the mean magnetic-field
equations. The basic scenario is as follows: In the presence of turbulent cross
helicity, the toroidal field is induced by the toroidal rotation in mediation
by the turbulent cross helicity. The $\alpha$ effect generates the poloidal
field from the toroidal one. This poloidal field produces a turbulent cross
helicity whose sign is opposite to the original one. Then a cycle of reversal
completes. Eigenvalue analyses of the simplest possible present model give a
butterfly diagram, which confirms the above scenario as well as the
equator-ward migrations, the phase relationship between the cross helicity and
magnetic fields, etc. These results suggest that the oscillation of the
turbulent cross helicity is a key for the activity cycle. The reversal of the
turbulent cross helicity is not the result of the magnetic-field reversal, but
the cause of the latter. This new model is expected to open up the possibility
of the mean-field or turbulence closure dynamo approaches.

  with Accesses","3 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern DRAM cells are periodically refreshed to prevent data loss due to
leakage. Commodity DDR DRAM refreshes cells at the rank level. This degrades
performance significantly because it prevents an entire rank from serving
memory requests while being refreshed. DRAM designed for mobile platforms,
LPDDR DRAM, supports an enhanced mode, called per-bank refresh, that refreshes
cells at the bank level. This enables a bank to be accessed while another in
the same rank is being refreshed, alleviating part of the negative performance
impact of refreshes. However, there are two shortcomings of per-bank refresh.
First, the per-bank refresh scheduling scheme does not exploit the full
potential of overlapping refreshes with accesses across banks because it
restricts the banks to be refreshed in a sequential round-robin order. Second,
accesses to a bank that is being refreshed have to wait.
  To mitigate the negative performance impact of DRAM refresh, we propose two
complementary mechanisms, DARP (Dynamic Access Refresh Parallelization) and
SARP (Subarray Access Refresh Parallelization). The goal is to address the
drawbacks of per-bank refresh by building more efficient techniques to
parallelize refreshes and accesses within DRAM. First, instead of issuing
per-bank refreshes in a round-robin order, DARP issues per-bank refreshes to
idle banks in an out-of-order manner. Furthermore, DARP schedules refreshes
during intervals when a batch of writes are draining to DRAM. Second, SARP
exploits the existence of mostly-independent subarrays within a bank. With
minor modifications to DRAM organization, it allows a bank to serve memory
accesses to an idle subarray while another subarray is being refreshed.
Extensive evaluations show that our mechanisms improve system performance and
energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art refresh policies and the benefit
increases as DRAM density increases.

classical part. A numerical study of temporal behavior of quantum variances and
covariances from given initial states up to states in the infinite time limit
is given using the proposed method. It is shown that at comparatively high
temperatures the steady state total variances are almost classical, because
their pure quantum parts tend to zero in this regime. Otherwise, at
comparatively low temperatures, the pure quantum parts of variances are not
zeroing in steady states manifesting a finite contribution to total values. The
same is true for the covariance. The larger the temperature, the lower is the
quantum contribution to the total covariance. As well as entanglement measures,
quantum discord, the pure quantum contributions in the covariance matrix
elements are important characteristics of the temporal dynamics of complex
quantum systems.

carried out using high resolution grating spectral data from XMM-Newton
satellite (WAX-I). Here we discuss the global dynamical properties as well as
the energetics of the WA components detected in the WAX sample. The slope of WA
density profile ($n\propto r^{-\alpha}$) estimated from the linear regression
slope of ionization parameter $\xi$ and column density $N_H$ in the WAX sample
is $\alpha=1.236\pm 0.034$. We find that the WA clouds possibly originate as a
result of photo-ionised evaporation from the inner edge of the torus (torus
wind). They can also originate in the cooling front of the shock generated by
faster accretion disk outflows, the ultra-fast outflows (UFO), impinging onto
the interstellar medium or the torus. The acceleration mechanism for the WA is
complex and neither radiatively driven wind nor MHD driven wind scenario alone
can describe the outflow acceleration. However, we find that radiative forces
play a significant role in accelerating the WA through the soft X-ray
absorption lines, and also with dust opacity. Given the large uncertainties in
the distance and volume filling factor estimates of the WA, we conclude that
the kinetic luminosity $\dot{E}_k$ of WA may sometimes be large enough to yield
significant feedback to the host galaxy. We find that the lowest ionisation
states carry the maximum mass outflow, and the sources with higher Fe M UTA
absorption ($15-17\rm \AA$) have more mass outflow rates.

integrity maintained along the supply chain. Consumers can therefore safeguard
their stake by authenticating a specific wine product with their NFC-enabled
smartphones before purchasing at the retail points. NAS utilizes Near-field
Communication (NFC), which has emerged as a promising technology and
communication protocol for developing innovative alternatives, to facilitate
the wine record processing of wine products and in turn combat wine and spirit
counterfeiting. The integrated NAS is consisted of a wide range of hardware and
software components, and the best combination of settings, parameters and
deployments will therefore be identified. Other possible implementation issues,
such as tag selection, tag programming and encryption, setup of back-end
database servers and the design of NFC mobile application will also be
discussed in this project. The critical design of NAS is vital not only to the
key of product anti-counterfeiting of wine industry, but also to the strong

an additional, significant energy and pressure component and might influence

at \gamma-ray energies gives us the unique opportunity to study non-thermal
phenomena associated with hadronic CRs and their relation to the star-formation

ground-based \gamma-ray telescopes are being reviewed and the current state of
theoretical work on the \gamma-ray emission is discussed. A special emphasis is

viable mass spectra. By assuming the singlet Higgs mass at 750 GeV, its total
width less than 50 GeV and imposing constraints from the LHC 8-TeV data, we
identify an approximately linear region on the $(v_\Delta, \alpha)$ plane along
which the exotic Higgs boson masses satisfy a specific hierarchy and have lower
possible spectra, where $v_\Delta$ denotes the triplet vacuum expectation value
and $\alpha$ is the mixing angle between the singlet Higgs boson and the

enhanced by charged Higgs bosons running in the loop in this region, it is
mostly orders of magnitude smaller than that required for the observed
production rate, except for the small $v_\Delta$ region when the diphoton
fusion production mechanism becomes dominant. Nonetheless, this part of
parameter space suffers from the problems of breakdown of perturbativity and
large uncertainties in the photon parton distribution function of proton.

in geophysical fluids and also ultra-short pulses in nonlinear optics. We show
that the breather can be converted into different types of stationary nonlinear
waves on constant backgrounds, including the multi-peak soliton, M-shaped
soliton, W-shaped soliton and periodic wave. We also investigate the nonlinear
interactions between these waves, which display some novel patterns due to the
non-propagating characteristics of the solitons: (1) Two antidark solitons can
produce a W-shaped soliton instead of a higher-order antidark one, (2) The
interaction between an antidark soliton and a W-shaped soliton can not only
generate a higher-order antidark soliton, but also form a W-shaped solion pair,
(3) The interactions between an oscillation W-shaped soliton and an oscillation
M-shaped soliton show the multipeak structures. We find that the transition
occurs at a modulational stability region in a low perturbation frequency
region.

on large landscape areas. This reproductive pattern is generally perceived as a
synchronous periodic production of large seed crops and has a significant
practical importance to forest natural regeneration in order to synchronize
cuttings. The mechanisms of masting are still argued and models of this
phenomenon are uncommon, so a stochastic approach can cast significant light on
some particular aspects. Trees manage to get synchronized and coordinate their
reproductive routines. But is it possible that trees get synchronized by
chance, absolutely random? Using a Monte Carlo simulation of seeding years and
a theoretical masting pattern, a stochastic analysis is performed in order to
assess the chance of random mast fruiting. Two populations of 100 trees, with
different fruiting periodicity of 2-3 years and 4-6 years, were set and the
fruition dynamic was simulated for 100 years. The results show that periodicity
itself cannot induce by chance the masting effect, but periodicity
mathematically influences the reproductive pattern.

(EMF) is shown for nonparallel nanosized metal plates arranged in the form of a
periodic structure. It is found that EMF does not appear in strictly periodic
structures with parallel plates. However, when the strict periodicity is
disturbed in nonparallel plates, EMF is generated, and its value is equal to
the number of pairs of plates in a configuration. Moreover, there are some
effective parameters of the configuration (angles between plates, plate lengths
and length to length ratios), at which the EMF generation per unit of the
length of the periodic structure is maximal.

viscosity vanishes, but its variance is not zero. Vortex structures arising in
this medium show infinitely long lifetime owing to zero average viscosity. The
nonzero variance is conditioned by exchanging the vortex energy with zero-point
vacuum fluctuations. The vortex has a non-zero core where the orbital speed
vanishes. The speed reaches a maximal value on the core wall and further it
decreases monotonically. The vortex trembles around some average value and

applications. Field oriented control (FOC) and direct torque control (DTC) are
commonly used methods in high performance vector control for asynchronous
motors. Therefore, it is very important to identify clearly advantages and
disadvantages of both systems in the selection of appropriate control methods
for many industrial applications. This paper aims to present a new and
different perspective regarding the comparison of the switching behaviours on
the FOC and the DTC drivers. For this purpose, the experimental studies have
been carried out to compare the inverter switching frequencies and torque
responses of the asynchronous motor in the FOC and the DTC systems under
different working conditions. The dSPACE 1103 controller board was programmed
with Matlab/Simulink software. As expected, the experimental studies showed
that the FOC controlled motors has a lessened torque ripple. On the other hand,
the FOC controlled motor switching frequency has about 65-75% more than the DTC
controlled under both loaded and unloaded working conditions.
