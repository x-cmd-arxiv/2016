study of this source around periastron. INTEGRAL observations shortly before
and after the XMM-Newton observation show the source to be in an atypically
active state. Over the course of the XMM-Newton observation, the source shows a
dynamic range of ~100 with a luminosity greater than 1$\times$10$^{35}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ for the majority of the observation. After an ~6 ks period of low
luminosity (~10$^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$) emission, SAX J1818.6-1703 enters a phase
of fast flaring activity, with flares 250 s long, separated by ~2ks. The source
then enters a larger flare event of higher luminosity and ~8 ks duration.
Spectral analysis revealed evidence for a significant change in spectral shape
during the observation with a photon index varying from {\Gamma} ~ 2.5 during
the initial low luminosity emission phase, to {\Gamma} ~ 1.9 through the fast
flaring activity, and a significant change to {\Gamma} ~ 0.3 during the main
flare. The intrinsic absorbing column density throughout the observation (n$_H$
~ 5$\times$10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) is among the highest measured from an SFXT, and
together with the XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL luminosities, consistent with the
neutron star encountering an unusually dense wind environment around
periastron. Although other mechanisms cannot be ruled out, we note that the
onset of the brighter flares occurs at 3$\times$10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$, a
luminosity consistent with the threshold for the switch from a
radiative-dominated to Compton cooling regime in the quasi-spherical settling
accretion model.

of the Polyakov loop per configuration is close to $\theta = 0$, $\pm \, 2 \pi

$\theta \approx \pm \, 2 \pi /3$. This difference between the form factors is a
property of the deconfined phase and a sign of the spontaneous breaking of the
center symmetry. Furthermore, given that this difference vanishes in the
confined phase, it can be used as an order parameter associated to the
deconfinement transition. For simulations near the critical temperature $T_c$,
the difference between the propagators associated to $\theta \approx 0$ and
$\theta \approx \pm \, 2 \pi /3$ allows to classify the configurations as

densities to address open questions in neutron star phenomenology.
Traditionally, the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approach has been used to compute
gaps from bare nucleon-nucleon interactions. Here, we incorporate the influence
of short- and long-range correlations in the pairing gaps. Short-range
correlations are treated including the appropriate fragmentation of
single-particle states, and substantially suppress the gaps. Long-range
correlations dress the pairing interaction via density and spin modes, and
provide a relatively small correction. We use different interactions, some with
three-body forces, as a starting point to control for any systematic effects.
Results are relevant for neutron-star cooling scenarios, in particular in view
of the recent observational data on Cassiopeia A.

rotation curves, paradoxically acting as if their most remarkable asymmetric
features, such as lopsidedness or spiral arms, were not important. In this
article, we relax the axisymmetry approximation and introduce a methodology
that derives 3D gravitational potentials of disk-like objects and robustly
estimates the impacts of asymmetries on circular velocities in the disk
midplane. Mass distribution models can then be directly fitted to asymmetric
line-of-sight velocity fields. Applied to the grand-design spiral M99, the new
strategy shows that circular velocities are highly nonuniform, particularly in
the inner disk of the galaxy, as a natural response to the perturbed
gravitational potential of luminous matter. A cuspy inner density profile of
dark matter is found in M99, in the usual case where luminous and dark matter
share the same center. The impact of the velocity nonuniformity is to make the
inner profile less steep, although the density remains cuspy. On another hand,
a model where the halo is core dominated and shifted by 2.2-2.5 kpc from the
luminous mass center is more appropriate to explain most of the kinematical
lopsidedness evidenced in the velocity field of M99. However, the gravitational
potential of luminous baryons is not asymmetric enough to explain the
kinematical lopsidedness of the innermost regions, irrespective of the density
shape of dark matter. This discrepancy points out the necessity of an
additional dynamical process in these regions: possibly a lopsided distribution
of dark matter.

and modified gravity theories have been proposed so far. It is argued in the
literature that they are difficult to be distinguished on the cosmological
scales. Therefore, it is well motivated to consider the relevant astrophysical
phenomena on (or below) the galactic scales. In this work, we study the
stability of self-gravitating differentially rotating galactic disks in $f(T)$
theory, and obtain the local stability criteria in $f(T)$ theory, which are
valid for all $f(T)$ theories satisfying $f(T=0)=0$ and $f_T (T=0)\not=0$, if
the adiabatic approximation and the weak field limit are considered. The
information of the function $f(T)$ is mainly encoded in the parameter
$\alpha\equiv 1/f_T(T=0)$. We find that the local stability criteria in $f(T)$
theory are quite different from the ones in Newtonian gravity, general
relativity, and other modified gravity theories such as $f(R)$ theory. We
consider that this might be a possible hint to distinguish $f(T)$ theory from
general relativity and other modified gravity theories on (or below) the
galactic scales.

For a special equivalent class, we identify a new spin-orbital entangled
commensurate ground ( Y-y ) state subject to strong quantum fluctuations at
$T=0$. We evaluate the quantum fluctuations by the spin wave expansion up to
order $ 1/S^2 $. In some SOC parameter regime, the Y-y state supports a massive
relativistic in-commensurate magnon ( C-IC ) with its two gap minima positions
continuously tuned by the SOC parameters. The C-IC magnons dominate all the low
temperature thermodynamic quantities and also lead to the separation of the
peak positions between the longitudinal and the transverse spin structure
factors. In the weak coupling limit, any weak repulsive interaction also leads
to a weak Y-y state. There is only a crossover from the weak to the strong
coupling. High temperature expansions of the specific heats in both weak and
strong coupling are presented. The dramatic roles to be played by these C-IC
magnons at generic SOC parameters or under various external probes are hinted.

in vitro experiments because of its physiological significance in the cochlear
amplifier, which provides the exquisite sensitivity and frequency selectivity
of the mammalian ear. However, these studies have been performed largely under
load-free conditions or with static load, while these cells function in vivo in
a dynamic environment, receiving electrical energy to enhance mechanical
oscillation in the inner ear. This gap leaves uncertainties in addressing a key
issue, how much mechanical energy an OHC provides. The present report is an
attempt of bridging the gap by introducing a simple one-dimensional model for
electromotility of OHC in a dynamic environment. This model incorporates a
feedback loop involving the receptor potential and the mechanical load on OHC,
and leads to an analytical expression for the membrane capacitance, which
explicitly describes the dependence on the elastic load, viscous drag, and the
mass. The derived equation of motion was examined in a mass-less model system
with realistic parameter values for OHC. It was found that viscous drag is more
effective than elastic load in enhancing the receptor potential that drives the

We study partonic energy loss in the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) by
investigating the centrality dependence of the binary-collision-scaled
high-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ yields. Observing a decrease of the scaled yield in more
central collisions is proposed as a possible signature for jet quenching. Even
at energies and centralities where this signature is lost a QGP may still be
formed since competing phenomena responsible for enhancements may overwhelm the
suppression from energy loss. Measurements in several ranges of
$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ from $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27,
39, 62.4, and 200 GeV data show that relative hadron suppression persists at
least down to 14.5 GeV.
  To further investigate both the possible formation of a QGP at these lower
energies and whether the observed hadron suppression coincides with the onset
of other QGP signatures, we examine the energy and centrality dependence of
$v_{3}$. Models have shown that the development of $v_{3}$ requires the
presence of a low viscosity phase early in the collision. We find that for
collisions with $N_{\mathrm{part}}$<50, $v_{3}$ disappears for energies below
14.5 GeV, suggestive of a turn-off of the QGP. But for $N_{\mathrm{part}}$>50,
$v_{3}$ persists down to the lowest energies. Together, these signatures
provide possible evidence for the formation of a QGP in the lowest energy

a player physically acts out (using his/her real body and senses) his/her

mixed-reality environment where the game happens. The game stage is a kind of
""augmented virtuality""; a mixed-reality where the virtual world is augmented
with real-world information. In live-action virtual reality games, players wear
HMD devices and see a virtual world that is constructed using the physical
world architecture as the basic geometry and context information. Physical
objects that reside in the physical world are also mapped to virtual elements.
Live-action virtual reality games keeps the virtual and real-worlds
superimposed, requiring players to physically move in the environment and to
use different interaction paradigms (such as tangible and embodied interaction)
to complete game activities. This setup enables the players to touch physical
architectural elements (such as walls) and other objects, ""feeling"" the game
stage. Players have free movement and may interact with physical objects placed
in the game stage, implicitly and explicitly. Live-action virtual reality games
differ from similar game concepts because they sense and use contextual
information to create unpredictable game experiences, giving rise to emergent
gameplay.

investigated by means of a new direct numerical simulation code, spectral in
the two horizontal directions and compact-finite-differences in the direction
of the shear. No remeshing is used to impose the shear-periodic boundary
condition. The influence of the geometry of the computational box is explored.
Since HST has no characteristic outer length scale and tends to fill the
computational domain, long-term simulations of HST are `minimal' in the sense
of containing on average only a few large-scale structures. It is found that
the main limit is the spanwise box width, $L_z$, which sets the length and
velocity scales of the turbulence, and that the two other box dimensions should
be sufficiently large $(L_x\gtrsim 2L_z$, $L_y \gtrsim L_z$) to prevent other
directions to be constrained as well. It is also found that very long boxes,
$L_x \gtrsim 2 L_y$, couple with the passing period of the shear-periodic
boundary condition, and develop strong unphysical linearized bursts. Within
those limits, the flow shows interesting similarities and differences with
other shear flows, and in particular with the logarithmic layer of wall-bounded
turbulence. They are explored in some detail. They include a self-sustaining
process for large-scale streaks and quasi-periodic bursting. The bursting time
scale is approximately universal, $\sim 20 S^{-1}$, and the availability of two
different bursting systems allows the growth of the bursts to be related with
some confidence to the shearing of initially isotropic turbulence. It is
concluded that SS-HST, conducted within the proper computational parameters, is
a very promising system to study shear turbulence in general.

signals to describe them very efficiently. On the other hand, the field of
compressed sensing is built upon the observation that ""structured"" signals can
be recovered from their under-determined set of linear projections. Currently,
there is a large gap between the complexity of the structures studied in the
area of compressed sensing and those employed by the state-of-the-art
compression codes. Recent results in the literature on deterministic signals
aim at bridging this gap through devising compressed sensing decoders that
employ compression codes. This paper focuses on structured stochastic processes
and studies the application of rate-distortion codes to compressed sensing of
such signals. The performance of the formerly-proposed compressible signal
pursuit (CSP) algorithm is studied in this stochastic setting. It is proved
that in the very low distortion regime, as the blocklength grows to infinity,
the CSP algorithm reliably and robustly recovers $n$ instances of a stationary
process from random linear projections as long as their count is slightly more
than $n$ times the rate-distortion dimension (RDD) of the source. It is also
shown that under some regularity conditions, the RDD of a stationary process is
equal to its information dimension (ID). This connection establishes the
optimality of the CSP algorithm at least for memoryless stationary sources, for
which the fundamental limits are known. Finally, it is shown that the CSP
algorithm combined by a family of universal variable-length fixed-distortion
compression codes yields a family of universal compressed sensing recovery
algorithms.

to study the behavior of the quantum fields in such a space. Anderson and
DeWitt were the first to consider the free scalar field in the trousers
spacetime. They argued that the crotch singularity produces an infinitely
bright flash, which was interpreted as evidence that the topology of space is
dynamically preserved. Similar divergencies were later discovered by Manogue,
Copeland and Dray who used a more exotic quantization scheme. Later yet the

conclusion that the topological transition in question is suppressed in quantum
gravity.

their choice of the Fock space. By choosing a different one-particle Hilbert

For this purpose we developed an algorithm for a quick evaluation of the
tunneling action, which in most cases is accurate within 10%. We find that
stability of a vacuum is strongly correlated with its energy density, with
lifetime rapidly growing as the energy density is decreased. The probability
$P(B)$ for a vacuum to have a tunneling action $B$ greater than a given value
declines as a slow power law in $B$. This is in sharp contrast with the studies
of random quartic potentials, which found a fast exponential decline of $P(B)$.
Our results suggest that the total number of relatively stable vacua (say, with
$B> 100$) grows exponentially with the number of fields $N$ and can get
extremely large for $N\gtrsim 100$. The problem with this kind of model is that
the stable vacua are concentrated near the absolute minimum of the potential,
so the observed value of the cosmological constant cannot be explained without
fine-tuning. To address this difficulty, we consider a modification of the
model, where the axions acquire a quadratic mass term, due to their mixing with
4-form fields. This results in a larger landscape with a much broader
distribution of vacuum energies. The number of relatively stable vacua in such
models can still be extremely large.

interactions can give rise to complex and unexpected collective states that
emerge on a fundamentally different lengthscale to that of the interactions
themselves. While in certain cases - e.g. the self-assembly of virus-like
polyhedral cages from coordination building blocks - it is possible to control
emergence in a systematic manner, the development of general approaches remains
a fundamental challenge in the field. In the conceptually-related domain of
frustrated magnetism - where collective states give rise to exotic physics of
relevance to data storage and spintronics - the task of predicting emergent
behaviour is simplified through control over the geometry and form of the
magnetic interactions from which complexity arises. Seeking to combine
approaches from these two fields, we study here the solid phases of inorganic
polymer chains assembled from non-magnetic gold(I)/silver(I) cations and
cyanide anions. We show the periodic inter-chain potential encodes a
supramolecular interaction that can be tuned to mimic different magnetic
interactions between XY spins (""spin rotors""). Because the chains pack on a
triangular lattice, the crystal structures of gold(I)/silver(I) cyanides can be
interpreted in terms of the phase behaviour of triangular XY magnets. Complex
magnetic states predicted for this family - including hidden quadrupolar order
and emergent spin-vortex quasiparticles - are realised for the first time in
the structural chemistry of these cyanide polymers. In this way we demonstrate
both how simple inorganic materials might behave as structural analogues of
otherwise-unrealisable ""toy"" spin models, and also how a theoretical
understanding of those models might be used to predict and control emergent
phenomena in chemical systems.

pairs of fermions (BCS-BEC crossover) in 2D models of interacting fermions with
small Fermi energy EF and weak attractive interaction, which extends to
energies well above EF. The 2D case is special because one has to distinguish
between bound state formation and superconductivity already at weak coupling.
We briefly review the situation in the one-band model and then consider two
different two-band models: the one with a hole and an electron band, and the
one with two electron bands. In each case we obtain the bound state energy 2 E0
for two fermions in a vacuum and solve the set of coupled equations for the
pairing gaps and the chemical potentials to obtain the onset temperature of the
pairing, Tins and the quasiparticle dispersion. We then compute the superfluid
stiffness and obtain the actual Tc. We show that, at EF >> E0 the behavior of
both two-band models is BCS-like in the sense that Tc almost coincides with
Tins and both are much smaller than EF. At EF < E0, the two models behave
differently: in the model with two electron bands, Tins ~E0/log(E0/EF) and Tc
~EF << Tins. In between Tins and Tc the system displays preformed pair
behavior. In the model with a hole and an electron band, Tins ~ Tc and both
remain finite at EF=0 The preformed pair behavior still exists in this model
because Tc is numerically smaller than Tins. For both models we re-express Tins
in terms of the fully renormalized two-particle scattering amplitude by
extending to two-band case the method pioneered by Gorkov and Melik-Barkhudarov
back in 1961. We apply our results to to Nb-doped SrTiO3 and to Fe-pnictides
and Fe-chalcogenides, particularly to FeSe, in which superconducting gap is
comparable to the Fermi energy.

star LMXB 4U 1608-52. The ~200 s long X-ray burst occurred during a hard X-ray
spectral state, and had a peak intensity of ~30-50 per cent of the Eddington
limit with no signs of photospheric radius expansion. Spectral analysis
suggests that the accretion emission was enhanced up to a factor of ~5 during
the X-ray burst. We also applied a linear unsupervised decomposition method,
namely non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), to study this X-ray burst. We
find that the NMF performs well in characterizing the evolution of the burst
emission and is a promising technique to study changes in the underlying
accretion emission in more detail than is possible through conventional
spectral fitting. For the burst of 4U 1608-52, the NMF suggests a possible
softening of the accretion spectrum during the X-ray burst, which could
potentially be ascribed to cooling of a corona. Finally, we report a small (~3
per cent) but significant rise in the accretion emission ~0.5 h before the

ignition.

further studies of this important cloud. In this first paper we present the
observations, data reduction, and source catalog generation. To demonstrate the
data quality, we present a first application of our catalog to estimate the
number of stars currently forming inside Orion A and to verify the existence of
a more evolved young foreground population. We used the European Southern
Observatory's (ESO) Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA)
to survey the entire Orion A molecular cloud in the NIR $J, H$, and $K_S$
bands, covering a total of $\sim$18.3 deg$^2$. We implemented all data
reduction recipes independently of the ESO pipeline. Estimates of the young
populations toward Orion A are derived via the $K_S$-band luminosity function.
Our catalog (799995 sources) increases the source counts compared to the Two
Micron All Sky Survey by about an order of magnitude. The 90% completeness
limits are 20.4, 19.9, and 19.0 mag in $J, H$, and $K_S$, respectively. The
reduced images have 20% better resolution on average compared to pipeline
products. We find between 2300 and 3000 embedded objects in Orion A and confirm
that there is an extended foreground population above the Galactic field, in
agreement with previous work. The Orion A VISTA catalog represents the most
detailed NIR view of the nearest massive star-forming region and provides a
fundamental basis for future studies of star formation processes toward Orion.

particularly strengthened analogies to cuprate high-$T_c$ superconductors.
However, unlike the cuprate phase diagram that features a plethora of broken

nematic and possibly intra-unit cell loop-current orders, no broken symmetry
phases proximate to the parent antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase in

cuprate phenomenology incomplete. Using optical second harmonic generation, we
report evidence of a hidden non-dipolar magnetic order in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ that
breaks both the spatial inversion and rotational symmetries of the underlying
tetragonal lattice. Four distinct domain types corresponding to discrete
90$^{\circ}$ rotated orientations of a pseudovector order parameter are
identified using nonlinear optical microscopy, which is expected from an
electronic phase that possesses the symmetries of a magneto-electric
loop-current order. The onset temperature of this phase is monotonically
suppressed with bulk hole doping, albeit much more weakly than the N\'eel

detect signatures of radial flows. We develop a new Fourier decomposition
scheme that fits for rotational and radial velocities and simultaneously
determines position angle and inclination as a function of radius. Using
synthetic velocity fields we show that our novel fitting scheme is less prone

X-ray-detected UCDs, seven show evidence of long-term X-ray time variability on

non-X-ray-detected UCDs, and we find tentative evidence that the X-ray
detection fraction increases with surface luminosity density and global stellar
velocity dispersion. The X-ray emission of UCDs is fully consistent with
arising from a population of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). In fact, there
are fewer X-ray sources than expected using a naive extrapolation from globular
clusters. Invoking the fundamental plane of black hole activity for SUCD1 near
the Sombrero galaxy, for which archival Jansky Very Large Array imaging at 5

central black hole in that UCD to be $\lesssim10^5M_{\odot}$. While the
majority of our sources are likely LMXBs, we cannot rule out central black
holes in some UCDs based on X-rays alone, and so we address the utility of
follow-up radio observations to find weakly-accreting central black holes.

possibility that those indeed arise from mergers. The same ejecta will also
produce a long term (months to years) radio emission due to its interaction
with the surrounding ISM. In search for this emission, we observed the two

neutron star (a magnetar), which has been suggested as the central engine for
GRBs. Such a magnetar will deposit a significant fraction of its energy into
the ejecta leading to a brighter radio flare. Our results, therefore, rule out
magnetars in these two events.

the hardware and software for rapid data processing, as well as transient
detection and follow-up, necessary for the full 270 deg$^2$ survey.
Classification of variable and transient sources relied heavily on the wealth
of multi-wavelength data in the Stripe 82 region, supplemented by repeated
mapping of the region by the Palomar Transient Factory. $3.9^{+0.5}_{-0.9}$% of
the detected point sources were found to vary by greater than 30%, consistent
with similar studies at 1.4 GHz and 5 GHz. Multi-wavelength photometric data
and light curves suggest that the variability is mostly due to shock-induced
flaring in the jets of AGN. Although this was only a pilot survey, we detected
two bona fide transients, associated with an RS CVn binary and a dKe star.
Comparison with existing radio survey data revealed additional highly variable
and transient sources on timescales between 5-20 years, largely associated with
renewed AGN activity. The rates of such AGN possibly imply episodes of enhanced
accretion and jet activity occurring once every $\sim$40,000 years in these

because they obey entanglement area laws. They have been used to construct
explicit toy models realizing many interesting structural features of the
AdS/CFT correspondence, including the non-uniqueness of bulk operator
reconstruction in the boundary theory. In this article, we explore the
holographic properties of networks of random tensors. We find that our models
naturally incorporate many features that are analogous to those of the AdS/CFT
correspondence. When the bond dimension of the tensors is large, we show that
the entanglement entropy of boundary regions, whether connected or not, obey
the Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula, a fact closely related to known properties
of the multipartite entanglement of assistance. Moreover, we find that each
boundary region faithfully encodes the physics of the entire bulk entanglement
wedge. Our method is to interpret the average over random tensors as the
partition function of a classical ferromagnetic Ising model, so that the
minimal surfaces of Ryu-Takayanagi appear as domain walls. Upon including the
analog of a bulk field, we find that our model reproduces the expected
corrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula: the minimal surface is displaced and
the entropy is augmented by the entanglement of the bulk field. Increasing the
entanglement of the bulk field ultimately changes the minimal surface
topologically in a way similar to creation of a black hole. Extrapolating bulk
correlation functions to the boundary permits the calculation of the scaling
dimensions of boundary operators, which exhibit a large gap between a small
number of low-dimension operators and the rest. While we are primarily
motivated by AdS/CFT duality, our main results define a more general form of
bulk-boundary correspondence which could be useful for extending holography to
other spacetimes.

ground state of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice for square and
cylindrical subsystems. We find that, for both the subsystems, the
free-fermionic contribution to the entanglement entropy $S_E$ exhibits
signatures of the phase transitions between the gapless and gapped phases.
However, we find that $S_E$ does not show an expected monotonic behaviour as a
function of the coupling $J_z$ between the suitably defined one-dimensional
chains within the gapless phase for either geometry; moreover the system
generically reaches a point of minimum entanglement within the gapless phase
before the entanglement saturates or increases again until the gapped phase is
reached. This may be attributed to the competition between the nearest
neighbour correlation functions of the $x-x$ and $z-z$ bonds, and to the onset
of gapless $\vec{k}$-modes in the bulk spectrum. On the other hand $S_E$ always
monotonically varies with $J_z$ in the gapped phase independent of the
subregion size or shape. Finally, further confirming the Li-Haldane conjecture,
we find that the Schmidt gap $\Delta$ defined from the entanglement spectrum
also signals the topological transitions but only if there are corresponding
zero energy Majorana edge states that simultaneously appear or disappear across
the transitions. We analytically corroborate some of our results on
entanglement entropy, Schmidt gap and the bulk-edge correspondence using
perturbation theory.

the cold (~ 10 K) gas has cast doubts on the commonly accepted formation
mechanisms of these species. Standard gas-phase mechanisms are inefficient and
tend to underproduce these molecules, and many of the key reactions involved
are unconstrained. Grain-surface mechanisms, which were presented as a viable
alternative, suffer from the fact that they rely on grain surface diffusion of
heavy radicals, which is not possible thermally at very low temperatures. One
of the simplest terrestrial complex organic molecules, methanol is believed to
form on cold grain surfaces following from successive H atom additions on CO.
Unlike heavier species, H atoms are very mobile on grain surfaces even at 10 K.
Intermediate species involved in grain surface methanol formation by CO
hydrogenation are the radicals HCO and CH3O, as well as the stable species
formaldehyde H2CO. These radicals are thought to be precursors of complex
organic molecules on grain surfaces. We present new observations of the HCO and
CH3O radicals in a sample of prestellar cores and carry out an analysis of the
abundances of the species HCO, H2CO, CH3O, and CH3OH, which represent the
various stages of grain-surface hydrogenation of CO to CH3OH. The abundance
ratios between the various intermediate species in the hydrogenation reaction
of CO on grains are similar in all sources of our sample, HCO:H2CO:CH3O:CH3OH ~
10:100:1:100. We argue that these ratios may not be representative of the
primordial abundances on the grains but, rather, suggest that the radicals HCO
and CH3O are gas-phase products of the precursors H2CO and CH3OH, respectively.
Gas-phase pathways are considered and simple estimates of HCO and CH3O
abundances are compared to the observations. Critical reaction rate constants,
branching ratios, and intermediate species are finally identified.

the PAH features may be as accurate a SFR indicator as hydrogen recombination

cosmology. To date, the most accurate measurements have been obtained with Type
Ia Supernovae and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, providing evidence for the
existence of a transition epoch at which the expansion rate changes from
decelerated to accelerated. However, these results have been obtained within
the framework of specific cosmological models that must be implicitly or
explicitly assumed in the measurement. It is therefore crucial to obtain
measurements of the accelerated expansion of the Universe independently of
assumptions on cosmological models. Here we exploit the unprecedented
statistics provided by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data
Release 9 to provide new constraints on the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ using the
em cosmic chronometers approach. We extract a sample of more than 130000 of the
most massive and passively evolving galaxies, obtaining five new
cosmology-independent $H(z)$ measurements in the redshift range $0.3<z<0.5$,
with an accuracy of $\sim$11-16\% incorporating both statistical and systematic
errors. Once combined, these measurements yield a 6\% accuracy constraint of
$H(z=0.4293)=91.8\pm5.3$ km/s/Mpc. The new data are crucial to provide the
first cosmology-independent determination of the transition redshift at high
statistical significance, measuring $z_{t}=0.4\pm0.1$, and to significantly
disfavor the null hypothesis of no transition between decelerated and
accelerated expansion at 99.9\% confidence level. This analysis highlights the
wide potential of the cosmic chronometers approach: it permits to derive
constraints on the expansion history of the Universe with results competitive
with standard probes, and most importantly, being the estimates independent of
the cosmological model, it can constrain cosmologies beyond -and including- the
$\Lambda$CDM model.

National University 2.3 m telescope have revealed the remarkable features of
bipolar collimated jets emerging from its main structure. Velocity-resolved
channel maps derived from the [N II] $\lambda$6584 emission line disentangle
different morphological components of the nebula. This information is used to
develop a three-dimensional morpho-kinematic model, which consists of an
equatorial dense torus and a pair of asymmetric bipolar outflows. The expansion
velocity of about 20 km s$^{-1}$ is measured from the spectrum integrated over
the main shell. However, the deprojected velocities of the jets are found to be
in the range of 80-160 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the nebular center. It is
found that the mean density of the collimated outflows, 595 $\pm$ 125
cm$^{-3}$, is five times lower than that of the main shell, 3150 cm$^{-3}$,
whereas their singly ionized nitrogen and sulfur abundances are about three
times higher than those determined from the dense shell. The results indicate
that the features of the collimated jets are typical of fast, low-ionization
emission regions.

back reaction of quarks into the Polyakov-loop effective potential bringing a
reduction of the pressure above $T_c$ from the Stefan-Boltzmann limit. We get a
good agreement with lattice-QCD data at low and moderate temperatures, opening
the door to a straightforward extension to finite chemical potential.

the excited states in systems described, in the continuum limit, by a conformal
field theory (CFT). These corrections scale as $L^{-\frac{2\Delta}{n}}$, where
$L$ is the system size and $\Delta$ is the scaling dimension of a relevant bulk
operator located around the singularities of the Riemann surface
$\mathcal{R}_n$. Their name is due to their explicit dependence on the Riemann
surface $\mathcal{R}_n$. Their presence has been detected in several works on
the entanglement entropy in finite size systems, both in the ground and the
excited states. Here, we present a general study of these corrections based on
the perturbation expansion on $\mathcal{R}_n$. Some of the terms in this
expansion are divergent and they will be cured with addition cut-offs. These
cut-offs will determine how these corrections scale with the system size $L$.
Exact numerical computations of the Renyi entropy of the excited states of the
XX model are provided and they confirm our theoretical prediction on the
scaling of corrections. They allow also a comparison with the other works
present in the literature finding that the corrections, for the excited states,
have the exact same form of the ones of the ground state case multiplied by a
model dependend function of $n$ and $l/L$.

compact design, thermal issues become prominent. State of the art work promotes
software decoupled access-execution (DAE) that statically generates code
amenable to DVFS techniques. The compiler builds memory-bound access phases,
designed to prefetch data in the cache at low frequency, and compute-bound
phases, that consume the data and perform computations at high frequency. This
work investigates techniques to find the optimal balance between lightweight
and efficient access phases. A profiling step guides the selection of loads to
be prefetched in the access phase. For applications whose behavior vary
significantly with respect to the input data, the profiling can be performed
online, accompanied by just-in-time compilation. We evaluated the benefits in
energy efficiency and performance for both static and dynamic code generation
and showed that precise prefetching of critical loads can result in 20% energy
improvements, on average. DAE is particularly beneficial for embedded systems
as by alternating access phases (executed at low frequency) and execute phases
(at high frequency) DAE proactively reduces the temperature and therefore
prevents thermal emergencies.

communication topology of {\pi}-terms, and the automatic inference of these

that the communication topology of every term reachable from P satisfies a
T-shaped invariant. We design a static analysis to prove a term hierarchical by
means of a novel type system that enjoys decidable inference. The soundness
proof of the type system employs a non-standard view of {\pi}-calculus
reactions. The coverability problem for hierarchical terms is decidable. This
is proved by showing that every hierarchical term is depth-bounded, an
undecidable property known in the literature. We thus obtain an expressive
static fragment of the {\pi}-calculus with decidable safety verification
problems.

between WASP-94AB, a pair of stars that each host a hot Jupiter exoplanet. The
two stars are very similar in spectral type (F8 and F9), and their ~2700 AU
separation suggests their protoplanetary disks were likely not influenced by
stellar interactions, but WASP-94Ab's orbit -- misaligned with the host star
spin axis and likely retrograde -- points towards a dynamically active
formation mechanism, perhaps different than that of WASP-94Bb, which is not
misaligned and has nearly circular orbit. Based on our high-quality spectra and
strictly relative abundance analysis, we detect a depletion of volatiles
(~-0.02 dex, on average) and enhancement of refractories (~0.01 dex) in
WASP-94A relative to B (standard errors are ~0.005 dex). This is different than
every other published case of binary host star abundances, in which either no
significant abundance differences are reported, or there is some degree of
enhancement in all elements, including volatiles. Several scenarios that may
explain the abundance trend are discussed, but none can be definitively
accepted or rejected. Additional high-contrast imaging observations to search
for companions that may be dynamically affecting the system, as well as a
larger sample of binary host star studies, are needed to better understand the
curious abundance trends we observe in WASP-94AB.

theory to beat the limitations of the classical methods for information

metrology has attracted much attention. Quantum optical coherence tomography
(QOCT), which utilizes two-photon interference between entangled photon pairs,
is a promising approach to overcome the problem with optical coherence
tomography (OCT): As the resolution of OCT becomes higher, degradation of the
resolution due to dispersion within the medium becomes more critical. Here we
report on the realization of 0.54 $\mu$m resolution two-photon interference,
which surpasses the current record resolution 0.75 $\mu$m of low-coherence
interference for OCT. In addition, the resolution for QOCT showed almost no
change against the dispersion of a 1 mm thickness of water inserted in the
optical path, whereas the resolution for OCT dramatically degrades. For this
experiment, a highly-efficient chirped quasi-phase-matched lithium tantalate
device was developed using a novel $`$nano-electrode-poling$'$ technique. The
results presented here represent a breakthrough for the realization of quantum
protocols, including QOCT, quantum clock synchronization, and more. Our work

upon a gravitationally bound, isothermal cylinder of gas. The model
successfully predicts for a cosmological simulation the total mass per unit
length of a filament (dark matter plus gas) based solely upon the sound speed
of the gas component, contrary to the expectation for collisionless dark matter
aggregation. It argues that the gas, through its hydrodynamic properties, plays
a key role in filament structure rather than being a passive passenger in a
preformed dark matter potential. The dark matter of a galaxy follows the
classic equation of collapse of a spherically symmetric overdensity in an
expanding universe. In contrast, the gas usually collapses more slowly. The
relative rates of collapse of these two components for individual galaxies can
explain the varying baryon deficits of the galaxies under the assumption that
matter moves along a single filament passing through the galaxy centre, rather
than by spherical accretion. The difference in behaviour of the dark matter and
gas can be simply and plausibly related to the model. The range of galaxies
studied includes that of the so-called ""too big to fail"" galaxies, which are
thought to be problematic for the standard Lambda-CDM model of the universe.
The isothermal-cylinder model suggests a simple explanation for why these
galaxies are, unaccountably, missing from the night sky.

a novel two-stage approach by integration of $k$-nearest-neighbor (KNN) and
support vector machine (SVM) methods together. In the first stage, we apply KNN
algorithm on photometric data and estimate their corresponding z$_{\rm phot}$.
By analysis, we find two dense regions with catastrophic failure, one in the
range of z$_{\rm phot}\in[0.3,1.2]$, the other in the range of z$_{\rm phot}\in
[1.2,2.1]$. In the second stage, we map the photometric input pattern of points
falling into the two ranges from original attribute space into a high
dimensional feature space by Gaussian kernel function in SVM. In the high
dimensional feature space, many outlier points resulting from catastrophic
failure by simple Euclidean distance computation in KNN can be identified by a
classification hyperplane of SVM and further be corrected. Experimental results

two-stage fusion approach can significantly mitigate catastrophic failure and
improve the estimation accuracy of photometric redshifts of quasars. The

algorithm (QAOA), we show that $ \mu+\Omega(1/\sqrt{D}) $ fraction of the

efficiently produced by QAOA. We do so by showing that the averaged fraction of
constraints being satisfied is $ \mu+\Omega(1/\sqrt{D}) $, with small variance.
Here $ \mu $ is the fraction that would be satisfied by a uniformly random
assignment, and $ D $ is the number of constraints that each variable can
appear. CSPs with typicality include Max-$ k $XOR and Max-$ k $SAT. We point
out how it can be applied to determine the typical ground-state energy of some
local Hamiltonians. We also give a similar result for instances with ""no

from the three detected sources shows no variability or flare emission.
Modelling this quiescent emission we find that it is consistent with optically
thin gyrosynchrotron emission from a magnetosphere with an emitting region

increases for later spectral types and more rapidly rotating objects.

pair of gravitationally bound star clusters that orbit their mutual centre of

We investigate the evolution of binary star clusters with different orbital
configurations, with a particular focus on the Galactic tidal field. We carry
out $N$-body simulations of evolving binary star clusters and compare our
results with estimates from our semi-analytic model. The latter accounts for
mass loss due to stellar evolution and two-body relaxation, and for evolution
due to external tides. Using the semi-analytic model we predict the long-term
evolution for a wide range of initial conditions. It accurately describes the
global evolution of such systems, until the moment when a cluster merger is
imminent. $N$-body simulations are used to test our semi-analytic model and
also to study additional features of evolving binary clusters, such as the
kinematics of stars, global cluster rotation, evaporation rates, and the
cluster merger process. We find that the initial orientation of a binary star
cluster with respect to the Galactic field, and also the initial orbital phase,
are crucial for its fate. Depending on these properties, the binaries may
experience orbital reversal, spiral-in, or vertical oscillation about the
Galactic plane before they actually merge at $t\approx100$~Myr, and produce
rotating star clusters with slightly higher evaporation rates. The merger
process of a binary cluster induces an outburst that ejects $\sim10\%$ of the
stellar members into the Galactic field.

Richardson elements. In \cite{JSY} together with Yu, we generalized

not consistence with numerical simulations and asteroseismic studies.
Asteroseismic studies imply that overshoot is a weak mixing process. Diffusion
model is suitable to deal with it. The form of diffusion coefficient in a
diffusion model is crucial. Because the overshoot mixing is related to the
convective heat transport (i.e., entropy mixing), there should be a similarity
between them. A recent overshoot mixing model shows consistence between
composition mixing and entropy mixing in overshoot region. A prerequisite to
apply the model is to know the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy.
The dissipation rate can be worked out by solving turbulent convection models
(TCMs). But it is difficult to apply TCMs because of some numerical problems
and the enormous time cost. In order to find a convenient way, we have used the
asymptotical solution and simplified the TCM to be a single linear equation for
turbulent kinetic energy. This linear model is easy to be implemented in the
calculations of stellar evolution with ignorable extra time cost. We have
tested the linear model in stellar evolution, and have found that the linear
model can well reproduce the turbulent kinetic energy profile of full TCM, as
well as the diffusion coefficient, abundance profile and the stellar
evolutionary tracks. We have also studied the effects of different values of
the model parameters and have found that the effect due to the modification of
temperature gradient in the overshoot region is slight.

crater closes up near the pool surface and is known to occur only for drops
which are prolate at impact. Herein we use experiments and numerical
simulations to show that a concentrated vortex ring, produced in the neck

large bubbles, as they interact too strongly with the pool surface and
self-destruct. Rather, it is somewhat weaker vortices which can deform the

staggered helical lattices and an efficient numerical method for calculating
their Floquet bandstructure. The lattices support anomalous Floquet topological
insulator phases with vanishing Chern number and tunable topological
transitions. At the critical point of the topological transition, the
bandstructure hosts a single unpaired Dirac cone, which yields a variety of
unusual transport effects: a discrete analogue of conical diffraction, weak
antilocalization not limited by intervalley scattering, and suppression of
Anderson localization. Unlike previous designs, the effective gauge field
strength can be controlled via lattice parameters such as the inter-helix
distance, significantly reducing radiative losses and enabling applications
such as switchable topological wave-guiding.

  interacting scalar fields",,,,,"math-ph math.AP math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Elegant 'microlocal' methods have long since been extensively developed for
the analysis of conventional Schroedinger eigenvalue problems. For technical
reasons though these methods have not heretofore been applicable to quantum
field theories. In this article however we initiate a 'Euclidean signature
semi-classical' program to extend the scope of these analytical techniques to
encompass the study of self-interacting scalar fields in 1 + 1, 2 + 1 and 3 + 1
dimensions. The basic microlocal approach entails, first of all, the solution
of a single, nonlinear equation of Hamilton-Jacobi type followed by the
integration (for both ground and excited states) of a sequence of linear
'transport' equations along the 'flow' generated by the 'fundamental solution'
to the aforementioned Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Using a combination of the
direct method of the calculus of variations, elliptic regularity theory and the
Banach space version of the implicit function theorem we establish, in a
suitable function space setting, the existence, uniqueness and global
regularity of this needed 'fundamental solution' to the relevant, Euclidean
signature Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the systems under study. Our methods are
applicable to (massive) scalar fields with polynomial self-interactions of
renormalizable type. They can, as we shall show elsewhere, also be applied to
Yang-Mills fields in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensions.

from classical databases. Many of these systems compromise ACID properties for
increased horizontal scalability and data availability. This thesis concerns
the development and evaluation of a NoSQL triplestore. Triplestores are
database management systems central to emerging technologies such as the
Semantic Web and linked data. The evaluation spans several benchmarks,
including the two most commonly used in triplestore evaluation, the Berlin
SPARQL Benchmark, and the DBpedia benchmark, a query workload that operates an
RDF representation of Wikipedia. Results reveal that the join algorithm used by
the system plays a critical role in dictating query runtimes. Distributed graph

Keldysh Green's function techniques. By considering the mean-field and Gaussian
fluctuations, we find that the low energy physics of the highly non-equilibrium
phase transition to the optical parametric oscillator regime is in many ways
similar to equilibrium condensation. In particular, we show that this phase
transition can be associated with an effective chemical potential, at which the
system's bosonic distribution function diverges, and an effective temperature.
As in equilibrium systems, the transition is achieved by tuning this effective
chemical potential to the energy of the lowest normal mode. Since the
occupations of the modes are available, we determine experimentally observable
properties, such as the luminescence and absorption spectra.

enhance cooperativity. Cycles of charge transfer can balance charge into and
out of every site, eliminating the charge build-up that limits the
cooperativity of open unidirectional cooperative chains. If cycles of
cooperative HB exist in proteins, these could be expected to be significant in
protein structure and function in ways described below. We find no mention of
an example of this kind of cycle in the literature. We investigate whether
cooperative HB cycles not traversing solvent, ligand or modified residues occur
in proteins by means including search of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
spectroscopy entries of the Protein Data Bank.
  For the direct interactions of inter-amide HB, when the energy associated
with Natural Bond Orbital, NBO, steric exchange is deducted from that of NBO
donor-acceptor interactions, the result is close to zero, so that HB is not
primarily due to the sum of direct inter-amide NBO interactions. The NBO
binding energy is primarily associated with the increase in resonance of the
amides, a consequence of which is that the majority of the NBO binding energy
is susceptible to variation by electrostatic field with component parallel or
antiparallel to an amide C-N bond.
  The question of what geometry most favours HB in amides is revisited with
emphasis on the inequivalence of amide/carbonyl oxygen lone pairs.
  A possible avenue for the design of HB-chaining polymers with improved
stability is discussed.

a new Crout base case variant significantly improves the practical efficiency

using functional renormalization group techniques to determine the

atmospheric structures on the Sun. The ratio of the period of the fundamental
to twice the one of its first overtone, $P_1/2P_2$, is important in
applications of solar magneto-seismology. We examine how field-aligned flows
impact $P_1/2P_2$ of standing modes in solar magnetic cylinders. For coronal
loops, the flow effects are significant for both fast kink and sausage modes.
For kink ones, they reduce $P_1/2P_2$ by up to 17\% relative to the static case
even when the density contrast between the loop and its surroundings approaches
infinity. For sausage modes, the reduction in $P_1/2P_2$ due to flow is
typically $\lesssim 5.5\%$ compared with the static case. However, the
threshold aspect ratio, only above which can trapped sausage modes be
supported, may increase dramatically with the flow magnitude. For photospheric
tubes, the flow effect on $P_1/2P_2$ is not as strong. However, when applied to
sausage modes, introducing field-aligned flows offers more possibilities in
interpreting the multiple periods recently measured. We conclude that
field-aligned flows should be taken into account to help better understand what
causes the departure of $P_1/2P_2$ from unity.

on the three $t_{2g}$ orbitals, namely, the $3d_{xz}$, $3d_{yz}$ and the
$3d_{xy}$ orbital, can be selectively probed in the $\sigma\rightarrow\pi'$
scattering geometry by aligning the direction of the outgoing photon in the
$y$, $x$ and $z$ direction. Such orbital-resolved information on the spin
fluctuation is invaluable for the study of the orbital-selective physics in the
IBSs and can greatly advance our understanding on the relation between orbital
ordering and spin nematicity in the IBSs and the orbital-selective pairing
mechanism in these multi-orbital systems.

applicable for a wide variety of geometries. Our method implements a mixed
Adams-Bashforth/Crank-Nicolson scheme for the nonlinear terms in the MHD
equations and we prove that it is stable independent of the time step. To
ensure that the solenoidal condition is met for the magnetic field, we use a
method whereby a pseudo-pressure is introduced into the induction equation;
since we are concerned with incompressible flows, the resulting Poisson
equation for the pseudo-pressure is solved alongside the equivalent Poisson
problem for the velocity field. We validate our code in a variety of geometries
including periodic boxes, spheres, spherical shells, spheroids and ellipsoids;
for the finite geometries we implement the so-called ferromagnetic or
pseudo-vacuum boundary conditions appropriate for a surrounding medium with
infinite magnetic permeability. This implies that the magnetic field must be
purely perpendicular to the boundary. We present a number of comparisons
against previous results and against analytical solutions, which verify the
code's accuracy. This documents the code's reliability as a prelude to its use
in more difficult problems. We finally present a new simple drifting solution
for thermal convection in a spherical shell that successfully sustains a
magnetic field of simple geometry. By dint of its rapid stabilization from the
given initial conditions, we deem it suitable as a benchmark against which
other self-consistent dynamo codes can be tested.

multiplicative factor of $2^{c\sqrt {\log m}}$ for some absolute constant $c$.
  In this paper we prove that, for integers $m,n,$ satisfying
$n^{9/8}<m<n^{3/2}$, there exist $m$ points and $n$ lines on the quadratic

by Sharir and Solomon. This shows that the assumption that no quadric contains
more than $q$ lines (in the above mentioned theorem of Sharir and Solomon) is
necessary in this regime of $m$ and $n$.
  By a suitable projection from this quadratic hypersurface onto

most $s=O(1)$ lines on a common plane, such that the number of incidences
between the $m$ points and the $n$ lines is $\Theta(m^{2/3}n^{1/2})$. It
remains an interesting question to determine if this bound is also tight in

by such observations allows us to probe the WDM mass functions down to scales
close to or smaller than the half-mass mode mass scale ~10^9 M_sun. This
allowed for an efficient discrimination among predictions for different m_X
which turn out to be independent of the star formation efficiency adopted to
associate the observed UV luminosities of galaxies to the corresponding dark
matter masses. Adopting a conservative approach to take into account the
existing theoretical uncertainties in the galaxy halo mass function, we derive
a robust limit m_X>1.8 keV for the mass of thermal relic WDM particles when
comparing with the measured abundance of the faintest galaxies, while m_X>1.5

luminosity function. The corresponding lower limit for sterile neutrinos
depends on the modeling of the production mechanism; for instance m_sterile > 4

uncertainties on the above bound on m_X. As a baseline for comparison with

observed in the corona. These disturbances propagate upward along the magnetic
field with speeds $\sim100~\rm{km~s}^{-1}$. This phenomenon has been
interpreted as evidence of the propagation of slow magnetosonic waves or argued
to be signature of the intermittent outflows superposed on the background
plasmas. Here we aim to present a new ""wave + flow"" model to interpret these
observations. In our scenario, the oscillatory motion is a slow mode wave, and
the flow is associated with a beam created by the wave-particle interaction
owing to Landau resonance. With the help of a Vlasov model, we simulate the
propagation of the slow mode wave and the generation of the beam flow. We find
that weak periodic beam flows can be generated owing to Landau resonance in the
solar corona, and the phase with strongest blueward asymmetry is ahead of that
with strongest blueshift by about 1/4 period. We also find that the slow wave
damps to the level of 1/e after the transit time of two wave periods, owing to
Landau damping and Coulomb collisions in our simulation. This damping time
scale is similar to that resulting from thermal-conduction in the
magnetohydrodynamics regime. The beam flow is weakened/attenuated with
increasing wave period and decreasing wave amplitude since Coulomb collision
becomes more and more dominant over the wave action. We suggest that this ""wave

quasi-periodic propagating perturbations in various parameters in the solar

di-photon excess at LHC within the framework of a left-right symmetric model.
The 750 GeV neutral scalar in the model is dominantly an admixture of neutral
components of scalar bidoublets with a tiny fraction of neutral scalar triplet.
Incorporating $SU(2)$ septuplet scalar pairs into the model, we enhance the
partial decay width of the 750 GeV neutral scalar into di-photons through
charged septuplet components in loop while keeping the neutral septuplet
components as subdominant dark matter candidates. The model also predicts the
decay width of the 750 GeV scalar to be around 36 GeV to be either confirmed or
ruled out by future LHC data. The requirement of producing the correct
di-photon signal automatically keeps the septuplet dark matter abundance
subdominant in agreement with bounds from direct and indirect detection
experiments. We then briefly discuss different possibilities to account for the
remaining dark matter component of the Universe in terms of other particle
candidates whose stability arise either due to remnant discrete symmetry after
spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_{B-L}$ or due to high $SU(2)$-dimension
forbidding their decay into lighter particles.

the shape of the phase-averaged signature, dominated by a prominent positive

verifying the presence of weak circularly polarized signatures in two other
bright Am stars, beta UMa and theta Leo, and investigating the physical origin
of Sirius-like polarized signals further. We present here a set of deep
spectropolarimetric observations of beta UMa and theta Leo, observed with the
NARVAL spectropolarimeter. We analyzed all spectra with the Least Squares
Deconvolution multiline procedure. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio and
detect extremely weak signatures in Stokes V profiles, we co-added all
available spectra of each star (around 150 observations each time). Finally, we
ran several tests to evaluate whether the detected signatures are consistent
with the behavior expected from the Zeeman effect. The line profiles of the two
stars display circularly polarized signatures similar in shape and amplitude to
the observations previously gathered for Sirius A. Our series of tests brings
further evidence of a magnetic origin of the recorded signal. These new
detections suggest that very weak magnetic fields may well be present in the
photospheres of a significant fraction of intermediate-mass stars. The strongly
asymmetric Zeeman signatures measured so far in Am stars (featuring a dominant
single-sign lobe) are not expected in the standard theory of the Zeeman effect
and may be linked to sharp vertical gradients in photospheric velocities and
magnetic field strengths.

light curve. We then include the Keck and Subaru adaptive optic observation
constraints. The system is composed of a $\sim 4-9$ Gyr lens star of $\rm
M_{lens} = 1.06 \pm 0.05~\,M_\odot$ at a distance of $\rm D_{lens} = 4.0 \pm
0.3~$kpc, orbited by two giant planets of $\rm 0.145 \pm 0.008\ M_{\rm Jup}$
and $0.86 \pm 0.06~\rm M_{\rm Jup}$ with projected separations of $4.0 \pm 0.5
$ AU and $4.8 \pm 0.7$ AU respectively. Since the lens is brighter than the
source star by $16 \pm 8 \%$ in H, with no other blend within one arcsec, it
will be possible to estimate its metallicity by subsequent IR spectroscopy with
8--10~m class telescopes. By adding a constraint on the metallicity it will be
possible to refine the age of the system.

carried out fully atomistic reactive molecular dynamics simulations in order to
address these mechanisms under different experimental conditions. Our results

reconstruction process of a perfect or near perfect graphene structure involves
the formation of linear carbon chains, as well as rings containing 5, 6, 7 and
8 atoms with planar (Stone-Wales) and non-planar (lump like) structures. These

approximate normality of the summary statistics. We relax this assumption by
proposing a novel, more flexible, density estimator: the Extended Empirical
Saddlepoint approximation. In addition to proving the consistency of SL, under
either the new or the Gaussian density estimator, we illustrate the method
using two examples. One of these is a complex individual-based forest model for
which SL offers one of the few practical possibilities for statistical
inference. The examples show that the new density estimator is able to capture
large departures from normality, while being scalable to high dimensions, and
this in turn leads to more accurate parameter estimates, relative to the
Gaussian alternative. The new density estimator is implemented by the esaddle R

We study realistic 3D stellar atmosphere models to find alternative properties.
We find that the asymptotic entropy run of the superadiabatic convective

accurate coefficients. This generic entropy stratification or the solar

improve the modelling of superadiabatic surface layers in stellar structure

a new research dimension has been added to wireless networks. This paper
proposes an interesting use case of this capability for IBFD self-backhauling
heterogeneous networks (HetNet). IBFD self-backhauling in a HetNet refers to
IBFD-enabled small cells backhauling themselves with macro cells over the
wireless channel. Owing to their IBFD capability, the small cells
simultaneously communicate over the access and backhaul links, using the same
frequency band. The idea is doubly advantageous, as it obviates the need for
fiber backhauling small cells every hundred meters and allows the access
spectrum to be reused for backhauling at no extra cost. This work considers the
case of a two-tier cellular network with IBFD-enabled small cells, wirelessly
backhauling themselves with conventional macro cells. For clear exposition, the
case considered is that of FDD network, where within access and backhaul links,
the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) are frequency duplexed ($f1$, $f2$
respectively), while the total frequency spectrum used at access and backhaul
($f1+f2$) is the same. Analytical expressions for coverage and average downlink
(DL) rate in such a network are derived using tools from the field of
stochastic geometry. It is shown that DL rate in such networks could be close
to double that of a conventional TDD/FDD self-backhauling network, at the
expense of reduced coverage due to higher interference in IBFD networks. For
the proposed IBFD network, the conflicting aspects of increased interference on
one side and high spectral efficiency on the other are captured into a
mathematical model. The mathematical model introduces an end-to-end joint
analysis of backhaul (or fronthaul) and access links, in contrast to the
largely available access-centric studies.

execute molecular dynamics simulations with empirical models for KCl-KBr,

of the rapid diffusion phenomenon. It is numerically confirmed that the rate of
the diffusion clearly depends on the size and temperature of the clusters,
which is consistent with experiments. A quite conspicuous feature is that the
surface melting and collective motions of ions are inhibited in alkali halide
clusters. This result indicates that the Surface Peeling Mechanism, which is
responsible for the spontaneous alloying of binary metals, does not play a
dominant role for the spontaneous mixing in alkali halide nanoclusters.
Detailed analysis of atomic motion inside the clusters reveals that the Vacancy
Mechanism is the most important mechanism for the rapid diffusion in alkali

form disk-shaped bilayers, sometimes referred to as bicelles. Using
self-consistent field theory (SCFT), we investigate the structure and stability
of these aggregates in a blend of two species of PS-PDMS diblock with PDMS
homopolymer at 225C. We find that the center of each disk is mainly composed of
lamella-forming diblocks, while its thicker rim is mostly formed of
micelle-forming diblocks. However, this segregation is not perfect, and the
concentration of micelle formers is of the order of 10% on the flat central
surface of the bicelle. We also find that the addition of micelle former to the
mixture of lamella former and homopolymer is necessary for disk-like bicelles
to be stable. Specifically, the free energy density of the disk has a minimum
as a function of the disk radius when both micelle- and lamella-forming
diblocks are present, indicating that the bicelles have a preferred, finite
radius. However, it decays monotonically when only lamella former is present,
indicating that the bicelle structure is always unstable with respect to
further aggregation in these systems. Finally, we identify a concentration
range where the bicelle is predicted to have a lower free energy density than
the simple cylindrical and lamellar aggregates, and so might be
thermodynamically stable.

addition of ground based optical observations and archival results, we produce
spectral energy distribution (SED) fits to these hosts, and show that SLSN
hosts possess lower stellar mass and star formation rates. This is most
pronounced for the hydrogen deficient Type-I SLSN hosts, although Type-II
H-rich SLSN host galaxies remain distinct from the bulk of CCSNe, spanning a
remarkably broad range of absolute magnitudes, with ~30% of SLSNe-II arising
from galaxies fainter than Mn I R ~ -14. The detection of our faintest SLSN
hosts increases the confidence that SLSNe-I hosts are distinct from those of
LGRBs in star formation rate and stellar mass, and suggests that apparent
similarities in metallicity may be due to the limited fraction of hosts for
which emission line metallicity measurements are feasible. The broad range of
luminosities of SLSN-II hosts is difficult to describe by metallicity cuts, and
does not match the expectations of any reasonable UV-weighted luminosity
function, suggesting additional environmental constraints are likely necessary

manifold, with Riemannian metrics in two flavors: Wasserstein and Fisher--Rao.
The former is pivotal in optimal mass transport (OMT), whereas the latter
occurs in information geometry---the differential geometric approach to
statistics. The Riemannian structures restrict to the submanifold of
multivariate Gaussian distributions, where they induce Riemannian metrics on
the space of covariance matrices.
  Here we give a systematic description of classical matrix decompositions (or
factorizations) in terms of Riemannian geometry and compatible principal bundle
structures. Both Wasserstein and Fisher--Rao geometries are discussed. The link
to matrices is obtained by considering OMT and information geometry in the
category of linear transformations and multivariate Gaussian distributions.
This way, OMT is directly related to the polar decomposition of matrices,
whereas information geometry is directly related to the $QR$, Cholesky,
spectral, and singular value decompositions. We also give a coherent
description of gradient flow equations for the various decompositions; most
flows are illustrated in numerical examples.
  The paper is a combination of previously known and original results. As a
survey it covers the Riemannian geometry of OMT and polar decompositions
(smooth and linear category), entropy gradient flows, and the Fisher--Rao
metric and its geodesics on the statistical manifold of multivariate Gaussian

range in mass and are in the focus of ongoing and planned exoplanet surveys. To
investigate and understand their physical nature, detailed spectral information
and accurate stellar models are needed. We use a new synthetic atmosphere model
generation and compare model spectra to observations. To test the model
accuracy, we compared the models to four benchmark stars with atmospheric
parameters for which independent information from interferometric radius
measurements is available. We used $\chi^2$ -based methods to determine
parameters from high-resolution spectroscopic observations. Our synthetic
spectra are based on the new PHOENIX grid that uses the ACES description for
the equation of state. This is a model generation expected to be especially
suitable for the low-temperature atmospheres. We identified suitable spectral
tracers of atmospheric parameters and determined the uncertainties in $T_{\rm
eff}$, $\log{g}$, and [Fe/H] resulting from degeneracies between parameters and
from shortcomings of the model atmospheres. The inherent uncertainties we find
are {\sigma}$T_{\rm eff}$= 35 K, {\sigma}$\log{g}$ = 0.14, and {\sigma}[Fe/H] =
0.11. The new model spectra achieve a reliable match to our observed data; our
results for $T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log{g}$ are consistent with literature values
to within 1{\sigma}. However, metallicities reported from earlier photometric
and spectroscopic calibrations in some cases disagree with our results by more
than 3 {\sigma}. A possible explanation are systematic errors in earlier
metallicity determinations that were based on insufficient descriptions of the
cool atmospheres. At this point, however, we cannot definitely identify the
reason for this discrepancy, but our analysis indicates that there is a large
uncertainty in the accuracy of M-dwarf parameter estimates.

two-dimensionally in the first few molecular layers near the dielectric
interface. Although the mobility of bulk organic semiconductors has increased
dramatically, direct probing of intrinsic charge transport in the
two-dimensional limit has not been possible due to excessive disorders and
traps in ultrathin organic thin films. Here, highly ordered mono- to
tetra-layer pentacene crystals are realized by van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy on
hexagonal BN. We find that the charge transport is dominated by hopping in the
first conductive layer, but transforms to band-like in subsequent layers. Such
abrupt phase transition is attributed to strong modulation of the molecular
packing by interfacial vdW interactions, as corroborated by quantitative
structural characterization and density functional theory calculations. The
structural modulation becomes negligible beyond the second conductive layer,
leading to a mobility saturation thickness of only ~3nm. Highly ordered organic
ultrathin films provide a platform for new physics and device structures (such
as heterostructures and quantum wells) that are not possible in conventional

finder charts and by searching in proper motion catalogues. Final proper
motions were measured by involving positional measurements from up to eleven
surveys. Spectral types of red CPM companions were estimated from their
absolute $J$-band magnitudes based on the Hipparcos distances of the primaries.
RESULTS: In addition to about 100 known CPM objects, we found 19 new CPM
companions and confirmed 31 previously known candidates. A few CPM objects are
still considered as candidates according to their level of proper motion
agreement. Among the new objects there are nine M0-M4, eight M5-M6, one

confirmed two K, 19 M0-M4, six M5-M6, two early-L dwarfs, and two DA WDs as CPM
companions. In a few cases, previous spectral types were available that all
agree well with our estimates. Two companions (HD 22879B and HD 49933B) are
associated with moderately metal-poor Gaia benchmark stars. One doubtful CPM

a very good fit to the observed evolution of rotational periods for solar-type

fast rotators experience a stronger coupling between their radiative region and
the convective envelope. Regardless of the set of prescriptions, however, we
cannot simultaneously reproduce surface angular velocity and the internal

evolved objects in the Magellanic Clouds. These objects have dust excesses,
stellar parameters, and spectral energy distributions similar to those of dusty
post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars. However, they have lower
luminosities and hence lower masses. We suggest that they have evolved off the
red giant branch (RGB) instead of the AGB as a result of binary interaction.
Aims: In this study we aim to place these objects in an evolutionary context
and establish an evolutionary connection between RGB binaries (such as the
sequence E variables) and our new sample of objects. Methods: We compared the
theoretically predicted birthrates of the progeny of RGB binaries to the
observational birthrates of the new sample of objects. Results: We find that
there is order-of-magnitude agreement between the observed and predicted
birthrates of post-RGB stars. The sources of uncertainty in the birthrates are
discussed; the most important sources are probably the observational
incompleteness factor and the post-RGB evolution rates. We also note that
mergers are relatively common low on the RGB and that stars low on the RGB with
mid-IR excesses may recently have undergone a merger. Conclusions: Our sample
of dusty post-RGB stars most likely provides the first observational evidence
for a newly discovered phase in binary evolution: post-RGB binaries with
circumstellar dust.

a set of order-constrained messages to a set of users over independent erasure
channels. This paper studies the delivery time reduction problem using
instantly decodable network coding (IDNC). Motivated by time-critical and
order-constrained applications, the delivery time is defined, at each
transmission, as the number of undelivered messages. The delivery time
minimization problem being computationally intractable, most of the existing
literature on IDNC propose sub-optimal online solutions. This paper suggests a
novel method for solving the problem by introducing the delivery delay as a
measure of distance to optimality. An expression characterizing the delivery
time using the delivery delay is derived, allowing the approximation of the
delivery time minimization problem by an optimization problem involving the
delivery delay. The problem is, then, formulated as a maximum weight clique
selection problem over the IDNC graph wherein the weight of each vertex
reflects its corresponding user and message's delay. Simulation results suggest
that the proposed solution achieves lower delivery and completion times as
compared to the best-known heuristics for delivery time reduction.

show that the time complexity of the problem depends on the amount of stability
and connectivity of the dynamic network topology and on the adaptiveness of the
adversary providing the dynamic topology. More formally, we model communication
using the standard graph-based radio network model. To model the dynamic
network, we use a generalization of the synchronous dynamic graph model
introduced in [Kuhn et al., STOC 2010]. For integer parameters $T\geq 1$ and
$k\geq 1$, we call a dynamic graph $T$-interval $k$-connected if for every
interval of $T$ consecutive rounds, there exists a $k$-vertex-connected stable
subgraph. Further, for an integer parameter $\tau\geq 0$, we say that the
adversary providing the dynamic network is $\tau$-oblivious if for constructing
the graph of some round $t$, the adversary has access to all the randomness
(and states) of the algorithm up to round $t-\tau$.
  As our main result, we show that for any $T\geq 1$, any $k\geq 1$, and any
$\tau\geq 1$, for a $\tau$-oblivious adversary, there is a distributed
algorithm to broadcast a single message in time
$O\big(\big(1+\frac{n}{k\cdot\min\left\{\tau,T\right\}}\big)\cdot n\log^3
n\big)$. We further show that even for large interval $k$-connectivity,
efficient broadcast is not possible for the usual adaptive adversaries. For a
$1$-oblivious adversary, we show that even for any $T\leq
(n/k)^{1-\varepsilon}$ (for any constant $\varepsilon>0$) and for any $k\geq
1$, global broadcast in $T$-interval $k$-connected networks requires at least
$\Omega(n^2/(k^2\log n))$ time. Further, for a $0$ oblivious adversary,
broadcast cannot be solved in $T$-interval $k$-connected networks as long as
$T<n-k$.

diversity brought by each item relatively to a short sequence of consultations,
corresponding to the recent user history. Our model has a complexity in
constant time, and is generic since it can apply to any type of items within an
online service (e.g. profiles, products, music tracks) and any application
domain (e-commerce, social network, music streaming), as long as we have
partial item descriptions. The observation of the diversity level over time
allows us to detect implicit changes. In the long term, we plan to characterize
the context, i.e. to find common features among a contiguous sub-sequence of
items between two changes of context determined by our model. This will allow
us to make context-aware and privacy-preserving recommendations, to explain
them to users. As this is an ongoing research, the first step consists here in
studying the robustness of our model while detecting changes of context. In
order to do so, we use a music corpus of 100 users and more than 210,000
consultations (number of songs played in the global history). We validate the
relevancy of our detections by finding connections between changes of context
and events, such as ends of session. Of course, these events are a subset of
the possible changes of context, since there might be several contexts within a
session. We altered the quality of our corpus in several manners, so as to test
the performances of our model when confronted with sparsity and different types

the liquid, the Poisson Boltzmann equation accounts for only half of the
electrical double layer, with the other half, the surface charge layer, being
beyond its computational domain. In this work, we take a holistic approach to
the charge separation phenomenon at the silica/water interface by treating,
within a single computational domain, the electrical double layer that
comprises both the mobile ions in the liquid and the surface charge density.
The Poisson Nernst Planck equations are used as the rigorous basis for our
methodology. The holistic approach has the advantage of being able to predict
surface charge variations that arise either from the addition of salt and acid
to the liquid, or from the decrease of the liquid channel width to below twice
the Debye length. As the electrical double layer must be overall neutral, we
use this constraint to derive both the form of the static limit of the Poisson
Nernst Planck equations, as well as a global chemical potential that replaces
the classical zeta potential as the boundary value for the PB equation, which
can be re-derived from our formalism. We present several predictions of our
theory that are beyond the framework of the PB equation alone, e.g., the
surface capacitance and the so-called pK and pL values, the isoelectronic point
at which the surface charge layer is neutralized, and the appearance of a
Donnan potential that arises from the formation of an electrical double layer
at the inlet regions of a nano-channel connected to the bulk reservoir. All
theory predictions are shown to be in good agreement with the experimental
observations.

been seen as oversimplified, and multiple improvements, refinements, and
alternatives to it have been suggested, it is still one of the major tools for
serious theoretical investigation of SETI issues. During these 50+ years,
several attempts at modifying or reforming the classification have been made;
we review some of them here, together with presenting some of the scenarios
which present difficulties to the standard version. Recent results in both
theoretical and observational SETI studies, especially the G-hat infrared
survey (2014-2015), have persuasively shown that the emphasis on detectability
inherent in Kardashev's classification obtains new significance and freshness.
Several new movements and conceptual frameworks, such as the Dysonian SETI,
tally extremely well with these developments. So, the apparent simplicity of
the classification is highly deceptive: Kardashev's work offers a wealth of
still insufficiently studied methodological and epistemological ramifications
and it remains, in both letter and spirit, perhaps the worthiest legacy of the
