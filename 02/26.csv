  Underload and Back",,,,,"cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Task replication has recently been advocated as a practical solution to
reduce latencies in parallel systems. In addition to several convincing
empirical studies, some others provide analytical results, yet under some
strong assumptions such as Poisson arrivals, exponential service times, or
independent service times of the replicas themselves, which may lend themselves
to some contrasting and perhaps contriving behavior. For instance, under the
second assumption, an overloaded system can be stabilized by a replication
factor, but can be sent back in overload through further replication. In turn,
under the third assumption, strictly larger stability regions of replication
systems do not necessarily imply smaller delays.
  Motivated by the need to dispense with such common and restricting
assumptions, which may additionally cause unexpected behavior, we develop a
unified and general theoretical framework to compute tight bounds on the
distribution of response times in general replication systems. These results
immediately lend themselves to the optimal number of replicas minimizing
response time quantiles, depending on the parameters of the system (e.g., the
degree of correlation amongst replicas). As a concrete application of our
framework, we design a novel replication policy which can improve the stability
region of classical fork-join queueing systems by $\mathcal{O}(\ln K)$, in the
number of servers $K$.

computing reliable information about student performance in massive open online
courses. The idea is to outsource the grading task to the students themselves
as follows. After the end of an exam, each student is asked to rank -- in terms
of quality -- a bundle of exam papers by fellow students. An aggregation rule
then combines the individual rankings into a global one that contains all
students. We define a broad class of simple aggregation rules, which we call
type-ordering aggregation rules, and present a theoretical framework for
assessing their effectiveness. When statistical information about the grading
behaviour of students is available (in terms of a noise matrix that
characterizes the grading behaviour of the average student from a student
population), the framework can be used to compute the optimal rule from this
class with respect to a series of performance objectives that compare the
ranking returned by the aggregation rule to the underlying ground truth
ranking. For example, a natural rule known as Borda is proved to be optimal
when students grade correctly. In addition, we present extensive simulations
that validate our theory and prove it to be extremely accurate in predicting
the performance of aggregation rules even when only rough information about
grading behaviour (i.e., an approximation of the noise matrix) is available.
Both in the application of our theoretical framework and in our simulations, we
exploit data about grading behaviour of students that have been extracted from
two field experiments in the University of Patras.

on orbital character rather than on the position on the Fermi Surface (for

salient feature, which proved robust against all the ARPES caveats we could

decompositions of the products and good homological and arithmetical properties
of the associated multi-Rees algebras. The following families will be discussed
in detail: polymatroidal ideals, ideals generated by linear forms and Borel
fixed ideals of maximal minors. The main tools are Gr\""obner bases and Sagbi

written with a one-node-per-thread strategy are competitive for polynomial

the baryon production at colliders. The analysis of data on hyperon transverse
momentum distributions,dN/dp_t, demonstrates a difference in the dynamics of
multiparticle production in proton-proton vs. antiproton-proton collisions in
the region of low p_t . The most important contribution in antip-p reaction
goes from fragmentation of antidiquark-diquark side of pomeron diagram. The
complete study of the energy dependence of average transverse momenta for the
energies from sqrt(s)= 0.2 to 7. TeV shows the slight growing of <p_t> with
energy. No dramatic changes were seen on the range from Tevatron to LHC, which
may be responsible for ""knee"" in the cosmic ray proton spectra. The average
transverse momentum analysis through the different mass of hadrons reveals some
regularity in the mass gaps between the hadron generations. This observation
suggests that more hadrons with the following masses 13.7, 37.3, 101.5, 276,
750 ... GeV are expected by geometrical progression with the mass factor of
order $\delta{lnM}$=1 . These states may possess new quantum numbers beyond the

the whole range of x_F gives obvious advantages in the description of
production asymmetries: the baryon-over-antibaryon access in the central region
of proton-proton collisions, the baryon-to-meson abnormal ratios in
nucleus-nucleus reactions, the growing ratios of secondary particles in cosmic
ray spectra as well as the recently observed negative asymmetry for charmed
baryon/antibaryon spectra at the far rapidity point Y=2 in LHCb experiment.
This study, based on the routine analysis of collider data, has many crucial

(S/N $\approx$ 400 - 650 per pixel) of HIP 100963 and the Sun for a
differential abundance analysis. We measured the equivalent widths (EWs) of
iron lines to determine the stellar parameters by employing the differential
spectroscopic equilibrium. We determined the composition of volatile,
refractory, and neutron-capture elements through a differential abundance
analysis with respect to the Sun.
  Results. The stellar parameters we found are $T_{\rm{eff}}=5818 \pm 4$ K, log
$g = 4.49 \pm 0.01$ dex, $v_{t} = 1.03 \pm 0.01 $ $\rm{km\ {s}}^{-1}$ , and
[Fe/H] $ = -\ 0.003 \pm 0.004$ dex. These low errors allow us to compute a
precise mass ($1.03^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ M$_{\odot}$) and age (2.0 $\pm$ 0.4 Gyr),
obtained using Yonsei-Yale isochrones. Using our [Y/Mg] ratio, we have
determined an age of $2.1 \pm 0.4$ Gyr, in agreement with the age computed
using isochrones. Our isochronal age also agrees with the age determined from
stellar activity (2.4 $\pm$ 0.3 Gyr). We study the abundance pattern with
condensation temperature ($\rm{T_{cond}}$) taking corrections by the GCE into
account. We show that the enhancements of neutron-capture elements are
explained by contributions from both the $s$- and $r$-process. The lithium
abundance follows the tight Li-age correlation seen in other solar twins.
  Conclusions. We confirm that HIP 100963 is a solar twin and demonstrate that
its abundance pattern is about solar after corrections for GCE. The star also
shows enrichment in $s-$ and $r$-process elements, as well as depletion in
lithium that is caused by stellar evolution.

a large variety of tasks. However, in practice different task environments are
best handled by different learning models, rather than a single, universal,
approach. Most non-trivial models thus require the adjustment of several to
many learning parameters, which is often done on a case-by-case basis by an
external party. Meta-learning refers to the ability of an agent to autonomously
and dynamically adjust its own learning parameters, or meta-parameters. In this
work we show how projective simulation, a recently developed model of
artificial intelligence, can naturally be extended to account for meta-learning
in reinforcement learning settings. The projective simulation approach is based
on a random walk process over a network of clips. The suggested meta-learning
scheme builds upon the same design and employs clip networks to monitor the
agent's performance and to adjust its meta-parameters ""on the fly"". We
distinguish between ""reflexive adaptation"" and ""adaptation through learning"",
and show the utility of both approaches. In addition, a trade-off between
flexibility and learning-time is addressed. The extended model is examined on
three different kinds of reinforcement learning tasks, in which the agent has
different optimal values of the meta-parameters, and is shown to perform well,

private most-preferred points on a metric space are assigned to facilities that

is to produce such an assignment that minimizes the social cost, i.e., the
total distance between the most-preferred points of the agents and their
corresponding facilities in the assignment, under the constraint of
truthfulness, which ensures that agents do not misreport their most-preferred

  We propose a resource augmentation framework, where a truthful mechanism is
evaluated by its worst-case performance on an instance with enhanced facility
capacities against the optimal mechanism on the same instance with the original
capacities. We study a very well-known mechanism, Serial Dictatorship, and
provide an exact analysis of its performance. Although Serial Dictatorship is a
purely combinatorial mechanism, our analysis uses linear programming; a linear
program expresses its greedy nature as well as the structure of the input, and
finds the input instance that enforces the mechanism have its worst-case
performance. Bounding the objective of the linear program using duality
arguments allows us to compute tight bounds on the approximation ratio. Among
other results, we prove that Serial Dictatorship has approximation ratio
$g/(g-2)$ when the capacities are multiplied by any integer $g \geq 3$. Our
results suggest that even a limited augmentation of the resources can have
wondrous effects on the performance of the mechanism and in particular, the
approximation ratio goes to 1 as the augmentation factor becomes large. We
complement our results with bounds on the approximation ratio of Random Serial

randomly-interacting agents with little computational power cooperate to
jointly perform computational tasks. Inspired by developments in molecular
computation, and in particular DNA computing, recent algorithmic work has
focused on the complexity of solving simple yet fundamental tasks in the
population model, such as leader election (which requires stabilization to a
single agent in a special ""leader"" state), and majority (in which agents must
stabilize to a decision as to which of two possible initial states had higher
initial count). Known results point towards an inherent trade-off between the
time complexity of such algorithms, and the space complexity, i.e. size of the
memory available to each agent.
  In this paper, we explore this trade-off and provide new upper and lower
bounds for majority and leader election. First, we prove a unified lower bound,
which relates the space available per node with the time complexity achievable
by a protocol: for instance, our result implies that any protocol solving
either of these tasks for $n$ agents using $O( \log \log n )$ states must take
$\Omega( n / \rm{polylog} n )$ expected time. This is the first result to
characterize time complexity for protocols which employ super-constant number
of states per node, and proves that fast, poly-logarithmic running times
require protocols to have relatively large space costs.
  On the positive side, we give algorithms showing that fast, poly-logarithmic
stabilization time can be achieved using $O( \log^2 n )$ space per node, in the
case of both tasks. Overall, our results highlight a time complexity separation
between $O(\log \log n)$ and $\Theta( \log^2 n )$ state space size for both
majority and leader election in population protocols, and introduce new
techniques, which should be applicable more broadly.

suppresses high momentum modes can be employed, in practice artifacts are
inevitable in current power counting schemes. Artifacts from particular
regulators may cause significant distortions of the physics or may affect
many-body convergence rates, so understanding their nature is important. Here
we characterize the differences between cutoff effects using uniform matter at

Understanding how to quantify and manipulate it also promises to have
applications for a diverse set of problems in theoretical physics. For certain
applications, however, one requires coherence between the eigenspaces of
specific physical observables, such as energy, angular momentum, or photon
number, and it makes a difference which eigenspaces appear in the
superposition. For others, there is a preferred set of subspaces relative to
which coherence is deemed a resource, but it is irrelevant which of the
subspaces appear in the superposition. We term these two types of coherence
unspeakable and speakable respectively. We argue that a useful approach to
quantifying and characterizing unspeakable coherence is provided by the
resource theory of asymmetry when the symmetry group is a group of
translations, and we translate a number of prior results on asymmetry into the
language of coherence. We also highlight some of the applications of this
approach, for instance, in the context of quantum metrology, quantum speed
limits, quantum thermodynamics, and NMR. The question of how best to treat
speakable coherence as a resource is also considered. We review a popular
approach in terms of operations that preserve the set of incoherent states,
propose an alternative approach in terms of operations that are covariant under
dephasing, and we outline the challenge of providing a physical justification
for either approach. Finally, we note some mathematical connections that hold
among the different approaches to quantifying coherence.

from a polar coronal hole-type region surrounded by a magnetosphere in the

on initial analytical solutions. We adopt a meridionally self-similar solution
of the time-independent and axisymmetric MHD equations which describes
effectively a jet originating from the corona of a star. We modify
appropriately this solution in order to incorporate a physically consistent
stellar magnetosphere. We find that the closed fieldline region may exhibit
different behaviour depending on the associated boundary conditions and the
distribution of the heat flux. However, the stellar jet in all final
equilibrium states is very similar to the analytical one prescribed in the
initial conditions. When the initial net heat flux is maintained, the
magnetosphere takes the form of a dynamical helmet streamer with a quasi steady
state slow magnetospheric wind. With no heat flux, a small dead zone forms
around the equator, surrounded by a weak streamer, source of a low mass flux
magnetospheric ejection. An equilibrium with no streamer and a helmet shaped
dead zone is found when the coronal hole is larger and extends up to a reduced
closed fieldline static zone. The study demonstrates the robustness of
self-similar solutions and their ability to provide quasi-steady jet
simulations with realistic boundaries and surrounded by equatorial
magnetospheres.

admits a Hopf algebra symmetry which is a quantum group deformation of the
SU(3) part of the R-symmetry of the Ncal=4 theory. We investigate how this
quantum symmetry might be expressed on the gravity side of the AdS/CFT
correspondence. First, we discuss the twist leading to the Hopf algebra
structure for the well-known beta-deformation as well as a unitarily equivalent
theory that we call the w-deformation. We then show how this Hopf twist can be
used to define a star product between the three scalar superfields of these
theories which encodes the deformed global symmetry. Turning to the gravity
side, we adapt this star product to deform the pure spinors of six-dimensional
flat space in its generalised geometry description. This leads to an N=2 NS-NS
solution of IIB supergravity. Starting from this precursor solution, adding
D3-branes and taking the near-horizon limit reproduces the dual gravitational
solution to the above theories, first derived by Lunin and Maldacena using TsT
techniques. This indicates that the Hopf algebra symmetry can play a useful
role in constructing the supergravity duals of the general Leigh-Strassler
deformations.

which share a similar connectivity pattern. Existing algorithms for community
detection assume the knowledge of the number of clusters or estimate it a
priori using various selection criteria and subsequently estimate the community

clustering, particularly when the community structure is vague. We instead
propose a coherent probabilistic framework for simultaneous estimation of the
number of communities and the community structure, adapting recently developed
Bayesian nonparametric techniques to network models. An efficient Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is proposed which obviates the need to perform
reversible jump MCMC on the number of clusters. The methodology is shown to
outperform recently developed community detection algorithms in a variety of
synthetic data examples and in benchmark real-datasets. Using an appropriate
metric on the space of all configurations, we develop non-asymptotic Bayes risk
bounds even when the number of clusters is unknown. Enroute, we develop
concentration properties of non-linear functions of Bernoulli random variables,
which may be of independent interest.

that no voter should be worse off by joining an electorate. A seminal result in
social choice theory by Moulin (1998) has shown that Condorcet-consistency and
participation are incompatible whenever there are at least 4 alternatives and
25 voters. We leverage SAT solving to obtain an elegant human-readable proof of
Moulin's result that requires only 12 voters. Moreover, the SAT solver is able
to construct a Condorcet-consistent voting rule that satisfies participation as

the receiver calibration measurements to the antenna temperature using a Monte

modeling foreground subtraction from a fiducial temperature spectrum using a
five-term polynomial. Most of the calibration uncertainties yield residuals of
$1$~mK or less at $95\%$ confidence. However, current uncertainties in the
antenna and receiver reflection coefficients can lead to residuals of up to
$20$ mK even in low-foreground sky regions. These dominant residuals could be
reduced by 1) improving the accuracy in reflection measurements, especially
their phase 2) improving the impedance match at the antenna-receiver interface,
and 3) decreasing the changes with frequency of the antenna reflection phase.

QPOs, often occurring in a near 3:2 frequency ratio, to the breathing and
vertical epicyclic frequency modes of the hot, thick flow, although we can not
rule out the Keplerian and m=-1 radial epicyclic modes. In either case, the

the fact that all three frequencies are associated with the same geometrical
structure. While the exact QPO frequencies are sensitive to the black hole mass
and spin, their evolution over the course of an outburst is mainly tied to the
truncation radius between the geometrically thin, optically thick disk and the
inner, hot flow. We show that, in the case of the LMXB GRO J1655-40, this model
can explain the one simultaneous observation of all three QPOs and that an
extrapolation of the model appears to match lower frequency observations where

the afterglow and constrain the isotropic energy of the explosion to be a few
$10^{50}$ erg, comparable to that of a short duration GRB. The outflow may have
a jet opening angle of $\sim 0.22$ rad, so that the beaming-corrected energy is
below $10^{49}$ erg. The results rule out most FRB progenitor models for this
FRB, but may be consistent with either of the following two scenarios. The
first scenario invokes a merger of an NS-NS binary, which produced an
undetected short GRB and a supra-massive neutron star, which subsequently
collapsed into a black hole, probably 100s of seconds after the short GRB. The
second scenario invokes a merger of a compact star binary (BH-BH, NS-NS, or
BH-NS) system whose pre-merger dynamical magnetospheric activities made the
FRB, which is followed by an undetected short GRB-like transient. The
gravitational wave (GW) event GW150914 would be a sister of FRB 150418 in this

This resolution constraint prohibits simulating large volumes, such as those

limitation, we present Iteratively Matched Statistics (IMS), a novel method to
accurately model the Lyman-alpha forest with collisionless N-body simulations,
where the relevant density fluctuations are unresolved. We use a small-box,
high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation to obtain the probability distribution

an N-body simulation, which we construct from the matter density. We
demonstrate that our method can perfectly reproduce line-of-sight observables,

spectrum (5-20%). We quantify the performance of the commonly used Gaussian
smoothing technique and show that it has significantly lower accuracy (20-80%),
especially for N-body simulations with achievable mean inter-particle
separations in large-volume simulations. In addition, we show that IMS produces
reasonable and smooth spectra, making it a powerful tool for modeling the IGM

skew to low mass BGGs at all redshifts implying the presence of a star-forming
population of the BGGs with $ M_S\sim10^{10.5} M_{\odot} $ which results in the

agreement with models and previous studies, we find that the mean stellar mass
of BGGs grows with time by a factor of $\sim2$ between $z=1.3$ to $z=0.1$,
however, the significant growth occurs above $ z=0.4$. The BGGs are not
entirely a dormant population of galaxies, as low mass BGGs in low mass halos
are more active in forming stars than the BGGs in more massive halos, over the
same redshift range. We find that the average SFR of the BGGs evolves steeply

unpredictable scales. In astroparticle physics, this has so far not been
possible, since most of the observables were calculated at Born level only, so
that the renormalization scheme and scale dependence could not be studied in a
meaningful way. In this paper, we present the first quantitative study of the
theoretical uncertainty of the neutralino dark matter relic density from scheme
and scale variations. We first explain in detail how the renormalization scale
enters the tree-level calculations through coupling constants, masses and
mixing angles. We then demonstrate a reduction of the renormalization scale
dependence through one-loop SUSY-QCD corrections in many different dark matter
annihilation channels and enhanced perturbative stability of a mixed
on-shell/$\bar{\rm DR}$ renormalization scheme over a pure $\bar{\rm DR}$
scheme in the top-quark sector. In the stop-stop annihilation channel, the
Sommerfeld enhancement and its scale dependence are shown to be of particular
importance. Finally, the impact of our higher-order SUSY-QCD corrections and
their scale uncertainties are studied in three typical scenarios of the
phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with eleven parameters

exciting opportunities available with near-term cosmological datasets. Two
quantities that are sensitive to neutrino mass, scale-dependent halo bias
$b(k)$ and the linear growth parameter $f(k)$ inferred from redshift-space
distortions, can be measured without cosmic variance. Unlike the amplitude of
the matter power spectrum, which always has a finite error, the error on $b(k)$
and $f(k)$ continues to decrease as the number density of tracers increases.
This paper presents forecasts for statistics of galaxy and lensing fields that
are sensitive to neutrino mass via $b(k)$ and $f(k)$. The constraints on
neutrino mass from the auto- and cross-power spectra of spectroscopic and
photometric galaxy samples are weakened by scale-dependent bias unless a very
high density of tracers is available. In the high density limit, using multiple
tracers allows cosmic-variance to be beaten and the forecasted errors on
neutrino mass shrink dramatically. In practice, beating the cosmic variance
errors on neutrino mass with $b(k)$ will be a challenge, but this signal is
nevertheless a new probe of neutrino effects on structure formation that is
interesting in its own right.

decision makers and alternatives are embedded in d-dimensional Euclidean space.
Decision makers prefer those alternatives closer to them. This model, also
known as multidimensional unfolding, has applications in economics,
psychometrics, marketing, and many other fields. We study the problem of
deciding whether a given preference profile is d-Euclidean. For the
one-dimensional case, polynomial-time algorithms are known. We show that, in
contrast, for every other fixed dimension d > 1, the recognition problem is
equivalent to the existential theory of the reals (ETR), and so in particular
NP-hard. We further show that some Euclidean preference profiles require
exponentially many bits in order to specify any Euclidean embedding, and prove
that the domain of d-Euclidean preferences does not admit a finite forbidden
minor characterisation for any d > 1. We also study dichotomous preferencesand
the behaviour of other metrics, and survey a variety of related work.

Although fairly weak, it is the first gamma-ray burst detected by the

(LLE) events covering the 30-00 MeV band. We find evidence of an additional
component above the main emission peak (modelled using a Band function) with a

fitted by a Planck function, but shows unusual behaviour: the peak energy
increases in the prompt emission phase, reaching energies of several MeV. This
is the first time such a trend has been seen, and implies that the origin of
this component is different from those previously detected. We suggest that the
two spectral components likely arise in different regions of the outflow, and
that strong constraints can be achieved by assuming one of them originates from

accepted techniques used for damage identification in structures. FEMU can be
formulated as a numerical optimization problem and solved iteratively making
automatic updating of the uncertain model parameters by minimizing the
difference between measured and analytical structural properties. However, in
the presence of noise in the measurements, the updating results are usually
prone to errors. This is mathematically described as instability of the damage
identification as an inverse problem. One way to resolve this problem is by
using regularization. In this paper we investigate regularization methods based
on the minimization of the total variation of the uncertain model parameters
and compare this solution with a rather frequently used regularization based on
an interpolation technique. For well-localized damages the results show a clear
advantage of the proposed solution in terms of the identified location and
severity of damage compared with the interpolation based solution.
  For a practical test of the proposed method we use a reinforced concrete
plate. Measurements and analysis were repeated first on an undamaged plate, and
then after applying four different degrees of damage.

used to produce a sequence of air highways that minimizes the cost of flying

better controle on the boundary than in the bulk. To avoid unbounded particle
production across the bounce it is necessary to smooth out the curvature

The task is to assign the mobile terminals to the base stations such that the
total squared distance from each terminal to its assigned base station is
minimized and the capacity constraints are satisfied. This paper focuses on the
development of \emph{distributed} and computationally efficient algorithms that
adapt to the motion of both terminals and base stations. Suggested by the
optimal transportation theory, we exploit the structural property of the
optimal solution, which can be represented by a power diagram on the base
stations such that the total usage of nodes within each power cell equals the
capacity of the corresponding base station. We show by using the kinetic data
structure framework the first analytical upper bound on the number of changes
in the optimal solution, i.e., its stability. On the algorithm side, using the
power diagram formulation we show that the solution can be represented in size
proportional to the number of base stations and can be solved by an iterative,
local algorithm. In particular, this algorithm can naturally exploit the
continuity of motion and has orders of magnitude faster than existing solutions
using min-cost matching and linear programming, and thus is able to handle
large scale data under mobility.

  Complexity in the LOCAL Model",,,,,"cs.CC cs.DC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the past 30 years numerous algorithms have been designed for symmetry
breaking problems in the LOCAL model, such as maximal matching, MIS, vertex
coloring, and edge-coloring. For most problems the best randomized algorithm is
at least exponentially faster than the best deterministic algorithm. In this
paper we prove that these exponential gaps are necessary and establish
connections between the deterministic and randomized complexities in the LOCAL
model. Each result has a very compelling take-away message:
  1. Fast $\Delta$-coloring of trees requires random bits: Building on the
recent lower bounds of Brandt et al., we prove that the randomized complexity
of $\Delta$-coloring a tree with maximum degree $\Delta\ge 55$ is
$\Theta(\log_\Delta\log n)$, whereas its deterministic complexity is
$\Theta(\log_\Delta n)$ for any $\Delta\ge 3$. This also establishes a large
separation between the deterministic complexity of $\Delta$-coloring and
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring trees.
  2. Randomized lower bounds imply deterministic lower bounds: We prove that
any deterministic algorithm for a natural class of problems that runs in
$O(1)+o(\log_\Delta n)$ rounds can be transformed to run in
$O(\log^*n-\log^*\Delta+1)$ rounds. If the transformed algorithm violates a
lower bound (even allowing randomization), then one can conclude that the
problem requires $\Omega(\log_\Delta n)$ time deterministically.
  3. Deterministic lower bounds imply randomized lower bounds: We prove that
the randomized complexity of any natural problem on instances of size $n$ is at
least its deterministic complexity on instances of size $\sqrt{\log n}$. This
shows that a deterministic $\Omega(\log_\Delta n)$ lower bound for any problem
implies a randomized $\Omega(\log_\Delta\log n)$ lower bound. It also
illustrates that the graph shattering technique is absolutely essential to the
LOCAL model.

results within errors, suggesting that the counts derived from

could be field-to-field variation due to the small survey area. By using the
best-fit function of the number counts, we find that ~40% of the extragalactic

open magnetic field and a current sheet at the equator atop the closed region.
We show that the large-scale shock-field configuration, especially the relative
curvature of the shock and the magnetic field line across which the shock is
sweeping, plays an important role in the efficiency of electron acceleration.
At low shock altitudes, when the shock curvature is larger than that of
magnetic field lines, the electrons are mainly accelerated at the shock flanks;
at higher altitudes, when the shock curvature is smaller, the electrons are
mainly accelerated at the shock nose around the top of closed field lines. The
above process reveals the shift of efficient electron acceleration region along
the shock front during its propagation. It is also found that in general the
electron acceleration at the shock flank is not so efficient as that at the top
of closed field since at the top a collapsing magnetic trap can be formed. In
addition, we find that the energy spectra of electrons is power-law like, first

with the theoretical value R ln(2S + 1) for S = 3/2 of the Cr3+ ion. Based on
the mean-field theory, the magnetic exchange constants J1 and Jc corresponding
to the interactions of the intralayer and between layers are about 0.143 meV
and -0.955 meV are obtained based on the fitting of the susceptibility above
TN, which agree with the results obtained from the ESR measurements. With the
help of the strain for tuning the magnetic properties, monolayer CrPS4 may be a
promising candidate to explore 2D magnetic semiconductors.

lensing. In graphene, the linear dispersion and zero-gap bandstructure admit
highly transparent pn junctions by simple electrostatic gating, which cannot be
achieved in conventional semiconductors. Moreover ballistic transport over
micron length scales at ambient temperature has been realized, providing an
ideal platform to realize a new generation of device based on electron lensing.
Robust demonstration of these effects, however, has not been forthcoming. Here
we employ transverse magnetic focusing to probe propagation across an
electrostatically defined graphene junction. We find perfect agreement with the
predicted Snells law for electrons, including observation of both positive and
negative refraction. Resonant transmission across the pn junction provides a
direct measurement of the angle dependent transmission coefficient, and we

that no likelihood-based method can produce a correct pedigree inference with

  In this paper we present the first discussion of multiple typed individuals

we give an example having data for multiple individuals.
  Additionally, deeper understanding of the general discrete structures driving

guide algorithms that wish to examine only identifiable pedigrees. This paper
introduces a general criteria for establishing whether a pair of pedigrees is
non-identifiable and two easy-to-compute criteria guaranteeing identifiability.
Finally, we suggest a method for dealing with non-identifiable likelihoods: use

spin systems with $O(n)$ symmetry and then take the large-$n$ limit to reduce
the system to the spherical model. The exact solution to the resulting
spherical model with long-range interactions along the imaginary-time axis
shows a phase transition with static critical exponents coinciding with those
of the conventional short-range spherical model in $d+2$ dimensions, where $d$
is the spatial dimensionality of the original quantum system. This implies the
dynamical exponent to be $z=2$. These conclusions are consistent with the
results of Monte Carlo simulations and renormalization group calculations for
dissipative transverse-field Ising and $O(n)$ models in one and two dimensions.
The present approach therefore serves as a useful tool to analytically
investigate the properties of quantum phase transitions of the dissipative

complex datasets. These architectures require giant matrix multiplication
operations to train millions of parameters. Conversely, there is another
growing trend to bring deep learning to low-power, embedded devices. The matrix
operations, associated with both training and testing of deep networks, are
very expensive from a computational and energy standpoint. We present a novel
hashing based technique to drastically reduce the amount of computation needed
to train and test deep networks. Our approach combines recent ideas from
adaptive dropouts and randomized hashing for maximum inner product search to
select the nodes with the highest activation efficiently. Our new algorithm for
deep learning reduces the overall computational cost of forward and
back-propagation by operating on significantly fewer (sparse) nodes. As a
consequence, our algorithm uses only 5% of the total multiplications, while
keeping on average within 1% of the accuracy of the original model. A unique
property of the proposed hashing based back-propagation is that the updates are
always sparse. Due to the sparse gradient updates, our algorithm is ideally
suited for asynchronous and parallel training leading to near linear speedup
with increasing number of cores. We demonstrate the scalability and
sustainability (energy efficiency) of our proposed algorithm via rigorous
experimental evaluations on several real datasets.

polarization in the radial direction, making them difficult to distinguish,
although the scattering-induced polarization can switch to the azimuthal
direction if the incident radiation is beamed strongly enough in the radial
direction in the disk plane. Disk inclination affects the polarizations from
emission and scattering differently, especially on the major axis where, in the
edge-on limit, the former vanishes while the latter reaches a polarization
fraction as large as 1/3. The polarizations from the two competing mechanisms
tend to cancel each other on the major axis, producing two low polarization

tantalizing evidence for at least one such ""hole"" in NGC1333 IRAS4A1, whose

Ring-like or

described in terms of free energy, an average quantity, but it may also be
impacted by local fluctuating forces acting within these systems. The full
distribution of these forces can thus give us insights into mechanochemistry
beyond the predictive capability of thermodynamics. In this paper, we study the
force exerted by an inextensible semiflexible polymer constrained in a looped
state. By using a novel simulation method termed ""phase-space sampling"", we
generate the equilibrium distribution of chain conformations in both position
and momentum space. We compute the constraint forces between the two ends of
the loop in this chain ensemble using Lagrangian mechanics, and show that the
mean of these forces is equal to the thermodynamic force. By analyzing kinetic
and potential contributions to the forces, we find that the mean force acts in
the direction of increasing extension not because of bending stress, but in
spite of it. Furthermore, we obtain a distribution of constraint forces as a
function of chain length, extension, and stiffness. Notably, increasing contour
length decreases the average force, but the additional freedom allows
fluctuations in the constraint force to increase. The force distribution is
asymmetric and falls off less sharply than a Gaussian distribution. Our work
exemplifies a system where large-amplitude fluctuations occur in a way
unforeseen by a purely thermodynamic framework, and offers novel computational
tools useful for efficient, unbiased simulation of a constrained system.

atomic (Ag, Cs, Au, Fr, Lr) and valence ionization potential of molecular (HgH,

highly accurate results. Not only the relativistic effect, but also the effect
of electron correlation is crucial in these heavy atomic and molecular systems.
To justify the fact, we have taken two further approximations in the

The ""orbital period"" is a period of the orbit. The other is a ""degree period"".
It is observed when changing the degree of Chebyshev polynomials with a fixed

In this paper, we clarify completely both of them. The knowledge about them
enables us to efficiently solve degree decision problem of Chebyshev polynomial

problems do arise already in lower dimensions. For instance, we consider the
curve $\gamma(x)=(x,x^2(1+\phi(x)))$ and associated dilations
$\delta_t(x)=(tx_1,t^2x_2)$. If $\phi\equiv 0$, then the corresponding maximal
function is the maximal function along parabolas in the plane, which is very
well understood due to the work by Nagel-Riviere-Wainger and others. If
$\phi\neq 0$ and $\phi(x)=\mathcal{O}(x^m)$, $m\geq 1$, the problem was open

related to the Bourgain circular maximal function, which required deep ideas
and local smoothing estimates established by Mockenhaupt-Seeger-Sogge for
Fourier integral operators satisfying the so-called ""cinematic curvature""

in the interior in response to changing magnetic tilt in the corona. We find
that Alfven-sound resonance combined with the ponderomotive force produces
acoustic waves in the interior with sufficient energy to match sunquake

The most energetic sunquakes are produced when the coronal field is strong,

the situation in thermal counterflow, where the superfluid velocity $v_{\rm s}$
and normal-fluid velocity $v_{\rm n}$ flow in opposite directions, in coflow,
$v_{\rm s}$ and $v_{\rm n}$ flow in the same direction. Quantum turbulence in
thermal counterflow has been long studied theoretically and experimentally, and
its various features have been revealed.In recent years, an experiment on
quantum turbulence in coflow has been performed to observe different features
of thermal counterflow. By supposing that $v_{\rm s}$ is uniform and $v_{\rm
n}$ takes the Hagen-Poiseuille profile, which is different from the experiment
where $v_{\rm n}$ is thought to be turbulent, we calculate the coflow
turbulence. Vortices preferentially accumulate on the surface of a cylinder for
$v_{\rm s} \simeq v_{\rm n}$ by mutual friction; namely, the coflow turbulence
has an attractor. How strongly the vortices are attracted depends on the
temperature and velocity. The length of the vortices increases as the vortices
protruding from the cylindrical attractor continue to wrap around it. As the
vortices become dense on the attractor, they spread toward its interior by
their repulsive interaction. Then, the superfluid velocity profile induced by
the vortices gradually mimics the normal-fluid velocity profile. This is an
indication of velocity matching, which is an important feature of coflow
turbulence.

non-saturating magnetoresistance (XMR), which is the subject of intense
interest. This phenomenon is thought to arise from the combination of perfect
n-p charge compensation with low carrier densities in WTe2 and presumably
details of its band structure. Recently, ""spin texture"" induced by strong
spin-orbital coupling (SOC) has been observed in WTe2 by angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This provides a mechanism for protecting
backscattering for the states involved and thus was proposed to play an
important role in the XMR of WTe2. Here, based on our density functional
calculations for bulk WTe2, we found a strong Rashba spin-orbit effect in the
calculated band structure due to its non-centrosymmetric structure. This splits
bands and two-fold spin degeneracy of bands is lifted. A prominent Umklapp
interference pattern (a spectroscopic feature with involving reciprocal lattice
vectors) can be observed by scanning tunneling microscopic (STM) measurements
on WTe2 surface at 4.2 K. This differs distinctly from the surface atomic
structure demonstrated at 77 K. The energy dependence of Umklapp interference
shows a strong correspondence with densities of states integrated from ARPES
measurement, manifesting a fact that the bands are spin-split on the opposites
side of Gamma point. Spectroscopic survey reveals the ratio of electron/hole
asymmetry changes alternately with lateral locations along b axis, providing a
microscopic picture for double-carrier transport of semimetallic WTe2. The

  of Financial Bubbles","40 pages, 10 figures",,,,"q-fin.ST","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  We present a detailed methodological study of the application of the modified
profile likelihood method for the calibration of nonlinear financial models
characterised by a large number of parameters. We apply the general approach to
the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model of financial bubbles. This
model is particularly relevant because one of its parameters, the critical time
$t_c$ signalling the burst of the bubble, is arguably the target of choice for
dynamical risk management. However, previous calibrations of the LPPLS model
have shown that the estimation of $t_c$ is in general quite unstable. Here, we
provide a rigorous likelihood inference approach to determine $t_c$, which
takes into account the impact of the other nonlinear (so-called ""nuisance"")
parameters for the correct adjustment of the uncertainty on $t_c$. This
provides a rigorous interval estimation for the critical time, rather than a
point estimation in previous approaches. As a bonus, the interval estimations
can also be obtained for the nuisance parameters ($m,\omega$, damping), which
can be used to improve filtering of the calibration results. We show that the
use of the modified profile likelihood method dramatically reduces the number
of local extrema by constructing much simpler smoother log-likelihood
landscapes. The remaining distinct solutions can be interpreted as genuine
scenarios that unfold as the time of the analysis flows, which can be compared
directly via their likelihood ratio. Finally, we develop a multi-scale profile
likelihood analysis to visualize the structure of the financial data at
different scales (typically from 100 to 750 days). We test the methodology
successfully on synthetic price time series and on three well-known historical
financial bubbles.

a bound on the rate of onset of chaos, including a bound on the Lyapunov
exponent, $\lambda_L\leq 2\pi /\beta$. We harness this bound to constrain the
space of putative holographic CFTs and their would-be dual theories of AdS
gravity. First, by studying out-of-time-order four-point functions, we discuss
how $\lambda_L=2\pi/\beta$ in ordinary two-dimensional holographic CFTs is
related to properties of the OPE at strong coupling. We then rule out the
existence of unitary, sparse two-dimensional CFTs with large central charge and
a set of higher spin currents of bounded spin; this implies the inconsistency
of weakly coupled AdS$_3$ higher spin gravities without infinite towers of
gauge fields, such as the $SL(N)$ theories. This fits naturally with the
structure of higher-dimensional gravity, where finite towers of higher spin
fields lead to acausality. On the other hand, unitary CFTs with classical
$W_{\infty}[\lambda]$ symmetry, dual to 3D Vasiliev or hs[$\lambda$] higher
spin gravities, do not violate the chaos bound, instead exhibiting no chaos:
$\lambda_L=0$. Independently, we show that such theories violate unitarity for

In small networks, all base stations can typically jointly coordinate their

to the otherwise overwhelmingly high channel state information (CSI)
acquisition overhead. In this work, we provide a branch and bound algorithm for
finding the globally optimal base station clustering. The algorithm is mainly
intended for benchmarking existing suboptimal clustering schemes. We propose a
general model for the user throughputs, which only depends on the long-term CSI
statistics. The model assumes intracluster interference alignment and is able
to account for the CSI acquisition overhead. By enumerating a search tree using
a best-first search and pruning sub-trees in which the optimal solution
provably cannot be, the proposed method converges to the optimal solution. The
pruning is done using specifically derived bounds, which exploit some assumed
structure in the throughput model. It is empirically shown that the proposed
method has an average complexity which is orders of magnitude lower than that

realizations of a two-dimensional spin-1/2 square-lattice antiferromagnet.
Below T_N = 4.21 K, its weak interlayer couplings induce a 3D magnetic order,
strongly influenced by external magnetic fields and/or hydrostatic pressure.
Previous work, focusing on the [H, T] phase diagram, identified a spin-flop
transition, resulting in a field-tunable bicritical point. However, the
influence of external pressure has not been investigated yet. Here we explore
the extended [p, H, T] phase diagram of Cu(pz)2(ClO4)2 under pressures up to 12
kbar and magnetic fields up to 7.1 T, via magnetometry and 35Cl nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The application of magnetic fields
enhances T_XY , the crossover temperature from the Heisenberg to the XY model,
thus pointing to an enhancement of the effective anisotropy. The applied
pressure has an opposite effect [dT_N/dp = 0.050(8) K/kbar], as it modifies
marginally the interlayer couplings, but likely changes more significantly the
orbital reorientation and the square-lattice deformation. This results in a
remodeling of the effective Hamiltonian, whereby the field and pressure effects
compensate each other. Finally, by comparing the experimental data with
numerical simulations we estimate T_BKT, the temperature of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless topological transition and argue why it is
inaccessible in our case.

fully characterized by a vector of back-off rates and a conflict graph.
Further, for any achievable throughput vector $\vec \theta$ the existence of a
unique vector $\vec \nu(\vec \theta)$ of back-off rates that achieves this
throughput vector was proven. Although this unique vector can in principle be
computed iteratively, the required time complexity grows exponentially in the
network size, making this only feasible for small networks.
  In this paper, we present an explicit formula for the unique vector of
back-off rates $\vec \nu(\vec \theta)$ needed to achieve any achievable
throughput vector $\vec \theta$ provided that the network has a chordal
conflict graph. This class of networks contains a number of special cases of
interest such as (inhomogeneous) line networks and networks with an acyclic
conflict graph. Moreover, these back-off rates are such that the back-off rate
of a node only depends on its own target throughput and the target throughput
of its neighbors and can be determined in a distributed manner.
  We further indicate that back-off rates of this form cannot be obtained in
general for networks with non-chordal conflict graphs. For general conflict
graphs we nevertheless show how to adapt the back-off rates when a node is
added to the network when its interfering nodes form a clique in the conflict
graph. Finally, we introduce a distributed chordal approximation algorithm for
general conflict graphs which is shown (using numerical examples) to be more
accurate than the Bethe approximation.

In contrast to other definitions, it uses only properties of the environment
and the measurement outcomes, avoiding references to the `measurement' of the
central system's state in any basis. These definitions are consistent with the
usual laws of thermodynamics at all temperatures, while never requiring
complete projective measurement of the entire system. It is shown that the
back-action of measurement must be counted as work rather than heat to satisfy
the second law. Comparisons are made to stochastic Schr\""{o}dinger unravelling
and transition-probability based methods, many of which appear as particular
limits of the present model. These limits show that our total entropy
production is a lower bound on traditional definitions of heat that trace out
the measurement device. Examining the master equation approximation to the
process at finite measurement rates, we show that most interactions with the

induces gravitational wavelike disturbances which could have effects felt on

of the warp factor. Due to this warp factor, disturbances don't fade away

it is found that the effective Einstein 4D equations on an axially symmetric

projected 5D Weyl tensor and can act as a dark energy term. The propagation
equations to first order for the metric components and scalar-gauge fields

exhibits a unique rest point or three ones by employing the saddle-node
bifurcation, when strong coupling is applied in the system. Also the trivial
rest point shows transcritical bifurcation with one of the new rest points. The
asymptotic stability and possible Hopf and Bautin bifurcations of the trivial
rest point are studied by analyzing the corresponding characteristic equation.
Fold cycle, torus, fold-torus, and big homoclinic bifurcations of limit cycles,
together with $1:1$ and $1:4$ resonances are found. The delay-dependent

risk measure with an $\ell_2$ regularizer is carried out by analytical
calculation. The regularizer reins in the large sample fluctuations and the
concomitant divergent estimation error, and eliminates the phase transition
where this error would otherwise blow up. In the data-dominated region, where
the number $N$ of different assets in the portfolio is much less than the
length $T$ of the available time series, the regularizer plays a negligible
role even if its strength $\eta$ is large, while in the opposite limit, where
the size of samples is comparable to, or even smaller than the number of
assets, the optimum is almost entirely determined by the regularizer. We
construct the contour map of estimation error on the $N/T$ vs. $\eta$ plane and
find that for a given value of the estimation error the gain in $N/T$ due to
the regularizer can reach a factor of about 4 for a sufficiently strong
regularizer.

places each ball by probing $d > 1$ random bins and placing the ball in the
least loaded of them. With high probability, the maximum load under
$\mathsf{Greedy}[d]$ is exponentially lower than the result when balls are
placed uniformly randomly. V\""ocking showed that a slightly asymmetric variant,
$\mathsf{Left}[d]$, provides a further significant improvement. However, this

  Here, we present a fully decentralized and easy-to-implement algorithm called
$\mathsf{FirstDiff}[d]$ that combines the simplicity of $\mathsf{Greedy}[d]$

$\mathsf{FirstDiff}[d]$ is to probe until a different bin size from the first
observation is located, then place the ball. Although the number of probes
could be quite large for some of the balls, we show that
$\mathsf{FirstDiff}[d]$ requires only at most $d$ probes on average per ball

probes is no greater than either that of $\mathsf{Greedy}[d]$ or
$\mathsf{Left}[d]$. More importantly, we show that $\mathsf{FirstDiff}[d]$
closely matches the improved maximum load ensured by $\mathsf{Left}[d]$ in both
the standard and heavily-loaded settings. We further provide a tight lower
bound on the maximum load up to $O(\log \log \log n)$ terms. We additionally
give experimental data that $\mathsf{FirstDiff}[d]$ is indeed as good as

mechanically-powerful AGN are likely to drive turbulence in the central ICM

suspension flows, in the context of the affine solvent model known to capture
various aspects of the jamming transition. We show that an individual collision
changes significantly the velocity field on a characteristic volume
$\Omega_c\sim 1/\delta z$ that diverges as jamming is approached, where $\delta
z$ is the deficit in coordination number required to jam the system. Such an
event also affects the contact forces between particles on that same volume
$\Omega_c$, but this change is modest in relative terms, of order $f_{coll}\sim
\bar{f}^{0.8}$, where $\bar{f}$ is the typical contact force scale. We then
show that the requirement that coordination is stationary (such that a
collision has a finite probability to open one contact elsewhere in the system)
yields the scaling of the viscosity (or equivalently the viscous number) with
coordination deficit $\delta z$. The same scaling result was derived in
[E.~DeGiuli, G.~D\""uring, E.~Lerner, and M.~Wyart, Phys.~Rev.~E {\bf 91},
062206 (2015)] via different arguments making an additional assumption. The
present approach gives a mechanistic justification as to why the correct finite
size scaling volume behaves as $1/\delta z$, and can be used to recover a
marginality condition known to characterize the distributions of contact forces

inequalities (CKN), with two radial power law weights and exponents in a
subcritical range. We address the question of symmetry breaking: are the
optimal functions radially symmetric, or not ? Our intuition comes from a
weighted fast diffusion (WFD) flow: if symmetry holds, then an explicit entropy
- entropy production inequality which governs the intermediate asymptotics is
indeed equivalent to (CKN), and the self-similar profiles are optimal for
(CKN). We establish an explicit symmetry breaking condition by proving the
linear instability of the radial optimal functions for (CKN). Symmetry breaking
in (CKN) also has consequences on entropy - entropy production inequalities and
on the intermediate asymptotics for (WFD). Even when no symmetry holds in
(CKN), asymptotic rates of convergence of the solutions to (WFD) are determined
by a weighted Hardy-Poincar{\'e} inequality which is interpreted as a
linearized entropy - entropy production inequality. All our results rely on the
study of the bottom of the spectrum of the linearized diffusion operator around
the self-similar profiles, which is equivalent to the linearization of (CKN)
around the radial optimal functions, and on variational methods. Consequences
for the (WFD) flow will be studied in Part II of this work.

overlap with each other not only at an initial time but also at later times

the matrix element of the bosonic field operator between the quantum states has
exactly the same profiles of the square amplitude and the phase as the

together for a long period of time. We suggest that the corresponding

layers is preventing them from fracturing. This paper examines how the drying
rate of colloidal liquids influences the particle packing at the nanoscale in
correlation with the crack patterns observed at the macroscale. Increasing the
drying rate results in more ordered, denser solid structures, and the dried
samples have more cracks.Yet, introducing a holding period (at a prescribed
point) during the drying protocol results in a more disordered solid structure
with significantly less cracks. To interpret these observations, this paper
conjectures that a longer drying protocol favors the formation of aggregates.
It is further argued that the number and size of the aggregates increase as the
drying rate decreases. This results in the formation of a more disordered,
porous film from the viewpoint of the particle packing, and a more resistant
film, i.e. less cracks, from the macroscale viewpoint.

simultaneously enable congruent multiferroic clusters (MFC) to emerge from

exceptionally large direct and converse magnetoelectric coupling coefficients,

Aiming at query optimization, Litak et al. [12] initiated the study of the

of the duality theory developed in [16]. The contributions of this paper are as
follows. Let A be a set of column's names and D be a set of cell values; we
characterize the dual space of the relational lattice R(D, A) by means of a
generalized ultrametric space, whose elements are the functions from A to D,
with the P (A)-valued distance being the Hamming one but lifted to subsets of
A. We use the dual space to present an equational axiomatization of these
lattices that reflects the combinatorial properties of these generalized
ultrametric spaces: symmetry and pairwise completeness. Finally, we argue that
these equations correspond to combinatorial properties of the dual spaces of
lattices, in a technical sense analogous of correspondence theory in modal
logic. In particular, this leads to an exact characterization of the finite
lattices satisfying these equations.

mucosa, the soft tissue in and around the mouth. Hence mucositis is a serious
common side effect and is a condition characterized by pain and inflammation of
the surface of the mucosa. Although the mucosa recovers during breaks of and
following the radiotherapy course the recovery will depend on the type of
tissue involved and on its location. We present a novel flexible multivariate
random effects proportional odds model which takes account of the longitudinal
course of oral mucositis at different mouth sites and of the radiation dosage
(in terms of cumulative dose). The model is an extension of the {\em
proportional odds model} which is used for ordinal response variables. Our
model includes the ordinal multivariate response of the mucositis score by
location, random intercepts for individuals and includes a non-linear function
of cumulative radiation dose. The model allows to test whether sensitivity
differs by mouth sites after having adjusted for site specific cumulative
radiation dose. The model also allows to check whether and how the (non-linear)
effect of site specific dose differs by site. We fit the model to longitudinal
patient data from a prospective observation and find that after adjusting for
cumulative dose, upper, lower lips and mouth floor are associated with the
lowest mucositis scores and hard and soft palate are associated with the
highest mucositis scores. This implies the possibility that tissues at
different mouth locations differ in their sensitivity to the toxic effect of
radiation. We also find that cumulative dose followed by mouth site are the
strongest predictors of mucositis, and the effects of age and gender are
negligible.

high-energy gamma rays by Fermi-LAT with a hard spectrum. At VHE, it was first
detected by VERITAS and later confirmed by MAGIC. Its spectral energy
distribution is highly attenuated at VHE gamma rays, which is coherent with
distant sources. Several estimations enabled the redshift to be constrained to
the range 0.6 < z < 1.3. These results place PKS 1424+240 in the very
interesting condition of being probably the most distant blazar that has been
detected at VHE. The ambiguity in the redshift is still large enough to prevent
precise studies of the EBL and the intrinsic blazar spectrum. Given the
difficulty of measuring spectroscopic redshifts for BL-Lac objects directly, we
aim to establish a reliable redshift value for this blazar by finding its host
group of galaxies. Elliptical galaxies are associated with groups, and BL-Lac
objects are typically hosted by them, so we decided to search for the host
group of the blazar. For this, we performed optical spectroscopic observations
of thirty objects in the field of view of PKS 1424+240 using the Gemini MOS.
After analysing the data for groups, we evaluated the probability of finding
groups of galaxies by chance around the position of PKS 1424+240, using a deep
catalogue of groups. We also used photometric data from the SDSS catalogue to
analyse the red sequence of the proposed blazar host group. We found a new

R_vir = 1.53 Mpc, and a velocity dispersion of sigma_v = 813 +- 187 km/s. The

that any homogeneous Laplacian soliton is equivalent to a semi-algebraic
soliton (i.e.\ a $G$-invariant $G_2$-structure on a homogeneous space $G/K$

solitons are geometrically characterized among Laplacian solitons as those with
a `diagonal' evolution. Unlike the Ricci flow case, where any homogeneous Ricci
soliton is isometric to an algebraic soliton, we have found, as an application
of the above characterization, an example of a left-invariant closed
semi-algebraic soliton on a nilpotent Lie group which is not equivalent to any
algebraic soliton. The (normalized) bracket flow evolution of such a soliton is
periodic. In the context of solvable Lie groups with a codimension-one abelian
normal subgroup, we obtain long time existence for any closed Laplacian flow

converges to zero. We also classify algebraic solitons in this class and
exhibit several explicit examples of closed expanding Laplacian solitons.

operators identifies with the naturally associated smooth convolution algebra
of the associated twisted gerbe. We develop the associated symbolic calculus,
symbol short exact sequences and existence of parametrices. In particular the
algebra of projective operators appears as a quantization of the twisted symbol
algebra. As the (untwisted) Lie groupoid case that it encompasses, the negative
order operators extend to the twisted $C^*$-algebra and the zero order
operators act as bounded multipliers on it. We obtain an analytic index
morphism in twisted K-theory associated in a classic way by the corresponding
pseudodifferential extension. We prove that this index morphism only depends on
the isomorphism class of the cocycle, {\it i.e.,} on the twisting as the

gravitational lensing. We probe the redshift and luminosity evolution of
intrinsic alignments in Horizon-AGN between z=0 and z=3 for galaxies with an
r-band absolute magnitude of <-20. Alignments transition from being radial at
low redshifts and high luminosities, dominated by the contribution of
ellipticals, to being tangential at high redshift and low luminosities, where
discs dominate the signal. This cannot be explained by the evolution of the
fraction of ellipticals and discs alone: intrinsic evolution in the amplitude
of alignments is necessary. The alignment amplitude of elliptical galaxies
alone is smaller in amplitude by a factor of ~2, but has similar luminosity and
redshift evolution as in current observations and in the nonlinear tidal
alignment model at projected separations of > 1 Mpc. Alignments of discs are
null in projection and consistent with current low redshift observations. The
combination of the two populations yields an overall amplitude a factor of ~4
lower than observed alignments of luminous red galaxies with a steeper
luminosity dependence. The restriction on accurate galaxy shapes implies that
the galaxy population in the simulation is complete only to an r-band absolute
magnitude of <-20. Higher resolution simulations will be necessary to avoid
extrapolation of the intrinsic alignment predictions to the range of
luminosities probed by future surveys.

diversification of commercial categories, studied through various measures of

the density of activities. Moreover, different couples of commercial categories
exhibit over the years a tendency to attract in space. Our results demonstrate
that the spatio-temporal distribution of commercial activities can provide
important insights on the urbanisation processes at work, revealing specific

events the velocity distribution of electrons reveal a dual structure with a
thermal (Maxwellian) core and a suprathermal (Kappa) halo. This paper presents
a detailed observational analysis of these two components, providing
estimations of their temperatures and temperature anisotropies and decoding any
potential interdependence that their properties may indicate. The data set used
in this study includes more than 120$\,$000 the events detected by three
missions in the ecliptic within an extended range of heliocentric distances
from 0.3 to over 4~AU. The anti-correlation found for the core and halo
temperatures is consistent with the radial evolution of the Kappa model,
clarifying an apparent contradiction in previous observational analysis and
providing valuable clues about the temperature of the Kappa-distributed
populations. However, these two components manifest a clear tendency to deviate
from isotropy in the same direction, that seems to confirm the existence of
mechanisms with similar effects on both components, e.g., the solar wind
expansion, or the particle heating by the fluctuations. On the other hand, the
existence of plasma states with anti-correlated anisotropies of the core and
halo populations suggests a dynamic interplay of these components, mediated,
most probably, by the anisotropy-driven instabilities.

operators generated by Dunkl generalization of the exponential function. We
obtain some approximation results using the Korovkin approximation theorem and
the weighted Korovkin-type theorem for these operators. We also study
convergence properties by using the modulus of continuity and the rate of
convergence of these operators for functions belonging to the Lipschitz class.
Furthermore, we obtain the rate of convergence in terms of the classical,
second order, and weighted modulus of continuity.
