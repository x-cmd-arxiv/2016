related to electrical transport properties in bulk ZnO, ZnMgO/ZnO, and
ZnMgO/ZnO/ZnMgO single and double heterostructures were analyzed quantitatively
and the most important scattering parameters for controlling electron
concentration and electron mobility were obtained. Treatment of intrinsic
mechanisms included polar-optical phonon scattering, piezoelectric scattering
and acoustic deformation potential scattering. For extrinsic mechanisms,
ionized impurity, dislocation scattering, and strain-induced fields were
included. For bulk ZnO, the reported experimental data were corrected for
removing the effects of a degenerate layer at the ZnO/sapphire interface via a
two layer Hall effect model. Also, donor density, acceptor density and donor
activation energy were determined via the charge balance equation. This sample
exhibited hopping conduction below 50K and dislocation scattering closely
controlled electron mobility closely. The obtained results indicated that the
enhancement of electron mobility in double sample, compared with the single
one, can be attributed to the reduction of dislocation density, two dimensional
impurity density in the potential well due to background impurities, and/or
interface charge and strain-induced fields, which can be related to better
electron confinement in the channel and enhancement in the sheet carrier
concentration of 2DEG in this sample.

The inclusion of finite bending energy in the simulation model reveals features
of actuation trajectory that may be absent when bending energy is neglected. We
examine geometries with a director pattern uniform through the film thickness
encoding multiple regions of positive Gaussian curvature. Simulations indicate
that heating such a system uniformly produces a disordered state with curved
regions emerging randomly in both directions due to the film's up-down
symmetry. By contrast, applying a thermal gradient by heating the material
first on one side breaks up-down symmetry and results in a deterministic
trajectory producing a more ordered final shape. We demonstrate that a folding
zone design containing cut-out areas accommodates transverse displacements
without warping or buckling; and demonstrate that bas-relief and more complex

t-structures). We prove that the kernel of $M_{k}^c$ vanishes and the
corresponding ""connectivity detection"" statement is also valid if and only if
$k$ is a non-orderable field; this is an easy consequence of the corresponding
results of T. Bachmann (who considered the case where the $2$-adic
cohomological dimension of $k$ is finite). We also sketch a deduction of these

that the kernel in question consists exactly of ""infinitely effective"" (in the
sense of Voevodsky's slice filtration) objects of $SH^c(k)$ (assuming that the
exponential characteristic of $k$ is inverted in the coefficient ring).
  These result allow (following another idea of Bachmann) to carry over his
results on the tensor invertibility of certain motives of affine quadrics to
the corresponding motivic spectra whenever $k$ is non-orderable. We also

known as subgraph counting, is fundamental to several domains such as genomics
and social network analysis. Many important special cases (e.g. triangle
counting) have received significant attention. Color coding is a very general
and powerful algorithmic technique for subgraph counting. Color coding has been
shown to be effective in several applications, but scalable implementations are
only known for the special case of {\em tree queries} (i.e. queries of
treewidth one).
  In this paper we present the first efficient distributed implementation for
color coding that goes beyond tree queries: our algorithm applies to any query
graph of treewidth $2$. Since tree queries can be solved in time linear in the
size of the data graph, our contribution is the first step into the realm of
colour coding for queries that require superlinear running time in the worst
case. This superlinear complexity leads to significant load balancing problems
on graphs with heavy tailed degree distributions. Our algorithm structures the
computation to work around high degree nodes in the data graph, and achieves
very good runtime and scalability on a diverse collection of data and query
graph pairs as a result. We also provide theoretical analysis of our
algorithmic techniques, showing asymptotic improvements in runtime on random
graphs with power law degree distributions, a popular model for real world
graphs.

There is a close connection between almost affine LRCs and matroid theory which
can be utilized to construct good LRCs and derive bounds on their performance.
  A generalized Singleton bound for linear LRCs with parameters
$(n,k,d,r,\delta)$ was given in [N. Prakash et al., ""Optimal Linear Codes with
a Local-Error-Correction Property"", IEEE Int. Symp. Inf. Theory]. In this
paper, a LRC achieving this bound is called perfect. Results on the existence

expands the class of parameters $(n,k,d,r,\delta)$ for which there exist

the output is the sum of the inputs. This provides a counterpoint to the
suggestion that dropout discourages co-adaptation of weights. We also show that
the dropout penalty can grow exponentially in the depth of the network while
the weight-decay penalty remains essentially linear, and that dropout is
insensitive to various re-scalings of the input features, outputs, and network
weights. This last insensitivity implies that there are no isolated local

dynamically evolve by a number of effects, including the Yarkovsky drift,
chaotic diffusion, and gravitational encounters with massive asteroids, such
that it is difficult to infer the ejection velocities eons after each family's
formation. Here we analyze the inclination distribution of asteroid families,
because proper inclination can remain constant over long time intervals, and
could help us to understand the distribution of the component of the ejection
velocity that is perpendicular to the orbital plane ($v_{W}$). From modeling
the initial breakup, we find that the distribution of $v_{W}$ of the fragments,
which manage to escape the parent body's gravity, should be more peaked than a
Gaussian distribution (i.e., be leptokurtic) even if the initial distribution
was Gaussian. We surveyed known asteroid families for signs of a peaked
distribution of $v_{W}$ using a statistical measure of the distribution
peakedness or flatness known as kurtosis. We identified eight families whose
$v_{W}$ distribution is significantly leptokurtic. These cases (e.g. the
Koronis family) are located in dynamically quiet regions of the main belt,
where, presumably, the initial distribution of $v_{W}$ was not modified by
subsequent orbital evolution. We suggest that, in these cases, the inclination
distribution can be used to obtain interesting information about the original
ejection velocity field.

applications: tracking the influential nodes in dynamic networks. Specifically,
we model a dynamic network as a stream of edge weight updates. This general
model embraces many practical scenarios as special cases, such as edge and node
insertions, deletions as well as evolving weighted graphs. Under the popularly
adopted linear threshold model and independent cascade model, we consider two
essential versions of the problem: finding the nodes whose influences passing a
user specified threshold and finding the top-$k$ most influential nodes. Our
key idea is to use the polling-based methods and maintain a sample of random RR
sets so that we can approximate the influence of nodes with provable quality
guarantees. We develop an efficient algorithm that incrementally updates the
sample random RR sets against network changes. We also design methods to
determine the proper sample sizes for the two versions of the problem so that

parent body. The fragments with ejection speeds higher than the escape velocity
from the parent body can escape its gravitational pull. The cloud of escaping
debris can be identified by the proximity of orbits in proper element, or
frequency, domains. Obtaining estimates of the original ejection speed can
provide valuable constraints on the physical processes occurring during
collision, and used to calibrate impact simulations. Unfortunately, proper
elements of asteroids families are modified by gravitational and
non-gravitational effects, such as resonant dynamics, encounters with massive
bodies, and the Yarkovsky effect, such that information on the original
ejection speeds is often lost, especially for older, more evolved families.
  It has been recently suggested that the distribution in proper inclination of
the Koronis family may have not been significantly perturbed by local dynamics,
and that information on the component of the ejection velocity that is
perpendicular to the orbital plane ($v_W$), may still be available, at least in
part. In this work we estimate the magnitude of the original ejection velocity
speeds of Koronis members using the observed distribution in proper
eccentricity and inclination, and accounting for the spread caused by dynamical
effects. Our results show that i) the spread in the original ejection speeds
is, to within a 15% error, inversely proportional to the fragment size, and ii)
the minimum ejection velocity is of the order of 50 m/s, with larger values
possible depending on the orbital configuration at the break-up.

interest in the past decade. Such codes trade the bandwidth needed to repair a
failed node with the overall amount of data stored in the network. Minimum
storage regenerating (MSR) codes are an important class of optimal regenerating
codes that minimize (first) the amount of data stored per node and (then) the
repair bandwidth. Specifically, an $[n,k,d]$-$(\alpha)$ MSR code $\mathbb{C}$
over $\mathbb{F}_q$ is defined as follows. Using such a code $\mathbb{C}$, a
file $\cal{F}$ consisting of $\alpha k$ symbols over $\mathbb{F}_q$ can be
distributed among $n$ nodes, each storing $\alpha$ symbols, in such a way that:
The file $\cal{F}$ can be recovered by downloading the content of any $k$ of
the $n$ nodes; and the content of any failed node can be reconstructed by
accessing any $d$ of the remaining $n-1$ nodes and downloading $\alpha/(d-k+1)$
symbols from each of these nodes. Unfortunately, explicit constructions of
$[n,k,d]$ MSR codes are known only for certain special cases: either low rate,
namely $k/n<0.5$, or high repair connectivity, namely $d = n-1$. Although
setting $d = n-1$ minimizes the repair bandwidth, it may be impractical to
connect to all the remaining nodes in order to repair a single failed node. Our
main result in this paper is an explicit construction of systematic-repair
$[n,k,d]$ MSR codes for all possible values of parameters $n,k,d$. In
particular, we construct systematic-repair MSR codes of high rate $k/n>0.5$ and
low repair connectivity $k< d<n-1$. Such codes were not previously known to
exist. In order to construct these codes, we solve simultaneously several
repair scenarios, each of which is expressible as an interference alignment
problem. Extension of our results beyond systematic repair remains an open
problem.

depend crucially on the assumed priors, even if the dark energy was described
by a dynamical scalar field with a constant equation of state parameter $w$
linearly coupled to the electromagnetic sector through a dimensionless coupling
$\zeta$. We find that, although local atomic clock tests, as well as other

cannot be used to set or to improve upper limits on $|\zeta|$ or $|w+1|$

our property by starting from the well-established notion of fully abstract

standard full abstraction unsuitable for compartmentalization. The connection

ideal videogrammetry system should be easy to use, low cost, with minimal
equipment, and fast realization. The CvMob is a free tool for dynamic
evaluation of human movements that express measurements in figures, tables, and
graphics. This paper aims to determine if CvMob is a reliable tool for the
evaluation of two dimensional human gait. This is a validity and reliability
study. The sample was composed of 56 healthy individuals who walked on a
9-meterlong walkway and were simultaneously filmed by CvMob and Vicon system
cameras. Linear trajectories and angular measurements were compared to validate
the CvMob system, and inter and intrarater findings of the same measurements
were used to determine reliability. A strong correlation (rs mean = 0.988) of
the linear trajectories between systems and inter and intrarater analysis were
found. According to the Bland-Altman method, the angles that had good agreement
between systems were maximum flexion and extension (stance and swing) of the
knee and dorsiflexion range of motion and stride length. The CvMob is a
reliable tool for analysis of linear motion and lengths in two-dimensional
evaluations of human gait. The angular measurements demonstrate high agreement
for the knee joint; however, the hip and ankle measurements were limited by
differences between systems.

analogously to the usual merit factor for autocorrelation, and if we define
demerit factor as the reciprocal of merit factor, then randomly selected binary
sequence pairs are known to have an average crosscorrelation demerit factor of
$1$. Our constructions provide sequence pairs with crosscorrelation demerit
factor significantly less than $1$, and at the same time, the autocorrelation
demerit factors of the individual sequences can also be made significantly less
than $1$ (which also indicates better than average performance). The sequence
pairs studied here provide combinations of autocorrelation and crosscorrelation
performance that are not achievable using sequences formed from single

Legendre sequences. In this study, exact asymptotic formulae are proved for the
autocorrelation and crosscorrelation merit factors of sequence pairs formed

shows that the asymptotic behavior is closely approximated by sequences of

continuous-time trading strategies which, in contrast to the classical setting
of continuous-time finance, does not rely on stochastic integrals or other
probabilistic notions. Using the recently developed 'non-anticipative
functional calculus', we first develop a pathwise definition of the gain
process for a large class of continuous-time trading strategies which include
the important class of delta-hedging strategies, as well as a pathwise
definition of the self-financing condition. Using these concepts, we propose a
framework for analyzing the performance and robustness of delta-hedging
strategies for path-dependent derivatives across a given set of scenarios. Our
setting allows for general path-dependent payoffs and does not require any
probabilistic assumption on the dynamics of the underlying asset, thereby
extending previous results on robustness of hedging strategies in the setting
of diffusion models. We obtain a pathwise formula for the hedging error for a
general path-dependent derivative and provide sufficient conditions ensuring
the robustness of the delta hedge. We show in particular that robust hedges may
be obtained in a large class of continuous exponential martingale models under
a vertical convexity condition on the payoff functional. Under the same
conditions, we show that discontinuities in the underlying asset always
deteriorate the hedging performance. These results are applied to the case of
Asian options and barrier options. The last chapter, independent of the rest of
the thesis, proposes a novel method, jointly developed with Andrea Pascucci and
Stefano Pagliarani, for analytical approximations in local volatility models
with L\'evy jumps. Numerical tests confirm the effectiveness of the method.

that these events form in an environment where the metallicity is less than 10

dynamical formation channels involving globular clusters (11) and is comparable

  Distributed hash table (DHT) abstraction, heterogeneous nodes, and non
uniform distribution of objects are the reasons to cause load imbalance in
structured P2P overlay networks.
  Previous works solved the load balancing problem by assuming the homogeneous
capabilities of nodes, unawareness of the link latency during transferring
load, and imposing logical structures to collect and reassign load.
  We propose a distributed load balancing algorithm with the topology awareness
feature by using the concept of virtual servers.
  In our approach, each node collects neighborhood load information from
physically close nodes and reassigns virtual servers to overlay nodes based
upon the topology of underlying network.
  Consequently, our approach converges data load balancing quickly and it also
reduces the load transfer cost between nodes.
  Moreover, our approach increases the quality of load balancing among close
nodes of overlay and it also introduces a new tradeoff between the quality of
load balancing and load transfer cost among all overlay nodes.
  Our simulations show that our approach reduces the load transfer cost and it
saves network bandwidth respectively.
  Finally, we show that the in-degree imbalance of nodes, as a consequence of
topology awareness, cannot lead to a remarkable problem in topology aware
overlays.

circumstellar disks. The magnetic field connects the rapidly rotating central
region with the outer envelope and extracts angular momentum from the central
region during gravitational collapse of the cloud core. This process is known
as magnetic braking. Both analytical and multidimensional simulations have
shown that disk formation is strongly suppressed by magnetic braking in
moderately magnetized cloud cores in the ideal magnetohydrodynamic limit. On
the other hand, recent observations have provided growing evidence of a
relatively large disk several tens of astronomical units in size existing in
some Class 0 young stellar objects. This introduces a serious discrepancy
between the theoretical study and observations. Various physical mechanisms
have been proposed to solve the problem of catastrophic magnetic braking, such
as misalignment between the magnetic field and the rotation axis, turbulence,
and non-ideal effect. In this paper, we review the mechanism of magnetic
braking, its effect on disk formation and early evolution, and the mechanisms
that resolve the magnetic braking problem. In particular, we emphasize the
importance of non-ideal effects. The combination of magnetic diffusion and
thermal evolution during gravitational collapse provides a robust formation
process for the circumstellar disk at the very early phase of protostar
formation. The rotation induced by the Hall effect can supply a sufficient
amount of angular momentum for typical circumstellar disks around T Tauri
stars. By examining the combination of the suggested mechanisms, we conclude
that the circumstellar disks commonly form in the very early phase of protostar
formation.

should be useful in improving calculations of nuclear structure and important
astrophysical reactions involving alpha capture on nuclei. Our findings also
provide a tool to probe the structure of alpha cluster states such as the Hoyle

These bounds that are much more computable than similar bounds in the

SPP method allows us to efficiently find a superset of all the predictive

advantage of the SPP method over existing boosting-type method is that the
former can find the superset by a single search over the database, while the
latter requires multiple searches. The SPP method is inspired by recent
development of safe feature screening. In order to extend the idea of safe
feature screening into predictive pattern mining, we derive a novel pruning
rule called safe pattern pruning (SPP) rule that can be used for searching over
the tree defined among patterns in the database. The SPP rule has a property
that, if a node corresponding to a pattern in the database is pruned out by the
SPP rule, then it is guaranteed that all the patterns corresponding to its
descendant nodes are never needed for the optimal predictive model. We apply
the SPP method to graph mining and item-set mining problems, and demonstrate

(AS), a linear manifold of the stochastic space characterized by maximal
response variation. The idea is that one should first identify this low
dimensional manifold, project the high-dimensional input onto it, and then link
the projection to the output. In this work, we develop a probabilistic version
of AS which is gradient-free and robust to observational noise. Our approach
relies on a novel Gaussian process regression with built-in dimensionality
reduction with the AS represented as an orthogonal projection matrix that
serves as yet another covariance function hyper-parameter to be estimated from
the data. To train the model, we design a two-step maximum likelihood
optimization procedure that ensures the orthogonality of the projection matrix
by exploiting recent results on the Stiefel manifold. The additional benefit of
our probabilistic formulation is that it allows us to select the dimensionality
of the AS via the Bayesian information criterion. We validate our approach by
showing that it can discover the right AS in synthetic examples without
gradient information using both noiseless and noisy observations. We
demonstrate that our method is able to discover the same AS as the classical
approach in a challenging one-hundred-dimensional problem involving an elliptic
stochastic partial differential equation with random conductivity. Finally, we
use our approach to study the effect of geometric and material uncertainties in

  Provably Efficient Schedulers",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The nested parallel (a.k.a. fork-join) model is widely used for writing
parallel programs. However, the two composition constructs, i.e. ""$\parallel$""
(parallel) and ""$;$"" (serial), are insufficient in expressing ""partial
dependencies"" or ""partial parallelism"" in a program. We propose a new dataflow
composition construct ""$\leadsto$"" to express partial dependencies in
algorithms in a processor- and cache-oblivious way, thus extending the Nested
Parallel (NP) model to the \emph{Nested Dataflow} (ND) model. We redesign
several divide-and-conquer algorithms ranging from dense linear algebra to
dynamic-programming in the ND model and prove that they all have optimal span
while retaining optimal cache complexity. We propose the design of runtime
schedulers that map ND programs to multicore processors with multiple levels of
possibly shared caches (i.e, Parallel Memory Hierarchies) and provide
theoretical guarantees on their ability to preserve locality and load balance.
For this, we adapt space-bounded (SB) schedulers for the ND model. We show that
our algorithms have increased ""parallelizability"" in the ND model, and that SB
schedulers can use the extra parallelizability to achieve asymptotically
optimal bounds on cache misses and running time on a greater number of
processors than in the NP model. The running time for the algorithms in this
paper is $O\left(\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{h-1} Q^{*}({\mathsf t};\sigma\cdot M_i)\cdot
C_i}{p}\right)$, where $Q^{*}$ is the cache complexity of task ${\mathsf t}$,
$C_i$ is the cost of cache miss at level-$i$ cache which is of size $M_i$,
$\sigma\in(0,1)$ is a constant, and $p$ is the number of processors in an
$h$-level cache hierarchy.

industries for minimizing mass, especially the design of aerospace vehicles.
Optimizing a single primary load member independently of all other primary
structures is an incomplete process, due to the redistribution of internal
loads, as the stiffness distribution changes. That is, optimizing a component
changes joint loads, which then calls for a new optimization - changing
internal loads changes the optimum. This is particularly evident under buckling
(stability) constraints. The goal is to develop a finite element-based
optimization approach which can be used to optimize each component of a large,
primary structure assembly. The optimization objective function will be to
minimize mass for the system, and the constraints will be both stress
constraints as well as buckling constraints. The research aims to improve both
the solution and practical usability of these models. The system of interest is
a spacecraft fuselage, of which the member components are panels throughout the
structure. We present analyses of several main optimization methods, and define

nearly perfect conversion efficiency. In view of the eliminated vertical

pattern at the near-field region, which cannot be achieved by convectional
metasurfaces composed of discrete scatterers. On the other hand, the

correlated with patient status. Similarly, when presenting word stimuli,
variables such as word frequency are often correlated with primary variables of

two stimulus sets, they are considered as matched for word length. Such a test
has high error rates and is conceptually misguided. It reflects a common
misunderstanding of statistical tests: interpreting significance not to refer
to inference about a particular population parameter, but about 1. the sample

the rods on a membrane tube assemble along the azimuthal direction first and
subsequently along the longitudinal direction. Here, we show that both

curvature-inducing isotropic inclusions are also simulated. When the isotropic
inclusions have the same bending rigidity as the other membrane regions, the
inclusions are uniformly distributed on the membrane tubes and vesicles even

concentrated on the region of a preferred curvature. For high rod density, high
rod stiffness, and/or low line tension of the membrane edge, the rod assembly
induces vesicle rupture, resulting in the formation of a high-genus vesicle. A
gradual change in the curvature suppresses this rupture. Hence, large stress,
compared to the edge tension, induced by the rod assembly is the key factor
determining rupture. For rod curvature with the opposite sign to the vesicle
curvature, membrane rupture induces inversion of the membrane, leading to
division into multiple vesicles as well as formation of a high-genus vesicle.

also present a protocol to implement a single-qubit unitary with parameters
determined by a remote party with the help of up to three repeater nodes. It is
assumed that the neighboring nodes are connected by noisy photonic channels,
and the local gates can be performed quite accurately, while the decoherence of
memories is significant. A unitary is often a part of a larger computation or
communication task in a quantum network, and to reduce the amount of
decoherence in other systems of the network, we focus on the goal of saving the
total time for implementing a unitary including the time for entanglement
preparation. We review some previously studied protocols that implement
bipartite unitaries using local operations and classical communication and
prior shared entanglement, and apply them to the situation with repeater nodes
without prior entanglement. We find that the protocols using piecewise
entanglement between neighboring nodes often require less total time compared
to preparing entanglement between the two end nodes first and then performing
the previously known protocols. For a generic bipartite unitary, as the number
of repeater nodes increases, the total time could approach the time cost for
direct signal transfer from one end node to the other. We also prove some lower
bounds of the total time when there are a small number of repeater nodes. The
application to position-based cryptography is discussed.

The observations were made with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) on 21
February 2014 in the range 40-48 GHz. The full polarization mode and A
configuration of the array were used. The average total and linearly polarized
flux density of the pulsar amounts to 2.3$\pm$0.31 mJy/beam and 1.5$\pm$0.2
mJy/beam, respectively. Analysis shows a rotation measure (RM) of
(-67$\pm$3)x10$^3$ rad/m$^2$, which is in a good agreement with previous
measurements at longer wavelengths. These high frequency observations are
sensitive to RM values of up to ~2x10$^7$ rad/m$^2$. However, application of
the Faraday RM synthesis technique did not reveal other significant RM
components in the pulsar emission. This supports an external nature of a single
thin Faraday-rotating screen which should be located close to the Galactic
center. The Faraday corrected intrinsic electric vector position angle is
16$\pm$9 deg East of North, and coincides with the position angle of the
pulsar's transverse velocity. All measurements of the pulsar's RM value to
date, including the one presented here, well agree within errors, which points
towards a steady nature of the Faraday-rotating medium.

radiation are required by gamma-ray burst (GRB) observations, yet they are
difficult to simultaneously achieve. Three leading mechanisms have been
proposed to explain the observed emission emanating from GRB outflows:
radiation from either relativistic internal or external shocks, or thermal
emission from a photosphere. Previous works were dedicated to independently
treating these three mechanisms and arguing for a sole, unique origin of the
prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts. In contrast, herein, we first explain why
all three models are valid mechanisms and that a contribution from each of them
is expected in the prompt phase. Additionally, we show that a single parameter,
the dimensionless entropy of the GRB outflow, determines which mechanism
contributes the most to the emission. More specifically, internal shocks
dominate for low values of the dimensionless entropy, external shocks for
intermediate values and finally, photospheric emission for large values. We
present a unified framework for the emission mechanisms of GRBs with easily
testable predictions for each process.

challenging problem. The main obstacle of this problem is in the difficulty of
taking into account the selection bias, i.e., the bias arising from the fact
that patterns are selected from extremely large number of candidates in

mining problems that can address the selection bias issue. Our approach is
built on a recently popularized statistical inference framework called
selective inference. In selective inference, statistical inferences (such as
statistical hypothesis testing) are conducted based on sampling distributions
conditional on a selection event. If the selection event is characterized in a
tractable way, statistical inferences can be made without minding selection
bias issue. However, in pattern mining problems, it is difficult to
characterize the entire selection process of mining algorithms. Our main
contribution in this paper is to solve this challenging problem for a class of
predictive pattern mining problems by introducing a novel algorithmic
framework. We demonstrate that our approach is useful for finding statistically
significant patterns from databases.

increases the interaction strength between atoms and ions by many orders of

entanglement between an atom and the motion or internal state of an ion.
Furthermore, the ion could be used as a bus for mediating spin-spin
interactions between atomic spins in analogy to much employed techniques in ion
trap quantum simulation. The proposed scheme comes with attractive features as
it maps the benefits of the trapped ion quantum system onto the atomic one
without obviously impeding its intrinsic scalability. No ground state cooling
of the ion or atom is required and the setup allows for full dynamical control.
Moreover, the scheme is to a large extent immune to the micromotion of the ion.

for simulating a canonical ensemble. An estimate of a mechanical property, like
energy, of an equilibrium system, can be made by averaging over a large number
microstates generated by Boltzmann Monte Carlo methods. However, a thermal
property like entropy is not easily accessible to these methods. The reason is
simple. We can assign a numerical value for energy to each microstate. But we
can not assign a numerical value for entropy, to a microstate. Entropy is not a
property associated with any single microstate.It is a collective property of
allthe microstates. Toward calculating entropy and other thermal properties, a
non-Boltzmann Monte Carlo technique called Umbrella sampling was proposed in
the mid-seventies (of the last century). Umbrella sampling has since undergone
several metamorphoses and we have now, multi-canonical Monte Carlo, entropic
sampling, flat histogram methods, Wang-Landau algorithm {\it etc.} This class
of methods generates non-Boltzmann ensembles which are un-physical. However,
physical quantities can be calculated by un-weighting of the microstates of the

centrosymmetric. Samples of cubic BaTiO3 are known to exhibit breaking of the
centric symmetry locally and globally. It has been proposed that the local
symmetry breaking originates in polar regions, the precursors of the
ferroelectric phase. Origins of the macroscopic symmetry breaking, which are
not well understood, have been previously tentatively correlated with
inhomogeneities in the samples, such as strain gradients that may align or
redistribute objects such as charged point defects or polar regions making
material macroscopically polar. No such data are available for BaTiO3 with
hexagonal symmetry. We compare dielectric, elastic, and pyroelectric properties
of the two materials in polycrystalline form. In contrast to cubic BaTiO3,
hexagonal BaTiO3 does not exhibit macroscopic pyroelectric response at room
temperature. This is consistent with apparent absence of polar regions in the
hexagonal material and the fact that in hexagonal BaTiO3 strain rather then
polarization is the order parameter for the phase transition into
ferroelectric-ferroelastic phase. The thermally stimulated currents measured in
hexagonal and cubic BaTiO3, however, show that both materials exhibit
noncentric macroscopic symmetry. This result supports the idea that extrinsic
factors such as strain gradients, which are apparently common for both
materials, may break the macroscopic symmetry, which may then lead to alignment
and redistribution of polar regions or charged defects.

symbiotic binaries is not well understood. For example, the efficiency of wind
mass transfer of the canonical Bondi-Hoyle accretion mechanism is too low to
power the typical luminosities of the accretors. However, recent observations
and modelling indicate a considerably more efficient mass transfer in symbiotic
binaries.
  Aims. We determine the velocity profile of the wind from the giant at the
near-orbital-plane region of eclipsing S-type symbiotic binaries EG And and SY
Mus, and derive the corresponding spherical equivalent of the mass-loss rate.
With this approach, we indicate the high mass transfer ratio.
  Methods. We achieved this aim by modelling the observed column densities
taking into account ionization of the wind of the giant, whose velocity profile
is derived using the inversion of Abel's integral operator for the hydrogen
column density function.
  Results. Our analysis revealed the spherical equivalent of the mass-loss rate
from the giant to be a few times 10^{-6}M_{Sun}/yr, which is a factor of >=10
higher than rates determined by methods that do not depend on the line of
sight. This discrepancy rules out the usual assumption that the wind is
spherically symmetric. As our values were derived from near-orbital-plane
column densities, these values can be a result of focusing the wind from the
giant towards the orbital plane.
  Conclusions. Our findings suggests that the wind from giants in S-type
symbiotic stars is not spherically symmetric, since it is enhanced at the
orbital plane and, thus, is accreted more effectively onto the hot component.

with constant and observable volatility and constant but unknown drift
parameter. For transforming the problem to a problem with complete information,
we derive a suitable filter. The optimal value function is characterized as the
unique viscosity solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.
We state a numerical procedure for approximating both the optimal dividend
strategy and the corresponding value function. Furthermore, threshold
strategies are discussed in some detail. Finally, we calculate the probability
of ruin in the uncontrolled and controlled situation.

with $k$ initial opinions. We design an efficient and simple protocol in the
asynchronous communication model that ensures that all nodes eventually agree
on the initially most frequent opinion. In this model, each node is equipped
with a random Poisson clock with parameter $\lambda=1$. Whenever a node's clock
ticks, it samples some neighbors, uniformly at random and with replacement, and
adjusts its opinion according to the sample.
  A prominent example is the so-called two-choices algorithm in the synchronous
model, where in each round, every node chooses two neighbors uniformly at
random, and if the two sampled opinions coincide, then that opinion is adopted.
This protocol is very efficient and well-studied when $k=2$. If
$k=O(n^\varepsilon)$ for some small $\varepsilon$, we show that it converges to
the initial plurality opinion within $O(k \cdot \log{n})$ rounds, w.h.p., as
long as the initial difference between the largest and second largest opinion
is $\Omega(\sqrt{n \log n})$. On the other side, we show that there are cases
in which $\Omega(k)$ rounds are needed, w.h.p.
  One can beat this lower bound in the synchronous model by combining the
two-choices protocol with randomized broadcasting. Our main contribution is a
non-trivial adaptation of this approach to the asynchronous model. If the
support of the most frequent opinion is at least $(1+\varepsilon)$ times that
of the second-most frequent one and $k=O(\exp(\log{n}/\log \log{n}))$, then our
protocol achieves the best possible run time of $O(\log n)$, w.h.p. We relax
full synchronicity by allowing $o(n)$ nodes to be poorly synchronized, and the
well synchronized nodes are only required to be within a certain time
difference from one another. We enforce this synchronicity by introducing a
novel gadget into the protocol.

phylogenetic invariants, then provided these are sufficiently informative, the
identifiability of the tree topology can be restored. In this paper, we
investigate a class of processes that support linear invariants once the
stationary distribution is fixed, the `equal input model'. This model
generalizes the `Felsenstein 1981' model (and thereby the Jukes--Cantor model)
from four states to an arbitrary number of states (finite or infinite), and it
can also be described by a `random cluster' process. We describe the structure
and dimension of the vector spaces of phylogenetic mixtures and of linear
invariants for any fixed phylogenetic tree (and for all trees -- the so called
`model invariants'), on any number $n$ of leaves. We also provide a precise
description of the space of mixtures and linear invariants for the special case

impact on the black hole mass calculation due to different BLR geometries and
the inclination of the AGN. Monte Carlo simulations of two disk wind models are
constructed to recover the virial scale factor, $f$, at various inclination

into virial black hole mass estimates for a large sample of AGN. However, the
extent of the bias depends on the line width characterisation (e.g. full width
at half maximum (FWHM) or line dispersion). Masses estimated using
$f_{\text{FWHM}}$ tend to biased towards larger masses, but this can be
corrected by calibrating for the width or shape of the emission line.

efficiency on a simple, highly symmetric graph represented by a ring. The

For a two-state quantum walk, where the excitation (walker) has to leave its
actual position to the neighboring sites, the survival probability decays
exponentially and the transport efficiency is unity. The decay rate of the
survival probability can be estimated using the leading eigenvalue of the
evolution operator. However, if the excitation is allowed to stay at its

part of the wave-packet can be trapped in the vicinity of the origin and never
reaches the sink. In such a case, the survival probability does not vanish and
the excitation transport is not efficient. The dependency of the transport
efficiency on the initial state is determined. Nevertheless, we show that for

allocating recovery resources among the population, at the lowest cost possible
to prevent the epidemic from persisting indefinitely in the network.
Specifically, we analyze a susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic process
spreading over a weighted graph, by means of a first-order mean-field
approximation. First, we describe the influence of the contact network on the
dynamics of the epidemics among a heterogeneous population, that is possibly
divided into communities. For the case of a community network, our
investigation relies on the graph-theoretical notion of equitable partition; we
show that the epidemic threshold, a key measure of the network robustness
against epidemic spreading, can be determined using a lower-dimensional
dynamical system. Exploiting the computation of the epidemic threshold, we
determine a cost-optimal curing policy by solving a convex minimization
problem, which possesses a reduced dimension in the case of a community

FAMIAS was used to analyze the line profile variations. The method of spectrum
synthesis was used for spectroscopically determining the fundamental
atmospheric parameters and individual chemical abundances. A total of 90
different frequencies was identified and analyzed. An unambiguous
identification of the azimuthal order of the surface geometry could only be
provided for the dominant p-mode, which was found to be a nonradial prograde
mode with m = +1. Using $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and $\log g$, we estimated the mass,

possibly due to a transiting giant planet. Later, a planetary mass companion to
the star, Beta Pic b, was identified using imagery. Observations at different
epochs (2003 and 2009-2015) detected the planet at a projected distance of 6 to
9 AU from the star and showed that the planet is on an edge-on orbit. The
observed motion is consistent with an inferior conjunction in 1981, and Beta
Pic b can be the transiting planet proposed to explain the photometric event
observed at that time. Assuming that the 1981 event is related to the transit
or the inferior conjunction of Beta Pic b on an edge-on orbit, we search for
the planetary orbit in agreement with all the measurements of the planet
position published so far. We find two different orbits that are compatible
with all these constraints: (i) an orbit with a period of 17.97$\pm$0.08 years
along with an eccentricity of around 0.12 and (ii) an orbit with a period of
36.38$\pm$0.13 years and a larger eccentricity of about 0.32. In the near

conditions in addition to the Maxwell constraints. These extra conditions,
however, require knowledge of the history of the solution and, as we discuss,
effectively turn the Maxwell-Lorentz system into a system of delay equations

singular light fronts persist in a smoothened form and, as we argue, yield

distinguish scenarios with isolated photons from models leading to ""photon

by a process of the form $p p \to S \to a a \to 4\gamma$, where $S$ is a new

exploiting the fact that a large fraction of photons convert to an $e^+e^-$

power, and we study how the sensitivity of future searches differs for photon
jets compared to isolated photons. We also investigate how our results depend
on the lifetime of the particle(s) decaying to the photon jet. Finally, we
discuss the extension to $S\to A^\prime A^\prime\to e^+e^-e^+e^-$, where there
are no photons at all but the dark photon $A^\prime$ decays to $e^+e^-$ pairs.

wormhole solutions are obtained, including the constant redshift function,
traceless stress energy tensor, a special choice for the shape function as well

necessary to theoretically construct the traversable wormholes by matching the

Phys. Rev. B 63, 212404 (2001)] that the latter can be considered to be a
result of local measurements destroying the entanglement of the quantum ground
state, we have performed systematic simulations of the effects of von
Neumannmeasurements for the case of a one-dimensional antiferromagnetic
spin-1/2 system for various types and degrees of magnetic anisotropies. It is
found that in the ground state, a magnetization measurement can create
decoherence waves [M. I. Katsnelson et al. Phys. Rev. A 62, 022118 (2000)] in
the magnetic sublattices, and that a symmetry breaking anisotropy does not lead
to alignment of the spins in a particular direction. However, for an easy-axis
anisotropy of the same order magnitude as the exchange constant, a measurement
on the singlet ground state can create N\'eel-ordering in finite systems of
experimentally accessible size.

Pixton",,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Curves of genus g which admit a map to CP1 with specified ramification
profile mu over 0 and nu over infinity define a double ramification cycle
DR_g(mu,nu) on the moduli space of curves. The study of the restrictions of
these cycles to the moduli of nonsingular curves is a classical topic. In 2003,
Hain calculated the cycles for curves of compact type. We study here double
ramification cycles on the moduli space of Deligne-Mumford stable curves.
  The cycle DR_g(mu,nu) for stable curves is defined via the virtual
fundamental class of the moduli of stable maps to rubber. Our main result is
the proof of an explicit formula for DR_g(mu,nu) in the tautological ring
conjectured by Pixton in 2014. The formula expresses the double ramification
cycle as a sum over stable graphs (corresponding to strata classes) with
summand equal to a product over markings and edges. The result answers a
question of Eliashberg from 2001 and specializes to Hain's formula in the
compact type case.
  When mu and nu are both empty, the formula for double ramification cycles
expresses the top Chern class lambda_g of the Hodge bundle of the moduli space
of stable genus g curves as a push-forward of tautological classes supported on
the divisor of nonseparating nodes. Applications to Hodge integral calculations
are given.

efficient preparation of such W-like states is of great importance in quantum
communications, which has not been studied as much as the preparation of W
states. In this letter, we propose a simple optical scheme for efficient
preparation of large-scale polarization based entangled W-like states by fusing
two W-like states or expanding a W-like state with an ancilla photon. Our
scheme can also generate large-scale W states by fusing or expanding W or even
W-like states. The cost analysis show that in generating large scale W states,
the fusion mechanism achieves a higher efficiency with non-maximally entangled
W-like states than maximally entangled W states. Our scheme can also start
fusion or expansion with Bell states, and it is composed of a polarization
dependent beam splitter, two polarizing beam splitters and photon detectors.
Requiring no ancilla photons or controlled gates to operate, our scheme can be
realized with the current photonics technology and we believe it enables
advances in quantum teleportation and superdense coding in multipartite
settings.

stays, improving patient outcomes, allocating critical care resources, and
reducing preventable re-admissions. In this paper, we focus on an important
problem of predicting the so-called ""patient flow"" from longitudinal electronic
health records (EHRs), which has not been explored via existing machine
learning techniques. By treating a sequence of transition events as a point
process, we develop a novel framework for modeling patient flow through various
CUs and jointly predicting patients' destination CUs and duration days. Instead
of learning a generative point process model via maximum likelihood estimation,
we propose a novel discriminative learning algorithm aiming at improving the
prediction of transition events in the case of sparse data. By parameterizing
the proposed model as a mutually-correcting process, we formulate the
estimation problem via generalized linear models, which lends itself to
efficient learning based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).
Furthermore, we achieve simultaneous feature selection and learning by adding a
group-lasso regularizer to the ADMM algorithm. Additionally, for suppressing
the negative influence of data imbalance on the learning of model, we
synthesize auxiliary training data for the classes with extremely few samples,
and improve the robustness of our learning method accordingly. Testing on
