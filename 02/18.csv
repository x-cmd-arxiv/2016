  graphs",,,,,"cs.RO cs.CG math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Roadmaps constructed by many sampling-based motion planners coincide, in the
absence of obstacles, with standard models of random geometric graphs (RGGs).
Those models have been studied for several decades and by now a rich body of
literature exists analyzing various properties and types of RGGs. In their
seminal work on optimal motion planning Karaman and Frazzoli (2011) conjectured
that a sampling-based planner has a certain property if the underlying RGG has
this property as well. In this paper we settle this conjecture and leverage it
for the development of a general framework for the analysis of sampling-based
planners. Our framework, which we call localization-tessellation, allows for
easy transfer of arguments on RGGs from the free unit-hypercube to spaces
punctured by obstacles, which are geometrically and topologically much more
complex. We demonstrate its power by providing alternative and (arguably)
simple proofs for probabilistic completeness and asymptotic (near-)optimality
of probabilistic roadmaps (PRMs). Furthermore, we introduce several variants of
PRMs, analyze them using our framework, and discuss the implications of the
analysis.

  the Exponential Replacement","20th International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas (WSA), March 2016,
  Munich, Germany",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While 1-bit analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) allows to significantly reduce
the analog complexity of wireless receive systems, using the exact likelihood
function of the hard-limiting system model in order to obtain efficient
algorithms in the digital domain can make 1-bit signal processing challenging.
If the signal model before the quantizer consists of correlated Gaussian random
variables, the tail probability for a multivariate Gaussian distribution with N
dimensions (general orthant probability) is required in order to formulate the
likelihood function of the quantizer output. As a closed-form expression for
the general orthant probability is an open mathematical problem, formulation of
efficient processing methods for correlated and quantized data and an
analytical performance assessment have, despite their high practical relevance,
only found limited attention in the literature on quantized estimation theory.
Here we review the approach of replacing the original system model by an
equivalent distribution within the exponential family. For 1-bit signal
processing, this allows to circumvent calculation of the general orthant
probability and gives access to a conservative approximation of the receive
likelihood. For the application of blind direction-of-arrival (DOA) parameter
estimation with an array of K sensors, each performing 1-bit quantization, we
demonstrate how the exponential replacement enables to formulate a pessimistic
version of the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and to derive an asymptotically
achieving conservative maximum-likelihood estimator (CMLE). The 1-bit DOA
performance analysis based on the pessimistic CRLB points out that a
low-complexity radio front-end design with 1-bit ADC is in particular suitable
for blind wireless DOA estimation with a large number of array elements
operating in the medium SNR regime.

Branch (EHB) stars in omega Cen. The observations performed consist of nearly

obtained photometry for some 300 EHB stars. Based on the spectroscopy, we
derive reliable values of log g, Teff and log(N(He)/N(H)) for 38 targets, as
well as estimates of the effective temperature for another nine targets. The
survey uncovered a total of five rapid variables with multi-periodic
oscillations between 85 and 125 s. Spectroscopically, they form a homogeneous
group of hydrogen-rich subdwarf O stars clustered between 48,000 and 54,000 K.
For each of the variables we are able to measure between two and three
significant pulsations believed to constitute independent harmonic
oscillations. In addition to the rapid variables, we found an EHB star with an
apparently periodic luminosity variation of ~2700 s, which we tentatively
suggest may be caused by ellipsoidal variations in a close binary. Using the
overlapping photometry and spectroscopy sample we are able to map an empirical
omega Cen instability strip. This can be directly compared to the pulsation
driving predicted from the Montreal ""second-generation"" models. We find that
the region where p-mode excitation occurs is bifurcated, and the well-known
instability strip between 29,000-36,000 K where the rapid subdwarf B pulsators
are found is complemented by a second one above 50,000 K. While significant
challenges remain at the quantitative level, we believe that the same
kappa-mechanism that drives the pulsations in hot B subdwarfs is also
responsible for the excitation of the rapid oscillations observed in the omega
Cen variables.

requisite variety provides a scientific framework for understanding and
analyzing a system's ability to survive and prosper in the face of
environmental challenges. We have developed a generalization of this law to
extend the analysis to systems that must respond to disturbances at multiple
scales. This analysis identifies a necessary tradeoff between scale and
complexity in a multiscale control system. As with Ashby's law, the framework
applies to the characterization of successful biological and social systems in
the context of complex environmental challenges. Here we apply this multiscale
framework to provide a control theoretic understanding of the historical and
increasing need for SOF, as well as conventional military forces. We propose
that the essential role distinction is in the separation between high
complexity fine scale challenges as opposed to large scale challenges. This
leads to a correspondence between the role SOF can best serve and that of the
immune system in complex organisms--namely, the ability to respond to
fine-grained, high-complexity disruptors and preserve tissue health. Much like
a multicellular organism, human civilization is composed of a set of distinct
and heterogeneous social tissues. Responding to disruption and restoring health
in a system with highly diverse local social conditions is an essentially
complex task. SOF have the potential to mitigate against harm without
disrupting normal social tissue behavior. This analysis suggests how SOF might
be leveraged to support global stability and mitigate against cascading crises.

$A+B \rightarrow 0$ in one dimension, with exclusion interaction, results in
logarithmic corrections to the expected power law decay, when the starting
initial condition (i.c.) is periodic. It is well-known that the late-time
density of surviving particles goes as $t^{-1/4}$ with random initial
conditions, and as $t^{-1/2}$ with alternating initial conditions
($ABABAB$...). We show that the decay for periodic i.c.s made of longer blocks

even. By means of first-passage Monte Carlo simulations, and a mapping to a
q-state coarsening model which can be solved in the Independent Interval
Approximation (IIA), we show that the late-time decay of the density of
surviving particles goes as $t^{-1/2}(\log{(t)})^{-1}$ for $n$ even, but as
$t^{-1/2}$ when $n$ is odd. We relate this kinetic symmetry breaking in the
Glauber Ising model. We also see a very slow crossover from a

be from the use of power beaming to transfer energy and accelerate spacecraft.
Applications suggested for power beaming involve launching spacecraft to orbit,
raising satellites to a higher orbit, and interplanetary concepts involving
space-to-space transfers of cargo or passengers. We also quantify beam-driven
launch to the outer solar system, interstellar precursors and ultimately
starships. We estimate the principal observable parameters of power beaming
leakage. Extraterrestrial civilizations would know their power beams could be
observed, and so could put a message on the power beam and broadcast it for our
receipt at little additional energy or cost. By observing leakage from power
beams we may find a message embedded on the beam. Recent observations of the
anomalous star KIC8462852 by the Allen Telescope Array set some limits on
extraterrestrial power beaming in that system. We show that most power beaming
applications commensurate with those suggested for our solar system would be
detectable if using the frequency range monitored by the ATA, and so the lack
of detection is a meaningful, if modest, constraint on extraterrestrial power
beaming in that system. Until more extensive observations are made, the limited
observation time and frequency coverage are not sufficiently broad in frequency
and duration to produce firm conclusions. Such beams would be visible over
large interstellar distances. This implies a new approach to the SETI search:
Instead of focusing on narrowband beacon transmissions generated by another
civilization, look for more powerful beams with much wider bandwidth. This
requires a new approach for their discovery by telescopes on Earth. Further
studies of power beaming applications should be done, which could broaden the
parameter space of observable features we have discussed here.

exoplanets in the era of extremely large telescopes (ELTs), the first paper in
this series established a rigorous, fully polarimetric framework for
determining the science camera (SC) image given a turbulent wavefront and
unknown aberrations in multiple planes the optical system. This article builds
on the structure developed in Paper I in order to rigorously express the
polarimetric SC image in terms of the field impinging on the wavefront sensor
(WFS), thereby providing a direct connection between the measurements made in
both subsystems. This formulation allows the SC image to be written as a
function of the WFS measurements, including the following unknown quantities
which can, in principle, be estimated via statistical inference: the non-common
path aberration (NCPA), WFS gain errors, aberrations downstream of the
beamsplitter, and the planetary image. It is demonstrated that WFS bias error
is mathematically equivalent to NCPA. Thus, with the ability to treat WFS bias
and gains, the method should not be overly sensitive to WFS calibration
problems. Importantly, this formulation includes stochastic processes that
represent noisy measurement of the SC image, noisy WFS measurements, and
high-frequency components of the wavefront to which the WFS is insensitive. It
is shown that wavefront error due to noise in the WFS measurements has a
convenient semi-analytical representation in terms of the WFS measurement
operator's singular functions. Further, the first and second order statistics
of these processes are specified, thereby setting the stage for the application
of statistical inference methods to be describe in later papers in this series.

In models with quenched orbital degrees of freedom, magnetic fluctuations
promote stripe magnetism which induces orbital order. In models with quenched
spin degrees of freedom, charge fluctuations promote spontaneous orbital order
which induces stripe magnetism. Here we develop an unbiased approach, in which
we treat magnetic and orbital fluctuations on equal footing. Key to our
approach is the inclusion of the orbital character of the low-energy electronic
states into renormalization group analysis. Our results show that in systems
with large Fermi energies, such as BaFe2As2, LaFeAsO, and NaFeAs, orbital order
is induced by stripe magnetism. However, in systems with small Fermi energies,

footing. Considering recursive partitioning as an additional degree of freedom,
tasks can be dynamically partitioned or merged at runtime for each available
processor type, exposing additional or reduced degrees of parallelism as
needed. Our simulations reveal that, for a specific class of dense linear
algebra algorithms taken as a driving example, simultaneous decisions on task
scheduling and partitioning yield significant performance gains on two
different heterogeneous platforms: a highly heterogeneous CPU-GPU system and a
low-power asymmetric big.LITTLE ARM platform. The insights extracted from the
framework can be further applied to actual runtime task schedulers in order to
improve performance on current or future architectures and for different
task-parallel codes.

more on the magnetic recording disks, causing severe intertrack interference
(ITI). The multihead multitrack (MHMT) detector is proposed to better combat
ITI. Such a detector, however, has prohibitive implementation complexity. In
this paper we propose to use the reduced-state sequence estimation (RSSE)
algorithm to significantly reduce the complexity, and render MHMT practical. We
first consider a commonly used symmetric two-head two-track (2H2T) channel
model. The effective distance between two input symbols is redefined. It
provides a better distance measure and naturally leads to an unbalanced set
partition tree. Different trellis configurations are obtained based on the
desired performance/complexity tradeoff. Simulation results show that the
reduced MHMT detector can achieve near maximum-likelihood (ML) performance with
a small fraction of the original number of trellis states. Error event analysis
is given to explain the behavior of RSSE algorithm on 2H2T channel. Search
results of dominant RSSE error events for different channel targets are
presented. We also study an asymmetric 2H2T system. The simulation results and
error event analysis show that RSSE is applicable to the asymmetric channel.

proposed for next generation magnetic storage systems. The multihead multitrack
(MHMT) system is characterized by intersymbol interference (ISI) in the
downtrack direction and intertrack interference (ITI) in the crosstrack
direction. Constructing the trellis of a MHMT maximum likelihood (ML) detector
requires knowledge of the ITI, which is generally unknown at the receiver. In
addition, to retain efficiency, the ML detector requires a static estimate of
the ITI, whose true value may in reality vary. In this paper we propose a
modified ML detector on the $n$-head, $n$-track ($n$H$n$T) channel which could
efficiently track the change of ITI, and adapt to new estimates. The trellis
used in the proposed detector is shown to be independent of the ITI level. A
gain loop structure is used to estimate the ITI. Simulation results show that
the proposed detector offers a performance advantage in settings where
complexity constraints limit the traditional ML detector to use a static ITI
estimate.

atomically flat surfaces is essential for enabling epitaxial growth of rutile
transition metal oxide films. The high surface energy of the rutile (001)
surface often leads to surface faceting, which precludes the sputter and
annealing treatment commonly used for the preparation of clean and atomically
flat TiO2(110) substrate surfaces. In this work, we reveal that stable and
atomically flat rutile TiO2(001) surfaces can be prepared with an atomically
ordered reconstructed surface already during a furnace annealing treatment in
air. We tentatively ascribe this result to the decrease in surface energy
associated with the surface reconstruction, which removes the driving force for
faceting. Despite the narrow temperature window where this morphology can
initially be formed, we demonstrate that it persists in homoepitaxial growth of
TiO2(001) thin films. The stabilization of surface reconstructions that prevent
faceting of high-surface-energy crystal faces may offer a promising avenue
towards the realization of a wider range of high quality epitaxial transition
metal oxide heterostructures.

target for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), which can resolve the 1.3 mm
emission from this source on angular scales comparable to that of the general
relativistic shadow. Previous EHT observations have used visibility amplitudes
to infer the morphology of the millimeter-wavelength emission. Potentially much
richer source information is contained in the phases. We report on 1.3 mm phase
information on Sgr A* obtained with the EHT on a total of 13 observing nights
over 4 years. Closure phases, the sum of visibility phases along a closed
triangle of interferometer baselines, are used because they are robust against
phase corruptions introduced by instrumentation and the rapidly variable
atmosphere. The median closure phase on a triangle including telescopes in
California, Hawaii, and Arizona is nonzero. This result conclusively
demonstrates that the millimeter emission is asymmetric on scales of a few
Schwarzschild radii and can be used to break 180-degree rotational ambiguities
inherent from amplitude data alone. The stability of the sign of the closure
phase over most observing nights indicates persistent asymmetry in the image of
Sgr A* that is not obscured by refraction due to interstellar electrons along
the line of sight.

processes, which reduce their sample space as they unfold, lead to exact
scaling laws in frequency and rank distributions. Such Sample Space Reducing
processes (SSRP) offer an alternative new mechanism to understand the emergence
of scaling in countless processes. The corresponding power law exponents were
shown to be related to noise levels in the process. Here we show that the
emergence of scaling is not limited to the simplest SSRPs, but holds for a huge
domain of stochastic processes that are characterized by non-uniform prior
distributions. We demonstrate mathematically that in the absence of noise the
scaling exponents converge to $-1$ (Zipf's law) for almost all prior
distributions. As a consequence it becomes possible to fully understand
targeted diffusion on weighted directed networks and its associated scaling
laws law in node visit distributions. The presence of cycles can be properly
interpreted as playing the same role as noise in SSRPs and, accordingly,
determine the scaling exponents. The result that Zipf's law emerges as a
generic feature of diffusion on networks, regardless of its details, and that
the exponent of visiting times is related to the amount of cycles in a network
could be relevant for a series of applications in traffic-, transport- and
supply chain management.

quantum gases in the limit of extreme population imbalance where the minority
species has but a single particle. We consider the situation where the gas is
prepared in a state with a single spatially localized exciton: the single
particle of the minority species is spatially localized while the density of
the majority species in the vicinity of the minority particle sees a
depression. Remarkably, we are able to consider cases where the gas contains on
the order of $N=100$ particles, comparable to that studied in experiments on
cold atomic gases. We are able to do by exploiting the integrability of the gas
together with the observation that the excitonic state can be constructed
through a simple superposition of exact eigenstates of the gas. The number of
states in this superposition, rather than being exponentially large in the
number of particles, scales linearly with $N$.
  We study the evolution of such spatially localized states in both strongly
interacting Bose and Fermi gases. The behavior of the light cones when the
interaction strength and density of the gas is varied can be understood from
exact results for the spin excitation spectrum in these systems. We argue that
the light cone in both cases exhibits scaling collapse. However unique to the
Bose gas, we show that the presence of gapped finite-momentum roton-like
excitations provide the Bose gas dynamics with secondary light cones.

rendered by the multiple number of DPs in the compounds. We show that along
three unit axes of the cubic lattice there exist three pairs of DPs, which are
linked by Fermi arcs on the surface. The Fermi arcs display a Lifshitz
transition from a heart- to a diamond-shape upon varying the chemical

proposed, named as Fog Radio Access Network (F-RAN). Compared to C-RAN, the
Radio Units (RUs) in F-CAN are equipped with local caches, which can store some
frequently requested files. In the downlink, users requesting the same file
form a multicast group, and are cooperatively served by a cluster of RUs. The
requested file is either available locally in the cache of this cluster or
fetched from the Central Processor (CP) via backhauls. Thus caching some
frequently requested files can greatly reduce the burden on backhaul links.
Whether a specific RU should be involved in a cluster to serve a multicast
group depends on its backhaul capacity, requested files, cached files and the
channel. Therefore it is subject to optimization. In this paper we investigate
the joint design of multicast beamforming, dynamic clustering and backhaul
traffic balancing. Beamforming and clustering are jointly optimized in order to
minimize the power consumed, while QoS of each user is to be met and the
traffic on each backhaul link is balanced according to its capacity.

allowed to continuously monitor the result and make decision in real time. Many
people see this restriction as a setback against the trend in the technology
toward real time data analytics. Recently, Bayesian Hypothesis Testing, which
intuitively is more suitable for real time decision making, attracted growing
interest as an alternative to NHST. While corrections of NHST for the
continuous monitoring setting are well established in the existing literature
and known in A/B testing community, the debate over the issue of whether
continuous monitoring is a proper practice in Bayesian testing exists among
both academic researchers and general practitioners. In this paper, we formally
prove the validity of Bayesian testing with continuous monitoring when proper
stopping rules are used, and illustrate the theoretical results with concrete

rules are not proper and also compare our methodology to NHST corrections.

was a merger of binary black holes whose masses are $36^{+5}_{-4}M_{\odot}$ and
$29^{+4}_{-4}M_{\odot}$. Such binary systems are expected to be directly
evolved from stellar binary systems or formed by dynamical interactions of
black holes in dense stellar environments. Here we derive the binary black hole
merger rate based on the nearby ultra-luminous X-ray source (ULX) luminosity
function (LF) under the assumption that binary black holes evolve through X-ray
emitting phases. We obtain the binary black hole merger rate as $5.8 ({t}_{\rm

yr^{-1}}$, where $t_{\rm ULX}$ is the typical duration of the ULX phase and
$\lambda$ is the Eddington ratio in luminosity. This is coincident with the
event rate inferred from the detection of GW150914 as well as the predictions
based on binary population synthesis models. Although we are currently unable
to constrain the Eddington ratio of ULXs in luminosity due to the uncertainties
of our models and measured binary black hole merger event rates, further X-ray
and GW data will allow us to narrow down the range of the Eddington ratios of
ULXs. We also find the cumulative merger rate for the mass range of
$5M_\odot\le M_{\rm BH}\le100M_\odot$ inferred from the ULX LF is consistent
with that estimated by the aLIGO collaboration considering various
astrophysical conditions such as the mass function of black holes.

framework, referred to as ""Lexis"", that produces an optimized hierarchical
representation of a given set of ""target"" strings. The resulting hierarchy,
""Lexis-DAG"", shows how to construct each target through the concatenation of
intermediate substrings, minimizing the total number of such concatenations or
DAG edges. The Lexis optimization problem is related to the smallest grammar
problem. After we prove its NP-Hardness for two cost formulations, we propose
an efficient greedy algorithm for the construction of Lexis-DAGs. We also
consider the problem of identifying the set of intermediate nodes (substrings)
that collectively form the ""core"" of a Lexis-DAG, which is important in the
analysis of Lexis-DAGs. We show that the Lexis framework can be applied in
diverse applications such as optimized synthesis of DNA fragments in genomic
libraries, hierarchical structure discovery in protein sequences,
dictionary-based text compression, and feature extraction from a set of
documents.

classical kernel CCA. The principles we describe also apply to many kernel
methods which must deal with the issue of kernel CO or kernel CCO. Experiments

To enter one phase from the other, it is believed that the system must pass
through an exceptional point, which is a non-Hermitian degenerate point with
coalesced eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In this letter we reveal an anomalous
PT transition that takes place away from an exceptional point in a nonlinear
system: as the nonlinearity increases, the original linear system evolves along
two distinct PT-symmetric trajectories, each of which can have an exceptional
point. However, the two trajectories collide and vanish away from these

first illustrate this phenomenon using a coupled mode theory and then exemplify
it using paraxial wave propagation in a transverse periodic potential.

and hydrodynamic instabilities play a crucial role for the explosion mechanism.
First successful neutrino-driven explosions could be obtained with
self-consistent, first-principle simulations in three spatial dimensions (3D).
But 3D models tend to be less prone to explosion than corresponding
axisymmetric (2D) ones. This has been explained by 3D turbulence leading to
energy cascading from large to small spatial scales, inversely to the 2D case,
thus disfavoring the growth of buoyant plumes on the largest scales. Unless the
inertia to explode simply reflects a lack of sufficient resolution in relevant
regions, it suggests that some important aspect may still be missing for robust
and sufficiently energetic neutrino-powered explosions. Such deficits could be
associated with progenitor properties like rotation, magnetic fields or
pre-collapse perturbations, or with microphysics that could lead to an
enhancement of neutrino heating behind the shock. 3D simulations have also
revealed new phenomena that are not present in 2D, for example spiral modes of
the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) and a stunning dipolar
lepton-emission self-sustained asymmetry (LESA). Both impose time- and
direction-dependent variations on the detectable neutrino signal. The
understanding of these effects and of their consequences is still in its
infancy.

Array study of the nuclear radio emission in a representative subset of the
Atlas3D survey of early-type galaxies (ETGs). We find that 51 +/- 4% of the
ETGs in our sample contain nuclear radio emission with luminosities as low as
10^18 W/Hz. Most of the nuclear radio sources have compact (< 25-110 pc)
morphologies, although < 10% display multi-component core+jet or extended
jet/lobe structures. Based on the radio continuum properties, as well as
optical emission line diagnostics and the nuclear X-ray properties, we conclude
that the majority of the central 5 GHz sources detected in the Atlas3D galaxies
are associated with the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). However,
even at sub-arcsecond spatial resolution, the nuclear radio emission in some
cases appears to arise from low-level nuclear star formation rather than an
AGN, particularly when molecular gas and a young central stellar population is
present. This is in contrast to popular assumptions in the literature that the
presence of a compact, unresolved, nuclear radio continuum source universally
signifies the presence of an AGN. Additionally, we examine the relationships
between the 5 GHz luminosity and various galaxy properties including the
molecular gas mass and - for the first time - the global kinematic state. We
discuss implications for the growth, triggering, and fueling of radio AGNs, as
well as AGN-driven feedback in the continued evolution of nearby ETGs.

limiting cases: spatially-resolved stellar populations in the color-magnitude

two extremes lies the semi-resolved regime, which encompasses a rich and
relatively unexplored realm of observational phenomena. Here we develop the
concept of pixel color magnitude diagrams (pCMDs) as a powerful technique for
analyzing stellar populations in the semi-resolved regime. pCMDs show the
distribution of imaging data in the plane of pixel luminosity vs. pixel color.
A key feature of pCMDs is that they are sensitive to all stars, including both
the evolved giants and the unevolved main sequence stars. An important variable
in this regime is the mean number of stars per pixel, $N_{\rm pix}$. Simulated
pCMDs demonstrate a strong sensitivity to the star formation history (SFH) and
allow one to break degeneracies between age, metallicity and dust based on two
filter data for values of $N_{\rm pix}$ up to at least $10^4$. We extract pCMDs
from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical imaging of M31 and derive
non-parametric SFHs from $10^6$ yr to $10^{10}$ yr for both the crowded disk
and bulge regions (where $N_{\rm pix}\approx30-10^3$). From analyzing a small
region of the disk we find a non-parametric SFH that is smooth and consistent
with an exponential decay timescale of 4 Gyr. The bulge SFH is also smooth and
consistent with a 2 Gyr decay timescale. pCMDs will likely play an important
role in maximizing the science returns from next generation ground and
space-based facilities.

black holes (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. A viable scenario for this process
assumes infall of a massive gas cloud towards the SMBH and subsequent formation
of a dense accretion disc which gives birth to the young stars. Numerical
hydrodynamical models indicate that this star formation process is rather fast
and it precedes full circularization of the accretion flow, i.e. the new stars
are born on elliptic orbits. By means of direct numerical N-body modeling, we
show in this paper that the non-zero eccentricity of the stellar discs around
the SMBH leads to an onset of various types of the Kozai-Lidov oscillations of
a non-negligible subset of individual orbits in the disc, showing a remarkable
robustness of this classical mechanism. Among others, we demonstrate that under
certain circumstances, presence of an additional spherical cluster (which is
generally known to damp Kozai-Lidov oscillations) may trigger such oscillations
due to affecting the internal flow of the angular momentum through the disc. We
conclude that the Kozai-Lidov oscillations are capable to substantially modify
the initial structure of the disc (its thickness and distribution of
eccentricities, in particular).

diagnostic of a post-runaway O2-dominated atmosphere from massive H-escape. We
find that for these false positive scenarios, CO at 2.35 um, CO2 at 2.0 and 4.3

interferometry have revealed parsec-sized dust emission elongated in the polar
direction in four sources.
  Aims. Using a larger, coherently analyzed sample of AGN observed with MIR
interferometry, we aim to identify elongated mid-infrared emission in a
statistical sample of sources. More specifically we wish to determine if there
is indeed a preferred direction of the elongation and whether this direction is
consistent with a torus-like structure or with a polar emission.
  Methods. We investigate the significance of the detection of an elongated
shape in the MIR emission by fitting elongated Gaussian models to the
interferometric data at 12 um. We pay special attention to 1) the uncertainties
caused by an inhomogeneous (u,v) coverage, 2) the typical errors in the
measurements and 3) the spatial resolution achieved for each object.
  Results. From our sample of 23 sources we are able to find elongated
parsec-scale MIR emission in five sources: three type 2s, one type 1i and one
type 1. Elongated emission in four of these sources has been published before;
NGC5506 is a new detection. The observed axis ratios are typically around 2 and
the position angle of the 12 um emission for all the elongated sources seems to
be always closer to the polar axis of the system than to the equatorial axis.
Two other objects, NGC4507 and MCG-5-23-16 with a reasonably well mapped (u,v)
coverage and good signal-to-noise ratios, appear to have a less elongated 12 um
emission.
  Conclusions. Our finding that sources showing elongated mid-infrared emission
are preferentially extended in polar direction sets strong constraints on torus
models or implies that both the torus and the NLR/outflow region have to be
modeled together. Especially also models used for SED fitting will have to be
revised to include emission from polar dust.

the two classes of branes is exactly the same as they allow for the same

the UV the associated dual QFTs are different, they flow in the IR to the same
fixed point. The calculation of the shear viscosity to entropy ratio $\eta/s$
confirms these results. Despite the GB dual plasma has in general a
non-universal temperature-dependent $\eta/s$, it flows monotonically to the
universal value $1/4\pi$ in the IR. For negative (positive) GB coupling
constant, $\eta/s$ is an increasing (decreasing) function of the temperature
and the flow respects (violates) the KSS bound.

transaction values across all 573 Parliamentary Constituencies in England and
Wales, finding that scaling models based on population density provided a far
superior framework to traditional population scaling. We found four types of
scaling: i) non-urban scaling in which a single power law explained the
relationship between the metrics and population density from the most rural to
heavily urban environments, ii) accelerated scaling in which high population
density was associated with an increase in the power-law exponent, iii)
inhibited scaling where the urban environment resulted in a reduction in the
power-law exponent but remained positive, and iv) collapsed scaling where
transition to the high density environment resulted in a negative scaling
exponent. Urban scaling transitions, when observed, took place universally
between 10 and 70 people per hectare. This study significantly refines our
understanding of urban scaling, making clear that some of what has been
previously ascribed to urban environments may simply be the high density
portion of non-urban scaling. It also makes clear that some metrics undergo
specific transitions in urban environments and these transitions can include
negative scaling exponents indicative of collapse. This study gives promise of
far more sophisticated scale adjusted metrics and indicates that studies of
urban scaling represent a high density subsection of overall scaling

the influence of fermionic degrees of freedom on the dynamics of inflaton
fluctuations as a possible source of violations of (nearly) scale invariance on
cosmological scales. We obtain the non-equilibrium effective action of an
inflaton-like scalar field with Yukawa interactions ($Y_{D,M}$) to light
\emph{fermionic} degrees of freedom both for Dirac and Majorana fields in de
Sitter space-time. The effective action leads to Langevin equations of motion
for the fluctuations of the inflaton-like field, with self-energy corrections
and a stochastic gaussian noise. We solve the Langevin equation in the
super-Hubble limit implementing a dynamical renormalization group resummation.
For a nearly massless inflaton its power spectrum of super Hubble fluctuations
is \emph{enhanced}, $\mathcal{P}(k;\eta) =
(\frac{H}{2\pi})^2\,e^{\gamma_t[-k\eta] }$ with $\gamma_t[-k\eta] =
\frac{1}{6\pi^2}

\ln[-k\eta]\ln[ -k\eta_0] \Big\} $ for $N_D$ Dirac and $N_M$ Majorana fermions,
and $\eta_0$ is the renormalization scale at which the inflaton mass vanishes.
The full power spectrum is shown to be renormalization group invariant. These
corrections to the super-Hubble power spectrum entail a violation of scale
invariance as a consequence of the coupling to the fermionic fields. The
effective action is argued to be \emph{exact} in a limit of large number of
fermionic fields. A cancellation between the enhancement from fermionic degrees
of freedom and suppression from light scalar degrees of freedom
\emph{conformally coupled to gravity} suggests the possibility of a finely
tuned \emph{supersymmetry} among these fields.

canonical height (and its local counterpart) takes rational values at points of
an elliptic curve over a function field k of transcendence degree 1 over an
algebraically closed field K of characteristic 0. More generally, we
investigate the mechanism for which the local canonical height for a rational
function f defined over k can take irrational values (at points in a local
completion of k), providing examples in all degrees greater than 1. Building on
Kiwi's classification of non-archimedean Julia sets for quadratic maps, we give
a complete answer in degree 2 characterizing the existence of points with
irrational local canonical heights. As an application of our results, we prove
that if the canonical heights of two points a and b under the action of two
rational functions f and g (defined over k) are positive rational numbers, and
if the degrees of f and g are multiplicatively independent, then the orbit of a
under f intersects the orbit of b under g in at most finitely many points,
complementing the results of Ghioca-Tucker-Zieve.

with remarkable torsional stiffness. The collective dynamics of these clouds
can be described in terms of electronic vibrational quanta, which we name
torsitons. It is shown that the group velocity of the wavepacket of torsitons
is much higher than the typical speed of sound, because of the small mass of
participating electrons compared to the atomic mass. For the same reason the
maximum energy of the torsitons in cumulenes is as high as a few electronvolts,
while the minimum possible energy is evaluated as a few hundred wavenumbers and
this minimum is associated with asymmetry of zero point atomic vibrations.
Molecular systems for experimental evaluation of the predictions are proposed.

no flow control, dye injected on top of the packing gets drawn into the grains,
at a rate that increases as the hopper empties. Thus we conclude that the surge
is caused by a self-generated pumping of fluid through the packing. We
successfully model this effect via a driving pressure set by the dilation of

interstitial fluid plays in setting the discharge rate, and likely also in
controlling clog formation, for granular hoppers whether in air or under water.

place micron-sized particles with ""Saturn ring"" defects near a wall with hills

strong splay distortion at the wall interacts with the distortion around the
particles in the near field and favors their migration towards the dales via
the so-called ""lock-and-key"" mechanism. We demonstrate experimentally that the
lock-and-key mechanism can robustly localize a particle at specific

range of parameters that favor or disfavor the docking event, thus exploiting
the capabilities of our experimental system. We extend the study to colloids
with homeotropic anchoring but with an associated point defect instead of a
Saturn ring and show that they find a different preferred location, i.e. we can
place otherwise identical particles at well defined sites according to their
topological defect structure. Finally, for deep enough wells, confinement
drives topological transitions of Saturn rings to dipoles. This ability to
tailor wall geometry to guide colloids to well defined sites within nematic

spaces of two current state-of-the-art systems, SPR and Prophet, with 16
different search space configurations. Our results are derived from an analysis
of 1104 different search spaces and 768 patch generation executions. Together
these experiments consumed over 9000 hours of CPU time on Amazon EC2.
  The analysis shows that 1) correct patches are sparse in the search spaces
(typically at most one correct patch per search space per defect), 2) incorrect
patches that nevertheless pass all of the test cases in the validation test
suite are typically orders of magnitude more abundant, and 3) leveraging
information other than the test suite is therefore critical for enabling the
system to successfully isolate correct patches.
  We also characterize a key tradeoff in the structure of the search spaces.
Larger and richer search spaces that contain correct patches for more defects
can actually cause systems to find fewer, not more, correct patches. We
identify two reasons for this phenomenon: 1) increased validation times because
of the presence of more candidate patches and 2) more incorrect patches that
pass the test suite and block the discovery of correct patches. These
fundamental properties, which are all characterized for the first time in this

help identify challenges, opportunities, and productive future directions for
the field.

Specificity between components may arise from a wide variety of physical and

shape-sensitive depletion interactions. Despite this diversity, all systems
that rely on interaction specificity operate under the constraint that
increasing the number of distinct components inevitably increases off-target
binding. Here we introduce `capacity', the maximal information encodable using
specific interactions, to compare specificity across diverse experimental
systems, and to compute how specificity changes with physical parameters. Using
this framework, we find that `shape'-coding of interactions has higher capacity
than chemical (`color') coding because the strength of off-target binding is
strongly sublinear in binding site size for shapes while being linear for
colors. We also find that different specificity mechanisms, such as shape and
color, can be combined in a synergistic manner, giving a capacity greater than
the sum of the parts.

key biophysical elements that determine the dynamics of these assemblies, which
include the polymerization and depolymerization kinetics of fibers, their
interactions with molecular motors and other objects, their flexibility, and
hydrodynamic coupling.
  This work, to our knowledge, is the first technique to include many-body
hydrodynamic interactions (HIs), and the resulting fluid flows, in cellular
fiber assemblies. We use the non-local slender body theory to compute the
fluid-structure interactions of the fibers and a second-kind boundary integral
formulation for other rigid bodies and the confining boundary. A
kernel-independent implementation of the fast multiple method is utilized for
efficient evaluation of HIs. The deformation of the fibers is described by the
nonlinear Euler--Bernoulli beam theory and their polymerization is modeled by
the reparametrization of the dynamic equations in the appropriate
non-Lagrangian frame. We use a pseudo-spectral representation of fiber
positions and implicit HIs in the time-stepping to resolve large fiber
deformations, and to allow time-steps not constrained by temporal stiffness or
fiber-fiber interactions. The entire computational scheme is parallelized,
which enables simulating assemblies of thousands of fibers. We use our method
to investigate two important questions in the mechanics of cell division: (i)
the effect of confinement on the hydrodynamic mobility of microtubule asters;
and (ii) the dynamics of the positioning of mitotic spindle in complex cell

fluorescence in the presence of a single base pair mismatch. The apparent
displacement rate varied significantly when the mismatch was introduced in the

invader was encountered earlier in displacement. Our data indicate that a
single base pair mismatch in the invader stalls branch migration, and
displacement occurs via direct dissociation of the destabilized incumbent

dissociation into a model, which we term, the concurrent displacement model,

epidemics at national level, due to their epidemiological nature and their
ability to simultaneously estimate prevalence, incidence, and mortality rates.
Recently, HIV interventions and policies have required more information at
sub-national and sub-population levels to support local planning, decision
making and resource allocation. Unfortunately, many areas and high-risk groups
lack sufficient data for deriving stable and reliable results, and this is a
critical technical barrier to more stratified estimates. One solution is to
borrow information from other areas and groups within the same country.
However, directly assuming hierarchical structures within the HIV dynamic
models is complicated and computationally time consuming. In this paper, we
propose a simple and innovative way to incorporate the hierarchical information
into the dynamic systems by using auxiliary data. The proposed method
efficiently uses information from multiple areas and risk groups within each
country without increasing the computational burden. As a result, the new model
improves predictive ability in general with especially significant improvement
in areas and risk groups with sparse data.

take into account an observer-independent length scale and the speed of light

formulated on the de Sitter and also recently proposed anti-de Sitter momentum
spaces. In the context of these theories, we study the statistical mechanics
and to do this, we consider the natural measure on the corresponding extended
phase space. The invariant measure on the space of distinct microstates is
obtained by restriction of the natural measure of the extended phase space to
the physical phase space through the disintegration theorem. Having the
invariant measure, one can study the statistical mechanics in an arbitrary
ensemble for any doubly special relativity theory. We use the constructed setup
to study the statistical properties of four doubly special relativity models.
Applying the results to the case of early universe thermodynamics, we show that
one of these models that is defined by the cosmological coordinatization of
anti-de Sitter momentum space, implies a finite total number of microstates.
Therefore, without attribution to any ensemble density and quite generally, we
obtain entropy and internal energy bounds for the early radiation dominated
universe. We find that while these results cannot be supported by the standard
Friedmann equations, they indeed are in complete agreement with the nonsingular
effective Friedmann equations that arise in the context of loop quantum
cosmology.

along the laser polarization direction. This transverse backward-scattering
process is closely related to a family of photoelectrons initially ionized
within a time interval of less than 200 attosecond around the crest of the
laser electric field. Those electrons, acquiring near-zero return energy in the
laser field, will be pulled back solely by the ionic Coulomb field and
backscattered in the transverse direction. Moreover, this rescattering process
mainly occurs at the first or the second return times, giving rise to different
phases of the photoelectrons. The interference between these photoelectrons
leads to unique curved interference fringes which are observable for most
current intense field experiments, opening a new way to record the electron
dynamics in atoms and molecules on a time scale much shorter than an optical

goal. A military strategy typically employs the threat or use of military force
in opposition to an adversary, and is called upon where large scale force is
viewed as the way to achieve such goals. Strategic thinking is traditionally
focused on which part or combination of land, air, and naval forces is most
effective. This may be too narrow an approach to accomplishing the ultimate
end, which is generally political influence or control--or preventing influence
or control by others--and almost never consists of physical destruction itself.
In order to broaden the discussion of military strategy, we consider here three
distinct effects of inflicting stress on an opponent: a) A fragile system is
damaged--possibly catastrophically, b) A robust system is largely unaffected,
retaining much or all of its prior strength, c) Some systems actually gain
strength, a property which has recently been termed antifragility. Traditional
perspectives of military strategy implicitly assume fragility, limiting their
validity and resulting in surprise, and assume a specific end state rather than
an overall condition of the system as a goal. Robustness and antifragility are
relevant both to offense and defense. While robustness and antifragility are
desirable in friendly systems, an enemy possessing these characteristics
undermines the premise that an attack will achieve a desired increase in
control. Historical and contemporary examples demonstrate the failure of
traditional strategies against antifragile enemies--even devastating damage
inflicted upon nations or other organizations did not weaken and defeat them,
but rather strengthened them, resulting in their victory. Underlying such
successful responses are socio-economic or political strengths. Our discussion
is a basis for scientific analysis of improved strategic thinking.

this traffic. In this paper, we focus on the design of a very efficient massive
access strategy for highly dense cellular networks with M2M communications.
Several MTC devices are allowed to simultaneously transmit at the same resource
block by incorporating Raptor codes and superposition modulation. This
significantly reduces the access delay and improves the achievable system
throughput. A simple yet efficient random access strategy is proposed to only
detect the selected preambles and the number of devices which have chosen them.
No device identification is needed in the random access phase which
significantly reduces the signalling overhead. The proposed scheme is analyzed
and the maximum number of MTC devices that can be supported in a resource block
is characterized as a function of the message length, number of available
resources, and the number of preambles. Simulation results show that the
proposed scheme can effectively support a massive number of MTC devices for a
limited number of available resources, when the message size is small.

astrometrically induced transit timing variations for exterior transiting

hot Jupiters, and their presence can thus be used to test planetary formation
theories. We outline the prospects for detecting non-transiting hot Jupiters

general degree with respect to neat arithmetic subgroups. The formula was
conjectured before by several researchers. The dimensions are expressed by
special values of Shintani zeta functions for spaces of symmetric matrices at
non-positive integers. This formula was given by Shintani for only a small part
of the geometric side of the trace formula. To be precise, it is the
contribution of unipotent elements corresponding to the partitions
$(2^j,1^{2n-2j})$, where $n$ denotes the degree and $0\leq j \leq n$. Hence,
our work is to show that all the other contributions vanish. In addition, one
finds that Shintani's formula means the dimension itself. Combining our formula
and an explicit formula of the Shintani zeta functions, which was discovered by
Ibukiyama and Saito, we can derive an explicit dimension formula for the
principal congruence subgroups of level greater than two. In this explicit

new result we establish for a very general class of urn models. More
specifically, we study attraction properties of urns composed of balls with two
distinct colors which evolve as follows. At each stage a ball is extracted. The
probability of picking a ball of a certain color evolves in time. This
evolution may depend not only on the composition of the urn but also on
external factors or internal ones depending on the history of the urn. A
particular example of the latter is when the reinforcement is a function of the

  Quantitative Problems Involving Strong Alternative Conceptions",,,"10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.11.029901",,"physics.ed-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well-known that introductory physics students often have alternative
conceptions that are inconsistent with established physical principles and
concepts. Invoking alternative conceptions in quantitative problem-solving
process can derail the entire process. In order to help students solve
quantitative problems involving strong alternative conceptions correctly,
appropriate scaffolding support can be helpful. The goal of this study is to
examine how different scaffolding supports involving analogical problem solving
influence introductory physics students' performance on a target quantitative
problem in a situation where many students' solution process is derailed due to
alternative conceptions. Three different scaffolding supports were designed and
implemented in calculus-based and algebra-based introductory physics courses to
evaluate the level of scaffolding needed to help students learn from an
analogical problem that is similar in the underlying principles but for which
the problem solving process is not derailed by alternative conceptions. We
found that for the quantitative problem involving strong alternative
conceptions, simply guiding students to work through the solution of the
analogical problem first was not enough to help most students discern the
similarity between the two problems. However, if additional scaffolding
supports that directly helped students examine and repair their knowledge
elements involving alternative conceptions were provided, students were more
likely to discern the underlying similarities between the problems and avoid
getting derailed by alternative conceptions when solving the targeted problem.
We also found that some scaffolding supports were more effective in the
calculus-based course than in the algebra-based course. This finding emphasizes
the fact that appropriate scaffolding support must be determined via research
in order to be effective.

R-stratified or guarded existential rules with stratified negations, both the
data complexity and combined complexity of query answering under the rule
{repair semantics} remain the same as that under the conventional query

two-speaker acoustic scenario, relying on microphone array recordings from a
binaural hearing aid, which are complemented with electroencephalography (EEG)
recordings to infer the speaker of interest. METHODS: In this study, we propose
a modular processing flow that first extracts the two speech envelopes from the
microphone recordings, then selects the attended speech envelope based on the
EEG, and finally uses this envelope to inform a multi-channel speech separation
and denoising algorithm. RESULTS: Strong suppression of interfering
(unattended) speech and background noise is achieved, while the attended speech
is preserved. Furthermore, EEG-based auditory attention detection (AAD) is
shown to be robust to the use of noisy speech signals. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
show that AAD-based speaker extraction from microphone array recordings is
feasible and robust, even in noisy acoustic environments, and without access to
the clean speech signals to perform EEG-based AAD. SIGNIFICANCE: Current
research on AAD always assumes the availability of the clean speech signals,
which limits the applicability in real settings. We have extended this research
to detect the attended speaker even when only microphone recordings with noisy
speech mixtures are available. This is an enabling ingredient for new
brain-computer interfaces and effective filtering schemes in neuro-steered

be challenging for introductory students from previous research. In addition to
the solved problem, students also received extra scaffolding supports that were
intended to help them discern and exploit the underlying similarities of the

great difficulty in transferring what they learned from a 2-step problem to a
3-step problem. Although most students were able to learn from the solved

principles in the quiz problem, they were not necessarily able to apply the

that students often superficially mapped the principles employed in the solved

vertex is equipped with a weight drawn from a power-law distribution, and two
vertices form an edge independently with probability proportional to the
product of their weights. Chung-Lu graphs have average distance O(log log n)
and thus reproduce the small-world phenomenon, a key property of real-world
networks. Modern, more realistic variants of this model also equip each vertex
with a random position in a specific underlying geometry. The edge probability
of two vertices then depends, say, inversely polynomial on their distance.
  In this paper we study a generic augmented version of Chung-Lu random graphs.
We analyze a model where the edge probability of two vertices can depend
arbitrarily on their positions, as long as the marginal probability of forming
an edge (for two vertices with fixed weights, one fixed position, and one
random position) is as in Chung-Lu random graphs. The resulting class contains
Chung-Lu random graphs, hyperbolic random graphs, and geometric inhomogeneous
random graphs as special cases.
  Our main result is that every random graph model in this general class has
the same average distance as Chung-Lu random graphs, up to a factor 1+o(1).
This shows in particular that specific choices, such as the underlying geometry
being Euclidean or the dependence on the distance being inversely polynomial,
do not significantly influence the average distance. The proof also yields that
our model has a giant component and polylogarithmic diameter with high
probability.

the fundamental postulate of the Unified Growth Theory about the existence of

In particular, there was no escape from the Malthusian trap because there was
no trap. Economic growth in all these regions was not stagnant but hyperbolic.
Unified Growth Theory is fundamentally incorrect. However, this theory is also
dangerously misleading because it claims a transition from the endless epoch of
stagnation to the new era of sustained economic growth, the interpretation
creating the sense of security and a promise of prosperity. The data show that
the opposite is true. Economic growth in the past was sustained and secure.
Now, it is supported by the increasing ecological deficit. The long-term
sustained and secure economic growth has yet to be created. It did not happen
automatically, as suggested incorrectly by the Unified Growth Theory.

$Y\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$, $A \in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, and
$X\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times p}$. The matrix $Y$ is observed, and $A, X, E$ are
unknown. Here $E$ is ""noise"" of small norm, and $X$ is column-wise sparse. The
matrix $A$ is referred to as a {\em dictionary}, and its columns as {\em
atoms}. Then, given some small number $p$ of samples, i.e.\ columns of $Y$, the
goal is to learn the dictionary $A$ up to small error, as well as $X$. The
motivation is that in many applications data is expected to sparse when
represented by atoms in the ""right"" dictionary $A$ (e.g.\ images in the Haar
wavelet basis), and the goal is to learn $A$ from the data to then use it for
other applications.
  Recently, [SWW12] proposed the dictionary learning algorithm ER-SpUD with
provable guarantees when $E = 0$ and $m = n$. They showed if $X$ has
independent entries with an expected $s$ non-zeroes per column for $1 \lesssim
s \lesssim \sqrt{n}$, and with non-zero entries being subgaussian, then for
$p\gtrsim n^2\log^2 n$ with high probability ER-SpUD outputs matrices $A', X'$
which equal $A, X$ up to permuting and scaling columns (resp.\ rows) of $A$
(resp.\ $X$). They conjectured $p\gtrsim n\log n$ suffices, which they showed
was information theoretically necessary for {\em any} algorithm to succeed when
$s \simeq 1$. Significant progress was later obtained in [LV15].
  We show that for a slight variant of ER-SpUD, $p\gtrsim n\log(n/\delta)$
samples suffice for successful recovery with probability $1-\delta$. We also
show that for the unmodified ER-SpUD, $p\gtrsim n^{1.99}$ samples are required
even to learn $A, X$ with polynomially small success probability. This resolves
the main conjecture of [SWW12], and contradicts the main result of [LV15],
which claimed that $p\gtrsim n\log^4 n$ guarantees success whp.

itself in the non-equilibrium relaxation process. While the critical behavior
is dictated by the low-lying energy levels of the Hamiltonian, the dissipative
part in the Lindblad equation also plays important roles in two aspects: First,
the dissipative part makes the high energy levels decay fast after which the
universal behavior controlled by the low-lying modes emerges. Second, the
dissipation rate gives rise to a time scale that affects the scaling behavior.
We confirm our theory by solving the Lindblad equation for the one-dimensional

the goal of helping students develop an expert-like problem solving approach
underlies many TAs' considerations for the use of example solutions. TAs,
however, do not notice and do not use many features described in the research

suffer from the lack of causality in their design. This results in problems
with their implementation and interpretation. Here the method is presented with
causality directly implemented in the design. This is done by, first, building
up a dynamic model of population, postulating existence of Driving Force acting
at subjects, while they move along their cohort lines, causing the changes of
their substantial health indicators , State Variables, at rate proportional to
this Force. The correspondent rates , named Cohort Trends, or C-trends,
describe health history in each birth cohort. Having initial value and C-trends
, the model allows to calculate health level (the means of State Variables) in
each birth cohort, and thus, in the whole population. The task for statistical
method is to identify the dynamic model (evaluate C-trends and Initial values)
using data from a set of consecutive independent cross-sectional surveys. This
is done by an iterative algorithm, running multiple regression procedure at
each step, until the specified smoothing conditions are fulfilled. The
algorithm can operate with surveys having different age ranges. The
illustrative example shows the results of analysis of Body Mass Index for men ,
using 7 surveys in period 1972-2002 with age ranges 25-64 and 25-74. Since
C-Trend is proxy for Driving Force, the year - age pattern of C-Trends provides
unbiased information for health authorities on efficiency of health promotion

infer the downlink covariance based on the observed uplink covariance. This

We first apply an adiabatic approximation on gently curved, planar waveguides

views are complementary: the same variable is regarded in one case as the
energy density of the fluid, in the other as the deformation of the elastic

conventional reach of hydrodynamics. For asymptotically flat charged black
branes (either Reissner-Nordstrom or p-brane-charged black branes) it yields
the non-linear evolution of the Gregory-Laflamme instability at large D and its
endpoint at stable non-uniform black branes. For Reissner-Nordstrom AdS black

strictly positive and zero average diffraction. Our methods allow for a large
class of nonlinearities, they are, for example, allowed to change sign, and the
weakest possible condition, it only has to be locally integrable, on the local
diffraction profile. The solutions are found as minimizers of a nonlinear and
nonlocal variational problem which is translation invariant. There exists a
critical threshold ?cr such that minimizers for this variational problem exist
if their power is bigger than ?cr and no minimizers exist with power less than
the critical threshold. We also give simple criteria for the finiteness and
strict positivity of the critical threshold. Our proof of existence of
minimizers is rather direct and avoids the use of Lions' concentration
compactness argument.
  Furthermore, we give precise quantitative lower bounds on the exponential
decay rate of the diffraction management solitons, which confirm the physical
heuristic prediction for the asymptotic decay rate. Moreover, for ground state
solutions, these bounds give a quantitative lower bound for the divergence of
the exponential decay rate in the limit of vanishing average diffraction. For
zero average diffraction, we prove quantitative bounds which show that the
solitons decay much faster than exponentially. Our results considerably extend

in biology, chemistry, physics, medicine, and engineering. In particular,
systems of ordinary differential equations are commonly used for the
mathematical modelling of the rate of change of dynamic processes. In many
practical applications, the process can only be partially measured, a fact that
renders estimation of parameters of the system extremely challenging. Recently,
a 'direct integral estimator' for partially observed systems of ordinary
differential equations was introduced. The practical performance of the
integral estimator was demonstrated, but its theoretical properties were not
derived. In this paper we use the sieve framework to prove that the estimator
is consistent.

fundamental challenge in empirical research, as failing to do so can produce

a two-step procedure to deal with unobserved spatial heterogeneity, while
accounting for spatial dependence in a cross-sectional setting. The first step
of the procedure takes explicitly unobserved spatial heterogeneity into account
to endogenously identify subsets of farms that follow a similar local
production econometric model, i.e. spatial production regimes. The second step
consists in the specification of a spatial autoregressive model with
autoregressive disturbances and spatial regimes. The method is applied to two
regional samples of olive growing farms in Italy. The main finding is that the
identification of spatial regimes can help drawing a more detailed picture of
the production environment and provide more accurate information to guide

Keplerian) stellar disc orbiting a more massive black hole (MBH). Our recent
work on the general kinetic theory of RR is simplified in the standard manner
by ignoring the effects of `gravitational polarization', and applied to a
zero-thickness, flat, axisymmetric disc. The wake of a stellar orbit is
expressed in terms of the angular momenta exchanged with other orbits, and used
to derive a kinetic equation for RR under the combined actions of self-gravity,
1 PN and 1.5 PN relativistic effects of the MBH and an arbitrary external
axisymmetric potential. This is a Fokker-Planck equation for the stellar
distribution function (DF), wherein the diffusion coefficients are given
self-consistently in terms of contributions from apsidal resonances between
pairs of stellar orbits. The physical kinetics is studied for the two main
cases of interest. (1) `Lossless' discs in which the MBH is not a sink of
stars, and disc mass, angular momentum and energy are conserved: we prove that
general H-functions can increase or decrease during RR, but the Boltzmann
entropy is (essentially) unique in being a non-decreasing function of time.
Therefore secular thermal equilibria are maximum entropy states, with DFs of
the Boltzmann form; the two-Ring correlation function at equilibrium is
computed. (2) Discs that lose stars to the MBH through an `empty loss-cone': we
derive expressions for the MBH feeding rates of mass, angular momentum and
energy in terms of the diffusive flux at the loss-cone boundary.

  process",,,,,"cs.DC math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Information propagation on graphs is a fundamental topic in distributed
computing. One of the simplest models of information propagation is the push
protocol in which at each round each agent independently pushes the current
knowledge to a random neighbour. In this paper we study the so-called
coalescing-branching random walk (COBRA), in which each vertex pushes the
information to $k$ randomly selected neighbours and then stops passing
information until it receives the information again. The aim of COBRA is to
propagate information fast but with a limited number of transmissions per
vertex per step. In this paper we study the cover time of the COBRA process
defined as the minimum time until each vertex has received the information at
least once. Our main result says that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex $r$-regular graph
whose transition matrix has second eigenvalue $\lambda$, then the COBRA cover
time of $G$ is $\mathcal O(\log n )$, if $1-\lambda$ is greater than a positive
constant, and $\mathcal O((\log n)/(1-\lambda)^3))$, if $1-\lambda \gg
\sqrt{\log( n)/n}$. These bounds are independent of $r$ and hold for $3 \le r
\le n-1$. They improve the previous bound of $O(\log^2 n)$ for expander graphs.
Our main tool in analysing the COBRA process is a novel duality relation
between this process and a discrete epidemic process, which we call a biased
infection with persistent source (BIPS). A fixed vertex $v$ is the source of an
infection and remains permanently infected. At each step each vertex $u$ other
than $v$ selects $k$ neighbours, independently and uniformly, and $u$ is
infected in this step if and only if at least one of the selected neighbours
has been infected in the previous step. We show the duality between COBRA and
BIPS which says that the time to infect the whole graph in the BIPS process is
of the same order as the cover time of the COBRA process

astronomical phenomena. In this work, the deflagration phase is simulated for
the first time using multidimensional hydrodynamics, with the aim of gaining
new insight into the explosive deaths of $8-10~M_\odot$ stars and ONeWDs that
accrete material from a binary companion star. The main aim is to determine
whether these events are thermonuclear or core-collapse supernova explosions,
and hence whether NSs are formed by such phenomena. The deflagration is
simulated in ONe cores with three different central ignition densities. The
intermediate density case is perhaps the most realistic, being based on recent
nuclear physics calculations and 1D stellar models. The 3D hydrodynamic
simulations presented in this work begin from a centrally confined flame
structure using a level-set-based flame approach and are performed in $256^3$
and $512^3$ numerical resolutions. In the simulations with intermediate and low
ignition density, the cores do not appear to collapse into NSs. Instead, almost
a solar mass of material becomes unbound from the cores, leaving bound
remnants. These simulations represent the case in which semiconvective mixing
during the electron-capture phase preceding the deflagration is inefficient.
The masses of the bound remnants double when Coulomb corrections are included
in the EoS, however they still do not exceed the effective Chandrasekhar mass
and, hence, would not collapse into NSs. The simulations with the highest
ignition density ($\log_{10}\rho_{\rm c}=10.3$), representing the case where
semiconvective mixing is very efficient, show clear signs that the core will
collapse into a NS.

shapes and relative phase differences of the parent solitons. Localizations of
energies generated from annihilations of mildly and strongly strained soliton
eigenstates were responsible for geometrical (Berry) and topological phase
transitions, respectively. Both contributed to generating a quantum Zeno phase,
whereas only strong twists generated topological (Anderson) localization.
Anti-bunching-like condensation was also observed.

orders of magnitude more than corresponding Josephson parametric amplifiers. We
show that although the active medium, the mechanical resonator, is at a high

data. Estimating the full state can require considerable efforts, but one is
often only interested in a few properties of the state, such as the fidelity
with a target state, or the degree of correlation for a specified bipartite
structure. Rather than first estimating the state, one can, and should,
estimate those quantities of interest directly from the data. We propose the
use of optimal error intervals as a meaningful way of stating the accuracy of
the estimated property values. Optimal error intervals are analogs of the
optimal error regions for state estimation [New J. Phys. 15, 123026 (2013)].
They are optimal in two ways: They have the largest likelihood for the observed
data and the pre-chosen size, and are the smallest for the pre-chosen
probability of containing the true value. As in the state situation, such
optimal error intervals admit a simple description in terms of the marginal
likelihood for the data for the properties of interest. Here, we present the
concept and construction of optimal error intervals, report on an iterative
algorithm for reliable computation of the marginal likelihood (a quantity
difficult to calculate reliably), explain how plausible intervals --- a notion
of evidence provided by the data --- are related to our optimal error
intervals, and illustrate our methods with single-qubit and two-qubit examples.

competitors present their claims for them. Beside a player's natural capacity,
here overconfidence and bluffing may also play a decisive role and influence
how to share a restricted reward. While bluff provides clear, but risky
advantage, overconfidence, as a form of self-deception, could be harmful to its
user. Still, it is a long-standing puzzle why these potentially damaging biases
are maintained and evolving to a high level in the human society. Within the
framework of evolutionary game theory, we present a simple version of resource
competition game in which the coevolution of overconfidence and bluffing is
fundamental, which is capable to explain their prevalence in structured
populations. Interestingly, bluffing seems apt to evolve to higher level than
corresponding overconfidence and in general the former is less resistant to
punishment than the latter. Moreover, topological feature of the social network
plays an intricate role in the spreading of overconfidence and bluffing. While
the heterogeneity of interactions facilitates bluffing, it also increases
efficiency of adequate punishment against overconfident behavior. Furthermore,
increasing the degree of homogeneous networks can trigger similar effect. We
also observed that having high real capability may accommodate both bluffing
ability and overconfidence simultaneously.

which an isolated very-low-mass prestellar core can be formed by colliding
turbulent flows and collapse to form a brown-dwarf. Our simulations suggest
that the flows need not be very fast, but do need to be very strongly
convergent, i.e. the gas must flow in at comparable speeds from all sides,
which seems rather unlikely. We therefore revisit the object Oph-B11, which
Andre, Ward-Thompson and Greaves (2012) have identified as a prestellar core
with mass between $\sim 0.020\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $\sim
0.030\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$. We reanalyse the observations using a Markov-chain
Monte Carlo method that allows us (i) to include the uncertainties on the
distance, temperature and dust mass opacity, and (ii) to consider different
Bayesian prior distributions of the mass. We estimate that the posterior
probability that Oph-B11 has a mass below the hydrogen burning limit at $\sim
0.075\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, is between 0.66 and 0.86. We conclude that, if
Oph-B11 is destined to collapse, it probably will form a brown dwarf. However,
the flows required to trigger this appear to be so contrived that it is
difficult to envisage this being the only way, or even a major way, of forming
isolated brown dwarfs. Moreover, Oph-B11 could easily be a transient, bouncing,
prolate core, seen end-on; there could, indeed should, be many such objects
masquerading as very low-mass prestellar cores.

superconductor with triplet order parameter, can be realized in strong
spin-orbit-coupled quantum wells in proximity to $s$-wave superconductor. It is
revealed that with the singlet order parameter induced from the superconducting
proximity effect, in quantum wells, not only can the triplet pairings arise due
to the spin-orbit coupling, but also the triplet order parameter can be induced
due to the repulsive effective electron-electron interaction, including the
electron-electron Coulomb and electron-phonon interactions. This is a natural
extension of the work of de Gennes, in which the repulsive-interaction-induced
singlet order parameter arises in the normal metal in proximity to $s$-wave
superconductor [Rev. Mod. Phys. {\bf 36}, 225 (1964)]. Specifically, we derive
the effective Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, in which the self-energies due to
the effective electron-electron interactions contribute to the singlet and
triplet order parameters. It is further shown that for the singlet order
parameter, it is efficiently suppressed due to this self-energy
renormalization; whereas for the triplet order parameter, it is the $p$-wave

solver and the gas-kinetic kinetic scheme (GKS) provide a time-accurate flux
function starting from a discontinuous piecewise linear flow distributions
around each cell interface. With the use of time derivative of the flux
function, a two-stage Lax-Wendroff-type (L-W for short) time stepping method
has been recently proposed in the design of a fourth-order time accurate method
[18]. In this paper, based on the same time-stepping method and the
second-order GKS flux function [34], a fourth-order gas-kinetic scheme is
constructed for the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. In comparison with the
formal one-stage time-stepping third-order gas-kinetic solver [21], the current
fourth-order method not only reduces the complexity of the flux function, but
also improves the accuracy of the scheme, even though the third- and
fourth-order schemes have similar computation cost. Most importantly, the
robustness of the fourth-order GKS is as good as the second-order one. Perfect
numerical solutions can be obtained from the high Reynolds number boundary
layer solutions to the hypersonic viscous heat conducting flow computations.
Many numerical tests, including many difficult ones for the Navier-Stokes
solvers, have been used to validate the current fourth-order method. Following
the two-stage time-stepping framework, the one-stage third-order GKS can be
easily extended to a fifth-order method with the usage of both first-order and
second-order time derivatives of the flux function. The use of time-accurate
flux function may have great impact on the development of higher-order CFD
methods.

finite element methods are derived on staggered Cartesian grids for the
solution of the inc.NS equations in two and three space dimensions. Pressure
and velocity are expressed in the form of piecewise polynomials along different
meshes. While the pressure is defined on the control volumes of the main grid,
the velocity components are defined on a spatially staggered mesh. In the first
family, h.o. of accuracy is achieved only in space, while a simple
semi-implicit time discretization is derived for the pressure gradient in the
momentum equation. The resulting linear system for the pressure is symmetric
and positive definite and either block 5-diagonal (2D) or block 7-diagonal (3D)
and can be solved very efficiently by means of a classical matrix-free
conjugate gradient method. The use of a preconditioner was not necessary. This
is a rather unique feature among existing implicit DG schemes for the NS
equations. In order to avoid a stability restriction due to the viscous terms,
the latter are discretized implicitly. The second family of staggered DG
schemes achieves h.o. of accuracy also in time by expressing the numerical
solution in terms of piecewise space-time polynomials. In order to circumvent
the low order of accuracy of the adopted fractional stepping, a simple
iterative Picard procedure is introduced. In this manner, the symmetry and
positive definiteness of the pressure system are not compromised. The resulting
algorithm is stable, computationally very efficient, and at the same time
arbitrary h.o. accurate in both space and time. The new numerical method has
been thoroughly validated for approximation polynomials of degree up to N=11,

problematic, especially when dealing with relaxation to nonequilibrium steady
states. Here, we consider the relaxation of classical, thermostatted particle
systems to equilibrium as well as to nonequilibrium steady states, using
dynamical notions including decay of correlations. We show that the condition
known as {\Omega}T-mixing is necessary and sufficient to prove relaxation of
ensemble averages to steady state values. We then observe that the condition
known as weak T-mixing applied to smooth observables is sufficient for
relaxation to be independent of the initial ensemble. Lastly, weak T-mixing for
integrable functions makes relaxation independent of the ensemble member, apart
from a negligible set of members enabling the result to be applied to
observations from a single physical experiment. The results also allow us to
give a microscopic derivation of Prigogine's principle of minimum entropy
production in the linear response regime. The key to deriving these results
lies in shifting the discussion from characteristics of dynamical systems, such
as those related to metric transitivity, to physical measurements and to the
behaviour of observables. This naturally leads to the notion of physical
ergodicity.

added to the fitting model. This higher order contribution exists both in the
free and reference layers and its sign is opposite to that of the first order

ratios are 0.1 and 0.24 for the free and reference layers, respectively. The
ratio is more than doubled at low temperatures altering the ground state of the
reference layer from 'easy-axis' to 'easy-cone' regime. Easy-cone state has
clear signatures in the shape of the hard-axis magnetoresistance loops. The
same behavior was observed in all measured devices regardless of their

power-law with photon index $\Gamma=6.39^{+0.08}_{-0.02}$ and an additional
hard power law tail ($\Gamma=1.79\pm0.02$). We report on the emergence of a
strong disk-dominated component in the X-ray spectrum and we conclude that the
source has entered the soft state for the first time in its ~10 year prolonged
outburst. Using reasonable estimates for the distance to the source ($3$ kpc)
and black hole mass ($5M_{\odot}$), we find the unabsorbed luminosity (0.1-100
keV) to be $\approx0.60$% of the Eddington luminosity, making this one of the
lowest luminosity soft states recorded in X-ray binaries. We also find that the
accretion disk extended towards the compact object during its transition from
hard to soft, with the inner radius estimated to be
$R_{\mathrm{in}}=28.0^{+0.7}_{-0.4} R_g$ or ~$12R_g$, dependent on the boundary
condition chosen, assuming the above distance and mass, a spectral hardening
factor $f=1.7$ and a binary inclination $i=55^{\circ}$.

probe investigation by NMR and muSR down to 20 mK, we provide a robust evidence
for the absence of magnetic freezing in the ground state. The local spin
susceptibility probed by the NMR shift hardly deviates from the macroscopic one
down to 1 K pointing to a homogeneous magnetic system with a low defect

interest is the setting where the target function is smooth, characterized by a

by a lower (or downward closed) set. By exploiting this fact, we present an
innovative weighted $\ell_1$ minimization procedure with a precise choice of
weights, and a new iterative hard thresholding method, for imposing the
downward closed preference. Theoretical results reveal that our computational
approaches possess a provably reduced sample complexity compared to existing
compressed sensing techniques presented in the literature. In addition, the
recovery of the corresponding best approximation using these methods is
established through an improved bound for the restricted isometry property. Our
analysis represents an extension of the approach for Hadamard matrices in [5]
to the general case of continuous bounded orthonormal systems, quantifies the
dependence of sample complexity on the successful recovery probability, and
provides an estimate on the number of measurements with explicit constants.
Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical results and

sorting procedure increases the between-group behavioural variation well above
what is expected for groups randomly sampled from a population. For a wide
class of group feature models, the individual phenotypes are efficiently sorted

for the sake of reducing the energy dissipated by communications and networking
devices, including the base stations (BSs) and battery-powered user terminals
(UTs). This paper investigates the joint employment of cognition and
cooperation techniques invoked for improving the energy efficiency of cellular
networks. To be specific, the cellular devices first have to identify the
unused spectral bands (known as spectrum holes) using their spectrum sensing
functionality. Then, they cooperate for exploiting the detected spectrum holes
to support energy-efficient cellular communications. Considering the fact that
contemporary terminals (e.g., smart phones) support various wireless access
interfaces, we exploit either the Bluetooth or the Wi-Fi network operating
within the spectrum holes for supporting cellular communications with the
intention of achieving energy savings. This approach is termed as
\emph{cognitive network cooperation}, since different wireless access networks
cognitively cooperate with cellular networks. In order to illustrate the energy
efficiency benefits of using both cognition and cooperation, we study the
cooperation between television stations (TVSs) and BSs in transmitting to UTs
relying on an opportunistic exploitation of the TV spectrum, where the unused
TV spectral band is utilized in an opportunistic way, depending on whether it
is detected to be idle (or not). It is shown that for a given number of
information bits to be transmitted, the total energy consumed is significantly
reduced, when both cognition and cooperation are supported in cellular
networks, as compared to the conventional direct transmission, pure cognition
and pure cooperation.

high sensitivity of the new generation of radio telescopes such as the Square
Kilometre Array (SKA) will provide a density of detected galaxies that is
comparable to that found at optical wavelengths, and with significant source
shape measurements to make large area radio surveys competitive for weak
lensing studies. This will lead weak lensing to become one of the primary
science drivers in radio surveys too, with the advantage that they will access
the largest scales in the Universe going beyond optical surveys, like LSST and
Euclid, in terms of redshifts that are probed. RadioLensfit is an adaptation to
radio data of ""lensfit"", a model-fitting approach for galaxy shear measurement,

working directly in the visibility domain, which is the natural approach to

for claw-free graphs, for $lK_2$-free graphs for any constant $l$
\cite{Aleks1991,FarHujTuz1993,Prisn1995,TsuIdeAriShi1977}, for $K_2$+claw-free
graphs, for $2P_3$-free graphs \cite{LozMos2012}, and solves the open questions
for $2K_2+P_3$-free graphs and for $P_3$+claw-free graphs being two of the
minimal graph classes, defined by forbidding one induced subgraph, for which
the complexity of MWIS was an open problem.

key properties of the dynamics of slowly relaxing materials, such as glasses.
So far kinetic constraints have been introduced in idealised models aiming to
capture specific dynamical properties of these systems. However, recently it
has been experimentally shown by [M. Valado et al., arXiv:1508.04384 (2015)]
that manifest kinetic constraints indeed govern the evolution of strongly
interacting gases of highly excited atoms in a noisy environment. Motivated by
this development we address and discuss the question concerning the type of
kinetically constrained dynamics which can generally emerge in quantum spin
systems subject to strong noise. We discuss an experimentally-realizable case
which displays collective behavior, timescale separation and dynamical

between the fluids, causes the fluid momenta being not aligned with the

all necessary sum rules and in the limit of small relative velocity our results

configurations. Resulting density profiles and moments of inertia are discussed

$\cal{S}_o$ and a given Yang-Mills and Higgs field. If the metric is complete
$Q$ is globally hyperbolic. In case $\cal{S}_o$ is compact we also prove a
spectral resolution of the wave equation and establish sufficient conditions
guaranteeing a mass gap.

magnetar central engine that do not include jets that are expected to be
launched by the magnetar progenitor. I show that under reasonable assumptions
the outflow that is expected during the formation of a magnetar can carry an
amount of energy that does not fall much below, and even surpasses, the energy
that is stored in the newly born spinning neutron star (NS). The rapidly
spinning NS and the strong magnetic fields attributed to magnetars require that
the accreted mass onto the newly born NS possesses high specific angular
momentum and strong magnetic fields. These ingredients are expected, as in many
other astrophysical objects, to form collimated outflows/jets. I argue that the
bipolar outflow in the pre-magnetar phase transfers a substantial amount of
energy to the supernova (SN) ejecta, and it cannot be ignored in models that
attribute SESNe to magnetars. I conclude that jets launched by accretion disks
and accretion belts are more likely to power SESNe than magnetars are. This
conclusion is compatible with the notion that jets might power all core
collapse SNe (CCSNe).

internal momentum (u,p_{{\theta}}), going round in a circle of radius equal to
half the reduced Compton wavelength of electron with tangential velocity c. The
circular momentum p_{{\theta}} and energy u emanate from circular Dirac delta
type rotating monochromatic electromagnetic (EM) wave that itself travels in
another circle having radius equal to the reduced Compton wavelength of
electron. The phenomenon of Zitterbewegung and the spin of electron are the
natural consequences of the model. The spin is associated with the internal
circulating momentum of electron in terms of four component spinor, which leads
to the Dirac equation linking the EM electron model with quantum mechanical
theory. Our model accurately explains the experimental results of electron
channelling experiment, [P. Catillon et al., Found.Phys. 38, 659 (2008)], in

surface are computed, using the interFoam VoF solver of the OpenFOAM CFD
package. Toward the solid surface, the liquid microdroplet is moving with an
impinging gas flow, simulating the situation of ink droplets being deposited
onto substrate with a collimated mist jet in the Optomec Aerosol Jet printing
process. The computed values of maximum spread factor, for the range of
parameters of practical interest to Aerosol Jet printing, were found in very
good agreement with some of the correlation formulas proposed by previous
authors in the literature. Combining formulas selected from different authors
with appropriate modifications yields a maximum spread factor formula that can
be used for first-order evaluations of deposited in droplet size during the
Aerosol Jet technology development. The computational results also illustrate
droplet impact dynamics with lamella shape evolution throughout the spreading,
receding-relaxation, and wetting equilibrium phases, consistent with that
observed and described by many previous authors. This suggests a
scale-invariant nature of the basic droplet impact behavior such that
experiments with larger droplets at the same nondimensional parameter values
may be considered for studying microdroplet impact dynamics. Significant free
surface oscillations can be observed when the droplet viscosity is relatively
low. The border line between periodic free surface oscillations and aperiodic
creeping to capillary equilibrium free surface shape appears at the value of
Ohnesorge number around 0.25. Droplet bouncing after receding is prompted with
large contact angles at solid surface (as consistent with findings reported in
the literature), but can be suppressed by increasing the droplet viscosity.

irradiation, without any electrodes and photocatalysts. A near infrared pulsed
nanosecond laser is used for exposure of colloidal solution of Au nanoparticles
suspended in water. Laser exposure of the colloidal solution results in
formation of plasma of laser breakdown of liquid and emission of H2. The rate
of H2 emission depends critically on the energy of laser pulses. There is a
certain threshold in laser fluence in liquid (around 50 J/cm2) below which
plasma disappears and H2 emission stops. H2 emission from colloidal solution of
Au nanoparticles in ethanol is higher than that from similar water colloid. It
is found that formation of plasma and emission of H2 or D2 can be induced by
laser exposure of pure liquids, either H2O or D2O, respectively. The results
are interpreted as water molecules splitting by direct electron impact from
breakdown plasma.

to overcome the high system complexity of Algebraic Geometric Block Turbo Codes
(AGBTCs) while maintaining a high Bit-Error Rate (BER) performance. This design
is inspired by the idea of unequal protection of information symbols which is
the core of IBTCs. Our experiments conducted over the worst case of fading
channels which is the fast fading channels; and this is done in order to show
the magnitude of gain in BER or the reduction in system complexity that can be
achieved by this design. Our experiments shows that despite a very slight
negative gain over BPSK and QPSK modulation schemes the system complexity is
significantly reduced. However, when applying higher modulation schemes a gain
in both BER and system complexity are achieved.

(with thickness L and diameter D) and hard spheres (with diameter $\sigma$) is
studied by means of Parsons-Lee theory. The isotropic-isotropic demixing, which
is found in mixtures of large spheres and small plates, is very likely to be
preempted by crystallization. In contrast, the nematic-nematic demixing, which
is obtained in mixtures of large plates and small spheres, can be stabilized at
low diameter ratios ($\sigma$/D) and aspect ratios (L/D). At intermediate
values of $\sigma$/D, where the sizes of the components are similar, neither
the isotropic-isotropic nor the nematic-nematic demixing can be stabilized, but
a very strong fractionation takes place between a plate rich nematic and a
sphere rich isotropic phases. Our results show that the excluded volume
interactions are capable alone to explain the experimental observation of the
nematic-nematic demixing, but they fail for the description of
isotropic-isotropic one (Chen et. al., Soft Matter, 11, 5775 (2015)).
