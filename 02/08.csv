estimates of outflow properties than previous observations. We use 13CO(1-0)
and C18O(1-0) emission to correct for the 12CO(1-0) optical depth to accurately
estimate the outflow mass, momentum and kinetic energy. This correction
increases the estimates of the mass, momentum and kinetic energy by factors of
about 9, 5 and 2, respectively, with respect to estimates assuming optically
thin emission. The new 13CO and C18O data also allow us to trace denser and
slower outflow material than that traced by the 12CO maps, and they reveal an
outflow cavity wall at very low velocities (as low as 0.2km/s with respect to
the cores central velocity). Adding with the slower material traced only by
13CO and C18O, there is another factor of 3 increase in the mass estimate and
50% increase in the momentum estimate. The estimated outflow properties
indicate that the outflow is capable of dispersing the parent core within the
typical lifetime of the embedded phase of a low-mass protostar, and that it is
responsible for a core-to-star efficiency of 1/4 to 1/3. We find that the
outflow cavity wall is composed of multiple shells associated with a series of
jet bow-shock events. Within about 3000AU of the protostar the 13CO and C18O
emission trace a circumstellar envelope with both rotation and infall motions,
which we compare with a simple analytic model. The CS(2-1) emission reveals
tentative evidence of a slowly-moving rotating outflow, which we suggest is
entrained not only poloidally but also toroidally by a disk wind that is
launched from relatively large radii from the source.

  Algorithms","16 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The question why deep learning algorithms generalize so well has attracted
increasing research interest. However, most of the well-established approaches,
such as hypothesis capacity, stability or sparseness, have not provided
complete explanations (Zhang et al., 2016; Kawaguchi et al., 2017). In this
work, we focus on the robustness approach (Xu & Mannor, 2012), i.e., if the
error of a hypothesis will not change much due to perturbations of its training
examples, then it will also generalize well. As most deep learning algorithms
are stochastic (e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent, Dropout, and
Bayes-by-backprop), we revisit the robustness arguments of Xu & Mannor, and
introduce a new approach, ensemble robustness, that concerns the robustness of
a population of hypotheses. Through the lens of ensemble robustness, we reveal
that a stochastic learning algorithm can generalize well as long as its
sensitiveness to adversarial perturbations is bounded in average over training
examples. Moreover, an algorithm may be sensitive to some adversarial examples
(Goodfellow et al., 2015) but still generalize well. To support our claims, we
provide extensive simulations for different deep learning algorithms and
different network architectures exhibiting a strong correlation between
ensemble robustness and the ability to generalize.

fields of theoretical computer science and information theory. In this work,
the focus is on coming up with lower bounds on this. The information cost of a
protocol is the amount of information the protocol reveals to Alice and Bob
about each others inputs, and the information complexity of a function is the
infimum of information costs over all valid protocols. For the amortized case,
it is known that the optimal rate for the computation is equal to the
information complexity. Exactly computing this information complexity is not
straight forward however. In this work we lower bound information complexity
for independent inputs in terms of the Wyner common information of a certain
pair of random variables. We show a structural property for the optimal
auxiliary random variable of Wyner common information and exploit this to
exactly compute the Wyner common information in certain cases. The lower bound
obtained through this technique is shown to be tight for a non-trivial example
- equality (EQ) for the ternary alphabet. We also give an example to show that
the lower bound may, in general, not be tight.

astronomical contexts and may have severe consequences for determining number
counts and luminosity functions, but also for optimising the use of telescope
time in follow-up observations. Because of its optimal properties, one of the
most popular and widely-used detection technique is the matched filter (MF).
This is a linear filter designed to maximise the detectability of a signal of
known structure that is buried in additive Gaussian random noise. In this work
we show that in the very common situation where the number and position of the
searched signals within a data sequence (e.g. an emission line in a spectrum)
or an image (e.g. a point-source in an interferometric map) are unknown, this
technique, when applied in its standard form, may severely underestimate the
probability of false detection. This is because the correct use of the MF
relies upon a-priori knowledge of the position of the signal of interest. In
the absence of this information, the statistical significance of features that
are actually noise is overestimated and detections claimed that are actually
spurious. For this reason, we present an alternative method of computing the
probability of false detection that is based on the probability density
function (PDF) of the peaks of a random field. It is able to provide a correct
estimate of the probability of false detection for the one-, two- and
three-dimensional case. We apply this technique to a real two-dimensional
interferometric map obtained with ALMA.

exotic arena for testing general relativity is in systems that contain one or
more black holes. Black holes are the most compact objects in the universe,
providing probes of the strongest-possible gravitational fields. We are
motivated to study strong-field gravity since many theories give large
deviations from general relativity only at large field strengths, while
recovering the weak-field behavior. In this article, we review how one can
probe general relativity and various alternative theories of gravity by using
electromagnetic waves from a black hole with an accretion disk, and
gravitational waves from black hole binaries. We first review model-independent
ways of testing gravity with electromagnetic/gravitational waves from a black
hole system. We then focus on selected examples of theories that extend general
relativity in rather simple ways. Some important characteristics of general
relativity include (but are not limited to) (i) only tensor gravitational
degrees of freedom, (ii) the graviton is massless, (iii) no quadratic or higher
curvatures in the action, and (iv) the theory is 4 dimensional. Altering a
characteristic leads to a different extension of general relativity: (i)
scalar-tensor theories, (ii) massive gravity theories, (iii) quadratic gravity,
and (iv) theories with large extra dimensions. Within each theory, we describe
black hole solutions, their properties, and current and projected constraints
on each theory using black hole-based tests of gravity. We close this review by
listing some of the open problems in model-independent tests and within each
specific theory.

increases, the drift of the Fermi distribution in reciprocal space produces
population inversion and gain for the LO phonons. Once this gain reaches a
threshold value, the avalanche-like increase of LO emission causes a rapid loss
of electron energy and momentum and leads to drift velocity saturation. Our
simple model correctly predicts both the general trend of the saturation
velocity decreasing with increasing electron density and the values of
saturation velocity measured in our experiments.

Kaluza$-$Klein theory for the source and torsion-free limits. The explicit
forms of the field equations containing a new spin current term and the
energy-momentum tensors in the usual four dimensions are obtained through the
well-known dimensional reduction procedure. In this limit, these field
equations admit (anti-)dyon and magnetic (anti-)monopole solutions as well as
non-Einsteinian solutions in the presence of a generalized Wu$-$Yang ansatz and
some specific warping functions when the extra dimensions associated with the
round and squashed three-sphere $S^{3}$ are, respectively, included. The
(anti-)dyonic solution has similar properties to those of the
Reissner$-$Nordstr\""{o}m$-$de Sitter black holes of the Einstein$-$Yang$-$Mills
system. However, the cosmological constant naturally appears in this approach,
and it associates with the constant warping function as well as the
three-sphere radius. It is demonstrated that not only the squashing parameter
$\ell$ behaves as the constant charge but also its sign can determine whether
the solution is a dyon/monopole or an antidyon/antimonopole. It is also shown
by using the power series method that the existence of nonconstant warping
function is essential for finding new exact Schwarzschild-like solutions in the

is widely applied to the study of the properties of $s$-wave single-orbital

poles that do not contribute to the absorptive part of the physical scattering

observable states of the theory making use of the Lee-Wick and Cutkoski,
Landshoff, Olive and Polkinghorne prescription for the construction of a
unitary S-matrix. Therefore, the spectrum consists on the graviton and short
lived elementary unstable particles that we named ""anti-gravitons"" because of
their repulsive contribution to the gravitational potential at short distance.
However, another interpretation of the complex conjugate pairs is proposed
based on the Calmet's suggestion, i.e. they could be understood as black hole
precursors long established in the classical theory. Since the theory is CPT
invariant, the complex conjugate of the micro black hole precursor has received
as a white hole precursor consistently with the t'Hooft complementary
principle. It is proved that the quantum theory is super-renormalizable in even
dimension, i.e. only a finite number of divergent diagrams survive, and finite
in odd dimension. Furthermore, turning on a local potential of the Riemann
tensor we can make the theory finite in any dimension. The singularity-free
Newtonian gravitational potential is explicitly computed for a range of higher
derivative theories. Finally, we propose a new super-reneromalizable or finite
Lee-Wick standard model of particle physics.

behaviour, in which the unbinding rate of a single dynein decreases with
increasing force, for a certain range of force. Motivated by these experiments,
we propose a model for catch bonding in dynein using a threshold force bond
deformation (TFBD) model wherein catch bonding sets in beyond a critical
applied load force. We study the effect of catch bonding on unidirectional
transport properties of cellular cargo carried by multiple dynein motors within
the framework of this model. We find catch bonding can result in dramatic
changes in the transport properties, which are in sharp contrast to kinesin
driven unidirectional transport, where catch bonding is absent. We predict
that, under certain conditions, the average velocity of the cellular cargo can
actually increase as applied load is increased. We characterize the transport
properties in terms of a velocity profile phase plot in the parameter space of
the catch bond strength and the stall force of the motor. This phase plot
yields predictions that may be experimentally accessed by suitable
modifications of motor transport and binding properties. Our work necessitates
a reexamination of existing theories of collective bidirectional transport of
cellular cargo where the catch bond effect of dynein described in this paper is
expected to play a crucial role.

studying brain activity. Modeling spatial dependence of imaging data at
different scales is one of the main challenges of contemporary neuroimaging,
and it could allow for accurate testing for significance in neural activity.
The high dimensionality of this type of data (on the order of hundreds of
thousands of voxels) poses serious modeling challenges and considerable
computational constraints. For the sake of feasibility, standard models
typically reduce dimensionality by modeling covariance among regions of
interest (ROIs) -- coarser or larger spatial units -- rather than among voxels.
However, ignoring spatial dependence at different scales could drastically
reduce our ability to detect activation patterns in the brain and hence produce
misleading results. To overcome these problems, we introduce a multi-resolution
spatio-temporal model and a computationally efficient methodology to estimate
cognitive control related activation and whole-brain connectivity. The proposed
model allows for testing voxel-specific activation while accounting for
non-stationary local spatial dependence within anatomically defined ROIs, as
well as regional dependence (between-ROIs). Furthermore, the model allows for
detection of interpretable connectivity patterns among ROIs using the graphical
Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator (LASSO). The model is used in a
motor-task fMRI study to investigate brain activation and connectivity patterns
aimed at identifying associations between these patterns and regaining motor
functionality following a stroke.

information about their characteristics. We consider the settings where the
parties engaged are extremely patient and are interested in long-term
partnerships. Hence, once the final matches are determined, they persist for a
long time. Each side has an opportunity to learn (some) relevant information
about the other before final matches are made. For instance, clients seeking
workers to perform tasks often conduct interviews that require the workers to
perform some tasks and thereby provide information to both sides. The
performance of a worker in such an interview- and hence the information
revealed - depends both on the inherent characteristics of the worker and the
task and also on the actions taken by the worker (e.g. the effort expended),
which are not observed by the client. Thus there is moral hazard. Our goal is
to derive a dynamic matching mechanism that facilitates learning on both sides
before final matches are achieved and ensures that the worker side does not
have incentive to obscure learning of their characteristics through their
actions. We derive such a mechanism that leads to final matching that achieve
optimal performance (revenue) in equilibrium. We show that the equilibrium
strategy is long-run coalitionally stable, which means there is no subset of
workers and clients that can gain by deviating from the equilibrium strategy.

Advanced LIGO, has the potential to revolutionize observational astrophysics.
But to fully utilize this new window into the universe, we must compare these
new observations to detailed models of binary black hole formation throughout
cosmic time. Expanding upon our previous work (Rodriguez et al., 2015), we
study merging binary black holes formed in globular clusters using our Monte
Carlo approach to stellar dynamics. We have created a new set of 52 cluster
models with different masses, metallicities, and radii to fully characterize
the binary black hole merger rate. These models include all the relevant
dynamical processes (such as two-body relaxation, strong encounters, and
three-body binary formation) and agree well with detailed direct N-body
simulations. In addition, we have enhanced our stellar evolution algorithms
with updated metallicity-dependent stellar wind and supernova prescriptions,
allowing us to compare our results directly to the most recent population
synthesis predictions for merger rates from isolated binary evolution. We
explore the relationship between a cluster's global properties and the
population of binary black holes that it produces. In particular, we derive a
numerically calibrated relationship between the merger times of ejected black
hole binaries and a cluster's mass and radius. We explore the masses and mass
ratios of these binaries as a function of redshift, and find a merger rate of
~5 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ in the local universe, with 80% of sources having total
masses from $32M_{\odot}$ to $64M_{\odot}$. Under standard assumptions,
approximately 1 out of every 7 binary black hole mergers in the local universe
will have originated in a globular cluster, but we also explore the sensitivity
of this result to different assumptions for binary stellar evolution.

  Baumslag-Solitar Groups",,,,,"cs.CC cs.DM math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Baumslag-Solitar groups were introduced in 1962 by Baumslag and Solitar as
examples for finitely presented non-Hopfian two-generator groups. Since then,
they served as examples for a wide range of purposes. As Baumslag-Solitar
groups are HNN extensions, there is a natural generalization in terms of graph
of groups.
  Concerning algorithmic aspects of generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups,
several decidability results are known. Indeed, a straightforward application
of standard algorithms leads to a polynomial time solution of the word problem
(the question whether some word over the generators represents the identity of
the group). The conjugacy problem (the question whether two given words
represent conjugate group elements) is more complicated; still decidability has
been established by Anshel and Stebe for ordinary Baumslag-Solitar groups and
for generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups independently by Lockhart and Beeker.
However, up to now no precise complexity estimates have been given.
  In this work, we give a LOGSPACE algorithm for both problems. More precisely,
we describe a uniform TC^0 many-one reduction of the word problem to the word
problem of the free group. Then we refine the known techniques for the
conjugacy problem and show that it can be solved in LOGSPACE. Moreover, for
ordinary Baumslag-Solitar groups also conjugacy is AC^0-Turing-reducible to the
word problem of the free group.
  Finally, we consider uniform versions (where also the graph of groups is part
of the input) of both word and conjugacy problem: while the word problem still
is solvable in LOGSPACE, the conjugacy problem becomes EXPSPACE-complete.

theorems against the hidden-variable theories showing that certain quantum
features cannot be reproduced based on two rationale premises of classicality,
the Bell theorem, and noncontextuality, due to Bell, Kochen and Specker (BKS) .
Tests of the Bell inequality and the BKS theorem are both of fundamental
interests and of great significance . The Bell theorem has already been
experimentally verified extensively on many different systems , while the
quantum contextuality, which is independent of nonlocality and manifests itself
even in a single object, is experimentally more demanding. Moreover, the
contextuality has been shown to play a critical role to supply the `magic' for
quantum computation, making more extensive experimental verifications in
potential systems for quantum computing even more stringent. Here we report an
experimental verification of quantum contextuality on an individual atomic
nuclear spin-1 system in solids under ambient condition. Such a three-level
system is indivisible and thus the compatibility loophole, which exists in the
experiments performed on bipartite systems, is closed. Our experimental results
confirm that the quantum contextuality cannot be explained by nonlocal
entanglement, revealing the fundamental quantumness other than
locality/nonlocality within the intrinsic spin freedom of a concrete natural

that the reversals of solar polar magnetic fields exhibit elements of a
stochastic process, which may include the development of specific patterns of
emerging magnetic flux, and the asymmetry in activity between northern and
southern hemispheres. The presence of such irregularities makes the modeling
and prediction of polar field reversals extremely hard if possible. In a
classical model of solar activity cycle, the unipolar magnetic regions (UMRs)
of predominantly following polarity fields are transported polewards due to
meridional flows and diffusion. The UMRs gradually cancel out the polar
magnetic field of the previous cycle, and re-build the polar field of opposite
polarity setting the stage for the next cycle. We show, however, that this
deterministic picture can be easily altered by the developing of a strong
center of activity, or by the emergence of an extremely large active region, or
by a ""strategically placed"" coronal hole. We demonstrate that the activity
occurring during the current cycle 24 may be the result of this randomness in
the evolution of the solar surface magnetic field.

arising for instance in models with a hidden unbroken Abelian sector, so that
dark matter couples to a massless dark photon. The dark sector interacts with
ordinary matter via gravity and photon-dark photon kinetic mixing. Mirror dark
matter is a theoretically constrained special case where all parameters are
fixed except for the kinetic mixing strength, $\epsilon$. In these models, the
dark matter halo around spiral and irregular galaxies takes the form of a
dissipative plasma which evolves in response to various heating and cooling
processes. It has been argued previously that such dynamics can account for the
inferred cored density profiles of galaxies and other related structural
features. Here we focus on the apparent deficit of nearby small galaxies
(""missing satellite problem""), which these dissipative models have the
potential to address through small-scale power suppression by acoustic and
diffusion damping. Using a variant of the extended Press-Schechter formalism,
we evaluate the halo mass function for the special case of mirror dark matter.
Considering a simplified model where $M_{\text{baryons}} \propto
M_{\text{halo}}$, we relate the halo mass function to more directly observable
quantities, and find that for $\epsilon/10^{-10} \approx 2$ such a simplified
description is compatible with the measured galaxy luminosity and velocity
functions. On scales $M_{\text{halo}} \lesssim 10^8 \ M_\odot$, diffusion
damping exponentially suppresses the halo mass function, suggesting a
nonprimordial origin for dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies, which we
speculate were formed via a top-down fragmentation process as the result of
nonlinear dissipative collapse of larger density perturbation. This could
explain the planar orientation of satellite galaxies around Andromeda and the
Milky Way.

progress has been achieved in both measurements and modeling of the cosmogenic
proxy, uncertainties still remain in the determination of the geomagnetic
dipole moment evolution. Here we improve the reconstruction of solar activity
over the past nine millennia using a multi-proxy approach. We used records of
the 14C and 10Be cosmogenic isotopes, current numerical models of the isotope
production and transport in Earth's atmosphere, and available geomagnetic field
reconstructions, including a new reconstruction relying on an updated
archeo-/paleointensity database. The obtained series were analyzed using the
singular spectrum analysis (SSA) method to study the millennial-scale trends. A
new reconstruction of the geomagnetic dipole field moment, GMAG.9k, is built
for the last nine millennia. New reconstructions of solar activity covering the
last nine millennia, quantified in sunspot numbers, are presented and analyzed.
A conservative list of grand minima and maxima is provided. The primary
components of the reconstructed solar activity, as determined using the SSA
method, are different for the series based on 14C and 10Be. These primary
components can only be ascribed to long-term changes in the terrestrial system
and not to the Sun. They have been removed from the reconstructed series. In
contrast, the secondary SSA components of the reconstructed solar activity are
found to be dominated by a common ~2400-yr quasi-periodicity, the so-called
Hallstatt cycle, in both the 14C and 10Be based series. This Hallstatt cycle
thus appears to be related to solar activity. Finally, we show that the grand
minima and maxima occurred intermittently over the studied period, with
clustering near highs and lows of the Hallstatt cycle, respectively.

fluctuation-limited imprecision at the standard quantum limit. By engineering

abdominal aortic aneurysm and exact simulation of the bifurcated stent graft,
physicians are supported in choosing a suitable stent prior to an intervention.
The presented method can be used to measure the dimensions of the abdominal
aortic aneurysm as well as simulate a bifurcated stent graft. Both of these
procedures are based on a preceding segmentation and skeletonization of the
aortic, right and left iliac. Using these centerlines (aortic, right and left
iliac) a bifurcated initial stent is constructed. Through the implementation of
an ACM method the initial stent is fit iteratively to the vessel walls - due to
the influence of external forces (distance- as well as balloonforce). Following
the fitting process, the crucial values for choosing a bifurcated stent graft
are measured, e.g. aortic diameter, right and left common iliac diameter,
minimum diameter of distal neck. The selected stent is then simulated to the
CT-Data - starting with the initial stent. It hereby becomes apparent if the
dimensions of the bifurcated stent graft are exact, i.e. the fitting to the
arteries was done properly and no ostium was covered.

(including dose and quality parameters) on most of these traditional medicines
are far from sufficient to meet the criteria needed to support their world-wide

their wider application and acceptance. Metabolomics -a novel approach to
reveal altered metabolism (biochemical effects) produced in response to a
disease or its therapeutic intervention- has huge potential to assess the
pharmacology and toxicology of traditional herbal medicines (THMs). Therefore,
it is gradually becoming a mutually complementary technique to genomics,
transcriptomics and proteomics for therapeutic evaluation of pharmaceutical
products (including THMs); the approach is so called pharmaco-metabolomics. The
whole paradigm is based on its ability to provide metabolic signatures to
confirm the diseased condition and then to use the concentration profiles of
these biomarkers to assess the therapeutic response. Nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy coupled with multivariate data analysis is currently the
method of choice for pharmaco-metabolomics studies owing to its unbiased,
non-destructive nature and minimal sample preparation requirement. In recent

prove the therapeutic efficacy/safety and to explore the underlying mechanisms
of THMs, with promising results. The current perspective article summarizes

to, a sensible transmission range, limited buffer space for the storage of
messages, representative data traffic models, and realistic movements of the
mobile users and several mobility models that represent mobile nodes whose
movements are dependent on each other (i.e., group mobility models ).The goal
of this paper is to simulate the movements of mobile nodes within a network and
present a number of mobility models in order to demonstrate its effect on
Location management scheme for mobile ad hoc network or personal communication
services networks. Specifically, to illustrate how the performance results of
an ad hoc network protocol drastically change as a result of changing the
mobility model simulated. Location management is a fundamental problem in
personal communication services network. The current standard of location
management is HLR/VLR scheme. It has been observed that the performance of any
location management scheme depends on space requirements, bandwidth
requirements and time requirements. To avoid certain drawbacks in HLR/VLR
scheme, many approaches including hierarchical approaches have been suggested.
Working set idea is chosen to analyze its performance for location management
in PCS networks. Due to inadequacy of standard network simulators to provide
the output in the format desired, a new location management simulator can be
built. Two variants of working set idea viz. Working set scheme for HLR/VLR
approach and working set scheme for hierarchical approach can be used and then
compare the performance of HLR/VLR scheme and working set scheme using the
results obtained by the simulator with respect to already available mobile
activity traces.

quantum gases because it provides information about the quantum many-body wave
function beyond the simple density profile. In this paper we first study the
$M$-body local correlation functions, $g_M$, of the one-dimensional (1D)
strongly repulsive Bose gas within the Lieb-Liniger model using the analytical
method proposed by Gangardt and Shlyapnikov [1,2]. In the strong repulsion
regime the 1D Bose gas at low temperatures is equivalent to a gas of ideal
particles obeying the non-mutual generalized exclusion statistics (GES) with a
statistical parameter $\alpha =1-2/\gamma$, i.e. the quasimomenta of $N$
strongly interacting bosons map to the momenta of $N$ free fermions via
$k_i\approx \alpha k_i^F $ with $i=1,\ldots, N$. Here $\gamma$ is the
dimensionless interaction strength within the Lieb-Liniger model. We rigorously
prove that such a statistical parameter $\alpha$ solely determines the
sub-leading order contribution to the $M$-body local correlation function of
the gas at strong but finite interaction strengths. We explicitly calculate the
correlation functions $g_M$ in terms of $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ at zero, low, and
intermediate temperatures. For $M=2$ and $3$ our results reproduce the known
expressions for $g_{2}$ and $g_{3}$ with sub-leading terms (see for instance
[3-5]). We also express the leading order of the short distance
\emph{non-local} correlation functions
$\langle\Psi^\dagger(x_1)\cdots\Psi^\dagger(x_M)\Psi(y_M)\cdots\Psi(y_1)\rangle$
of the strongly repulsive Bose gas in terms of the wave function of $M$ bosons
at zero collision energy and zero total momentum. Here $\Psi(x)$ is the boson
annihilation operator. These general formulas of the higher-order local and
non-local correlation functions of the 1D Bose gas provide new insights into
the many-body physics.

emission of both hubs consists of a single peaked clump elongated in the
direction of the associated filament. At small scales, the SMA images reveal
that both hubs fragment into several dust condensations. The fragmentation
level was assessed under the same conditions and we found that hub-N presents 4
fragments while hub-S is more fragmented, with 13 fragments identified. We
studied the density structure by means of a simultaneous fit of the radial
intensity profile at 870 and 350 microns and the spectral energy distribution
adopting a Plummer-like function to describe the density structure. The
parameters inferred from the model are remarkably similar in both hubs,
suggesting that density structure could not be responsible in determining the
fragmentation level. We estimated several physical parameters such as the level
of turbulence and the magnetic field strength, and we found no significant
differences between these hubs. The Jeans analysis indicates that the observed
fragmentation is more consistent with thermal Jeans fragmentation compared with
a scenario that turbulent support is included. The lower fragmentation level
observed in hub-N could be explained in terms of stronger UV radiation effects
from a nearby HII region, evolutionary effects, and/or stronger magnetic fields
at small scales, a scenario that should be further investigated.

via a large spin composed of N identical two level systems. One coupling
implements the dissipative Dicke super- radiance. The other coupling is locally
of the pure-dephasing type and requires to go beyond the standard weak-coupling
limit by employing a Bogoliubov mapping in the corresponding reservoir. After
the mapping, the large spin is coupled to a collective mode with the original
pure-dephasing interaction, but the collective mode is dissipatively coupled to
the residual oscillators. Treating the large spin and the collective mode as
the system, a standard master equation approach is now able to capture the
energy transfer between the two reservoirs. Assuming fast relaxation of the
collective mode, we derive a coarse-grained rate equation for the large spin
only and discuss how the original Dicke superradiance is affected by the
presence of the additional reservoir. Our main finding is a cooperatively
enhanced rectification effect due to the interplay of supertransmittant heat
currents (scaling quadratically with $N$) and the asymmetric coupling to both
reservoirs. For large $N$, the system can thus significantly amplify current
asymmetries under bias reversal, functioning as a heat diode. We also briefly
discuss the case when the couplings of the collective spin are locally
dissipative, showing that the heat-diode effect is still present.

cluster age of (4.0 +- 0.8) Myr is found through isochrone fitting, and a total
mass of (1.6 +- 0.6) x 10^4 Msol is estimated thanks to our extensive knowledge

ultracold ${}^{173}$Yb atoms in the recent paper [Nature Physics 10, 198

with a repulsive interaction acquires spin-charge separated conformal field
theories of an effective Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and an antiferromagnetic
$SU(w)$ Heisenberg spin chain. Here we analytically derive universal
thermodynamics of 1D strongly repulsive fermionic gases with $SU(w)$ symmetry
via the Yang-Yang thermodynamic Bethe ansatz method. The analytical free energy
and magnetic properties of the systems at low temperatures in a weak magnetic
field are obtained through the Wiener-Hopf method. In particular, the free
energy essentially manifests the spin-charge separated conformal field theories
for the high symmetry systems with arbitrary repulsive interaction strength. We
also find that the sound velocity of the Fermi gases in the large $w$ limit
coincides with that for the spinless Bose gas, whereas the spin velocity
vanishes quickly as $w$ becomes large. This indicates a strong suppression of
the Fermi exclusion statistics by the commutativity feature among the
$w$-component fermions with different spin states in the Tomonaga-Luttinger
liquid phase. Moreover, the equations of state and critical behaviour of
physical quantities at finite temperatures are analytically derived in terms of
the polylogarithm functions in the quantum critical region.

studying how children perceive objects in early stages of development. From the
computer vision perspective, object segmentation in such videos pose quite a
few challenges because the child's view is unfocused, often with large head
movements, effecting in sudden changes in the child's point of view which leads
to frequent change in object properties such as size, shape and illumination.
In this paper, we develop a semi-automated, domain specific, method to address
these concerns and facilitate the object annotation process for cognitive
scientists allowing them to select and monitor the object under segmentation.
The method starts with an annotation from the user of the desired object and
employs graph cut segmentation and optical flow computation to predict the
object mask for subsequent video frames automatically. To maintain accuracy, we
use domain specific heuristic rules to re-initialize the program with new user
input whenever object properties change dramatically. The evaluations
demonstrate the high speed and accuracy of the presented method for object
segmentation in voluminous egocentric videos. We apply the proposed method to
investigate potential patterns in object distribution in child's view at
progressive ages.

The
basic mechanism to drive such a transmission, known as clocking, can be

experiments on Ta/CoFeB/MgO multilayers [D. Bhowmik, et al., Nat. Nano. 9, 59

clocking by using a full micromagnetic framework and considering two different

comparison of the numerical results with the experiments while the latter
permits to predict the effect of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in
the clocking mechanism. Results show that the clocking state is non-uniform and
it is characterized by the presence of domains separated by Bloch (N\'eel)
domain walls depending on the absence (presence) of the DMI. Our findings point
out that for the design of nanomagnetic logic a full micromagnetic approach is

has recently improved. Conversely, the understanding of their time evolution is
more complex, since it requires analysis of stellar populations with different
ages, or systematic studies of galaxies at different redshifts. In the Local
Universe, Hii regions and planetary nebulae (PNe) are important tools to
investigate it. We present an in-depth study of all nearby spiral galaxies
(M33, M31, NGC300, and M81) with direct-method nebular abundances of both
populations. For the first time, we also evaluate the radial migration of PN
populations. We analyse Hii region and PN properties to: determine whether
oxygen in PNe is a reliable tracer for past interstellar medium (ISM)
composition; homogenise the published datasets; estimate the migration of the
oldest stellar populations; determine the overall chemical enrichment and slope
evolution. We confirm that oxygen in PNe is a reliable tracer for the past ISM
metallicity. We find that PN gradients are flatter than or equal to those of
Hii regions. When radial motions are negligible, this result provides a direct
measurement of the time evolution of the gradient. For galaxies with dominant
radial motions, we provide upper limits on the gradient evolution. Finally, the
total metal content increases with time in all target galaxies, with early
morphological type having a larger increment Delta(O/H) than late-type
galaxies. Our findings provide important constraints to discriminate among
different galactic evolutionary scenarios, favouring cosmological models with
enhanced feedback from supernovae. The advent of extremely large telescopes
will allow us to include galaxies in a wider range of morphologies and
environments, thus putting firmer constraints to galaxy formation and evolution
scenarios.

6240 and M51 made with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Two major H2O maser
features and several minor features are detected toward the southern nucleus of
NGC 6240. These features are redshifted by about 300 km/s from the galaxy's
systemic velocity and remain unresolved at the synthesized beam size. A
combination of our two-epoch observations and published data reveals an
apparent correlation between the strength of the maser and the 22GHz radio
continuum emission, implying that the maser excitation relates to the activity
of an active galactic nucleus in the southern nucleus rather than star-forming
activity. The star-forming galaxy M51 hosts H2O maser emission in the center of
the galaxy; however, the origin of the maser has been an open question. We
report the first detection of 22GHz nuclear radio continuum emission in M51.
The continuum emission is co-located with the maser position, which indicates
that the maser arises from active galactic nucleus-activity and not from
star-forming activity in the galaxy.

The reproduction of the observed colour magnitude features is very satisfying

age is required to fit the colour-magnitude diagram. Indeed we can use coeval
isochrones for the synthetic populations, and we estimate that the ages fall
within a $\sim 0.5$ Gyr time interval; in particular the most metal rich
population can be coeval (in the above meaning) with the others, if its stars
are very helium--rich (Y$\sim$0.37) and with the observed CNO enhancement
([(C+N+O)/Fe] = + 0.7); 2) a satisfactory fit of the whole HB is obtained,
consistent with the choice of the populations providing a good reproduction of
the main sequence and sub giant data. 3) the split in magnitude observed in the
red HB is well reproduced assuming the presence of two stellar populations in
the two different sequences observed: a metal poor population made of stars
evolving from the blue side (luminous branch) and a metal richer one whose
stars are in a stage closer to the zero age HB (dimmer branch). This
modelization also fits satisfactorily the period and the [Fe/H] distribution of

Cauchy-Green deformation tensor. In isotropic one- and two-dimensional
situations the elastic energy can be expressed equivalently through the right
deformation tensor. The predicted isotropic low temperature non-linear elastic
effects are directly related to the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state with bulk
modulus derivative $K'=4$ for bcc. A two-dimensional generalization suggests
$K'_{2D}=5$. These predictions are in agreement with ab initio results for

non-linearity arises if the strain dependence of the density wave amplitudes is

and to find appropriate starting values. R package mgcv implements a wide range
of smoothers, all in a manner appropriate for inclusion in JAGS code, and
automates centring and other smooth setup tasks. The purpose of this note is to
describe an interface between mgcv and JAGS, based around an R function,

about the model via Gibbs sampling. Although the auto-generated JAGS code can

to add complex stochastic model components readily specified in JAGS. A simple

described here will be un-necessarily inefficient if all that is required is
fully Bayesian inference about a standard GAM, rather than the full flexibility

different from 3D. In 2D, the simultaneous conservation of both energy and
enstrophy in the inertial ranges of scales leads to a forward cascade of
enstrophy and a reverse cascade of energy. In 3D, helicity, the integral of the
scalar product of velocity and vorticity, is also an inviscid flow invariant
along with kinetic energy. Unlike enstrophy, however, helicity does not block
the cascade of energy to small scales. Energy and helicity are not only
globally conserved but also conserved within each non-linear triadic
interaction between three plane waves in the spectral form of the
Navier--Stokes equation (NSE). By decomposing each plane wave into two helical
modes of opposite helicities each triadic interaction is split into a set of
eight triadic interactions between helical modes (Waleffe 1992). Biferale et
al. (2012) recently found that a subset of these interactions which render both
signs of helicity separately conserved (i.e. enstrophy-like) leads to an
inverse cascade of (part of) the energy. Motivated by this finding we introduce

criterion to distinguish when two surfaces will stick together or not, and
suggested it shows a large conflict with asperity theories. It is found that
their criterion corresponds very closely to the Fuller and Tabor asperity model
one when bandwidth {\alpha} is small, but otherwise involves a rms ampliture of
roughness reduced by a factor Sqrt({\alpha}). Therefore, it implies the
stickiness of any rough surface is the same as that of the surface where
practically all wavelength components of roughness are removed except the very
fine ones, which is perhaps counterintuitive. The results are therefore very
interesting, if confirmed. Possible sources of approximations are indicated,
and a significant error is found in plotting the pull-off data which may
improve the fit with Fuller and Tabor. However, still they show finite pull-off
values in cases where both their own criterion and an asperity based one seem
to suggest non stickiness, and the results are in these respects inconclusive.

we show that plant coexistence typically requires both weak competition between
plants for resources (e.g., space or nutrients) and pollinator preferences that
are not too biased in favour of either plant. We also show how plant
coexistence is promoted by indirect facilitation via the pollinator. When
pollinators are adaptive foragers, pollinator's diet maximizes pollinator's
fitness measured as the per capita population growth rate. Simulations show
that this has two conflicting consequences for plant coexistence. On the one
hand, when competition between pollinators is weak, adaptation favours
pollinator specialization on the more profitable plant which increases
asymmetries in plant competition and makes their coexistence less likely. On
the other hand, when competition between pollinators is strong, adaptation
promotes generalism, which facilitates plant coexistence. In addition, adaptive
foraging allows pollinators to survive sudden loss of the preferred plant host,
thus preventing further collapse of the entire community.

and then fit using distributed algorithms. The dataset can be partitioned
either horizontally (in the sample space) or vertically (in the feature space).
While the majority of the literature focuses on sample space partitioning,
feature space partitioning is more effective when $p\gg n$. Existing methods
for partitioning features, however, are either vulnerable to high correlations
or inefficient in reducing the model dimension. In this paper, we solve these
problems through a new embarrassingly parallel framework named DECO for
distributed variable selection and parameter estimation. In DECO, variables are
first partitioned and allocated to $m$ distributed workers. The decorrelated
subset data within each worker are then fitted via any algorithm designed for
high-dimensional problems. We show that by incorporating the decorrelation
step, DECO can achieve consistent variable selection and parameter estimation
on each subset with (almost) no assumptions. In addition, the convergence rate
is nearly minimax optimal for both sparse and weakly sparse models and does NOT
depend on the partition number $m$. Extensive numerical experiments are
provided to illustrate the performance of the new framework.

Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy
measurements observe a gap opening at the Fermi surface below $\approx$ 60 K.
Elucidating the microscopic properties and understanding the pairing mechanism
of single-layer FeSe is of utmost importance as it is a basic building block of
iron-based superconductors. Here, we use the low-energy muon spin
rotation/relaxation technique (LE-$\mu$SR) to detect and quantify the
supercarrier density and determine the gap symmetry in FeSe grown on SrTiO$_3$
(100). Measurements in applied field show a temperature dependent broadening of
the field distribution below $\sim$ 60 K, reflecting the superconducting
transition and formation of a vortex state. Zero field measurements rule out
the presence of magnetism of static or fluctuating origin. From the
inhomogeneous field distribution, we determine an effective sheet supercarrier
density $n_s^{2D} \simeq 6 \times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ at $T \rightarrow 0$ K,
which is a factor of 4 larger than expected from ARPES measurements of the
excess electron count per Fe of 1 monolayer (ML) FeSe. The temperature
dependence of the superfluid density $n_s(T)$ can be well described down to
$\sim$ 10 K by simple s-wave BCS, indicating a rather clean superconducting
phase with a gap of 10.2(1.1) meV. The result is a clear indication of the
gradual formation of a two dimensional vortex lattice existing over the entire

superconductivity below 60 K in ultrathin FeSe.

account for host properties which we then marginalize over when determining
cosmological parameters. We see a shift towards more negative values of the

temperature gradient and the height above the bottom, is investigated in an
oceanographic context, using high-resolution temperature measurements. The
model for the evolution of a stratified layer by Balmforth et al. (1998) is
reviewed and adapted to the case of a turbulent flow above a wall. Model
predictions are compared to the average observational estimates of the flux,
exploiting a flux estimation method proposed by Winters & D'Asaro (1996). This
estimation method enables the disentanglement of the dependence of the average
flux on the height above the bottom and on the background temperature gradient.
The classical N-shaped flux-gradient relation is found in the observations.
Model and observations show similar qualitative behaviour, despite the strong
simplifications used in the model. The results shed light on the modulation of
the temperature flux by the presence of the boundary, and support the idea of a
turbulent flux following a mixing-length argument in a stratified flow.
Furthermore, the results support the use of Thorpe scales close to a boundary,
if sufficient averaging is performed, suggesting that the Thorpe scales are

dimension of the level sets of a generic real-valued continuous function (in
the sense of Baire category) defined on a compact metric space $K$. Later on,
the author extended the theory for maps from $K$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$. The main
goal of this paper is to generalize the relevant results for topological and
packing dimensions.
  Let $K$ be a compact metric space and let us denote by $C(K,\mathbb{R}^n)$
the set of continuous maps from $K$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$ endowed with the maximum
norm. Let $\dim_{*}$ be one of the topological dimension $\dim_T$, the
Hausdorff dimension $\dim_H$, or the packing dimension $\dim_P$. Define
$$d_{*}^n(K)=\inf\{\dim_{*}(K\setminus F): F\subset K \textrm{ is
$\sigma$-compact with } \dim_T F<n\}.$$ We prove that $d^n_{*}(K)$ is the right
notion to describe the dimensions of the fibers of a generic continuous map
$f\in C(K,\mathbb{R}^n)$. In particular, we show that $\sup\{\dim_{*}f^{-1}(y):
y\in \mathbb{R}^n\} =d^n_{*}(K)$ provided that $\dim_T K\geq n$, otherwise
every fiber is finite. Proving the above theorem for packing dimension requires
entirely new ideas. Moreover, we show that the supremum is attained on the left
hand side of the above equation.
  Assume $\dim_T K\geq n$. If $K$ is sufficiently homogeneous, then we can say
much more. For example, we prove that $\dim_{*}f^{-1}(y)=d^n_{*}(K)$ for a
generic $f\in C(K,\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all $y\in \textrm{int} f(K)$ if and only
if $d^n_{*}(U)=d^n_{*}(K)$ or $\dim_T U<n$ for all open sets $U\subset K$. This
is new even if $n=1$ and $\dim_{*}=\dim_H$. It is known that for a generic
$f\in C(K,\mathbb{R}^n)$ the interior of $f(K)$ is not empty. We augment the
above characterization by showing that $\dim_T \partial f(K)=\dim_H \partial
f(K)=n-1$ for a generic $f\in C(K,\mathbb{R}^n)$.

vertices x and y there is a vertex in the set which has distinct distances to x

size, the metric dimension of the graph. The problem of computing the metric
dimension of a graph is a well-known NP-hard problem and while it was known to
be polynomial time solvable on trees, it is only recently that efforts have
been made to understand its computational complexity on various restricted
graph classes. In recent work, Foucaud et al. (2015) showed that this problem
is NP-complete even on interval graphs. They complemented this result by also
showing that it is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) parameterized by the metric
dimension of the graph. In this work, we show that this FPT result can in fact
be extended to all graphs of bounded tree-length. This includes well-known
classes like chordal graphs, AT-free graphs and permutation graphs. We also
show that this problem is FPT parameterized by the modular-width of the input

physical-layer network coding (PLNC), signature codes and tree splitting. In
presence of a collision, physical-layer network coding enables the receiver to
decode, i.e. compute, the sum of the packets that were transmitted by the
individual users. For each user, the packet consists of the user's signature,
as well as the data that the user wants to communicate. As long as no more than
K users collide, their identities can be recovered from the sum of their
signatures. This framework for creating and transmitting packets can be used as
a fundamental building block in random access algorithms, since it helps to
deal efficiently with the uncertainty of the set of contending terminals. In
this paper we show how to apply the framework in conjunction with a
tree-splitting algorithm, which is required to deal with the case that more
than K users collide. We demonstrate that our approach achieves throughput that
tends to 1 rapidly as K increases. We also present results on net data-rate of
the system, showing the impact of the overheads of the constituent elements of
the proposed protocol. We compare the performance of our scheme with an upper
bound that is obtained under the assumption that the active users are a priori
known. Also, we consider an upper bound on the net data-rate for any PLNC based
strategy in which one linear equation per slot is decoded. We show that already
at modest packet lengths, the net data-rate of our scheme becomes close to the
second upper bound, i.e. the overhead of the contention resolution algorithm
and the signature codes vanishes.

crucial role in the class determination, or have only little influence (or
eventually none) on the classification results according to the context. We
propose a credal classification method for incomplete pattern with adaptive
imputation of missing values based on belief function theory. At first, we try
to classify the object (incomplete pattern) based only on the available
attribute values. As underlying principle, we assume that the missing
information is not crucial for the classification if a specific class for the
object can be found using only the available information. In this case, the
object is committed to this particular class. However, if the object cannot be
classified without ambiguity, it means that the missing values play a main role
for achieving an accurate classification. In this case, the missing values will
be imputed based on the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) and self-organizing map (SOM)
techniques, and the edited pattern with the imputation is then classified. The
(original or edited) pattern is respectively classified according to each
training class, and the classification results represented by basic belief
assignments are fused with proper combination rules for making the credal
classification. The object is allowed to belong with different masses of belief
to the specific classes and meta-classes (which are particular disjunctions of
several single classes). The credal classification captures well the
uncertainty and imprecision of classification, and reduces effectively the rate
of misclassifications thanks to the introduction of meta-classes. The
effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to other classical methods is
demonstrated based on several experiments using artificial and real data sets.

vacuum tension $\tau =(c^4/4G )$. Numerically, $\tau \approx 3.026\times
10^{43}$ Newton. In order of magnitude, this is the tension that has been
proposed for microscopic string models of gravity. However, after decades of
hard work on string theory models of gravity, there is no firm scientific
evidence that such models of gravity apply empirically. Our purpose is thereby
to discuss the gravitational tension in terms of the conventional Einstein
general theory of relativity that apparently does explain much and maybe all of
presently known experimental gravity data. The central result is that matter on
the horizon surface is bound by the entropy-area law by tension in the closely
analogous sense that the Wilson action-area law also describes a surface
confinement.

given model should be rejected based on a sample from the population. Sample
data may contain sensitive information about individuals, such as medical
information. Thus it is important to design statistical tests that guarantee
the privacy of subjects in the data. In this work, we study hypothesis testing
subject to differential privacy, specifically chi-squared tests for goodness of
fit for multinomial data and independence between two categorical variables.
  We propose new tests for goodness of fit and independence testing that like
the classical versions can be used to determine whether a given model should be
rejected or not, and that additionally can ensure differential privacy. We give
both Monte Carlo based hypothesis tests as well as hypothesis tests that more
closely follow the classical chi-squared goodness of fit test and the Pearson
chi-squared test for independence. Crucially, our tests account for the
distribution of the noise that is injected to ensure privacy in determining
significance.
  We show that these tests can be used to achieve desired significance levels,
in sharp contrast to direct applications of classical tests to differentially
private contingency tables which can result in wildly varying significance
levels. Moreover, we study the statistical power of these tests. We empirically
show that to achieve the same level of power as the classical non-private tests
our new tests need only a relatively modest increase in sample size.

superconducting stripline resonators.
  Here we study Sn thin films, deposited via thermal evaporation -ranging in
thickness between 38 nm and 842 nm- which encompasses the percolation
transition. We use superconducting Pb stripline resonators to probe the
microwave response of these Sn films in a frequency range between 4 GHz and 20
GHz at temperatures from 7.2 K down to 1.5 K. The measured quality factor of
the resonators decreases with rising temperature due to enhanced losses. As a
function of the sample thickness we observe three regimes with significantly
different properties: samples below percolation, i.e. ensembles of disconnected
superconducting islands, exhibit dielectric properties with negligible losses,
demonstrating that macroscopic current paths are required for appreciable
dynamical conductivity of Sn at GHz frequencies. Thick Sn films, as the other
limit, lead to low-loss resonances both above and below $T_c$ of Sn, as
expected for bulk conductors. But in an intermediate thickness regime, just
above percolation and with labyrinth-like morphology of the Sn, we observe a
quite different behavior: the superconducting state has a microwave response
similar to the thicker, completely covering films with low microwave losses;
but the metallic state of these Sn films is so lossy that resonator operation
is suppressed completely.

novel approach for external-field-free spin Hall switching of a perpendicular
nanomagnet by utilizing a local dipolar field arising from an adjacent in-plane
magnetic layer. Robust switching of perpendicular CoFeB nanopillars in a
dipole-coupled composite stack is experimentally demonstrated in the absence of
any external magnetic field, in consistent with the results of micromagnetic
simulation. Large in-plane compensation field of about 135 Oe and out-of-plane
loop shift of about 45 Oe / 10 7 A cm-2 are obtained in the nanopillar devices
with composite structure. By performing micromagnetic simulations, we confirm
the composite external-field-free switching strategy can also work for a 10 x
10 nm2 circular pillar. Compared with other proposed methods for
external-field-free spin Hall switching of perpendicular magnetization, the
dipole-coupled composite structure is compatible with a wide range of spin Hall
systems and perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions, paving the way towards
practical SHE-based MRAM and logic applications.

what quantum mechanics means in terms of basic philosophical questions about

the ways in which the enduring lack of an agreed upon interpretation of quantum
physics influences a number of critical philosophical debates about physics and
reality. I briefly review two problems effected by quantum interpretations: the
meaning of the term 'Universe' and the nature of consciousness. In what follows
I am explicitly not advocating for any particular quantum interpretation.
Instead, I am interested in how the explicit inability of modern physics to
experimentally distinguish between interpretations with wildly divergent
ontological/epistemological implications plays into discussions of physics and
its description of the world.
