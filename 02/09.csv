technique for similarity search with strong performance guarantees in
high-dimensional spaces. A drawback of traditional LSH schemes is that they may
have \emph{false negatives}, i.e., the recall is less than 100\%. This limits
the applicability of LSH in settings requiring precise performance guarantees.
Building on the recent theoretical ""CoveringLSH"" construction that eliminates
false negatives, we propose a fast and practical covering LSH scheme for
Hamming space called \emph{Fast CoveringLSH (fcLSH)}. Inheriting the design
benefits of CoveringLSH our method avoids false negatives and always reports
all near neighbors. Compared to CoveringLSH we achieve an asymptotic
improvement to the hash function computation time from $\mathcal{O}(dL)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(d + L\log{L})$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of data and $L$ is
the number of hash tables. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world data
sets demonstrate that \emph{fcLSH} is comparable (and often superior) to
traditional hashing-based approaches for search radius up to 20 in
high-dimensional Hamming space.

single occupied d-band. The center of the d-like maximally localized Wannier
function associated with this band is distributed among three M sites. Part of
the energy gap is opened by the crystal field splitting induced by the
X^-2-like atoms. We extract the hopping parameters for the Wannier functions
and provide a perspective on tight-binding model. From the analysis of the
tight binding model, we have found an inversion of the band character between
the Gamma and the K points of the Brillouin zone due to the M-M hybridization.
The consequence of this inversion is the closure of the gap. The M-X
hybridization is the only one that tends to open the gap at every k-point, the
change in the M-X and M-M hybridization is the main responsible for the
difference in the gap between the different dichalcogenide materials. The
inversion of the bands gives rise to different spin-orbit splitting at Gamma
and K point in the valence band. The different character of the gap at Gamma
and K point offers the chance to manipulate the semiconductive properties of
these compounds. For a bilayer system, the hybridizations between the out of
plane orbitals and the hybridizations between the in plane orbitals split the
valence band respectively at the Gamma and K point. The splitting in the

literature, we work in ZFC, do not require the categoricity cardinal to be a
successor, do not assume amalgamation, and do not use large cardinals. Moreover
we give an explicit bound on the ""high-enough"" threshold:
  $\mathbf{Theorem}$
  Let $\psi$ be a universal $\mathbb{L}_{\omega_1, \omega}$ sentence. If $\psi$
is categorical in some $\lambda \ge \beth_{\beth_{\omega_1}}$, then $\psi$ is
categorical in all $\lambda' \ge \beth_{\beth_{\omega_1}}$.

spectrally-smooth foregrounds (known as the wedge) and spectrally-structured 21

known to possess spectral structure due to Faraday rotation, which can leak
into the EoR window. In this work, we create and analyze 2D power spectra from

perturbation theory up to fourth order within the heavy-baryon expansion and a

We discuss in detail the renormalization of the various low-energy constants
and provide explicit expressions for the relevant $\beta$-functions and the
finite subtractions of the power-counting breaking terms within the covariant
formulation. To estimate the theoretical uncertainty from the truncation of the
chiral expansion, we employ an approach which has been successfully applied in
the most recent analysis of the nuclear forces. This allows us to reliably
extract the relevant low-energy constants from the available scattering data at
low energy. The obtained results provide a clear evidence that the breakdown
scale of the chiral expansion for this reaction is related to the
$\Delta$-resonance. The explicit inclusion of the leading contributions of the
$\Delta$-isobar is demonstrated to substantially increase the range of
applicability of the effective field theory. The resulting predictions for the
phase shifts are in an excellent agreement with the ones from the recent

reduction we understand the following familiar heuristic: Set the rate of
change for certain (a priori chosen) variables equal to zero and use the
resulting algebraic equations to obtain a system of smaller dimension for the
remaining variables. This procedure will generally be valid only for certain
parameter ranges. We start by showing that the reduction is accurate if and
only if the corresponding parameter is what we call a QSS parameter value, and
that the reduction is approximately accurate if and only if the corresponding
parameter is close to a QSS parameter value. These QSS parameter values can be
characterized by polynomial equations and inequations, hence parameter ranges
for which QSS reduction is valid are accessible in an algorithmic manner. A
closer investigation of QSS parameter values and the associated systems shows
the existence of certain invariant sets; here singular perturbations enter the
picture in a natural manner. We compare QSS reduction and singular perturbation

for the large-scale eigenvalue problem in the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE)
based on the reduced basis approach via low-rank factorizations in generating
matrices, introduced in the previous paper. The approach reduces numerical
costs down to $\mathcal{O}(N_b^2)$ in the size of atomic orbitals basis set,
$N_b$, instead of practically intractable $\mathcal{O}(N_b^6)$ complexity
scaling for the direct diagonalization of the BSE matrix. As an alternative to
rank approximation of the static screen interaction part of the BSE matrix, we
propose to restrict it to a small active sub-block, with a size balancing the
storage for rank-structured representations of other matrix blocks. We
demonstrate that the enhanced reduced-block approximation exhibits higher
precision within the controlled numerical cost, providing as well a distinct
two-sided error estimate for the BSE eigenvalues. It is shown that further
reduction of the asymptotic computational cost is possible due to ALS-type
iteration in block tensor train (TT) format applied to the quantized-TT (QTT)
tensor representation of both long eigenvectors and rank-structured matrix
blocks. The QTT-rank of these entities possesses almost the same magnitude as
the number of occupied orbitals in the molecular systems, $N_o$, hence the
overall asymptotic complexity for solving the BSE problem can be estimated by
$\mathcal{O}(\log(N_o) N_o^{2})$. We confirm numerically a considerable
decrease in computational time for the presented iterative approach applied to
various compact and chain-type molecules, while supporting sufficient accuracy.

corresponding to both scalar and tensor degrees of freedom which may exist at
null infinity and perturb the asymptotic data. Therefore, BMS transformations
generate physically inequivalent vacua as they populate the universe at null
infinity with these physical degrees of freedom. We also discuss the
gravitational memory effect when cosmological expansion is taken into account.
In this case, there are extra contribution to the gravitational memory due to
the tail of the retarded Green functions which are supported not only on the
light-cone, but also in its interior. The gravitational memory effect can be
understood also from an asymptotic point of view as a transition among
cosmological BMS-related vacua.

implementation is more complicated than, for instance, the Gillespie algorithm,
which is widely used to simulate the chemical master equation, and can be
implemented with a few lines of code. Here, we present an algorithm which does
not modify the way in which the master equation is solved, but instead modifies
the transition rates, and can thus be implemented with a few lines of code. It
works for all models in which reversible reactions occur by replacing such
reversible reactions with effective net reactions. Examples of such systems
include reaction-diffusion systems, in which diffusion is modelled by a random
walk. The random movement of particles between neighbouring sites is then
replaced with a net random flux. Furthermore, as we modify the transition rates
of the model, rather than its implementation on a computer, our method can be
combined with existing algorithms that were designed to speed up simulations of
the stochastic master equation. By focusing on some specific models, we show
how our algorithm can significantly speed up model simulations while
maintaining essential features of the original model.

spaces can be traced back to von Neumann's foundational works in the thirties.
The absence of a suitable quaternionic version of spectrum prevented the full
development of the theory. The first rigorous quaternionic formulation has been
started only in 2007 with the definition of the spherical spectrum of a
quaternionic operator based on a quadratic version of resolvent operator. The
relevance of this notion is proved by the existence of a quaternionic
continuous functional calculus and a theory of quaternionic semigroups relying
upon it. A problem of quaternionic formulation is the description of composite
quantum systems in absence of a natural tensor product due to non-commutativity
of quaternions. A promising tool towards a solution is a quaternionic
projection-valued measure (PVM), making possible a tensor product of
quaternionic operators with physical relevance. A notion with this property,
called intertwining quaternionic PVM, is presented here. This foundational
paper aims to investigate the interplay of this new mathematical object and the
spherical spectral features of quaternionic generally unbounded normal
operators. We discover in particular the existence of other spectral notions
equivalent to the spherical ones, but based on a standard non-quadratic notion
of resolvent operator.

braided relations for parafermion algebras which one can use in the study of
quantum information. An important ingredient in planar para algebra theory is
the string Fourier transform (SFT), that we use on the matrix algebra generated
by the Pauli matrices. Two different reflections play an important role in the
theory of planar para algebras. One is the adjoint operator; the other is the
modular conjugation in Tomita-Takesaki theory. We use the latter one to define

diffusion in a cosmological scalar field. We show that the diffusion dynamics
compel the interior to be spatially homogeneous, by which one can infer
immediately that within our model, and in contrast to the diffusion-free case,
no naked singularities can form in the gravitational collapse. We then study
the problem of matching an exterior Bondi type metric to the surface of the
star and find that the exterior can be chosen to be a modified Vaidya metric
with variable cosmological constant. Finally, we study in detail the causal
structure of an explicit, self-similar solution.

Paradox: they are less popular than their friends on average. This effect may
explain recent findings that widespread social network media use leads to
reduced happiness. However the relation between popularity and happiness is
poorly understood. A Friendship paradox does not necessarily imply a Happiness
paradox where most individuals are less happy than their friends. Here we
report the first direct observation of a significant Happiness Paradox in a
large-scale online social network of $39,110$ Twitter users. Our results reveal
that popular individuals are indeed happier and that a majority of individuals
experience a significant Happiness paradox. The magnitude of the latter effect
is shaped by complex interactions between individual popularity, happiness, and
the fact that users cluster assortatively by level of happiness. Our results
indicate that the topology of online social networks and the distribution of
happiness in some populations can cause widespread psycho-social effects that
affect the well-being of billions of individuals.

learning. With constant learning rates, it is a stochastic process that, after
an initial phase of convergence, generates samples from a stationary
distribution. We show that SGD with constant rates can be effectively used as
an approximate posterior inference algorithm for probabilistic modeling.
Specifically, we show how to adjust the tuning parameters of SGD such as to
match the resulting stationary distribution to the posterior. This analysis
rests on interpreting SGD as a continuous-time stochastic process and then
minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between its stationary distribution
and the target posterior. (This is in the spirit of variational inference.) In
more detail, we model SGD as a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and then
use properties of this process to derive the optimal parameters. This
theoretical framework also connects SGD to modern scalable inference
algorithms; we analyze the recently proposed stochastic gradient Fisher scoring
under this perspective. We demonstrate that SGD with properly chosen constant
rates gives a new way to optimize hyperparameters in probabilistic models.

whether the model satisfies the objective. We study polynomial-time problems in

to several fundamental $\omega$-regular objectives, e.g., Rabin and Streett
objectives. For many of these problems the best-known upper bounds are
quadratic or cubic, yet no super-linear lower bounds are known. In this work
our contributions are two-fold: First, we present several improved algorithms,
and second, we present the first conditional super-linear lower bounds based on
widely believed assumptions about the complexity of CNF-SAT and combinatorial
Boolean matrix multiplication. A separation result for two models with respect
to an objective means a conditional lower bound for one model that is strictly
higher than the existing upper bound for the other model, and similarly for two
objectives with respect to a model. Our results establish the following
separation results: (1) A separation of models (graphs and MDPs) for
disjunctive queries of reachability and B\""uchi objectives. (2) Two kinds of
separations of objectives, both for graphs and MDPs, namely, (2a) the
separation of dual objectives such as reachability/safety (for disjunctive
questions) and Streett/Rabin objectives, and (2b) the separation of conjunction

B\""uchi, and coB\""uchi. In summary, our results establish the first model and
objective separation results for graphs and MDPs for various classical

it not only determines the optical properties of these low-dimensional
materials, but also holds the key in revealing the underlying character of the

energy-loss spectroscopy and spectral analysis of angle-integrated spectra to
study the evolution of the anisotropic electronic transition involving the low
energy valence electrons in the freestanding MoS$_2$ layers with different
thicknesses. We are able to demonstrate that the well-known direct gap at 1.8

with the much smaller anisotropic response found for the indirect gap in the

states associated with the indirect gap transition in the multilayer systems

characteristic three-dimensional-like character. We attribute this to the
soft-edge behavior of the confining potential and it is an important factor

  Using Recurrent Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In clinical data sets we often find static information (e.g. patient gender,
blood type, etc.) combined with sequences of data that are recorded during
multiple hospital visits (e.g. medications prescribed, tests performed, etc.).
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have proven to be very successful for
modelling sequences of data in many areas of Machine Learning. In this work we
present an approach based on RNNs, specifically designed for the clinical
domain, that combines static and dynamic information in order to predict future
events. We work with a database collected in the Charit\'{e} Hospital in Berlin
that contains complete information concerning patients that underwent a kidney
transplantation. After the transplantation three main endpoints can occur:
rejection of the kidney, loss of the kidney and death of the patient. Our goal
is to predict, based on information recorded in the Electronic Health Record of
each patient, whether any of those endpoints will occur within the next six or
twelve months after each visit to the clinic. We compared different types of
RNNs that we developed for this work, with a model based on a Feedforward
Neural Network and a Logistic Regression model. We found that the RNN that we
developed based on Gated Recurrent Units provides the best performance for this
task. We also used the same models for a second task, i.e., next event
prediction, and found that here the model based on a Feedforward Neural Network
outperformed the other models. Our hypothesis is that long-term dependencies
are not as relevant in this task.

is that it imposes an additional constraint to restrict the optimal weight

angles neighboring to the estimated DoA. Unlike many existing methods which
resort to a beamwidth expansion, the weight vector produced by SSC-DL has a
relatively small beamwidth around the DoA of the target signal. Yet, the SSC-DL
beamformer has a great interference suppression level, thereby achieving an
improved overall SINR performance. Simulation results suggest the proposed
method has a near-to-optimal SINR performance.

microorganisms, phoretic colloidal particles, and artificial micro-robotic
systems, moving in fluid-like environments. These environments can be
water-like and Newtonian but can frequently contain macromolecules, flexible
polymers, soft cells, or hard particles, which impart complex, nonlinear
rheological features to the fluid. While significant progress has been made on
understanding how active colloids move and interact in Newtonian fluids, little
is known on how active colloids behave in complex and non-Newtonian fluids. An
emerging literature is starting to show how fluid rheology can dramatically
change the gaits and speeds of individual swimmers. Simultaneously, a moving
swimmer induces time dependent, three dimensional fluid flows, that can modify
the medium (fluid) rheological properties. This two-way, non-linear coupling at
microscopic scales has profound implications at meso- and macro-scales: steady
state suspension properties, emergent collective behavior, and transport of
passive tracer particles. Recent exciting theoretical results and current
debate on quantifying these complex active fluids highlight the need for
conceptually simple experiments to guide our understanding.

solved using a weighted least squares formulation. Unlike other non-oscillatory

Their implementation on top of an n-process asynchronous message-passing system

(where t is the maximal number of processes that may crash) is a necessary and
sufficient requirement to build an atomic register on top of a crash-prone
asynchronous message-passing system. Considering such a context, this paper
presents an algorithm which implements a single-writer multi-reader atomic
register with four message types only, and where no message needs to carry
control information in addition to its type. Hence, two bits are sufficient to
capture all the control information carried by all the implementation messages.
Moreover, the messages of two types need to carry a data value while the
messages of the two other types carry no value at all. As far as we know, this
algorithm is the first with such an optimality property on the size of control
information carried by messages. It is also particularly efficient from a time
complexity point of view.

Potential attacks include having malicious content like malware identified as

a remotely hosted DNN with no such knowledge. Indeed, the only capability of
our black-box adversary is to observe labels given by the DNN to chosen inputs.
Our attack strategy consists in training a local model to substitute for the
target DNN, using inputs synthetically generated by an adversary and labeled by
the target DNN. We use the local substitute to craft adversarial examples, and
find that they are misclassified by the targeted DNN. To perform a real-world

deep learning API. We find that their DNN misclassifies 84.24% of the
adversarial examples crafted with our substitute. We demonstrate the general
applicability of our strategy to many ML techniques by conducting the same
attack against models hosted by Amazon and Google, using logistic regression
substitutes. They yield adversarial examples misclassified by Amazon and Google

consistent with a flat velocity dispersion profile, and with an upper limit of

therefore, be significantly smaller than the upper limit reported here. An

ordered, the past years have seen the frontier between order and spin liquid
starting to fade, with a growing number of materials whose low-temperature
physics cannot be explained without co-existence of (partial) magnetic order
and spin fluctuations. Here we study an example of such co-existence in the
presence of magnetic dipolar interactions, related to spin ice, where the order
is long range and the fluctuations support a Coulomb gauge field. Topological
defects are effectively coupled via energetic and entropic Coulomb
interactions, the latter one being stronger than for the spin-ice ground state.
Depending on whether these defects break the divergence-free condition of the
Coulomb gauge field or the long-range order, they are respectively categorized
as monopoles - as in spin ice - or monopole holes, in analogy with electron
holes in semiconductors. The long-range order plays the role of a
fully-occupied valence band, while the Coulomb spin liquid can be seen as an
empty conducting band. These results are discussed in the context of other
lattices and models which support a similar co-existence of Coulomb gauge field
and long-range order. We conclude this work by explaining how dipolar
interactions lift the spin liquid degeneracy at very low energy scale by
maximizing the number of flippable plaquettes, in light of the equivalent
quantum dimer model.

for thousands of low-mass red-giant stars with the NASA space telescope Kepler.
Such modes have the potential to reveal information on the physics of the deep
stellar interior. Different methods have been proposed to derive an observed
value for the gravity-mode period spacing, the most prominent one relying on a
relation derived from asymptotic pulsation theory applied to the gravity-mode
character of the mixed modes. Our aim is to compare results based on this
asymptotic relation with those derived from an empirical approach for three
pulsating red-giant stars. We developed a data-driven method to perform
frequency extraction and mode identification. Next, we used the identified
dipole mixed modes to determine the gravity-mode period spacing by means of an
empirical method and by means of the asymptotic relation. In our methodology,
we consider the phase offset, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{g}}$, of the asymptotic
relation as a free parameter. Using the frequencies of the identified dipole
mixed modes for each star in the sample, we derived a value for the
gravity-mode period spacing using the two different methods. These differ by
less than 5%. The average precision we achieved for the period spacing derived
from the asymptotic relation is better than 1%, while that of our data-driven
approach is 3%. Good agreement is found between values for the period spacing
derived from the asymptotic relation and from the empirical method.

two-node and three-node, in the context of cellular networks where the
terminals employ directional antennas. The simultaneous transmission and
reception of data in non-orthogonal channels makes FD radio a potential
solution for the currently limited spectrum. However, its implementation
generates high levels of interference either in the form of loopback
interference (LI) from the output to the input antenna of a transceiver or in
the form of co-channel interference in large-scale multicell networks due to
the large number of active links. Using a stochastic geometry model, we
investigate how directional antennas can control and mitigate the co-channel
interference. Furthermore, we provide a model which characterizes the way
directional antennas manage the LI in order to passively suppress it. Our
results show that both architectures can benefit significantly by the
employment of directional antennas. Finally, we consider the case where both
architectures are employed in the network and derive the optimal values for the
density fraction of each architecture which maximize the success probability

registration. We investigate how this accuracy can be estimated without ground

multi-modal pair of images. At the local scale of image fragments, the
Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on registration error is estimated for each local
correspondence between coarsely registered pair of images. This CRLB is defined
by local image texture and noise properties. Opposite to the standard approach,
where registration accuracy is only evaluated at the output of the registration
process, such valuable information is used by us as an additional input
knowledge. It greatly helps detecting and discarding outliers and refining the
estimation of geometrical transformation model parameters. Based on these
ideas, a new area-based registration method called RAE (Registration with
Accuracy Estimation) is proposed. In addition to its ability to automatically
register very complex multimodal image pairs with high accuracy, the RAE method
provides registration accuracy at the global scale as covariance matrix of
estimation error of geometrical transformation model parameters or as
point-wise registration Standard Deviation. This accuracy does not depend on
any ground truth availability and characterizes each pair of registered images
individually. Thus, the RAE method can identify image areas for which a
predefined registration accuracy is guaranteed. The RAE method is proved
successful with reaching subpixel accuracy while registering eight complex
mono/multimodal and multitemporal image pairs including optical to optical,
optical to radar, optical to Digital Elevation Model (DEM) images and DEM to
radar cases. Other methods employed in comparisons fail to provide in a stable
manner accurate results on the same test cases.

  We then focus on $\ell_1$-regularized optimization, which is the ubiquitous
special case where the nonsmooth term is the $\ell_1$-norm. For certain
parameter choices, GIPSA is amenable to a local analysis for this problem. For
these choices we show that GIPSA achieves finite ""active manifold
identification"", i.e. convergence in a finite number of iterations to the
optimal support and sign, after which GIPSA reduces to minimizing a local
smooth function. Local linear convergence then holds under certain conditions.
We determine the rate in terms of the inertia, stepsize, and local curvature.
Our local analysis is applicable to certain recent variants of the Fast
Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA), for which we establish
active manifold identification and local linear convergence. Our analysis
motivates the use of a momentum restart scheme in these FISTA variants to
obtain the optimal local linear convergence rate.

cloud cores can suppress the formation of a rotationally supported disk (RSD)
through catastrophic magnetic braking in the axisymmetric ideal MHD limit. In
this study, we present conditions for the formation of RSDs through non-ideal
MHD effects computed self-consistently from an equilibrium chemical network. We
find that removing from the standard MRN distribution the large population of
very small grains (VSGs) of ~10 $\AA$ to few 100 $\AA$ that dominate the
coupling of the bulk neutral matter to the magnetic field increases the
ambipolar diffusivity by ~1--2 orders of magnitude at densities below 10$^{10}$
cm$^{-3}$. The enhanced ambipolar diffusion (AD) in the envelope reduces the
amount of magnetic flux dragged by the collapse into the circumstellar
disk-forming region. Therefore, magnetic braking is weakened and more angular
momentum can be retained. With continuous high angular momentum inflow, RSDs of
tens of AU are able to form, survive, and even grow in size, depending on other
parameters including cosmic-ray ionization rate, magnetic field strength, and
rotation speed. Some disks become self-gravitating and evolve into rings in our
2D (axisymmetric) simulations, which have the potential to fragment into
(close) multiple systems in 3D. We conclude that disk formation in magnetized
cores is highly sensitive to chemistry, especially to grain sizes. A moderate
grain coagulation/growth to remove the large population of VSGs, either in the
prestellar phase or during free-fall collapse, can greatly promote AD and help
formation of tens of AU RSDs.

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). For a long GRB, the induced gravitational collapse
(IGC) paradigm proposes as progenitor, or ""in-state"", a tight binary system
composed of a carbon-oxygen core (CO$_{core}$) undergoing a supernova (SN)
explosion which triggers hypercritical accretion onto a neutron star (NS)
companion. For a short GRB, a NS-NS merger is traditionally adopted as the
progenitor. We divide long and short GRBs into two sub-classes, depending on
whether or not a black hole (BH) is formed in the merger or in the
hypercritical accretion process exceeding the NS critical mass. For long
bursts, when no BH is formed we have the sub-class of X-ray flashes (XRFs),
with isotropic energy $E_{iso}\lesssim10^{52}$ erg and rest-frame spectral peak
energy $E_{p,i}\lesssim200$ keV. When a BH is formed we have the sub-class of
binary-driven hypernovae (BdHNe), with $E_{iso}\gtrsim10^{52}$ erg and
$E_{p,i}\gtrsim200$ keV. In analogy, short bursts are similarly divided into
two sub-classes. When no BH is formed, short gamma-ray flashes (S-GRFs) occur,
with $E_{iso}\lesssim10^{52}$ erg and $E_{p,i}\lesssim2$ MeV. When a BH is
formed, the authentic short GRBs (S-GRBs) occur, with $E_{iso}\gtrsim10^{52}$
erg and $E_{p,i}\gtrsim2$ MeV. We give examples and observational signatures of
these four sub-classes and their rate of occurrence. From their respective
rates it is possible that ""in-states"" of S-GRFs and S-GRBs originate from the
""out-states"" of XRFs. We indicate two additional progenitor systems: white
dwarf-NS and BH-NS. These systems have hybrid features between long and short
bursts. In the case of S-GRBs and BdHNe evidence is given of the coincidence of
the onset of the high energy GeV emission with the birth of a Kerr BH.

demonstrated that water molecules align in response to an imposed temperature

peak strength of the field to range between $2 \times 10^7$ and $5 \times
10^7~\text{V/m}$ for a temperature gradient of $5.2~\text{K/}\unicode{x212B}$.
Our value for the Wolf method is therefore an order of magnitude lower than the
literature value [J. Chem. Phys. 139, 014504 (2013) and 143, 036101 (2015)]. We
show that this discrepancy can be traced back to the use of an incorrect kernel
in the calculation of the electrostatic field. More seriously, we find that the
Wolf method fails to predict correct molecular orientations, resulting in
dipole densities with opposite sign to those computed using Ewald summation. By
considering two different multipole expansions, we show that, for inhomogeneous
polarisations, the quadrupole contribution can be significant and even outweigh
the dipole contribution to the field. Finally, we propose a more accurate way
of calculating the electrostatic potential and the field. In particular, we
show that averaging the microscopic field analytically to obtain the
macroscopic Maxwell field reduces the error bars by up to an order of
magnitude. As a consequence, the simulation times required to reach a given
statistical accuracy decrease by up to two orders of magnitude.

models have been proposed in the literature so far. The Transient Impact Model
(TIM) posits that the price at high frequency time scales is a linear
combination of the signs of the past executed market orders, weighted by a
so-called propagator function. An alternative description -- the History
Dependent Impact Model (HDIM) -- assumes that the deviation between the
realised order sign and its expected level impacts the price linearly and
permanently. The two models, however, should be extended since prices are a
priori influenced not only by the past order flow, but also by the past
realisation of returns themselves. In this paper, we propose a two-event
framework, where price-changing and non price-changing events are considered
separately. Two-event propagator models provide a remarkable improvement of the
description of the market impact, especially for large tick stocks, where the
events of price changes are very rare and very informative. Specifically the
extended approach captures the excess anti-correlation between past returns and
subsequent order flow which is missing in one-event models. Our results
document the superior performances of the HDIMs even though only in minor
relative terms compared to TIMs. This is somewhat surprising, because HDIMs are
well grounded theoretically, while TIMs are, strictly speaking, inconsistent.

consider the injection rate as a design parameter and compute an optimum
injection rate that ensures that the risk of excess pressure buildup at the

algorithm is that it is free of parameters, therefore eliminating the need for
tuning parameters and allowing easy implementations. We establish that with
high probability, a low-rank PSD matrix can be exactly recovered as soon as the
number of measurements is large enough, even when a fraction of the
measurements are corrupted by outliers with arbitrary magnitudes. Moreover, the
recovery is also stable against bounded noise. With the additional information

states (DOS) near zero energy, using a combination of Lanczos on $H^2$ and the
kernel polynomial method on $H$. We establish the existence of two distinct
types of low energy eigenstates contributing to the disordered density of
states in the weak disorder semimetal regime. These are (i) typical eigenstates
that are well described by linearly dispersing perturbatively dressed Dirac
states, and (ii) nonperturbative rare eigenstates that are weakly-dispersive
and quasi-localized in the real space regions with the largest (and rarest)
local random potential. Using twisted boundary conditions, we are able to
systematically find and study these two types of eigenstates. We find that the
Dirac states contribute low energy peaks in the finite-size DOS that arise from
the clean eigenstates which shift and broaden in the presence of disorder. On
the other hand, we establish that the rare quasi-localized eigenstates
contribute a nonzero background DOS which is only weakly energy-dependent near
zero energy and is exponentially small at weak disorder. We find that the
expected semimetal to diffusive metal quantum critical point is converted to an
{\it avoided} quantum criticality that is ""rounded out"" by nonperturbative
effects, with no signs of any singular behavior in the DOS near the Dirac
energy. We discuss the implications of our results for disordered Dirac and

also affects the matter power spectrum (MPS) through the Meszaros effect and
the potential decay. Since the ensemble average energy density of the PMF is
not a first order perturbation but a zero order source in the linear
perturbation equations for the cosmology, to correctly understand the overall
effects of the PMF on the MPS, we should significantly revise previous
approaches to research for the MPS with the PMF by considering both the effects
of the zero and first order sources from the PMF in the linear perturbation
theory. We apply the effects of the zero order sources from the PMF to
theoretical computations of the MPS for the first time. We also analyze the
overall PMF effects on the MPS. The CMB polarizations are affected the weak
lensing. The weak lensing is determined by the MPS. Therefore, we have to
consider the zero order sources of the PMF to gain a correct understanding not
only of the MPS but also the CMB polarization.

directly modify the power of a gravitational lens. With the aim of
reestablishing a consensus on this issue, I conduct a comprehensive analysis of
gravitational lensing in the Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetime, wherein the
effects of $\Lambda$ should be most apparent. The effective lensing law is
found to be in precise agreement with the $\Lambda=0$ result:
$\alpha_\mathrm{eff} = 4m/b_\mathrm{eff}+15\pi m^2/4b_\mathrm{eff}^2
+O(m^3/b_\mathrm{eff}^3)$, where the effective bending angle
$\alpha_\mathrm{eff}$ and impact parameter $b_\mathrm{eff}$ are defined by the
angles and angular diameter distances measured by a comoving cosmological
observer. [These observers follow the timelike geodesic congruence which (i)
respects the continuous symmetries of the spacetime and (ii) approaches local
isotropy most rapidly at large distance from the lens.] The effective lensing
law can be derived using lensed or unlensed angular diameter distances,
although the inherent ambiguity of unlensed distances generates an additional
uncertainty $O(m^5/\Lambda b_\mathrm{eff}^7)$. I conclude that the cosmological
constant does not interfere with the standard gravitational lensing formalism.

complements color-based selection by selecting additional redder quasars, and
mitigates redshift biases to produce a smooth quasar redshift distribution over
a wide range of redshifts. The resulting quasar sample contains systematically
higher fractions of blazars and broad absorption line quasars than from
color-selected samples. Similarly, we show that M-dwarfs in the TDSS-selected

the underlying M-dwarf population, based on their H-alpha emission. TDSS also
contains a large number of RR Lyrae and eclipsing binary stars with
main-sequence colors, including a few composite-spectrum binaries. Finally, our

potentially capable of producing one solar mass of dust in their explosively
expelled ejecta. However, unlike other dust sources, the dust has to survive
the passage of the reverse shock, generated by the interaction of the supernova
blast wave with its surrounding medium. Knowledge of the net amount of dust
produced by CCSNe is crucial for understanding the origin and evolution of dust
in the local and high-redshift universe. Our aim is to identify the dust
destruction mechanisms in the ejecta, and derive the net amount of dust that
survives the passage of the reverse shock. We use analytical models for the
evolution of a supernova blast wave and of the reverse shock, with special
application to the clumpy ejecta of the remnant of Cassiopeia A. We assume that
the dust resides in cool oxygen-rich clumps that are uniformly distributed
within the remnant and surrounded by a hot X-ray emitting plasma, and that the
dust consists of silicates (MgSiO3) and amorphous carbon grains. The passage of
the reverse shock through the clumps gives rise to a relative gas-grain motion
and also destroys the clumps. Inside the ejecta clouds, dust is processed via
kinetic sputtering, which is terminated either when the grains escape the
clumps, or when the clumps are destroyed by the reverse shock. In either case,
grain destruction proceeds thereafter by thermal sputtering in the hot ambient
gas. We find that 11.8% and 15.9% of, respectively, the silicate and carbon
dust survives the passage of the reverse shock by the time the shock has
reached the center of the remnant. These fractions depend on the morphology of
the ejecta and the medium into which the remnant is expanding, as well as the
composition and size distribution of the grains that formed in the ejecta.
Results will therefore differ for different types of supernovae.

$\dot{\rm{M}}_s$ increases with AGN luminosity, up to a maximum of
$\sim600~\rm{M}_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, and with CIV FWHM. In context with previous
results, this is consistent with a relation between $\dot{\rm{M}}_s$ and black
hole accretion rate ($\dot{\rm{M}}_{bh}$) existing in only parts of the
$z-\dot{\rm{M}}_{s}-\dot{\rm{M}}_{bh}$ plane, dependent on the free gas
fraction, the trigger for activity, and the processes that may quench star
formation. The relations between $\dot{\rm{M}}_s$ and both AGN luminosity and
CIV FWHM are consistent with star formation rates in quasars scaling with black
hole mass, though we cannot rule out a separate relation with black hole
accretion rate. Star formation rates are observed to decline with increasing
CIV equivalent width. This decline can be partially explained via the Baldwin
effect, but may have an additional contribution from one or more of three
factors; $M_i$ is not a linear tracer of L$_{2500}$, the Baldwin effect changes
form at high AGN luminosities, and high CIV EW values signpost a change in the
relation between $\dot{\rm{M}}_s$ and $\dot{\rm{M}}_{bh}$. Finally, there is no
strong relation between $\dot{\rm{M}}_s$ and Eddington ratio, or the asymmetry
of the CIV line. The former suggests that star formation rates do not scale
with how efficiently the black hole is accreting, while the latter is
consistent with CIV asymmetries arising from orientation effects.

increasing SFR and dust attenuation. However, at the highest masses and dust
attenuations, we detect individual galaxies with f$_{\rm esc}$ much higher than

of f$_{\rm esc}$. Relations between f$_{\rm esc}$ and UV slope are bimodal,
with high f$_{\rm esc}$ for either the bluest or reddest galaxies. We speculate
that this bimodality and large scatter in the values of f$_{\rm esc}$ is due to
additional physical mechanisms such as outflows facilitating f$_{\rm esc}$ for
dusty/massive systems. Ly$\alpha$ is significantly more extended than H$\alpha$

derived from unresolved HI line widths tend to produce slopes of 3.3, while
measurements derived from asymptotic rotation curves tend to produce slopes of
3.9. The largest factor affecting the BTFR slope is the definition of $V_{\rm

of super-Earth masses and radii. Such measurements are used in internal
structure models to constrain interior compositions of super-Earths. It is now
critically important to quantify the effect of various model assumptions on the
predicted radii. In particular, models often neglect thermal effects, a choice
justified by noting that the thermal expansion of a solid Earth-like planet is
small. However, the thermal effects for water-rich interiors may be
significant. We have systematically explored the extent to which thermal
effects can influence the radii of water-rich super-Earths over a wide range of
masses, surface temperatures, surface pressures and water mass fractions. We
developed temperature-dependent internal structure models of water-rich
super-Earths that include a comprehensive temperature-dependent water equation
of state. We found that thermal effects induce significant changes in their
radii. For example, for super-Earths with 10 per cent water by mass, the radius
increases by up to 0.5$\,$R$_\oplus$ when the surface temperature is increased
from 300 to 1000$\,$K, assuming a surface pressure of 100$\,$bar and an
adiabatic temperature gradient in the water layer. The increase is even larger
at lower surface pressures and/or higher surface temperatures, while changing
the water fraction makes only a marginal difference. These effects are
comparable to current super-Earth radial measurement errors, which can be
better than 0.1$\,$R$_\oplus$. It is therefore important to ensure that the
thermal behaviour of water is taken into account when interpreting super-Earth
radii using internal structure models.

study super-Earth atmospheres of diverse bulk composition, which are assumed to
form by outgassing from a solid core of chondritic material, following Schaefer
& Fegley (2010). The super-Earth atmospheres that we study arise from planetary
cores made up of individual types of chondritic meteorites. They range from
highly reducing to oxidizing and have carbon to oxygen (C:O) ratios that are
both subsolar and super-solar, thereby spanning a range of atmospheric
composition that is appropriate for low-mass exoplanets. Given the atomic
makeup of these atmospheres, we minimize the global Gibbs free energy of
formation for over 550 gases and condensates to obtain the molecular
composition of the atmospheres over a temperature range of 350-3,000 K. Clouds
should form along the temperature-pressure boundaries where the condensed
species appear in our calculation. We find that the composition of condensate
clouds depends strongly on both the H:O and C:O ratios. For the super-Earth
archetype GJ 1214b, KCl and ZnS are the primary cloud-forming condensates at
solar composition, in agreement with previous work (Morley et al. 2013;
Miller-Ricci Kempton et al. 2012). However, for oxidizing atmospheres, K2SO4

recently discovered in the Galactic center. Following earlier studies
suggesting that these two clouds are part of a larger gas streamer, we combine
their orbits into a single trajectory. Since the gas clouds experience a drag
force from background gas, this trajectory is not exactly Keplerian. By
assuming the G1 and G2 clouds trace this trajectory, we fit for the drag force
they experience and thus extract information about the accretion flow at a
distance of thousands of Schwarzschild radii from the black hole. This range of
radii is important for theories of black hole accretion, but is currently
unconstrained by observations.
  In this paper we extend our previous work by accounting for radial forces due
to possible inflow or outflow of the background gas. Such radial forces drive
precession in the orbital plane, allowing a slightly better fit to the G1 and
G2 data. This precession delays the pericenter passage of G2 by 4-5 months
relative to estimates derived from a Keplerian orbital fit; if it proves
possible to identify the pericenter time observationally, this enables an
immediate test of whether G1 and G2 are gas clouds part of a larger gas
streamer. If G2 is indeed a gas cloud, its closest approach likely occurred in
late summer 2014, after many of the observing campaigns monitoring G2's
anticipated pericenter passage ended. We discuss how this affects

to form a YMC, and compare their radial gas mass distributions to the stellar
mass distribution of Galactic YMCs. We find that the gas in the progenitor
clouds is distributed differently than the stars in YMCs. The mass surface
density profiles of the gas clouds are generally shallower than the stellar
mass surface density profiles of the YMCs, which are characterised by prominent
dense core regions with radii ~ 0.1 pc, followed by a power-law tail. On the
scale of YMC core radii, we find that there are no known clouds with
significantly more mass in their central regions when compared to Galactic
YMCs. Additionally, we find that models in which stars form from very dense
initial conditions require surface densities that are generally higher than
those seen in the known candidate YMC progenitor clouds. Our results show that
the quiescent, less evolved clouds contain less mass in their central regions
than in the highly star-forming clouds. This suggests an evolutionary trend in
which clouds continue to accumulate mass towards their centres after the onset
of star formation. We conclude that a conveyor-belt scenario for YMC formation
is consistent with the current sample of Galactic YMCs and their progenitor
clouds.

and luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN) in terms of a simple picture
involving a central black hole, an accretion disc and an associated outflow.
Here, we continue our tests of this paradigm by comparing quasar spectra to
synthetic spectra of biconical disc wind models, produced with our
state-of-the-art Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. Previously, we have shown
that we could produce synthetic spectra resembling those of observed broad
absorption line (BAL) quasars, but only if the X-ray luminosity was limited to
$10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Here, we introduce a simple treatment of clumping, and
find that a filling factor of $\sim0.01$ moderates the ionization state
sufficiently for BAL features to form in the rest-frame UV at more realistic
X-ray luminosities. Our fiducial model shows good agreement with AGN X-ray
properties and the wind produces strong line emission in, e.g., Ly \alpha\ and
CIV 1550\AA\ at low inclinations. At high inclinations, the spectra possess
prominent LoBAL features. Despite these successes, we cannot reproduce all
emission lines seen in quasar spectra with the correct equivalent-width ratios,
and we find an angular dependence of emission-line equivalent width despite the
similarities in the observed emission line properties of BAL and non-BAL
quasars. Overall, our work suggests that biconical winds can reproduce much of
the qualitative behaviour expected from a unified model, but we cannot yet
provide quantitative matches with quasar properties at all viewing angles.
Whether disc winds can successfully unify quasars is therefore still an open
question.

It is not yet clear, however, whether metallicity-environment dependencies are
merely an indirect consequence of environmentally dependent formation
histories, or of environment related processes directly affecting metallicity.
Here, we present a first detailed study of metallicity-environment correlations
in a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, in particular the Illustris
simulation. Illustris galaxies display similar relations to those observed.
Utilizing our knowledge of simulated formation histories, and leveraging the
large simulation volume, we construct galaxy samples of satellites and centrals
that are matched in formation histories. This allows us to find that ~1/3 of
the metallicity-environment correlation is due to different formation histories
in different environments. This is a combined effect of satellites (in
particular, in denser environments) having on average lower z=0 star formation
rates (SFRs), and of their older stellar ages, even at a given z=0 SFR. Most of
the difference, ~2/3, however, is caused by the higher concentration of
star-forming disks of satellite galaxies, as this biases their SFR-weighted
metallicities toward their inner, more metal-rich parts. With a newly defined
quantity, the 'radially averaged' metallicity, which captures the metallicity
profile but is independent of the SFR profile, the metallicities of satellites
and centrals become environmentally independent once they are matched in
formation history. We find that circumgalactic metallicity (defined as rapidly
inflowing gas around the virial radius), while sensitive to environment, has no
measurable effect on the metallicity of the star-forming gas inside the
galaxies.

(SNe) allow an accurate and robust measurement of the product of the radiation
energy in the ejecta, $E_r$, and the time since the explosion, $t$, at early
phases ($t\lesssim 10d$) of the homologous expansion. This observable, denoted
here $ET \equiv E_rt$ is constant during that time and depends only on the
progenitor structure and explosion energy. We use a 1D hydrodynamic code to
find $ET$ of simulated explosions of 145 red supergiant progenitors obtained
using the stellar evolution code MESA, and relate this observable to the
properties of the progenitor and the explosion energy. We show that $ET$ probes
only the properties of the envelope (velocity, mass and initial structure),
similarly to other observables that rely on the photospheric phase emission.
Nevertheless, for explosions where the envelope dominates the ejected mass,
$M_{env}/M_{ej} \gtrsim 0.6$, $ET$ is directly related to the explosion energy
$E_{exp}$ and ejected mass $M_{ej}$ through the relation $ET \approx 0.15
E_{exp}^{1/2} R_* M_{ej}^{1/2}$, where $R_*$ is the progenitor radius, to an
accuracy better than $30\%$. We also provide relations between $ET$ and the
envelope properties that are accurate (to within 20\%) for all the progenitors
in our sample, including those that lost most of their envelope. We show that
when the envelope velocity can be reasonably measured by line shifts in
observed spectra, the envelope is directly constrained from the bolometric
light curve (independent of $E_{exp}$). We use that to compare observations of
11 SNe with measured $ET$ and envelope velocity to our sample of numerical
progenitors. This comparison suggests that many SNe progenitors have radii that
are $\lesssim 500~R_\odot$. In the framework of our simulations this indicates,
most likely, a rather high value of the mixing length parameter.

that the fluctuations of the inversion symmetry breaking order lead to two
degenerate superconducting (SC) instabilities, one in the $s$-wave channel, and
the other in a time-reversal invariant odd-parity pairing channel (the simplest
case being the same as the of $^3$He-B phase). Remarkably, we find that unlike
many well-known examples, the selection of the pairing symmetry of the
condensate is independent of the momentum-space structure of the collective
mode that mediates the pairing interaction. We found that this degeneracy is a
result of the existence of a conserved fermionic helicity, $\chi$, and the two
degenerate channels correspond to even and odd combinations of SC order
parameters with $\chi=\pm1$. As a result, the system has an enlarged symmetry
$U(1)\times U(1)$, with each $U(1)\times U(1)$ corresponding to one value of
the helicity $\chi$. Because of the enlarged symmetry, this system admits
exotic topological defects such as a fractional quantum vortex, which we show
has a Majorana zero mode bound at its core. We discuss how the enlarged
symmetry can be lifted by small perturbations, such as the Coulomb interaction
or Fermi surface splitting in the presence of broken inversion symmetry, and we
show that the resulting superconducting state can be topological or trivial
depending on parameters. The $U(1)\times U(1)$ symmetry is restored at the
phase boundary between the topological and trivial SC states, and allows for a
transition between topologically distinct SC phases without the vanishing of

not correlate with other global galaxy properties such as stellar mass, SFR,
and metallicity. The mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at $z\simeq3.3$ shows
lower metallicity by $\simeq 0.7$ dex than that at $z=0$ at the same stellar
mass. Our sample shows an offset by $\simeq 0.3$ dex from the locally defined
mass-metallicity-SFR relation, indicating that simply extrapolating such
relation to higher redshift may predict an incorrect evolution of MZR.
Furthermore, within the uncertainties we find no SFR-metallicity correlation,
suggesting a less important role of SFR in controlling the metallicity at high
redshift. We finally investigate the redshift evolution of the MZR by using the
model by Lilly et al. (2013), finding that the observed evolution from $z=0$ to
$z\simeq3.3$ can be accounted for by the model assuming a weak redshift
evolution of the star formation efficiency.

the viewing angle of the scattering material. We here report the results of a
pilot study of VLT spectropolarimetric observations of the RL NLSy1 PKS
2004-447. Its polarization properties are remarkably well reproduced by models
in which the scattering occurs in an equatorial structure surrounding its broad
line region, seen close to face-on. In particular, we detect a polarized
H$\alpha$ line with a width of $\sim$ 9,000 km s$^{-1}$, $\sim 6$ times broader
than the width seen in direct light. This corresponds to a revised estimate of
$M_{\rm BH}$$\sim$$6\times10^8$ M$_\odot$, well within the typical range of RL
AGN. The double-peaked polarized broad H$\alpha$ profile of the target suggests
that the rare combination of the orientation effects and a broad line region

and spectral resolution kinematic Halpha Fabry-Perot observations. In

slope dRvc(0). We explore the relationship between the inner slope and several
galaxy parameters, such as stellar mass, maximum rotational velocity, central
surface brightness ({\mu}0), bar strength and bulge-to-total ratio. Even with
our limited dynamical range, we find a trend for low-mass galaxies to exhibit
shallower rotation curve inner slopes than high-mass galaxies, whereas steep
inner slopes are found exclusively in high-mass galaxies. This trend may arise
from the relationship between the total stellar mass and the mass of the bulge,
which are correlated among them. We find a correlation between the inner slope
of the rotation curve and the morphological T-type, complementary to the
scaling relation between dRvc(0) and {\mu}0 previously reported in the
literature. Although we find that the inner slope increases with the Fourier
amplitude A2 and decreases with the bar torque Qb, this may arise from the
presence of the bulge implicit in both A2 and Qb. As previously noted in the
literature, the more compact the mass in the central parts of a galaxy (more
concretely, the presence of a bulge), the steeper the inner slopes. We conclude
that the baryonic matter dominates the dynamics in the central parts of our
sample galaxies.

index of Larson's first law, the size-linewidth relation, is consistent with
0.5 in all regions - possibly due to an observational bias - but clouds in the
inner Galaxy systematically have significantly (~ 30%) higher linewidths at a
given size, indicating that their linewidths are set in part by Galactic
environment. The mass functions of clouds in the inner Galaxy versus the outer
Galaxy are both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct. The inner Galaxy
mass spectrum is best described by a truncated power-law with a power index of
$\gamma=-1.6\pm0.1$ and an upper truncation mass $M_0 = (1.0 \pm 0.2) \times

theory of ""zero-determinant"" (or, more generally, ""autocratic"") strategies to
alternating games, which are often biologically more relevant than traditional
synchronous games. Alternating games naturally result in asymmetries between
players because the first move matters or because players might not move with
equal probabilities. In a strictly-alternating game with two players, $X$ and
$Y$, we give conditions for the existence of autocratic strategies for player
$X$ when (i) $X$ moves first and (ii) $Y$ moves first. Furthermore, we show
that autocratic strategies exist even for (iii) games with randomly-alternating
moves. Particularly important categories of autocratic strategies are
extortionate and generous strategies, which enforce unfavorable and favorable
outcomes for the opponent, respectively. We illustrate these strategies using
the continuous Donation Game, in which a player pays a cost to provide a
benefit to the opponent according to a continuous cooperative investment level.
Asymmetries due to alternating moves could easily arise from dominance
hierarchies, and we show that they can endow subordinate players with more
autocratic strategies than dominant players.

to understand the cluster merger process and further the formation and
evolution of the large-scale structure of the universe. In this paper, we
explore a baryonic effect on the merger timescale of galaxy clusters by using
hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the baryons play an important role in
accelerating the merger process. The merger timescale decreases with increasing
the gas fraction of galaxy clusters. For example, the merger timescale is
shortened by a factor of up to 3 for merging clusters with gas fractions 0.15,
compared with the timescale obtained with zero gas fractions. The baryonic
effect is significant for a wide range of merger parameters and especially more
significant for nearly head-on mergers and high merging velocities. The
baryonic effect on the merger timescale of galaxy clusters is expected to have
impacts on the structure formation in the universe, such as the cluster mass
function and massive substructures in galaxy clusters, and a bias of ""no-gas""
may exist in the results obtained from the dark matter-only cosmological
simulations.

in the two massive components of Beta Cen with BRITE-Constellation photometry.
In addition, seismic models for the components are considered and the effects
of fast rotation are discussed. This is done to test the limitations of seismic
modeling for this very difficult case. A simultaneous fit of visual and
spectroscopic orbits is used to self-consistently derive the orbital
parameters, and subsequently the masses, of the components. The derived masses
are equal to 12.02 +/- 0.13 and 10.58 +/- 0.18 M_Sun. The parameters of the
wider, A - B system, presently approaching periastron passage, are constrained.
Analysis of the combined blue- and red-filter BRITE-Constellation photometric
data of the system revealed the presence of 19 periodic terms, of which eight
are likely g modes, nine are p modes, and the remaining two are combination
terms. It cannot be excluded that one or two low-frequency terms are rotational
frequencies. It is possible that both components of Beta Cen are Beta Cep/SPB
hybrids. An attempt to use the apparent changes of frequency to distinguish
which modes originate in which component did not succeed, but there is
potential for using this method when more BRITE data become available. Agena
seems to be one of very few rapidly rotating massive objects with rich p- and
g-mode spectra, and precisely known masses. It can therefore be used to gain a
better understanding of the excitation of pulsations in relatively rapidly
rotating stars and their seismic modeling. Finally, this case illustrates the
potential of BRITE-Constellation data for the detection of rich-frequency
spectra of small-amplitude modes in massive pulsating stars.

long been a promising source of gravitational waves for the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Mass segregation,
gravitational focusing, and multibody dynamical interactions naturally increase
the interaction rate between the most massive black holes in dense stellar
systems, eventually leading them to merge. We find that dynamical interactions,
particularly three-body binary formation, enhance the merger rate of black hole
binaries with total mass M_tot roughly as ~M_tot^beta, with beta >~ 4. We find
that this relation holds mostly independently of the initial mass function, but
the exact value depends on the degree of mass segregation. The detection rate
of such massive black hole binaries is only further enhanced by LIGO's greater
sensitivity to massive black hole binaries with M_tot <~ 80 solar masses. We
find that for power-law BH mass functions dN/dM ~ M^-alpha with alpha <~ 2,
LIGO is most likely to detect black hole binaries with a mass twice that of the
maximum initial black hole mass and a mass ratio near one. Repeated mergers of
black holes inside the cluster result in about ~5% of mergers being observed
between two and three times the maximum initial black hole mass. Using these
relations, one may be able to invert the observed distribution to the initial
mass function with multiple detections of merging black hole binaries.

exceptionally rich data-set: spectra and lightcurves in soft X-rays, UV,
optical, and radio. To understand its emission properties in all these bands,
we have extended our model for post-tidal disruption accretion and photon
production to estimate both soft X-ray radiation produced by the prompt
accretion phase and synchrotron emission associated with the bow shock driven
through an external medium by the unbound tidal debris, as well as optical and
UV light. We find that fiducial values of the stellar mass ($1 M_\odot$) and
black hole mass ($10^{6.5} M_{\odot}$) yield: quantitative agreement with the
optical/UV luminosity, lightcurve, and color temperature; approximate agreement
with the somewhat uncertain soft X-ray spectrum and lightcurve; and
quantitative agreement with the radio luminosity, spectrum and lightcurve.
Equipartition analysis of the radio data implies that the radio-emitting region
expands with a constant speed, and its magnitude is comparable to the speed
expected for the unbound stellar ejecta. Both facts provide strong support to
our model. We find that the disruption event took place in mid-September 2014.
Two independent parameters, the magnitude and logarithmic radial gradient of
the ambient gas density near the black hole, must be fit to the data to explain
the radio emission; their inferred values are comparable to those found near
both Sgr A* and the TDE candidate Swift J1644.

non-cohesion may be expressed by means of a geometric morphism $p :\mathcal{E}
\to \mathcal {S}$ (between toposes) with certain special properties that allow
to effectively use the intuition that the objects of $\mathcal{E}$ are `spaces'
and those of $\mathcal{S}$ are `sets'. Such geometric morphisms are called
(pre-)cohesive. We may also say that $\mathcal{E}$ is pre-cohesive (over
$\mathcal{S}$). In this case, the topos $\mathcal{E}$ determines an
$\mathcal{S}$-enriched `homotopy' category. The purpose of the present paper is
to study certain aspects of this homotopy theory. We introduce weakly Kan
objects in a pre-cohesive topos, which are analogous to Kan complexes in the
topos of simplicial sets. Also, given a geometric morphism $g:\mathcal{F}
\to\mathcal{E}$ between pre-cohesive toposes $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{E}$
(over the same base), we define what it means for $g$ to preserve pieces. We
prove that if $g$ preserves pieces then it induces an adjunction between the
homotopy categories determined by $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{E}$, and that the
direct image $g_*:\mathcal{F}\to \mathcal{E}$ preserves weakly Kan objects.
These and other results support the intuition that the inverse image of $g$ is
`geometric realization'. In particular, since Kan complexes are weakly Kan in
the pre-cohesive topos of simplicial sets, the result relating $g$ and weakly
Kan objects is analogous to the fact that the singular complex of a space is a
Kan complex.

between object and observer in relative motion we should be focusing on energy
difference rather than velocity difference. When different inertial observers
at different relative velocities measure the same rod (or clock), each observer
registers a different amount of kinetic energy for the object. Following the
consequences of this permits a new understanding of relativistic space

we could easily extend the deformed QRPA calculations to the less explored
region where lack of experimental data prevent effective parametrization of

performance of multi-input multi-output- orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems in providing high data rates for video
applications and may lead to decoding failure. In this paper, we propose a
light field (LF) video transmission system in wireless channels, and analyze
joint data detection and phase mitigation in MIMO-OFDM systems for LF video
transmission. The signal model and rate-distortion (RD) model for LF video
transmission in the presence of multiple PHNs are discussed. Moreover, we
propose an iterative algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter for joint
data detection and PHN tracking. Numerical results show that the proposed
detector can significantly improve the average bit-error rate (BER) and
peak-to-noise ratio (PSNR) performance for LF video transmission compared to
existing algorithms. Moreover, the BER and PSNR performance of the proposed
system is closer to that of the ideal case of perfect PHN estimation. Finally,
it is demonstrated that the proposed system model and algorithm are well suited
for LF video transmission in wireless channels.

Recent developments in the field have tried to improve the MSE by reducing its

interest in using other statistical moments than the mean, i.e. variance, in
the coarse-graining step of the MSE. Building on these trends, here we
introduce the so-called refined composite multiscale fuzzy entropy based on the

also investigate the complementarity of using the standard deviation instead of
the mean in the coarse-graining process using magnetoencephalograms in
Alzheimer disease and publicly available electroencephalograms recorded from
focal and non-focal areas in epilepsy. Our results indicate that RCMFE{\sigma}
offers complementary information to that revealed by classical coarse-graining

subject to cybersecurity threats. This paper studies the impact of integrity
attacks on real-time pricing (RTP), a key feature of smart grids that uses such
technologies to improve system efficiency. Recent studies have shown that RTP
creates a closed loop formed by the mutually dependent real-time price signals
and price-taking demand. Such a closed loop can be exploited by an adversary
whose objective is to destabilize the pricing system. Specifically, small
malicious modifications to the price signals can be iteratively amplified by
the closed loop, causing inefficiency and even severe failures such as
blackouts. This paper adopts a control-theoretic approach to deriving the
fundamental conditions of RTP stability under two broad classes of integrity
attacks, namely, the scaling and delay attacks. We show that the RTP system is
at risk of being destabilized only if the adversary can compromise the price
signals advertised to smart meters by reducing their values in the scaling
attack, or by providing old prices to over half of all consumers in the delay
attack. The results provide useful guidelines for system operators to analyze
the impact of various attack parameters on system stability, so that they may
take adequate measures to secure RTP systems.

process has a simple formulation (there are several equivalent formulations)
relative to a binary tree B (reassembling tree), with root node at the top and
$n$ leaf nodes at the bottom, where every cross-section corresponds to a
partition of V such that:
  - the bottom (or first) cross-section (all the leaves) is the finest
partition of V with n one-vertex blocks,
  - the top (or last) cross-section (the root) is the coarsest partition with a
single block, the entire set V,
  - a node (or block) in an intermediate cross-section (or partition) is the
result of merging its two children nodes (or blocks) in the cross-section (or
partition) below it.
  The maximum edge-boundary degree encountered during the reassembling process
is what we call the alpha-measure of the reassembling, and the sum of all
edge-boundary degrees is its beta-measure. The alpha-optimization (resp.
beta-optimization) of the reassembling of G is to determine a reassembling tree
B that minimizes its alpha-measure (resp. beta-measure).
  There are different forms of reassembling. In an earlier report, we studied
linear reassembling, which is the case when the height of B is (n-1). In this
report, we study balanced reassembling, when B has height [log n].
  The two main results in this report are the NP-hardness of alpha-optimization
and beta-optimization of balanced reassembling. The first result is obtained by
a sequence of polynomial-time reductions from minimum bisection of graphs
(known to be NP-hard), and the second by a sequence of polynomial-time

approximation is an order of magnitude better than its counterpart. To obtain
the analytical results, we use Stein's to show that a variant of the
Wasserstein distance between the normalized customer count distribution and our
approximation vanishes at a rate of $1/R$, where $R$ is the offered load to the
system. In contrast, the previous approximation only achieved a rate of $1/R$.
We hope our results motivate others to consider diffusion approximations with

particular factorization of the difference of two far field operators. Whilst
the factorization method been used so far mainly to identify the shape of a

operators can be used to compute bounds for numerical values of the medium on
the boundary of its support. To this end, we generalize ideas from
inside-outside duality to obtain a monotonicity principle that allows for
alternative uniqueness proofs for particular inverse scattering problems (e.g.,
when obstacles are present inside the medium). This monotonicity principle
indeed is our most important technical tool: It further directly shows that the
boundary values of the medium's contrast function are uniquely determined by
the corresponding far field operator. Our particular factorization of far field
operators additionally implies that the factorization method rigorously
characterizes the support of an inhomogeneous medium if the contrast function
takes merely positive or negative values on the boundary of its support,
independent of the contrast's values inside its support. Finally, the
monotonicity principle yields a simple algorithm to compute upper and lower
bounds for these boundary values, assuming the support of the contrast is
known. Numerical experiments show feasibility of a resulting numerical
algorithm.

for binary classification, assuming one class is surrounded by the other class
in very diverse radial directions, which is seen to be typical for our virus
detection data. This separation of the 2 classes in multiple radial directions
naturally motivates the development of Radial DWD. While classical machine
learning methods such as the Support Vector Machine and linear Distance
Weighted Discrimination can sometimes give reasonable answers for a given data
set, their generalizability is severely compromised because of the linear
separating boundary. Radial DWD addresses this challenge by using a more
appropriate (in this particular case) spherical separating boundary.
Simulations show that for appropriate radial contexts, this gives much better
generalizability than linear methods, and also much better than conventional
kernel based (nonlinear) Support Vector Machines, because the latter methods
essentially use much of the information in the data for determining the shape
of the separating boundary. The effectiveness of Radial DWD is demonstrated for
real virus detection.

industry standard techniques while being HV tolerant, making them good
candidates for drift-based, fast collecting, thus radiation-hard pixel
detectors. For the upgrade of the ATLAS Pixel Detector towards the HL-LHC
requirements, active pixel sensors in HV-CMOS technology were investigated.
These implement amplifier and discriminator stages directly in insulating deep
n-wells, which also act as collecting electrodes. The deep n-wells allow for
bias voltages up to 150V leading to a depletion depth of several 10um.
Prototype sensors in the ams H18 180nm and H35 350nm HV-CMOS processes have
been manufactured, acting as a potential drop-in replacement for the current
ATLAS Pixel sensors, thus leaving higher level processing such as trigger
handling to dedicated read-out chips.
  Sensors were thoroughly tested in lab measurements as well as in testbeam
experiments. Irradiation with X-rays and protons revealed a tolerance to
ionizing doses of 1Grad. An enlarged depletion zone of up to 100um thickness
after irradiation due to the acceptor removal effect was deduced from Edge-TCT
studies. The sensors showed high detection efficiencies after neutron
irradiation to 1e15 n_eq cm-2 in testbeam experiments.
  A full reticle size demonstrator chip, implemented in the H35 process is
being submitted to prove the large scale feasibility of the HV-CMOS concept.

important quantity for analyzing the convergence rate of first-order methods.
Specifically, we develop various calculus rules to deduce the KL exponent of
new (possibly nonconvex and nonsmooth) functions formed from functions with
known KL exponents. In addition, we show that the well-studied Luo-Tseng error
bound together with a mild assumption on the separation of stationary values
implies that the KL exponent is $\frac12$. The Luo-Tseng error bound is known
to hold for a large class of concrete structured optimization problems, and
thus we deduce the KL exponent of a large class of functions whose exponents
were previously unknown. Building upon this and the calculus rules, we are then
able to show that for many convex or nonconvex optimization models for
applications such as sparse recovery, their objective function's KL exponent is
$\frac12$. This includes the least squares problem with smoothly clipped
absolute deviation (SCAD) regularization or minimax concave penalty (MCP)
regularization and the logistic regression problem with $\ell_1$
regularization. Since many existing local convergence rate analysis for
first-order methods in the nonconvex scenario relies on the KL exponent, our
results enable us to obtain explicit convergence rate for various first-order
methods when they are applied to a large variety of practical optimization
models. Finally, we further illustrate how our results can be applied to
establishing local linear convergence of the proximal gradient algorithm and
the inertial proximal algorithm with constant step-sizes for some specific

the bulk of radioactive elements buried in the central layers of the debris,
there is a plume of 56Ni, with a significance of ~3 sigma, moving at high
velocity and receding from the observer. The mass of the plume is in the range
of ~ 0.03-0.08 solar masses. No SNIa explosion model had predicted the mass and

light peaks from \textsl{HST} imaging data reveal significant spatial
mass/light offsets as large as $1.72 \pm 0.24 \pm 0.34$ kpc in both filter
bands. Such large mass/light offsets, not seen in isolated field lens galaxies
and relaxed galaxy groups, may be related to the interactions between the two
lens galaxies. The detected mass/light offsets can potentially serve as an
important test for the self-interacting dark matter model. However, other
mechanisms such as dynamical friction on spatially differently distributed dark
matter and stars could produce similar offsets. Detailed hydrodynamical
simulations of galaxy-galaxy interactions with self-interacting dark matter
could accurately quantify the effects of different mechanisms. The background
LAE is found to contain three distinct star-forming knots with characteristic
sizes from 116 pc to 438 pc. It highlights the power of strong gravitational
lensing in probing the otherwise too faint and unresolved structures of
distance objects below subkiloparsec or even 100 pc scales through its
magnification effect.

intrinsic stellar color excesses from the stellar effective temperatures and
use them to determine the mid-infrared extinction for a given line of sight.
For the entire sky of the Milky Way surveyed by APOGEE, we derive the

for the first time, the AKARI/S9W band at 8.23$\mu$m. Our results agree with
previous works in that the extinction curve is flat in the ~3--8$\mu$m
wavelength range and is generally consistent with the $R_V=5.5$ model curve
except our determination exceeds the model prediction in the WISE/W4 band.
Although some previous works found that the mid-IR extinction law appears to
vary with the extinction depth $A_{\rm{K_S}}$, no noticeable variation has been
found in this work. The uncertainties are analyzed in terms of the bootstrap
resampling method and Monte-Carlo simulation and are found to be rather small.

detect V/R variation of H$\alpha$ spectral line during the observed period. We

unbalanced use of data can bias estimates, which we resolve by ensuring that
each data sample contributes exactly once to centroids. The second is in
choosing mini-batch sizes, which we address by balancing premature fine-tuning
of centroids with redundancy induced slow-down. Experiments show that the

direction of its stationary heat flows it may function as e.g. a refrigerator
or a heat transformer. These continuous heat devices can be arbitrarily complex
multipartite systems, and yet their working principle is always the same: They
are made up of several elementary three-level stages operating in parallel. As
a result, it is possible to devise external black-box testing strategies to
learn about their functionality and performance regardless of any internal

two-level spin to one of its contact transitions. The steady state of this
external probe contains information about the presence of heat leaks and
internal dissipation in the device, and also, about the direction of its
steady-state heat currents. Provided that the irreversibility of the heat pump
is low, one can further estimate its coefficient of performance. These
techniques may find applications in the emerging field of quantum thermal
engineering, as they facilitate the diagnosis and design optimization of

reduced by taking advantage of the crystal symmetry of the lattice.

q\lesssim 0.59$, while the separation of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ pure hexagonal phases
minimizes the energy for $0.59\lesssim q<1$. Here, we introduce a novel
structure which consists in the separation of two phases, the pure hexagonal
one formed by a fraction of particles with the larger charge $Q_1$ and the
other fixed one containing different numbers of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ charges. Using
an analytic method based on an expansion of the interaction energy in Misra

(SN~Ia) SN 2011fe in M101. Our data, starting from $\sim16$ days before maximum
light and extending to $\sim463$ days after maximum, provide an unprecedented
time series of spectra and photometry for a normal SN~Ia. Fitting the
early-time rising light curve, we find that the luminosity evolution of SN
2011fe follows a $t^n$ law, with the index $n$ being close to 2.0 in the $VRI$
bands but slightly larger in the $U$ and $B$ bands. Combining the published
ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) photometry, we derive the contribution
of UV/NIR emission relative to the optical. SN 2011fe is found to have stronger
UV emission and reaches its UV peak a few days earlier than other SNe~Ia with
similar $\Delta m_{15}(B)$, suggestive of less trapping of high-energy photons
in the ejecta. Moreover, the $U$-band light curve shows a notably faster
decline at late phases ($t\approx 100$--300 days), which also suggests that the
ejecta may be relatively transparent to UV photons. These results favor the
notion that SN 2011fe might have a progenitor system with relatively lower
metallicity. On the other hand, the early-phase spectra exhibit prominent
high-velocity features (HVFs) of O~I $\lambda$7773 and the Ca~II~NIR triplet,
but only barely detectable in Si~II~6355. This difference can be caused either
by an ionization/temperature effect or an abundance enhancement scenario for
the formation of HVFs; it suggests that the photospheric temperature of SN
2011fe is intrinsically low, perhaps owing to incomplete burning during the
explosion of the white dwarf.

According to the statistical interpretation a wave function describes only an
ensemble of identically prepared physical systems. Searching for an intuitive
explanation of long range correlations between outcomes of distant
measurements, performed on pairs of physical systems prepared in a spin singlet
state, John Bell analysed local realistic hidden variable models and proved
that correlations consistent with these models satisfy Bell inequalities which
are violated by some predictions of quantum mechanics. Several different local
models were constructed, various inequalities proven and shown to be violated
by experimental data. Some physicists concluded that Nature is definitely not
local. We strongly disagree with this conclusion and we critically analyze some
influential finite sample proofs of various inequalities and so called quantum
Randi challenges. We also show how one can win so called Bell game.The
violation of inequalities does not prove that local and causal explanation of
correlations is impossible. The violation of inequalities gives only a strong
argument against counterfactual definiteness and against a point of view
according to which experimental outcomes are produced in irreducible random
way. We also explain the meaning of sample homogeneity loophole and show how it
can invalidate statistical significance tests. We point out that this loophole
was not closed in several recent experiments testing local realism.

matter power spectrum, but there is evidence for a bias in the photometric
redshifts in the CFHTLenS data, consistent with a completely independent
analysis by Choi et al. (2015), based on spectroscopic redshifts; and that

functions of the molecule. This work is focused on the investigation the
features of the 3$d$-shell electronic states of the iron ion located inside the

the changes in these states occurring during the oxidation process. We use a
combination of the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method and the Dynamical
Mean Field Theory (DMFT) approach. This method allows to consider dynamic
correlation effects that are important in the description of systems containing

quantum state. This state is a mixture of several electronic states with
comparable statistical probability. Furthermore, it was found that the process
of the bond formation between the iron-porphyrin complex and the oxygen
molecule is more complex than a simple high-spin to low-spin state of the Fe
ion transition. The transition metal ion oxidation is accompanied by
substantial redistribution of the states probabilities and the increasing of
the entanglement degree. This process also leads to the reduction of the total

with intriguing properties. So far, the recent upsurge of studies has mostly
focused on the spontaneous behavior of these systems --in the absence of
external constraints or driving--. Yet, many real life systems evolve under
constraints, being both submitted to flow and various taxis. In the present
work, we demonstrate a new experimental system which opens up the way for
quantitative investigations, and discriminating examinations, of the
challenging theoretical description of such systems. We explore the behavior of
magnetotactic bacteria as a particularly rich and versatile class of driven
matter, which behavior can be studied under contrasting and contradicting
stimuli. In particular we demonstrate that the competing driving of an
orienting magnetic field and hydrodynamic flow lead not only to jetting, but
also unveils a new pearling instability. This illustrates new structuring
capabilities of driven active matter.

Using an information-theoretic model, we show that a receptor array is optimal
for this task if it achieves two possibly conflicting goals: (i) each receptor
should respond to half of all odors and (ii) the response of different
receptors should be uncorrelated when averaged over odors presented with
natural statistics. We use these design principles to predict statistics of the

resolve concentrations well or distinguish mixtures reliably. Finally, we use
our results to predict properties of experimentally measured receptor arrays.

give rise to spectra with narrow lines at all times. We find that a standard
~10Msun 10^51erg SN ejecta ramming into a 0.4Msun dense CSM is inadequate for
SN1994W, as it leads to the appearance of broad lines at late times. This
structure, however, generates spectra that exhibit the key morphological
changes seen in SN1998S. For SN1994W, we consider a completely different
configuration, which involves the interaction at a large radius of a low mass
inner shell with a high mass outer shell. Such a structure may arise in an
8-12Msun star from a nuclear flash (e.g., of Ne) followed within a few years by
core collapse. Our simulations show that the large mass of the outer shell
leads to the complete braking of the inner shell material, the formation of a
slow dense shell, and the powering of a luminous SN IIn, even for a low inner
shell energy. Early on, our model line profiles are typical of SNe IIn,
exhibiting narrow cores and broad electron-scattering wings. As observed in
SN1994W, they also remain narrow at late times. Our SN1994W model invokes two
low energy ejections, both atypical of observed massive stars, and illustrates
the diversity of configurations leading to SNe IIn. These results also
highlight the importance of spectra to constrain the dynamical properties and
understand the origin of SNe IIn.

production.Calculations for a 320 MW windfarm connected to shore via a 200 km
cable at 220 kV nominal voltage shows that an annual loss reduction of 9
percent is achievable by simply using a 15 percent tap changer voltage

supersonic stellar wind. Part of the emitted X-rays is subsequently absorbed in
the wind and influences its ionization state. Because hot star winds are driven
radiatively, the modified ionization equilibrium affects the radiative force.
We review the recent progress in modelling the influence of X-rays on the
radiative equilibrium and on the radiative force. We focus particularly on
single stars with X-rays produced in wind shocks and on binaries with massive
components, which belong to the most luminous objects in X-rays.

becomes one of the central themes of research. In traditional approaches, the
controller, by its internal functionality, finds appropriate actions on the
basis of the history of sensor values, guided by the goals, intentions,
objectives, learning schemes, and so on planted into it. The idea is that the
controller controls the world---the body plus its environment---as reliably as
possible. However, in elastically actuated robots this approach faces severe
difficulties. This paper advocates for a new paradigm of self-organized
control. The paper presents a solution with a controller that is devoid of any
functionalities of its own, given by a fixed, explicit and context-free
function of the recent history of the sensor values. When applying this
controller to a muscle-tendon driven arm-shoulder system from the Myorobotics
toolkit, we observe a vast variety of self-organized behavior patterns: when
left alone, the arm realizes pseudo-random sequences of different poses but one
can also manipulate the system into definite motion patterns. But most
interestingly, after attaching an object, the controller gets in a functional
resonance with the object's internal dynamics: when given a half-filled bottle,
the system spontaneously starts shaking the bottle so that maximum response
from the dynamics of the water is being generated. After attaching a pendulum
to the arm, the controller drives the pendulum into a circular mode. In this
way, the robot discovers dynamical affordances of objects its body is
interacting with. We also discuss perspectives for using this controller
paradigm for intention driven behavior generation.

  This paper presents a deterministic and local constant factor approximation
for minimum dominating sets on bounded genus graphs, a very large family of

modified, first-order definable variant of an existing algorithm by Lenzen et

not rely on any topological arguments. We believe that our techniques can be

them as graphical models. Their layout, solely determined by the modeler,
affects their understandability. To support the construction of understandable
models it would be beneficial to systematically study this effect. However,
this requires a basic set of measurable key visual features, depicting the
layout properties that are meaningful to the human user. The aim of this
research is thus twofold. First, to empirically identify key visual features of
business process models which are perceived as meaningful to the user. Second,
to show how such features can be quantified into computational metrics, which
are applicable to business process models. We focus on one particular feature,
consistency of flow direction, and show the challenges that arise when
transforming it into a precise metric. We propose three different metrics
addressing these challenges, each following a different view of flow
consistency. We then report the results of an empirical evaluation, which
indicates which metric is more effective in predicting the human perception of
this feature. Moreover, two other automatic evaluations describing the
performance and the computational capabilities of our metrics are reported as
well.

edge-localised modes (ELMs), can potentially damage divertor materials and
release impurities into the main plasma, limiting plasma performance. The most
difficult to handle are type I ELMs since they carry the largest fraction of
energy from the plasma and therefore deposit the largest heat flux at the
target and on first wall materials. Knowing the temperature of the ions
released from ELM events is important since it determines the potential
sputtering they would cause from plasma facing materials. To make measurements
of Ti by retarding field energy analyser (RFEA) during type I ELMs a new
operational technique has been used to allow faster measurements to be made;
this is called the fast swept technique (FST).

obscuration and optical-UV-X-ray continuum in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548. In
2013 and 2014, the Swift observatory monitored NGC 5548 on average every day or
two, with archival observations reaching back to 2005, totalling about 670 ks
of observing time. Both broadband spectral modelling and temporal rms
variability analysis are applied to the Swift data. We disentangle the
variability caused by absorption, due to an obscuring weakly-ionised outflow
near the disk, from variability of the intrinsic continuum components (the soft
X-ray excess and the power-law) originating from the disk and its associated
coronae. The spectral model that we apply to this extensive Swift data is the
global model that we derived for NGC 5548 from analysis of the stacked spectra
from our multi-satellite campaign of summer 2013 (including XMM-Newton, NuSTAR
and HST). The results of our Swift study show that changes in the covering
fraction of the obscurer is the primary and dominant cause of variability in
the soft X-ray band on timescales of 10 days to ~ 5 months. The obscuring
covering fraction of the X-ray source is found to range between 0.7 and nearly
1.0. The contribution of the soft excess component to the X-ray variability is
often much less than that of the obscurer, but it becomes comparable when the
optical-UV continuum flares up. We find that the soft excess is consistent with
being the high-energy tail of the optical-UV continuum and can be explained by
warm Comptonisation: up-scattering of the disk seed photons in a warm,
optically thick corona as part of the inner disk. To this date, the Swift
monitoring of NGC 5548 shows that the obscurer has been continuously present in
our line of sight for at least 4 years (since at least February 2012).

test set of $u$ unlabeled samples, with the goal of best labeling that
particular test set. Conversely, inductive learning considers a training set of
$m$ labeled samples drawn iid from $P(X,Y)$, with the goal of best labeling any
future samples drawn iid from $P(X)$. This comparison suggests that
transduction is a much easier type of inference than induction, but is this
really the case? This paper provides a negative answer to this question, by
proving the first known minimax lower bounds for transductive, realizable,
binary classification. Our lower bounds show that $m$ should be at least
$\Omega(d/\epsilon + \log(1/\delta)/\epsilon)$ when $\epsilon$-learning a
concept class $\mathcal{H}$ of finite VC-dimension $d<\infty$ with confidence
$1-\delta$, for all $m \leq u$. This result draws three important conclusions.
First, general transduction is as hard as general induction, since both
problems have $\Omega(d/m)$ minimax values. Second, the use of unlabeled data
does not help general transduction, since supervised learning algorithms such
as ERM and (Hanneke, 2015) match our transductive lower bounds while ignoring
the unlabeled test set. Third, our transductive lower bounds imply lower bounds
for semi-supervised learning, which add to the important discussion about the
role of unlabeled data in machine learning.

strategic timing and pointing information. We explore how these in turn deliver

reported by the IceCube collaboration. Some features of the energy and
declination distributions of IceCube events hint at a North/South asymmetry of
the neutrino flux. This could be due to the presence of the bulk of our Galaxy
in the Southern hemisphere. The ANTARES neutrino telescope, located in the
Mediterranean Sea, has been taking data since 2007. It offers the best
sensitivity to muon neutrinos produced by galactic cosmic ray interactions in
this region of the sky. In this letter a search for an extended neutrino flux
from the Galactic Ridge region is presented. Different models of neutrino
production by cosmic ray propagation are tested. No excess of events is
observed and upper limits for different neutrino flux spectral indices are set.
This constrains the number of IceCube events possibly originating from the
Galactic Ridge. A simple power-law extrapolation of the Fermi-LAT flux to
associated IceCube High Energy Starting Events is excluded at 90% confidence

particles. Hydrodynamical studies show that small particles generally avoid
collisions with the planetesimals because they are entrained by the flow around
them. This occurs when $St$, the Stokes number, defined as the ratio of the
dust stopping time to the planetesimal crossing time, becomes much smaller than
unity. However, these studies have been limited to the laminar case, whereas
these disks are believed to be turbulent. We want to estimate the influence of
gas turbulence on the dust-planetesimal collision rate and on the impact
speeds. We used three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of a fixed
sphere (planetesimal) facing a laminar and turbulent flow seeded with small
inertial particles (dust) subject to a Stokes drag. A no-slip boundary
condition on the planetesimal surface is modeled via a penalty method. We find
that turbulence can significantly increase the collision rate of dust particles
with planetesimals. For a high turbulence case (when the amplitude of turbulent
fluctuations is similar to the headwind velocity), we find that the collision
probability remains equal to the geometrical rate or even higher for $St\geq
0.1$, i.e., for dust sizes an order of magnitude smaller than in the laminar
case. We derive expressions to calculate impact probabilities as a function of
dust and planetesimal size and turbulent intensity.

we show that not only a magnetic field, but also a second order electric field
is produced in the vicinity of a current carrying conductor, which is
consistent with Maxwell's theory. This electric field points radially toward
the current carrying conductor as detected in Edwards' experiments. We also
show that the positive field, detected by Sansbury in a U-shaped copper

mechanism providing an effective collisionality for the plasma. We use
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to study the interplay between electron and
ion-scale velocity-space instabilities and their effect on electron pressure
anisotropy, viscous heating, and thermal conduction. The adiabatic invariance
of the magnetic moment in low-collisionality plasmas leads to pressure
anisotropy, $p_{\perp,j} > p_{||,j}$, if the magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is
amplified ($p_{\perp,j}$ and $p_{||,j}$ denote the pressure of species $j$
[electron, ion] perpendicular and parallel to $\vec{B}$). If the resulting
anisotropy is large enough, it can in turn trigger small-scale plasma
instabilities. Our PIC simulations explore the nonlinear regime of the mirror,
ion-cyclotron, and electron whistler instabilities, through continuous
amplification of the magnetic field $|\vec{B}|$ by an imposed shear in the
plasma. In the regime $1 \lesssim \beta_j \lesssim 20$ ($\beta_j \equiv 8\pi
p_j/|\vec{B}|^2$), the saturated electron pressure anisotropy, $\Delta
p_e/p_{||,e}$, is determined mainly by the (electron-lengthscale) whistler
marginal stability condition, with a modest factor of $\sim 1.5-2$ decrease due
to the trapping of electrons by the mirrors. We explicitly calculate the mean
free path of the electrons and ions along the mean magnetic field and provide a
simple physical prescription for the mean free path and thermal conductivity in
low-collisionality $\beta_j \gtrsim 1$ plasmas. Our results imply that
velocity-space instabilities likely decrease the thermal conductivity of plasma
in the outer parts of massive, hot, galaxy clusters. We also discuss the
implications of our results for electron heating and thermal conduction in
low-collisionality accretion flows onto black holes, including Sgr A* in the
Galactic Center.

free massless particles it is possible to construct an explicit boson theory
which is exactly equivalent in terms of momenta and energy to a fermion theory.
The fermions come as $2^{d/2-1}$ families and the to this whole system of
fermions corresponding bosons come as a whole series of the Kalb-Ramond fields,
one set of components for each number of indexes on the tensor fields.
  Since Kalb-Ramond fields naturally (only) couple to the extended objects or
branes, we suspect that inclusion of interaction into such for a bosonization
prepared system - except for the lowest dimensions - without including branes
or something like that is not likely to be possible.
  The need for the families is easily seen just by using the theorem long ago
put forward by Aratyn and one of us (H.B.F.N.), which says that to have the
statistical mechanics of the fermion system and the boson system to match one
needs to have the number of the field components in the ratio
$\frac{2^{d-1}-1}{2^{d-1}}= \frac{\# bosons}{\# fermions}$, enforcing that the
number of fermion components must be a multiple of $2^{d-1}$, where $d$ is the
space-time dimension. This ""explanation"" of the number of dimension is
potentially useful for the explanation for the number of dimension put forward
by one of us (S.N.M.B.) since long in the spin-charge-family theory, and leads
like the latter to typically (a multiple of) $4$ families.
  And this is the second purpose for our work on the fermionization in an
arbitrary number of dimensions - namely to learn how ""natural"" is the inclusion
of the families in the way the spin-charge-family theory does.

of Dirichlet series are equivalent to boundedness of a class of composition
operators. Following this, we perform a careful study of such composition
operators generated by polynomial symbols $\varphi$ on a scale of Bergman--type
Hilbert spaces $\mathcal{D}_\alpha$. We investigate the optimal $\beta$ such
that the composition operator $\mathcal{C}_\varphi$ maps $\mathcal{D}_\alpha$
boundedly into $\mathcal{D}_\beta$. We also prove a new embedding theorem for
the non-Hilbertian Hardy space $\mathcal H^p$ into a Bergman space in the
half-plane and use it to consider composition operators generated by polynomial
symbols on $\mathcal{H}^p$, finding the first non-trivial results of this type.
The embedding also yields a new result for the functional associated to the
multiplicative Hilbert matrix.

with an additional assumption that neutrinos might exist in tachyonic almost
sterile states. To this end, we propose a group-theoretical algorithm for the
description of tachyons. The key point is that we employ a distinct tachyon
Lorentz group with new (superluminal) parametrization which does not lead to
violation of causality and unitarity. Our dark matter model represents
effectively scalar tachyonic neutrino-antineutrino conglomerate. Distributed
all over the universe, such fluid behaves as stable isothermal/stiff medium
which produces somewhat denser regions (`halos') around galaxies and clusters.
To avoid the central singularity inherent to the isothermal profile, we apply a
special smoothing algorithm which yields density distributions and rotation
curves consistent with observational data.

bundles or wave packets, the radiation from a single state transition is at
most a single continuous wave train that starts and ends with the transition.
The radiation equilibrium spectrum must be the superposition sum of the spectra
of such wave trains. A classical equipartition of wave trains cannot diverge
since they would be finite in number, whereas standing wave modes are by
definition infinite, which had doomed Rayleigh's theory, and concern only the
total radiation. Wave trains are the microscopic entities of radiation
interacting with matter, that correspond to molecules in kinetic theory. Their
quantization came from matter transitions in Einstein's 1917 derivation of
Planck's law. The spectral scatter of wave trains by Doppler shifts, which
cause the wavelength displacements in Wien's law used for the frequency
dependence in Einstein's derivation, is shown to yield the shape of the Planck
spectrum. A Lorentz transform property of Doppler shifts discovered by Einstein
is further shown equivalently necessary and sufficient to have corrected
Rayleigh's theory.

within this framework. The graph-theoretic notion of eccentricity suggests that
when working in a harmonic scheme dictated by any common musical scale, no
triad is any more isolated than any other. Complex network theory refines this
idea, and in this context provides measures of how important particular triads
might be for the flow of chord progressions through the harmonic network. We
review and compare several different such measures of centrality and
communicability.

system (say, a gas in a box) at time $t_0$ in a given macro-state of
less-than-maximal entropy typically evolve in such a way that the entropy at
time $t$ increases with $|t-t_0|$ in both time directions. In order to account
for the observed entropy increase in only one time direction, the thermodynamic
arrow of time, one usually appeals to the hypothesis that the initial state of
the universe was one of very low entropy. In certain recent models of
cosmology, however, no hypothesis about the initial state of the universe is
invoked. We discuss how the emergence of a thermodynamic arrow of time in such
models can nevertheless be compatible with the above-mentioned consequence of
statistical mechanics, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding.
