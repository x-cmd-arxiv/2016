provides an elegant classification in which the majority of theorems of
ordinary mathematics fall into only five categories, based on the 'Big Five'
logical systems. Recently, a lot of effort has been directed towards finding
exceptional theorems, i.e. which fall outside the Big Five. The so-called
Reverse Mathematics zoo is a collection of such exceptional theorems (and their
relations). It was shown in [17] that a number of uniform versions of the
zoo-theorems, i.e. where a functional computes the objects stated to exist,
fall in the third Big Five category arithmetical comprehension, inside
Kohlenbach's higher-order Reverse Mathematics. In this paper, we extend and
refine the results from [17]. In particular, we establish analogous results for
recent additions to the Reverse Mathematics zoo, thus establishing that the
latter disappear at the uniform level. Furthermore, we show that the
aforementioned equivalences can be proved using only intuitionistic logic.
Perhaps most surprisingly, these explicit equivalences are extracted from
nonstandard equivalences in Nelson's internal set theory, and we show that the
nonstandard equivalence can be recovered from the explicit ones.

distribution. This density distribution of the entire cloud complex is then
recursively reconstructed based on available continuum maps, including both

well fitted by applying a superposition of spherical cores with Plummer-like

position Sgr B2(N) along the line of sight behind the plane containing Sgr

quiescent levels but stalled at a (slowly decaying) meta-stable state with
luminosities ~10 times that observed in quiescence. The spectra in these states
are considerably softer than the outburst spectra and appear to soften in time
when the luminosity decreases. The physical mechanism behind these meta-stable
states is unclear and they could be due to low-level accretion (either directly
onto the neutron stars or onto their magnetospheres) or due to cooling of the
accretion-heated neutron star crusts. Based on the spectra, the slowly
decreasing luminosities, and the spectral softening, we favour the crust
cooling hypothesis but we cannot exclude the accretion scenarios. On top of
this meta-stable state, weak accretion events were observed that occurred at
periastron passage and may thus be related to regular type-I outbursts.

of lattice vibrations, namely, Localized Anharmonic Vibrations (LAV) can be
excited either thermally or by external triggering, in which the amplitude of
atomic oscillations greatly exceeds that of harmonic oscillations (phonons)
that determine the system temperature. Coherency and persistence of LAV may
have drastic effect on chemical and nuclear reaction rates due to time-periodic
modulation of reaction sites. One example is a strong acceleration of chemical
reaction rates driven by thermally-activated ""jumps"" over the reaction barrier
due to the time-periodic modulation of the barrier height in the LAV vicinity.
At sufficiently low temperatures, the reaction rate is controlled by quantum
tunneling through the barrier rather than by classical jumping over it. A giant
increase of sub-barrier transparency was demonstrated for a parabolic potential
well with the time-periodic eigenfrequency, when the modulation frequency
exceeds the eigenfrequency by a factor of ~2 (parametric regime). Such regime
can be realized for a hydrogen or deuterium atom in metal hydrides/deuterides,
such as NiH or PdD, in the vicinity of LAV. We present an analytical solution
of the Schrodinger equation for a nonstationary harmonic oscillator, analyze
the parametric regime in details and discuss its applications to the tunnel
effect and to D-D fusion in PdD lattice. We obtain simple analytical
expressions for the increase of amplitude and energy of zero-point oscillations
(ZPO) induced by the parametric modulation. Based on that, we demonstrate a
drastic increase of the D-D fusion rate with in-creasing number of modulation
periods evaluated in the framework of Schwinger model, which takes into account
suppression of the Coulomb barrier due to lattice vibrations.

~13 - 500 during the last ~230 years. A second scenario to explain the
morphology of the line-emitting areas in the nuclear region of NGC 3621
involves no decrease of the AGN bolometric luminosity and establishes that the
AGN is highly obscured toward the observer but not toward the line-emitting
blob. The third scenario proposed here assumes that the off-centered
line-emitting blob is a recoiling supermassive black hole, after the
coalescence of two black holes. Finally, an additional hypothesis is that the
central X-ray source is not an AGN, but an X-ray binary. This idea is
consistent with all the scenarios we proposed.

multisymplectic framework for Lagrangian field theory over discrete spacetime.
One family of examples is composed by Noether currents. A much larger family of
examples is composed by currents, spacetime local objects, that encode the
symplectic product between two arbitrary vectors tangent to the space of
solutions. A weak version of observable currents, which in general are
nonlocal, is also introduced. Weak observable currents can be used to separate
points in the space of physically distinct solutions. It is shown that a large
class of weak observable currents can be ""improved"" to become local. A Poisson
bracket gives the space of observable currents the structure of a Lie algebra.
Peierls bracket for bulk observables gives an algebra homomorphism mapping
equivalence classes of bulk observables to weak observable currents. The study

investigating hydrodynamic behavior of systems with non-negligible equilibrium

relatively large integration time steps, which is an important feature for
simulations on large temporal scales. In practice, however, an increase in the
integration time step leads to increasingly larger systematic errors in the
sampling statistics. Here, we demonstrate that the prime origin of these

coordinates of the particles. This lead to an ambiguity in the interpretation
of the stochastic differential Langevin equation, known as the

  model",,,,,"q-bio.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ribosomal density along the coding region of the mRNA molecule affect
various fundamental intracellular phenomena including: protein production
rates, organismal fitness, ribosomal drop off, and co-translational protein
folding. Thus, regulating translation in order to obtain a desired ribosomal
profile along the mRNA molecule is an important biological problem. We study
this problem using a model for mRNA translation, called the ribosome flow model
(RFM). In the RFM, the mRNA molecule is modeled as chain of n sites. The n
state-variables describe the ribosomal density profile along the mRNA molecule,
whereas the transition rates from each site to the next are controlled by n+1
positive constants. To study the problem of controlling the density profile, we
consider some or all of the transition rates as time-varying controls. We
consider the following problem: given an initial and a desired ribosomal
density profile, determine the time-varying values of the transition rates that
steer the RFM to this density profile, if they exist. Specifically, we consider
two control problems. In the first, all transition rates can be regulated and
the goal is to steer the ribosomal density profile and the protein production
rate from a given initial value to a desired value. In the second, a single
transition rate is controlled and the goal is to steer the production rate to a
desired value. In the first case, we show that the system is controllable, i.e.
the control is powerful enough to steer the RFM to any desired value, and we
provide closed-form expressions for constant control functions (or transition
rates) asymptotically steering the RFM to the desired value. For the second
problem, we show that the production rate can be steered to any desired value
in a feasible region determined by the other, constant transition rates. We
discuss some of the biological implications of these results.

Continuous-pole expansion (CPE), a recently proposed analytic continuation
method, has been incorporated and compared to the widely used Pade
approximation. Full crystal symmetry has been employed for computational
speedup. We have applied our approach to 18 well-studied
semiconductors/insulators that cover a wide range of band gaps computed at the
levels of single-shot G0W0, partially self-consistent GW0, and fully
self-consistent GW (scGW). Our calculations show that G0W0 leads to band gaps
that agree well with experiment for the case of simple s-p electron systems,
whereas scGW is required for improving the band gaps in 3-d electron systems.
In addition, GW0 almost always predicts larger band gap values compared to
scGW, likely due to the substantial underestimation of screening effects. Both
the CPE method and Pade approximation lead to similar band gaps for most
systems except strontium titantate, suggesting further investigation into the
latter approximation is necessary for strongly correlated systems. Our computed
band gaps serve as important benchmarks for the accuracy of the Matsubara-time

between these structures provide extra information that can be leveraged for
studying the dataset using the graph. Based on this observation, we generalize
Diffusion Maps (DM) in manifold learning and introduce the framework of
Horizontal Diffusion Maps (HDM). We model a dataset with pairwise structural
correspondences as a fibre bundle equipped with a connection. We demonstrate
the advantage of incorporating such additional information and study the
asymptotic behavior of HDM on general fibre bundles. In a broader context, HDM
reveals the sub-Riemannian structure of high-dimensional datasets, and provides
a nonparametric learning framework for datasets with structural
correspondences.

Much of this is in text
form, insurmountable in scope for humans and incomprehensible in structure for
computers. Text mining is an expanding field of research that seeks to utilize
the information contained in vast document collections. General data mining
methods based on machine learning face challenges with the scale of text data,
posing a need for scalable text mining methods.
  This thesis proposes a solution to scalable text mining: generative models
combined with sparse computation. A unifying formalization for generative text
models is defined, bringing together research traditions that have used
formally equivalent models, but ignored parallel developments. This framework
allows the use of methods developed in different processing tasks such as
retrieval and classification, yielding effective solutions across different
text mining tasks. Sparse computation using inverted indices is proposed for
inference on probabilistic models. This reduces the computational complexity of
the common text mining operations according to sparsity, yielding probabilistic
models with the scalability of modern search engines.
  The proposed combination provides sparse generative models: a solution for
text mining that is general, effective, and scalable. Extensive experimentation
on text classification and ranked retrieval datasets are conducted, showing
that the proposed solution matches or outperforms the leading task-specific
methods in effectiveness, with a order of magnitude decrease in classification
times for Wikipedia article categorization with a million classes. The
developed methods were further applied in two 2014 Kaggle data mining prize
competitions with over a hundred competing teams, earning first and second
places.

noise measurements made on a pseudo-thermal state of light using balanced
detection. A full theory describing the measurement is developed, and in
agreement with theory it is found that the shot noise variance in the balanced
signal reproduces the time series of the flux of the primary incoherent beam.
Moreover, when the average power of the pseudo-thermal light is varied, the
balanced detection is seen to track this change. A comparison of direct
detection and balanced detection of the thermal field, shows that the balanced
detection performs at least as well the direct detection and under some
conditions appears to outperform the direct detection. There is not necessarily
a contradiction with quantum field theory which predicts that at best the
performance of the balanced detection should be equal to the direct detection,
because the direct detection process is subject to nonlinearity that has not
been excluded by measurements (even though any tests we performed suggest such
effects are small). This is the first time that the bunching noise effect of
high occupation number chaotic light via the shot noise of the field has
successfully been measured, to the point of using it to infer the flux of the
field. The findings may be relevant to radio receiver design, specifically from
the viewpoint of sensitivity improvement.

quantitatively changes the dispersion relation of the fundamental waveguide

The frequency position and the width of the band gap are dependent on the

position of the band gap is shifted from the resonance absorption frequency of
the metasurface. In such a case, the magnetic metasurface inside a waveguide

small, and most of the electromagnetic energy inside the non-propagation band

$H_1 , \ldots, H_n$, so that $H_{i+1}$ is tested only if $H_1 , \ldots, H_i$

familywise error rate under arbitrary dependence by the basic procedure which
tests each hypothesis at level $\alpha$, and no other multiplicity adjustment
is needed. However, we show that this is far too liberal if one also accounts
for directional errors. But, by imposing certain dependence assumptions on the
test statistics, one can retain the basic procedure. Through a simulation study
and a clinical trial example, we numerically illustrate good performance of the
proposed procedures compared to the existing mdFWER controlling procedures. The

information on the Inter Galactic Medium (IGM) from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch
of Reionization (EoR). While the power spectrum is a useful tool to
statistically investigate the 21cm signal, the 21cm brightness temperature
field is highly non-Gaussian, and the power spectrum is inadequate to
characterize the non-Gaussianity. The Minkowski Functionals (MFs) are promising
tools to extract non-gaussian features of the 21cm signal and give topological
information such as morphology of ionized bubbles. In this work, we study the
21cm line signal in detail with MFs. To promote understanding of basic features
of the 21cm signal, we calculate the MFs of not only the hydrogen neutral
fraction but the matter density and spin temperature, which contribute to the
brightness temperature fluctuations. We find that the structure of the
brightness temperature depends mainly on the ionized fraction and the spin
temperature at late and early stages of the EoR, respectively. Further, we
investigate the redshift evolution of the MFs at $7 < z < 20$. Then, we find
that, after the onset of reionization, the MFs reflect mainly the ionized
bubble property. In addition, the MFs are sensitive to model parameters which
are related to the topology of ionized bubbles and we consider the possibility
of constraining the parameters by the future 21cm signal observations.

Here we report on the hexagonal phase stabilization, magnetism, and

First, our first-principles calculations show that the hexagonal structure can

robustly unaffected. Therefore, Lu$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$FeO$_3$ can act as a platform

demonstrate a magnetic anomaly (probable antiferromagnetic ordering) above room

text categorization (Johnson & Zhang, 2015). We view it as a special case of a
general framework which jointly trains a linear model with a non-linear feature
generator consisting of `text region embedding + pooling'. Under this
framework, we explore a more sophisticated region embedding method using Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM). LSTM can embed text regions of variable (and possibly
large) sizes, whereas the region size needs to be fixed in a CNN. We seek
effective and efficient use of LSTM for this purpose in the supervised and
semi-supervised settings. The best results were obtained by combining region
embeddings in the form of LSTM and convolution layers trained on unlabeled
data. The results indicate that on this task, embeddings of text regions, which
can convey complex concepts, are more useful than embeddings of single words in
isolation. We report performances exceeding the previous best results on four
benchmark datasets.

parametric framework to describe the spacetime of axisymmetric black holes in

functions of both the radial and the polar angular coordinates, forcing a
double expansion to obtain a generic axisymmetric metric expression. In
particular, we use a continued-fraction expansion in terms of a compactified
radial coordinate to express the radial dependence, while we exploit a Taylor
expansion in terms of the cosine of the polar angle for the polar dependence.
These choices lead to a superior convergence in the radial direction and to an
exact limit on the equatorial plane. As a validation of our approach, we build
parametrized representations of Kerr, rotating dilaton, and
Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet black holes. The match is already very good at
lowest order in the expansion and improves as new orders are added. We expect a
similar behavior for any stationary and axisymmetric black-hole metric.

a channel when Calvin is exactly causal, i.e. Calvin's decision of whether or

recently characterized to be $1-2p$. In this work we show two (perhaps)

is independent of the ""current bit"" $x_i$) then the capacity increases to $1-p$

encoding is deterministic (i.e. the transmitted codeword is a deterministic
function of the message $m$) then no rate asymptotically larger than $1-2p$ is
possible with vanishing probability of error, hence stochastic encoding (using
private randomness at the encoder) is essential to achieve the capacity of
$1-p$ against a one-bit-delayed Calvin.

reflect (and are a quintessence of) such features of any resistor. The very

electrodynamics sense with electrical and magnetic fields, in the resistive
characteristic v = f(i), forces any resister to accumulate some magnetic and
electrostatic fields and energies around itself, i.e. L and C elements are
always present. From the circuit-theoretic point of view, the role of the
memristor is seen, first of all, in the elimination of the use of a unique
v(i). This makes circuits with hysteresis characteristics relevant, and also
suggests that the concept of memristor should influence the basic problem of
definition of nonlinearity. Since the memristor mainly originates from the
resistor, it was found necessary to overview some unusual cases of resistive
circuits. The present opinion is that the framework of basic circuit theory and
its connection with applications should be logically expanded in order to
naturally include the new element.

interplay between a) a maximal number of available states within the elementary
time lag (i.e. a minimal time interval needed for demise of a final state) and
b) an imprecision or uncertainty in the definition of state. If either the
number of time lags is largely different from 7 or the maximal number of
available states is smaller than 20, the physicochemical conditions are
inappropriate for a formation of the wave-spiral patterns. Furthermore, a white

incomplete, since the intermediate state induced by collapse of the wave
function apparently depends upon the inertial rest frame in which the
experiment is observed. While the Many Worlds Interpretation of Everett, MWI,
avoids the issue of wave function collapse, it, too, is a casualty of the
special theory of relativity. This requires all events in the universe, past,
present and future, to be unique, as in the block universe picture, which rules
out Everett style branching. The benefits of MWI may be retained, however, by
postulating a multiverse of discrete, parallel, block universes which are
identical to each other up to certain points in the MWI trunk before they
diverge according to the MWI branching. The quantum probability of an event
then emerges from the number of parallel universes in which the event happens
divided by the total number of universes. This means that the total number of
such universes is finite. Such a picture is more easily envisaged by thinking
of it as a purely mathematical structure, as in the Mathematical Universe
Hypothesis proposed by Tegmark. However, while Tegmark wished to avoid
contamination from Goedelian self referential knots, not only does such
contamination appear to be inevitable, it brings an unexpected benefit. The
mathematical hierarchy required by the enigmatic footnote 48a in the paper by
Goedel leads to an explanation for a unitary evolution of deterministic quantum
rules across the multiverse while accounting for quantum uncertainty within an
individual universe. Other aspects of this structure, called here the Plexus,
are discussed, including awareness of existence and other questions raised by
the hypothesis.

  extremely rare) exceptions","13 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Statistical mechanics descriptions of the second law of thermodynamics
generally imply point-like particles driven by a dissipative overall mechanism
for their simultaneous time-evolution. As the number of involved particles
grows larger, it becomes more and more unlikely that they by itself adopt an
off-equilibrium state with lower entropy. We present a macroscopic
counterexample of the second law that repeatedly and spontaneously produces an
entropy sink, thus recurrently enables us to harvest energy that sidesteps all
the compensation interactions with the surroundings. Hence, this mechanism
extracts energy from a single reservoir. This proves true in an experiment and
is explained as a consequence of size effects, among them nonzero particle
extent that marginally amend crucial peculiarities of thermodynamic equilibrium
dynamics.

on the condensation of holes into strings in checker-board geometry, was
successful to explain the elastically scattered Neutrons by spin waves. Here it
is extended to analyze the inward dispersion curve of its inelastic
counterpart, up to the resonance energy- . This extension is done by applying
the perturbation theory of the linear response to the condensed strings. The
approximated susceptibility is derived by means of the ring diagram. The
dispersion relation is obtained from the dispersion of the poles of the
susceptibility integral. It is found that the particle anti-particle pair that
yields the susceptibility is the time reversal pair where the particle momentum
is in phase A, and the anti-particle momentum is in phase B. The dispersion is
found to be in agreement with experiment, subject to some suggested
corrections. The weak intensity by the resonance energy, as well as the
dispersion, is speculated to be modified due to interference with spin waves
that are caused by direct spin flip, as in the mother undoped materials.

query processing in client-server databases, especially those on the web.
Despite of the extensive efforts in the database community on designing better
ranking functions/mechanisms, many such databases in practice still fail to
address the diverse and sometimes contradicting preferences of users on tuple
ranking, perhaps (at least partially) due to the lack of expertise and/or
motivation for the database owner to design truly effective ranking functions.
This paper takes a different route on addressing the issue by defining a novel
{\em query reranking problem}, i.e., we aim to design a third-party service
that uses nothing but the public search interface of a client-server database
to enable the on-the-fly processing of queries with any user-specified ranking
functions (with or without selection conditions), no matter if the ranking
function is supported by the database or not. We analyze the worst-case
complexity of the problem and introduce a number of ideas, e.g., on-the-fly
indexing, domination detection and virtual tuple pruning, to reduce the
average-case cost of the query reranking algorithm. We also present extensive
experimental results on real-world datasets, in both offline and live online
systems, that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques.

  superconductors",,,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the recent experiments the unusual oscillatory magnetoresistance in
superconductors was discovered with a periodicity essentially independent on
magnetic field direction and even material parameters. The nearly universal
period points to a subatomic mechanism of the phenomenon. This mechanism is
related to formation inside samples of subatomically thin ($10^{-11}cm$)
threads in the form of rings of the interatomic radius. Electron states of
rings go over into conduction electrons which carry the same spin imbalance in
energy as rings. The imbalance occurs due to spin interaction with the orbital
momentum of the ring. The conductivity near $T_c$ is determined by fluctuating
Cooper pairs consisting of electrons with shifted energies. Due to different
angular momenta of rings these energies periodically depend on magnetic field
resulting in the observed oscillatory magnetoresistance. Calculated universal
positions of peaks $(n+1/2)\Delta H$ ($\Delta H\simeq 0.18T$ and $n=0,1,2...$)
on the $R(H)$ curve are in a good agreement with experiments.
