self-organization. A prominent example is the biological cell where, within a
highly crowded molecular environment, a myriad of different molecular receptor
pairs recognize their binding partner with astonishing accuracy. In thermal
equilibrium it is usually admitted that the affinity of recognizer pairs only
depends on the nature of the two binding molecules. Accordingly, Boltzmann
factors of binding energy differences relate the molecular affinities among
different target molecules that compete for the same probe. Here, we consider
the molecular recognition of short DNA oligonucleotide single strands. We show
that a better matching oligonucleotide strand can prevail against a
disproportionally more concentrated competitor that exhibits reduced affinity
due to a mismatch. The magnitude of deviation from the simple picture above may
reach several orders of magnitude. In our experiments the effective molecular
affinity of a given strand remains elevated only as long as the better matching
competitor is not present. We interpret our observations based on an
energy-barrier of entropic origin that occurs if two competing oligonucleotide
strands occupy the same probe simultaneously. In this situation the relative
binding affinities are reduced asymmetrically, which leads to an expression of
the free energy landscape that represents a formal analogue of a Landau
description of phase transitions. Our mean field description reproduces the
observations in quantitative agreement. The advantage of improved molecular
recognition comes at no energetic cost other than the design of the molecular
ensemble, and the introduction of the competitor. It will be interesting to see
if mechanisms along similar lines as exposed here, contribute to the molecular
synergy that occurs in biological systems.

When appropriately restricted to one complex variable, our condition coincides

${\operatorname{BMO}}$ is that $\exp(c|g|)$ is integrable (on the infinite
polytorus) for some $c > 0$ whenever $\mathbf{T}_g$ is bounded. In particular,
such $g$ belong to $\mathcal{H}^p$ for every $p < \infty$. We relate the
boundedness of $\mathbf{T}_g$ to several other ${\operatorname{BMO}}$ type

we consider the action of $\mathbf{T}_g$ on reproducing kernels for appropriate
sequences of subspaces of $\mathcal{H}^2$. Our proofs employ function and

increasing ability to create novel states of warm-correlated matter (WCM).
Subclasses of WCM are Warm-dense matter (WDM), ultra-fast matter (UFM), and
high-energy density matter (HEDM), containing electyrons (e) and ions (i).
Strong e-e, i-i and e-i correlation effects and partial degeneracies are found
in these systems where the electron temperature $T_e $ is comparable to the
electron Fermi energy. The ion subsystem may be solid, liquid or plasma, with
many states of ionization with ionic charge $Z_j$. Quasi-equilibria with the
ion temperature $T_i\ne T_e$ are common. The ion subsystem in WCM can no longer
be treated as a passive ""external potential"", as is customary in $T=0$ density
functional theory (DFT) dominated by solid-state theory or quantum chemistry.
Hohenberg-Kohn-Mermin theory can be used for WCMs if finite-$T$
exchange-correlation (XC) functionals are available. They are functionals of
both the one-body electron density $n_e$ and the one-body ion densities
$\rho_j$. A method of approximately but accurately mapping the quantum
electrons to a classical Coulomb gas enables one to treat electron-ion systems
entirely classically at any temperature and arbitrary spin polarization, using
exchange-correlation effects calculated {\it in situ}, directly from the
pair-distribution functions. This eliminates the need for any XC-functionals,
or the use of a Born-Oppenheimer approximation. This classical map has been
used to calculate the equation of state of WDM systems, and construct a
finite-$T$ XC functional that is found to be in close agreement with recent
quantum path-integral simulation data. In this review current developments and
concerns in finite-$T$ DFT, especially in the context of non-relativistic
warm-dense matter and ultra-fast matter will be presented.

a filament formation mechanism. We focus the analysis on the mass and thickness
distributions of the resulting filamentary structures. Simulations of both
driven and decaying MHD turbulence show that the morphologies of the density
and the magnetic field are different when ambipolar diffusion is included in
the models. In particular, the densest structures are broader and more massive
as an effect of ion-neutral friction and the power spectra of both the velocity
and the density steepen at a smaller wavenumber. The comparison between ideal
and non-ideal MHD simulations shows that ambipolar diffusion causes a shift of
the filament thickness distribution towards higher values. However, none of the
distributions exhibit the pronounced peak found in the observed local
filaments. Limitations in dynamical range and the absence of self-gravity in
these numerical experiments do not allow us to conclude at this time whether
this is due to the different filament selection or due to the physics inherent
of the filament formation.

neurons communicate between each other with spikes. Spikes are identical
Boolean events characterized by the time of their arrival. A spiking neuron has
internal dynamics and responds to the history of inputs as opposed to the
current inputs only. Because of such properties a spiking neural network has
rich intrinsic capabilities to process spatiotemporal data. However, because
the spikes are discontinuous 'yes or no' events, it is not trivial to apply
traditional training procedures such as gradient descend to the spiking
neurons. In this thesis we propose to use stochastic spiking neuron models in
which probability of a spiking output is a continuous function of parameters.
We formulate several learning tasks as minimization of certain
information-theoretic cost functions that use spiking output probability
distributions. We develop a generalized description of the stochastic spiking
neuron and a new spiking neuron model that allows to flexibly process rich
spatiotemporal data. We formulate and derive learning rules for the following
tasks:
  - a supervised learning task of detecting a spatiotemporal pattern as a
minimization of the negative log-likelihood (the surprisal) of the neuron's
output
  - an unsupervised learning task of increasing the stability of neurons output
as a minimization of the entropy
  - a reinforcement learning task of controlling an agent as a modulated
optimization of filtered surprisal of the neuron's output.
  We test the derived learning rules in several experiments such as
spatiotemporal pattern detection, spatiotemporal data storing and recall with
autoassociative memory, combination of supervised and unsupervised learning to
speed up the learning process, adaptive control of simple virtual agents in
changing environments.

removal of the convexity constraint from the admissible space as convexity
becomes a built-in property of the new formulation. Moreover, this new approach
allows one to tap the wealthy numerical methods, such as semi-Lagrangian
schemes, for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations to solve Monge-Amp\`ere type

pointwise consistent and uniformly stable. Consequently, its solutions converge
uniformly to the unique convex viscosity solution of the Monge-Amp\`ere

the monotonicity of the scheme. Numerical experiments are also presented to

present paper we study slowly rotating neutron stars in scalar-tensor theories

examined - the first example is the massive Brans-Dicke theory and the second
one is a massive scalar-tensor theory indistinguishable from general relativity

field mass on the spontaneous scalarization of neutron stars. Our numerical
results show that the inclusion of a mass term for the scalar field indeed
changes the picture drastically compared to the massless case. It turns out
that mass, radius and moment of inertia for neutron stars in massive
scalar-tensor theories can differ drastically from the pure general
relativistic solutions if sufficiently large masses of the scalar field are

  Quantum Information",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The remarkable discovery of Quantum Error Correction (QEC), which can
overcome the errors experienced by a bit of quantum information (qubit), was a
critical advance that gives hope for eventually realizing practical quantum
computers. In principle, a system that implements QEC can actually pass a
""break-even"" point and preserve quantum information for longer than the
lifetime of its constituent parts. Reaching the break-even point, however, has
thus far remained an outstanding and challenging goal. Several previous works
have demonstrated elements of QEC in NMR, ions, nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers,
photons, and superconducting transmons. However, these works primarily
illustrate the signatures or scaling properties of QEC codes rather than test
the capacity of the system to extend the lifetime of quantum information over
time. Here we demonstrate a QEC system that reaches the break-even point by
suppressing the natural errors due to energy loss for a qubit logically encoded
in superpositions of coherent states, or cat states of a superconducting
resonator. Moreover, the experiment implements a full QEC protocol by using
real-time feedback to encode, monitor naturally occurring errors, decode, and
correct. As measured by full process tomography, the enhanced lifetime of the
encoded information is 320 microseconds without any post-selection. This is 20
times greater than that of the system's transmon, over twice as long as an
uncorrected logical encoding, and 10% longer than the highest quality element
of the system (the resonator's 0, 1 Fock states). Our results illustrate the
power of novel, hardware efficient qubit encodings over traditional QEC
schemes. Furthermore, they advance the field of experimental error correction
from confirming the basic concepts to exploring the metrics that drive system
performance and the challenges in implementing a fault-tolerant system.

Unimodular gravity is constructed by fixing the determinant of the metric, what

integration constant. While unimodular gravity turns out equivalent to General
Relativity (GR) at the classical level, it provides important differences at
the quantum level. Here we extend the unimodular constraint to some extensions
of General Relativity that have drawn a lot of attention over the last years,
as $f(R)$ gravity (or its scalar-tensor picture) and Gauss-Bonnet gravity. The
corresponding unimodular version of such theories is constructed as well as the
conformal transformation that relates the Einstein and Jordan frames for these
non-minimally coupled theories. From the classical point of view, the
unimodular versions of such extensions are completely equivalent to their

provide a richer description of the universe evolution. Here we analyze the

rate (SFR) describes the star formation regulation in disk galaxies. It is a
function of gas metallicity, but the low metallicity regime of the KS diagram
is poorly sampled. We have analyzed data for a representative set of extremely
metal-poor galaxies (XMPs), as well as auxiliary data, and compared these to
empirical and theoretical predictions. The majority of the XMPs possess high
specific SFRs, similar to high redshift star-forming galaxies. On the KS plot,
the XMP HI data occupy the same region as dwarfs, and extend the relation for
low surface brightness galaxies. Considering the HI gas alone, a considerable
fraction of the XMPs already fall off the KS law. Significant quantities of
'dark' H$_2$ mass (i.e., not traced by CO) would imply that XMPs possess low
star formation efficiencies (SFE$_{\rm gas}$). Low SFE$_{\rm gas}$ in XMPs may
be the result of the metal-poor nature of the HI gas. Alternatively, the HI
reservoir may be largely inert, the star formation being dominated by
cosmological accretion. Time lags between gas accretion and star formation may
also reduce the apparent SFE$_{\rm gas}$, as may galaxy winds, which can expel
most of the gas into the intergalactic medium. Hence, on global scales, XMPs
could be HI-dominated, high specific SFR ($\gtrsim $ 10$^{-10}$ yr$^{-1}$), low
SFE$_{\rm gas}$ ($\lesssim$ 10$^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$) systems, in which the total HI
mass is likely not a good predictor of the total H$_2$ mass nor of the SFR.

addressed. One important question is how evolutionary mechanisms can select for
the optimised usage of energy in situations where it does not lead to immediate
advantage. For example, this problem is of great importance to improve our
understanding about the major transition from unicellular to multicellular form
of life. The immediate advantage of gathering efficient individuals in an
energetic context is not clear. Although this process increases relatedness
among individuals, it also increases local competition. To address this
question, we propose a model of two competing metabolic strategies that makes
explicit reference to the resource usage. We assume the existence of an
efficient strain, which converts resource into energy at high efficiency but
displays a low rate of resource consumption, and an inefficient strain, which
consumes resource at a high rate with a low efficiency in converting it to
energy. We explore the dynamics in both well-mixed and structured populations.
The selection for optimised energy usage is measured by the likelihood of that
an efficient strain can invade a population only comprised by inefficient
strains. It is found that the region of the parameter space at which the
efficient strain can thrive in structured populations is always larger than
observed in well-mixed populations. In fact, in well-mixed populations the
efficient strain is only evolutionarily stable in the domain whereupon there is
no evolutionary dilemma. We also observe that small group sizes enhance the
chance of invasion by the efficient strain in spite of increasing the
competition among relatives. This outcome corroborates the key role played by
kin selection and shows that the group dynamics relied on group expansion,
overlapping generations and group split can balance the negative effects of
local competition.

compute the mechanical torques on 13 different irregular grains and examine

principal axis of greatest moment of inertia. We find that the alignment
efficiency in the subsonic drift regime depends sensitively on the grain shape,
with more efficient alignment for shapes with a substantial mechanical torque
even in the case of no drift. The alignment is typically more efficient for
supersonic drift. A more rigorous analysis of the dynamics is required to
definitively appraise the role of mechanical torques in grain alignment.

candidate as well as the possibility of generating neutrino masses radiatively.
The search and identification of DM requires the combined effort of both
indirect and direct DM detection experiments in addition to the LHC.
Remarkably, an excess of GeV gamma rays from the Galactic Center (GCE) has been
measured with the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT) which appears to be
robust with respect to changes in the diffuse galactic background modeling.
Although several astrophysical explanations have been proposed, DM remains a
simple and well motivated alternative. In this work, we examine the
sensitivities of dark matter searches in the SDFDM scenario using
$\textit{Fermi}$-LAT, CTA, IceCube/DeepCore, LUX, PICO and LHC with an emphasis
on exploring the regions of the parameter space that can account for the GCE.
We find that DM particles present in this model with masses close to $\sim 99$
GeV and $\sim (173-190)$ GeV annihilating predominantly into the $W^+W^-$
channel and $t\bar{t}$ channel respectively, provide an acceptable fit to the
GCE while being consistent with different current experimental bounds. We also
find that much of the obtained parameter space can be ruled out by future
direct search experiments like LZ and XENON-1T, in case of null results by
these detectors. Interestingly, we show that the most recent data by LUX is
starting to probe the best fit region in the SDFDM model.

with much of the work in the literature assuming that agents fully know their
own preferences over alternatives. This assumption however is not always
practical (especially in large markets) and agents usually need to go through
some costly deliberation process in order to learn their preferences. In this
paper we assume that such deliberations are carried out via interviews, where
an interview involves a man and a woman, each of whom learns information about
the other as a consequence. If everybody interviews everyone else, then clearly
agents can fully learn their preferences. But interviews are costly, and we may
wish to minimize their use. It is often the case, especially in practical
settings, that due to correlation between agents' preferences, it is
unnecessary for all potential interviews to be carried out in order to obtain a
stable matching. Thus the problem is to find a good strategy for interviews to
be carried out in order to minimize their use, whilst leading to a stable
matching. One way to evaluate the performance of an interview strategy is to
compare it against a naive algorithm that conducts all interviews. We argue
however that a more meaningful comparison would be against an optimal offline
algorithm that has access to agents' preference orderings under complete
information. We show that, unless P=NP, no offline algorithm can compute the
optimal interview strategy in polynomial time. If we are additionally aiming
for a particular stable matching (perhaps one with certain desirable
properties), we provide restricted settings under which efficient optimal
offline algorithms exist.

cluster environs. While most spatially resolved jets are seen in the radio, an
increasing number have been discovered to emit in the optical/near-IR and/or
X-ray bands. Here we discuss a spectacular example of this class, the 3C 111

discuss new, deep Chandra and HST observations that reveal both near-IR and
X-ray emission from several components of the 3C 111 jet, as well as both the
northern and southern hotspots. Important differences are seen between the
morphologies in the radio, X-ray and near-IR bands. The long (over 100 kpc on
each side), straight nature of this jet makes it an excellent prototype for
future, deep observations, as it is one of the longest such features seen in
the radio, near-IR/optical and X-ray bands. Several independent lines of
evidence, including the X-ray and broadband spectral shape as well as the
implied velocity of the approaching hotspot, lead us to strongly disfavor the
EC/CMB model and instead favor a two-component synchrotron model to explain the
observed X-ray emission for several jet components. Future observations with
NuSTAR, HST, and Chandra will allow us to further constrain the emission
mechanisms.

difficult or impossible due to an expensive to evaluate or intractable
likelihood function. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is an inference
framework that constructs an approximation to the true likelihood based on the
similarity between the observed and simulated data as measured by a predefined
set of summary statistics. Although the choice of appropriate problem-specific
summary statistics crucially influences the quality of the likelihood
approximation and hence also the quality of the posterior sample in ABC, there
are only few principled general-purpose approaches to the selection or
construction of such summary statistics. In this paper, we develop a novel
framework for this task using kernel-based distribution regression. We model
the functional relationship between data distributions and the optimal choice
(with respect to a loss function) of summary statistics using kernel-based
distribution regression. We show that our approach can be implemented in a
computationally and statistically efficient way using the random Fourier
features framework for large-scale kernel learning. In addition to that, our

accretion discs around black holes, and the novel theoretical properties of
such solutions, we investigate how a strong magnetization state can develop and
persist. To this end, we perform local simulations of accretion discs with an
initially purely toroidal magnetic field of equipartition strength. We
demonstrate that discs with zero net vertical magnetic flux and realistic
boundary conditions cannot sustain a strong toroidal field. However, a magnetic
pressure-dominated disc can form from an initial configuration with a
sufficient amount of net vertical flux and realistic boundary conditions. Our
results suggest that poloidal flux is a necessary prerequisite for the
sustainability of strongly magnetized accretion discs.

By improving upon a recent model of Mintun, Polchinski, and Rosenhaus, we
demonstrate explicitly how this ambiguity arises in a simple model of the field
theory. In particular, we show how gauge invariance in the boundary theory
manifests as a freedom in the smearing function used in the bulk-boundary
mapping, and explicitly show how this freedom can be used to localize the
precursor in different spatial regions. We also show how the ambiguity can be
understood in terms of quantum error correction, by appealing to the
entanglement present in the CFT. The concordance of these two approaches
suggests that gauge invariance and entanglement in the boundary field theory
are intimately connected to the reconstruction of local operators in the dual

massive halos at high redshifts. We find that the median halo spin parameter
$\lambda_{\rm B} = J(2M_{\rm vir}R_{\rm vir}V_{\rm vir})^{-1}$ is nearly
independent of redshift, leading to predicted evolution of galaxy sizes that is
consistent with observations, while the significant decrease with redshift in
median $\lambda_{\rm P} = J|E|^{-1/2}G^{-1}M^{-5/2}$ predicts more decrease in
galaxy sizes than is observed. Using the Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson
relations between galaxy velocity and mass, we show that a simple model of how
galaxy velocity is related to halo maximum circular velocity leads to
increasing overprediction of cosmic stellar mass density as redshift increases
beyond redshifts $z\sim1$, implying that such velocity-mass relations must
change at redshifts $z>1$. By making a realistic model of how observed galaxy

transfer simulations, we study how the appearance of the spiral arms and the
gap produced in a disk by a companion varies with inclination and position
angle in NIR scattered light. We compare the cases of a $3M_{\rm J}$ and a
$0.1M_{\odot}$ companion, and make predictions suitable for testing with
Gemini/GPI, VLT/NACO/SPHERE, and Subaru/HiCIAO/SCExAO. We find that the two
trailing arms produced by an external perturber can have a variety of
morphologies in inclined systems - they may appear as one trailing arm; two
trailing arms on the same side of the disk; or two arms winding in opposite
directions. The disk ring outside a planetary gap may also mimic spiral arms
when viewed at high inclinations. We suggest potential explanations for the
features observed in HH 30, HD 141569 A, AK Sco, HD 100546, and AB Aur. We
emphasize that inclined views of companion-induced features cannot be converted

correctly treating the axion string cores. We develop a new algorithm for

about twice as efficient as in previous simulations. We argue that the string

'M_BH(M_star)-outlier' galaxies, defined as having M_BH more than 1.5 dex above
the median M_BH(M_star) relation in the simulation, M_{BH,med}. All
M_BH(M_star)-outliers are satellite galaxies, typically with M_star ~ 10^10
M_sun and M_BH ~ 10^8 M_sun. They have all become outliers due to a combination
of tidal stripping of their outer stellar component acting over several Gyr and
early formation times leading to rapid BH growth at high redshift, with the
former mechanism being most important for 67 per cent of these outliers. The
same mechanisms also cause the M_BH(M_star)-outlier satellites to be amongst
the most compact galaxies in the simulation, making them ideal candidates for
ultracompact dwarf galaxy progenitors. The 10 most extreme central galaxies
found at z=0 (with log_{10}(M_BH/M_{BH,med}) in [1.2, 1.5]) grow rapidly in
M_BH to lie well above the present-day M_BH-M_star relation at early times (z >
2), and either continue to evolve parallel to the z=0 relation or remain
unchanged until the present day, making them 'relics' of the high-redshift

No underlying 246GHz continuum emission is seen at either position. We suggest
that the H2O emission is excited in the cooling region behind slow (10-40km/s)
shocks in dense molecular gas (10^{3-5} cm^-3). The extended water emission is
likely evidence of the radio jet's impact in cooling and forming molecules in
the post-shocked gas in the halo and inter-cluster gas similar to what is seen
in low-z clusters and other high-z radio galaxies. These observations imply
that the passage of the radio jet in the interstellar and inter-cluster medium
not only heats gas to high temperatures as is commonly assumed or found in
simulations, but also induces cooling and dissipation which can lead to
substantial amounts of cold dense molecular gas. The formation of molecules and
strong dissipation in the halo gas of MRC1138-262 may explain both the extended
diffuse molecular gas and young stars observed around MRC1138-262.

set of yields that includes seven masses between 13 and 30 Msun, 15
metallicities between 0 and 0.03 in mass fraction, and two different remnant
mass prescriptions. We ran several simulations where we sampled subsets of
stellar models to explore the impact of different grid resolutions. Stellar
yields from low- and intermediate-mass stars and from Type Ia supernovae have
been included in our simulations, but with a fixed grid resolution. We compared
our results with the stellar abundances observed in the Milky Way for O, Na,
Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, and Mn. Our results suggest that the range of metallicity
considered is more important than the number of metallicities within that
range, which only affects our numerical predictions by about 0.1 dex. We found
that our predictions at [Fe/H] < -2 are very sensitive to the metallicity range
and the mass sampling used for the lowest metallicity included in the set of
yields. Variations between results can be as high as 0.8 dex, for any remnant
mass prescription. At higher [Fe/H], we found that the required number of
masses depends on the element of interest and on the remnant mass prescription.
With a monotonic remnant mass prescription where every model explodes as a
core-collapse supernova, the mass resolution induces variations of 0.2 dex on
average. But with a remnant mass prescription that includes islands of
non-explodability, the mass resolution can cause variations of about 0.2 to 0.7
dex depending on the choice of metallicity range. With such a prescription,
explosive or non-explosive models can be missed if not enough masses are
selected, resulting in over- or under-estimations of the mass ejected by
massive stars.

than a factor of three over the rate predicted by dynamical friction with an
untrapped dark halo, and thus provides a possible physical explanation for the

exterior part of the disk. Direct detection of massive gaseous clumps on their
way to collapse into gas giant planets would offer an unprecedented test of the
disk instability model. Here we use state-of-the-art 3D radiation-hydro
simulations of disks undergoing fragmentation into massive gas giants,
post-processed with the RADMC-3D ray-tracing code to produce dust continuum
emission maps. These are then fed into the Common Astronomy Software
Applications (CASA) ALMA simulator. The synthetic maps show that both overdense
spiral arms and actual clumps at different stages of collapse can be detected
with the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) in the full
configuration at the distance of the Ophiuchus star forming region (125 pc).
The detection of clumps is particularly effective at shorter wavelengths (690
GHz) combining two resolutions with multi-scale clean. Furthermore, we show
that a flux-based estimate of the mass of a protoplanetary clump can be from
comparable to a factor of 3 higher than the gravitationally bound clump mass.
The estimated mass depends on the assumed opacity, and on the gas temperature,
which should be set using the input of radiation-hydro simulations. We conclude
that ALMA has the capability to detect ""smoking gun"" systems that are a

test galaxy formation and evolution models. Of particular interest, apart from
the slope of the relation, is its intrinsic scatter. In this paper, we use the
EAGLE simulation to study the dependence of the BTFR on the size of the
simulated galaxy sample. The huge number of datapoint available in the
simulation is indeed not available with current observations. Observational
studies that computed the BTFR used various (small) size samples with the only
obligation to have galaxies spanning over a large range of masses and rotation
rates. Accordingly, to compare observational and theoretical results, we build
a large number of various size datasets using the same criterion and derive the
BTFR for all of them. Unmistakably, their is an effect of the number of
galaxies used to derive the relation. The smaller the number, the larger the
standard deviation around the average slope and intrinsic scatter of a given
size sample of galaxies. This observation allows us to alleviate the tensions
between observational measurements and LCDM predictions. Namely, the size of
the observational samples adds up to the complexity in comparing observed and
simulated relations to discredit or confirm LCDM. Similarly, samples, even
large, that do not reflect the galaxy distribution give on average biased
results. Large size samples reproducing the underlying distribution of galaxies
constitute a supplementary necessity to compare efficiently observations and

cross-correlate against a genuine cosmological signal. The most promising
cosmological signals are wide-field maps of Lyman alpha emitting galaxies
(LAEs), expected from the Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) Ultra-Deep field. Here
we present estimates of the correlation between LAE maps at z~7 and the 21-cm
signal observed by both the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the planned Square
Kilometer Array Phase 1 (SKA1). We adopt a systematic approach, varying both:
(i) the prescription of assigning LAEs to host halos; and (ii) the large-scale
structure of neutral and ionized regions (i.e. EoR morphology). We find that
the LAE-21cm cross-correlation is insensitive to (i), thus making it a robust
probe of the EoR. A 1000h observation with LOFAR would be sufficient to
discriminate at >1 standard deviation a fully ionized Universe from one with a
mean neutral fraction of xHI~0.50, using the LAE-21cm cross-correlation
function on scales of R~3-10 Mpc. Unlike LOFAR, whose detection of the LAE-21cm
cross-correlation is limited by noise, SKA1 is mostly limited by ignorance of

reionization and photoevaporation caused by a nearby galaxy. Once such a halo
reaches $\approx 10^9~M_\odot$, corresponding to the Jeans mass of the
photoheated intergalactic medium (IGM) at $z\approx 7$, pristine gas is able to
collapse into the halo, potentially producing a massive Pop III starburst. We
suggest that this scenario may explain the recent observation of strong He II
1640~\AA~line emission in CR7, which is consistent with $\sim 10^7~M_\odot$ of
young Pop III stars. Such a large mass of Pop III stars is unlikely without the
photoionization feedback scenario, because star formation is expected to inject
metals into halos above the atomic cooling threshold ($\sim 10^8~M_\odot$ at $z

triangulations, and similarly for arbitrary natural transformations. This
2-categorical refinement also provides a uniqueness statement concerning
canonical triangulations.
  These results rely on a more careful study of morphisms of derivators and
this study is of independent interest. We analyze the interaction of morphisms
of derivators with limits, colimits, and Kan extensions, including a discussion
of invariance and closure properties of the class of Kan extensions preserved
by a fixed morphism.

the high frequency limit (or the long time limit) of observations, Bayesian
option prices converge to the standard BS-Option price with the true

Nevertheless, the orthogonality does not hold for transformations of

and obtain consistent results as in the Gaussian case. In particular, for
stationary processes, the transformations of short-memory time series still
have short-memory and the transformation of long-memory time series may have
different weaker memory parameters which depend on the power rank of the
transformation. On the other hand, the memory properties of transformations of
non-stationary time series may not depend on the power ranks of the
transformations. This study has application in econometrics and financial data

information diffusion among the agents and the publications themselves
effectively result in a dynamic process which we capture by an interconnected
system of networks (i.e. layered). More specifically, we use a notion of a
supra-Laplacian matrix to address such a generalized diffusion of an
interconnected network starting with the classical ""graph Laplacian"". The
auxiliary and external input update is modeled by a multidimensional Brownian
process, yielding two contributions to the variations in the states of the
agents: one that is due to the intrinsic interactions in the network system,

to a Kalman predictor problem. This helps us refine the predicted states
exploiting the error in estimating the states of agents. Three real-world

Despite their
importance, a detailed understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for
the driving of these winds is lacking. In an effort to gain more insight into
the nature of these flows, we perform global three-dimensional
magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of an isolated Milky Way-size starburst
galaxy. We focus on the dynamical role of cosmic rays injected by supernovae,
and specifically on the impact of the streaming and anisotropic diffusion of
cosmic rays along the magnetic fields. We find that these microphysical effects
can have a significant effect on the wind launching and mass loading factors
depending on the details of the plasma physics. Due to the cosmic ray streaming
instability, cosmic rays propagating in the interstellar medium scatter on
self-excited Alfven waves and couple to the gas. When the wave growth due to
the streaming instability is inhibited by some damping process, such as the
turbulent damping, the cosmic ray coupling to the gas is weaker and their
effective propagation speed faster than the Alfven speed. Alternatively, cosmic
rays could scatter from ""extrinsic turbulence"" that is driven by another
mechanism. We demonstrate that the presence of moderately super-Alfvenic cosmic
ray streaming enhances the efficiency of galactic wind driving. Cosmic rays
stream away from denser regions near the galactic disk along partially ordered
magnetic fields and, in the process, accelerate more tenuous gas away from the
galaxy. For cosmic ray acceleration efficiencies broadly consistent with the
observational constraints, cosmic rays reduce the galactic star formation rates
and significantly aid in launching galactic winds.

bright isolated stars). The relative astrometric residuals are typically within
10 mas, with a value for the mode (i.e., most common value) of 2.3 mas. The

of a positive random variable X. The main reason is the well-known boundary
bias problems that it suffers from, but also its poor behaviour in the long
right tail that such a density typically exhibits. A natural approach to this
problem is to first estimate the density of the logarithm of X, and obtaining
an estimate of the density of X using standard results on functions of random
variables (`back-transformation'). Although intuitive, the basic application of
this idea yields very poor results, as was documented earlier in the
literature. In this paper, the main reason for this underachievement is
identified, and an easy fix is suggested. It is demonstrated that combining the
transformation with local likelihood density estimation methods produces very
good estimators of R+-supported densities, not only close to the boundary, but
also in the right tail. The asymptotic properties of the proposed `local
likelihood transformation kernel density estimators' are derived for a generic
transformation, not only for the logarithm, which allows one to consider other
transformations as well. One of them, called the `probex' transformation, is
given more focus. Finally, the excellent behaviour of those estimators in
practice is evidenced through a comprehensive simulation study and the analysis
of several real data sets. A nice consequence of articulating the method around
local-likelihood estimation is that the resulting density estimates are
typically smooth and visually pleasant, without oversmoothing important
features of the underlying density.

developed. A Newton-Raphson algorithm searches for the coils' displacements and
tilts that minimize the discrepancy between the measured and computed flux
surfaces. This method was verified by misplacing and tilting the coils in a
numerical model of CNT, calculating the flux surfaces that they generated, and
testing the algorithm's ability to deduce the coils' displacements and tilts.
Subsequently, the numerical method was applied to the experimental data,
arriving at a set of coil displacements whose resulting field errors exhibited
significantly improved quantitative and qualitative agreement with experimental
results.

spatial universe, capable of moving in that universe. When activated, the robot
observes the universe and the location of the other robots, chooses a
destination, and moves there. The computation of the destination is made by
executing an algorithm, the same for all robots, whose sole input is the
current observation. No memory of all these actions is retained after the move.
When the universe is a graph, distributed computations by oblivious mobile
robots have been intensively studied focusing on the conditions for feasibility
of basic problems (e.g., gathering, exploration) in specific classes of graphs
under different schedulers. In this paper, we embark on a different, more
general, type of investigation.
  With their movements from vertices to neighboring vertices, the robots make
the system transition from one configuration to another. Viewing this
transition as the computation of an abstract function, we ask which functions
are computed by which systems. Our main interest is on identifying sets of
systems that are ""universal"", in the sense that they can collectively compute
all finite functions. We are able to identify several such classes of fully
synchronous systems. In particular, among other results, we prove the
universality of the set of all graphs with at least one robot, of any set of
graphs with at least two robots whose quotient graphs contain arbitrarily long
paths, and of any set of graphs with at least three robots and arbitrarily
large finite girths.
  We then focus on the minimum size that a network must have for the robots to
be able to compute all functions on a given finite set. We are able to
approximate the minimum size of such a network up to a factor that tends to 2
as $n$ goes to infinity.

difficult problem because of the nonconvex cost function of the perspective
camera motion equation and because of non-Gaussian noise arising from noisy
optical flow estimates and scene non-rigidity. To address this problem, we
introduce the expected residual likelihood method (ERL), which estimates
confidence weights for noisy optical flow data using likelihood distributions
of the residuals of the flow field under a range of counterfactual model
parameters. We show that ERL is effective at identifying outliers and
recovering appropriate confidence weights in many settings. We compare ERL to a
novel formulation of the perspective camera motion equation using a lifted
kernel, a recently proposed optimization framework for joint parameter and
confidence weight estimation with good empirical properties. We incorporate
these strategies into a motion estimation pipeline that avoids falling into
local minima. We find that ERL outperforms the lifted kernel method and
baseline monocular egomotion estimation strategies on the challenging KITTI

resolution has been frustrated by the essential nonlinear features in the
hydrodynamic case. Even in the case of EM waves in flowing media, the results
are subtle. For a simple shear flow of constant n fluid, incident radiation is
shown to be reflected and refracted in an analogous manner to Snell's law.
However, the beam intensities differ and the system has an asymmetry in that an
internal reflection gap opens at steep incident angles nearly oriented with the
shear. For EM waves these effects are generally negligible in real systems but
they introduce the topic at a reduced level of complexity of the more
interesting acoustic case. Acoustic streaming is suggested, both from theory
and experimental data, to be associated with vorticity generation at the driver
itself. Bounds on the vorticity in bulk and nonlinear effects demonstrate that
the bulk sources, even with attenuation, cannot drive such a strong flow. A
review of the velocity scales in the problem suggest that a variation of the
Scholte wave at the driver-fluid interface with local cavitation on the
decompression phase creates a lateral flow of fluid that generates the stream
and imparts the vorticity from the driver plate. In the case of Darcy flow in
sintered media, an analysis of data suggests that acoustically enhanced flow
may be the result of surface effects that narrow channels that are cleared by
ultrasonic cavitation.

Raman scattering (SERS). The long range Coulomb coupling between LSPs in
periodic metallic nanostructures may lead to interesting collective effects. In
this paper, we investigate the combination effects of the local field
enhancement and collective plasmon resonances in one dimensional metallic
nanoparticle dimer chains. It is found that the strong near field in the gap
and the far field interactions among the metallic nanoparticles lead to
anomalous collective hotspots with dual enhancement of the electromagnetic
field. In particular, the interference between the incident field and the
induced internal field leads to Fano-type effect with Wood anomaly related
destructive interference and the strong resonance with an extremely narrow
width. Our systematic study shows that the correlation between the local

arbitrary number of scalar fields, which exhibits scale invariance via the

limit. This flat direction is lifted by small quantum corrections and inflation
is realised without need for an unnatural fine-tuning. In the conformal limit,
the effective potential becomes linear in the inflaton field, yielding to
specific predictions for the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio,
being respectively: $n_s-1\approx -0.025\left(\frac{N_{\star}}{60}\right)^{-1}$
and $r\approx 0.0667\left(\frac{N_{\star}}{60}\right)^{-1}$, where
$N_{\star}\approx 30-65$ is a number of efolds during observable inflation.
This predictions are in reasonable agreement with cosmological measurements.
Further improvement of the accuracy of these measurements may turn out to be
critical in falsifying our scenario.

However, the research on optimally removing errors from the FB classification
is sparse, and the errors often accumulate rapidly, causing significant errors
in the propagated frames. In this work, we take the initial steps to addressing
this problem, and we call this new task \emph{segmentation rectification}. Our
key observation is that the possibly asymmetrically distributed false positive
and false negative errors were handled equally in the conventional methods. We,
alternatively, propose to optimally remove these two types of errors. To this
effect, we propose a novel bilayer Markov Random Field (MRF) model for this new
task. We also adopt the well-established structured learning framework to learn
the optimal model from data. Additionally, we propose a novel one-class
structured SVM (OSSVM) which greatly speeds up the structured learning process.
Our method naturally extends to RGB-D videos as well. Comprehensive experiments
on both RGB and RGB-D data demonstrate that our simple and effective method
significantly outperforms the segmentation propagation methods adopted in the
state-of-the-art video cutout systems, and the results also suggest the
potential usefulness of our method in image cutout system.

consider a nonlinear filtering scheme over a Distributed Network of Agents
(DNA), which relies on the distributed evaluation of the likelihood part of the
centralized nonlinear filter and is based on a particular specialization of the
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for fast average consensus.
Assuming the same number of consensus steps between any two consecutive noisy
measurements for each sensor in the network, we fully characterize a minimal
number of such steps, such that the distributed filter remains uniformly stable
with a prescribed accuracy level, {\varepsilon} \in (0,1], within a finite
operational horizon, T, and across all sensors. Stability is in the sense of
the \ell_1-norm between the centralized and distributed versions of the
posterior at each sensor, and at each time within T. Roughly speaking, our main
result shows that uniform {\varepsilon}-stability of the distributed filtering
process depends only loglinearly on T and (roughly) the size of the network,
and only logarithmically on 1/{\varepsilon}. If this total loglinear bound is
fulfilled, any additional consensus iterations will incur a fully quantified
further exponential decay in the consensus error. Our bounds are universal, in

detect sharp surface features, such as wrinkles. We use this information to
detect the regions that need to be pulled and extended before ironing, and the

contains trace and antisymmetric operators apart from the symmetric-traceless

stress tensor $(T_{\mu\nu})$ and the $\phi_i\phi^i$ scalar, we also have other
minimal twist operators as the spin-1 current $J_\mu$ and the

these additional objects on the anomalous dimensions of the corresponding
trace, symmetric-traceless and antisymmetric operators in the large spin sector
of the $O(N)$ model, in the limit when the spin is much larger than the twist.
As an observation, we also verified that the leading order results for the
large spin sector from the $\epsilon-$expansion are an exact match with our
$n=0$ case. A plausible holographic setup for the special case when $N=2$ is
also mentioned which mimics the calculation in the CFT.

uncovers the basic kinematic structure of the transport dynamics, and
identifies regions of local stability or chaos. While elliptic and hyperbolic
points typically govern such behaviour in 3D systems, degenerate (parabolic)
points play a more important role than expected. These points represent a
bifurcation in local stability and Lagrangian topology. In this study we
consider the ramifications of the two types of degenerate periodic points that
occur in a model 3D fluid flow. (1) Period-tripling bifurcations occur when the
local rotation angle associated with elliptic points is reversed, creating a
reversal in the orientation of associated Lagrangian structures. Even though a
single unstable point is created, the bifurcation in local stability has a
large influence on local transport and the global arrangement of manifolds as
the unstable degenerate point has three stable and three unstable directions,
similar to hyperbolic points, and occurs at the intersection of three
hyperbolic periodic lines. The presence of period-tripling bifurcation points
indicates regions of either chaos or confinement depending on the nature of the
associated manifold intersections. (2) The second type of bifurcation occurs
when periodic lines become tangent to local or global invariant surfaces. This
bifurcation creates both saddle-centre bifurcations which can create both
chaotic and stable regions, and period-doubling bifurcations which are a common
route to chaos in 2D systems. We provide conditions for the occurrence of these
tangent bifurcations in 3D conservative systems, as well as constraints on the
possible types of tangent bifurcation that can occur based on topological
considerations.

a well-defined superconducting gap on the As terminations, while the gap

boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite
important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action

understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to
transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this
work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the
predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by
learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose
a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions
and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular
optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by
explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image
classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via
novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios

models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier
should not be trusted.

novel 3D analysis technique. We use the new code 3D-Barolo, that models the
galaxy emission directly in the 3D observational space, without the need to
extract kinematic maps. This technique's major advantage is that it is not
affected by beam smearing and thus it enables the determination of rotation
velocity and intrinsic velocity dispersion, even at low spatial resolution. We
find that: 1) the rotation curves of these z~1 galaxies rise very steeply
within few kiloparsecs and remain flat out to the outermost radius and 2) the
H-alpha velocity dispersions are low, ranging from 15 to 40 km/s, which leads
to V/sigma = 3-10. These characteristics are similar to those of disc galaxies
in the local Universe. Finally, we also report no significant evolution of the

of 'delta-hedging' strategies, and is based on the recently developed
'non-anticipative functional calculus'. Two versions of the statement involve
respectively continuous and c\`adl\`ag price paths. The second proposition is a
pathwise replication result that generalizes the ones obtained in the classical
framework of diffusion models. Moreover, it gives an explicit and purely

hidden in one of many boxes that are ordered by importance. That is, if a
treasure is in a more important box, then one would like to find it faster.
Assuming there are many searchers, the authors suggest that using an algorithm
that requires no coordination between searchers can be highly beneficial.
Indeed, besides saving the need for a communication and coordination mechanism,
such algorithms enjoy inherent robustness. The authors proceed to solve this
linear search problem in the case of countably many boxes and an adversary
placed treasure, and prove that the best speed-up possible by $k$
non-coordinating searchers is precisely $\frac{k}{4}(1+1/k)^2$. In particular,
this means that asymptotically, the speed-up is four times worse compared to
the case of full coordination.
  We suggest an important variant of the problem, where the treasure is placed
uniformly at random in one of a finite, large, number of boxes. We devise
non-coordinating algorithms that achieve a speed-up of $6/5$ for two searchers,
a speed-up of $3/2$ for three searchers, and in general, a speed-up of
$k(k+1)/(3k-1)$ for any $k \geq 1$ searchers. Thus, as $k$ grows to infinity,
the speed-up approaches three times worse compared to the case of full
coordination. Moreover, these bounds are tight in a strong sense as no
non-coordinating search algorithm for $k$ searchers can achieve better
speed-ups. We also devise non-coordinating algorithms that use only logarithmic
memory in the size of the search domain, and yet, asymptotically, achieve the
optimal speed-up. Finally, we note that all our algorithms are extremely simple
and hence applicable.

consider the fluid to have a non-zero magnetization. First, we assume a
constant magnetic susceptibility $\chi_{m}$ and consider an ultrarelativistic
ideal gas equation of state. For a paramagnetic fluid (i.e., with
$\chi_{m}>0$), the decay of the energy density slows down since the fluid gains
energy from the magnetic field. For a diamagnetic fluid (i.e., with
$\chi_{m}<0$), the energy density decays faster because it feeds energy into
the magnetic field. Furthermore, when the magnetic field is taken to be
external and to decay in proper time $\tau$ with a power law $\sim\tau^{-a}$,
two distinct solutions can be found depending on the values of $a$ and
$\chi_m$. Finally, we also solve the ideal magnetohydrodynamical equations for
one-dimensional Bjorken flow with a temperature-dependent magnetic
susceptibility and a realistic equation of state given by lattice-QCD data. We
find that the temperature and energy density decay more slowly because of the
non-vanishing magnetization. For values of the magnetic field typical for
heavy-ion collisions, this effect is, however, rather small. Only for magnetic
fields which are about an order of magnitude larger than expected for heavy-ion

suppression of superconductivity without arsenic covering. When a pair of
arsenic atoms is placed on such iron surface, a localized topographic feature
is formed due to Fe-As orbital hybridization, and the superconducting coherent
peaks recover locally with the gap magnitude the same as that on the iron-layer
fully covered by arsenic. These observations unravel the Fe-As interactions on
an atomic scale and imply its essential roles in the iron-based
superconductivity.

universal gate set, in the sense that every permutation of $\{0,1\}^n$ can be
implemented as a composition of these gates. Since every bit operation that
does not use all of the bits performs an even permutation, we need to use at
least one auxiliary bit to perform every permutation, and it is known that one
bit is indeed enough. Without auxiliary bits, all even permutations can be
implemented. We generalize these results to non-binary logic: If $A$ is a
finite set of odd cardinality then a finite gate set can generate all
permutations of $A^n$ for all $n$, without any auxiliary symbols. If the
cardinality of $A$ is even then, by the same argument as above, only even
permutations of $A^n$ can be implemented for large $n$, and we show that indeed
all even permutations can be obtained from a finite universal gate set. We also
consider the conservative case, that is, those permutations of $A^n$ that
preserve the weight of the input word. The weight is the vector that records
how many times each symbol occurs in the word. It turns out that no finite
conservative gate set can, for all $n$, implement all conservative even

that can implement all those conservative permutations that are even within

than expected at their first discovery in the late 1970s. Assuming that the
reference gene is read in frame +0, an overlapping gene can be encoded in two
reading frames in the sense strand, denoted by +1 and +2, and in three reading
frames in the opposite strand, denoted by -0, -1 and -2. This motivated
numerous researchers to study the constraints induced by the genetic code on
the various overlapping frames, mostly based on information theory. Our focus
in this paper is on the constraints induced on two overlapping genes in terms
of amino acids, as well as polypeptides. We show that simple linear constraints
bind the amino acid composition of two proteins encoded by overlapping genes.
Novel constraints are revealed when polypeptides are considered, and not just
single amino acids. For example, in double-coding sequences with an overlapping
reading frame -2, each Tyrosine (denoted as Tyr or Y) in the overlapping frame
overlaps a Tyrosine in the reference frame +0 (and reciprocally), whereas
specific words (e.g. YY) never occur. We thus distinguish between null
constraints (YY = 0 in frame -2) and non-null constraints (Y in frame +0 <=> Y
in frame -2). Our equivalence-based constraints are symmetrical and thus enable
the characterization of the joint composition of overlapping proteins. We
describe several formal frameworks and a graph algorithm to characterize and
compute these constraints. These results yield support for understanding the
mechanisms and evolution of overlapping genes, and for developing novel
overlapping gene detection methods.

earlier conclusion, based on an analysis of the elements of the Galactic

strongly influenced by the photon energy and polarization. Therefore, the
charge dynamics in the system is investigated in two different regimes, for
off- and on-resonant photon fields. In the off-resonant photon field, the
photon energy is smaller than the energy spacing between the first two lowest
subbands of the waveguide system, the charge splits between the waveguides
implementing a $\sqrt{\rm NOT}$-quantum logic gate action. In the on-resonant
photon field, the charge is totally switched from one waveguide to the other
due to the appearance of photon replica states of the first subband in the
second subband region instigating a quantum-NOT transition.In addition, the
importance of the photon polarization to control the charge motion in the
waveguide system is demonstrated.The idea of charge switching in electronic
circuits may serve to built quantum bits.

the input unpooled features by using convolutional weights tied with the

unpooling-deconvolution combination helps to eliminate less discriminative

renormalization of solvent composition near the polymer backbone, the universal
intermolecular excluded volume and Van-der-Waals interactions within the
self-consistent field theory the reentrant coil-to-globule-to-coil transition
(co-nonsolvency) has been described in this paper. For convenience we split the
system volume in two parts: the volume occupied by the polymer chain and the
volume of bulk solution. Considering the equilibrium between two sub-volumes,
the polymer solvation free energy as a function of radius of gyration and
co-solvent mole fraction within internal polymer volume has been obtained.
Minimizing the free energy of solvation with respect to its arguments, we show
two qulitatively different regimes of co-nonsolvency. Namely, at sufficiently
high temperature a reentrant coil-to-globule-to-coil transition proceeds
smoothly. On the contrary, when the temperature drops below a certain threshold
value a coil-globule transition occurs in the regime of first-order phase
transition, i.e., discontinuous changes of the radius of gyration and the local
co-solvent mole fraction near the polymer backbone. We show that, when the
collapse of polymer chain takes place, the entropy and enthalpy contributions
to the solvation free energy of globule strongly grow. From the first
principles of statistical thermodynamics we confirm earlier speculations based
on the MD simulations results that the co-nonsolvency is the essentially
enthalpic-entropic effect and caused by enthalpy-entropy compensation. We show
that the temperature dependences of solution heat capacity change due to the
solvation of polymer chain are in qualitative agreement with the Differential
scanning calorimetry data for PNIPAM in aqueous methanol.

with the square root of the initial pressure perturbation and that a finite
Larmor radius contributes to highly compact blob structures that propagate in
the poloidal direction. An extensive parameter study reveals that a smooth
transition to this compact blob regime occurs when the finite Larmor radius
effect strength, defined by the ratio of the magnetic field aligned component
of the ion diamagnetic to the $\vec{E}\times\vec{B}$ vorticity, exceeds unity.
The maximal radial blob velocities agree excellently with the inertial velocity
scaling law over more than an order of magnitude. We show that the finite
Larmor radius effect strength affects the poloidal and total particle transport
and present an empirical scaling law for the poloidal and total blob
velocities. Distinctions to the blob behaviour in the isothermal limit with
constant finite Larmor radius effects are highlighted.

(Fe/Ca) varies by up to approximately two orders of magnitudes over a narrow

diversity in the composition of the accreted material: In the case of NLTT888,
the inferred composition of the accreted matter is akin to iron-rich planetary

by extending some standard probabilistic modelling tools to the circular

variables, called the multivariate Generalised von Mises (mGvM) distribution.
This distribution can be constructed by restricting and renormalising a general
multivariate Gaussian distribution to the unit hyper-torus. Previously proposed
multivariate circular distributions are shown to be special cases of this
construction. Second, we introduce a new probabilistic model for circular
regression, that is inspired by Gaussian Processes, and a method for
probabilistic principal component analysis with circular hidden variables.
These models can leverage standard modelling tools (e.g. covariance functions
and methods for automatic relevance determination). Third, we show that the
posterior distribution in these models is a mGvM distribution which enables
development of an efficient variational free-energy scheme for performing
approximate inference and approximate maximum-likelihood learning.

and the contribution of PAHs to the extinction and emission curves. We studied
the interaction of PAH cations with VUV photons in the 7-20 eV range from the

relative intensities of photo-fragmentation and photo-ionization for a set of
eight PAH cations ranging in size from 14 to 24 carbon atoms, with different

smaller species, while for larger species ionization is immediately competitive
after the second ionization potential (IP). At higher photon energies, all
species behave similarly, the ionization yield gradually increases, leveling
off between 0.8 and 0.9 at ~18 eV. Among isomers, PAH structure appears to
mainly affect the fragmentation cross section, but not the ionization cross
section. We also measured the second IP for all species and the third IP for

idea is to construct a deterministic coupling---i.e., a transport map---between
a complex ""target"" probability measure of interest and a simpler reference
measure. Given a transport map, one can generate arbitrarily many independent
and unweighted samples from the target simply by pushing forward reference
samples through the map. We consider two different and complementary scenarios:
first, when only evaluations of the unnormalized target density are available,
and second, when the target distribution is known only through a finite
collection of samples. We show that in both settings the desired transports can
be characterized as the solutions of variational problems. We then address
practical issues associated with the optimization--based construction of
transports: choosing finite-dimensional parameterizations of the map, enforcing
monotonicity, quantifying the error of approximate transports, and refining
approximate transports by enriching the corresponding approximation spaces.
Approximate transports can also be used to ""Gaussianize"" complex distributions
and thus precondition conventional asymptotically exact sampling schemes. We
place the measure transport approach in broader context, describing connections
with other optimization--based samplers, with inference and density estimation
schemes using optimal transport, and with alternative transformation--based
approaches to simulation. We also sketch current work aimed at the construction
of transport maps in high dimensions, exploiting essential features of the
target distribution (e.g., conditional independence, low-rank structure). The
approaches and algorithms presented here have direct applications to Bayesian
computation and to broader problems of stochastic simulation.

by a heavy body (source) on a lighter particle when the interaction between
them is electromagnetic and relativistic. The work can be defined via the
gauge-invariant kinetic energy of the source. We uncover a formulation of the
first law (or the generalized work-energy theorem) which is derived from
relativistic dynamics, has definite validity conditions, and relates the work
to the particle's Hamiltonian in the Lorenz gauge. Thereby the thermodynamic
work also relates to the mechanic work done by the Lorentz force acting on the
source. The formulation of the first law is based on a specific separation of
the overall energy into those of the source, particle and electromagnetic

Hence it holds relativistic covariance and causality.

translational invariance along the edge, e.g. due to the presence of disorder,
energy can be exchanged by non-momentum conserving two-particle collisions. For

increase of reddening towards MT304 suggests that the reddening excess may be
caused by the circumstellar shell ejected by the star during its evolution.
This shell absorbs 1 mag, but its chemical composition and temperature are
unclear. We also report the detection of a second component of MT304, and
discovery of an even fainter third component, based on data of speckle

repair process of the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photoproduct (CPD) lesion,
which is an electron transfer (ET) from a flavine cofactor to CPD, and study
the role of various nuclear degrees of freedom (DOF) in this step. The ET step
has been experimentally studied using transient spectroscopy and the
corresponding data provide excellent basis for testing the quality of quantum
dynamical models. Based on previous theoretical studies of electronic structure

diabatic Hamiltonian for simulating the ET reaction in a molecular complex
mimicking the enzyme's active site. We generate a reduced nuclear dimensional
model that provides a first non-empirical quantum dynamical description of the
structural features influencing the ET rate. By varying the nuclear DOF

we demonstrate that the low frequency flavin butterfly bending mode slows ET by
reducing Franck-Condon overlaps between donor and acceptor states and also
induces decoherence.

to study how to fuse W states via light-matter interface. Here we show that it
is possible to prepare large-size W-state networks using a fusion mechanism in

cavity mode constitute the main fusion mechanism, based on which two or three
small-size atomic W states can be fused into a larger-size W state. If no
excitation is detected from those three atoms, the remaining atoms are still in
the product of two or three new W states, which can be re-fused. The
complicated Fredkin gate used in the previous fusion schemes is avoided here. W
states of size 2 can be fused as well. The feasibility analysis shows that our
fusion processes maybe implementable with the current technology. Our results
demonstrate how the light-matter interaction based fusion mechanism can be
realized, and may become the starting point for the fusion of multipartite

biggest day for human trafficking in the United States each year has been
perpetuated in popular press despite a lack of evidentiary support. The
practice of relying on hearsay and popular belief for decision-making may
result in misappropriation of resources in anti-trafficking efforts. We propose
a data-driven approach to analyzing sex trafficking, especially as it is
carried on during--and perhaps in response to--large public events such as the
Super Bowl. We examine 33 public events, chosen for attendance numbers
comparable to the Super Bowl from a diversity of types, and use the volume of
escort advertisements posted online as an accessible and reasonable proxy
measure for the actual levels of activity of sex-workers as well as trafficking
victims. Our analysis puts the impact of local public events on sex
advertisement activity into perspective. We find that many of the events we
considered are not correlated with statistically significant impact on
sex-worker advertising, though some are. Additionally, we demonstrate how our
method can uncover evidence of other events, not included in our initial list,
that are correlated with more significant increases in ad activity. Reliance on
quantitative evidence accessible through data-driven analysis can inform wise
resource allocation, guide good policies, and foster the most meaningful
impact.

that the gamma-ray emission is caused by a relativistic outflow with Lorentz
factor larger than 10. Subsequently, debris outflow pushes the ambient gas to
form a shock, which is responsible for the afterglow synchrotron emission. We
find that the 1.4 GHz radio flux peaks at $\sim10^5$ sec after the burst
trigger. If the ambient matter is dense enough with density larger than
$\sim10^{-2}$ cm$^{-3}$, then the peak radio flux is $\sim0.1$ mJy, which is
detectable with radio telescopes such as the Very Large Array. The optical
afterglow peaks earlier than the radio, and if the ambient matter density is
larger than $\sim0.1$ cm$^{-3}$, the optical flux is detectable with large
telescopes such as the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam. To reveal the currently
unknown mechanisms of the outflow and its gamma-ray emission associated with
the binary black hole merger event, follow-up electromagnetic observations of
afterglows are important. Detection of the afterglow will localize the sky
position of the gravitational wave and the gamma-ray emissions, and it will
support the physical association between them.

systematically studied the electronic structures of recently discovered

both LaSb and LaBi are semimetals with the electron and hole carriers in
perfect balance. The calculated carrier densities in the order of $10^{20}$
cm$^{-3}$ are in good agreement with the experimental values, implying long
mean free time of carriers and thus high carrier mobilities. With a
semiclassical two-band model, the perfect charge compensation and high carrier
mobilities naturally explain (i) the XMR observed in LaSb and LaBi; (ii) the
non-saturating quadratic dependence of XMR on external magnetic field; and
(iii) the resistivity plateau in the turn-on temperature behavior at very low
temperatures. The explanation of these features without resorting to the
topological effect indicates that they should be the common characteristics of
all perfectly electron-hole compensated semimetals.

question that has been the subject of much recent research. Redundant
information refers to information about a target variable S that is common to
two or more predictor variables Xi. It can be thought of as quantifying
overlapping information content or similarities in the representation of S
between the Xi. We present a new measure of redundancy which measures the
common change in surprisal shared between variables at the local or pointwise
level. We provide a game-theoretic operational definition of unique
information, and use this to derive constraints which are used to obtain a
maximum entropy distribution. Redundancy is then calculated from this maximum
entropy distribution by counting only those local co-information terms which
admit an unambiguous interpretation as redundant information. We show how this
redundancy measure can be used within the framework of the Partial Information
Decomposition (PID) to give an intuitive decomposition of the multivariate
mutual information into redundant, unique and synergistic contributions. We
compare our new measure to existing approaches over a range of example systems,
including continuous Gaussian variables. Matlab code for the measure is
provided, including all considered examples.

Our results suggest that in most cases, noncanonical quintessence with such

the scaling solution is not an attractor, there is a wide range of model
parameters for which the evolution asymptotically resembles a zero-potential
solution with equation of state parameter $w = 1/(2\alpha -1)$, and oscillatory
solutions are also possible for positive power-law potentials; we derive the
conditions on the model parameters which produce both types of behavior. We
investigate thawing noncanonical models with a nearly-flat potential and derive
approximate expressions for the evolution of $w(a)$. These forms for $w(a)$
differ in a characteristic way from the corresponding expressions for canonical

space-time adaptive processing (STAP). A priori knowledge of the interference
environment has been exploited in many previous works to enable accurate
estimators even when training is not generous. Specifically, recent work has
shown that employing practical constraints such as the rank of clutter subspace
and the condition number of disturbance covariance leads to powerful estimators
that have closed form solutions. While rank and the condition number are very
effective constraints, often practical non-idealities makes it difficult for
them to be known precisely using physical models. Therefore, we propose a
robust covariance estimation method for radar STAP via an expected likelihood
(EL) approach. We analyze covariance estimation algorithms under three cases of
imperfect constraints: 1) a rank constraint, 2) both rank and noise power
constraints, and 3) condition number constraint. In each case, we formulate
precise constraint determination as an optimization problem using the EL
criterion. For each of the three cases, we derive new analytical results which
allow for computationally efficient, practical ways of setting these
constraints. In particular, we prove formally that both the rank and condition
number as determined by the EL criterion are unique. Through experimental
results from a simulation model and the KASSPER data set, we show the estimator
with optimal constraints obtained by the EL approach outperforms state of the
art alternatives.

the inference of cancer progression from genomic data. The motivations are
manifold: (i) growing NGS and single cell data from cancer patients, (ii) need
for novel Data Science and Machine Learning algorithms to infer models of
cancer progression, and (iii) a desire to understand the temporal and
heterogeneous structure of tumor to tame its progression by efficacious
therapeutic intervention. This thesis presents a multi-disciplinary effort to
model tumor progression involving successive accumulation of genetic
alterations, each resulting populations manifesting themselves in a cancer
phenotype. The framework presented in this work along with algorithms derived
from it, represents a novel approach for inferring cancer progression, whose
accuracy and convergence rates surpass the existing techniques. The approach
derives its power from several fields including algorithms in machine learning,
theory of causality and cancer biology. Furthermore, a modular pipeline to
extract ensemble-level progression models from sequenced cancer genomes is
proposed. The pipeline combines state-of-the-art techniques for sample
stratification, driver selection, identification of fitness-equivalent
exclusive alterations and progression model inference. Furthermore, the results
are validated by synthetic data with realistic generative models, and
empirically interpreted in the context of real cancer datasets; in the later
case, biologically significant conclusions are also highlighted. Specifically,
it demonstrates the pipeline's ability to reproduce much of the knowledge on
colorectal cancer, as well as to suggest novel hypotheses. Lastly, it also
proves that the proposed framework can be applied to reconstruct the
evolutionary history of cancer clones in single patients, as illustrated by an
