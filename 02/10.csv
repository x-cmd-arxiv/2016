nonparametric models to address this problem. These models are based on a
combination of a Potts-like spatial smoothness component and a prior on
partitions which is used to control both the number and size of clusters. This
class of models is flexible enough to include the standard Potts model and the
more recent Potts-Dirichlet Process model \cite{Orbanz2008}. More importantly,
any prior on partitions can be introduced to control the global clustering
structure so that it is possible to penalize small or large clusters if
necessary. Bayesian computation is carried out using an original generalized
Swendsen-Wang algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our method is competitive
in terms of RAND\ index compared to popular image segmentation methods, such as
mean-shift, and recent alternative Bayesian nonparametric models.

we examine the implications of these results for the evolution of stellar
magnetic fields, and we make predictions for future observations. Those stars
with suppressed dipole modes indicative of strong core fields should exhibit
moderate but detectable quadrupole mode suppression. The long magnetic
diffusion times within stellar cores ensure that dynamo-generated fields are
confined to mass coordinates within the main sequence convective core, and the
observed sharp increase in dipole mode suppression rates above $1.5 \, M_\odot$
may be explained by the larger convective core masses and faster rotation of
these more massive stars. In clump stars, core fields of $\sim10^5 \, {\rm G}$
can suppress dipole modes, whose visibility should be equal to or less than the
visibility of suppressed modes in ascending red giants. High dipole mode
suppression rates in low-mass ($M \lesssim 2 \, M_\odot$) clump stars would
indicate that magnetic fields generated during the main sequence can withstand
subsequent convective phases and survive into the compact remnant phase.
Finally, we discuss implications for observed magnetic fields in white dwarfs
and neutron stars, as well as the effects of magnetic fields in various types

unprecedented resolution. Specifically, the proto-stellar masses of systems
such as CB230 IRS1 and L1165-SMM1 have been detected in the range of $0.1-0.25
\, M_{\odot}$. These are much more massive than the masses generally obtained
by numerical simulations of binary formation, around $0.01 \, M_{\odot}$.
Motivated by these discrepancies in mass, in this paper we study the formation
mass of a binary system as a function of the total mass of its parent core. To
achieve this objective, we present a set of numerical simulations of the
gravitational collapse of a uniform and rotating core, in which azimuthal
symmetric mass seeds are initially implemented in order to favor the formation
of a dense filament, out of which a binary system may be formed by direct
fragmentation. We first observed that this binary formation process is
diminished when the total mass of the parent core $M_0$ is increased; then we
increased the level of the ratio of kinetic energy to the gravitational energy,
denoted by $\beta$, initially supplied to the rotating core, in order to
achieve the desired direct fragmentation of the filament. Next, we found that
the mass of the binary fragment increases with the mass of the parent core, as
expected. In this paper we confirm this expectation and also measure the binary
mass $M_f$ obtained from an initial $M_0$. We then show a schematic diagram
$M_0$ vs $\beta$, where the desired binary configurations are located while the
ratio of the thermal energy to the gravitational energy $\alpha$ is kept fixed.
We also report some basic physical data of the proto-stellar fragments that
form the binary system, including the formation mass $M_f$, and its
corresponding $\alpha_f$ and $\beta_f$.

  Finally, suppose that n=2r, where r is an odd integer, and the rank of each

failed nodes within each repair group. But if the extreme cases occur that the
entire repair group has failed, the local code stored in the failed group need
to be recovered as a whole. In this paper, local codes with cooperative repair,
in which the local codes are constructed based on minimum storage regeneration
(MSR) codes, is proposed to achieve repairing the failed groups. Specifically,
the proposed local codes with cooperative repair construct a kind of mutual
interleaving structure among the parity symbols, that the parity symbols of
each local code, named as distributed local parity, can be generated by the
parity symbols of the MSR codes in its two adjacent local codes. Taking
advantage of the structure given, the failed local groups can be repaired
cooperatively by their adjacent local groups with lower repair locality, and
meanwhile the minimum distance of local codes with cooperative repair is
derived. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments show that, compared
with codes with local regeneration (such as MSR-local codes and MBR-local
codes), the proposed local codes with cooperative repair have benefits in
bandwidth overhead and repair locality for the case of local groups failure.

oscillates, decaying non-perturbatively into the rest of the SM species. The
resulting out-of-equilibrium dynamics converts a fraction of the energy
available into gravitational waves (GW). We study this process using classical
lattice simulations in an expanding box, following the energetically dominant
electroweak gauge bosons $W^\pm$ and $Z$. We characterize the GW spectrum as a
function of the running couplings, Higgs initial amplitude, and
post-inflationary expansion rate. As long as the SM is decoupled from the
inflationary sector, the generation of this background is universally expected,
independently of the nature of inflation. Our study demonstrates the efficiency
of GW emission by gauge fields undergoing parametric resonance. The initial
energy of the Higgs condensate represents however, only a tiny fraction of the
inflationary energy. Consequently, the resulting background is very suppressed,
with an amplitude $h^2 \Omega_{\rm GW}^{(o)} \lesssim 10^{-29}$ today. The
amplitude can be boosted to $h^2 \Omega_{\rm GW}^{(o)} \lesssim 10^{-16}$, if
following inflation the universe undergoes a kination-domination stage; however
the background is shifted in this case to high frequencies $f_p \lesssim
10^{11} {\rm Hz}$. In all cases the signal is out of the range of current or
planned GW detectors. This background will therefore remain, most likely, as a
curiosity of the SM.

Recent observations show that the Kepler lightcurves of some hot Jupiters are
asymmetric: for the hottest planets, the lightcurve peaks before secondary
eclipse, whereas for planets cooler than $\sim1900\rm\,K$, it peaks after
secondary eclipse. We use the thermal structure from 3D global circulation
models to determine the expected cloud distribution and Kepler lightcurves of
hot Jupiters. We demonstrate that the change from an optical lightcurve
dominated by thermal emission to one dominated by scattering (reflection)
naturally explains the observed trend from negative to positive offset. For the
cool planets the presence of an asymmetry in the Kepler lightcurve is a
telltale sign of the cloud composition, because each cloud species can produce
an offset only over a narrow range of effective temperatures. By comparing our
models and the observations, we show that the cloud composition of hot Jupiters
likely varies with equilibrium temperature. We suggest that a transition occurs
between silicate and manganese sulfide clouds at a temperature near
$1600\rm\,K$, analogous to the L/T transition on brown dwarfs. The cold
trapping of cloud species below the photosphere naturally produces such a
transition and predicts similar transitions for other condensates, including
TiO. We predict that most hot Jupiters should have cloudy nightsides, that
partial cloudiness should be common at the limb and that the dayside hot spot
should often be cloud-free.

separate users in the spatial domain, or indirectly, in order to improve the

systematic and comprehensive discussion of these two contradicting tendencies,
using the metacommunity version of the recently proposed time-average neutral
model of biodiversity which incorporates environmental stochasticity and
demographic noise and allows for extinction and speciation. We show that the
incorporation of demographic noise into the model is essential to its
applicability, yielding realistic behavior of the system when fitness
variations are relatively weak. The dependence of species richness on the
strength of environmental stochasticity changes sign when the correlation time

should produce diffuse gamma-ray emission due to their hadronic interactions
with the intra-cluster medium. The nearby Perseus cool-core cluster, identified
as the most promising target to search for such an emission, has been observed
with the MAGIC telescopes at very-high energies (VHE, E>100 GeV) for a total of
253 hr from 2009 to 2014. The active nuclei of NGC 1275, the central dominant
galaxy of the cluster, and IC 310, lying at about 0.6$^\circ$ from the centre,
have been detected as point-like VHE gamma-ray emitters during the first phase
of this campaign. We report an updated measurement of the NGC 1275 spectrum,
which is well described by a power law with a photon index of
$3.6\pm0.2_{stat}\pm0.2_{syst}$ between 90 GeV and 1.2 TeV. We do not detect
any diffuse gamma-ray emission from the cluster and set stringent constraints
on its CR population. In order to bracket the uncertainties over the CR spatial
and spectral distributions, we adopt different spatial templates and power-law
spectral indexes $\alpha$. For $\alpha=2.2$, the CR-to-thermal pressure within
the cluster virial radius is constrained to be below 1-2%, except if CRs can
propagate out of the cluster core, generating a flatter radial distribution and
releasing the CR-to-thermal pressure constraint to <20%. Assuming that the
observed radio mini-halo of Perseus is generated by secondary electrons from CR
hadronic interactions, we can derive lower limits on the central magnetic
field, $B_0$, that depend on the CR distribution. For $\alpha=2.2$,
$B_0\gtrsim5-8 \mu$G, which is below the 25 $\mu$G inferred from Faraday
rotation measurements, whereas, for $\alpha\lesssim2.1$, the hadronic
interpretation of the diffuse radio emission is in contrast with our gamma-ray
flux upper limits independently of the magnetic field strength.

by the crowd is often biased towards immediacy: what is happening now. Prompted
by the propagation of commentary and information through multiple mediums,
users on the Web interact with and produce new posts about newsworthy topics
and give rise to trending topics. This paper proposes to leverage on the
behavioral dynamics of users to estimate the most relevant time periods for a
topic. Our hypothesis stems from the fact that when a real-world event occurs
it usually has peak times on the Web: a higher volume of tweets, new visits and
edits to related Wikipedia articles, and news published about the event. In
this paper, we propose a novel time-aware ranking model that leverages on
multiple sources of crowd signals. Our approach builds on two major novelties.
First, a unifying approach that given query q, mines and represents temporal
evidence from multiple sources of crowd signals. This allows us to predict the
temporal relevance of documents for query q. Second, a principled retrieval
model that integrates temporal signals in a learning to rank framework, to rank
results according to the predicted temporal relevance. Evaluation on the TREC
2013 and 2014 Microblog track datasets demonstrates that the proposed model
achieves a relative improvement of 13.2% over lexical retrieval models and 6.2%

set in the context of a reduced model derived from the Boussinesq equations
that efficiently retains anisotropic inertia-gravity waves with order-one
frequencies and highlights a regime of wave-eddy interactions. Numerical
simulations of the reduced model are performed where energy is injected by a
stochastic forcing of vertical velocity, which forces wave modes only. The
simulations reveal two regimes characterized by the presence of well-formed,
persistent and thin turbulent layers of locally-weakened stratification at
small Froude numbers, and by the absence of layers at large Froude numbers.
Both regimes are characterized by a large-scale barotropic dipole enclosed by
small-scale turbulence. When the Reynolds number is not too large a direct
cascade of barotropic kinetic energy is observed, leading to total energy
equilibration. We examine net energy exchanges that occur through vortex
stretching and vertical buoyancy flux and diagnose the horizontal scales active
in these exchanges. We find that the baroclinic motions inject energy directly
to the largest scales of the barotropic mode, implying that the large-scale
barotropic dipole is not the end result of an inverse cascade within the

coding consists in studying the optimality of the classical upper bound
$\phi(G)\leq 2^{\tau}$, where $\tau$ is the minimum size of a feedback vertex
set of $G$. In this paper, we study the maximum number $\phi_m(G)$ of fixed
points in a {\em monotone} Boolean network with interaction graph $G$. We
establish new upper and lower bounds on $\phi_m(G)$ that depends on the cycle
structure of $G$. In addition to $\tau$, the involved parameters are the
maximum number $\nu$ of vertex-disjoint cycles, and the maximum number
$\nu^{*}$ of vertex-disjoint cycles verifying some additional technical
conditions. We improve the classical upper bound $2^\tau$ by proving that
$\phi_m(G)$ is at most the largest sub-lattice of $\{0,1\}^\tau$ without chain
of size $\nu+1$, and without another forbidden-pattern of size $2\nu^{*}$.
Then, we prove two optimal lower bounds: $\phi_m(G)\geq \nu+1$ and
$\phi_m(G)\geq 2^{\nu^{*}}$. As a consequence, we get the following
characterization: $\phi_m(G)=2^\tau$ if and only if $\nu^{*}=\tau$. As another
consequence, we get that if $c$ is the maximum length of a chordless cycle of

influential seeders to trigger substantial information spread in social
networks. In this paper, we consider a new and complementary problem of how to
further increase the influence spread of given seeders. Our study is motivated
by the observation that direct incentives could ""boost"" users so that they are
more likely to be influenced by friends. We study the $k$-boosting problem
which aims to find $k$ users to boost so that the final ""boosted"" influence
spread is maximized. The $k$-boosting problem is different from the IM problem
because boosted users behave differently from seeders: boosted users are
initially uninfluenced and we only increase their probability to be influenced.
Our work also complements the IM studies because we focus on triggering larger
influence spread on the basis of given seeders. Both the NP-hardness of the
problem and the non-submodularity of the objective function pose challenges to
the $k$-boosting problem. To tackle the problem on general graphs, we devise
two efficient algorithms with the data-dependent approximation ratio. For the
$k$-boosting problem on bidirected trees, we present an efficient greedy
algorithm and a rounded dynamic programming that is a fully polynomial-time
approximation scheme. We conduct extensive experiments using real social
networks and synthetic bidirected trees. We show that boosting solutions
returned by our algorithms achieves boosts of influence that are up to several
times higher than those achieved by boosting solutions returned by intuitive
baselines, which have no guarantee of solution quality. We also explore the
""budget allocation"" problem in our experiments. Compared with targeting seeders
with all budget, larger influence spread is achieved when we allocation the
budget to both seeders and boosted users.

remainders with respect to several moduli, namely the robust remaindering
problem, may occur in many applications including phase unwrapping, frequency
detection from several undersampled waveforms, wireless sensor networks, etc.
Assuming that the dynamic range of the large number is the maximal possible
one, i.e., the least common multiple (lcm) of all the moduli, a method called
robust Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) for solving the robust remaindering
problem has been recently proposed. In this paper, by relaxing the assumption
that the dynamic range is fixed to be the lcm of all the moduli, a trade-off
between the dynamic range and the robustness bound for two-modular systems is
studied. It basically says that a decrease in the dynamic range may lead to an
increase of the robustness bound. We first obtain a general condition on the
remainder errors and derive the exact dynamic range with a closed-form formula
for the robustness to hold. We then propose simple closed-form reconstruction
algorithms. Furthermore, the newly obtained two-modular results are applied to
the robust reconstruction for multi-modular systems and generalized to real
numbers. Finally, some simulations are carried out to verify our proposed
theoretical results.

components in novel applications for electronics and optoelectronics. However,
the charge transport behavior in 2D semiconductors is more susceptible to
external surroundings (e.g. gaseous adsorbates from air and trapped charges in
substrates) and their electronic performance is generally lower than
corresponding bulk materials due to the fact that surface and bulk coincide. In
this article, we review recent progress on the charge transport properties and
carrier mobility engineering of 2D transition metal chalcogenides, with a
particular focus on the markedly high dependence of carrier mobility on
thickness. We unveil the origin of this unique thickness dependence and
elaborate the devised strategies to master it for carrier mobility
optimization. Specifically, physical and chemical methods towards the
optimization of the major factors influencing the extrinsic transport such as
electrode/semiconductor contacts, interfacial Coulomb impurities and atomic
defects are discussed. In particular, the use of \textit{ad-hoc} molecules
makes it possible to engineer the interface with the dielectric and heal the
vacancies in such materials. By casting fresh light onto the theoretical and
experimental works, we provide a guide for improving the electronic performance
of the 2D semiconductors, with the ultimate goal of achieving technologically
viable atomically thin (opto)electronics.

are of the order of few years and a few decades for the red and asymptotic
giant branch stars, respectively. The planets will eventually be destroyed at a
separation from the core of the giants smaller than the resolution of our
simulations, either through evaporation or tidal disruption. As the planets
in-spiral, the giant stars' envelopes are somewhat puffed up. Based on
relatively long timescales and even considering the fact that further in-spiral
should take place before the planets are destroyed, we predict that the merger
would be difficult to observe, with only a relatively small, slow brightening.
Very little mass is unbound in the process. These conclusions may change if the
planet's orbit enhances the star's main pulsation modes. Based on the angular
momentum transfer, we also suspect that this star-planet interaction may be
unable to lead to large scale outflows via the rotation-mediated dynamo effect
of Nordhaus and Blackman. Detectable pollution from the destroyed planets would
only result for the lightest, lowest metallicity stars. We furthermore find
that in both simulations the planets move through the outer stellar envelopes
at Mach-3 to Mach-5, reaching Mach-1 towards the end of the simulations. The
gravitational drag force decreases and the in-spiral slows down at the sonic
transition, as predicted analytically.

A stronger magnetic field in the pre-shock region could provide the efficiency
required. Bell's cosmic-ray nonresonant streaming instability has been claimed
to be responsible for the amplification of precursor magnetic fields. However,
an alternative mechanism has been proposed in which the cosmic-ray pressure
gradient forms the shock precursor and drives turbulence, amplifying the
magnetic field via the small-scale dynamo. A key ingredient for the mechanism
to operate are the inhomogeneities present in the interstellar medium (ISM).
These inhomogeneities are the consequence of turbulence. In this work we
explore the magnetic field amplification in different ISM conditions through 3D
MHD numerical simulations.

unbound objects is $\sim85$% complete for $M>0.015\,M_\odot$ in low density
regions ($A_V\stackrel{<}{_\sim}5$ mag), while the bound (prestellar) subset is
$\sim85$% complete for $M>0.1\,M_\odot$ overall. The prestellar core mass
function (CMF) is consistent with lognormal form, resembling the stellar system
initial mass function, as has been reported previously. All of the inferred
prestellar cores lie on filamentary structures whose column densities exceed
the expected threshold for filamentary collapse, in agreement with previous
reports. Unlike the prestellar CMF, the unbound starless CMF is not lognormal,
but instead is consistent with a power-law form below $0.3\,M_\odot$ and shows
no evidence for a low-mass turnover. It resembles previously reported mass
distributions for CO clumps at low masses ($M\stackrel{<}{_\sim}0.3\,M_\odot$).
The volume density PDF, however, is accurately lognormal except at high
densities. It is consistent with the effects of self-gravity on magnetized
supersonic turbulence. The only significant deviation from lognormality is a
high-density tail which can be attributed unambiguously to prestellar cores.

Solar System - the Oort cloud of comets - within the framework of Milgromian
Dynamics (MD or MOND). For this purpose we built a numerical model of the cloud
assuming QUMOND, a modified gravity theory of MD. In the modified gravity
versions of MD, the internal dynamics of a system is influenced by the external
gravitational field in which the system is embedded, even when this external
field is constant and uniform, a phenomenon dubbed the external field effect
(EFE). Adopting the popular pair $\nu(x)=[1-\exp(-x^{1/2})]^{-1}$ for the MD
interpolating function and $a_{0}=1.2\times10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ for the MD
acceleration scale, we found that the observationally inferred Milgromian cloud
of comets is much more radially compact than its Newtonian counterpart. The
comets of the Milgromian cloud stay away from the zone where the Galactic tide
can torque their orbits significantly. However, this does not need to be an
obstacle for the injection of the comets into the inner solar system as the EFE
can induce significant change in perihelion distance during one revolution of a
comet around the Sun. Adopting constraints on different interpolating function
families and a revised value of $a_{0}$ (provided recently by the Cassini
spacecraft), the aforementioned qualitative results no longer hold, and, in
conclusion, the Milgromian cloud is very similar to the Newtonian in its
overall size, binding energies of comets and hence the operation of the
Jupiter-Saturn barrier. However, EFE torquing of perihelia still play a
significant role in the inner parts of the cloud. Consequently Sedna-like
orbits and orbits of large semi-major axis Centaurs are easily comprehensible
in MD. In MD, they both belong to the same population, just in different modes
of their evolution.

problem. One branch of defense research investigates the behavioral difference

observation is that a worm-infected host, which scans the Internet with
randomly selected addresses, has a much higher connection-failure rate than a

worms by traffic shaping based on connection failure rate. However, these

the dynamics of completely integrable or close to completely integrable
billiard tables, the integral geometry on them, and the spectrum of the
corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operators. It is concerned with new isospectral
invariants and with the spectral rigidity problem for families of
Laplace-Beltrami operators with Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin boundary
conditions, associated with C^1 families of billiard tables. We introduce a
notion of weak isospectrality for such deformations. The main dynamical
assumption on the initial billiard table is that the corresponding billiard
ball map or an iterate of it has a Kronecker invariant torus with a Diophantine
frequency and that the corresponding Birkhoff Normal Form is nondegenerate in
Kolmogorov sense. Then we obtain C^1 families of Kronecker tori with
Diophantine frequencies. If the family of the Laplace-Beltrami operators
satisfies the weak isospectral condition, we prove that the average action on
the tori and the Birkhoff Normal Form of the billiard ball maps remain the same
along the perturbation. As an application we obtain infinitesimal spectral
rigidity for Liouville billiard tables in dimensions two and three.
Applications are obtained also for strictly convex billiard tables of dimension
two as well as in the case when the initial billiard table admits an elliptic
periodic billiard trajectory. Spectral rigidity of billard tables close
elliptical billiard tables is obtained. The results are based on a construction
of C^1 families of quasi-modes associated with the Kronecker tori and on
suitable KAM theorems for C^1 families of Hamiltonians.

a bulk, i.e., three-dimensional (3D), Dirac semimetal (BDS). We obtain that at
frequencies lower than Fermi energy the metallic response in a BDS film
manifests in the existence of surface-plasmon polaritons, but at higher
frequencies the dielectric response is dominated and it occurs that a BDS film
behaves as a dielectric waveguide. At this dielectric regime we predict the
existence inside a BDS film of novel electromagnetic modes, a 3D analog of the
transverse electric waves in graphene. We also find that the dielectric
response manifests as the wide-angle passband in the mid-infrared (IR)
transmission spectrum of light incident on a BDS film, which can be used for
the interferenceless omnidirectional mid-IR filtering. The tuning of the Fermi
level of the system allows us to switch between the metallic and the dielectric
regimes and to change the frequency range of the predicted modes. This makes
BDSs promising materials for photonics and plasmonics.

cadence observations from the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard the Hinode
satellite in the Ca II H line filter obtained on 26 January 2007. The
observational technique provides the high spatio-temporal resolution required
to detect fine structures such as spicules. We apply Fourier power spectrum and
wavelet analysis to SOT/Hinode time series of an active region data to explore
the existence of coherent intensity oscillations. The presence of coherent
waves could be an evidence for energy transport to heat the solar atmosphere.
Using time series, we measure the phase difference between two intensity
profiles obtained at two different heights, which gives information about the
phase difference between oscillations at those heights as a function of
frequency. The results of a fast Fourier transform (FFT) show peaks in the
power spectrum at frequencies in the range from 2 to 8 mHz at four different
heights (above the limb), while the wavelet analysis indicate dominant
frequencies similar to those of the Fourier power spectrum results. A coherency
study indicates the presence of coherent oscillations at about 5.5 mHz (3 min).
We measure mean phase speeds in the range 250 to 425 km/s increasing with
height.

notion of inversion sets of roots, and a second one, combinatorial, that uses
comparisons of the minimal and maximal length representatives of the cosets.
These characterizations are then used to show that the facial weak order is in
fact a lattice, generalizing a well-known result of A. Bj\""orner for the
classical weak order. Finally, we show that any lattice congruence of the
classical weak order induces a lattice congruence of the facial weak order, and

describe the facial boolean lattice on the faces of the cube and the facial

combined use of color-kinematics duality and integrand reduction yields the
existence of relations between the integrand residues of partial amplitudes
with different orderings of the external particles. These relations can be
established for the cut-constructible contributions as well for the ones
responsible for rational terms. Starting from the general parametrization of
one-loop residues and applying Laurent expansion in order to extract the

surface gravity wave problem is known to provide results of reasonable accuracy
to engineers in estimating the phase speed and amplitudes of such nonlinear
waves. The weakling in this structure though is the presence of aperiodic
secular variation in the solution that does not agree with the known periodic
propagation of surface waves. This has historically necessitated increasingly
higher ordered (perturbative) approximations in the representation of the
velocity profile. The present article ameliorates this long standing
theoretical insufficiency by invoking a compact exact $n$-ordered solution in
the asymptotic infinite depth limit, primarily based on a representation
structured around the third ordered perturbative solution, that leads to a
seamless extension to higher order (e.g. fifth order) forms existing in the
literature. The result from this study is expected to improve phenomenological
engineering estimates, now that any desired higher ordered expansion may be
compacted within the same representation, but without any aperiodicity in the

the first measurement of the anisotropy parameter $\beta$ using 3D kinematics
outside of the solar neighborhood. We find $\beta=-0.3^{+0.4}_{-0.9}$,
consistent with isotropy and lower than solar neighborhood $\beta$ measurements

consistent with recent observational studies, and may indicate the presence of

[O II] emitter (EW$\sim200$ \AA). We mapped, for the first time, at high
resolution the kinematics of the [O III] and H$\alpha$ line complexes and
linked them with the [O II] emission. The high spatial resolution achieved
allowed us to resolve all the components of the SB-QSO system. Our analysis
with a resolution of few kpc reveals complexities and asymmetries in and around

reveals different kinematic components, with maximum blueshifted and redshifted
velocities up to $\simeq1300$ km s$^{-1}$, not spatially coincident with the

location can be explained by the presence of fast moving material. We also
spectroscopically confirm the presence of a merging system at the same redshift

  Methods. We present a uniform X-ray spectral analysis of the high energy
properties of 14 nearby megamaser Active Galactic Nuclei observed by NuSTAR. We
use a simple analytical model to localize the maser disk and understand its
connection with the torus by combining NuSTAR spectral parameters with
available physical quantities from VLBI mapping.
  Results. Most of the sources analyzed are heavily obscured, showing a column
density in excess of $\sim 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. In particular, $79\%$ are
Compton-thick ($N_{\rm H} > 1.5 \times 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$). Using column
densities measured by NuSTAR, with the assumption that the torus is the
extension of the maser disk, and further assuming a reasonable density profile,
the torus dimensions can be predicted. They are found to be consistent with
mid-IR interferometry parsec-scale observations of Circinus and NGC 1068. In
this picture, the maser disk is intimately connected to the inner part of the
torus. It is probably made of a large number of molecular clouds connecting the
torus and the outer part of the accretion disk, giving rise to a thin disk
rotating in most cases in Keplerian or sub-Keplerian motion. This toy model
explains the established close connection between water megamaser emission and
nuclear obscuration as a geometric effect.

neglected in the current generation of galaxy surveys. For future wide-angle

magnification due to relativistic aberration effects and the slope of the

these exhibit significant qualitative morphological differences between
cylindrical and disk-like cores. Specifically, if a disk-like core is observed

molecular column density profile is centrally peaked, depressed or flat. We

the absence of other multiplet members and/or transitions with the same upper

during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stage of evolution. To determine ionic
abundances, we calculate [Rb IV] collision strengths and use approximations for
those of [Cd IV] and [Ge VI]. Our identification of [Rb IV] 1.5973 $\mu$m is
supported by the agreement between Rb3+/H+ abundances found from this line and
the 5759.55 A feature in NGC 7027. Elemental Rb, Cd, and Ge abundances are
derived with ionization corrections based on similarities in ionization
potential ranges between the detected ions and O and Ne ionization states. Our
analysis indicates abundances 2-4 times solar for Rb and Cd in both nebulae. Ge
is subsolar in NGC 7027, but its abundance is uncertain due to the large and
uncertain ionization correction. The general consistency of the measured
relative s-process enrichments with predictions from models appropriate for
these PNe (2.0-2.5 M_sun, [Fe/H]= -0.37) demonstrates the potential of using PN

galaxies with a hot gaseous halo component each, and examine whether the merger
remnant can be a spiral galaxy. The stellar progenitor disks are destroyed by
violent relaxation during the merging and most of their stars form a classical
bulge, while the remaining form a thick disk and its bar. A new stellar disk
forms subsequently and gradually in the remnant from the gas accreted mainly
from the halo. It is vertically thin and well extended in its equatorial plane.
A bar starts forming before the disk is fully in place, contrary to what is
assumed in idealised simulations of isolated bar-forming galaxies. It has
morphological features such as ansae and boxy/peanut bulges. Stars of different
ages populate different parts of the box/peanut. A disky pseudobulge forms
also, so that by the end of the simulation, all three types of bulges coexist.
The oldest stars are found in the classical bulge, followed by those of the
thick disk, then by those in the thin disk. The youngest stars are in the
spiral arms and the disky pseudobulge. The disk surface density profiles are of
type II (exponential with downbending), and the circular velocity curves are
flat and show that the disks are submaximum in these examples: two clearly so
and one near-borderline between maximum and submaximum. On average, only
roughly between 10 and 20% of the stellar mass is in the classical bulge of the
final models, i.e. much less than in previous simulations.

last few years. Although BSPT states have been classified by various
approaches, there is so far no successful experimental realization of any BSPT
state in two or higher dimensions. In this paper, we propose that a two
dimensional BSPT state with $U(1) \times U(1)$ symmetry can be realized in
bilayer graphene in a magnetic field. Here the two $U(1)$ symmetries represent
total spin $S^z$ and total charge conservation respectively. The Coulomb
interaction plays a central role in this proposal -- it gaps out all the
fermions at the boundary, so that only bosonic charge and spin degrees of
freedom are gapless and protected at the edge. Based on the bosonic nature of
the boundary states, we derive the bulk wave function for the bosonic charge
and spin degrees of freedom, which takes exactly the same form as the desired
BSPT state. We also propose that the bulk quantum phase transition between the
BSPT and trivial phase, could become a ""bosonic phase transition"" with
interactions. That is, only bosonic modes close their gap at the transition,
which is fundamentally different from all the well-known topological insulator
to trivial insulator transitions which occur for free fermion systems. We
discuss various experimental consequences of this proposal.

state analogous to the $\eta'$ meson of QCD. Then we show the consequent
formation of a neutrino vacuum condensate, which effectively generates small
neutrino masses. Afterwards we outline several phenomenological consequences of
our neutrino mass generation model. The cosmological neutrino mass bound
vanishes since we predict the neutrinos to be massless until the phase
transition in the late Universe, $T\sim {\rm meV}$. Deviations from an equal
flavor rate due to enhanced neutrino decays in extraterrestrial neutrino fluxes
can be observed in future IceCube data. The current cosmological neutrino
background only consists of the lightest neutrinos, which, due to enhanced
neutrino-neutrino interactions, either bind up, form a superfluid, or
completely annihilate into massless bosons. Strongly coupled relic neutrinos
could provide a contribution to cold dark matter in the late Universe, together
with the new proposed particles and topological defects, which may have formed
during neutrino condensation. These enhanced interactions could also be a
source of relic neutrino clustering in our Galaxy, which possibly makes the
overdense cosmic neutrino background detectable in the KATRIN experiment. The
neutrino condensate provides a mass for the hypothetical $B-L$ gauge boson,
leading to a gravity-competing force detectable in short-distance measurements.
Gravitational waves detections have the potential to probe our neutrino mass

physics at distant times in the universe. They, therefore, have particular
relevance in answering the basic question as to whether the laws of physics are
invariant with time. The dimesionless fundamental constants, such as the proton
to electron mass ratio and the fine structure constant are key elements in the
investigation. If they vary with time then the answer is clearly that the laws
of physics are not invariant with time and significant new physics must be
developed to describe the universe. Limits on their variance, on the other
hand, constrains the parameter space available to new physics that requires a
variation with time of basic physical law. There are now observational
constraints on the time variation of the proton to electron mass ratio mu at
the 1.E-7 level. Constraints on the variation of the fine structure constant
alpha are less rigorous, 1E-5, but are imposed at higher redshift. The
implications of these limits on new cosmologies that require rolling scalar
fields has already had its first investigations. Here we address the
implications on basic particle physics. The proton to electron mass ratio is
obviously dependent on the particle physics parameters that set the mass of the
proton and the electron. To first order the ratio is dependent on a combination
of the Quantum Chromodynamic scale, the Yukawa couplings, and the Higgs Vacuum
Expectation Value. Here that relationship is quantitative defined for the first
time. When coupled with previous determinations of the relation of the fine
structure constant to the same parameters two constraints exist on the
fractional variation of these parameters with time. A third independent
constraint involving only the three parameters could set the stage for
constraints on their individual fractional variation.

constitute a new class of pulsating low-mass pre-white dwarf stars. We present
a detailed nonadiabatic pulsation study of such stars, employing full
evolutionary sequences of low-mass He-core pre-white dwarf models. We have
considered models in which element diffusion is accounted for and also models
in which it is neglected. We confirm and explore in detail a new instability
strip in the domain of low gravities and low effective temperatures of the
$T_{\rm eff}-\log g$ diagram, where low-mass pre-white dwarfs are currently
found. The destabilized modes are radial and nonradial $p$ and $g$ modes
excited by the $\kappa-\gamma$ mechanism acting mainly at the zone of the
second partial ionization of He, with non-negligible contributions from the
region of the first partial ionization of He and the partial ionization of H.
The computations with element diffusion are unable to explain the pulsations
observed in the two known pulsating pre-white dwarfs, suggesting that element
diffusion might be inhibited at these stages of the pre-white dwarf evolution.
Our nonadiabatic models without diffusion, on the other hand, naturally explain
the existence and range of periods of the pulsating pre-white dwarf star WASP
J1628$+$10B, although they fail to explain the pulsations of WASP J0247$-$25B,
the other known member of the class, indicating that the He abundance in the
driving region of this star might be substantially larger than predicted by our
models. Further discoveries of additional members of this new class of
pulsating stars and their analysis in the context of the theoretical background

Limited vaccine, time delays, and interaction (or coupling) of cities lead to
tradeoffs that impact the overall magnitude of the epidemic. These tradeoffs
mandate investigation of optimal strategies that minimize the severity of the
epidemic by prioritizing allocation of vaccine to specific subpopulations. We
use an SIR model to describe the disease dynamics of an epidemic which breaks
out in one city and spreads to another. We solve a master equation to determine
the resulting probability distribution of the final epidemic size. We then
identify tradeoffs between vaccine, time delay, and coupling, and we determine

in the structure and evolution of neutron stars. Recent works suggest nuclear
pasta has a high resistivity which could be explained by the presence of long
lived topological defects. The defects act as impurities that decrease thermal
and electrical conductivity of the pasta. [Purpose] To quantify how topological
defects affect transport properties of nuclear pasta and estimate this effect
using an impurity parameter $Q_{\text{imp}}$. [Methods] Contrast molecular
dynamics simulations of up to 409\,600 nucleons arranged in parallel nuclear
pasta slabs (perfect pasta) with simulations of pasta slabs connected by
topological defects (impure pasta). From these simulations compare the
viscosity and heat conductivity of perfect and impure pasta to obtain an
effective impurity parameter $Q_{\text{imp}}$ due to the presence of defects.
[Results] Both the viscosity and thermal conductivity calculated for both
perfect and impure pasta are anisotropic, peaking along directions
perpendicular to the slabs and reaching a minimum close to zero parallel to
them. In our 409\,600 nucleon simulation topological defects connecting slabs
of pasta reduce both the thermal conductivity and viscosity on average by about
37\%. We estimate an effective impurity parameter due to the defects of order
$Q_{\text{imp}}\sim30$. [Conclusions] Topological defects in the pasta phase of
nuclear matter have an effect similar to impurities in a crystal lattice. The
irregularities introduced by the defects reduce the thermal and electrical
conductivities and the viscosity of the system. This effect can be
parameterized by a large impurity parameter $Q_{\text{imp}}\sim30$.

the WIMP wind apparent orientation and the direction of parallel carbon
nanotube axes must be properly chosen. We focus on very low ion recoil kinetic
energies, related to low mass WIMPs (~ 10 GeV) where most of the existing

a Galactic-scale view of the earliest stages of star formation. For this reason
Peretto & Fuller (2009) built an unbiased sample of IRDCs in the 10 deg < |l| <
65 deg, |b|<1 deg region of the Galactic plane using Spitzer 8micron
extinction. However, in absorption studies, intrinsic fluctuations in the
mid-infrared background can be mis-interpreted as foreground clouds. The main
goal of the study presented here is to disentangle real clouds in the Spitzer
Dark Cloud (SDC) catalogue from artefacts due to fluctuations in the
mid-infrared background. We constructed H_2 column density maps at ~18""
resolution using the 160micron and 250micron data from the Herschel Galactic
plane survey Hi-GAL. We also developed an automated detection scheme that
confirms the existence of a SDC through its association with a peak on these
Herschel column density maps. Detection simulations, along with visual
inspection of a small sub-sample of SDCs, have been performed to get better
insight into the limitations of our automated identification scheme. Our
analysis shows that 76(+/-19)% of the catalogued SDCs are real. This fraction
drops to 55(+/-12)% for clouds with angular diameters larger than ~1 arcminute.
The contamination of the PF09 catalogue by large spurious sources reflect the
large uncertainties associated to the construction of the 8micron background
emission, a key stage towards the identification of SDCs. A comparison of the
Herschel confirmed SDC sample with the BGPS and ATLASGAL samples shows that
SDCs probe a unique range of cloud properties, reaching down to more compact
and lower column density clouds than any of these two (sub-)millimetre Galactic
plane surveys.

rotation measures (RMs) of extragalactic linearly-polarized fast radio bursts

filaments of galaxies. The DM through the cosmic web is dominated by
contributions from the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) in filaments and
from the gas in voids. On the other hand, RM is induced mostly by the hot
medium in galaxy clusters, and only a fraction of it is produced in the WHIM.
We show that if one excludes FRBs whose sightlines pass through galaxy
clusters, the line-of-sight strength of the IGMF in filaments, $B_{||}$, is
approximately $C(\langle 1+z \rangle/f_{DM})(RM/DM)$, where $C$ is a known
constant. Here, the redshift of the FRB is not required to be known; $f_{DM}$
is the fraction of total DM due to the WHIM, while $\langle 1+z \rangle$ is the
redshift of interevening gas weighted by the WHIM gas density, both of which
can be evaluated for a given cosmology model solely from the DM of an FRB.
Using data on structure formation simulations and a model IGMF, we show that
$C(\langle 1+z \rangle/f_{DM})(RM/DM)$ closely reproduces the density-weighted
line-of-sight strength of the IGMF in filaments of the large-scale structure.

entails a notion of nonintegrability: a generic general relativistic model, at
least when coupled to cosmologically interesting matter, likely possesses
neither differentiable Dirac observables nor a reduced phase space. It follows
that the standard notion of observable has to be extended to include
non-differentiable or even discontinuous generalized observables. These cannot
carry Poisson-algebraic structures and do not admit a standard quantization;
one thus faces a quantum representation problem of gravitational observables.
This has deep consequences for a quantum theory of gravity, which we
investigate in a simple model for a system with Hamiltonian constraint that
fails to be completely integrable. We show that basing the quantization on
standard topology precludes a semiclassical limit and can even prohibit any
solutions to the quantum constraints. Our proposed solution to this problem is
to refine topology such that a complete set of Dirac observables becomes
continuous. In the toy model, it turns out that a refinement to a polymer-type
topology, as e.g. used in loop gravity, is sufficient. Basing quantization of
the toy model on this finer topology, we find a complete set of quantum Dirac
observables and a suitable semiclassical limit. This strategy is applicable to
realistic candidate theories of quantum gravity and thereby suggests a solution
to a long-standing problem which implies ramifications for the very concept of
quantization. Our work reveals a qualitatively novel facet of chaos in physics
and opens up a new avenue of research on chaos in gravity which hints at deep
insights into the structure of quantum gravity.

promises to return the entire initial investment through cash withdrawals
during the contract plus the remaining account balance at maturity, regardless
of the portfolio performance. Under the optimal(dynamic) withdrawal strategy of
a policyholder, GMWB pricing becomes an optimal stochastic control problem that
can be solved by backward recursion of Bellman equation. In this paper we
develop a very efficient new algorithm for pricing these contracts in the case
of stochastic interest rate not considered previously in the literature.
Presently our method is applied to the Vasicek interest rate model, but it is
generally applicable to any model when transition density or moments of the
underlying asset and interest rate are known in closed form or can be evaluated
efficiently. Using bond price as a numeraire the required expectations in the
backward recursion are reduced to two-dimensional integrals calculated through
a high order Gauss-Hermite quadrature applied on a two-dimensional cubic spline
interpolation. Numerical results from the new algorithm for a series of GMWB
contracts for both static and optimal cases are presented. As a validation,
results of the algorithm are compared with the closed form solutions for simple
vanilla options, and with Monte Carlo and finite difference results for the
static GMWB. The comparison demonstrates that the new algorithm is
significantly faster than finite difference or Monte Carlo for all the
two-dimensional problems tested so far. For dynamic GMWB pricing, we found that
for positive correlation between the underlying asset and interest rate, the
GMWB price under the stochastic interest rate is significantly higher compared
to the case of deterministic interest rate, while for negative correlation the
difference is less but still significant.

magnetic field lines by a rapidly-spinning black hole (dubbed the black hole
Meissner effect) would shut down the Blandford-Znajek process and quench the
jets of active galactic nuclei and microquasars. This effect is however not
seen observationally or in numerical simulations. Previous attempts at
reconciling the predictions with observations have proposed several mechanisms
to evade the Meissner effect. In this paper, we identify a new evasion
mechanism and discuss its observational significance. Specifically, we show
that the breakdown of stationarity is sufficient to remove the expulsion of the
magnetic field at all multipole orders, and that the associated temporal
variation is likely turbulent due to the existence of efficient mechanisms for
sharing energy across different modes. Such an intrinsic (as opposed to being
driven externally by, e.g., changes in the accretion rate) variability of the
electromagnetic field can produce the recorded linear correlation between
microvariability amplitudes and mean fluxes, help create magnetic randomness
and seed sheared magnetic loops in jets, and lead to a better theoretical fit
to the X-ray microvariability power spectral density.

decoherence is to encode information in the ground subspace (or the low energy
sector) of a Hamiltonian with a large energy gap which penalizes errors from
environment. The protecting Hamiltonian is chosen such that its degenerate
ground subspace is an error detecting code for the errors caused by the
interaction with the environment. We consider environments with arbitrary
number of local sites, e.g. spins, whose interactions among themselves are
local and bounded. Then, assuming the system is interacting with a finite
number of sites in the environment, we prove that, up to second order with
respect to the coupling constant, decoherence and relaxation are suppressed by
a factor which grows exponentially fast with the ratio of energy penalty to the
norm of local interactions in the environment. The state may, however, still
evolve unitarily inside the code subspace due to the Lamb shift effect. In the
context of adiabatic quantum computation, this means that the evolution inside
the code subspace is effectively governed by a renormalized Hamiltonian. The
result is derived from first principles, without use of master equations or
their assumptions, and holds even in the infinite temperature limit. We also
prove that unbounded or non-local interactions in the environment at sites far
from the system do not considerably modify the exponential suppression. Our
main technical tool is a new bound on the decay of power spectral density at
high frequencies for local observables and many-body Hamiltonians with bounded

exfoliable. The bulk electrical transport and thermodynamic properties indicate
Fermi liquid behavior at low temperature for both compounds. Quantum
oscillations are observed in magnetization measurements for fields applied
parallel but not perpendicular to the $c$-axis, suggesting that the Fermi
surfaces are quasi-two dimensional. Frequencies are determined from quantum
oscillations for several parts of the Fermi surfaces. Lifshitz-Kosevich fits to
the temperature dependent amplitudes of the oscillations reveal small effective

agreement with quantum oscillation results and illustrate the effect of a
stronger spin-orbit interaction going from Zr to Hf. These results suggest that

further assume that the non-linearity in the ConvNet is Rectified Linear Unit
(ReLU) and the reference distribution is Gaussian white noise, then we obtain a
generative ConvNet model that is unique among energy-based models: The model is
piecewise Gaussian, and the means of the Gaussian pieces are defined by an
auto-encoder, where the filters in the bottom-up encoding become the basis
functions in the top-down decoding, and the binary activation variables
detected by the filters in the bottom-up convolution process become the
coefficients of the basis functions in the top-down deconvolution process. The
Langevin dynamics for sampling the generative ConvNet is driven by the
reconstruction error of this auto-encoder. The contrastive divergence learning
of the generative ConvNet reconstructs the training images by the auto-encoder.

Their goal is to harness human intelligence to solve computational problems

the system and make high efforts. This article surveys the field of HCSs from
the perspective of incentives and mechanism design. We first review
state-of-the-art HCSs, focusing on how incentives are provided to users. We
then use mechanism design to theoretically analyze different incentives. We
survey the mechanisms derived from state-of-the-art HCSs as well as classic
mechanisms that have been used in HCSs. Finally, we discuss eight promising

steepening across the relic width and power-law-like integrated spectrum can be
adequately explained by diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) model, in which
relativistic electrons are (re-)accelerated at shock waves induced in the
intracluster medium. However, the steep spectral curvature in the integrated
spectrum above $\sim 2$ GHz detected in some radio relics such as the Sausage
relic in cluster CIZA J2242.8+5301 may not be interpreted by simple radiative
cooling of postshock electrons. In order to understand such steepening, we here
consider a model in which a spherical shock sweeps through and then exits out
of a finite-size cloud with fossil relativistic electrons. The ensuing
integrated radio spectrum is expected to steepen much more than predicted for
aging postshock electrons, since the re-acceleration stops after the
cloud-crossing time. Using DSA simulations that are intended to reproduce radio
observations of the Sausage relic, we show that both the integrated radio
spectrum and the surface brightness profile can be fitted reasonably well, if a
shock of speed, $u_s \sim 2.5-2.8\times 10^3 \kms$, and sonic Mach number, $M_s
\sim 2.7-3.0$, traverses a fossil cloud for $\sim 45$ Myr and the postshock
electrons cool further for another $\sim 10$ Myr. This attempt illustrates that
steep curved spectra of some radio gischt relics could be modeled by adjusting
the shape of the fossil electron spectrum and adopting the specific

account for the high $T_c\sim 70$ K observed in these systems through the
conventional phonon-mediated pairing mechanism. In all of these systems,
however, we find that the coupling constant of a polar oxygen branch peaks at
$\mathbf{q}=0$ with negligible coupling elsewhere, while the energy of this
mode coincides with the offset energy of the replica bands measured recently by
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. But the integrated
coupling strength for this mode from our current calculations is still too
small to produce the observed high $T_c$, even through the more efficient
pairing mechanism provided by the forward scattering. We arrive at the same
qualitative conclusion when considering a checkerboard antiferromagnetic
configuration in the Fe layer. In light of the experimental observations of the
replica band feature and the relatively high $T_c$ of FeSe monolayers on polar
substrates, our results point towards a cooperative role for the
electron-phonon interaction, where the cross-interface interaction acts in
conjunction with a purely electronic interaction. We also discuss a few

sodium overabundance at the surface of red giants more massive than ~ 1.5--2.0
Msun. The surface aluminium abundance should not be affected. Nevertheless,
observational results disagree about the presence and/or the degree of the Na
and Al overabundances. In addition, Galactic chemical evolution models adopting
different stellar yields lead to quite different predictions for the behavior
of [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe] versus [Fe/H]. Overall, the observed trends of these
abundances with metallicity are not well reproduced. We readdress both issues,
using new Na and Al abundances determined within the Gaia-ESO Survey, using two
samples: i) more than 600 dwarfs of the solar neighborhood and of open clusters
and ii) low- and intermediate-mass clump giants in six open clusters.
Abundances of Na in giants with mass below ~2.0 Msun, and of Al in giants below
~3.0 Msun, seem to be unaffected by internal mixing processes. For more massive
giants, the Na overabundance increases with stellar mass. This trend agrees
well with predictions of stellar evolutionary models. Chemical evolution models
that are able to fit well the observed [Na/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] trend in solar
neighborhood dwarfs can not simultaneously explain the run of [Al/Fe] with
[Fe/H], and viceversa. The comparison with stellar ages is hampered by severe
uncertainties. Indeed, reliable age estimates are available for only a half of
the stars of the sample. We conclude that Al is underproduced by the models,
except for stellar ages younger than about 7 Gyr. In addition, some significant
source of late Na production seems to be missing in the models. Either current
Na and Al yields are affected by large uncertainties, and/or some important
Galactic source(s) of these elements has not been taken into account up to now.

the presence of a constant Higgs field that permeates all of space. The vacuum
expectation value (VEV) of this field is affected by quantum corrections which
are mainly generated by the self-interactions and couplings of the Higgs field
to gauge bosons and heavy quarks. In this work we show that gravity can affect,
in a non-trivial way, these quantum corrections through the finite parts of the
one-loop contributions to the effective potential. In particular, we consider
the corrections generated by the Standard Model Higgs self-interactions in
slowly-varying weak gravitational backgrounds. The obtained results amount to
the existence of non-negligible inhomogeneities in the Higgs VEV. Such
inhomogeneities translate into spatial variations of the particle masses, and
in particular of the proton-to-electron mass ratio. We find that these Higgs
perturbations in our Solar System are controlled by the Eddington parameter,
and are absent in pure General Relativity. Yet, they may be present in modified
gravity theories. This predicted effect may be constrained by atomic clocks or
high-resolution spectroscopic measurements, which could allow to improve
current limits on modifications of Einstein's gravity.

\omega \delta(z)$ where $n\in (\frac{3}{2},3),\; \omega > 0$ and $\delta$ is
the Dirac mass at the origin. It is known that the leading order expansion near
the edge of the support coincides with that of a traveling-wave solution for
the standard thin-film equation: $h_t=-(h^nh_{zzz})_z$. In this paper we
sharpen this result, proving that the higher order corrections are analytic
with respect to three variables: the first one is just the {spatial} variable,
whereas the second and the third (except for $n = 2$) are irrational powers of
it. It is known that this third variable does not appear for the thin-film
equation without gravity.

solution of a low-order version of the full model involving only a mean

approximate formula for the enhanced gravity by utilizing the hydrostatic
pressure assumption in the bed normal direction. Numerical calculations are
conducted for several test cases involving steep slopes. Comparison with a

indistinguishable, point-shaped robots on a two dimensional grid in
asymptotically optimal time $\mathcal{O}(n)$ in the fully synchronous
$\mathcal{FSYNC}$ time model. Given an arbitrarily distributed (yet connected)
swarm of robots, the gathering problem on the grid is to locate all robots
within a $2\times 2$-sized area that is not known beforehand. Two robots are
connected if they are vertical or horizontal neighbors on the grid. The
locality constraint means that no global control, no compass, no global
communication and only local vision is available; hence, a robot can only see
its grid neighbors up to a constant $L_1$-distance, which also limits its
movements. A robot can move to one of its eight neighboring grid cells and if
two or more robots move to the same location they are \emph{merged} to be only
one robot. The locality constraint is the significant challenging issue here,
since robot movements must not harm the (only globally checkable) swarm
connectivity. For solving the gathering problem, we provide a synchronous
algorithm -- executed by every robot -- which ensures that robots merge without
breaking the swarm connectivity. In our model, robots can obtain a special
state, which marks such a robot to be performing specific connectivity
preserving movements in order to allow later merge operations of the swarm.
Compared to the grid, for gathering in the Euclidean plane for the same robot
and time model the best known upper bound is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.

acceleration with the matter domination era, and the second model unifies all
the evolution eras of our Universe. The two models are described in the same
way at early and late times, and only the intermediate stages of the evolution
have some differences. Each cosmological model contains two Type IV
singularities which are chosen to occur one at the end of the inflationary era
and one at the end of the matter domination era. The cosmological models at
early times are approximately identical to the $R^2$ inflation model, so these
describe a slow-roll inflationary era which ends when the slow-roll parameters
become of order one. The inflationary era is followed by the radiation era and
after that the matter domination era follows, which lasts until the second Type
IV singularity, and then the late-time acceleration era follows. The models
produce a nearly scale invariant power spectrum of primordial curvature
perturbations and a scalar-to-tensor ratio which are compatible with the most
recent observational data and it seems that the deceleration acceleration
transition is crucially affected by the presence of the second Type IV
singularity which occurs at the end of the matter domination era. We perform an

tank-treading motion, on its surrounding shear flow by studying the induced
disturbance field $\delta \vec{V}$, the difference between the velocity field
in its presence and absence. The comparison between experiments and numerical
simulations reveals an impressive agreement. Tracking ridges in the disturbance
field magnitude landscape, we identify the principal directions along which the
velocity difference field is analysed in the vesicle vicinity. The disturbance
magnitude is found to be significant up to about 4 vesicles radii and can be
described by a power law decay with the distance $d$ from the vesicle $ \|
\delta \vec{V} \| \propto d^{-3/2}$. This is consistent with previous
experimental results on the separation distance between two interacting
vesicles under similar conditions, for which their dynamics is altered. This is
an indication of vesicles long-range effect via the disturbance field and calls
for the proper incorporation of long-range hydrodynamic interactions when

connected to known hard problems in graph theory (e.g. multiway cuts) and thus
requires an efficient heuristic. We formulate the basis discovery task as a

as a regularized eigenvalue computation. Moreover, we propose several
strategies in order to scale our algorithm to large graphs. Experimental

accreting young stars based on fully compressible time implicit
multi-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations. One major motivation is to analyse
the validity of accretion treatment used in previous 1D stellar evolution
studies. We analyse the effect of accretion on the structure of a realistic
stellar model of the young Sun. Our work is inspired by the numerical work of
Kley \& Lin (1996, ApJ, 461, 933) devoted to the structure of the boundary
layer in accretion disks. We analyse the redistribution of accreted material
with a range of values of specific entropy relative to the bulk specific
entropy of the material in the accreting object's convective envelope. A
primary goal is to understand whether and how accreted energy deposited onto a
stellar surface is redistributed in the interior. This study focusses on the
high accretion rates characteristic of FU Ori systems. We find that the highest
entropy cases produce a distinctive behaviour in the mass redistribution, rms
velocities, and enthalpy flux in the convective envelope. This change in
behaviour is characterised by the formation of a hot layer on the surface of
the accreting object, which tends to suppress convection in the envelope. We
analyse the long-term effect of such a hot buffer zone on the structure and
evolution of the accreting object with 1D stellar evolution calculations. We
study the relevance of the assumption of redistribution of accreted energy into
the stellar interior used in the literature. One conclusion is that, for a
given amount of accreted energy transferred to the accreting object, a
treatment assuming accretion energy redistribution throughout the stellar
interior could significantly overestimate the effects on the stellar structure,
in particular, on the resulting expansion.

transmitters (CSIT). Our achievement in contrast to popular $K-$user
interference alignment (IA) scheme has more practical notions. In this case
every receiver is equipped with one reconfigurable antenna which tries to place
its desired signal in a subspace which is linearly independent from
interference signals. We show that if the channel values are known to the
receivers only, the sum degrees-of-freedom (DOF) rate region of the linear BIA
with staggered antenna switching is $\frac{Kr}{r^2-r+K}$, where $r = \left
\lceil{\frac{\sqrt{1+4K}-1}{2}} \right \rceil$. The result indicates that the
optimum DoF rate region of the $K-$user interference channel is to achieve the
DoF of $\frac{\sqrt{K}}{2}$ for an asymptotically large network. Thus, the DoF
of the $K$-user interference channel using staggered antenna switching grows
sub-linearly with the number of the users, whereas it grows linearly in the
case where transmitters access the CSI. In addition we propose both
achievability and converse proof so as to show that this is the DoF rate region

  that enables search","Submitted to Algorithmica special issue of CPM2015",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, Marcus et al. (Bioinformatics 2014) proposed to use a compressed de
Bruijn graph to describe the relationship between the genomes of many
individuals/strains of the same or closely related species. They devised an
$O(n \log g)$ time algorithm called splitMEM that constructs this graph
directly (i.e., without using the uncompressed de Bruijn graph) based on a
suffix tree, where $n$ is the total length of the genomes and $g$ is the length
of the longest genome. In this paper, we present a construction algorithm that
outperforms their algorithm in theory and in practice. Moreover, we propose a
new space-efficient representation of the compressed de Bruijn graph that adds
the possibility to search for a pattern (e.g. an allele - a variant form of a
gene) within the pan-genome.

two and three dimensional magnetism, with a square lattice of $S=\frac{1}{2}$
Cu$^{2+}$ ions. We have used inelastic neutron scattering to investigate the
spin wave excitations of the system, to find out how they evolve as a function
of temperature, as well as to obtain information about the magnetic exchange
interactions. We observed well defined dispersive spin wave modes at $6$~K,
which partially survive above the magnetic ordering temperature, $T_N=24$~K.
Linear spin wave theory is used to determine the exchange interactions
revealing them to be highly two-dimensional in nature. Density functional
theory calculations are presented supporting this experimental finding, which
is in contrast to a previous \emph{ab-initio} study of the magnetic
interactions. Our analysis confirms that not the nearest neighbour, but the
next nearest neighbour interactions in the tetragonal $ab$ plane are the
strongest. Low incident energy measurements reveal the opening of a
$0.6(1)$~meV gap below $T_N$, which suggests the presence of a very weak single
ion anisotropy term in the form of an easy axis along $\hat{\mathbf{a}}$.

length of the periodic structure (2.2 pc) we estimated the gas kinematic
viscosity and the turbulence dissipation scale (0.1 pc) that is compatible with
that expected if ambipolar diffusion is the main mechanism of energy
dissipation in the WNM. The small-scale structures of the nebula are typical of
that seen in some molecular clouds. The gas density has a log-normal
distribution with an average value of $10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. The size of the
structures is 0.1-0.2 pc but this estimate is limited by the resolution of the
observations. The mass ranges from 0.2 to 20 M$_{\odot}$ and the distribution
of the more massive clumps follows a power law $dN/d\log(M) \sim M^{-1.4}$. We
identify a mass-size relation with the same exponent as that found in GMCs

  giant monocots",,,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Leaves are the organs that intercept light and create photosynthesis.
Efficient light interception is provided by leaves oriented orthogonal to most
of the sun rays. Except in the polar regions, this means orthogonal to the
direction of acceleration due to gravity, or simply horizontal. The leaves of
almost all terrestrial plants grow in a gravity field that tends to bend them
downward and therefore may counteract light interception. Plants thus allocate
biomass for self-support in order to maintain their leaves horizontal. To
compete with other species (inter-species competition), as well as other
individuals within the same species (intra-species competition), self-support
must be achieved with the least biomass produced. This study examines to what
extent leaves are designed to self-support. We show here that a basic
mechanical model provides the optimal dimensions of a leaf for light
interception and self-support. These results are compared to measurements made
on leaves of various giant monocot species,especially palm trees and banana
trees. The comparison between experiments and model predictions shows that the
longer palms are optimally designed for self-support whereas shorter leaves are
shaped predominantly by other parameters of selection.

considered before. The d=7 operators generate Majorana neutrino mass terms
either at tree-level, 1-loop or 2-loop level. We systematically compare
constraints derived from the mass mechanism to those derived from the
long-range double beta decay amplitude and classify our list of models
accordingly. We also study one particular example decomposition, which produces
neutrino masses at 2-loop level, can fit oscillation data and yields a large

strength and inclination of photospheric magnetic field, and on the parameters

use three simultaneous datasets obtained at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope
(Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife): (1) spectra of BaII 4554 A line registered
with the instrument TESOS to measure the variations of intensity and velocity
through the photosphere up to the temperature minimum; (2) spectropolarimetric
data in FeI 1.56 $\mu$m lines (registered with the instrument TIP II) to
measure photospheric magnetic fields; (3) filtergrams in CaIIH that give
information about brightness fluctuations in the chromosphere. The results show
that the CaIIH brightness in the facula strongly depends on the power of waves
with periods in the 5-min range, that propagate upwards, and also on the phase
shift between velocity oscillations at the bottom photosphere and around the
temperature minimum height, measured from BaII line. The CaIIH brightness is
maximum at locations where the phase shift between temperature and velocity
oscillations lies within 0-100 degrees. There is an indirect influence of
convective motions on the CaIIH brightness. Namely, the higher is the amplitude
of convective velocities and the larger is the height where they change their
direction of motion, the brighter is the facula. Altogether, our results lead
to conclusions that facular regions appear bright not only because of the
Wilson depression in magnetic structures, but also due to real heating.

a joint distribution for eigenvalues $P(\lambda_1,\cdots,\lambda_N)$. The study
of the distribution of linear statistics, i.e. of quantities of the form
$L=(1/N)\sum_if(\lambda_i)$ where $f(x)$ is a given function, appears in many
physical problems. In the $N\to\infty$ limit, $L$ scales as $L\sim N^\eta$,
where the scaling exponent $\eta$ depends on the ensemble and the function $f$.
Its distribution can be written under the form $P_N(s=N^{-\eta}\,L)\simeq
A_{\beta,N}(s)\,\exp\big\{-(\beta N^2/2)\,\Phi(s)\big\}$, where
$\beta\in\{1,\,2,\,4\}$ is the Dyson index. The Coulomb gas technique naturally
provides the large deviation function $\Phi(s)$, which can be efficiently
obtained thanks to a ""thermodynamic identity"" introduced earlier. We conjecture
the pre-exponential function $A_{\beta,N}(s)$. We check our conjecture on
several well controlled cases within the Laguerre and the Jacobi ensembles.
Then we apply our main result to a situation where the large deviation function
has no minimum (and $L$ has infinite moments)~: this arises in the statistical
analysis of the Wigner time delay for semi-infinite multichannel disordered
wires (Laguerre ensemble). The statistical analysis of the Wigner time delay
then crucially depends on the pre-exponential function $A_{\beta,N}(s)$, which
ensures the decay of the distribution for large argument.

biased tip of a scanning force microscope. Using a channel defined by a pair of
Schottky gates, the branched electron flow of ballistic electrons injected from
a quantum point contact is guided by potentials of a tunable height well below
the Fermi energy. The transition from injection into an open two-dimensional
electron gas to a strongly confined channel exhibits three experimentally
distinct regimes: one in which branches spread unrestrictedly, one in which
branches are confined but the background conductance is affected very little,
and one where the branches have disappeared and the conductance is strongly
modified. Classical trajectory-based simulations explain these regimes at the
microscopic level. These experiments allow us to understand under which
conditions branches observed in scanning gate experiments do or do not reflect
the flow of electrons.

find the optimal spanwise-wavy surface for suppression of cylinder wake
instability. Second-order perturbations are required to capture the stabilizing
effect of spanwise waviness, which is ignored by standard adjoint-based
sensitivity analyses. Here, previous methods are extended so that (i) 2nd-order
sensitivity is formulated for base flow changes satisfying linearised
Navier-Stokes, and (ii) the resulting method is applicable to a 2D global
instability problem. This makes it possible to formulate 2nd-order sensitivity
to shape modifications. Using this formulation, we find the optimal shape to
suppress the a cylinder wake instability. The optimal shape is then perturbed
by random distributions in full 3D stability analysis to confirm that it is a
local optimal at the given amplitude and wavelength. Furthermore, it is shown
that none of the 10 random wavy shapes alone stabilize the wake flow at Re=50,
while the optimal shape does. At Re=100, surface waviness of maximum height 1%
of the cylinder diameter is sufficient to stabilize the flow. The optimal
surface creates streaks by passively extracting energy from the base flow
derivatives and effectively altering the tangential velocity component at the
wall, as opposed to spanwise-wavy suction which inputs energy to the normal
velocity component at the wall. This paper presents a fully two-dimensional and
computationally affordable method to find optimal 2nd-order perturbations of
generic flow instability problems and any boundary control (such as boundary
forcing, shape modulation or suction).

to estimate the value of the ratio $\eta=\Psi/\Phi$ between the two scalar
potentials in the linear perturbed Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker
metric.[...] Complementary kinematic and lensing mass profiles were derived
from exhaustive analyses using the data from the Cluster Lensing And Supernova
survey with Hubble (CLASH) and the spectroscopic follow-up with the Very Large
Telescope (CLASH-VLT). Whereas the kinematic mass profile tracks only the
time-time part of the perturbed metric (i.e. only $\Phi$), the lensing mass
profile reflects the contribution of both time-time and space-space components
(i.e. the sum $\Phi+\Psi$). We thus express $\eta$ as a function of the mass
profiles and perform our analysis over the radial range $0.5\,Mpc\le r\le
r_{200}=1.96\,Mpc$. Using a spherical Navarro-Frenk-White mass profile, which
well fits the data, we obtain $\eta(r_{200})=1.01\,_{-0.28}^{+0.31}$ at the
68\% C.L. We discuss the effect of assuming different functional forms for mass
profiles and of the orbit anisotropy in the kinematic reconstruction.
Interpreting this result within the well-studied $f(R)$ modified gravity model,
the constraint on $\eta$ translates into an upper bound to the interaction
length (inverse of the scalaron mass) smaller than 2 Mpc. This tight constraint
on the $f(R)$ interaction range is however substantially relaxed when
systematic uncertainties in the analysis are considered. Our analysis
highlights the potential of this method to detect deviations from general
relativity, while calling for the need of further high-quality data on the
total mass distribution of clusters and improved control on systematic effects.

Based on an invasive, photometric measurement principle that drastically
reduces the volume of the blood sample needed from the patient, we present a
framework that is capable of dealing with small blood samples, while
maintaining the required accuracy. The framework consists of two major parts:
1) image segmentation; and 2) convergence detection. Step 1) is based on
iterative mode-seeking methods to estimate the intensity value of the region of
interest. We present several variations of these methods and give theoretical
proofs of their convergence. Our approach is able to deal with changes in the
number and position of clusters without any prior knowledge. Furthermore, we
propose a method based on sparse approximation to decrease the computational
load, while maintaining accuracy. Step 2) is achieved by employing temporal
tracking and prediction, herewith decreasing the measurement time, and, thus,
improving usability. Our framework is validated on several real data sets with
different characteristics. We show that we are able to estimate the underlying
glucose concentration from much smaller blood samples than is currently
state-of-the- art with sufficient accuracy according to the most recent ISO

that for pi^0 (eta, eta^\prime) the region of photon momenta below about 1
(1.5) GeV gives the main contribution to hadronic light-by-light scattering. We
then discuss how the precision of current and future measurements of the
single- and double-virtual transition form factor in different momentum regions
impacts the precision of a data-driven estimate of this contribution to
hadronic light-by-light scattering. Based on Monte Carlo simulations for a
planned first measurement of the double-virtual form factor at BESIII, we find
that for the pi^0, eta, eta^\prime-pole contributions a precision of 14\%,
23\%, 15\% seems feasible. Further improvements can be expected from other
experimental data and also from the use of dispersion relations for the
different form factors themselves.

supports present similarities is examined. Each sparse signal is acquired using
the same noisy linear measurement process, which returns fewer observations
than the dimension of the sparse signals. The measurement noise is assumed
additive, Gaussian, and admits different variances for each sparse signal that
is measured. Using the theory of compressed sensing, the performance of
simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) is analysed for the envisioned
signal model. The cornerstone of this paper is a novel analysis method upper
bounding the probability that SOMP recovers at least one incorrect entry of the
joint support during a prescribed number of iterations. Furthermore, the
probability of SOMP failing is investigated whenever the number of sparse
signals being recovered simultaneously increases and tends to infinity. In
particular, convincing observations and theoretical results suggest that SOMP
committing no mistake in the noiseless case does not guarantee the absence of
error in the noisy case whenever the number of acquired sparse signals scales
to infinity. Finally, simulation results confirm the validity of the
theoretical results.

challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ
CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using
off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN
pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer
learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset

previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks

beyond the decoupling limit. We then proceed to a systematic construction of
the interactions by using the Levi-Civita tensors. Both approaches lead to a
finite family of allowed derivative self-interactions for the Proca field. This
construction allows us to show that some higher order terms recently introduced
as new interactions trivialize in 4 dimensions by virtue of the Cayley-Hamilton
theorem. Moreover, we discuss how the resulting derivative interactions can be
written in a compact determinantal form, which can also be regarded as a
generalization of the Born-Infeld lagrangian for electromagnetism. Finally, we
generalize our results for a curved background and give the necessary
non-minimal couplings guaranteeing that no additional polarizations propagate

We
present a strong maximum principle for nonlocal time-dependent Dirichlet
problems. Results are for bounded functions of space, rather than
(semi)-continuous functions. Solutions that attain interior global extrema must
be identically trivial. However, depending on the nonlinearity, trivial
solutions may not be constant in space; they may have an infinite number of
discontinuities, for example. We give examples of nonconstant trivial solutions
for different nonlinearities. For porous medium-type equations, these functions
do not solve the associated classical differential equations, even those in
weak form. We also show that these problems are globally wellposed for
Lipschitz, nonnegative diffusion coefficients.

solutions in nonlinear systems. We focus on mechanical and structural systems
where we usually avoid multistability for safety and reliability. We want to be
sure that in the given range of parameters and initial conditions the expected
solution is the only possible or at least has dominant basin of attraction. We
propose an algorithm to estimate the probability of reaching the solution in
given (accessible) ranges of initial conditions and parameters. We use a
modified method of basin stability (Menck et. al., Nature Physics, 9(2) 2013).
In our investigation we examine three different systems: a Duffing oscillator
with a tuned mass absorber, a bilinear impacting oscillator and a beam with
attached rotating pendula. We present the results that prove the usefulness of
the proposed algorithm and highlight its strengths in comparison with classical
analysis of nonlinear systems (analytical solutions, path-following, basin of
attraction ect.). We show that with relatively small computational effort
(comparing to classical analysis) we can predict the behaviour of the system
and select the ranges in parameter's space where the system behaves in a
presumed way. The method can be used in all types of nonlinear complex systems.

activity has proven to be one of the biggest challenges in computational
neuroscience. Even if there is no definitive answer to this issue, the most
common procedure to express this randomness is the use of stochastic models. In
accordance with the origin of variability, the sources of randomness are
classified as intrinsic or extrinsic and give rise to distinct mathematical
frameworks to track down the dynamics of the cell. While the external
variability is generally treated by the use of a Wiener process in models such
as the Integrate-and-Fire model, the internal variability is mostly expressed
via a random firing process. In this paper, we investigate how those distinct
expressions of variability can be related. To do so, we examine the probability
density functions to the corresponding stochastic models and investigate in
what way they can be mapped one to another via integral transforms. Our
theoretical findings offer a new insight view into the particular categories of
variability and it confirms that, despite their contrasting nature, the
mathematical formalization of internal and external variability are strikingly
similar.

cells using self-consistent computational modeling. The significance of band
alignment engineering and optimized carrier mobility are quantitatively
explored as a function of sub bandgap defect densities (N_t) in the bulk CQD.
For $N_t \leq 10^{15} cm^{-3}$, band alignment engineering near the interface
of CQD and the metal contact could significantly improve open circuit voltage
by suppressing the forward bias dark current. This effect could enhance cell
efficiency up to ~37% for thinner $(< 1 \mu m)$ CQD layers. For thicker $(> 1
\mu m)$ CQD layer, the effect of band engineering is diminished as the forward
bias dark current becomes diffusion-limited and less dependent on the
interfacial band offsets. An optimal carrier mobility in CQD lies in the range
~ 10^{-2} cm^2/Vs - 10^0 cm^2/Vs and shows variation as a function of CQD layer
thickness and the interfacial band offset. For $N_t \approx 10^{14} cm^{-3}$,
an optimally designed cell could provide ~20% efficiency under AM1.5G solar
spectrum without employing advanced structural optimizations such as the
nanostructured electrodes. These physical insights contribute to a better
understanding of quantum dot solar cell design, allowing a step further towards
a highly efficient and a low cost solar cell technology.

risk of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases and microangiopathies in

directly correlates cardiac tachyarrhythmia, and atherogenesis in a
concentration and duration dependent manner. Moreover, the other effects of
long-term arsenic exposure include induction of non-insulin dependent diabetes
by mechanisms yet to be understood. On the other hand, there are controversial
issues, gaps in knowledge, and future research priorities of accelerated
incidences of CVD and mortalities in patients with HIV who are under long-term
anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Although, both HIV infection itself and various
components of ART initiate significant pathological alterations in the
myocardium and the vasculature, simultaneous environmental exposure to arsenic
which is more convincingly being recognized as a facilitator of HIV viral
cycling in the infected immune cells, may contribute an additional layer of
adversity in these patients. In this mini-review which have been fortified with
our own preliminary data, we will discuss some of the key current understating
of chronic arsenic exposure, and its possible impact on the accelerated HIV/ART

puzzle that has engaged the minds of the physicists for almost a century. The
insufficiency of today's and foreseeable future's technology for a direct reach
into the Planck energies at which the fundamental theory, the Quantum Theory of
Gravity, lies has lead to the search of the low energy effects of that
fundamental Planck level theory irregardless of the details of it. In this
thesis, one of the leading candidates of such an exotic effect, that is the
violation of Lorentz and CPT symmetries is analyzed. The action level effective
field theoretical framework for such an analysis called Standard Model
Extension has already been in the literature for the last two decades; here,
the nonminimal photon sector of such a framework is examined from a quantum
field theoretical point of view. All possible polarization vectors for
different kinds of CPT violations, the generic forms of the dispersion
relations that these polarization vectors satisfy, and the corresponding
propagators of the photon field are explicitly calculated. Special models of
Lorentz violations are introduced, and a particular one called vacuum
orthogonal model is analyzed extensively. It is found that this particular form
of Lorentz violation cannot induce any effects that is detectable in the vacuum
propagation of the photon. Isotropic and leading order cases of the Lorentz
violation is studied and this found result is explicitly shown.

the attachment times of the immature T-cell receptor TCR:
peptide-major-histocompatibility-complex pMHC immunological synapse bond. The
key question addressed here is the following: how does a synapse bond remain
stabilized in the presence of high frequency thermal noise that potentially
equates to a strong detaching force? Focusing on the average time persistence
of an immature synapse, we show that the high frequency nodes accompanying
large fluctuations are counterbalanced by low frequency nodes that evolve over
longer time periods. Our analysis shows that such a behavior could be easily
explained from the fact that the survival probability distribution is governed
by two distinct phases, for the two different time regimes. The relatively
shorter time scales correspond to the cohesion:adhesion induced immature bond
formation whereas the larger time reciprocates the association:dissociation
regime leading to TCR:pMHC signaling. From an estimation of the bond survival
probability, we show that at shorter time scales, this probability
$P_{\Delta}(\tau)$ scales with time $\tau$ as an universal function of a
rescaled noise amplitude $\frac{D}{\Delta^2}$, such that $P_{\Delta}(\tau)\sim
\tau^{-(\frac{\Delta}{\sqrt{D}}+\frac{1}{2})}$, $\Delta$ being the distance
from the mean inter-membrane (T cell:Antigen Presenting Cell) separation
distance. The crossover from this shorter to a longer time regime leads to an
universality in the dynamics, at which point the survival probability shows a
different power-law scaling compared to the one at shorter time scales. In
biological terms, such a crossover indicates that the TCR:pMHC bond has a
survival probability with a slower decay rate than the longer LFA-1:ICAM-1 bond
justifying its stability.
