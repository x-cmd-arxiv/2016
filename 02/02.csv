classification task. Crowd workers complete simple binary microtasks whose
results are aggregated to give the final result. We consider the novel scenario
where workers have a reject option so they may skip microtasks when they are
unable or choose not to respond. For example, in mismatched speech
transcription, workers who do not know the language may not be able to respond
to microtasks focused on phonological dimensions outside their categorical
perception. We present an aggregation approach using a weighted majority voting
rule, where each worker's response is assigned an optimized weight to maximize
the crowd's classification performance. We evaluate system performance in both
exact and asymptotic forms. Further, we consider the setting where there may be
a set of greedy workers that complete microtasks even when they are unable to
perform it reliably. We consider an oblivious and an expurgation strategy to
deal with greedy workers, developing an algorithm to adaptively switch between
the two based on the estimated fraction of greedy workers in the anonymous
crowd. Simulation results show improved performance compared with conventional
majority voting.

detection using convolutional neural networks. In our approach, we use a
gradient descent method to iteratively modify the input images based on the
pixel-wise gradients to reduce a pre-defined cost function, which is defined to
measure the class-specific objectness and clamp the class-irrelevant outputs to
maintain image background. The pixel-wise gradients can be efficiently computed
using the back-propagation algorithm. We further apply SLIC superpixels and LAB
color based low level saliency features to smooth and refine the gradients. Our
methods are quite computationally efficient, much faster than other deep
learning based saliency methods. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks,
namely Pascal VOC 2012 and MSRA10k, have shown that our proposed methods can
generate high-quality salience maps, at least comparable with many slow and
complicated deep learning methods. Comparing with the pure low-level methods,
our approach excels in handling many difficult images, which contain complex
background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects, and/or very
small salient objects.

leveraging dynamic consensus as a mechanism to distribute the computation among

averaging operations. Asymptotic convergence to (stationary) solutions of the
nonconvex problem is established. Our algorithmic framework is then customized

different summands of a global objective function are available at nodes of a

descent and dual ascent updates on a suitably defined augmented Lagrangian. The
structure of the augmented Lagrangian makes this problem non-decomposable,

addressed by the use of the alternating direction method of multipliers. The

relies on: (i) The use of a separable quadratic approximation of the augmented

first order condition imposed on the minimization of the quadratic
approximation of the augmented Lagrangian. The sequences of primal and dual
variables generated by ESOM are shown to converge linearly to their optimal
arguments when the aggregate cost function is strongly convex and its gradients
are Lipschitz continuous. Numerical results demonstrate advantages of ESOM

theoretical models of the signal. We develop a novel effective-one-body
waveform model that includes, for the first time, dynamic (instead of only
adiabatic) tides of the neutron star, as well as the merger signal for
neutron-star--black-hole binaries. We demonstrate the importance of the dynamic
tides by comparing our model against new numerical-relativity simulations of
nonspinning neutron-star--black-hole binaries spanning more than 24
gravitational-wave cycles, and to other existing numerical simulations for
double neutron-star systems. Furthermore, we derive an effective description
that makes explicit the dependence of matter effects on two key parameters:
tidal deformability and fundamental oscillation frequency.

worldwide. In the developing world NS is often treated without an identified
microbial pathogen. Amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene can be
used to identify organisms that are difficult to detect by routine
microbiological methods. However, contaminating bacteria are ubiquitous in both
hospital settings and research reagents, and must be accounted for to make
effective use of these data. In the present study, we sequenced the bacterial
16S rRNA gene obtained from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 80 neonates
presenting with NS to the Mbarara Regional Hospital in Uganda. Assuming that
patterns of background contamination would be independent of pathogenic
microorganism DNA, we applied a novel quantitative approach using principal
orthogonal decomposition to separate background contamination from potential
pathogens in sequencing data. We designed our quantitative approach contrasting
blood, CSF, and control specimens, and employed a variety of statistical random
matrix bootstrap hypotheses to estimate statistical significance. These
analyses demonstrate that Leptospira appears present in some infants presenting
within 48 hr of birth, indicative of infection in utero, and up to 28 days of
age, suggesting environmental exposure. This organism cannot be cultured in
routine bacteriological settings, and is enzootic in the cattle that the rural
peoples of western Uganda often live in close proximity. Our findings
demonstrate that statistical approaches to remove background organisms common
in 16S sequence data can reveal putative pathogens in small volume biological
samples from newborns. This computational analysis thus reveals an important
medical finding that has the potential to alter therapy and prevention efforts
in a critically ill population.

in the framework of the SG model as the emission from the two magnetic
hemispheres. The OPC radio-lag distribution shows higher agreement with
observations suggesting that assuming polar radio emission, the gamma-ray
emission regions are likely to be located in the outer magnetosphere. The
larger agreement between simulated and LAT estimations in the framework of the
OPC suggests that the OPC model best predicts the observed variety of profile
shapes. The larger agreement between observations and the OPC model jointly

$X$'s. We focus in particular on the symmetries of the theory, and the minimal

there exists an unambiguous mapping between the GUP with a deformed quantum
algebra and a quadratic Hamiltonian into a standard, Heisenberg algebra of
operators and an aquadratic Hamiltonian, provided the boost sector of the
symmetries is modified accordingly. The theory can also be mapped to a
completely standard Quantum Mechanics with standard symmetries, but with
momentum dependent position operators. Next, we investigate the Hilbert space
representations of these algebraically equivalent models, and focus,
specifically on whether they exhibit a minimal length. We carry the functional
analysis of the various operators involved, and show that the appearance of a
minimal length critically depends on the relationship between the generators of
translations and the physical momenta. In particular, because this relationship
is preserved by the algebraic mapping presented in this paper, when a minimal
length is present in the standard GUP, it is also present in the corresponding
Aquadratic Hamiltonian formulation, despite the perfectly standard algebra of
this model. In general, a minimal length requires bounded generators of
translations, i.e. a specific kind of quantization of space, and this depends
on the precise shape of the function $f$ defined previously. This result
provides an elegant and unambiguous classification of which universal quantum
gravity corrections lead to the emergence of a minimal length.

fundamental cosmological parameters. A number of recent studies using this
probe have claimed tension with the cosmology preferred by the analysis of the
Planck primary CMB data, in the sense that there are fewer clusters observed
than predicted based on the primary CMB cosmology. One possible resolution to
this problem is systematic errors in the absolute halo mass calibration in
cluster studies, which is required to convert the standard theoretical
prediction (the halo mass function) into counts as a function of the observable
(e.g., X-ray luminosity, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux, optical richness). Here we
propose an alternative strategy, which is to directly compare predicted and
observed cluster counts as a function of the one-dimensional velocity
dispersion of the cluster galaxies. We argue that the velocity dispersion of
groups/clusters can be theoretically predicted as robustly as mass but, unlike
mass, it can also be directly observed, thus circumventing the main systematic
bias in traditional cluster counts studies. With the aid of the BAHAMAS suite
of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we demonstrate the potential of the
velocity dispersion counts for discriminating even similar $\Lambda$CDM models.
These predictions can be compared with the results from existing redshift
surveys such as the highly-complete Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, and
upcoming wide-field spectroscopic surveys such as the Wide Area Vista
Extragalactic Survey (WAVES) and the Dark Energy Survey Instrument (DESI).

can be don't care or wild card characters in the pattern. Specifically, given a
pattern $P$ of length $m$ and a text $T$ of length $n$, we want to find all
occurrences of $P$ in $T$ that have no more than $k$ mismatches. The pattern
can have don't care characters, which match any character. Without don't cares,
the best known algorithm for pattern matching with $k$ mismatches has a runtime
of $O(n\sqrt{k \log k})$. With don't cares in the pattern, the best
deterministic algorithm has a runtime of $O(nk polylog m)$. Therefore, there is
an important gap between the versions with and without don't cares.
  In this paper we give an algorithm whose runtime increases with the number of
don't cares. We define an {\em island} to be a maximal length substring of $P$
that does not contain don't cares. Let $q$ be the number of islands in $P$. We
present an algorithm that runs in $O(n\sqrt{k\log m}+n\min\{\sqrt[3]{qk\log^2

becomes $O(n\sqrt{k\log m})$, which essentially matches the best known runtime
for pattern matching with $k$ mismatches without don't cares. If the number of
islands $q$ is $O(k^2)$, this algorithm is asymptotically faster than the
previous best algorithm for pattern matching with $k$ mismatches with don't
cares in the pattern.

which revealed us that the asteroid is differentiated and possesses a
relatively thin basaltic crust that survived to the evolution of the asteroid
belt and the Solar System. However, little is know about the effects of past
events like the Late Heavy Bombardment on this crust. We address this gap in
our knowledge by simulating the LHB in the different dynamical scenarios
proposed for the migration of the giant planets in the broad framework of the
Nice Model. The results of simulations generate information about produced
crater population, surface saturation, mass loss and mass gain of Vesta and
number of energetic or catastrophic impacts during LHB. Our results reveal that
planet-planet scattering is a dynamically favourable migration mechanism for
the survival of Vesta and its crust. The number of impacts on Vesta estimated
as due to the LHB is $31\pm5$, i.e. about 5 times larger than the number of
impacts that would have occurred in an unperturbed main belt in the same time
interval. The contribution of a possible extended belt, instead, is quite
limited and can be quantified in $2\pm1$ impacts. The chance of energetic and
catastrophic impacts is less than 10\% and is compatible with the absence of
giant craters dated back to 4 Ga ago and with the survival of the asteroid
during the LHB. The mass loss translates in the erosion of $3-5$ meters of the
crust, consistently with the global survival of the basaltic crust of Vesta
confirmed by the Dawn mission. Our analysis revealed that the contribution of
the LHB to the cratering of Vesta' surface is not significant and is actually
erased by the crater population produced by the following 4 Ga of collisional
evolution of the asteroid, in agreement with the data provided by the Dawn
mission.

transversal to propagation embedded in a Gaussian beam. We use the scattering
modes, which are solutions of the paraxial wave equation that can be combined
straightforwardly to express the initial condition and therefore permit to
solve the problem. To construct the scattering modes one needs to obtain a
particular set of polynomials, which play an analogous role than Laguerre
polynomials for Laguerre-Gaussian modes. We demonstrate here the recurrence
relations needed to determine these polynomials. To stress the utility and
strength of the method we solve first the problem of an initial Gaussian beam

the solution permits one to obtain analytical expressions. These can used to
obtain closed expressions for meaningful quantities, like the distance at which
the positive and negative singularities merge, closing the loop of a vortex
line. Furthermore, we present an example of calculation of an specific
discrete-Gauss state, which is the solution of the diffraction of a
Laguerre-Gauss state showing definite angular momentum (that is, a highly

life ways, and is therefore an issue of central importance in hunter-gatherer
studies. Hunter-gatherers vary widely in annual rates of residential mobility,
and understanding the sources of this variation has long been of interest to
anthropologists and archaeologists. Since mobility is, to a large extent,
driven by the need for a continuous supply of food, a natural framework for
addressing this question is provided by the metabolic theory of ecology. This
provides a powerful framework for formulating formal testable hypotheses
concerning evolutionary and ecological constraints on the scale and variation
of hunter-gatherer residential mobility. We evaluate these predictions using
extant data and show strong support for the hypotheses. We show that the
overall scale of hunter-gatherer residential mobility is predicted by average
human body size, and the limited capacity of mobile hunter-gatherers to store
energy internally. We then show that the majority of variation in residential
mobility observed across cultures is predicted by energy availability in local
ecosystems. Our results demonstrate that large-scale evolutionary and
ecological processes, common to all plants and animals, constrain
hunter-gatherers in predictable ways as they move through territories to
effectively exploit resources over the course of a year. Moreover, our results
extend the scope of the metabolic theory of ecology by showing how it
successfully predicts variation in the behavioral ecology of populations within
a species.

seen increased use in astrophysical computations. Even so, RMHD codes remain
fragile. The reconstruction can sometimes yield superluminal velocities in
certain parts of the mesh. In this paper we present a reconstruction strategy
that overcomes this problem by making a single conservative to primitive
transformation per cell followed by higher order WENO reconstruction on a
carefully chosen set of primitives that guarantee subluminal reconstruction of
the flow variables. For temporal evolution via a predictor step we also present
second, third and fourth order accurate ADER methods that keep the velocity
subluminal during the predictor step. The RMHD system also requires the
magnetic field to be evolved in a divergence-free fashion. In the treatment of
classical numerical MHD the analogous issue has seen much recent progress with
the advent of multidimensional Riemann solvers. By developing multidimensional
Riemann solvers for RMHD, we show that similar advances extend to RMHD. As a
result, the face-centered magnetic fields can be evolved much more accurately
using the edge-centered electric fields in the corrector step. Those
edge-centered electric fields come from a multidimensional Riemann solver for
RMHD which we present in this paper. In this paper we also develop several new
test problems for RMHD. We show that RMHD vortices can be designed that
propagate on the computational mesh as self-preserving structures. These RMHD
vortex test problems provide a means to do truly multidimensional accuracy
testing for RMHD codes. Several other stringent test problems are presented. We

Approximation Nonlinear Force-Free Field (VCA-NLFFF) code, which is designed to
measure the evolution of the potential, nonpotential, free energies, and the
dissipated magnetic energies during solar flares. This code provides a
complementary and alternative method to existing traditional NLFFF codes. The
chief advantages of the VCA-NLFFF code over traditional NLFFF codes are the
circumvention of the unrealistic assumption of a force-free photosphere in the
magnetic field extrapolation method, the capability to minimize the
misalignment angles between observed coronal loops (or chromospheric fibril
structures) and theoretical model field lines, as well as computational speed.
In performance tests of the VCA-NLFFF code, by comparing with the NLFFF code of
Wiegelmann (2004), we find agreement in the potential, nonpotential, and free
energy within a factor of about 1.3, but the Wiegelmann code yields in the
average a factor of 2 lower flare energies. The VCA-NLFFF code is found to
detect decreases in flare energies in most X, M, and C-class flares. The
successful detection of energy decreases during a variety of flares with the
VCA-NLFFF code indicates that current-driven twisting and untwisting of the
magnetic field is an adequate model to quantify the storage of magnetic
energies in active regions and their dissipation during flares. - The VCA-NLFFF
code is also publicly available in the Solar SoftWare (SSW).

the K2 Cycle 5 field. Our follow-up campaign involves precise radial velocity

$1.773\pm0.086M_J$, confirming its status as a planet. We also detect the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for K2-34b and show that the system has a good
spin-orbit alignment ($\lambda=-1_{-9}^{+10}$ degrees). High-contrast images
obtained by the HiCIAO camera on the Subaru 8.2-m telescope reveal a faint
companion candidate ($\Delta m_H=6.19\pm 0.11$ mag) at a separation of

  Stations",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The co-existence of small cell base stations (SBSs) with conventional
macrocell base station is a promising approach to boost the capacity and
coverage of cellular networks. However, densifying the network with a viral
deployment of SBSs can significantly increase energy consumption. To reduce the
reliance on unsustainable energy sources, one can adopt self-powered SBSs that
rely solely on energy harvesting. Due to the uncertainty of energy arrival and
the finite capacity of energy storage systems, self-powered SBSs must smartly
optimize their ON and OFF schedule. In this paper, the problem of ON/OFF
scheduling of self-powered SBSs is studied, in the presence of energy
harvesting uncertainty with the goal of minimizing the operational costs
consisted of energy consumption and transmission delay of a network. For the
original problem, we show an algorithm can solve the problem in the
illustrative case. To reduce the complexity of the original problem, an
approximation is proposed. To solve the approximated problem, a novel approach
based on the ski rental framework, a powerful online optimization tool, is
proposed. Using this approach, each SBS can effectively decide on its ON/OFF
schedule autonomously, without any prior information on future energy arrivals.
By using competitive analysis, a deterministic online algorithm (DOA) and a
randomized online algorithm (ROA) are developed. ROA is shown to achieve the
optimal competitive ratio in the approximation problem. Simulation results show
that, compared to a baseline approach, the ROA can yield performance gains
reaching up to 15.6% in terms of reduced total energy consumption of SBSs and
up to 20.6% in terms of per-SBS network delay reduction. The results shed light
on the fundamental aspects that impact the ON time of SBSs while demonstrating
that the proposed ROA can reduce up to 69.9% the total cost compared to a
baseline approach.

theory of ""big cells"" adapted to partial affine flag varieties, and combines
Deligne's theory of weights with a suitable contracting $\mathbb G_m$-action on
those big cells. Both proofs rely on our general result that the intersection

to having a limited number of RF-chains, hybrid beamformers are designed where
phase-only processing is done at the RF-band, followed by digital processing at
the baseband. The proposed receiver is a row combiner that clusters
sufficiently correlated antenna elements, and its' performance is compared
against random projection via a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrix. The
analogue to the row combiner is a column spreader, which is dependent on the
transmit correlation, and repeats the transmitted signal over antenna elements
that are correlated. A key benefit of this approach is to reduce the number of
phase shifters used, while outperforming the DFT scheme. When only the
transmitter has correlation and is RF-chain limited, the baseband precoding
vectors are shown to be the eigenvectors of the effective transmit correlation
matrix. Depending on the channel correlation, this matrix can be approximated
to have a tridiagonal Toeplitz structure with the proposed column spreader
(CS). The resulting eigenvalues have a closed form solution which allows us to
characterize the sum rate of the system. Most interestingly, the associated
eigenvectors do not require knowledge of the effective transmit correlation
matrix to be calculated using an Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD) method.

which encompasses Hermite-Pad\'e approximation and constrained multivariate
interpolation, and has applications in coding theory and security.
  This problem asks to find univariate polynomial relations between $m$ vectors
of size $\sigma$; these relations should have small degree with respect to an
input degree shift. For an arbitrary shift, we propose an algorithm for the
computation of an interpolation basis in shifted Popov normal form with a cost
of $\mathcal{O}\tilde{~}(m^{\omega-1} \sigma)$ field operations, where $\omega$
is the exponent of matrix multiplication and the notation
$\mathcal{O}\tilde{~}(\cdot)$ indicates that logarithmic terms are omitted.
  Earlier works, in the case of Hermite-Pad\'e approximation and in the general
interpolation case, compute non-normalized bases. Since for arbitrary shifts
such bases may have size $\Theta(m^2 \sigma)$, the cost bound
$\mathcal{O}\tilde{~}(m^{\omega-1} \sigma)$ was feasible only with restrictive
assumptions on the shift that ensure small output sizes. The question of
handling arbitrary shifts with the same complexity bound was left open.
  To obtain the target cost for any shift, we strengthen the properties of the
output bases, and of those obtained during the course of the algorithm: all the
bases are computed in shifted Popov form, whose size is always $\mathcal{O}(m
\sigma)$. Then, we design a divide-and-conquer scheme. We recursively reduce
the initial interpolation problem to sub-problems with more convenient shifts
by first computing information on the degrees of the intermediate bases.

Twelve sources are detected in the 7-mm continuum. The derived CO luminosities
imply gas masses in the range (0.5-11)x10^{10} M_sun and gas depletion
timescales <200 Myr, using a CO to gas mass conversion factor alpha_CO=0.8
M_sun (K km/s pc^2)^{-1}. Combining the CO luminosities and dust masses, along
with a fixed gas-to-dust ratio, we derive alpha_CO factors in the range
0.4-1.8, similar to what is found in other starbursting systems. We find small
scatter in alpha_CO values within the sample, even though inherent variations
in the spatial distribution of dust and gas in individual cases could bias the
dust-based alpha_CO estimates. We find that lensing magnification factors based
on the CO linewidth to luminosity relation (mu_CO) are highly unreliable, but
particularly when mu<5. Finally, comparison of the gas and dynamical masses
suggest that the average molecular gas fraction stays relatively constant at

principle is based on super synchronous operation of an electron beam
interacting with four degenerate electromagnetic modes in a slow-wave structure
(SWS). The four mode super synchronous regime is associated with a very special
degeneracy condition in the dispersion diagram of a cold periodic SWS called
degenerate band edge (DBE). This regime features a giant group delay in the
finitelength SWS and low starting-oscillation beam current. The starting beam
current is at least an order of magnitude smaller compared to a conventional
backward wave oscillator (BWO) of the same length. As a representative example
we consider a SWS conceived by a periodically-loaded metallic waveguide
supporting a DBE, and investigate starting-oscillation conditions using Pierce
theory generalized to coupled transmission lines (CTL). The proposed super
synchronism regime can be straightforwardly adapted to waveguide geometries
others than the periodically-loaded waveguide considered here since DBE is a
general property that can be realized in a variety of structures.

feature of a coherent state, has remained poor. Intensity noise at many times

optical cavity with high mode selectivity to enforce single-mode lasing,
suppress condensate depletion, and establish gain saturation. The absence of
spurious intensity fluctuations moreover enabled measurement of a transition
from exponential to Gaussian decay of the phase coherence of the polariton

removal of underutilized links and redistribution of loads can lead to the

carry a sufficiently large load or are essential for global connectivity. This
incentivized redistribution process is controlled by a single parameter which

applications, such as the detection of conserved biological network motifs, the
prediction of protein interactions, and the reconstruction of phylogenetic
trees [1, 2, 3]. IsoRank is one of the first global network alignment
algorithms [4, 5, 6], where the goal is to match all (or most) of the nodes of
two PPI networks. The IsoRank algorithm first computes a pairwise node
similarity metric, and then generates a matching between the two node sets
based on this metric. The metric is a convex combination of a structural
similarity score (with weight $ \alpha $) and an extraneous amino-acid sequence
similarity score for two proteins (with weight $ 1 - \alpha $). In this short
paper, we make two contributions. First, we show that when IsoRank similarity
depends only on network structure ($\alpha = 1$), the similarity of two nodes
is only a function of their degrees. In other words, IsoRank similarity is
invariant to any network rewiring that does not affect the node degrees. This
result suggests a reason for the poor performance of IsoRank in structure-only
($ \alpha = 1 $) alignment. Second, using ideas from [7, 8], we develop an
approximation algorithm that outperforms IsoRank (including recent versions
with better scaling, e.g., [9]) by several orders of magnitude in time and
memory complexity, despite only a negligible loss in precision.

that diffuse into an adjacent FM material. There have been intensive efforts to
search for candidate materials that exhibit large spin Hall angles, i.e.
efficient charge to spin current conversion. Here we report, using spin torque
ferromagnetic resonance, the observation of a giant spin Hall angle of up to
~0.35 in (100) oriented single crystalline antiferromagnetic (AF) IrMn3 thin
films, coupled to ferromagnetic permalloy layers, and a spin Hall angle that is
about three times smaller in (111) oriented films. For the (100) oriented

changed by manipulating the populations of the various AF domains through field
annealing. Using ab-initio calculations we show that the triangular AF
structure of IrMn3 gives rise to a substantial intrinsic spin Hall conductivity
that is three times larger for the (100) than for the (111) orientations,

setting the thermal profile and composition of the white dwarf. Using the
\texttt{MESA} stellar evolution code, we follow this convective burning and
examine the production of neutron-rich isotopes. The neutron content of the SN
fuel has important consequences for the ensuing nucleosynthesis, and, in
particular, for the production of secondary Fe-peak nuclei like Mn and stable
Ni. These elements have been observed in the X-ray spectra of SN remnants like
Tycho, Kepler, and 3C 397, and their yields can provide valuable insights into
the physics of SNe Ia and the properties of their progenitors. We find that
weak reactions during simmering can at most generate a neutron excess of

has the following application development features: (i) abstractions that
enable the expression of ensembles as primary entities, and (ii) support for
ensemble-based execution patterns that capture the majority of application

decouples workload execution and resource management details from the
expression of the application, and enables the efficient and dynamic execution
of ensembles on heterogeneous computing resources. We investigate three
execution patterns and characterize the scalability and overhead of Ensemble
toolkit for these patterns. We investigate scaling properties for up to O(1000)
concurrent ensembles and O(1000) cores and find linear weak and strong scaling

a similar distribution of cluster and field galaxies in the MZR and mass vs.

higher O/Hs compared to their disk-dominated counterparts. We use the location
of galaxies in the projected velocity vs. position phase-space to separate our
cluster sample into a region of objects accreted longer time ago and a region
of recently accreted and infalling galaxies. We find a higher fraction of
accreted metal-rich galaxies (63%) compared to the fraction of 28% of
metal-rich galaxies in the infalling regions. Intermediate mass galaxies
falling into the cluster for the first time are found to be in agreement with
predictions of the fundamental metallicity relation. In contrast, for already
accreted star-forming galaxies of similar masses, we find on average
metallicities higher than predicted by the models. This trend is intensified
for accreted cluster galaxies of the lowest mass bin, that display
metallicities 2-3 times higher than predicted by models with primordial gas
inflow. Environmental effects therefore strongly influence gas regulations and
control gas metallicities of log(M/Msun)<10.2 (Salpeter IMF) cluster galaxies.
We also investigate chemical evolutionary paths of model galaxies with and
without inflow of gas showing that strangulation is needed to explain the
higher metallicities of accreted cluster galaxies. Our results favor a

the population of terrestrial planets around both solar-mass (FGK type) and

requires accurate knowledge of the spectral errors and covariances.
Unfortunately, the complex image processing used in high-contrast
integral-field spectrograph (IFS) observations generally produces spectral
covariances that are poorly understood and often ignored. In this work, we show
how to measure the spectral errors and covariances and include them
self-consistently in parameter retrievals. By combining model exoplanet spectra
with a realistic noise model generated from GPI early science data, we show
that ignoring spectral covariance in high-contrast IFS data can both bias
inferred parameters and lead to unreliable confidence regions on those
parameters. This problem is made worse by the common practice of scaling the
$\chi^2$ per degree of freedom to unity; the input parameters then fall outside
the $95\%$ confidence regions in as many as ${\sim}80\%$ of noise realizations.
The biases we observe can approach the typical levels of precision achieved in
high-contrast spectroscopy. Accounting for realistic priors in fully Bayesian
retrievals can also have a significant impact on the inferred parameters.
Plausible priors on effective temperature and surface gravity can vary by an
order of magnitude across the confidence regions appropriate for objects with
weak age constraints; priors for objects with good age constraints are
dominated by modeling uncertainties. Our methods are directly applicable to
existing high-contrast IFSs including GPI and SPHERE, as well as upcoming
instruments like CHARIS and, ultimately, WFIRST-AFTA.

$l_B=(\hbar c/eB)^{1/2}$, then the spatial coordinates $X,Y$ of the electron
cease to commute, $[X,Y]=il_B^2$. As a consequence, localization of the
electron becomes limited by Heisenberg uncertainty, and the linear
bath-electron coupling becomes unconventional. Moreover, because the kinetic
energy of the electron is quenched by the strong magnetic field, the electron
has no energy to give to or take from the bath, and so the usual connection
between frictional forces and dissipation no longer holds. These two features
make quantum Brownian motion topological, in the regime $l_F\gg l_B$, which is
at the verge of current experimental capabilities. We model topological quantum
Brownian motion in terms of an unconventional operator Langevin equation
derived from first principles, and solve this equation with the aim of
characterizing diffusion. While diffusion in the noncommutative plane turns out
to be conventional, with the mean displacement squared being proportional to
$t^\alpha$ and $\alpha=1$, there is an exotic regime for the proportionality
constant in which it is directly proportional to the friction coefficient and
inversely proportional to the square of the magnetic field: in this regime,
friction helps diffusion and the magnetic field suppresses all fluctuations. We
also show that quantum tunneling can be completely suppressed in the

conversion triggered by collective run-away modes of the interacting flavor
oscillators. The growth rates were usually found to be of order a typical
vacuum oscillation frequency $\Delta m^2/2E$. However, even in the simple case
of a $\nu_e$ beam interacting with an opposite-moving $\bar\nu_e$ beam, and
allowing for spatial inhomogeneities, the growth rate of the fastest-growing
Fourier mode is of order $\mu=\sqrt{2} G_{\rm F} n_{\nu}$, a typical
$\nu$--$\nu$ interaction energy. This growth rate is much larger than the
vacuum oscillation frequency and gives rise to flavor conversion on a much
shorter time scale. This phenomenon of ""fast flavor conversion"" occurs even for
vanishing $\Delta m^2/2E$ and thus does not depend on energy, but only on the
angle distributions. Moreover, it does not require neutrinos to mix or to have
masses, except perhaps for providing seed disturbances. We also construct a
simple homogeneous example consisting of intersecting beams and study a
schematic supernova model proposed by Ray Sawyer, where $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$

Lagrangian for the scalar fields with a non-canonical kinetic term. We study
the effective action of the scalar position moduli of Type II D$p$-branes. In
many instances the kinetic terms are in fact modified by a term proportional to
the scalar potential itself. This can be linked to the appearance of
higher-dimensional supersymmetric operators correcting the K\""ahler potential.
We identify the supersymmetric dimension-eight operators describing the
$\alpha'$ corrections captured by the D-brane Dirac-Born-Infeld action. Our
analysis then allows an embedding of the D-brane moduli effective action into
an $\mathcal N = 1$ supergravity formulation. The effects of the
potential-dependent kinetic terms may be very important if one of the scalars
is the inflaton, since they lead to a flattening of the scalar potential. We
analyze this flattening effect in detail and compute its impact on the CMB
observables for single-field inflation with monomial potentials.

that the varying absorber is located beyond the emission-weighted average

function of many weakly dependent random variables that is not too sensitive to

expectation. This phenomenon is most completely understood when the arguments
are mutually independent random variables, and there exist several powerful
complementary methods for proving concentration inequalities, such as the

inequalities. The setting of dependent arguments is much less well understood.
This chapter focuses on the martingale method for deriving concentration
inequalities without independence assumptions. In particular, we use the
machinery of so-called Wasserstein matrices to show that the Azuma-Hoeffding
concentration inequality for martingales with almost surely bounded
differences, when applied in a sufficiently abstract setting, is powerful
enough to recover and sharpen several known concentration results for
nonproduct measures. Wasserstein matrices provide a natural formalism for
capturing the interplay between the metric and the probabilistic structures,
which is fundamental to the concentration phenomenon.

  Consistent Hashing Mechanism","13 pages",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Die-stacked DRAM has been proposed for use as a large, high-bandwidth,
last-level cache with hundreds or thousands of megabytes of capacity. Not all
workloads (or phases) can productively utilize this much cache space, however.
Unfortunately, the unused (or under-used) cache continues to consume power due
to leakage in the peripheral circuitry and periodic DRAM refresh. Dynamically
adjusting the available DRAM cache capacity could largely eliminate this energy
overhead. However, the current proposed DRAM cache organization introduces new
challenges for dynamic cache resizing. The organization differs from a
conventional SRAM cache organization because it places entire cache sets and
their tags within a single bank to reduce on-chip area and power overhead.
Hence, resizing a DRAM cache requires remapping sets from the powered-down
banks to active banks.
  In this paper, we propose CRUNCH (Cache Resizing Using Native Consistent
Hashing), a hardware data remapping scheme inspired by consistent hashing, an
algorithm originally proposed to uniformly and dynamically distribute Internet
traffic across a changing population of web servers. CRUNCH provides a
load-balanced remapping of data from the powered-down banks alone to the active
banks, without requiring sets from all banks to be remapped, unlike naive
schemes to achieve load balancing. CRUNCH remaps only sets from the
powered-down banks, so it achieves this load balancing with low bank
power-up/down transition latencies. CRUNCH's combination of good load balancing
and low transition latencies provides a substrate to enable efficient DRAM
cache resizing.

probability of death and by a decrease in the reproductive capacity. Individual
age-dependent rates of survival and reproduction have a strong impact on
population dynamics, and the genetic elements determining survival and
reproduction are under different selective forces throughout an organism
lifespan. Here we develop a highly versatile numerical model of genome
evolution --- both asexual and sexual --- for a population of virtual
individuals with overlapping generations, where the genetic elements affecting
survival and reproduction rate at different life stages are free to evolve due
to mutation and selection. Our model recapitulates several emerging properties
of natural populations, developing longer reproductive lifespan under stable
conditions and shorter survival and reproduction in unstable environments.
Faster aging results as the consequence of the reduced strength of purifying
selection in more unstable populations, which have large portions of the genome
that accumulate detrimental mutations. Unlike sexually reproducing populations
under constant resources, asexually reproducing populations fail to develop an
age-dependent increase in death rates and decrease in reproduction rates,
therefore escaping senescence. Our model provides a powerful in silico
framework to simulate how populations and genomes change in the context of
biological aging and opens a novel analytical opportunity to characterize how
real populations evolve their specific aging dynamics.

  ""Characterizing Application Memory Error Vulnerability to Optimize Datacenter

vulnerability to optimize datacenter cost via Heterogeneous-Reliability Memory
(HRM), which was published in DSN 2014, and examines the work's significance
and future potential. Memory devices represent a key component of datacenter
total cost of ownership (TCO), and techniques used to reduce errors that occur
on these devices increase this cost. Existing approaches to providing
reliability for memory devices pessimistically treat all data as equally
vulnerable to memory errors. Our key insight is that there exists a diverse
spectrum of tolerance to memory errors in new data-intensive applications, and
that traditional one-size-fits-all memory reliability techniques are
inefficient in terms of cost. This presents an opportunity to greatly reduce
server hardware cost by provisioning the right amount of memory reliability for
different applications.
  Toward this end, in our DSN 2014 paper, we make three main contributions to
enable highly-reliable servers at low datacenter cost. First, we develop a new
methodology to quantify the tolerance of applications to memory errors. Second,
using our methodology, we perform a case study of three new data-intensive
workloads (an interactive web search application, an in-memory key--value
store, and a graph mining framework) to identify new insights into the nature
of application memory error vulnerability. Third, based on our insights, we
propose several new hardware/software heterogeneous-reliability memory system
designs to lower datacenter cost while achieving high reliability and discuss
their trade-offs. We show that our new techniques can reduce server hardware
cost by 4.7% while achieving 99.90% single server availability.

order flow data sets of Chinese stocks, we quantify and compare the LOB

intensity surrounding effective market orders with different aggressiveness. We
find that traders are more likely to submit effective market orders when the
spreads are relatively low, the same-side depth is high, and the opposite-side
depth is low. Such phenomenon is especially significant when the initial spread
is 1 tick. Although the resiliency patterns show obvious diversity after
different types of market orders, the spread and depth can return to the sample
average within 20 best limit updates. The price resiliency behavior is dominant
after aggressive market orders, while the price continuation behavior is
dominant after less-aggressive market orders. Moreover, the effective market
orders produce asymmetrical stimulus to limit orders when the initial spreads
equal to 1 tick. Under this case, effective buy market orders attract more buy
limit orders and effective sell market orders attract more sell limit orders.
The resiliency behavior of spread and depth is linked to limit order intensity.

extent, the effect of beam smearing which artificially inflates the measured
dispersion as it combines regions with different line-of-sight velocities into
a single spatial pixel. We compare the parametric maps of the velocity
dispersion with the Halpha flux (a proxy for local star-formation rate), and
the velocity gradient (a proxy for the local effect of beam smearing). We find,
even for these very nearby galaxies, the Halpha velocity dispersion correlates
more strongly with velocity gradient than with Halpha flux - implying that beam
smearing is still having a significant effect on the velocity dispersion
measurements. We obtain a first-order non parametric correction for the
unweighted and flux weighted mean velocity dispersion by fitting a 2D linear
regression model to the spaxel-by-spaxel data where the velocity gradient and
the Halpha flux are the independent variables and the velocity dispersion is
the dependent variable; and then extrapolating to zero velocity gradient. The
corrected velocity dispersions are a factor of ~1.3-4.5 and ~1.3-2.7 lower than
the uncorrected flux-weighted and unweighted mean line-of-sight velocity
dispersion values, respectively. These corrections are larger than has been
previously cited using disc models of the velocity and velocity dispersion

significant dips in flux. Periodograms of the data reveal a significant
periodicity of 4.5004 hours that is consistent with the dominant (""A"") period
detected with K2. The folded light curve at this period shows there is an
hour-long depression in flux with a mean depth of nearly 10%. This depression
is comprised of a series of shorter and sometimes deeper dips that do not
always occur at exactly the same orbital phase, and which would be unresolvable
with K2. In fact, we find numerous dips in flux at other orbital phases. Nearly
all of the dips associated with this activity appear to drift systematically in
phase with respect to the ""A"" period by about 2.5 minutes per day with a
dispersion of ~0.5 min/d, corresponding to a mean drift period of 4.4928 hours.
In all, we can track approximately 15 of these drifting features. There is no
detection of the ""B""-""F"" periods found with K2, but if they remain at the K2
levels we would not expect to have seen them. We explain the drifting motion as
that of smaller bodies (`fragments') that break off from the asteroid and go
into a slightly smaller orbit than that of the asteroid. If our interpretation
is correct, we can use the drift rate to determine the mass of the asteroid.
Under that scenario, we find that the mass of the asteroid is M_a ~ = 10^23
grams, or about 1/10th the mass of Ceres, with an uncertainty of about a factor
of 2.

for any $L>0$ with control functions $h_0, g_0\in H^{-\frac{1}{3}}(0,T)$ and
$h_1, g_1\in L^2(0,T)$. If we change the position of the controls and consider
$h_0(t)=h_2(t)=0$ (resp. $g_0(t)=g_2(t)=0)$ we obtain the result with control
functions $g_0, g_2\in H^{-\frac{1}{3}}(0,T)$ and $h_1, g_1\in L^2(0,T)$ if and
only if the length $L$ of the spatial domain $(0,L)$ belongs to a countable
set. In all cases the regularity of the controls are sharp in time. If only one
control act in the boundary condition, $h_0(t)=g_0(t)=h_2(t)=g_2(t)=0$ and
$g_1(t)=0$ (resp. $h_1(t)=0$), the linearized system is proved to be exactly
controllable for small values of the length $L$ and large time of control $T$.
Finally, the nonlinear system is shown to be locally exactly controllable via
the contraction mapping principle, if the associated linearized systems are
exactly controllable.

two stiff terms: the transport term and the collision operator. The stiffness
in the former comes from the fact that particles (such as photons) travels at
the speed of light, while that in the latter is due to the strong scattering in
the diffusive regime. We study the fully implicit scheme for this equation to
account for the stiffness. The main challenge in the implicit treatment is the
coupling between the spacial and velocity coordinates that requires the large
size of the to-be-inverted matrix, which is also ill-conditioned and not
necessarily symmetric. Our main idea is to utilize the spectral structure of
the ill-conditioned matrix to construct a pre-conditioner, which, along with an
exquisite split of the spatial and angular dependence, significantly improve
the condition number and allows matrix-free treatment. We also design a fast
solver to compute this pre-conditioner explicitly in advance. Meanwhile, we
reformulate the system via an even-odd parity, which results in a symmetric and
positive definite matrix that can be inverted using conjugate gradient method.
This idea can also be implemented to the original non-symmetric system whose
inversion is solved by GMRES. A qualitative comparison with the conventional
methods, including Krylov iterative method pre-conditioned with diffusive
synthetic acceleration and asymptotic preserving scheme via even-odd

based on the geometry of the pristine and modified P network, and supported by
the Wannier functions formalism is introduced to describe a hybridization model
of the P atomic orbitals. {\it Ab initio} calculations show that
non-isoelectronic foreign atoms form quasi-bound states at varying energy
levels and create different polarization states depending on the number of
valence electrons between P and the doping atom. The quantum transport
properties of modified phosphorene ribbons are further described with great
accuracy. The distortions on the electronic bands induced by the external
species lead to strong backscattering effects on the propagating charge
carriers. Depending on the energy of the charge-carrier and the type of doping,
the conduction may range from the diffusive to the localized regime.
Interstitial defects at vacant sites lead to homogeneous transport fingerprints
across different types of doping atoms. We suggest that the relatively low
values of charge mobility reported in experimental measurements may have their
origin in the presence of defects.

constraints on their atmospheric compositions. However, molecular abundances
derived from spectra are degenerate with the absorption cross sections which
form critical input data in atmospheric models. Therefore, it is important to
quantify the uncertainties in molecular cross sections to reliably estimate the
uncertainties in derived molecular abundances. However, converting line lists
into cross sections via line broadening involves a series of prescriptions for
which the uncertainties are not well understood. We investigate and quantify
the effects of various factors involved in line broadening in exoplanetary
atmospheres - the profile evaluation width, pressure versus thermal broadening,
broadening agent, spectral resolution, and completeness of broadening
parameters - on molecular absorption cross sections. We use H$_2$O as a case
study as it has the most complete absorption line data. For low resolution
spectra (R$\lesssim$100) for representative temperatures and pressures (T
$\sim$ 500K-3000K, P$\lesssim$1 atm) of H$_2$-rich exoplanetary atmospheres we
find the median difference in cross sections ($\delta$) introduced by various
aspects of pressure broadening to be $\lesssim$1\%. For medium resolutions
(R$\lesssim$5000), including those attainable with JWST, we find that $\delta$
can be up to 40\%. For high resolutions (R$\sim$10$^5$) $\delta$ can be
$\gtrsim$100\%, reaching $\gtrsim$1000\% for low temperatures (T$\lesssim$500K)
and high pressures (P$\gtrsim$1 atm). The effect is higher still for self
broadening. We generate a homogeneous database of absorption cross sections of
molecules of relevance to exoplanetary atmospheres for which high temperature
line lists are available, particularly H$_2$O, CO, CH$_4$, CO$_2$, HCN, and

observations of the simulations (i.e. photometry, color-magnitude diagrams,
surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles). By connecting internal
processes to observable features we highlight the formation of a long-lived
'dark' nuclear subsystem made of black holes (BHs), which results in a
two-component structure. The inner core is dominated by the BH subsystem and
experiences a core collapse phase within the first Gyr. It can be detected in
the stellar (luminous) line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. The outer
extended core - commonly observed in the (luminous) surface brightness profiles
- shows no collapse features and is continuously expanding. We demonstrate how
a King (1966) model fit to observed clusters might help identify the presence
of post core-collapse BH subsystems. For global observables like core and
half-mass radii the direct simulations agree well with Monte-Carlo models.
Variations in the initial mass function can result in significantly different
GC properties (e.g. density distributions) driven by varying amounts of early
mass loss and the number of forming BHs.

channel-coding rate (and thus the optimal erasure-coding rate) that minimizes
the probability of failure for various approximations of the problem.
  Furthermore, an interpretation of the results from an incremental redundancy
point of view shows how rate-compatibility affects the possible trajectories of
the failure probability as a function of the overall code rate. Our numerical
results suggest that an optimal, rateless, hybrid coding scheme for a
single-user wireless system over the PD block-fading channel should have the
rate of the erasure code approach one.

where $A_j$ are self-adjoint linear operators on a separable Hilbert space,
$X_j$ matrices and $I$ is an identity matrix. If $A_j$ are matrices, then
$L(X)\succeq 0$ is called a linear matrix inequality (LMI) and $D_L$ a free
spectrahedron. For monic LMIs, i.e., $A_0=I$, and nc matrix-valued polynomials
the certificates of positivity were established by Helton, Klep and McCollough
in a series of articles with the use of the theory of complete positivity from
operator algebras and classical separation arguments from real algebraic
geometry. Since the full strength of the theory of complete positivity is not
restricted to finite dimensions, but works well also in the
infinite-dimensional setting, we use it to tackle our problems. First we extend
the characterization of the inclusion $D_{L_1}\subseteq D_{L_2}$ from monic
LMIs to monic LOIs. As a corollary one obtains the description of a polar dual
of a free Hilbert spectrahedron $D_L$ and its projection, called a free Hilbert
spectrahedrop. Using this characterization in a separation argument, we obtain
a certificate for multivariate matrix-valued nc polynomials $F$ positive
semidefinite on a free Hilbert spectrahedron defined by a monic LOI. Replacing
the separation argument by an operator Fej\'er-Riesz theorem enables us to
extend this certificate, in the univariate case, to operator-valued polynomials
$F$. Finally, focusing on the algebraic description of the equality
$D_{L_1}=D_{L_2}$, we remove the assumption of boundedness from the description
in the LMIs case by an extended analysis. However, the description does not
extend to LOIs.

sample size is not large enough to guarantee a good agreement between the exact
distribution of the test statistic and the corresponding chi-squared asymptotic
distribution. Bartlett and Bartlett-type corrections typically attenuate the
size distortion of the tests. These corrections are available in the literature
for the likelihood ratio and score tests in symmetric linear regression models.
Here, we derive a Bartlett-type correction for the gradient test. We show that
the corrections are also valid for the log-symmetric linear regression models.
We numerically compare the various tests, and bootstrapped tests, through

exhibit type I probability error closer to the chosen nominal level with

considered. Different from many existing works on Nash equilibrium seeking in
non-cooperative games, the players considered in this paper cannot directly
observe the actions of the players who are not their neighbors. Instead, the
players are supposed to be capable of communicating with each other via an
undirected and connected communication graph. By a synthesis of a
leader-following consensus protocol and the gradient play, a distributed Nash
equilibrium seeking strategy is proposed for the non-cooperative games.
Analytical analysis on the convergence of the players' actions to the Nash
equilibrium is conducted via Lyapunov stability analysis. For games with
non-quadratic payoffs, where multiple isolated Nash equilibria may coexist in
the game, a local convergence result is derived under certain conditions. Then,
a stronger condition is provided to derive a non-local convergence result for
the non-quadratic games. For quadratic games, it is shown that the proposed
seeking strategy enables the players' actions to converge to the Nash
equilibrium globally under the given conditions. Numerical examples are

schemes, the free-stream preservation property, whose importance has been
widely recognized in recent years, has been developed into a focus of study..
In past literatures, only central schemes are considered to be suitable for
free-stream preservation. In this study, the methodology for arbitrary linear
schemes to achieve the property is investigated. First, derivations of grid
metric by Thomas, Lombard and Neier are reviewed, through which linear schemes
for the metric and unsplit flux could attain the property by the proof of
Vinokur and Yee firstly. In practical applications, flux splittings are usually
at presence and therefore the direct use of upwind schemes seems difficult to
fulfill free-stream preservation. To overcome the difficulty, two attempts are
made: firstly, a central-scheme-decomposition is worked out, through which a
central difference scheme is derived to approximate the first-order partial
derivative in metric evaluations; secondly, treatments are proposed for flux
splitting and a concrete example is presented. Through these two attempts, the
linear upwind node schemes can achieve the property. For half-node or mixed
type schemes, interpolations should be used to derive variables at half nodes.
As a result, a directionally consistent interpolation is proposed, which is
shown to be necessary in order to avoid violation of the metric identity and
free-stream preservation. Two numerical problems are also tested, i.e., the
free-stream and vortex preservation on wavy, largely randomized and triangular
grids. Numerical results validate aforementioned theoretical outcomes;
especially, simulations on the triangular grids indicate the methods discussed
in this study, which are typical algorithms on structured grids, has the
application potential for problems on unstructured meshes.

which generate endogenous oscillations with ~24 h periodicity and thereby
synchronize biological processes to diurnal environmental fluctuations.
Recently, it has become clear that plants harbor more complex gene regulatory
circuits within the core circadian clocks than other organisms, inspiring a
fundamental question: are all these regulatory interactions between clock genes
equally crucial for the establishment and maintenance of circadian rhythms? Our
mechanistic simulation for Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrates that at least half
of the total regulatory interactions must be present to express the circadian
molecular profiles observed in wild-type plants. A set of those essential
interactions is called herein a kernel of the circadian system. The kernel
structure unbiasedly reveals four interlocked negative feedback loops
contributing to circadian rhythms, and three feedback loops among them drive
the autonomous oscillation itself. Strikingly, the kernel structure, as well as
the whole clock circuitry, is overwhelmingly composed of inhibitory, rather
than activating, interactions between genes. We found that this tendency
underlies plant circadian molecular profiles which often exhibit
sharply-shaped, cuspidate waveforms. Through the generation of these cuspidate
profiles, inhibitory interactions may facilitate the global coordination of
temporally-distant clock events that are markedly peaked at very specific times
of day. Our systematic approach resulting in experimentally-testable
predictions provides insights into a design principle of biological clockwork,
with implications for synthetic biology.

system. In experimentally accessible parameter regimes, we show that critical
temperature of the bipartite continuous variable entanglement in our scheme can
be raised from previous 24 K [Vitali {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett.

transfer based on this coupled system. The scheme can be used for the
realization of quantum memories for continuous variable quantum information

originating from the localized carriers moving between the sites which host
random magnetic fields. Due to disorder in the site positions and energies, the
on-site residence times, \tau, are widely spread according to the Levy
distribution. The power-law tail \propto \tau^{-1-\alpha} in the distribution
of waiting times does not affect the conventional spectral narrowing for \alpha
>2, but leads to a dramatic acceleration of the free induction decay in the
domain 2>\alpha >1. The next abrupt acceleration of the decay takes place as
the tail parameter, \alpha, becomes smaller than 1. In the latter domain the
decay does not follow a simple-exponent law. To capture the behavior of the
average spin in this domain, we solve the evolution equation for the average
spin using the approach different from the conventional approach based on the
Laplace transform. Unlike the free induction decay, the tail in the
distribution of the residence times leads to the slow decay of the spin echo.
The echo is dominated by realizations of the carrier motion for which the
number of sites, visited by the carrier, is minimal.

spin-1 Bose gases in one dimensional harmonic potential in the full interacting
regimes. The ground state is obtained by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in the
Hilbert space composed of the lowest eigenstates of noninteracting Bose gas and

interaction the total density profiles evolve from Gaussian-like distribution
to a Fermi-like shell structure of $N$ peaks with the increasing of
spin-independent interaction. While the increasing spin-exchange interaction
always weaken the fermionization of density distribution such that the total
density profiles show shell structure of less peaks and even show single peak

on both hiring outcomes and scholarly productivity for 2659 tenure-track

the multi-dimensional nature of gender inequality in computer science faculty
hiring through a network model of the hiring process. Overall, we find that
hiring outcomes are most directly affected by (i) the relative prestige between
hiring and placing institutions and (ii) the scholarly productivity of the
candidates. After including these, and other features, the addition of gender
did not significantly reduce modeling error. However, gender differences do
exist, e.g., in scholarly productivity, postdoctoral training rates, and in
career movements up the rankings of universities, suggesting that the effects
of gender are indirectly incorporated into hiring decisions through gender's
covariates. Furthermore, we find evidence that more highly ranked departments
recruit female faculty at higher than expected rates, which appears to inhibit
similar efforts by lower ranked departments. These findings illustrate the
subtle nature of gender inequality in faculty hiring networks and provide new

show that local observation is useful to define the phase of such a system in
association with the well-defined phase of the system on the Bethe lattice,
that is, an infinite regular tree without boundary. Above the percolation
threshold, the PDFs of the vertex at the center of the CT (the origin) and of
the vertices near the boundary of the CT (the leaves) have different forms,
which are also dissimilar to the PDF observed in the ordinary percolating phase
of a Euclidean lattice. The PDF for the origin of the CT is bimodal: a decaying
exponential function and a system-size-dependent asymmetric peak, which obeys a
finite-size-scaling law with a fractal exponent. These modes are respectively
related to the PDFs of the finite and infinite clusters in the nonuniqueness
phase of the Bethe lattice. On the other hand, the PDF for the leaf of the CT
is a decaying power function. This is similar to the PDF observed at a critical

the Compton shoulder relatively weak. Also, shape of Compton shoulder depends

(BVD), for reconstructions that minimize the discontinuities (jumps) at cell
interfaces in Godunov type schemes. It is motivated by the observation that
diminishing the jump at the cell boundary might effectively reduce the
dissipation in numerical flux. Different from the existing practices which seek
high-order polynomials within mesh cells while assuming discontinuities being
always at the cell interfaces, we proposed a new strategy that combines a
high-order polynomial-based interpolation and a jump-like reconstruction that
allows a discontinuity being partly represented within the mesh cell rather
than at the interface. It is shown that new schemes of high fidelity for both
continuous and discontinuous solutions can be devised by the BVD guideline with
properly-chosen candidate reconstruction schemes. Excellent numerical results
have been obtained for both scalar and Euler conservation laws with
substantially improved solution quality in comparison with the existing
methods. This work provides a simple and accurate alternative of great
practical significance to the current Godunov paradigm which overly pursues the
smoothness within mesh cell under the questionable premiss that discontinuities
only appear at cell interfaces.

detection of the oceanic rogue waves is to measure the triangular Fourier
spectra which begin to appear at the early stages of their development. For the
early detection of the rogue waves it is possible to treat such a spectrum as a
sparse signal since we would mainly be interested in the high amplitude
triangular region located at the central wavenumber. Therefore compressive
sampling can be a very efficient tool for the rogue wave early warning systems.
Compressed measurements can be acquired by remote sensing techniques such as
coherent SAR which measure the ocean surface envelope or by insitu techniques
such as spectra measuring tools mounted on a ship hull or bottom mounted
pressure gauges. By employing a numerical approach we show that triangular
Fourier spectra can be sensed by compressive measurements at the early stages

Akhmediev-Peregrine solitons. Our results may lead to development of the early
warning hardware systems which use the compressive sampling thus the memory

Moreover, we explain the appearance of terminal objects noted in [Mar15]. We

frequency comb generation, via dissipative soliton formation. To achieve a
higher Q and obtain the necessary anomalous dispersion, $Si_3N_4$
microresonators made of multi-mode waveguides were previously implemented.
However, coupling between different transverse mode families in the multi-mode
waveguides results in periodic disruption of dispersion and quality factor,
introducing perturbation to dissipative soliton formation and amplitude
modulation to the corresponding spectrum. Careful choice of pump wavelength to
avoid the mode crossing region is thus critical in conventional $Si_3N_4$
microresonators. Here, we report a novel design of $Si_3N_4$ microresonator
such that single mode operation, high quality factor, and anomalous dispersion
are attained simultaneously. The microresonator is consisted of uniform single
mode waveguides in the semi-circle region, to eliminate bending induced mode
coupling, and adiabatically tapered waveguides in the straight region, to avoid
excitation of higher order modes. The intrinsic Q of the microresonator reaches
$1.36 \times 10^6$ while the GVD remains to be anomalous at $-50 fs^2/mm$. We
demonstrate, with this novel microresonator, broadband phase-locked Kerr
frequency combs with flat and smooth spectra can be generated by pumping at any
resonances in the optical C-band.

of first order phase transition is the appearance of a bimodal distribution in
$P_m(k)$ in finite systems. Here P_m(k) is the probability that the maximum of
the multiplicity distribution occurs at mass number k. Using a well-known model
for event generation (BUU plus fluctuation), we do two cases of central
collision: mass 40 on mass 40 and mass 120 on mass 120. Bimodality is seen in
both the cases. The results are quite similar to those obtained in statistical
model calculations.
  An intriguing feature is seen. We observe that at the energy where bimodality
occurs. other phase transition like signatures appear. There are breaks in
certain first order derivatives. We then examine if such breaks appear in
standard Botzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) calculations without fluctuations.
They do. The implication is interesting. If first order phase transition
occurs, it may be possible to recognise that from ordinary BUU calculation.
Probably the reason this was not seen already is because this aspect was not
investigated before.

increasing the density), the anisotropic tetrahedral network structure observed
in the original CP model transforms into the isotropic structure with the

gap between the network and isotropic glass formers and to obtain the insight
into the underlying mechanism of the fragility. We study the relationship
between the fragility and dynamical properties such as the magnitude of the
Stokes-Einstein violation and the stretch exponent in the density correlation
function. We also demonstrate that the peak of the specific heat systematically
shifts as the density increases, hinting that the fragility is correlated with
the hidden thermodynamic anomalies of the system.

different from what we know for MS hosts has been recently reported. We aim to
test whether evolved stars with planets show any chemical peculiarity that
could be related to the planet formation process. We determine in a consistent
way the metallicity and individual abundances of a large sample of evolved
(subgiants and red giants) and MS stars with and without known planetary
companions. No differences in the <[X/Fe]> vs. condensation temperature (Tc)
slopes are found between the samples of planet and non-planet hosts when all
elements are considered. However, if the analysis is restricted to only
refractory elements, differences in the Tc-slopes between stars with and
without known planets are found. This result is found to be dependent on the
stellar evolutionary stage, as it holds for MS and subgiant stars, while there
seem to be no difference between planet and non-planet hosts among the sample
of giants. A search for correlations between the Tc-slope and the stellar
properties reveals significant correlations with the stellar mass and the
stellar age. The data also suggest that differences in terms of mass and age
between MS planet and non-planet hosts may be present. Our results are well
explained by radial mixing in the Galaxy. The sample of giant contains stars
more massive and younger than their MS counterparts. This leads to a sample of
stars possibly less contaminated by stars not born in the solar neighbourhood,
leading to no chemical differences between planet and non planet hosts. The
sample of MS stars may contain more stars from the outer disc (specially the
non-planet host sample) which might led to the differences observed in the
chemical trends.

network undergoing small deformations, based on the rate of breaking and
re-forming of network crosslinks and the evolving elastic reference state. In
this framework, the characteristics of the deformed transient network at
microscopic and macroscopic scales are naturally unified. Microscopically, the
breakage rate of the crosslinks is affected by the local force acting on the
chain. Macroscopically, we use the classical continuum model for rubber
elasticity to describe the structure of the deformation energy, whose reference
state is defined dynamically according to when crosslinks are broken and
formed. With this, the constitutive relation can be obtained. We study three
applications of the theory in uniaxial stretching geometry: for the stress
relaxation after an instantaneous step strain is imposed, for the stress
overshoot and subsequent decay in the plastic regime when a strain ramp is
applied, and for the cycle of stretching and release. We compare the model
predictions with experimental data on stress relaxation and stress overshoot in
physically bonded thermoplastic elastomers and in vitrimer networks.

the presence of additional modes and/or modulation, and another limited to
strict single-mode pulsation. The presence of additional modes and multiple
modulations in RRab stars allowed us to construct Petersen diagrams for these

origin of the Moon. Most of the numerical simulations of GI have been carried
out with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. Recently, however,
it has been pointed out that standard formulation of SPH (SSPH) has
difficulties in the treatment of a contact discontinuity such as a core-mantle
boundary and a free surface such as a planetary surface. This difficulty comes
from the assumption of differentiability of density in SSPH. We have developed
an alternative formulation of SPH, density independent SPH (DISPH), which is
based on differentiability of pressure instead of density to solve the problem
of a contact discontinuity. In this paper, we report the results of the GI
simulations with DISPH and compare them with those obtained with SSPH. We found
that the disk properties, such as mass and angular momentum produced by DISPH
is different from that of SSPH. In general, the disks formed by DISPH are more
compact: while formation of a smaller mass moon for low-oblique impacts is
expected with DISPH, inhibition of ejection would promote formation of a larger
mass moon for high-oblique impacts. Since only the improvement of core-mantle
boundary significantly affects the properties of circumplanetary disks
generated by GI and DISPH has not been significantly improved from SSPH for a
free surface, we should be very careful when some conclusions are drawn from
the numerical simulations for GI. And it is necessary to develop the numerical
hydrodynamical scheme for GI that can properly treat the free surface as well
as the contact discontinuity.

to a scalar modelthat depends on two parameters: the angular frequency $k$ and
the half-thickness $\varepsilon$. Optimizing $k$ for each chosen $\varepsilon$,

that in many cases the constructed eigenpair corresponds to the first eigenpair

The Gaussian curvature has to be nonnegative and the azimuthal curvature has to
dominate the meridian curvature in any point of the midsurface. In this case,

consequences on the GPs that need to be better understood.The two principal

and ii) adding a positive constant to the diagonal (the so-called nugget
regularization).The first part of this paper provides an algebraic comparison
of PI and nugget regularizations. Redundant points, responsible for covariance
matrix singularity, are defined. It is proven that pseudoinverse
regularization, contrarily to nugget regularization, averages the output values
and makes the variance zero at redundant points. However, pseudoinverse and
nugget regularizations become equivalent as the nugget value vanishes. A
measure for data-model discrepancy is proposed which serves for choosing a
regularization technique.In the second part of the paper, a distribution-wise
GP is introduced that interpolates Gaussian distributions instead of data
points. Distribution-wise GP can be seen as an improved regularization method
for GPs.

claimed to be well-suited to IoT applications but a lack of detail in available

have emerged after a tag authentication protocol built using the Algebraic
Eraser was proposed for standardization in ISO/IEC SC31 and SecureRF provided
an open public description of the protocol. In this paper we describe a range
of attacks on this protocol that include very efficient and practical tag
impersonation as well as partial, and total, tag secret key recovery. Most of
these results have been practically verified, they contrast with the 80-bit
security that is claimed for the protocol, and they emphasize the importance of
independent public review for any cryptographic proposal.

strictly zero due to symmetry. We further analyze this effect in presence of

40 dB can be achieved in state-of-the art systems. Due to the small mode
volumes and high quality factors, our system is also expected to have a
generation efficiency much higher than in standard micro-ring systems. Those
two considerations make a strong case for the integration of our proposed

optimal input. In Layman terms we prove that the support of the optimal input
is bounded whenever the cost grows faster than a cut-off rate equal to the
logarithm of the noise PDF evaluated at the input-output function. Furthermore,
we prove a converse statement that says whenever the cost grows slower than the
cut-off rate, the optimal input has necessarily an unbounded support. In
addition, we show how the discreteness of the optimal input is guaranteed
whenever the triplet satisfy some analyticity properties. We argue that a
suitable cost function to be imposed on the channel input is one that grows
similarly to the cut-off rate. Our results are valid for any cost function that
is super-logarithmic. They summarize a large number of previous channel

show clear zero resistivity and corresponding magnetic susceptibility drop at
around 10-14 K. The Fe1.1Se0.33Te0.67 sample shows the highest onset Tc of
about 14 K, and its upper critical field is estimated to be approximately 54 T.
Compared with conventional solid state reaction for preparing polycrystalline
FeSe samples, combustion synthesis exhibits much-reduced time and energy
consumption, but offers comparable superconducting properties. It is expected
that the combustion synthesis method is available for preparing plenty of
iron-based superconductors, and in this direction further related work is in
progress.

described by the general Markovian master equation. We illustrate the theory by
using the rate equation to compute the tunnelling time distribution for
electron transport through a molecular junction. The tunnelling time
distribution is exponential, which indicates that Markovian quantum tunnelling
is a Poissonian statistical process. The tunnelling time distribution is used
not only to study the quantum statistics of tunnelling along the average
electric current but also to analyse extreme quantum events where an electron
jumps against the applied voltage bias. The average tunnelling time shows
distinctly different temperature dependance for p- and n-type molecular

molecular orbitals relative to the electrode Fermi energy.

sectors and the charged lepton sector in the standard model can be parametrized
well by a parameter $\lambda$ which is usually taken to be the sine of the
Cabibbo angle ($\lambda = \sin\theta_\text{C} \simeq 0.225$). However, in the
neutrino sector, there is still room to realize the two neutrino mass squared
differences $\Delta m_\text{sol}^2$ and $\Delta m_\text{atm}^2$, two large
mixing angles $\theta _{12}$ and $\theta _{23}$, and non-zero $\theta _{13}$.
Then we consider an extension with an additional parameter $\rho$ in addition
to $\lambda$. Taking the relevant FN charges for a power of $\lambda~(=0.225)$
and additional FN charges for a power of $\rho$, which we assume to be less
than one, we can reproduce the ratio of the two neutrino mass squared
differences and three mixing angles. In the normal neutrino mass hierarchy, we
show several patterns for taking relevant FN charges and the magnitude of
$\rho$. We find that if $\sin \theta_{23}$ is measured more precisely, we can
distinguish each pattern. This is testable in the near future, for example in
neutrino oscillation experiments. In addition, we predict the Dirac
CP-violating phase for each pattern.

diffusive or boson-assisted in the weakly fermion-boson coupled,
fluctuation-dominated or strongly correlated regimes, respectively. Thereby
correlated transport is not only assisted but also limited by the bosonic

The most probable wetting path across surface heterogeneities is identified by
combining, within an innovative approach, microscopic classical density
functional theory and the string method devised for the study of rare events.
The computed rugged free energy landscape demonstrates that hysteresis emerges
as a consequence of metastable pinning of the liquid front at the defects; the
barriers for thermally activated defect crossing, the pinning force, and
hysteresis are quantified and related to the geometry and chemistry of the
defects allowing for the occurrence of nanoscopic effects. The main result of
our calculations is that even weak nanoscale defects, which are difficult to

Wolfgang Pauli in 1925. Since then, several experiments have checked its
validity. From 2006 until 2010, the VIP (VIolation of the Pauli Principle)
experiment took data at the LNGS underground laboratory to test the PEP. This
experiment looked for electronic 2p to 1s transitions in copper, where 2
electrons are in the 1s state before the transition happens. These transitions
violate the PEP. The lack of detection of X-ray photons coming from these
transitions resulted in a preliminary upper limit for the violation of the PEP
of $4.7 \times 10^{-29}$. Currently, the successor experiment VIP2 is under
preparation. The main improvements are, on one side, the use of Silicon Drift
Detectors (SDDs) as X-ray photon detectors. On the other side an active
shielding is implemented, which consists of plastic scintillator bars read by
Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). The employment of these detectors will
improve the upper limit for the violation of the PEP by around 2 orders of
magnitude.

performance of fully submerged propellers have been available since the 1950s.
I present two new scale-free hydrodynamic predictions for the relative
performance of both submerged and surface-piercing propellers. Larger p/D
(pitch to diameter ratio) are more favorable for peak peopeller efficiency and
higher speeds; lower p/D are more favorable for carrying loads at low speeds.
This conflicts with the common advice to swing as large a diameter as slowly as
possible but diameter D has dimensions while p/D is dimensionless, and useful
hydrodynamic recommendations must be given in terms of dimensionless variables.
For the surface piercing case I compare my scaling predictions with empirical
data using a single case in each class as a baseline. One scaling law allows
propeller diameter to be predicted from an established baseline where shaft hp
and shaft RPM are the variables. The second prediction is inferred from Froude
nr. scaling and allows boat speed to be predicted based on shaft horsepower
(shp) and weight, given a known baseline in the same class of drag coefficient.
I also discuss the existing available data on surface piercing propellers and
compare the data with both typical competition data and speed records. In the
context of the p/D ratio I discuss the limits on both too high and too low gear
ratios. I state for the first time a basic requirement for setting the leading
edge camber of surface piercing propellers for optimal acceleration and top
speed. I end by using the basic hydrodynamic ideas of circulation conservation
and vortex stretching to provide a qualitative picture via the tip vortices of
the physics of blade ventilation in surface piercing.

the testing of our understanding of stellar evolution on thousands of stars.
Evolutionary models typically require five input parameters, the mass, initial
Helium abundance, initial metallicity, mixing- length (assumed to be constant
over time), and the age to which the star must be evolved. Some of these
parameters are also very useful in characterizing the associated planets and in
studying galactic archaeology. How to obtain these parameters from observations
rapidly and accurately, specifically in the context of surveys of thousands of
stars, is an outstanding ques- tion, one that has eluded straightforward
resolution. For a given star, we typically measure the effective temperature
and surface metallicity spectroscopically and low-degree oscillation
frequencies through space observatories. Here we demonstrate that statistical
learning, using artificial neural networks, is successful in determining the
evolutionary parameters based on spectroscopic and seismic measurements. Our
trained networks show robustness over a broad range of parameter space, and
critically, are entirely computationally inexpensive and fully automated. We
analyze the observations of a few stars using this method and the results com-
pare well to inferences obtained using other techniques. This method is both
computationally cheap and inferentially accurate, paving the way for analyzing
the vast quantities of stellar observations from past, current, and future

different parameters that need to be tuned jointly. In this report, we focus on
the category of EEG-based BCIs that rely on Steady-State-Visual-Evoked

has positive measure but there are examples where the intersection of the basin

We provide conditions, involving the existence of an unstable interior Nash

equilibrium under replicator and best-response dynamics to intersect in a set
of positive measure. Hence, for any choice of initial conditions in sets of
positive measure, if a pure Nash equilibrium is locally stable, the outcome of
learning under either procedure coincides. We provide examples illustrating the
above, including some for which the basins of attraction exactly coincide for
both learning dynamics. We explore the role that indifference sets play in the
coincidence of the basins of attraction of the stable Nash equilibria.

are taken into account. In the Markov limit, rates for the electron-impurity
spin transfer can be derived for electron spins parallel and perpendicular to
the impurity spins corresponding to measurable decay rates in Kerr experiments
in Faraday and Voigt geometry. Our rigorous microscopic quantum kinetic
treatment automatically accounts for the fact that, in an individual spin
flip-flop scattering process, a spin flip of an electron is necessarily
accompanied by a flop of an impurity spin in the opposite direction and the
corresponding change of the impurity Zeeman energy influences the final energy
of the electron after the scattering event. This shift in the electron energies
after a spin flip-flop scattering processes, which usually has been overlooked
in the literature, turns out to be especially important in the case of
extremely diluted magnetic semiconductors in an external magnetic field. As a
specific example for a $\mathbf{k}$-dependent effective magnetic field the
effects of a Rashba field on the dynamics of the carrier-impurity correlations

although accounting for the Rashba interaction in the dynamics of the

expectation value for the stress tensor of a scalar field with arbitrary

only one spatial coordinate. We regulate the expressions by incorporating a
temporal-spatial cutoff in the (imaginary) time and transverse-spatial
directions. The divergences are captured by the zeroth- and second-order WKB
approximations. Then the stress tensor is ""renormalized"" by omitting the terms
that depend on the cutoff. The ambiguities that inevitably arise in this
procedure are both duly noted and restricted by imposing certain physical
conditions; one result is that the renormalized stress tensor exhibits the
expected trace anomaly. The renormalized stress tensor exhibits no pressure
anomaly, in that the principle of virtual work is satisfied for motions in a
transverse direction. We then consider a potential that defines a wall, a
one-dimensional potential that vanishes for $z<0$ and rises like $z^\alpha$,
$\alpha>0$, for $z>0$. The full finite stress tensor is computed numerically
for the two cases where explicit solutions to the differential equation are
available, $\alpha=1$ and 2. The energy density exhibits an inverse linear
divergence as the boundary is approached from the inside for a linear
potential, and a logarithmic divergence for a quadratic potential. Finally, the
interaction between two such walls is computed, and it is shown that the
attractive Casimir pressure between the two walls also satisfies the principle

eliminates quantum channels as structureless reservoirs in a Born-Markov

dense subset turn out to be quite different since the ""pointwise"" argument does
not work in the noncommutative setting; to obtain the uniform convergence in
the largest spaces, we show maximal inequality between the Orlicz spaces, which
can not be deduced easily using classical extrapolation argument. Junge and
Xu's noncommutative maximal inequalities with optimal order, together with the
atomic decomposition of Orlicz spaces, play an essential role in overcoming the

either one source transmits to a spatial density of receivers or a density of
transmitters transmit to a unique receiver.This approach is built upon the
classical broadcast channel (BC) and multiple access channel (MAC). For the
sake of consistency, the study is limited to Gaussian channels with power
constraints and is restricted to the asymptotic regime (zero-error
capacity).The reference scenario comprises one base station (BS) in Tx or Rx
mode, a spatial random distribution of nodes (resp. in Rx or Tx mode)
characterized by a probability spatial density $u(x)$ and a request for a
quantity of information with no delay constraint. This system is modeled as an
$\infty-$user asymmetric channel (BC or MAC). To derive the properties of this
model, a spatial discretization is performed and the equivalence with either a
BC or MAC is established. A discretization sequence is then defined to refine
infinitely the approximation. Achievability and capacity results are obtained
in the limit of this sequence. The uniform capacity is then defined as the
maximal symmetric achievable rate at which the distributed users can
transmit/receive with no delay constraint.The capacity region is also
established as the set of information distributions that are achievable. The
tightness of these limits and their practical interest are briefly illustrated

generally best possible (halving the known ones). We shall further study other
aspects of the continued fraction, like the growth of the heights of partial

rational ones which occur infinitely many times. (This is crucial for
applications to a function field version of a question of McMullen.) Our

$J_3$. First, some possible instabilities of these phases are identified for
$n=2$ in large $S$ expansions up to the linear spin-wave corrections. Then,
using a fermionic representation of the $SU({\rm n})$ spin operators for

spin-liquid (SL) solutions are stabilized for ${\rm n}\ge 10$. The SL solution
governed by $J_1$ breaks the lattice translation symmetry. This Modulated SL is

orthoferrite TbFeO$_3$ studied using neutron powder diffraction are reported.
Magnetic phase transitions are identified at $T^\mathrm{Fe/Mn}_N \approx$ 295~K
where a paramagnetic-to-antiferromagnetic transition occurs in the Fe/Mn
sublattice, $T^\mathrm{Fe/Mn}_{SR} \approx$ 26~K where a spin-reorientation
transition occurs in the Fe/Mn sublattice and $T^\mathrm{R}_N \approx$ 2~K
where Tb-ordering starts to manifest. At 295~K, the magnetic structure of the
Fe/Mn sublattice in TbFe$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$O$_3$ belongs to the irreducible
representation $\Gamma_4$ ($G_xA_yF_z$ or $Pb'n'm$). A mixed-domain structure
of ($\Gamma_1 + \Gamma_4$) is found at 250~K which remains stable down to the
spin re-orientation transition at $T^\mathrm{Fe/Mn}_{SR}\approx$ 26~K. Below
26~K and above 250~K, the majority phase ($> 80\%$) is that of $\Gamma_4$.
Below 10~K the high-temperature phase $\Gamma_4$ remains stable till 2~K. At
2~K, Tb develops a magnetic moment value of 0.6(2)~$\mu_\mathrm{B}/$f.u. and
orders long-range in $F_z$ compatible with the $\Gamma_4$ representation. Our
study confirms the magnetic phase transitions reported already in a single
crystal of TbFe$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$O$_3$ and, in addition, reveals the presence
of mixed magnetic domains. The ratio of these magnetic domains as a function of
temperature is estimated from Rietveld refinement of neutron diffraction data.
Indications of short-range magnetic correlations are present in the low-$Q$
region of the neutron diffraction patterns at $T < T^\mathrm{Fe/Mn}_{SR}$.
These results should motivate further experimental work devoted to measure
electric polarization and magnetocapacitance of TbFe$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$O$_3$.

electrodynamics is justified. They all have in common that their fundamental

$\textrm{d} H = J$ and a constitutive law $H = # F$ which relates the field
strength two-form $F$ and the excitation two-form $H$. A local and linear
constitutive law defines what is called local and linear pre-metric
electrodynamics whose best known application are the effective description of
electrodynamics inside media including, e.g., birefringence. We analyze the
classical theory of the electromagnetic potential $A$ before we use methods
familiar from mathematical quantum field theory in curved spacetimes to
quantize it in a locally covariant way. Our analysis of the classical theory
contains the derivation of retarded and advanced propagators, the analysis of
the causal structure on the basis of the constitutive law (instead of a metric)
and a discussion of the classical phase space. This classical analysis sets the
stage for the construction of the quantum field algebra and quantum states.
Here one sees, among other things, that a microlocal spectrum condition can be

no annotations, but abundant unlabeled data. The setting exists in many tasks
such as semi-supervised image classification, image clustering, and image
retrieval. Unlike previous methods, which develop or learn sophisticated
regularizers for classifiers, our method learns a new image representation by
exploiting the distribution patterns of all available data for the task at
hand. Particularly, a rich set of visual prototypes are sampled from all
available data, and are taken as surrogate classes to train discriminative
classifiers; images are projected via the classifiers; the projected values,
similarities to the prototypes, are stacked to build the new feature vector.
The training set is noisy. Hence, in the spirit of ensemble learning we create
a set of such training sets which are all diverse, leading to diverse
classifiers. The method is dubbed Ensemble Projection (EP). EP captures not
only the characteristics of individual images, but also the relationships among
images. It is conceptually simple and computationally efficient, yet effective
and flexible. Experiments on eight standard datasets show that: (1) EP
outperforms previous methods for semi-supervised image classification; (2) EP
produces promising results for self-taught image classification, where
unlabeled samples are a random collection of images rather than being from the
same distribution as the labeled ones; and (3) EP improves over the original
features for image clustering. The code of the method is available on the
project page.

interfaces is of central importance for controlling a large variety of
molecular-based devices such as organic light emitting diodes, nanoscale
organic spin-valves and single-molecule switches. One of the primary
experimental methods to reveal the mechanisms behind electronic transport
through metal-molecule interfaces is the study of conductance as a function of
molecule length in molecular junctions. Previous studies focused on transport
governed either by tunneling or hopping, both at low conductance. However, the
upper limit of conductance across molecular junctions has not been explored,
despite the great potential for efficient information transfer, charge
injection and recombination processes. Here, we study the conductance
properties of highly transmitting metal-molecule-metal interfaces, using a
series of single-molecule junctions based on oligoacenes with increasing
length. We find that the conductance saturates at an upper limit where it is
independent of molecule length. Furthermore, we show that this upper limit can
be controlled by the character of the orbital hybridization at the
metal-molecule interface. Using two prototype systems, in which the molecules
are contacted by either Ag or Pt electrodes, we reveal two different origins
for the saturation of conductance. In the case of Ag-based molecular junctions,
the conductance saturation is ascribed to a competition between energy level
alignment and level broadening, while in the case of Pt-based junctions, the
saturation is attributed to a band-like transport. The results are explained by
an intuitive model, backed by ab-initio transport calculations. Our findings
shed light on the mechanisms that constrain the conductance at the high
transmission limit, providing guiding principles for the design of highly
conductive metal-molecule interfaces.

solving a class of composite optimization problems where the objective function
consists of a (weakly) smooth term and a (strongly) convex regularization term.
While including a strongly convex term in the subproblems of the classical
conditional gradient (CG) method improves its rate of convergence, it does not
cost per iteration as much as general proximal type algorithms. More
specifically, we present a unified analysis for the CGT method in the sense
that it achieves the best-known rate of convergence when the weakly smooth term
is nonconvex and possesses (nearly) optimal complexity if it turns out to be
convex. While implementation of the CGT method requires explicitly estimating
problem parameters like the level of smoothness of the first term in the
objective function, we also present a few variants of this method which relax
such estimation. Unlike general proximal type parameter free methods, these

However, when tilting and rotation angles appear on the scene, a combination of
the revised GGAs with the hybrid scheme becomes the most preferable option. It
is important to note that a worse performance of LDA functional is somewhat
compensated by its realistic reproduction of electronic and magnetic structure
of SrRuO$_3$, making it a strong competitor if the physical features are also

families of L-functions, it frequently cannot see the family's arithmetic. In
some situations this requires an extended theory that inserts arithmetic
factors depending on the family, while in other cases these factors result in
contributions which vanish in the limit, and are thus not detected. We review
the general theory associated to one of the most important statistics, the
n-level density of zeros near the central point. According to the Katz-Sarnak
density conjecture, to each family of L-functions there is a corresponding
symmetry group such that the behavior of zeros near the central point as the
conductors tend to infinity agrees with the behavior of eigenvalues near 1 as
the matrix size tends to infinity. We show how these calculations are done,
emphasizing the techniques, methods and obstructions to improving the results,
by considering in full detail a family of Dirichlet characters. We then
describe how we may associate a symmetry constant to each family, and how to
determine the symmetry group of a compound family in terms of the symmetries of
the constituents. These calculations explain the remarkable universality of
behavior, where the main terms are independent of the arithmetic (only the
first two moments of the Satake parameters contribute in the limit; similar to
the Central Limit Theorem, the higher moments are only felt in the rate of
convergence). We end by exploring lower order terms in families of elliptic
curves. We present evidence supporting a conjecture that the average second
moment in one-parameter families without complex multiplication has, when
appropriately viewed, a negative bias, and end with a discussion of the
consequences of this bias on the distribution of low-lying zeros, in particular
relations between such a bias and the observed excess rank in families.

investigating the dynamics of excitons in reduced dimensions and fundamental
many-body interactions. However, on the other hand, the quasi-1D excitonic
nature can limit the luminescence quantum yield significantly. Here, we report
exciton brightening in monolayer phosphorene achieved via the dimensionality
modification of excitons from quasi-1D to zero-dimensional (0D), through the
transference of monolayer phosphorene samples onto defect-rich oxide substrate
deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The resultant
interfacial luminescent local states lead to exciton localization and trigger
efficient photon emissions at a new wavelength of ~920 nm. The luminescence
quantum yield of 0D-like localized excitons is measured to be at least 33.6
times larger than that of intrinsic quasi-1D free excitons in monolayer
phosphorene. This is primarily due to the reduction of non-radiative decay rate
and the possibly enhanced radiative recombination probability. Owing to the
large trapping energy, this new photon emission from the localized excitons in
monolayer phosphorene can be observed at elevated temperature, which contrasts
markedly with defect-induced photon emission from transition metal
dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductor monolayers that can only be observed at
cryogenic temperatures. Our findings introduce new avenues for the development
of novel photonic devices based on monolayer phosphorene, such as near-infrared
lighting devices that are operable at elevated temperature. More importantly,
2D phosphorene with quasi-1D free excitons and 0D-like localized excitons
provides a unique platform to investigate the fundamental phenomena in the
ideal 2D-1D-0D hybrid system.

state of ultra-cold atoms in a deep hexagonal optical lattice. The dynamical
evolution is triggered by a quench of the lattice potential, such that the
interaction strength $U_f$ is much larger than the hopping amplitude $J_f$. The
quench initiates collective oscillations with frequency $|U_f|/(2\pi)$ in the
momentum occupation numbers and imprints an oscillating phase with the same
frequency on the BCS order parameter $\Delta$. The oscillation frequency of
$\Delta$ is not reproduced by treating the time evolution in mean-field theory.
In our theory, the momentum noise (i.e. density-density) correlation functions
oscillate at frequency $|U_f|/2\pi$ as well as at its second harmonic. For a
very deep lattice, with zero tunneling energy, the oscillations of momentum
occupation numbers are undamped. Non-zero tunneling after the quench leads to
dephasing of the different momentum modes and a subsequent damping of the
oscillations. The damping occurs even for a finite-temperature initial BCS
state, but not for a non-interacting Fermi gas. Furthermore, damping is
stronger for larger order parameter and may therefore be used as a signature of
the BCS state. Finally, our theory shows that the noise correlation functions

distribution and configuration of application services and middleware
infrastructure. The considerable complexity of these tasks resulted in the
emergence of declarative JSON-based domain-specific deployment languages to
develop deployment programs. However, existing deployment programs unsafely
compose artifacts written in different languages, leading to bugs that are hard
to detect before run time. Furthermore, deployment languages do not provide
extension points for custom implementations of existing cloud services such as
application-specific load balancing policies.
  To address these shortcomings, we propose CPL (Cloud Platform Language), a
statically-typed core language for programming both distributed applications as
well as their deployment on a cloud platform. In CPL, application services and
deployment programs interact through statically typed, extensible interfaces,
and an application can trigger further deployment at run time. We provide a
formal semantics of CPL and demonstrate that it enables type-safe, composable

We performed simulations of magnetized colliding flows that instead meet at an
oblique-shock layer. Oblique shocks generate shear in the post-shock

formation. As the degree of shear increases (i.e. the obliquity of the shock
increases), we find that it takes longer for sink particles to form, they form
in lower numbers, and they tend to be less massive. With regard to magnetic
fields, we find that even a weak field stalls gravitational collapse within
forming clouds. Additionally, an initially oblique collision interface tends to
reorient over time in the presence of a magnetic field, so that it becomes
normal to the oncoming flows. This was demonstrated by our most oblique shock
interface, which became fully normal by the end of the simulation.

We find that the spacetime has non-physical regions which give rise to event

black hole. The non-physical region in the wormhole configuration decreases
gradually and vanishes for the Hayward parameter $l=0.9$. It is concluded that

relationship and various distance indicators, all of which point to a cosmic
equation of state (EoS) p=-rho/3, where rho and p are, respectively, the total
energy density and pressure of the cosmic fluid. It has recently been shown
that this result is not a coincidence and simply confirms the fact that the
symmetries in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric appear to be viable
only for a medium with zero active mass, i.e., rho+3p=0. In their latest paper,
however, Kim, Lasenby and Hobson have provided what they believe to be a
counter argument to this conclusion. Here, we show that these authors are
merely repeating the conventional mistake of incorrectly placing the observer
simultaneously in a comoving frame, where the lapse function g_tt is coordinate
dependent when rho+3p is not 0, and a supposedly different, free-falling frame,
in which g_tt=1, implying no time dilation. We demonstrate that the Hubble flow
is not inertial when rho+3p is not 0, so the comoving frame is generally not in
free fall, even though in FRW, the comoving and free-falling frames are
supposed to be identical at every spacetime point. So this confusion of frames
not only constitutes an inconsistency with the fundamental tenets of general
relativity but, additionally, there is no possibility of using a gauge
transformation to select a set of coordinates for which g_tt=1 when rho+3p is

retention of ""roadless space"", a concept that is based on distance to the
nearest road from any point. We developed a novel use of the empty space
function - a general statistical tool based on stochastic geometry and random
sets theory - to calculate roadless space in a part of the Congo Basin where
there has recently been rapid expansion of road networks. We compared the
temporal development of roadless space in certified and non-certified logging
concessions inside and outside areas declared as IFL in the year 2000. Between
1999 and 2007, rapid road network expansion led to a marked loss of roadless
space in IFL. After 2007, this trajectory levelled out in most areas, due to an
equilibrium between newly built roads and abandoned roads that became
revegetated. However, concessions within IFL that have been certified by FSC
since around 2007 showed continued decreases in roadless space, thus reaching a
level comparable to all other concessions. Only national parks remained
road-free. We recommend that forest management policies make the preservation
of large connected forest areas a top priority by effectively monitoring - and
limiting - the occupation of space by roads that are permanently accessible.

graph is defined as the graph with one vertex for each set and two vertices are
adjacent precisely when their representing sets have non-empty intersection.
Sometimes these sets are finite, but in many well known examples like geometric
graphs (including interval graphs) they are infinite. One can also study the
reverse problem of expressing the vertices of a given graph as distinct sets in
such a way that adjacency coincides with intersection of the corresponding
sets. The sets are usually required to conform to some template, depending on
the problem, to be either a finite set, or some geometric set like intervals,
circles, discs, cubes etc. The problem of representing a graph as an
intersection graph of sets was first introduced by Erdos and they looked at
minimising the underlying universal set necessary to represent any given graph.
In that paper it was shown that the problem is NP complete. In this paper we
study a natural variant of this problem which is to consider graphs where
vertices represent distinct sets and adjacency coincides with disjointness.
Although this is really the same problem on the complement graph, for specific
families of graphs this is a more natural way of viewing it. When taken across
the spectrum of all graphs the two problems are evidently identical. Our
motivation to look at disjointness instead of intersection is that several well
known graphs like the Petersen graph and Knesser graphs are expressed in the
latter method, and the complements of these families are not well studied. The
parameters we take into account are the maximum size of an individual vertex
label, minimum universe size possible (disregarding individual label sizes) and
versions of these two where it is required that each vertex gets labels of the
same size.

still very hard to master. From a system point of view, the ball behaviour is
in general easy to model but close to the obstacles there are severe
non-linearities. Additionally, the far from flat surface on which the ball
rolls provides for changing dynamics depending on the ball position. The
general dynamics of the system can easliy be handled by traditional automatic
control methods. Taking the obstacles and uneaven surface into accout would
require very detailed models of the system. A simple deterministic control
algorithm is combined with a learning control method. The simple control method
provides initial training data. As the learning method is trained, the system
can learn from the results of its own actions and the performance improves well
beyond the performance of the initial controller. A vision system and image
analysis is used to estimate the ball position while a combination of a PID
