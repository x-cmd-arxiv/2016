different contexts such as nature and society. In this paper, the nodes are
comprised by customers of the bank (legal entities) and the links are
established by payments between these nodes. We study the scaling-free and
structural properties of this network. We also describe its topology,
components and behaviors. We show that this network shares typical structural
characteristics known in other complex networks: degree distributions follow a
power law, low clustering coefficient and low average shortest path length. We
identify the key nodes of the network and perform simulations of resiliency
against random and targeted attacks of the nodes with two different approaches.
With this, we find that by identifying and studying the links between the nodes
is possible to perform vulnerability analysis of the Estonian economy with

formation modeling predicts considerable inhomogeneities of cloud cover,

cannot resolve some existing degeneracies between cloud location and cloud
optical properties.
  We present a conceptually simple technique to detect inhomogeneous cloud
cover on exoplanets. Such an inhomogeneous cloud cover produces an asymmetric
primary transit of the planet in front of the host star. Asymmetric transits
produce characteristic residuals compared to a standard symmetric model.
Furthermore, bisector spans can be used to determine asymmetries in the transit
light curve.
  We apply a model of asymmetric transits to the light curves of HAT-P-7b,
Kepler-7b and HD209458b and search for possible cloud signatures. The nearly
uninterrupted Kepler photometry is particularly well-suited for this method
since it allows for a very high time resolution.
  We do not find any statistically sound cloud signature in the data of the
considered planets. For HAT-P-7b, a tentative detection of an asymmetric cloud
cover is found, consistent with analysis of the optical phase curve. Based on
Bayesian probability arguments, a symmetric model with an offset in the transit
ephemeris remains, however, the most viable model. Still, this work
demonstrates that for suitable targets, namely low-gravity planets around
bright stars, the method can be used to constrain cloud cover characteristics
and is thus a helpful additional tool to study exoplanetary atmospheres.

smaller than the angular momentum expected from the well-known rapid precession

Importantly, this shift contributes to the effective mass even if the system is
linearized in $E_r$, and can be interpreted as a first order linear shift in
the Jacobian. Further, the Jacobian shift recovers the large TP precession flow

granular materials using a volume ensemble of equiprobable jammed states in
analogy to thermal equilibrium statistical mechanics, despite their inherent
athermal features. Since then, the statistical mechanics approach for jammed
matter has garnered an extraordinary amount of attention by both theorists and
experimentalists. Here, we review a systematic approach to jammed matter based
on the Edwards statistical mechanical ensemble. We discuss the construction of
microcanonical and canonical ensembles based on the volume function, which
replaces the Hamiltonian in jammed systems. The importance of approximation
schemes at various levels is emphasized leading to quantitative predictions for
ensemble averaged quantities such as packing fractions and contact force
distributions. An overview of the phenomenology of jammed states and
experiments, simulations, and theoretical models scrutinizing the strong
assumptions underlying Edwards' approach is given including recent results
suggesting the validity of Edwards ergodic hypothesis for jammed states. A
theoretical framework for packings whose constitutive particles range from
spherical to non-spherical shapes like dimers, polymers, ellipsoids,
spherocylinders or tetrahedra, hard and soft, frictional, frictionless and
adhesive, monodisperse and polydisperse particles in any dimensions is
discussed providing insight into an unifying phase diagram for all jammed
matter. Furthermore, the connection between the Edwards' ensemble of metastable
jammed states and metastability in spin-glasses is established. This highlights
that the packing problem can be understood as a constraint satisfaction problem
for excluded volume and force and torque balance leading to a unifying
framework between the Edwards ensemble of equiprobable jammed states and

emergence of phenomena that have conventionally been studied in the realm of
quantum optics. These studies have not only deepened our understanding of
light-matter interactions but also introduced aspects of many-body correlations
inherent in optical processes in condensed matter systems. This article is
concerned with superradiance (SR), a profound quantum optical process predicted
by Dicke in 1954. The basic concept of SR applies to a general $N$-body system
where constituent oscillating dipoles couple together through interaction with
a common light field and accelerate the radiative decay of the system. In the
most fascinating manifestation of SR, known as superfluorescence (SF), an
incoherently prepared system of $N$ inverted atoms spontaneously develops
macroscopic coherence from vacuum fluctuations and produces a delayed pulse of
coherent light whose peak intensity $\propto N^2$. Such SF pulses have been
observed in atomic and molecular gases, and their intriguing quantum nature has
been unambiguously demonstrated. Here, we focus on the rapidly developing field
of research on SR in solids, where not only photon-mediated coupling but also
strong Coulomb interactions and ultrafast scattering exist. We describe SR and
SF in molecular centers in solids, molecular aggregates and crystals, quantum
dots, and quantum wells. In particular, we will summarize a series of studies
we have recently performed on quantum wells in strong magnetic fields. These
studies show that cooperative effects in solid-state systems are not merely
small corrections that require exotic conditions to be observed; rather, they
can dominate the nonequilibrium dynamics and light emission processes of the
entire system of interacting electrons.

comprising all possibly infinite structures generated by locally correct,

Curry-Howard paradigm of representation, from proofs to solutions: to represent
solutions by possibly infinite terms of a dedicated lambda-calculus. This new,
comprehensive approach to proof search is exemplified with the sequent calculus
LJT for intuitionistic implication logic. A finitary representation is
proposed, comprising lambda-terms extended with a formal greatest fixed point,
and a type system that can be seen as a logic of coinductive proofs. In the
finitary system, fixed-point variables enjoy a relaxed form of binding that
allows the detection of cycles through the type system. Formal sums are used to
express alternatives in the search process. Moreover, formal sums are used in
the coinductive syntax to define ""decontraction"" (contraction bottom-up) - an
operation whose theory we initiate in this paper. As a semantics, we assign a
coinductive lambda-term to each finitary term. The main result is the existence
of an equivalent finitary representation for any full solution space expressed
coinductively. This result is the main ingredient in the proof that our logic
of coinductive proofs is sound and complete with respect to the coinductive
semantics. These results are the foundation for an original approach to proof
search, where the search builds the finitary representation of the full
solution space, and the a posteriori analysis typically consisting in applying
a syntax-directed procedure or function. The paper illustrates this for proof
search and inhabitation problems in the simply-typed lambda-calculus, reviewing
results detailed elsewhere, and including new results that obtain extensive
generalizations of the so-called monatomic theorem.

methods have been proposed for detecting emerging events in text streams using
topic modeling. However, these methods have numerous shortcomings that make
them unsuitable for rapid detection of locally emerging events on massive text

specifically to overcome these shortcomings in detecting new spatially compact

  Semantic Scan integrates novel contrastive topic modeling with online
document assignment and principled likelihood ratio-based spatial scanning to
identify emerging events with unexpected patterns of keywords hidden in text
streams. This enables more timely and accurate detection and characterization
of anomalous, spatially localized emerging events. Semantic Scan does not
require manual intervention or labeled training data, and is robust to noise in
real-world text data since it identifies anomalous text patterns that occur in
a cluster of new documents rather than an anomaly in a single new document.
  We compare Semantic Scan to alternative state-of-the-art methods such as
Topics over Time, Online LDA, and Labeled LDA on two real-world tasks: (i) a
disease surveillance task monitoring free-text Emergency Department chief

what extent the emission rate can be increased. Here we develop a theoretical
framework to study single-photon emission from color centers in diamond under
electrical pumping. The proposed model comprises electron and hole trapping and
releasing, transitions between the ground and excited states of the color
center as well as structural transformations of the center due to carrier
trapping. It provides the possibility to predict both the photon emission rate
and the wavelength of emitted photons. Self-consistent numerical simulations of
the single-photon emitting diode based on the proposed model show that the
photon emission rate can be as high as 100 kcounts s$^{-1}$ at standard
conditions. In contrast to most optoelectronic devices, the emission rate
steadily increases with the device temperature achieving of more than 100
Mcount s$^{-1}$ at 500 K, which is highly advantageous for practical
applications. These results demonstrate the potential of color centers in
diamond as electrically driven non-classical light emitters and provide a

from bandwidth to other scarce resources including processing power and energy.
Especially, in device-to-device networks, where data rates are increasing

a deuteron projectile and dropped into a target play a crucial role in the
formation of nuclei in both primordial and stellar nucleosynthesis, as well as
in the study of exotic nuclei using radioactive beam facilities and inverse
kinematics. Ab initio approaches have been successfully applied to describe the
$^3$H$(d,n)^4$He and $^3$He$(d,p)^4$He fusion processes.
  Purpose: An ab initio treatment of transfer reactions would also be desirable
for heavier targets. In this work, we extend the ab initio description of
$(d,p)$ reactions to processes with light $p$-shell nuclei. As a first
application, we study the elastic scattering of deuterium on $^7$Li and the
${}^{7}$Li($d$,$p$)${}^{8}$Li transfer reaction based on a two-body
Hamiltonian.
  Methods: We use the no-core shell model to compute the wave functions of the
nuclei involved in the reaction, and describe the dynamics between targets and
projectiles with the help of microscopic-cluster states in the spirit of the
resonating group method.
  Results: The shape of the excitation functions for deuteron impinging on
${}^{7}$Li are qualitatively reproduced up to the deuteron breakup energy. The
interplay between $d$-$^7$Li and $p$-$^8$Li particle-decay channels determines
some features of the ${}^{9}$Be spectrum above the $d$+${}^{7}$Li threshold.
Our prediction for the parity of the 17.298 MeV resonance is at odds with the
experimental assignment
  Conclusions: Deuteron stripping reactions with $p$-shell targets can now be
computed ab initio, but calculations are very demanding. A quantitative
description of the ${}^{7}$Li($d$,$p$)${}^{8}$Li reaction will require further
work to include the effect of three-nucleon forces and additional decay
channels, and improve the convergence rate of our calculations.

the local antiferromagnetic exchange coupling can provide the pairing mechanism
of quasiparticles via the Kondo screening effect, leading to the heavy fermion
superconductivity. We find that the pairing symmetry \textit{strongly} depends
on the Fermi surface (FS) structure in the normal metallic state. When
$J_{H}/J_{K}$ is very small, the FS is a small hole-like circle around the
corner of the Brillouin zone, and the s-wave pairing symmetry has a lower
ground state energy. For the intermediate coupling values of $J_{H}/J_{K}$, the
extended s-wave pairing symmetry gives the favored ground state. However, when
$J_{H}/J_{K}$ is larger than a critical value, the FS transforms into four
small hole pockets crossing the boundary of the magnetic Brillouin zone, and
the d-wave pairing symmetry becomes more favorable. In that regime, the
resulting superconducting state is characterized by either nodal d-wave or
nodeless d-wave state, depending on the conduction electron filling factor as
well. A continuous phase transition exists between these two states. This
result may be related to the phase transition of the nodal d-wave state to a
fully gapped state, which is recently observed in Yb doped CeCoIn$_{5}$.

vary the escape fraction of ionizing photons, $f_{\rm esc}$, and the faint-end
slope of the AGN luminosity function at high redshifts, $\alpha_{\rm hz}$,
within the constraints from the observed cosmic star formation history and the
observed bright-end UV luminosity functions at $z \leq 6$. Additionally, we
model the spectral energy distribution (SED) of AGNs which depends on the
Eddington ratio and the black-hole mass. By comparing the computed reionization
histories with the observed \ion{H}{i} fractions and the optical depth for
Thomson scattering from Planck, we find that $\alpha_{\rm hz} > -1.5$ and
$f_{\rm esc} < 0.15$ are favored when we employ the bright-end luminosity
function obtained by Giallongo et al. Our result suggests that an AGN-dominated
model with the abundance of faint-AGNs being as large as the estimate by
Giallongo et al. is allowed only if the contribution from high-z galaxies is
almost negligible, while a galaxy-dominant model is also allowed. We also find
that the shape of SED has a significant impact on the thermal history.

system using the counter-rotating-hybridized rotating-wave (CHRW) method. This
CHRW method treats the driving field and the bias on equal footing by a unitary
transformation with two parameters $\xi$ and $\zeta$, and is nonperturbative in
driving strength, tunneling amplitude or bias. In addition, this CHRW method is
beyond the traditional rotating-wave approximation (Rabi-RWA) and yet by
properly choosing the two parameters $\xi$ and $\zeta$, the transformed
Hamiltonian takes the RWA form with a renormalized energy splitting and a
renormalized driving strength. The reformulated CHRW method possesses the same
mathematical simplicity as the Rabi-RWA approach and thus allows us to
calculate analytically the dynamics and explore explicitly the effect of the
bias. We show that the CHRW method gives the accurate driven dynamics for a
wide range of parameters as compared to the numerically exact results. When
energy scales of the driving are comparable to the intrinsic energy scale of
the two-level systems, the counter-rotating interactions and static bias
profoundly influence the generalized Rabi frequency. In this regime, where
ordinary perturbation approaches fail, the CHRW works very well and
efficiently. We also demonstrate the dynamics of the system in the
strong-driving and off-resonance cases for which the Rabi-RWA method breaks
down but the CHRW method remains valid. We obtain analytical expressions for
the generalized Rabi frequency and bias-modulated Bloch-Siegert shift as
functions of the bias, tunneling and driving field parameters. The CHRW
approach is a mathematically simple and physically clear method. It can be
applied to treat some complicated problems for which a numerical study is

focused on optimizing energy consumption and/or performance. Since embedded
systems typically have fewer cooling options, rising temperature, and thus
temperature optimization, is an emergent concern. Most embedded systems only
dissipate heat by passive convection, due to the absence of dedicated thermal
management hardware mechanisms. The embedded system`s temperature not only
affects the system`s reliability, but could also affect the performance, power,
and cost. Thus, embedded systems require efficient thermal management
techniques. However, thermal management can conflict with other optimization
objectives, such as execution time and energy consumption. In this paper, we
focus on managing the temperature using a synergy of cache optimization and
dynamic frequency scaling, while also optimizing the execution time and energy
consumption. This paper provides new insights on the impact of cache parameters
on efficient temperature-aware cache tuning heuristics. In addition, we present
temperature-aware phase-based tuning, TaPT, which determines Pareto optimal
clock frequency and cache configurations for fine-grained execution time,
energy, and temperature tradeoffs. TaPT enables autonomous system optimization
and also allows designers to specify temperature constraints and optimization
priorities. Experiments show that TaPT can effectively reduce execution time,
energy, and temperature, while imposing minimal hardware overhead.

embedded systems (nodes) to collaboratively execute applications spanning
diverse application domains (e.g., video, image processing, communication,

must operate under stringent constraints (e.g., energy, memory, etc.) and
should be specialized to meet varying application requirements in order to
adhere to these constraints. Phase-based tuning specializes system tunable
parameters to the varying runtime requirements of different execution phases to
meet optimization goals. Since the design space for tunable systems can be very
large, one of the major challenges in phase-based tuning is determining the
best configuration for each phase without incurring significant tuning overhead
(e.g., energy and/or performance) during design space exploration. In this
paper, we propose phase distance mapping, which directly determines the best
configuration for a phase, thereby eliminating design space exploration. Phase
distance mapping applies the correlation between the characteristics and best
configuration of a known phase to determine the best configuration of a new
phase. Experimental results verify that our phase distance mapping approach,
when applied to cache tuning, determines cache configurations within 1 % of the
optimal configurations on average and yields an energy delay product savings of
27 % on average.

on identifiability and search algorithms for directed acyclic graphical (DAG)

models that permit cycles occur. In this paper we address the issue of
identifiability for general directed cyclic graphical (DCG) models satisfying
the Markov assumption. In particular, in addition to the faithfulness
assumption which has already been introduced for cyclic models, we introduce
two new identifiability assumptions, one based on selecting the model with the
fewest edges and the other based on selecting the DCG model that entails the
maximum number of d-separation rules. We provide theoretical results comparing
these assumptions which show that: (1) selecting models with the largest number
of d-separation rules is strictly weaker than the faithfulness assumption; (2)
unlike for DAG models, selecting models with the fewest edges does not
necessarily result in a milder assumption than the faithfulness assumption. We
also provide connections between our two new principles and minimality
assumptions. We use our identifiability assumptions to develop search
algorithms for small-scale DCG models. Our simulation study supports our
theoretical results, showing that the algorithms based on our two new
principles generally out-perform algorithms based on the faithfulness

which in each round, each agent extracts information from few randomly chosen
agents. We seek to identify the smallest amount of information revealed in each
interaction (message size) that nevertheless allows for efficient and robust
computations of fundamental information dissemination tasks. We focus on the
Majority Bit Dissemination problem that considers a population of $n$ agents,
with a designated subset of source agents. Each source agent holds an input bit
and each agent holds an output bit. The goal is to let all agents converge
their output bits on the most frequent input bit of the sources (the majority
bit). Note that the particular case of a single source agent corresponds to the
classical problem of Broadcast. We concentrate on the severe fault-tolerant
context of self-stabilization, in which a correct configuration must be reached
eventually, despite all agents starting the execution with arbitrary initial
states.
  We first design a general compiler which can essentially transform any
self-stabilizing algorithm with a certain property that uses $\ell$-bits
messages to one that uses only $\log \ell$-bits messages, while paying only a
small penalty in the running time. By applying this compiler recursively we
then obtain a self-stabilizing Clock Synchronization protocol, in which agents
synchronize their clocks modulo some given integer $T$, within $\tilde O(\log
n\log T)$ rounds w.h.p., and using messages that contain $3$ bits only.
  We then employ the new Clock Synchronization tool to obtain a
self-stabilizing Majority Bit Dissemination protocol which converges in $\tilde
O(\log n)$ time, w.h.p., on every initial configuration, provided that the
ratio of sources supporting the minority opinion is bounded away from half.
Moreover, this protocol also uses only 3 bits per interaction.

algorithm makes $k$ rounds of parallel accesses to the data structure for a
given $k$. For any $k\ge 1$, we give a simple randomized algorithm solving the
approximate nearest neighbor search using $k$ rounds of parallel memory
accesses, with $O(k(\log d)^{1/k})$ accesses in total. We also give a more
sophisticated randomized algorithm using $O(k+(\frac{1}{k}\log d)^{O(1/k)})$
memory accesses in $k$ rounds for large enough $k$. Both algorithms use data
structures of size polynomial in $n$, the number of points in the database.

the present work, we study nonintegrable models of single and coupled quantum
relativistic kicked rotors (QRKRs) that bridge the gap between the conventional
quadratic rotors and the integrable linear models. For a single QRKR, we
supplement the recent analysis of the angular-momentum-space dynamics with a
study of the spin dynamics. Our analysis of two and three coupled QRKRs along
with the proved localization in the many-body linear model indicate that
dynamical localization exists in few-body systems. Moreover, the relation
between QRKR and linear rotor models implies that dynamical many-body
localization can exist in generic, nonintegrable many-body systems. And
localization can generally result from a complicated interplay between Anderson
mechanism and limiting integrability, since the many-body linear model is a
high-angular-momentum limit of many-body QRKRs. We also analyze the dynamics of
two coupled QRKRs in the highly unusual superballistic regime and find that the
resonance conditions are relaxed due to interactions. Finally, we propose
experimental realizations of the QRKR model in cold atoms in optical lattices.

{\lambda}, several systems are suggested to be counter-orbiting. While they may
be due to the projection effect, the mechanism to produce a counter-orbiting
planet is not established. A promising scenario for the counter-orbiting
planets is the extreme eccentricity evolution in near-coplanar hierarchical
triple systems with eccentric inner and outer or- bits. We examine this
scenario in detail by performing a series of systematic numerical simulations,
and consider the possibility of forming hot Jupiters, especially counter-
orbiting one under this mechanism with a distant sub-stellar perturber. We
incorporate quadrupole and octupole secular gravitational interaction between
the two orbits, and also short-range forces (correction for general relativity,
star and inner planetary tide and rotational distortion) simultaneously. We
find that most of systems are tidally disrupted and that a small fraction of
survived planets turns out to be prograde. The formation of counter-orbiting
hot Jupiters in this scenario is possible only in a very restricted parameter
region, and thus very unlikely in practice.

shared-classifier assumption made by previous methods and assume that the
source classifier and target classifier differ by a residual function. We
enable classifier adaptation by plugging several layers into deep network to
explicitly learn the residual function with reference to the target classifier.
We fuse features of multiple layers with tensor product and embed them into
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to match distributions for feature
adaptation. The adaptation can be achieved in most feed-forward models by
extending them with new residual layers and loss functions, which can be
trained efficiently via back-propagation. Empirical evidence shows that the new
approach outperforms state of the art methods on standard domain adaptation

are actually respectively a new chemically peculiar star and a new
spectroscopic binary containing a very slow rotator HD 42035 S with ultra-sharp
lines (vsini = 3.7 km/s) and a fast rotator HD 42035 B with broad lines. The
lines of Ti, Cr, Mn, Sr, Y, Zr and Ba are conspicuous features in the high
resolution SOPHIE spectrum of HD 67044. The HgII line at 3983.93 A is also
present as a weak feature. The composite spectrum of HD 42035 is characterised
by very sharp lines formed in HD 42035 S superimposed onto the shallow and
broad lines of HD 42035 B. These very sharp lines are mostly due to light
elements from C to Ni, the only heavy species definitely present are Sr and Ba.
Selected lines of 21 chemical elements from He up to Hg have been synthesized
using model atmospheres computed with ATLAS9 and the spectrum synthesis code
SYNSPEC48 including hyperfine structure of various isotopes when relevant.
Abundances of these key elements have been derived HD 67044 and HD 42035 S. HD
67044 is found to have distinct enhancements of Ti, Cr, Mn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba and
Hg and underabundances in He, C, O, Ca and Sc which shows that this star is not
a superficially normal late B-type star, but actually is a new CP star most
likely of the HgMn type. HD 42035 S has provisional underabundances of the
light elements from C to Ti and overabundances of heavier elements up to
barium. More accurate fundamental parameters and abundances for HD 42035 S and
HD 42035 B will be derived if we manage to disentangle their spectra. They will
help clarify the status of the two components in this interesting new

and computational capabilities compared to the RFDs which are cheap sensors
with a limited power supply. The scheme divides the network into smaller
sub-networks (regions) that are built from sectors and tracks. The objective of
this research is to balance and reduce the communication load on RFDs, reduce
the delay, and increase the connectivity and lifetime, by using a limited
number of FFDs. We investigate the performance of our scheme via numerical
simulation and compare it to other related schemes that are presented for
homogeneous WSNs with chain topology, such as Pegasis, Epegasis and Chiron. In
addition to extending the lifetime, our scheme also results in reducing the
data transmission delay compared to the related schemes. Furthermore, the
scheme increases the network security and reduces the RFDs power consumption by
preventing the direct communication with the base station (BS). The FFD is the
communication bridge between RFDs and BS. The FFD communicate with the BS using
the one-hop approach or multi-hop approach through other FFDs.

multiple timescales, variations on timescales greater than a day being
attributed to surface magnetic field. Independently, ground-based and
spaceborne measurements suggest that Sun-like stars show a similar, but
significantly broader pattern of photometric variability.
  To understand whether the broader pattern of stellar variations is consistent
with the solar paradigm we assess relative contributions of faculae and spots
to solar magnetically-driven brightness variability. We investigate how the
solar brightness variability as well as its facular and spot contributions
depend on the wavelength, timescale of variability, and position of the
observer relative to the ecliptic plane.
  We perform calculations with the SATIRE model, which returns solar brightness
with daily cadence from solar disc area coverages of various magnetic features.
  Moving the observer away from the ecliptic plane increases the amplitude of
11-year variability as it would be seen in Str\""omgren $(b+y)/2$ photometry,
but decreases the amplitude of the rotational brightness variations as it would
appear in Kepler and CoRoT passbands. The spot and facular contributions to the
11-year solar variability in the Str\""omgren $(b+y)/2$ photometry almost fully
compensate each other so that the Sun appears anomalously quiet with respect to
its stellar cohort. Such a compensation does not occur on the rotational
timescale.
  The rotational solar brightness variability as it would appear in Kepler and
CoRoT passband from the ecliptic plane is spot-dominated but the relative
contribution of faculae increases for out-of-ecliptic viewing so that the
apparent brightness variations are faculae-dominated for inclinations less than
about $i=45^{\circ}$.

  Parameter Tuning in Robotics",,,,,"cs.RO cs.LG cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Robotic algorithms typically depend on various parameters, the choice of
which significantly affects the robot's performance. While an initial guess for
the parameters may be obtained from dynamic models of the robot, parameters are
usually tuned manually on the real system to achieve the best performance.
Optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization, have been used to
automate this process. However, these methods may evaluate unsafe parameters
during the optimization process that lead to safety-critical system failures.
Recently, a safe Bayesian optimization algorithm, called SafeOpt, has been
developed, which guarantees that the performance of the system never falls
below a critical value; that is, safety is defined based on the performance
function. However, coupling performance and safety is often not desirable in
robotics. For example, high-gain controllers might achieve low average tracking
error (performance), but can overshoot and violate input constraints. In this
paper, we present a generalized algorithm that allows for multiple safety
constraints separate from the objective. Given an initial set of safe
parameters, the algorithm maximizes performance but only evaluates parameters
that satisfy safety for all constraints with high probability. To this end, it
carefully explores the parameter space by exploiting regularity assumptions in
terms of a Gaussian process prior. Moreover, we show how context variables can
be used to safely transfer knowledge to new situations and tasks. We provide a
theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enables fast,
automatic, and safe optimization of tuning parameters in experiments on a
quadrotor vehicle.

general relativity and in the linear massive gravity is analyzed without using
variational techniques. We start from a natural ansatz for the form of the
tensor (for example, that it is a linear combination of the terms quadratic in
the first derivatives), and require it to be conserved as a consequence of
field equations. In the case of the linear gravity in a general gauge we find a
four-parametric system of conserved second-rank tensors which contains a unique
symmetric tensor. This turns out to be the linearized Landau-Lifshitz
pseudotensor employed often in full general relativity. We elucidate the
relation of the four-parametric system to the expression proposed recently by
Butcher et al. ""on physical grounds"" in harmonic gauge, and we show that the
results coincide in the case of high-frequency waves in vacuum after a suitable
averaging. In the massive gravity we show how one can arrive at the expression
which coincides with the ""generalized linear symmetric Landau-Lifshitz"" tensor.
However, there exists another uniquely given simpler symmetric tensor which can
be obtained by adding the divergence of a suitable superpotential to the
canonical energy-momentum tensor following from the Fierz-Pauli action. In
contrast to the symmetric tensor derived by the Belinfante procedure which
involves the second derivatives of the field variables, this expression
contains only the field and its first derivatives. It is simpler than the
generalized Landau-Lifshitz tensor but both yield the same total quantities
since they differ by the divergence of a superpotential. We also discuss the
role of the gauge conditions in the proofs of the uniqueness. In the Appendix,
the use of the symbolic tensor manipulation software Cadabra is briefly
described.

investigated active light control of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in MoS2-Ag

red-shifted by increasing laser power, which was distinctly different from the
one of bare Ag nanostructure. This spectroscopic tunability can be further
controlled by near-field coupling strength and polarization state of light, and
selectively applied to the control of plasmonic dark mode. An analytical

Knowledge of the support volume is a prerequisite for the proper interpretation
and validation of hydrogeophysical data. In a previous study, several physical
simplifications have been introduced into a neutron transport model in order to
derive the characteristics of the cosmic-ray probe's footprint. We utilize a
refined source and energy spectrum for cosmic-ray neutrons and simulate their
response to a variety of environmental conditions. Results indicate that the
method is particularly sensitive to soil moisture in the first tens of meters
around the probe, whereas the radial weights are changing dynamically with
ambient water. The footprint radius ranges from 130 to 240 m depending on air
humidity, soil moisture and vegetation. The moisture-dependent penetration
depth of 15 to 83 cm decreases exponentially with distance to the sensor.
However, the footprint circle remains almost isotropic in complex terrain with

small molecule binds to subunit OSCP of the mitochondrial enzyme FoF1-ATP
synthase and modulates its catalytic activities. We investigate the binding of
Bz-423 to mitochondria in living cells and how subunit rotation in FoF1-ATP
synthase, i.e. the mechanochemical mechanism of this enzyme, is affected by
Bz-423. Therefore, the enzyme was marked selectively by genetic fusion with the
fluorescent protein EGFP to the C terminus of subunit gamma. Imaging the
threedimensional arrangement of mitochondria in living yeast cells was possible
at superresolution using structured illumination microscopy, SIM. We measured
uptake and binding of a Cy5-labeled Bz-423 derivative to mitochondrial FoF1-ATP
synthase in living yeast cells using FRET acceptor photobleaching microscopy.
Our data confirmed the binding of Cy5-labeled Bz-423 to the top of the F1
domain of the enzyme in mitochondria of living Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells.

  arXiv:1212.5225 by other authors",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we try to consider the stability conditions of a modified
gravity coupled by Weyl tensor. In this way, we indicate the suitable
conditions for a successful bounce while the equation of state (EoS) parameter
crosses the phantom divider for our new corrected modified gravity. In the
spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe,
according to the ordinary version of the holographic dark energy (HDE) model,
describing accelerated expansion of the universe, will be considered. Our
model's stability conditions and its general properties of attractors for
scalar field scripts which control cosmological acceleration will be checked.
The statefinder diagnostic parameters of our model will be compared by today's
observational data and defined methods. However its EoS parameter will be
obtained, too.

This can
be effectively accomplished using feedback control, where the system deviation
from the desired state is measured in order to determine the magnitude of the
restoring force to be applied. Contrary to conventional wisdom, i.e. that a
more precise measurement is expected to improve the system stability, here we
demonstrate that a certain degree of measurement error can improve the system
stability. We exemplify the implications of this finding with numerical
examples drawn from various fields, such as the operation of a temperature
controller, the confinement of a microscopic particle, the localization of a
target by a microswimmer, and the control of a population.
