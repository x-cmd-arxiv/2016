spectral unmixing approach for hyperspectral images. The robustness is achieved
by writing the unmixing problem as the maximization of the correntropy
criterion subject to the most commonly used constraints. Two unmixing problems
are derived: the first problem considers the fully-constrained unmixing, with
both the non-negativity and sum-to-one constraints, while the second one deals
with the non-negativity and the sparsity-promoting of the abundances. The
corresponding optimization problems are solved efficiently using an alternating

for different scenarios, demonstrating that the correntropy-based unmixing is
robust to outlier bands.

years due to environmental and economical concerns. Switching off
under-utilized BSs during off-peak traffic load conditions is a promising
approach to reduce energy consumption in cellular networks. In practice, during
initial cell planning, the BS locations and RAN parameters are optimized to
meet the basic system design requirements like coverage, capacity, overlap, QoS
etc. As these metrics are tightly coupled with each other due to co-channel
interference, switching off certain BSs may affect the system requirements.
Therefore, identifying a subset of large number of BSs which are to be put into
sleep mode, is a challenging dynamic optimization problem. In this work, we
develop a multiobjective framework for dynamic optimization framework for OFDMA
based cellular systems. The objective is to identify the appropriate set of
active sectors and RAN parameters that maximize coverage and area spectral
efficiency while minimizing overlap and area power consumption without
violating the QoS requirements for a given traffic demand density. The
objective functions and constraints are obtained using appropriate analytical
models which capture the traffic characteristics, propagation characteristics
(pathloss, shadowing, and small scale fading) as well as load condition in
neighbouring cells. A low complexity evolutionary algorithm is used for
identifying the global Pareto optimal solutions at a faster convergence rate.
The inter-relationships between the system objectives are studied and
guidelines are provided to find an appropriate network configuration that
provides the best achievable trade-offs. The results show that using the
proposed framework, significant amount of energy saving can be achieved and
with a low computational complexity while maintaining good trade-offs among the
other objectives.

called Goldilocks domains, and study their complex geometry. These domains are
defined in terms of a lower bound on how fast the Kobayashi metric grows and an
upper bound on how fast the Kobayashi distance grows as one approaches the
boundary. Strongly pseudoconvex domains and weakly pseudoconvex domains of
finite type always satisfy this Goldilocks condition, but we also present
families of Goldilocks domains that have low boundary regularity or have
boundary points of infinite type. We will show that the Kobayashi metric on
these domains behaves, in some sense, like a negatively curved Riemannian
metric. In particular, it satisfies a visibility condition in the sense of
Eberlein and O'Neill. This behavior allows us to prove a variety of results
concerning boundary extension of maps and to establish Wolff-Denjoy theorems
for a wide collection of domains.

Grant, Magnus Rattray","Inferring the perturbation time from biological time course data","63 pages, 20 figures, paper submitted to Bioinformatics",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Time course data are often used to study the changes to a biological process
after perturbation. Statistical methods have been developed to determine
whether such a perturbation induces changes over time, e.g. comparing a
perturbed and unperturbed time course dataset to uncover differences. However,
existing methods do not provide a principled statistical approach to identify
the specific time when the two time course datasets first begin to diverge
after a perturbation; we call this the perturbation time. Estimation of the
perturbation time for different variables in a biological process allows us to
identify the sequence of events following a perturbation and therefore provides
valuable insights into likely causal relationships.
  In this paper, we propose a Bayesian method to infer the perturbation time
given time course data from a wild-type and perturbed system. We use a
non-parametric approach based on Gaussian Process regression. We derive a
probabilistic model of noise-corrupted and replicated time course data coming
from the same profile before the perturbation time and diverging after the
perturbation time. The likelihood function can be worked out exactly for this
model and the posterior distribution of the perturbation time is obtained by a
simple histogram approach, without recourse to complex approximate inference
algorithms. We validate the method on simulated data and apply it to study the
transcriptional change occurring in Arabidopsis following inoculation with P.
syringae pv. tomato DC3000 versus the disarmed strain DC3000hrpA.
  An R package, DEtime, implementing the method is available at

outbursts and on to (iii) effective single-mode pulsators.
  The BRITE Constellation of nanosatellites was used to obtain mmag photometry
of the Be stars $\eta$ and \object{$\mu$ Cen}.
  In the low-inclination star \object{$\mu$ Cen}, light pollution by variable
amounts of near-stellar matter prevented any new insights into the variability
and other properties of the central star. In the equator-on star \object{$\eta$
Cen}, BRITE photometry and {\sc Heros} echelle spectroscopy from the 1990s
reveal an intricate clockwork of star-disk interactions. The mass transfer is
modulated with the frequency difference of two NRP modes and an amplitude three
times as large as the amplitude sum of the two NRP modes. This process feeds a
high-amplitude circumstellar activity running with the incoherent and slightly
lower so-called \v{S}tefl frequency. The mass loss-modulation cycles are
tightly coupled to variations in the value of the \v{S}tefl frequency and in
its amplitude, albeit with strongly drifting phase differences.
  The observations are well described by the decomposition of the mass loss
into a pulsation-related engine in the star and a viscosity-dominated engine in
the circumstellar disk. Arguments are developed that large-scale
gas-circulation flows occur at the interface. The propagation rates of these
eddies manifest themselves as \v{S}tefl frequencies. Bursts in power spectra
during mass-loss events can be understood as the noise inherent to these gas
flows.

minmax regret optimization problems. We show that the lower bound obtained is
always at least as accurate as the lower bound recently proposed by Chassein
and Goerigk (2015). This lower bound can be viewed as the optimal value of a
linear programming relaxation of a mixed integer programming formulation of
minmax regret optimization, but the contribution of the paper is to compute
this lower bound via a double oracle algorithm (McMahan et al., 2003) that we
specify. The double oracle algorithm is designed by relying on a game theoretic
view of robust optimization, similar to the one developed by Mastin et al.
(2015), and it can be efficiently implemented for any minmax regret
optimization problem whose standard version is ""easy"". We describe how to
efficiently embed this lower bound in a branch and bound procedure. Finally, we
apply our approach to the robust shortest path problem. Our numerical results
show a significant gain in the computation times compared to previous
approaches in the literature.

energy and dark matter, where the interaction in the dark sector is
parameterized as an energy transfer either from dark matter to dark energy or
the opposite. The models are constrained by a whole host of updated
cosmological data: cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies and
polarization, high-redshift supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift
space distortions and gravitational lensing. Both models are found to be
compatible with all cosmological observables, but in the case where dark matter
decays into dark energy, the tension with the independent determinations of
$H_0$ and $\sigma_8$, already present for standard cosmology, increases: this
model in fact predicts lower $H_0$ and higher $\sigma_8$, mostly as a
consequence of the higher amount of dark matter at early times, leading to a
stronger clustering during the evolution. Instead, when dark matter is fed by
dark energy, the reconstructed values of $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ nicely agree with
their local determinations, with a full reconciliation between high- and
low-redshift observations. A non-zero coupling between dark energy and dark
matter, with an energy flow from the former to the latter, appears therefore to
be in better agreement with cosmological data.

investigated the phonon transport properties of 2D orthorhombic group IV-VI
compounds of $GeS$, $GeSe$, $SnS$ and $SnSe$ by solving the Boltzmann transport
equation (BTE) based on first-principles calculations. Despite the similar
puckered (hinge-like) structure along the armchair direction as phosphorene,
the four monolayer compounds possess diverse anisotropic properties in many
aspects, such as phonon group velocity, Young's modulus and lattice thermal
conductivity ($\kappa$), etc. Especially, the $\kappa$ along the zigzag and
armchair directions of monolayer $GeS$ shows the strongest anisotropy while
monolayer $SnS$ and $SnSe$ shows an almost isotropy in phonon transport. The
origin of the diverse anisotropy is fully studied and the underlying mechanism
is discussed in detail. With limited size, the $\kappa$ could be effectively
lowered, and the anisotropy could be effectively modulated by nanostructuring,
which would extend the applications in nanoscale thermoelectrics and thermal
management. Our study offers fundamental understanding of the anisotropic
phonon transport properties of 2D materials, and would be of significance for
further study, modulation and aplications in emerging technologies.

the typical Centaur dynamical lifetime of a few Myrs and much shorter than the

world. Beyond encryption of data lies obfuscation, i.e., encryption of
functionality. It is well-known that the most powerful means of obfuscating
classical programs, so-called ``black-box obfuscation',' is provably impossible
[Barak et al '12]. However, several recent results have yielded candidate
schemes that satisfy a definition weaker than black-box, and yet still have
numerous applications.
  In this work, we initialize the rigorous study of obfuscating programs via
quantum-mechanical means. We define notions of quantum obfuscation which
encompass several natural variants. The input to the obfuscator can describe
classical or quantum functionality, and the output can be a circuit description
or a quantum state. The obfuscator can also satisfy one of a number of
obfuscation conditions: black-box, information-theoretic black-box,
indistinguishability, and best possible; the last two conditions come in three
variants: perfect, statistical, and computational. We discuss many
applications, including CPA-secure quantum encryption, quantum
fully-homomorphic encryption, and public-key quantum money.
  We then prove several impossibility results, extending a number of
foundational papers on classical obfuscation to the quantum setting. We prove
that quantum black-box obfuscation is impossible in a setting where adversaries
can possess more than one output of the obfuscator. In particular, generic
transformation of quantum circuits into black-box-obfuscated quantum circuits
is impossible. We also show that statistical indistinguishability obfuscation
is impossible, up to an unlikely complexity-theoretic collapse. Our proofs
involve a new tool: chosen-ciphertext-secure encryption of quantum data, which
was recently shown to be possible assuming quantum-secure one-way functions
exist [Alagic et al '16].

dynamical Riemannian geometry is presented. We treat 1D and 2D tissues as
continuous, deformable, growing geometries for sizes larger than 1mm. The
dynamics of the growing tissue are described by a set of coupled tensor
equations in non-Euclidean (curved) space. These coupled equations represent a
novel feedback mechanism between growth and curvature dynamics.
  For 1D growth, numerical simulations are compared to two measures of root
growth. First, modular growth along the simulated root shows an elongation zone
common to many species of plant roots. Second, the relative elemental growth
rate (REGR) calculated in silico exhibits temporal dynamics recently
characterized in high-resolution root growth studies but which thus far lack a
biological hypothesis to explain them. Namely, the REGR can evolve from a
single peak localized near the root tip to a double-peak structure. In our
model, this is a direct consequence of considering growth as both a geometric
reaction-diffusion process and expansion due to a distributed source of new
materials.
  In 2D, we study a circularly symmetric growing disk with emergent negative
curvatures. These results are compared against thin disk experiments, which are
a proxy model for plant leaves. These results also apply to the curvature
evolution and the inhomogeneous growth pattern of the Acetabularia cap. Lastly,
we extend the model to anisotropic disks and predict the growth dynamics for a
2D curved surface which develops an elongated shape with localized ruffling.
  Our model also provides several measures of the dynamics of tissue growth.
These include the time evolution of the metric and velocity field, which are
dynamical variables in the model, as well as expansion, shear and rotation
which are deformation tensors characterizing the growth of the tissue.

revisit its structure. The system is also interesting with respect to a new
type of geometrical frustration in elemental crystals, which was found in
beta-rhombohedral boron. Based on density functional theory calculations, the
present study has resolved the structural and thermodynamic characteristics of
pure alpha-tetragonal boron. Different from beta-rhombohedral boron, the
conditions for stable covalent bonding (a band gap and completely filled
valence bands) are almost fulfilled at a composition B_52 with two 4c
interstitial sites occupied. This indicates that the ground state of pure
alpha-tetragonal boron is stoichiometric. However, the covalent condition is
not perfectly fulfilled because non-bonding in-gap states exist that cannot be
eliminated. The half occupation of the 4c sites yields a macroscopic amount of
residual entropy, which is as large as that of beta-rhombohedral boron.
Therefore, alpha-tetragonal boron can be classified as an elemental crystal
with geometrical frustration. Deviations from stoichiometry can occur only at
finite temperatures. Thermodynamic considerations show that deviations delta
from the stoichiometric composition B_(52+delta) are small and positive. For
reported high-pressure syntheses conditions delta is predicted to be about 0.1
to 0.2. An important difference between pure and C- or N-containing
alpha-tetragonal boron is found in the occupation of interstitial sites: the
pure form prefers to occupy the 4c sites, whereas in C- or N-containing forms a
mixture of 2a, 8h, and 8i sites are occupied. The present article provides
relations of site occupation, delta values, and lattice parameters, which
enable us to identify pure alpha-tetragonal and distinguish the pure form from
other ones.

most sensitive aperture array ever used for radio astronomy, and will operate
in the under-sampled regime for most of the frequency band where grating-lobes
pose particular challenges. To achieve the expected level of sensitivity for
SKA-LOW, it is particularly important to understand how interfering sources in
both near and far side-lobes of the station beam affect the imaging
performance. We discuss options for station designs, and adopting a random
element layout, we assess its effectiveness by investigating how sources far
from the main lobe of the station beam degrade images of the target field.
These sources have the effect of introducing a noise-like corruption to images,
which we call the Far Side-lobe Source Noise (FSSN). Using OSKAR, a
GPU-accelerated software simulator, we carried out end-to-end simulations using
an all-sky model and telescope configuration representative of the SKA-LOW
instrument. The FSSN is a function of both the station beam and the
interferometric point spread function, and decreases with increasing
observation time until the coverage of the aperture plane no longer improves.
Using apodisation to reduce the level of near-in side-lobes of the station beam
had a noticeable improvement on the level of FSSN at low frequencies. Our
results indicate that the effects of picking up sources in the side-lobes are
worse at low frequencies, where the array is less sparse.

only the former type of agents, i.e., agents that tend to imitate the strategy

evolution of a population might be affected also by social behaviors as
conformism, stubbornness, altruism, and selfishness. Although the term
evolution can assume different meanings depending on the considered domain,
here it corresponds to the set of processes that lead a system towards an
equilibrium or a steady-state. We map fitness to the agents' payoff so that
richer agents are those most imitated by fitness-driven agents, while
conformity-driven agents tend to imitate the strategy assumed by the majority
of their neighbors. Numerical simulations aim to identify the nature of the
transition, on varying the amount of the relative density of conformity-driven
agents in the population, and to study the nature of related equilibria.
Remarkably, we find that conformism generally fosters ordered cooperative
phases and may also lead to bistable behaviors.

study the effects of the external electric field, charging, and loading

are different: some of them are locally oriented while others are globally
defined. Our investigations reveal that the mid-level deep representations

and constraining cosmological parameters using dynamical measurements. In the
standard method, galaxy line-of-sight (LOS) velocities, $v$, or velocity
dispersions are used to infer cluster masses, $M$, in order to quantify the
halo mass function (HMF), $dn(M)/d\log(M)$, which is strongly affected by mass
measurement errors. In our new method, the probability distribution of
velocities for each cluster in the sample are summed to create a new statistic
called the velocity distribution function (VDF), $dn(v)/dv$. The VDF can be
measured more directly and precisely than the HMF and it can also be robustly
predicted with cosmological simulations which capture the dynamics of subhalos
or galaxies. We apply these two methods to mock cluster catalogs and forecast
the bias and constraints on the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and the
amplitude of matter fluctuations $\sigma_8$ in flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies.
For an example observation of 200 massive clusters, the VDF with (without)
velocity errors constrains the parameter combination $\sigma_8\Omega_m^{0.29\
(0.29)} = 0.587 \pm 0.011\ (0.583 \pm 0.011)$ and shows only minor bias.
However, the HMF with dynamical mass errors is biased to low $\Omega_m$ and
high $\sigma_8$ and the fiducial model lies well outside of the forecast
constraints, prior to accounting for Eddington bias. When the VDF is combined
with constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the degeneracy
between cosmological parameters can be significantly reduced. Upcoming
spectroscopic surveys that probe larger volumes and fainter magnitudes will
provide a larger number of clusters for applying the VDF as a cosmological
probe.

fitting method using GALFIT. We then measure the total pixel area covered by a
galaxy above a given surface brightness threshold, which overcomes the
difficulty of measuring sizes of galaxies with irregular shapes. We then
compare the results obtained for the equivalent circularized radius enclosing
100\% of the measured galaxy light $r_T^{100}$ to those obtained with the
effective radius $r_{e,\mathrm{circ}}$ measured with GALFIT. We find that the
sizes of galaxies computed with our non-parametric approach span a large range
but remain roughly constant on average with a median value $r_T^{100}\sim2.2$
kpc for galaxies with $2<z<4.5$. This is in stark contrast with the strong
downward evolution of $r_e$ with increasing redshift, down to sizes of $<1$ kpc
at $z\sim4.5$. We analyze the difference and find that parametric fitting of
complex, asymmetric, multi-component galaxies is severely underestimating their
sizes. By comparing $r_T^{100}$ with physical parameters obtained through SED
fitting we find that the star-forming galaxies that are the largest at any
redshift are, on average, more massive and more star-forming. We discover that
galaxies present more concentrated light profiles as we move towards higher
redshifts. We interpret these results as the signature of several, possibly
different, evolutionary paths of galaxies in their early stages of assembly,
including major and minor merging or star-formation in multiple bright regions.

simultaneous fitting with the GOSSIP+ software of observed UV rest-frame
spectra and photometric data from the u-band up to 4.5 microns using composite
stellar population models. We conclude from extensive simulations that at z>2
the joint analysis of spectroscopy and photometry combined with restricted age
possibilities when taking into account the age of the Universe substantially
reduces systematic uncertainties and degeneracies in the age derivation. We
find galaxy ages ranging from very young with a few tens of million years to
substantially evolved with ages up to ~1.5-2 Gyr. The formation redshifts z_f
derived from the measured ages indicate that galaxies may have started forming
stars as early as z_f~15. We produce the formation redshift function (FzF), the
number of galaxies per unit volume formed at a redshift z_f, and compare the
FzF in increasing redshift bins finding a remarkably constant 'universal' FzF.
The FzF is parametrized with (1+z)^\zeta, with \zeta~0.58+/-0.06, indicating a
smooth 2 dex increase from z~15 to z~2. Remarkably this observed increase is of
the same order as the observed rise in the star formation rate density (SFRD).
The ratio of the SFRD with the FzF gives an average SFR per galaxy of
~7-17Msun/yr at z~4-6, in agreement with the measured SFR for galaxies at these
redshifts. From the smooth rise in the FzF we infer that the period of galaxy
formation extends from the highest possible redshifts that we can probe at z~15
down to redshifts z~2. This indicates that galaxy formation is a continuous
process over cosmic time, with a higher number of galaxies forming at the peak
in SFRD at z~2 than at earlier epochs. (Abridged)

more massive dark haloes than in the local Universe, a process known as
downsizing. By analysing the dark halo mass evolution using the extended

redshift, being 28.7\% at $< z > =$ 0.1, 15.1\% at $< z > =$ 0.65 and 3.5\% at
$< z > =$ 2. The fraction of mass in diffuse features linked with ongoing minor
merger events is $>$ 1-2\%, very similar to predictions based on observed close
pair counts. Therefore, the results for our small albeit meaningful sample

solely driven by minor and major merging from $z =$ 1 to today.

linearized Poincar\'e transformations from an observer's tangent space to

present an operational procedure by which observers can measure such quantities
using only information about the spacetime curvature at their location. When
applied by observers near spacelike or null infinity in stationary, vacuum,
asymptotically flat spacetimes, there is a sense in which the procedure yields
the well-defined linear and angular momenta of the spacetime.
  We also describe a general method by which observers can transport local
linear and angular momenta from one point to another, which improves previous
prescriptions. This transport is not path independent in general, but becomes
path independent for the measured momenta in the same limiting regime. The
transport prescription is defined in terms of differential equations, but it
can also be interpreted as parallel transport in a particular direct-sum vector
bundle. Using the curvature of the connection on this bundle, we compute and
discuss the holonomy of the transport law. We anticipate that these measurement
and transport definitions may ultimately prove useful for clarifying the
physical interpretation of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs charges of asymptotically

argue such an intermediate phase scenario may continue holding even for the
many-body localization in the presence of interactions as well. We find for
many-body states in non-interacting 1d Aubry-Andre and 3d Anderson models that
the entanglement entropy density and the normalized particle-number fluctuation
have discontinuous jumps at the localization transition where the entanglement
entropy is sub-thermal but obeys the ""volume law"". In the vicinity of the

astrophysical scenarios, which represent exciting laboratories to understand
physics in extreme regimes. We show that this system, when restricted to the
correct constraint submanifold, is symmetric hyperbolic. In numerical
applications is not feasible to keep the system in that submanifold, and so, it
is necessary to analyze its structure first in the tangent space of that
submanifold and then in a whole neighborhood of it. As already shown by
Pfeiffer, a direct (or naive) formulation of this system (in the whole tangent
space) results in a weakly hyperbolic system of evolution equations for which
well-possednes for the initial value formulation does not follows.
  Using the generalized symmetric hyperbolic formalism due to Geroch, we
introduce here a covariant hyperbolization for the FFE system. In fact, in
analogy to the usual Maxwell case, a complete family of hyperbolizers is found,
both for the restricted system on the constraint submanifold as well as for a
suitably extended system defined in a whole neighborhood of it. A particular
symmetrizer among the family is then used to write down the pertaining
evolution equations, in a generic ($3+1$)-decomposition on a background
spacetime. Interestingly, it turns out that for a particular choice of the

the one found by Pfeiffer. Finally we analyze the characteristic structure of

clustering properties of moderate luminosity AGN with those of powerful
UV/optically selected QSOs, which are typically found in halos with masses few
times $10^{12}\,M_{\odot}$. There is therefore evidence for a negative
luminosity dependence of the AGN clustering. This is consistent with
suggestions that AGN have a broad dark matter halo mass distribution with a
high mass tail that becomes sub-dominant at high accretion luminosities. We
further show that our results are in qualitative agreement with semi-analytic

16-qubit quantum circuits under environmental noise, each corresponding to a
unitary coupled cluster state preparation of a different molecule or molecular

noise-free circuits of up to 40 qubits. We find that the Jordan-Wigner (JW)
encoding produces consistently smaller errors under a noisy environment as
compared to the Bravyi-Kitaev (BK) encoding. For the JW encoding,
pure-dephasing noise is shown to produce substantially smaller errors than pure
relaxation noise of the same magnitude. We report error trends in both
molecular energy and electron particle number within a unitary coupled cluster
state preparation scheme, against changes in nuclear charge, bond length,
number of electrons, noise types, and noise magnitude. These trends may prove
to be useful in making algorithmic and hardware-related choices for quantum

stochastic flow of a reflected process in a convex polyhedral domain is
challenging because the dynamics are discontinuous at the boundary of the
domain and the boundary of the domain is not smooth. These difficulties can be
addressed by studying directional derivatives of an associated extended
Skorokhod map, which is a deterministic mapping that takes an unconstrained
path to a suitably reflected version. In this work we develop an axiomatic
framework for the analysis of directional derivatives of a large class of
Lipschitz continuous extended Skorokhod maps in convex polyhedral domains with
oblique directions of reflection. We establish existence of directional
derivatives at a path whose reflected version satisfies a certain boundary
jitter property, and also show that the right-continuous regularization of such
a directional derivative can be characterized as the unique solution to a
Skorokhod-type problem, where both the domain and directions of reflection vary
(discontinuously) with time. A key ingredient in the proof is establishing
certain contraction properties for a family of (oblique) derivative projection
operators. As an application, we establish pathwise differentiability of
reflected Brownian motion in the nonnegative quadrant with respect to the
initial condition, drift vector, dispersion matrix and directions of
reflection. The results of this paper are also used in subsequent work to
establish pathwise differentiability of a much larger class of reflected
diffusions in convex polyhedral domains.

The isomorphism depends on the Immirzi parameter, and reduces to the identity
when the parameter goes to infinity. Using this twistorial representation we
study the action of the conformal group SU(2,2) on the classical phase space of
loop quantum gravity, described by twisted geometry. The generators of
translations and conformal boosts do not preserve the geometric structure,
whereas the dilatation generator does. It corresponds to a 1-parameter family
of embeddings of T*SL(2,C) in twistor space, and its action preserves the
intrinsic geometry while changing the extrinsic one - that is the boosts among
polyhedra. We discuss the implication of this action from a dynamical point of
view, and compare it with a discretisation of the dilatation generator of the
continuum phase space, given by the Lie derivative of the group character. At
leading order in the continuum limit, the latter reproduces the same
transformation of the extrinsic geometry, while also rescaling the areas and
volumes and preserving the angles associated with the intrinsic geometry. Away
from the continuum limit its action has an interesting non-linear structure,
but is in general incompatible with the closure constraint needed for the
geometric interpretation. As a side result, we compute the precise relation
between the extrinsic geometry used in twisted geometries and the one defined

nowadays for computing neutral excitation energies and optical spectra of
crystalline systems from first principles. Bethe-Salpeter calculations yield
very good agreement with experiment but are notoriously difficult to converge
with respect to the sampling of the electronic wavevectors. Well-converged
spectra therefore require significant computational and memory resources, even
by today's standards. These bottlenecks hinder the investigation of systems of
great technological interest. They are also barriers to the study of derived
quantities like piezoreflectance, thermoreflectance or resonant Raman
intensities.
  We present a new methodology that decreases the workload needed to reach a
given accuracy. It is based on a double-grid on-the-fly interpolation within
the Brillouin zone, combined with the Lanczos algorithm. It achieves
significant speed-up and reduction of memory requirements. The technique is
benchmarked in terms of accuracy on silicon, gallium arsenide and lithium
fluoride. The scaling of the performance of the method as a function of the
Brillouin Zone point density is much better than a conventional implementation.
We also compare our method with other similar techniques proposed in the
literature.

perturbed profiles at different mode numbers. The linearized system gives rise
to singular shocks and through analyzing the perturbation profiles at various

linear cylindrical wave formation whereby highly oscillatory, bounded behaviour

  Towards More Predictable Databases",,,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Decades of research have sought to improve transaction processing performance
and scalability in database management systems (DBMSs). However, significantly
less attention has been dedicated to the predictability of performance: how
often individual transactions exhibit execution latency far from the mean?
Performance predictability is vital when transaction processing lies on the
critical path of a complex enterprise software or an interactive web service,
as well as in emerging database-as-a-service markets where customers contract
for guaranteed levels of performance. In this paper, we take several steps
towards achieving more predictable database systems. First, we propose a
profiling framework called VProfiler that, given the source code of a DBMS, is
able to identify the dominant sources of variance in transaction latency.
VProfiler automatically instruments the DBMS source code to deconstruct the
overall variance of transaction latencies into variances and covariances of the
execution time of individual functions, which in turn provide insight into the
root causes of variance. Second, we use VProfiler to analyze MySQL and Postgres
- two of the most popular and complex open-source database systems. Our case
studies reveal that the primary causes of variance in MySQL and Postgres are
lock scheduling and centralized logging, respectively. Finally, based on
VProfiler's findings, we further focus on remedying the performance variance of
MySQL by (1) proposing a new lock scheduling algorithm, called Variance-Aware
Transaction Scheduling (VATS), (2) enhancing the buffer pool replacement
policy, and (3) identifying tuning parameters that can reduce variance
significantly. Our experimental results show that our schemes reduce overall
transaction latency variance by 37% on average (and up to 64%) without
compromising throughput or mean latency.

  We recognize that this inverse problem is a special case of boundary
observability for a thermoelastic system. This leads to the use of
control/observability tools to prove the unique and stable recovery of the
initial acoustic profile in the weak thermoelastic coupling regime. This
approach is constructive, yielding a solvable equation for the unknown acoustic
profile. Moreover, the solution to this reconstruction equation can be
approximated numerically using the conjugate gradient method. If certain
geometrical conditions for the wave speed are satisfied, this approach is
well--suited for variable media and for measurements on a subset of the
boundary. We also present a numerical implementation of the proposed

are many interacting qubits, also fall into this group. Statistical
regularities come into play through inter-particle interactions, which have two
fundamental components: mean field, that along with external conditions, forms
the regular component of the dynamics, and residual interactions responsible
for the complex structure of the actual stationary states. At sufficiently high
level density, the stationary states become exceedingly complicated
superpositions of simple quasiparticle excitations. At this stage, regularities
typical of quantum chaos emerge and bring in signatures of thermalization. We
describe all the stages and the results of the processes leading to
thermalization, using analytical and massive numerical examples for realistic
atomic, nuclear, and spin systems, as well as for models with random
parameters. The structure of stationary states, strength functions of simple
configurations, and concepts of entropy and temperature in application to
isolated mesoscopic systems are discussed in detail. We conclude with a
schematic discussion of the time evolution of such systems to equilibrium.

show that the system's circumbinary ring, which acts as a screen that covers
and uncovers different portions of the binary orbit as the ring precesses, has
reached an orientation where the brighter component (star B) fully or nearly
fully emerges during each orbital cycle. The fainter component (star A) remains
fully occulted by the screen at all phases. The leading and trailing edges of
the screen move across the sky at the same rate of $\sim$15 meters per second,
consistent with expectation for a ring with a radius and width of $\sim$4 AU
and a precession period of $\sim$6500 years. Light and color variations
continue to indicate that the screen is sharp edged and opaque at \emph{VRIJH}

2.2, 3.6, and 4.5 $\mu$m. Reddening seen at the beginning of the eclipse that

extinction by a population of large dust grains. Meanwhile, the gradual bluing

phenomenon can be reproduced by two-dimensional Brownian dynamics simulations
of model particles [Dzubiella et al. Phys. Rev. E 65, 021402 (2002)]. Here we
use computer simulation to assess the generality of lane formation with respect
to variation of particle type and dynamical protocol. We find that laning
results from rectification of diffusion on the scale of a particle diameter:
oppositely-driven particles must, in the time taken to encounter each other in
the direction of the drive, diffuse in the perpendicular direction by about one
particle diameter. This geometric constraint implies that the diffusion
constant of a particle, in the presence of those of the opposite type, grows
approximately linearly with Peclet number, a prediction confirmed by our
numerics over a range of model parameters. Such environment-dependent diffusion
is statistically similar to an effective interparticle attraction; consistent
with this observation, we find that oppositely-driven non-attractive colloids
display features characteristic of the simplest model system possessing both
interparticle attractions and persistent motion, the driven Ising lattice gas
[Katz, Leibowitz, Spohn, J. Stat. Phys. 34, 497 (1984)]. These features include
long-ranged correlations in the disordered regime, and a critical regime
characterized by a change in slope of the particle current with Peclet number
and by fluctuations that grow with system size. By analogy, we suggest that
lane formation in the driven colloid system is in the macroscopic limit a phase
transition, but that macroscopic phase separation would not occur in finite
time upon starting from disordered initial conditions.

algorithms that provide feedback on the reasons for unrealizability, and
suggestions for making it realizable. Our algorithms are sound and complete,
i.e., they provide a correct diagnosis, and always terminate with a non-trivial
specification that is feasible using the chosen synthesis method, when such a
solution exists. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the
synthesis of controllers for various cyber-physical systems, including an
autonomous driving application and an aircraft electric power system.

this can be computationally expensive. In this regard, local spectral graph
clustering methods aim to identify well-connected clusters around a given ""seed

Approximate Personalized PageRank (APPR) algorithm in the seminal paper by
Andersen et al. is one such method. APPR was introduced and motivated purely
from an algorithmic perspective. In other words, there is no a priori notion of
objective function/optimality conditions that characterizes the steps taken by
APPR. Here, we derive a novel variational formulation which makes explicit the
actual optimization problem solved by APPR. In doing so, we draw connections
between the local spectral algorithm of and an iterative shrinkage-thresholding
algorithm (ISTA). In particular, we show that, appropriately initialized ISTA
applied to our variational formulation can recover the sought-after local
cluster in a time that only depends on the number of non-zeros of the optimal
solution instead of the entire graph. In the process, we show that an
optimization algorithm which apparently requires accessing the entire graph,
can be made to behave in a completely local manner by accessing only a small
number of nodes. This viewpoint builds a bridge across two seemingly disjoint
fields of graph processing and numerical optimization, and it allows one to
leverage well-studied, numerically robust, and efficient optimization
algorithms for processing today's large graphs.

efficacy of these stents has been shattered by ISR (In-Stent restenosis) and
late stent thrombosis. Research on finding a solution to these issues has led
to the development of DESs (Drug eluting stents). However long term
effectiveness of DESs and various drug delivery systems have raised concerns.
Also current DESs does not have the capability to adjust the drug dose or
release kinetics that corresponds to the diseased status of the affected
vessel. Through the use of a drug delivery system which employs controlled drug
release, it may be possible to control the release rate of the pharmacological
drugs or substances of interest, and therefore one might be able to circumvent

invasive interventions. To overcome the limitations of drug delivery systems,
the administration of drugs using nanoparticle based microcapsules as carriers
is being researched for their ability to facilitate a sustained, prolonged and

fix issues relating toxicity, chemical and mechanical properties of the
nanoparticles. This project combines a range of nanobiotechnological techniques

brain regions is a major goal of modern neuroscience and the BRAIN initiative.
Single-cell RNA sequencing can now be used to measure the gene expression
profiles of individual neurons and to categorize neurons based on their gene
expression profiles. While the single-cell techniques are extremely powerful
and hold great promise, they are currently still labor intensive, have a high
cost per cell, and, most importantly, do not provide information on spatial
distribution of cell types in specific regions of the brain. We propose a
complementary approach that uses computational methods to infer the cell types
and their gene expression profiles through analysis of brain-wide single-cell
resolution in situ hybridization (ISH) imagery contained in the Allen Brain
Atlas (ABA). We measure the spatial distribution of neurons labeled in the ISH
image for each gene and model it as a spatial point process mixture, whose
mixture weights are given by the cell types which express that gene. By fitting
a point process mixture model jointly to the ISH images, we infer both the
spatial point process distribution for each cell type and their gene expression
profile. We validate our predictions of cell type-specific gene expression
profiles using single cell RNA sequencing data, recently published for the
mouse somatosensory cortex. Jointly with the gene expression profiles, cell
features such as cell size, orientation, intensity and local density level are
inferred per cell type.

average metallicity was [Fe/H] = (-0.84 +/- 0.04) with dispersion rms = 0.31
dex and interquartile range 0.48. Our assignment of individual reddening values
makes our analysis more sensitive to spatial variations in metallicity than
previous studies. We divide our sample into metal-rich and metal-poor stars;
the former are found to cluster towards small radii with the metal-poor stars
more evenly distributed across the galaxy. The velocity dispersion of the
metal-poor stars is higher than that of the metal-rich stars; combined with the
age-metallicity relation this indicates that older populations have either been
dynamically heated or were born in a less disclike distribution. The low ratio

recently, estimators based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) and least
squares have appeared. Recent research suggests the least squares estimator to
be most accurate in many cases. The accuracy of all of these range estimators
depends upon the wavelengths chosen. This leads to the problem of selecting
wavelengths that maximise accuracy. Procedures for selecting wavelengths for
the beat wavelength and excess fractions methods have previously been
described, but procedures for the CRT and least squares estimators are yet to
be developed. In this paper we develop an algorithm to automatically select
wavelengths for use with the least square range estimator. The algorithm
minimises an optimisation criterion connected with the mean square error.
Interesting properties of a particular class of lattices simplify the criterion
allowing minimisation by depth first search. Monte-Carlo simulations indicate
that wavelengths that minimise the criterion can result is considerably more
accurate range estimates than wavelengths selected by ad hoc means.

  Clustering","9 pages. 2 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Clustering is one of the most fundamental and important tasks in data mining.
Traditional clustering algorithms, such as K-means, assign every data point to
exactly one cluster. However, in real-world datasets, the clusters may overlap
with each other. Furthermore, often, there are outliers that should not belong
to any cluster. We recently proposed the NEO-K-Means (Non-Exhaustive,
Overlapping K-Means) objective as a way to address both issues in an integrated
fashion. Optimizing this discrete objective is NP-hard, and even though there
is a convex relaxation of the objective, straightforward convex optimization
approaches are too expensive for large datasets. A practical alternative is to
use a low-rank factorization of the solution matrix in the convex formulation.
The resulting optimization problem is non-convex, and we can locally optimize
the objective function using an augmented Lagrangian method. In this paper, we
consider two fast multiplier methods to accelerate the convergence of an
augmented Lagrangian scheme: a proximal method of multipliers and an
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). For the proximal augmented
Lagrangian or proximal method of multipliers, we show a convergence result for
the non-convex case with bound-constrained subproblems. These methods are up to
13 times faster---with no change in quality---compared with a standard
augmented Lagrangian method on problems with over 10,000 variables and bring
runtimes down from over an hour to around 5 minutes.

propose new coding strategies involving both unstructured and structured coding

the $l$-descriptions problem was the Combinatorial Message Sharing with Binning

unstructured binning. In the first part of the paper, we show that this
strategy can be improved upon using more general unstructured quantizers and a
more general unstructured binning method. In the second part, structured coding
strategies are considered. First, structured coding strategies are developed by
considering specific MD examples involving three or more descriptions. We show
that application of structured quantizers results in strict RD improvements
when there are more than two descriptions. Furthermore, we show that structured
binning also yields improvements. These improvements are in addition to the
ones derived in the first part of the paper. This suggests that structured
coding is essential when coding over more than two descriptions. Using the
ideas developed through these examples we provide a new unified coding strategy
by considering several structured coding layers. Finally, we characterize its
performance in the form of an inner bound to the optimal rate-distortion region
using computable single-letter information quantities. The new RD region
strictly contains all of the previous known achievable regions.

X-ray and optical data of the Population II red dwarf -- Kapteyn's Star.
Kapteyn's Star is noteworthy for its large proper motions and high RV of ~+245
km s^-1. As the nearest Pop II red dwarf, it serves as an old age anchor for
calibrating Activity/Irradiance-Rotation-Age relations, and an important test
bed for stellar dynamos and the resulting X-ray -- UV emissions of slowly
rotating, near-fully convective red dwarf stars. Adding to the notoriety,
Kapteyn's Star has recently been reported to host two super-Earth candidates,
one of which (Kapteyn b) is orbiting within the habitable zone (Anglada-Escude
et al. 2014a, 2015). However, Robertson et al. (2015) questioned the planet's
existence since its orbital period may be an artifact of activity, related to
the star's rotation period. Because of its large Doppler-shift, measures of the
important, chromospheric H I Lyman-alpha 1215.67A emission line can be reliably
made, because it is mostly displaced from ISM and geo-coronal sources.
Lyman-alpha emission dominates the FUV region of cool stars. Our measures can
help determine the X-ray--UV effects on planets hosted by Kapteyn's Star, and
planets hosted by other old red dwarfs. Stellar X-ray and Lyman-alpha emissions
have strong influences on the heating and ionization of upper planetary
atmospheres and can (with stellar winds and flares) erode or even eliminate
planetary atmospheres. Using our program stars, we have reconstructed the past
exposures of Kapteyn's Star's planets to coronal -- chromospheric XUV emissions

intermediate vector representation (such as polygons). Consequently, the
resultant bezigons are sometimes imperfect due to accumulated errors, fitting
ambiguities, and a lack of curve priors, especially for low-resolution images.
In this paper, we describe a novel method for vectorizing clipart images. In
contrast to previous methods, we directly optimize the bezigons rather than
using other intermediate representations; therefore, the resultant bezigons are
not only of higher fidelity compared with the original raster image but also
more reasonable because they were traced by a proficient expert. To enable such
optimization, we have overcome several challenges and have devised a
differentiable data energy as well as several curve-based prior terms. To
improve the efficiency of the optimization, we also take advantage of the local
control property of bezigons and adopt an overlapped piecewise optimization
strategy. The experimental results show that our method outperforms both the
current state-of-the-art method and commonly used commercial software in terms
of bezigon quality.

nanophotonics. However, considerable plasmon loss narrows the application
regime of plasmonic devices. Here we reveal some general conditions for
lossless surface polaritons to emerge at the interface of a gain and a loss
media. The gain medium does not only compensate the energy loss, but also
modifies surface wave oscillation mechanisms. A new type of surface polaritons
induced by the sign switch of the imaginary part of the permittivity across the
interface is discovered. The surface polaritons exhibit spin Hall effect due to
spin-momentum locking and unique Berry phase. The spin Hall coefficient changes
the sign across the parity-time symmetric limit and becomes quantized for
perfect metal-dielectric interface and for dielectric-dielectric interface with
very large permittivity contrast, carrying opposite topological numbers. Our
study opens a new direction for manipulating light with surface polaritons in

Niblack binarization algorithm is adopted. The endpoints of these lines are
determined and a connection is created among them using the Delaunay
triangulation thereby generating a distinct topological structure of each
palmprint. Next, we extract different geometric as well as quantitative
features from the triangles of the Delaunay triangulation that assist in
identifying different individuals. To ensure that the proposed approach is
invariant to rotation and scaling, features were made relative to topological
and geometrical structure of the palmprint. The similarity of the two
palmprints is computed using the weighted sum approach and compared with the
k-nearest neighbor. The experimental results obtained reflect the effectiveness
of the proposed approach to discriminate between different palmprint images and
thus achieved a recognition rate of 90% over large databases.

used strategies to allocate divisible resources for strategic users in
communication networks and computing systems. The users are deemed as selfish
and also benign, each of which maximizes his individual utility of the
allocated resources minus his payment to the network operator. However, in many
applications a user can use his payment to reduce the utilities of his
opponents, thus playing a misbehaving role. It remains mysterious to what
extent the misbehaving user can damage or influence the performance of benign
users and the network operator. In this work, we formulate a non-cooperative
game consisting of a finite amount of benign users and one misbehaving user.
The maliciousness of this misbehaving user is captured by his willingness to
pay to trade for unit degradation in the utilities of benign users. The network
operator allocates resources to all the users via the price-anticipating Kelly
mechanism. We present six important performance metrics with regard to the
total utility and the total net utility of benign users, and the revenue of
network operator under three different scenarios: with and without the
misbehaving user, and the maximum. We quantify the robustness of PAKM against
the misbehaving actions by deriving the upper and lower bounds of these
metrics. With new approaches, all the theoretical bounds are applicable to an
arbitrary population of benign users. Our study reveals two important insights:
i) the performance bounds are very sensitive to the misbehaving user's
willingness to pay at certain ranges; ii) the network operator acquires more
revenues in the presence of the misbehaving user which might disincentivize his
countermeasures against the misbehaving actions.

effective spin-temperature established among the electron spins of radicals, as
expected from the quantum theory of thermalization. Moreover, we present an
analytical technique to estimate the spin temperature, and thus, the nuclear
hyperpolarization in the steady state, as a function of interaction strength

results. Our central finding is that the nuclear hyperpolarization increases
steadily upon reducing the interaction strength (by diluting the radical
density). Interestingly, the highest polarization is reached at a point where
the establishment of a spin temperature is just about to break down due to the
incipient many-body localization transition in the electron spin system.

One blends an incremental subgradient method, which is a useful algorithm for

algorithm. The other is based on an incremental subgradient method and the
Krasnosel'ski\u\i-Mann fixed point algorithm. It is shown that any weak

XX Cep from high-resolution time-series spectroscopic data. The effective
temperature of the primary star was determined to be 7,946 $\pm$ 240 K by
comparing the observed spectra and the Kurucz models. We detected the
absorption lines of the secondary star, which had never been detected in
previous studies, and obtained the radial velocities for both components. With
the published $BVRI$ light curves, we determined the absolute parameters for
the binary via Wilson-Devinney modeling. The masses and radii are $M_{1} = 2.49

observational constraints such as the redshift evolution of the BH mass density
and the mass function. Strong self-regulation via AGN feedback, weak supernova
feedback, and unresolved internal processes result in a tight BH-galaxy mass
correlation. Starting at z~2, tidal stripping creates a small population of BHs
over-massive with respect to the halo. The fraction of galaxies hosting a
central BH or an AGN increases with stellar mass. The AGN fraction agrees
better with multi-wavelength studies, than single-wavelength ones, unless
obscuration is taken into account. The most massive halos present BH
multiplicity, with additional BHs gained by ongoing or past mergers. In some
cases, both a central and an off-centre AGN shine concurrently, producing a
dual AGN. This dual AGN population dwindles with decreasing redshift, as found
in observations. Specific accretion rate and Eddington ratio distributions are
in good agreement with observational estimates. The BH population is dominated
in turn by fast, slow, and very slow accretors, with transitions occurring at

problem of finding a matching that admits the minimum number of blocking pairs

However, it has also been widely reported that these techniques would create a

hence would limit the scalability of the system. To eliminate this problem, we

accordingly to minimize the garbage collection overhead. In particular, we
present Deca, a concrete implementation of our proposal on top of Spark, which
transparently decomposes and groups objects with similar lifetimes into byte

provided in situ measurements of the dust grain properties from several
instruments, particularly OSIRIS and GIADA. We propose adding value to those
measurements by combining them with ground-based observations of the dust tail
to monitor the overall, time-dependent dust-production rate and size
distribution. To constrain the dust grain properties, we take Rosetta OSIRIS
and GIADA results into account, and combine OSIRIS data during the approach
phase (from late April to early June 2014) with a large data set of
ground-based images that were acquired with the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT)
from February to November 2014. A Monte Carlo dust tail code has been applied
to retrieve the dust parameters. Key properties of the grains (density,
velocity, and size distribution) were obtained from Rosetta observations: these
parameters were used as input of the code to considerably reduce the number of
free parameters. In this way, the overall dust mass-loss rate and its
dependence on the heliocentric distance could be obtained accurately. The dust
parameters derived from the inner coma measurements by OSIRIS and GIADA and
from distant imaging using VLT data are consistent, except for the power index
of the size-distribution function, which is $\alpha$=--3, instead of
$\alpha$=--2, for grains smaller than 1 mm. This is possibly linked to the
presence of fluffy aggregates in the coma. The onset of cometary activity
occurs at approximately 4.3 au, with a dust production rate of 0.5 kg/s,
increasing up to 15 kg/s at 2.9 au. This implies a dust-to-gas mass ratio
varying between 3.8 and 6.5 for the best-fit model when combined with
water-production rates from the MIRO experiment.

outcome of galaxy evolution via successive mergers. However, the mechanism that
drives their orbital evolution from parsec separations down to the
gravitational wave (GW) dominated regime is poorly understood, and their final
fate is still unclear. If such binaries are embedded in gas-rich and turbulent
environments, as observed in remnants of galaxy mergers, the interaction with
gas clumps (such as molecular clouds) may efficiently drive their orbital
evolution. Using numerical simulations, we test this hypothesis by studying the
dynamical evolution of an equal-mass, circular MBHB accreting infalling
molecular clouds. We investigate different orbital configurations, modelling a
total of 13 systems to explore different possible impact parameters and
relative inclinations of the cloud-binary encounter. We focus our study on the
prompt, transient phase during the first few orbits when the dynamical
evolution of the binary is fastest, finding that this evolution is dominated by
the exchange of angular momentum through gas capture by the individual black
holes and accretion. Building on these results, we construct a simple model for
evolving a MBHB interacting with a sequence of clouds, which are randomly drawn
from reasonable populations with different levels of anisotropy in their
angular momenta distributions. We show that the binary efficiently evolves down
to the GW emission regime within a few hundred million years, overcoming the
'final parsec' problem regardless of the stellar distribution.

Atlas is currently perturbed by both a 54:53 corotation eccentricity resonance
(CER) and a 54:53 Lindblad eccentricity resonance (LER) with Prometheus. They
demonstrated that the orbit of Atlas is chaotic, with a Lyapunov time of order
10 years, as a direct consequence of the coupled resonant interaction (CER/LER)
with Prometheus. Here we investigate the interactions between the two
resonances using the CoraLin analytical model (El Moutamid et al. 2014),
showing that the chaotic zone fills almost all the corotation sites occupied by
the satellite's orbit. Four 70:67 apse-type mean motion resonances with Pandora
are also overlapping, but these resonances have a much weaker effect. Frequency
analysis allows us to highlight the coupling between the 54:53 resonances, and
confirms that a simplified system including the perturbations due to Prometheus

enhancement of pulsation amplitude in conjunction with bursts, and smooth

collapse. In general however, these two objectives are distinct and must be
separately enforced. We formulate an optimization problem which maximizes the

games, when the population from which all individuals are drawn is structured -
i.e. when a given individual is only competing with a small subset of the
entire population.
  Method: To optimize the focus on multiplayer effects, a class of games were
chosen for which the payoff depends nonlinearly on the number of cooperators -
this ensures that the game cannot be represented as a sum of pair-wise
interactions, and increases the likelihood of observing behaviour different
from that seen in two-player games. The chosen class of games are named
""threshold games"", and are defined by a threshold, $M > 0$, which describes the
minimal number of cooperators in a given match required for all the
participants to receive a benefit. The model was studied primarily through
numerical simulations of large populations of individuals, each with
interaction neighbourhoods described by various classes of networks.
  Results: When comparing the level of cooperation in a structured population
to the mean-field model, we find that most types of structure lead to a
decrease in cooperation. This is both interesting and novel, simply due to the
generality and breadth of relevance of the model - it is likely that any model
with similar payoff structure exhibits related behaviour.
  More importantly, we find that the details of the behaviour depends to a
large extent on the size of the immediate neighbourhoods of the individuals, as
dictated by the network structure. In effect, the players behave as if they are
part of a much smaller, fully mixed, population, which we suggest an expression
for.

Keplerian motion. Using the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) with the

quasar HE 0435-4312 (z = 1.2231) over a period of three years (Dec 23/24, 2012
to Dec 7/8, 2015). Both the Mg II line and the Fe II pseudo-continuum increase
with time. We clearly detect the systematic shift of the Mg II line with
respect to the Fe II over the years, corresponding to the acceleration of 104
pm 14 km/s/year in the quasar rest frame. The Mg II line shape is clearly
non-Gaussian but single-component, and the increase in line equivalent width
and line shift is not accompanied with significant evolution of the line shape.
We analyse the conditions in the Mg II and Fe II formation region and we note
that the very large difference in the covering factor and the turbulent
velocity also support the conclusion that the two regions are spatially
separated. The measured acceleration of the line systematic shift is too large
to connect it with the orbital motion at a distance of the Broad Line Region

BLR. Further monitoring is still needed to better constrain the variability

identify the transmit covariance matrices to be used by each relay in the
multiple-access (MAC) state of the MDF-MAC protocol. As done for the
single-antenna 2-relay Gaussian diamond channel, the channel parameter $\Delta$
is defined to be the difference between the product of the capacities of the
links from the source to the two relays and the product of the capacities of
the links from the two relays to the destination.

reconnection occurs in partially ionized plasma, like the solar chromosphere,
is still poorly understood. It has been shown that for sufficiently high
magnetic Reynolds numbers, Sweet-Parker current sheets can become unstable
leading to tearing mode instability and plasmoid formation, but when dealing
with a partially ionized plasma the strength of coupling between the ions and
neutrals plays a fundamental role in determining the dynamics of the system. We
propose that as the reconnecting current sheet thins and the tearing
instability develops, plasmoid formation passes through strongly,
intermediately, and weakly coupled (or decoupled) regimes, with the time scale
for the tearing mode instability depending on the frictional coupling between
ions and neutrals. We present calculations for the relevant time scales for
fractal tearing in all three regimes. We show that as a result of the tearing
mode instability and the subsequent non-linear instability due to the
plasmoid-dominated reconnection, the Sweet-Parker current sheet tends to have a
fractal-like structure, and when the chromospheric magnetic field is
sufficiently strong the tearing instability can reach down to kinetic scales,
which are hypothesized to be necessary for fast reconnection.

which we have called quasi-integrability, is related to special properties of
the two-soliton solutions under space-time parity transformations. Some
properties of the AT solitons are discussed, especially those involving
interesting static multi-soliton solutions. We support our analytical studies
with detailed numerical ones in which the time evolution has been simulated by
the 4th order Runge-Kutta method. We find that for some perturbations the
solitons repel and for the others they form a quasi-bound state. When we send
solitons towards each other they can repel when they come close together with
or without `flipping' the fields of the model. The solitons radiate very little
and appear to be stable. These results support the ideas of
quasi-integrability, {\it i.e.} that many effects of integrability also
approximately hold for the deformed models.

development of two software applications. Additionally, we compared EventB2Java
against two other tools for Event-B code generation. EventB2Java enables users
to start the software development process in Event-B, where users can model the

to substitute networks of classical neurons in applied tasks. This work
explores recent hardware designs focusing on perspective applications (like

side to analyse whether there is a possibility for spiking neuromorphic
hardware to grow up for a wider use. Our comparison shows that spiking hardware
is at least on the same level of energy efficiency or even higher than
non-spiking on a level of basic operations. However, on a system level, spiking
systems are outmatched and consume much more energy due to inefficient data
representation with a long series of spikes. If spike-driven applications,
minimizing an amount of spikes, are developed, spiking neural systems may reach
the energy efficiency level of classical neural systems. However, in the near
future, both type of neuromorphic systems may benefit from emerging memory
technologies, minimizing the energy consumption of computation and memory for
both neuron types. That would make infrastructure and data transfer energy
dominant on the system level. We expect that spiking neurons have some
benefits, which would allow achieving better energy results. Still the problem
of an amount of spikes will still be the major bottleneck for spiking hardware
systems.

collaboration has launched a quest for the identification of their
astrophysical sources. Gamma-ray blazars have been predicted to yield a
cumulative neutrino signal exceeding the atmospheric background above energies
of 100 TeV, assuming that both the neutrinos and the gamma-ray photons are
produced by accelerated protons in relativistic jets. Since the background
spectrum falls steeply with increasing energy, the individual events with the
clearest signature of being of an extraterrestrial origin are those at PeV
energies. Inside the large positional-uncertainty fields of the first two PeV
neutrinos detected by IceCube, the integrated emission of the blazar population
has a sufficiently high electromagnetic flux to explain the detected IceCube
events, but fluences of individual objects are too low to make an unambiguous
source association. Here, we report that a major outburst of the blazar PKS
B1424-418 occurred in temporal and positional coincidence with the third
PeV-energy neutrino event (IC35) detected by IceCube. Based on an analysis of
the full sample of gamma-ray blazars in the IC35 field and assuming a
photo-hadronic emission model, we show that the long-term average gamma-ray
emission of blazars as a class is in agreement with both the measured all-sky
flux of PeV neutrinos and the spectral slope of the IceCube signal. The
outburst of PKS B1424-418 has provided an energy output high enough to explain
the observed PeV event, indicative of a direct physical association.

of the method is in its infancy. Furthermore, much of the existing analysis
deals with the large ensemble limit, far from the regime in which the method is

inverse problems with fixed ensemble size. A continuous-time limit is derived
and the long-time behavior of the resulting dynamical system is studied. Most
of the rigorous analysis is confined to the linear forward problem, where we
demonstrate that the continuous time limit of the EnKF corresponds to a set of
gradient flows for the data misfit in each ensemble member, coupled through a
common pre-conditioner which is the empirical covariance matrix of the

creates an implicit representation of the deformable mesh using a dense

for the images. The fine scale deformation of all mesh vertices that maximizes
photo-consistency can be efficiently found by densely optimizing a new

Unconventional mechanisms to explain this discrepancy have been argued so far,

provide a new theoretical prediction, by which the discrepancy itself is
resolved without any complicated unconventional explanation. Phonon dispersions
and changes of nesting vectors in Fermi surfaces are clarified to lead to the
variety of superlattice structures even for the common crystal structures when
without CDW, including orthorhombic $2 \times 2 \times 1$ one for
BaTi$_2$As$_2$O, which has not yet been explained successfully so far, being
different from tetragonal $\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2} \times 1$ for

naturally explain experimental observations about CDW including most latest

coupled physics"" technique, in which the image contrast is due to optical
absorption, but the information is carried to the surface of the tissue as
ultrasound pulses. Many algorithms and formulae for PAT image reconstruction
have been proposed for the case when a complete data set is available. In many
practical imaging scenarios, however, it is not possible to obtain the full
data, or the data may be sub-sampled for faster data acquisition. In such
cases, image reconstruction algorithms that can incorporate prior knowledge to
ameliorate the loss of data are required. Hence, recently there has been an
increased interest in using variational image reconstruction. A crucial
ingredient for the application of these techniques is the adjoint of the PAT
forward operator, which is described in this article from physical, theoretical
and numerical perspectives. First, a simple mathematical derivation of the
adjoint of the PAT forward operator in the continuous framework is presented.
Then, an efficient numerical implementation of the adjoint using a k-space time
domain wave propagation model is described and illustrated in the context of
variational PAT image reconstruction, on both 2D and 3D examples including
inhomogeneous sound speed. The principal advantage of this analytical adjoint
over an algebraic adjoint (obtained by taking the direct adjoint of the
particular numerical forward scheme used) is that it can be implemented using
currently available fast wave propagation solvers.

this study is to develop an intelligent algorithm to be embedded into the
transceivers so that all users know how to self-tune their medium access
probability (MAP) to achieve overall Pareto optimality in terms of network
throughput under spatial reuse while maintaining network stability. While the
optimal solution requires each user to have complete information about the
network, our proposed algorithm only requires users to have local information.
The fundamental of our algorithm is that the users will first self-organize
into a number of non-overlapping neighborhoods, and the user with the maximum
node degree in each neighborhood is elected as the local leader (LL). Each LL
then adjusts its MAP according to a parameter R which indicates the radio
intensity level in its neighboring region, whereas the remaining users in the
neighborhood simply follow the same MAP value. We show that by ensuring R less
than or equal to 2 at the LLs, the stability of the entire network can be
assured even when each user only has partial network information. For practical
implementation, we propose each LL to use R=2 as the constant reference signal
to its built-in proportional and integral controller. The settings of the
control parameters are discussed and we validate through simulations that the
proposed method is able to achieve close-to-Pareto-front throughput.

needs focal plane wavefront correction to recover high contrast. The most
efficient correction methods iteratively estimate the stellar electric field
and suppress it with active optics. The estimation requires several images from
the science camera per iteration. To maximize the science yield, it is
desirable both to have fast wavefront correction and to utilize all the
correction images for science target detection. Exoplanets and disks are
incoherent with their stars, so a nonlinear estimator is required to estimate
both the incoherent intensity and the stellar electric field. Such techniques
assume a high level of stability found only on space-based observatories and
possibly ground-based telescopes with extreme adaptive optics. In this paper,
we implement a nonlinear estimator, the iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF),
to enable fast wavefront correction and a recursive, nearly-optimal estimate of
the incoherent light. In Princeton's High Contrast Imaging Laboratory we
demonstrate that the IEKF allows wavefront correction at least as fast as with
a Kalman filter and provides the most accurate detection of a faint companion.
The nonlinear IEKF formalism allows us to pursue other strategies such as
parameter estimation to improve wavefront correction.

in the last few years, raised serious concerns regarding user privacy and Web
usability. As a reaction to these concerns, we have witnessed the emergence of
a myriad of ad-blocking and anti-tracking tools, whose aim is to return control
to users over advertising. The problem with these technologies, however, is
that they are extremely limited and radical in their approach: users can only
choose either to block or allow all ads. With around 200 million people
regularly using these tools, the economic model of the Web ---in which users
get content free in return for allowing advertisers to show them ads--- is at
serious peril. In this paper, we propose a smart Web technology that aims at
bringing transparency to online advertising, so that users can make an informed
and equitable decision regarding ad blocking. The proposed technology is
implemented as a Web-browser extension and enables users to exert fine-grained
control over advertising, thus providing them with certain guarantees in terms
of privacy and browsing experience, while preserving the Internet economic
model. Experimental results in a real environment demonstrate the suitability
and feasibility of our approach, and provide preliminary findings on behavioral

arbitrary recovery rate on the SIR spreading dynamics on complex networks. We
derive the theoretical effective epidemic threshold and final outbreak size

theoretical predictions, extensive numerical experiments are implemented by
using asynchronous and synchronous updating methods. When asynchronous updating
method is used in simulations, recovery rate does not affect the final state of
spreading dynamics. But with synchronous updating, we find that the effective
epidemic threshold decreases with recovery rate, and final outbreak size
increases with recovery rate. A good agreement between the theoretical

highly accurate first principles quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques to obtain
structural and magnetic properties of the iron selenide (FeSe) superconductor
under pressure. Where comparable, the computed properties are very close to the
experimental values. Of potential ordered magnetic configurations, collinear
spin configurations are the most energetically favorable over the explored
pressure range. They become nearly degenerate in energy with bicollinear spin
orderings at around 7 GPa, when the experimental critical temperature $T_c$ is
the highest. On the other hand, ferromagnetic, checkerboard, and staggered
dimer configurations become relatively higher in energy as the pressure
increases. The behavior under pressure is explained by an accurate analysis of
the charge compressibility and the orbital occupation as described by the QMC
many-body wave function, which reveals how spin, charge and orbital degrees of
freedom are strongly coupled in this compound. This remarkable pressure
evolution suggests that stripe-like magnetic fluctuations may be responsible
for the enhanced $T_c$ in FeSe and that higher T$_c$ is associated with
nearness to a crossover between collinear and bicollinear ordering.

alternative treatments reported in the literature. Here we report on such an
example from a drug development for wet age-related macular degeneration. This
disease is the leading cause of severe vision loss in the elderly. While
current treatment options are efficacious, they are also a substantial burden
for the patient. Hence, new treatments are under development which need to be

leads to is meta-analysis, which addresses the question of how we can combine
datasets collected under different conditions. Bayesian methods have long been
used to achieve partial pooling. Here we consider the challenge when the model

raw data while the second dataset is given as averages only. In such a
situation, common meta-analytic methods can only be applied when the model is
sufficiently simple for analytic approaches. When the model is too complex, for
example nonlinear, an analytic approach is not possible. We provide a Bayesian

condensed matter problems. A powerful test-bed for the many-body concepts and
methods is the Kondo model which entails the coupling of a quantum impurity to
a continuum of states. It is central in highly correlated systems and can be
explored with tunable nanostructures. Although Kondo physics is usually
associated with the hybridization of itinerant electrons with microscopic
magnetic moments, theory predicts that it can arise whenever degenerate quantum
states are coupled to a continuum. Here we demonstrate the previously elusive
`charge' Kondo effect in a hybrid metal-semiconductor implementation of a
single-electron transistor, with a quantum pseudospin-1/2 constituted by two
degenerate macroscopic charge states of a metallic island. In contrast to other
Kondo nanostructures, each conduction channel connecting the island to an
electrode constitutes a distinct and fully tunable Kondo channel, thereby
providing an unprecedented access to the two-channel Kondo effect and a clear
path to multi-channel Kondo physics. Using a weakly coupled probe, we reveal
the renormalization flow, as temperature is reduced, of two Kondo channels
competing to screen the charge pseudospin. This provides a direct view of how
the predicted quantum phase transition develops across the symmetric quantum
critical point. Detuning the pseudospin away from degeneracy, we demonstrate,
on a fully characterized device, quantitative agreement with the predictions
for the finite-temperature crossover from quantum criticality.

information theory and signal processing communities. As a consequence, a
plethora of sparsity metrics has been presented in the literature. The
appropriateness of these metrics is typically evaluated against a set of
objective criteria that has been proposed for assessing the credibility of any
sparsity metric. In this paper, we propose a Generalised Differential Sparsity
(GDS) framework for generating novel sparsity metrics whose functionality is
based on the concept that sparsity is encoded in the differences among the
signal coefficients. We rigorously prove that every metric generated using GDS
satisfies all the aforementioned criteria and we provide a computationally
efficient formula that makes GDS suitable for high-dimensional signals. The
great advantage of GDS is its flexibility to offer sparsity metrics that can be
well-tailored to certain requirements stemming from the nature of the data and
the problem to be solved. This is in contrast to current state-of-the-art
sparsity metrics like Gini Index (GI), which is actually proven to be only a
specific instance of GDS, demonstrating the generalisation power of our
framework. In verifying our claims, we have incorporated GDS in a stochastic
signal recovery algorithm and experimentally investigated its efficacy in
reconstructing randomly projected sparse signals. As a result, it is proven
that GDS, in comparison to GI, both loosens the bounds of the assumed sparsity
of the original signals and reduces the minimum number of projected dimensions,
required to guarantee an almost perfect reconstruction of heavily compressed
signals. The superiority of GDS over GI in conjunction with the fact that the
latter is considered as a standard in numerous scientific domains, prove the
great potential of GDS as a general purpose framework for measuring sparsity.

of the interaction of 0.511 MeV gamma quanta in plastic scintillators is much
lower. As the major point of the article, a method allowing to record
timestamps of several photons, at two ends of the scintillator strip, by means
of matrix of silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) is introduced. As a result of
simulations, conducted with the number of SiPM varying from 4 to 42, it is
shown that the improvement of timing resolution saturates with the growing
number of photomultipliers, and that the 2 x 5 configuration at two ends
allowing to read twenty timestamps, constitutes an optimal solution. The
conducted simulations accounted for the emission time distribution, photon
transport and absorption inside the scintillator, as well as quantum efficiency
and transit time spread of photosensors, and were checked based on the
experimental results. Application of the 2 x 5 matrix of SiPM allows for
achieving the coincidence resolving time in positron emission tomography of

team selects one of its players simultaneously in each round and each player
can play at most once. The competition defines an extensive-form game with
perfect recall and can be solved efficiently by standard methods. We are
interested in the properties of the subgame perfect equilibria of this game.
  We first show that uniformly random strategy is a subgame perfect equilibrium
strategy for both teams when there are no redundant players (i.e., the number
of players in each team equals to the number of rounds of the competition).
Secondly, a team can safely abandon its weak players if it has redundant
players and the strength of players is transitive.
  We then focus on the more interesting case where there are redundant players
and the strength of players is not transitive. In this case, we obtain several
counterintuitive results. First of all, a player might help improve the payoff
of its team, even if it is dominated by the entire other team. We give a
necessary condition for a dominated player to be useful. We also study the
extent to which the dominated players can increase the payoff.
  These results bring insights into playing and designing general team
competitions.

have different and time varying beliefs that, as time progresses, converge to a
common belief. A global utility function that depends on the realized state of
the environment and actions of all the agents determines the system's optimal
behavior. We define the asymptotically optimal action profile as an equilibrium
of the potential game defined by considering the expected utility with respect
to the asymptotic belief. At finite time, however, agents have not entirely
congruous beliefs about the state of the environment and may select conflicting
actions. This paper proposes a variation of the fictitious play algorithm which
is proven to converge to equilibrium actions if the state beliefs converge to a
common distribution at a rate that is at least linear. In conventional
fictitious play, agents build beliefs on others' future behavior by computing
histograms of past actions and best respond to their expected payoffs
integrated with respect to these histograms. In the variations developed here
histograms are built using knowledge of actions taken by nearby nodes and best
responses are further integrated with respect to the local beliefs on the state
of the environment. We exemplify the use of the algorithm in coordination and

localization-delocalization transition in the presence of a quasi-periodic
potential as a function of that potential. In the presence of interactions,
this transition transforms into a Many-Body Localization (MBL) transition.
Recent studies have suggested that this type of transition can also occur in
models with quasi-periodic potentials that possess single particle mobility
edges. Two such models were studied in PRL 115,230401(2015) but only one was
found to exhibit an MBL transition in the presence of interactions while the
other one did not. In this work we investigate the occurrence of MBL in the
presence of weak interactions in five different models with single particle
mobility edges in one dimension with a view to obtaining a criterion for the
same. We find that not all such models undergo a thermal-MBL phase transition
in presence of weak interactions. We propose a criterion to determine whether
MBL is likely to occur in presence of interaction based only on the properties
of the non-interacting models. The relevant quantity $\epsilon$ is a measure of
how localized the localized states are relative to how delocalized the
delocalized states are in the non-interacting model. We also study various
other features of the non-interacting models such as the divergence of the
localization length at the mobility edge and the presence or absence of
`ergodicity' and localization in their many-body eigenstates. However, we find
that these features cannot be used to predict the occurrence of MBL upon the
introduction of weak interactions.

dimension D of the most dissipative structures, D=3-Delta/(1-beta). While this
description has proved most successful for incompressible turbulence
(beta=Delta=2/3, and D=1), its applicability in the highly compressible regime
remains debated. For this regime, theoretical arguments suggest D=2 and
Delta=2/3, or Delta=1. Best estimates based on 3D periodic box simulations of
supersonic isothermal turbulence yield Delta=0.71 and D=1.9, with uncertainty
ranges of Delta in [0.67, 0.78] and D in [2.04,1.60]. With these 5-10\%
uncertainty ranges just marginally including the theoretical values of
Delta=2/3 and D=2, doubts remain whether the model indeed applies and, if it
applies, for what values of beta and Delta. We use a Monte Carlo approach to
mimic actual simulation data and examine what factors are most relevant for the
fit quality. We estimate that 0.1% (0.05%) accurate Z_p, with p=1...5, should
allow for 2% (1%) accurate estimates of beta and Delta in the highly
compressible regime, but not in the mildly compressible regime. We argue that
simulation-based Z_p with such accuracy are within reach of today's computer
resources. If this kind of data does not allow for the expected high quality
fit of beta and Delta, then this may indicate the inapplicability of the model
for the simulation data. In fact, other models than the one we examine here

assume that the opinion of a given agent is only affected by the opinions of
those agents that she considers trustworthy (i.e., the agents in the trust
network that are directly linked to her). Each agent is endowed with a goal,
expressed in a suitable temporal language inspired from linear temporal logic
(LTL). We show that games of influence provide a simple abstraction to explore
the effects of the trust network structure on the agents' behaviour, by
considering solution concepts from game-theory such as Nash equilibrium, weak
dominance and winning strategies.

  Chaitin's Omega",,,,,"math.LO cs.CC cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chaitin's number Omega is the halting probability of a universal prefix-free
machine, and although it depends on the underlying enumeration of prefix-free
machines, it is always Turing-complete. It can be observed, in fact, that for
every computably enumerable (c.e.) real, there exists a Turing functional via
which Omega computes it, and such that the number of bits of omega that are
needed for the computation of the first n bits of the given number (i.e. the
use on argument n) is bounded above by a computable function h(n) = n+o(n). We
characterise the asymptotic upper bounds on the use of Chaitin's omega in
oracle computations of halting probabilities (i.e. c.e. reals). We show that
the following two conditions are equivalent for any computable function h such
that h(n)-n is non-decreasing: (1) h(n)-n is an information content measure,
(2) for every c.e. real there exists a Turing functional via which omega
computes the real with use bounded by h. We also give a similar
characterisation with respect to computations of c.e. sets from Omega, by
showing that the following are equivalent for any computable non-decreasing
function g: (1) g is an information-content measure, (2) for every c.e. set A,
Omega computes A with use bounded by g. Further results and some connections
with Solovay functions are given.

matter and dark energy, and are found to be quite common in physical theories.
These fields are susceptible to gravitational forces so that being massless is
not enough to remain conformal invariant. They should also be connected
directly to the scalar curvature. Because of this characteristics, we
investigated the structure and interactions of scalar fields under the
conformal transformations. We show how to reduce the quadratic quantum
contributions in the single scalar field theory. In the multi-scalar field
theories, we analyzed interactions in certain limits. We suggest a new method

reveal some important properties of a hypergraph via its adjacency tensor,
Laplacian tensor, and signless Laplacian tensor. Owing to the sparsity of these
tensors, we propose an efficient approach to calculate products of these
tensors and any vectors. Using the state-of-the-art L-BFGS approach, we develop
a first-order optimization algorithm for computing H- and Z-eigenvalues of
these large scale sparse tensors (CEST). With the aid of the
Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property, we prove that the sequence of iterates
generated by CEST converges to an eigenvector of the tensor.When CEST is
started from multiple randomly initial points, the resulting best eigenvalue
could touch the extreme eigenvalue with a high probability. Finally, numerical
experiments on small hypergraphs show that CEST is efficient and promising.
Moreover, CEST is capable of computing eigenvalues of tensors corresponding to
a hypergraph with millions of vertices.

the presence of an externally unbounded acoustic medium. In this vibration,
damping associated with the radiation of energy from the confined solid medium
to the surrounding acoustic medium is observed. Evaluating the coupled system
response (solid displacement and acoustic pressure) and characterizing the
acoustic radiation damping in conjunction with the media properties are the
main objectives of this research. In this work, acoustic damping is
demonstrated for two problems: the thin spherical shell and the solid sphere.
The mathematical approach followed in solving these coupled problems is based
on the Laplace transform method. The linear under-damped harmonic oscillator is
the reference model for damping estimation. The damping evaluation is performed
in frequency as well as in time domains; both investigations lead to identical
damping factor expressions.

consensus-based non-Bayesian learning. In particular, we consider the scenario
where the networked agents may suffer crash faults, and messages delay can be
arbitrarily long but finite. We identify the minimal global detectability of
the network for non-Bayesian rule to succeed. In addition, we obtain a
generalization of a celebrated result by Wolfowitz and Hajnal to submatrices,
which might be of independent interest.

deposition) and the stratigraphic record using a simple numerical model of
delta-plain evolution, with the aim of constraining these connections and thus
improving prediction of subsurface features. The model represents channel
dynamics using a simple but flexible cellular approach, and is unique in that
it explicitly includes backwater effects that are known to be important in
low-gradient channel networks. The patterns of channel deposits in the
stratigraphic record vary spatially due to variation in avulsion statistics
with radial distance from the delta's source of water and sediment. We
introduce channel residence time as an important statistical measure of the
surface channel kinematics. The model suggests that the mean channel residence
time anywhere within the delta is nicely described by a power law distribution
showing a cutoff that depends on radial distance. Thicknesses of channel
deposits are not uniquely determined by the residence time of channelization.
The channel residence time distributions at given radial distances from the
source are found to be approximately lognormally distributed, a finding
consistent with the scale-dependent radial structure of channel deposits in the
stratigraphic record.
