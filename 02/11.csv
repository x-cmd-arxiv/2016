very-high-energy (VHE, $E>100$GeV) $\gamma$-ray emission and hosts an extended

implies an inverse Compton origin. These observations are unusual for LBLs
calling for a consistent explanation of this extraordinary source. The
observationally constrained parameters necessary to describe the core emission
within the standard one-zone model are unable to explain the broad-band
spectrum, even if observationally unconstrained external photon fields are
taken into account. We demonstrate that the addition of the extended jet
emission successfully reproduces the total spectral energy distribution. In
particular, the VHE radiation is produced in the $>100\,$kpc long extended jet
via inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons by highly
relativistic electrons. We present several ways to test this theory. The
extended jet is weakly magnetized ($B_0 = 2.5\,\mu$G), while its minimum and
maximum electron Lorentz factors are $\gamma_{min}=60$ and
$\gamma_{max}=5\times 10^6$, respectively. The electron spectral index is

population requires accurate information on connections between population
members. However, such connectivity data, when collected via interview, is
often incomplete due to partial recall, respondent fatigue or study design,
e.g., fixed choice designs (FCD) truncate out-degree by limiting the number of
contacts each respondent can report. Past research has shown how FCD truncation
affects network properties, but its implications for predicted speed and size
of spreading processes remain largely unexplored. To study the impact of degree
truncation on spreading processes, we generated collections of synthetic
networks containing specific properties (degree distribution,
degree-assortativity, clustering), and also used empirical social network data
from 75 villages in Karnataka, India. We simulated FCD using various truncation
thresholds and ran a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) process on each
network. We found that spreading processes propagated on truncated networks
resulted in slower and smaller epidemics, with a sudden decrease in prediction
accuracy at a level of truncation that varied by network type. Our results have
implications beyond FCD to truncation due to any limited sampling from a larger
network. We conclude that knowledge of network structure is important for
understanding the accuracy of predictions of process spread on degree truncated
networks.

$x_0$ is contained in a certain convex subset $K \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, we
prove that accurate recovery is already feasible if the number of observations
exceeds the effective dimension of $K$, which is a common measure for the
complexity of signal classes. It will turn out that the possibly unknown
non-linearity of our model affects the error rate only by a multiplicative
constant. This achievement is based on recent works by Plan and Vershynin, who
have suggested to treat the non-linearity rather as noise which perturbs a
linear measurement process. Using the concept of restricted strong convexity,
we show that their results for the generalized Lasso can be extended to a
fairly large class of convex loss functions. Moreover, we shall allow for the
presence of adversarial noise so that even deterministic model inaccuracies can
be coped with. These generalizations particularly give further evidence of why
many standard estimators perform surprisingly well in practice, although they
do not rely on any knowledge of the underlying output rule. To this end, our
results provide a unified and general framework for signal reconstruction in
high dimensions, covering various challenges from the fields of compressed
sensing, signal processing, and statistical learning.

electrons, and for ions at $\sim$0.1 and $\sim$2 MeV energies, as measured by
the Solar Electron and Proton Telescope (SEPT) instruments aboard the twin
Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft. Methods. We employ
an online STEREO in situ shock catalog that lists all shocks observed between
2007 and mid 2014 (observed by STEREO A) and until end of 2013 (observed by
STEREO B). In total 475 shocks are listed. To determine the particle
acceleration efficiency of these shocks, we analyze the associated intensity
increases (shock spikes) during the shock crossings. For the near-relativistic
electrons, we take into account the issue of possible ion contamination in the
SEPT instrument. Results. The highest acceleration efficiency is found for low
energy ions (0.1 MeV), which show a shock-associated increase at 27% of all
shocks. The 2 MeV ions show an associated increase only during 5% of the shock
crossings. In the case of the electrons, the shocks are nearly ineffective.
Only five shock-associated electron increases were found, which correspond to
only 1% of all shock crossings.

$\lambda = \sqrt{2} (M_R -M)$. In this article, we argue that the Siegert's

a sample geometry to study the influence of spin degrees of freedom on
topological insulator properties. $n$ quintuple layers (QLs) of Bi$_2$Se$_3$
are grown ontop of Mn-doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$ by molecular beam epitaxy for $0\le n
\le 30\,$QLs, allowing to unhamperedly monitor the development of electronic
and topological properties by surface sensitive techniques like angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy. With increasing $n$, a Mn-induced gap at the Dirac
point is gradually filled in an ""hourglass"" fashion to reestablish a
topological surface state at $n \sim 9\,$QLs. Our results suggest a competition
of upwards and downwards band bending effects due to the presence of an n-p
type interface, which can be used to tailor topological and quantum well states
independently.

photospheric line width, as measured by the rotational parameter $v \sin i$, to
vary in correlation with the emission activity. Here we present new
observations, covering the most recent activity phase, and further archival
data collected from the archives. The $v \sin i$ variation is confirmed. On the
basis of the available data it cannot be decided with certainty whether the
increased line width precedes the emission activity, i.e. is a signature of the
ejection mechanism, or postdates is, which would make it a signature of
re-accretion of some of the disk-material. However, the observed evidence leans
towards the re-accretion hypothesis. Two further stars showing the effect of
variable line width in correlation with emission activity, namely 66 Oph and

the Be/X-ray binary pulsar KS 1947+300 during its 2013 giant outburst. We used
data from Suzaku observations of the pulsar at two epochs i.e. on 2013 October
22 (close to the peak of the outburst) and 2013 November 22. X-ray pulsations
at $\sim$18.81 s were clearly detected in the light curves obtained from both
observations. Pulse periods estimated during the outburst showed that the
pulsar was spinning up. The pulse profile was found to be single-peaked up to
$\sim$10 keV beyond which a sharp peak followed by a dip-like feature appeared
at hard X-rays. The dip-like feature has been observed up to $\sim$70 keV. The
1-110 keV broad-band spectroscopy of both observations revealed that the
best-fit model comprised of a partially absorbed Negative and Positive power
law with EXponential cutoff (NPEX) continuum model along with a blackbody
component for the soft X-ray excess and two Gaussian functions at 6.4 and 6.7
keV for emission lines. Both the lines were identified as emission from neutral
and He-like iron atom. To fit the spectra, we included the previously reported
cyclotron absorption line at 12.2 keV. From the spin-up rate, the magnetic
field of the pulsar was estimated to be $\sim$1.2$\times$10$^{12}$ G and found
to be comparable to that obtained from the detection of the cyclotron
absorption feature. Pulse-phase resolved spectroscopy revealed the pulsating
nature of the soft X-ray excess component in phase with the continuum flux.
This confirms that the accretion column and/or accretion stream are the most
probable regions of pulsar's soft X-ray excess emission. The presence of the
pulsating soft X-ray excess in phase with continuum emission may be the
possible reason for not observing the dip at soft X-rays.

reasons. This paper proposes a fully automatic framework to reconstruct retinal
images of high spatial resolution and increased FOV from multiple
low-resolution images captured with non-mydriatic, mobile and video-capable but
low-cost cameras. Within the scope of one examination, we scan different
regions on the retina by exploiting eye motion conducted by a patient guidance.
Appropriate views for our mosaicing method are selected based on optic disk
tracking to trace eye movements. For each view, one super-resolved image is
reconstructed by fusion of multiple video frames. Finally, all super-resolved
views are registered to a common reference using a novel polynomial
registration scheme and combined by means of image mosaicing. We evaluated our
framework for a mobile and low-cost video fundus camera. In our experiments, we
reconstructed retinal images of up to 30{\deg} FOV from 10 complementary views
of 15{\deg} FOV. An evaluation of the mosaics by human experts as well as a
quantitative comparison to conventional color fundus images encourage the

in a smoother geometry. During that relaxation phase, a characteristic damped
ringing is generated. It can be theoretically constructed from both the black
hole quasinormal frequencies (which govern its oscillating behavior and its
decay) and the associated excitation factors (which determine intrinsically its
amplitude) by carefully taking into account the source of the distortion. In
the framework of massive gravity, the excitation factors of the Schwarzschild
black hole have an unexpected strong resonant behavior which, theoretically,
could lead to giant and slowly decaying ringings. If massive gravity is
relevant to physics, one can hope to observe these extraordinary ringings by
using the next generations of gravitational wave detectors. Indeed, they could
be generated by supermassive black holes if the graviton mass is not too small.
In fact, by focusing on the odd-parity $\ell=1$ mode of the Fierz-Pauli field,
we shall show here that such ringings are neutralized in waveforms due to (i)
the excitation of the quasibound states of the black hole and (ii) the
evanescent nature of the particular partial modes which could excite the
concerned quasinormal modes. Despite this, with observational consequences in
mind, it is interesting to note that the waveform amplitude is nevertheless
rather pronounced and slowly decaying (this effect is now due to the long-lived
quasibound states). It is worth noting also that, for very low values of the
graviton mass (corresponding to the weak instability regime for the black
hole), the waveform is now very clean and dominated by an ordinary ringing
which could be used as a signature of massive gravity.

The chemistry of the diffuse interstellar medium rests upon three
pillars: exothermic ion-neutral reactions ("" cold chemistry ""), endothermic
neutral-neutral reactions with significant activation barriers ("" warm
chemistry ""), and reactions on the surfaces of dust grains. While warm
chemistry becomes important in the shocks associated with turbulent dissipation
regions, the main path for the formation of interstellar OH and H2O is that of
cold chemistry. Aims. The aim of this study is to observationally confirm the
association of atomic oxygen with both atomic and molecular gas phases, and to
understand the measured abundances of OH and OH + as a function of the
available reservoir of H2. Methods. We obtained absorption spectra of the
ground states of OH, OH+ and OI with high-velocity resolution, with GREAT
on-board SOFIA, and with the THz receiver at the APEX. We analyzed them along
with ancillary spectra of HF and CH from HIFI. To deconvolve them from the
hyperfine structure and to separate the blend that is due to various velocity
components on the sightline, we fit model spectra consisting of an appropriate
number of Gaussian profiles using a method combining simulated annealing with
downhill simplex minimization. Together with HF and/or CH as a surrogate for
H2, and HI $\lambda$21 cm data, the molecular hydrogen fraction f^N\_H2 = N(H
2)/(N(H) + 2N(H 2)) can be determined. We then investigated abundance ratios as
a function of f^N\_H2. Results. The column density of OI is correlated at a
high significance with the amount of available molecular and atomic hydrogen,
with an atomic oxygen abundance of $3 \times 10 ^{-4}$ relative to H nuclei.
While the velocities of the absorption features of OH and OH+ are loosely
correlated and reflect the spiral arm crossings on the sightline, upon closer
inspection they display an anticorrespondence. The arm-to-interarm density
contrast is found to be higher in OH than in OH+. While both species can
coexist, with a higher abundance in OH than in OH+, the latter is found less
frequently in absence of OH than the other way around, which is a direct
consequence of the rapid destruction of OH+ by dissociative recombination when
not enough H2 is available. This conjecture has been substantiated by a
comparison between the OH/OH+ ratio with f^N\_H2, showing a clear correlation.
The hydrogen abstraction reaction chain OH+ (H2,H) H2O+ (H2,H)H3O+ is confirmed
as the pathway for the production of OH and H 2 O. Our estimate of the
branching ratio of the dissociative recombination of H3O+ to OH and H2O is
confined within the interval of 84 to 91%, which matches laboratory
measurements (74 to 83%). -- A correlation between the linewidths and column
densities of OH+ features is found to be significant with a false-alarm
probability below 5%. Such a correlation is predicted by models of interstellar
MHD turbulence. For OH the same correlation is found to be insignificant
because there are more narrow absorption features. Conclusions. While it is
difficult to assess the contributions of warm neutral-neutral chemistry to the
observed abundances, it seems fair to conclude that the predictions of cold
ion-neutral chemistry match the abundance patterns we observed.

  Lie groups","21 pages",,,,"math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  First we give a new proof of Goto's theorem for Lie algebras of compact
semisimple Lie groups using Coxeter transformations. Namely, every $x$ in $L =
\operatorname{Lie}(G)$ can be written as $x =[a, b]$ for some $a$, $b$ in $L$.
By using the same method, we give a new proof of the following theorem (thus
avoiding the classification tables of fundamental weights): in compact
semisimple Lie algebras, orthogonal Cartan subalgebras always exist (where one
of them can be chosen arbitrarily). Some of the consequences of this theorem
are the following. $(i)$ If $L=\operatorname{Lie}(G)$ is such a Lie algebra and
$C$ is any Cartan subalgebra of $L$, then the $G$-orbit of $C^{\perp}$ is all
of $L$. $(ii)$ The consequence in part $(i)$ answers a question by L. Florit
and W. Ziller on fatness of certain principal bundles. It also shows that in
our case, the commutator map $L \times L \to L$ is open at $(0, 0)$. $(iii)$
given any regular element $x$ of $L$, there exists a regular element $y$ such
that $L = [x, L] + [y,L]$ and $x$, $y$ are orthogonal. Then we generalize this
result about compact semisimple Lie algebras to the class of non-Hermitian real
semisimple Lie algebras having full rank.
  Finally, we survey some recent related results , and construct explicitly
orthogonal Cartan subalgebras in $\mathfrak{su}(n)$, $\mathfrak{sp}(n)$,
$\mathfrak{so}(n)$.

get labels on their data. Such markets have emerged recently as popular venues
for collecting annotations that are crucial in training machine learning models
in various applications. However, as jobs are tedious and payments are low,
errors are common in such crowdsourced labels. A common strategy to overcome
such noise in the answers is to add redundancy by getting multiple answers for
each task and aggregating them using some methods such as majority voting. For
such a system, there is a fundamental question of interest: how can we maximize
the accuracy given a fixed budget on how many responses we can collect on the
crowdsourcing system. We characterize this fundamental trade-off between the
budget (how many answers the requester can collect in total) and the accuracy
in the estimated labels. In particular, we ask whether adaptive task assignment
schemes lead to a more efficient trade-off between the accuracy and the budget.
  Adaptive schemes, where tasks are assigned adaptively based on the data
collected thus far, are widely used in practical crowdsourcing systems to
efficiently use a given fixed budget. However, existing theoretical analyses of
crowdsourcing systems suggest that the gain of adaptive task assignments is
minimal. To bridge this gap, we investigate this question under a strictly more
general probabilistic model, which has been recently introduced to model
practical crowdsourced annotations. Under this generalized Dawid-Skene model,
we characterize the fundamental trade-off between budget and accuracy. We
introduce a novel adaptive scheme that matches this fundamental limit. We
further quantify the fundamental gap between adaptive and non-adaptive schemes,
by comparing the trade-off with the one for non-adaptive schemes. Our analyses
confirm that the gap is significant.

  oscillations in single- and multi-frequency capacitive discharges",,,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The self-excitation of plasma series resonance (PSR) oscillations is a
prominent feature in the current of low pressure capacitive radio frequency
(RF) discharges. This resonance leads to high frequency oscillations of the
charge in the sheaths and enhances electron heating. Up to now, the phenomenon
has only been observed in asymmetric discharges. There, the nonlinearity in the
voltage balance, which is necessary for the self-excitation of resonance
oscillations with frequencies above the applied frequencies, is caused
predominantly by the quadratic contribution to the charge-voltage relation of
the plasma sheaths. Using PIC/MCC simulations of single- and multi- frequency
capacitive discharges and an equivalent circuit model, we demonstrate that
other mechanisms such as a cubic contribution to the charge-voltage relation of
the plasma sheaths and the time dependent bulk electron plasma frequency can
cause the self-excitation of PSR oscillations, as well. These mechanisms have
been neglected in previous models, but are important for the theoretical
description of the current in symmetric or weakly asymmetric discharges.

in the athermal rheology of soft materials at low but finite driving rates. A
key ingredient in our scenario is the presence of a self-consistent mechanical
noise that stems from the spatial superposition of long-range elastic responses
to localized plastically deforming regions. We study analytically a mean-field
model, in which this mechanical noise is accounted for by a stress diffusion
term coupled to the plastic activity. Within this description we show how a
dependence of the shear modulus and/or the local relaxation time on the shear
rate introduces corrections to the usual mean-field prediction, concerning the
Herschel-Bulkley-type rheological response of exponent 1/2. This feature of the
mean-field picture is then shown to be robust with respect to structural
disorder and partial relaxation of the local stress. We test this prediction
numerically on a mesoscopic lattice model that implements explicitly the
long-range elastic response to localized shear transformations, and we conclude
on how our scenario might be tested in rheological experiments.

diameter D at a single planar wall and between two parallel hard walls using
the second-virial density functional theory. The theory is implemented in the
three-state Zwanzig approximation, where only three mutually perpendicular
directions are allowed for the orientations of hard rods. The effect of varying
shape anisotropy is examined at L/D=10, 15 and 20. In contact with a single
hard wall, the density profiles show planar ordering, damped oscillatory
behavior, and wall induced surface ordering transition below the coexisting
isotropic density of bulk isotropic-nematic (I-N) phase transition. Upon
approaching the coexisting isotropic density, the thickness of nematic film
diverges logarithmically, i.e. the nematic wetting is complete for any shape
anisotropy. In the case of confinement between two parallel hard walls, it is
found that the continuous surface ordering transition depends strongly on the
distance between confining walls (H) for H<L, while it depends weakly on H for
H>L. The minimal density at which a surface ordering transition can be realized
is located at around H~2D for all studied shape anisotropies due to the strong
interference effect between the two hard walls. The first order I-N phase
transition of the bulk system becomes surface ordered isotropic (IB)-capillary
nematic (NB) phase transition in the slit pore. This first order IB-NB
transition weakens with decreasing pore width and terminates in a critical
point for all studied shape anisotropies.

azimuthally-averaged CH$_3$OH rotational temperature ($T_{rot}$) as a function
of sky-projected nucleocentric distance ($\rho$), fell by about 40 K between
$\rho=0$ and 2500 km on 28 June, whereas on 29 June, $T_{rot}$ fell by about 50

variations in CH$_3$OH rotational temperature are interpreted primarily as a

example, humans often maximize their expected reward when gambling and this is

betting strategies depending on how they ""feel"". If someone has experienced a
losing streak, they may ""feel"" that they are more likely to win on the next
hand even though the odds of the game have not changed. That is, their
decisions are driven by their emotional state. In this paper, we investigate
how the human brain responds to wins and losses during gambling. Using a
combination of local field potential recordings in human subjects performing a
financial decision-making task, spectral analyses, and non-parametric cluster
statistics, we investigated whether neural responses in different cognitive and
limbic brain areas differ between wins and losses after decisions are made. In
eleven subjects, the neural activity modulated significantly between win and
loss trials in one brain region: the anterior insula ($p=0.01$). In particular,
gamma activity (30-70 Hz) increased in the anterior insula when subjects just
realized that they won. Modulation of metabolic activity in the anterior insula

there are essentially two options for future financial regulation of systemic

fragility of global or domestic systemically important financial institutions

financial regulation could attempt strengthening the financial system as a

The proposed framework is built on characterizing the interference coupling by
pre-defined interference patterns, and performing resource allocation among
these patterns. In this way, the interference fluctuation caused by
(de)activating cells is explicitly taken into account when calculating the user
achievable rates. A tailored algorithm is developed to solve the formulated
problem in the dual domain by exploiting the problem structure, which gives a
significant complexity saving. Numerical results show a huge improvement in
energy saving achieved by the proposed scheme. The user association derived

signal waveforms --- a template bank --- chosen to cover the full signal space
of interest with as few template waveforms as possible. Although the component
black holes may have significant angular momenta (spin), previous searches for
BBHs have filtered LIGO and Virgo data using only waveforms where both
component spins are zero. This leads to a loss of signal-to-noise ratio for
signals where this is not the case. Combining the best available template
placement techniques and waveform models, we construct a template bank of GW
signals from BBHs with component spins $\chi_{1,2}\in [-0.99, 0.99]$ aligned
with the orbital angular momentum, component masses $m_{1,2}\in [2,
48]\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, and total mass $M_\mathrm{total} \leq
50\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. Using effective-one-body waveforms with spin effects, we
show that less than $3\%$ of the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of these
signals is lost due to the discreetness of the bank, using the early advanced
LIGO noise curve. We use simulated advanced LIGO noise to compare the
sensitivity of this bank to a non-spinning bank covering the same parameter
space. In doing so, we consider the competing effects between improved SNR and
signal-based vetoes, and the increase in the rate of false alarms of the
aligned-spin bank due to covering a larger parameter space. We find that the
aligned-spin bank can be a factor of $1.3$ -- $5$ more sensitive than a
non-spinning bank to BBHs with dimensionless spins $> +0.6$ and component
masses $\gtrsim 20\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. Even larger gains are obtained for
systems with equally high spins but smaller component masses.

measurements related to the cosmic optical background (COB), centered at 1

come from an indirect technique involving Gamma-ray spectra of bright blazars
with an absorption feature resulting from pair-production off of COB photons.
The cosmic infrared background (CIB) peaking at around 100 microns established
an energetically important background with an intensity comparable to the
optical background. This discovery paved the path for large aperture
far-infrared and sub-millimeter observations resulting in the discovery of
dusty, starbursting galaxies. Their role in galaxy formation and evolution
remains an active area of research in modern-day astrophysics. The extreme UV
background remains mostly unexplored and will be a challenge to measure due to
the high Galactic background and absorption of extragalactic photons by the
intergalactic medium at these EUV/soft X-ray energies. We also summarize our

for homogeneous but anisotropic (Bianchi) universes. Here, we prove that
$arbitrarily$ inhomogeneous and anisotropic cosmologies with ""flat"" (including
toroidal) and ""open"" (including compact hyperbolic) spatial topology that are
initially expanding must continue to expand forever at least in some region at
a rate bounded from below by a positive number, despite the presence of
arbitrarily large density fluctuations and/or the formation of black holes.
Because the set of 3-manifold topologies is countable, a single integer
determines the ultimate fate of the universe, and, in a specific sense, most
3-manifolds are ""flat"" or ""open"". Our result has important implications for
inflation: if there is a positive cosmological constant (or suitable
inflationary potential) and initial conditions for the inflaton, cosmologies
with ""flat"" or ""open"" topology must expand forever in some region at least as
fast as de Sitter space, and are therefore very likely to begin inflationary
expansion eventually, regardless of the scale of the inflationary energy or the
spectrum and amplitude of initial inhomogeneities and gravitational waves. Our
result is also significant for numerical general relativity, which often makes
use of periodic (toroidal) boundary conditions.

baryonic content of a galaxy to the observationally determined strength of its
gravitational potential. We found that the results are robust to changes in the
UVB. The strength of the stellar feedback shifts the results on the BTFR, but
does not help to form gas rich galaxies at late redshifts. Only by including
Pop III feedback are we able to produce galaxies that lie on the observational
BTFR and that have neutral gas and ongoing star formation at redshift zero.

around a simultaneous calculation of electrodynamics and thermodynamics. An
important sum rule, the compressibility sum rule, fails to be satisfied in the
usual calculation of the electromagnetic and thermodynamic response at the
Gaussian fluctuation level. Here we present a path integral scheme to address
this inconsistency. Specifically, at the leading order we argue that the
superconducting gap should be calculated using a different saddle point
condition modified by the presence of an external vector potential. This leads
to the well known gauge-invariant BCS electrodynamic response and is associated
with the usual (mean field) expression for thermodynamics. In this way the
compressibility sum rule is satisfied at the BCS level. Moreover, this scheme
can be readily extended to address arbitrary higher order fluctuation theories.
At any level this approach will lead to a gauge invariant and compressibility
sum rule consistent treatment of electrodynamics and thermodynamics.

investigate the hypothesis that collisions of stars with a fragmenting

3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to model a star with radius $10
R_{\odot}$ and mass $1 M_{\odot}$, representative of the missing population of
RGs, colliding with high density clumps. We find that multiple collisions with
clumps of column density $\gtrsim10^{8}\, {\rm g\,cm^{-2}}$ can strip a
substantial fraction of the star's envelope and in principle render it
invisible to observations. Simulations confirm that repeated impacts are
particularly efficient in driving mass loss as partially stripped RGs expand
and have increased cross sections for subsequent collisions. Because the
envelope is unbound on account of the kinetic energy of the star, any
significant amount of stripping of the RG population in the GC should be
mirrored by a systematic decay of their orbits and possibly by their enhanced
rotational velocity. To be viable, this scenario requires that the total mass
of the fragmenting disk has been several orders of magnitude higher than that
of the early type stars which now form the stellar disk in the GC.

explore how, nevertheless, the Witten index is sometimes intricately embedded

unexpectedly, however, the integral $L^2$ Witten index can be extracted
directly and easily from the twisted partition function of such theories. This
phenomenon is tied to the notion of the rational invariant that appears
naturally in the wall-crossing formulae, and offers a general mechanism of
reading off Witten index directly from the twisted partition function. Along
the way, we correct early numerical results for some of $\mathcal N=4,8,16$

G11.2-0.3 one of the youngest core-collapse SNRs in the Galaxy. However, we

larger, more diffuse region of radio emission and nonthermal X-rays. Central
soft thermal X-ray emission is anticorrelated with the PWN; that, and more
detailed morphological evidence, indicates that the reverse shock has already
reheated all ejecta and compressed the PWN. The pulsar characteristic
energy-loss timescale is well in excess of the remnant age, and we suggest that
the bright jets have been produced since the recompression. The relatively
pronounced shell and diffuse hard X-ray emission in the interior, enhanced at
the inner edge of the shell, indicate that the immediate circumstellar medium
into which G11.2-0.3 is expanding was quite anisotropic. We propose a possible
origin for G11.2-0.3 in a stripped-envelope progenitor that had lost almost all
its envelope mass, in an anisotropic wind or due to binary interaction, leaving
a compact core whose fast winds swept previously lost mass into a dense

an edge between two distinct vertices $H$ and $K$ if and only if $H\cap K \neq
1$ where $1$ denotes the trivial subgroup of $G$. In this paper we studied the
dominating sets in intersection graphs of finite groups. It turns out a subset
of the vertex set is a dominating set if and only if the union of the
corresponding subgroups contains the union of all minimal subgroups. We
classified abelian groups by their domination number and find upper bounds for
some specific classes of groups. Subgroup intersection is related with Burnside
rings. We introduce the notion of intersection graph of a $G$-set (somewhat
generalizing the ordinary definition of intersection graph of a group) and
establish a general upper bound for the domination number of $\Gamma(G)$ in
terms of subgroups satisfying a certain property in Burnside ring. Intersection
graph of $G$ is the $1$-skeleton of the simplicial complex whose faces are the
sets of proper subgroups which intersect non-trivially. We call this simplicial
complex intersection complex of $G$ and show that it shares the same homotopy
type with the order complex of proper non-trivial subgroups of $G$. We also
prove that if domination number of $\Gamma(G)$ is $1$, then intersection
complex of $G$ is contractible.

simulable under particular conditions. Specifically, if a circuit consists only
of nearest-neighbour matchgates, an efficient classical simulation is possible
if either (i) the input is a computational basis state and the simulation
requires computing probabilities of multi-qubit outcomes (including also
adaptive measurements), or (ii) if the input is an arbitrary product state, but
the output of the circuit consists of a single qubit. In this paper we extend
these results to show that matchgates are classically simulable even in the
most general combination of these settings, namely, if the inputs are arbitrary
product states, if the measurements are over arbitrarily many output qubits,
and if adaptive measurements are allowed. This remains true even for arbitrary
single-qubit measurements, albeit only in a weaker notion of classical
simulation. These results make for an interesting contrast with other
restricted models of computation, such as Clifford circuits or (bosonic) linear

only store a finite number of the identifiers they already heard about. The
community protocol model provides the power of a Turing machine with a $O(n\log

landscape that covers and extends already known results. Namely, by considering
the case of homonyms, that is to say the case when several agents may share the

identifier (population protocol model) to the case of unique identifiers
(community protocol model). We obtain in particular that any Turing Machine on

a CO$_{\rm core}$-NS/BH binary. The supernova (SN) explosion of the CO$_{\rm

standard concentric cell statistics applied to finite surveys. More generally,
no assumption on the separation is required for some specific moments of the
two-point statistics, for instance when predicting the generating function of

characteristics and the applications that utilize them have unique QoS
requirements. Although, the communication technologies have different
performance measurement parameters, the applications using these radio access

evaluate the QoS of the access networks and the overall network configuration

for small contraction ratios, sharp bounds for the exact values of the

automatically yield estimates of the corresponding measures, accurate in some

recover the exact values of the measures in all cases in which these values are

Definite (SPD) matrices, and considering the Riemannian geometry of the

account manifold geometry is typically done via embedding the manifolds in
tangent spaces, or Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). Recently, it was
shown that embedding such manifolds into a Random Projection Spaces (RPS),
rather than RKHS or tangent space, leads to higher classification and
clustering performance. However, based on structure and dimensionality of the
randomly generated hyperplanes, the classification performance over RPS may
vary significantly. In addition, fine-tuning RPS is data expensive (as it
requires validation-data), time consuming, and resource demanding. In this
paper, we introduce an approach to learn an optimized kernel-based projection
(with fixed dimensionality), by employing the concept of subspace clustering.
As such, we encode the association of data points to the underlying subspace of
each point, to generate meaningful hyperplanes. Further, we adopt the concept
of dictionary learning and sparse coding, and discriminative analysis, for the
optimized kernel-based projection space (OPS) on SPD manifolds. We validate our
algorithm on several classification tasks. The experiment results also
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on

statistical inference that is based on applying random perturbations followed
by optimization. This framework injects randomness to maximum a-posteriori
(MAP) predictors by randomly perturbing the potential function for the input. A
classic result from extreme value statistics asserts that perturb-max
operations generate unbiased samples from the Gibbs distribution using
high-dimensional perturbations. Unfortunately, the computational cost of
generating so many high-dimensional random variables can be prohibitive.
However, when the perturbations are of low dimension, sampling the perturb-max
prediction is as efficient as MAP optimization. This paper shows that the
expected value of perturb-max inference with low dimensional perturbations can
be used sequentially to generate unbiased samples from the Gibbs distribution.
Furthermore the expected value of the maximal perturbations is a natural bound
on the entropy of such perturb-max models. A measure concentration result for
perturb-max values shows that the deviation of their sampled average from its
expectation decays exponentially in the number of samples, allowing effective
approximation of the expectation.

the sum of the squares of the normalized importance weights. This formula,

perspective, the expression $\widehat{ESS}$ is related to the Euclidean

other possible ESS functions based on different discrepancy measures between
these two pmfs. Several examples are provided involving, for instance, the

underlying origin remains elusive. Lately, ZrTe5 has ignited renewed interest
because it is predicted that single-layer ZrTe5 is a two-dimensional
topological insulator and there is possibly a topological phase transition in
bulk ZrTe5. However, the topological nature of ZrTe5 is under debate as some
experiments point to its being a three-dimensional or quasi-two-dimensional
Dirac semimetal. Here we report high-resolution laser-based angle-resolved
photoemission measurements on ZrTe5. The electronic property of ZrTe5 is
dominated by two branches of nearly-linear-dispersion bands at the Brillouin
zone center. These two bands are separated by an energy gap that decreases with
decreasing temperature but persists down to the lowest temperature we measured
(~2 K). The overall electronic structure exhibits a dramatic temperature
dependence; it evolves from a p-type semimetal with a hole-like Fermi pocket at
high temperature, to a semiconductor around ~135 K where its resistivity
exhibits a peak, to an n-type semimetal with an electron-like Fermi pocket at
low temperature. These results indicate a clear electronic evidence of the
temperature-induced Lifshitz transition in ZrTe5. They provide a natural
understanding on the underlying origin of the resistivity anomaly at ~135 K and
its associated reversal of the charge carrier type. Our observations also
provide key information on deciphering the topological nature of ZrTe5 and

Based on the multi-scale nature of objects in images, our approach is built on
top of a hierarchical segmentation. We first identify the representative and
diverse exemplar clusters within each scale by using a diversity ranking
algorithm. Object proposals are obtained by selecting a subset from the
multi-scale segment pool via maximizing a submodular objective function, which
consists of a weighted coverage term, a single-scale diversity term and a
multi-scale reward term. The weighted coverage term forces the selected set of
object proposals to be representative and compact; the single-scale diversity
term encourages choosing segments from different exemplar clusters so that they
will cover as many object patterns as possible; the multi-scale reward term
encourages the selected proposals to be discriminative and selected from
multiple layers generated by the hierarchical image segmentation. The
experimental results on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and PASCAL VOC2012
segmentation dataset demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our object
proposal model. Additionally, we validate our object proposals in simultaneous
segmentation and detection and outperform the state-of-art performance.

operational and denotational. The former preciseness has been recently

describes the meaning of the type in accordance with the denotations of other

denotational preciseness of the subtyping for a synchronous multiparty session

For example, such a model could be used to create complex transactions out of
nested compensable transactions where a programmer-supplied compensation
defines the work required to ""unwind"" a transaction.

infrastructure coverage. Compared to terrestrial communications or those based
on high-altitude platforms (HAPs), on-demand wireless systems with low-altitude
UAVs are in general faster to deploy, more flexibly re-configured, and are
likely to have better communication channels due to the presence of short-range
line-of-sight (LoS) links. However, the utilization of highly mobile and
energy-constrained UAVs for wireless communications also introduces many new
challenges. In this article, we provide an overview of UAV-aided wireless

waves of several different equations: the wave equation for scalar-valued waves
such as acoustics; the wave equation for vector-valued waves such as
electromagnetism and elasticity; and a system that encompasses the
Schr{\""o}dinger equation. This homogenization applies when the wavelength is of
the order of the size of the medium periodicity cell. The travelling wave is
assumed to be the sum of two waves: a modulated Bloch carrier wave having
crystal wave vector $\Bk$ and frequency $\omega_1$ plus a modulated Bloch
carrier wave having crystal wave vector $\Bm$ and frequency $\omega_2$. We
derive effective equations for the modulating functions, and then prove that
there is no coupling in the effective equations between the two different waves
both in the scalar and the system cases. To be precise, we prove that there is
no coupling unless $\omega_1=\omega_2$ and $(\Bk-\Bm)\odot\Lambda \in 2\pi
\mathbb Z^d,$ where $\Lambda=(\lambda_1\lambda_2\dots\lambda_d)$ is the
periodicity cell of the medium and for any two vectors $a=(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_d),
b=(b_1,b_2,\dots,b_d)\in\mathbb R^d,$ the product $a\odot b$ is defined to be
the vector $(a_1b_1,a_2b_2,\dots,a_db_d).$ This last condition forces the
carrier waves to be equivalent Bloch waves meaning that the coupling constants
in the system of effective equations vanish.
  We use two-scale analysis and some new weak-convergence type lemmas. The
analysis is not at the same level of rigor as that of Allaire and coworkers who
use two-scale convergence theory to treat the problem, but has the advantage of
simplicity which will allow it to be easily extended to the case where there is
degeneracy of the Bloch eigenvalue.

the development of parametric subharmonic instability (PSI) in the upper layer
transfers energy from the forced primary wave into a pair of subharmonic

jointly learns a similarity measure over projected segments (e.g. trigrams) of
the pair, and subsequently, derives the corresponding attention vector for each

framework independent of the underlying representation learning, and it has
been applied to both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural

detects only one type of feature, but we know that neurons can be multifaceted,
in that they fire in response to many different types of features: for example,
a grocery store class neuron must activate either for rows of produce or for a
storefront. Previous activation maximization techniques constructed images
without regard for the multiple different facets of a neuron, creating
inappropriate mixes of colors, parts of objects, scales, orientations, etc.
Here, we introduce an algorithm that explicitly uncovers the multiple facets of
each neuron by producing a synthetic visualization of each of the types of
images that activate a neuron. We also introduce regularization methods that
produce state-of-the-art results in terms of the interpretability of images
obtained by activation maximization. By separately synthesizing each type of
image a neuron fires in response to, the visualizations have more appropriate
colors and coherent global structure. Multifaceted feature visualization thus
provides a clearer and more comprehensive description of the role of each

frequency band with negligible thermal noise. The proposed system consists of a
minimally supported millimeter scale pendulum mounted in a Double End-Mirror
Sloshing (DEMS) cavity that is topologically equivalent to a
Membrane-in-the-Middle (MIM) cavity. The radiation pressure inside the
high-finesse cavity allows for high optical stiffness, cancellation of terms
which lead to unwanted negative damping and suppression of quantum radiation
pressure noise. We solve for the optical spring dynamics of the system using
the Hamiltonian, find the noise spectral density and show that stable optical
trapping is possible. We also assess various loss mechanisms, one of the most
important being the acceleration loss due to the optical spring. We show that
practical devices, starting from a centre-of-mass pendulum frequency of 0.1 Hz,
could achieve a maximum quality factor of $10^{14}$ with optical spring
stiffened frequency 1-10 kHz. Small resonators of mass 1 $\mu$g or less could

observations of binary inspiral of black holes could reveal or constrain
quantum modifications to black hole dynamics, such as are required to preserve
postulates of quantum mechanics. Different proposals for such modifications are
characterized by different scales, and the size of these scales relative to
those probed by observation of inspiral signals is important in determining the
feasibility of finding experimental signatures. Certain scenarios with strong
quantum modifications in a region extending well outside the horizon are
expected to modify classical evolution, and distort the near-peak gravitational
wave signal, suggesting a search for departures from waveforms predicted by
general relativity. The near agreement of the GW150914 signal with such
waveforms is discussed, and indicates constraints on some such scenarios.
Important strategies for more precise future tests are 1) to develop more
precise predictions from scenarios proposing quantum modifications, and 2)
searching for observed deviations from numerical relativity predictions via
analysis of gravity wave data, particularly focussing on the signal region
corresponding to plunge and merger.

least effort principle to perform coherent group navigation and present
efficient inter-group and intra-group maintenance techniques. We extend the
reciprocal collision avoidance scheme to perform agent-group and group-group

the large variations in the center-of-mass positions of these minima vs

a strong coupling in these molecules between surface mobility and shape or size

In the linear regime, Alfv\'{e}n wave reflection is triggered only by the
inhomogeneity of the medium, whereas in the nonlinear regime, it can occur via
nonlinear wave-wave interactions. Such nonlinear reflection (backscattering) is
typified by decay instability. In most studies of decay instabilities, the
initial condition has been a circularly polarized Alfv\'{e}n wave. In this
study we consider a linearly polarized Alfv\'en wave, which drives density
fluctuations by its magnetic pressure force. For generality, we also assume a
broadband wave with a red-noise spectrum. In the data analysis, we decompose
the fluctuations into characteristic variables using local eigenvectors, thus
revealing the behaviors of the individual modes. Different from
circular-polarization case, we find that the wave steepening produces a new
energy channel from the parent Alfv\'en wave to the backscattered one. Such
nonlinear reflection explains the observed increasing energy ratio of the
sunward to the anti-sunward Alfv\'{e}nic fluctuations in the solar wind with
distance against the dynamical alignment effect.

J1823-3021A in NGC 6624 and PSR B1821-24 in M28, have been recently discovered
to emit pulsed GeV gamma-rays. These MSPs are expected to eject energetic
leptons. Therefore, GCs have been proposed to produce GeV-TeV gamma-rays as a
result of the comptonization process of the background radiation within a GC.
We develop this general scenario by taking into account not only the diffusion
process of leptons within a GC but also their advection with the wind from the
GC. Moreover, we consider distribution of MSP within a GC and the effects
related to the non-central location of the dominating, energetic MSP. Such more
complete scenario is considered for the modelling of the GeV-TeV gamma-ray
emission from the core collapsed GC M15 and also for GCs which contain recently
discovered energetic MSPs within NGC 6624 and M28. The confrontation of the
modelling of the gamma-ray emission with the observations with the present
Cherenkov telescopes and the future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) allows to
constrain more reliably the efficiency of lepton production within the inner
magnetosphere of the MSPs and re-accelerated in their vicinity. We discuss the
expected limits on this parameter in the context of expectations from the
pulsar models. we conclude that deep observations of GCs, even with the present
sensitivity of Cherenkov telescopes (H.E.S.S., MAGIC, VERITAS), should start to
constrain the models for the acceleration and radiation processes of leptons
within the inner pulsar magnetosphere and its surrounding.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stw347",,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The highly stable spin of neutron stars can be exploited for a variety of
(astro-)physical investigations. In particular arrays of pulsars with
rotational periods of the order of milliseconds can be used to detect
correlated signals such as those caused by gravitational waves. Three such
""Pulsar Timing Arrays"" (PTAs) have been set up around the world over the past
decades and collectively form the ""International"" PTA (IPTA). In this paper, we
describe the first joint analysis of the data from the three regional PTAs,
i.e. of the first IPTA data set. We describe the available PTA data, the
approach presently followed for its combination and suggest improvements for
future PTA research. Particular attention is paid to subtle details (such as
underestimation of measurement uncertainty and long-period noise) that have
often been ignored but which become important in this unprecedentedly large and
inhomogeneous data set. We identify and describe in detail several factors that
complicate IPTA research and provide recommendations for future pulsar timing
efforts. The first IPTA data release presented here (and available online) is
used to demonstrate the IPTA's potential of improving upon gravitational-wave
limits placed by individual PTAs by a factor of ~2 and provides a 2-sigma limit
on the dimensionless amplitude of a stochastic GWB of 1.7x10^{-15} at a
frequency of 1 yr^{-1}. This is 1.7 times less constraining than the limit
placed by (Shannon et al. 2015), due mostly to the more recent, high-quality
data they used.

the transport in a discrete fracture network taking into account the mass
exchanges with the surrounding matrix. The discretization of the Darcy fluxes
is based on the Vertex Approximate Gradient finite volume scheme adapted to
polyhedral meshes and to heterogeneous anisotropic media, and the transport
equation is discretized by a first order upwind scheme combined with an Euler
explicit integration in time. The parallelization is based on the SPMD (Single
Program, Multiple Data) paradigm and relies on a distribution of the mesh on
the processes with one layer of ghost cells in order to allow for a local
assembly of the discrete systems. The linear system for the Darcy flow is
solved using different linear solvers and preconditioners implemented in the
PETSc and Trilinos libraries. The convergence of the scheme is validated on two
original analytical solutions with one and four intersecting fractures. Then,
the parallel efficiency of the algorithm is assessed on up to 512 processes
with different types of meshes, different matrix fracture permeability ratios,
and different levels of complexity of the fracture network.

cryptographic primitive that allows fine-grained access control, by giving
different rights to different users not only in terms of which messages they
are allowed to receive, but also which messages they are allowed to send.
  Classical examples of security policies for information flow are the well
known Bell-Lapadula [BL73] or Biba [Bib75] model: in a nutshell, the
Bell-Lapadula model assigns roles to every user in the system (e.g., public,
secret and top-secret). A users' role specifies which messages the user is
allowed to receive (i.e., the no read-up rule, meaning that users with public
clearance should not be able to read messages marked as secret or top-secret)
but also which messages the user is allowed to send (i.e., the no write-down
rule, meaning that a user with top-secret clearance should not be able to write
messages marked as secret or public).
  To the best of our knowledge, no existing cryptographic primitive allows for
even this simple form of access control, since no existing cryptographic
primitive enforces any restriction on what kind of messages one should be able
to encrypt.
  Our contributions are: - Introducing and formally defining access control
encryption (ACE); - A construction of ACE with complexity linear in the number
of the roles based on classic number theoretic assumptions (DDH, Paillier); - A
construction of ACE with complexity polylogarithmic in the number of roles
based on recent results on cryptographic obfuscation;

allows for a number of missed edges or incorrectly-included edges, in contrast
with the widely-studied exact recovery problem. Our main results provide
information-theoretic lower bounds on the sample complexity for graph classes
imposing constraints on the number of edges, maximal degree, and other
properties. We identify a broad range of scenarios where, either up to constant
factors or logarithmic factors, our lower bounds match the best known lower
bounds for the exact recovery criterion, several of which are known to be tight
or near-tight. Hence, in these cases, approximate recovery has a similar
difficulty to exact recovery in the minimax sense.
  Our bounds are obtained via a modification of Fano's inequality for handling
the approximate recovery criterion, along with suitably-designed ensembles of
graphs that can broadly be classed into two categories: (i) Those containing
graphs that contain several isolated edges or cliques and are thus difficult to
distinguish from the empty graph; (ii) Those containing graphs for which
certain groups of nodes are highly correlated, thus making it difficult to
determine precisely which edges connect them. We support our theoretical
results on these ensembles with numerical experiments.

fast coordinate descent algorithm whose parameters are updated by analytical

graph metrics and describes the tendency of high degree nodes to be directly

be interpreted as a first order measure of the connection between nodes, i.e.
the first autocorrelation of the degree-degree vector. Even though
assortativity has been used so extensively, to the author's knowledge, no
attempt has been made to extend it theoretically. This is the scope of our
paper. We will introduce higher order assortativity by extending the Newman
index based on a suitable choice of the matrix driving the connections. Higher
order assortativity will be defined for paths, shortest paths, random walks of
a given time length, connecting any couple of nodes. The Newman assortativity
is achieved for each of these measures when the matrix is the adjacency matrix,

assortativity indexes can be used for describing a variety of real networks,
help discriminating networks having the same Newman index and may reveal new
topological network features.

divergent contribution to the vacuum energy, so the latter has to be
renormalized before computing physical quantities. The vacuum term is important
for restoration of chiral symmetry at finite temperature and $\mu_5\neq0$,
therefore we present several plausible renormalization schemes for the
ultraviolet divergences at $\mu_5\neq0$. Then we compute the critical
temperature as a function of $\mu_5$. The main result of our study is that the
choice of a renormalization scheme affects the critical temperature; among the
three renormalization schemes we investigate, there exists one in which the
critical temperature increases with $\mu_5$, a result which has not been found

core design features of human language. Duality of patterning refers for
instance to the organization of the meaningful elements in a language at two
distinct levels: a combinatorial level where meaningless forms are combined
into meaningful forms and a compositional level where meaningful forms are
composed into larger lexical units. The question remains wide open regarding
how such a structure could have emerged. Furthermore a clear mathematical
framework to quantify this phenomenon is still lacking. The aim of this paper
is that of addressing these two aspects in a self-consistent way. First, we
introduce suitable measures to quantify the level of combinatoriality and
compositionality in a language, and present a framework to estimate these
observables in human natural languages. Second, we show that the theoretical
predictions of a multi-agents modeling scheme, namely the Blending Game, are in
surprisingly good agreement with empirical data. In the Blending Game a
population of individuals plays language games aiming at success in
communication. It is remarkable that the two sides of duality of patterning
emerge simultaneously as a consequence of a pure cultural dynamics in a
simulated environment that contains meaningful relations, provided a simple
constraint on message transmission fidelity is also considered.

signals often reside has long been at the center of numerous algorithms in the
signal processing and machine learning literature during the past few decades.
At the same time, working with incomplete (partly observed) large scale
datasets has recently been commonplace for diverse reasons. This so called {\it
big data era} we are currently living calls for devising online subspace
learning algorithms that can suitably handle incomplete data. Their envisaged
objective is to {\it recursively} estimate the unknown subspace by processing
streaming data sequentially, thus reducing computational complexity, while
obviating the need for storing the whole dataset in memory. In this paper, an
online variational Bayes subspace learning algorithm from partial observations
is presented. To account for the unawareness of the true rank of the subspace,
commonly met in practice, low-rankness is explicitly imposed on the sought
subspace data matrix by exploiting sparse Bayesian learning principles.
Moreover, sparsity, {\it simultaneously} to low-rankness, is favored on the
subspace matrix by the sophisticated hierarchical Bayesian scheme that is
adopted. In doing so, the proposed algorithm becomes adept in dealing with
applications whereby the underlying subspace may be also sparse, as, e.g., in
sparse dictionary learning problems. As shown, the new subspace tracking scheme
outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts in terms of estimation accuracy,
in a variety of experiments conducted on simulated and real data.

  and its Application on Heart Failure Prediction","45 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: To transform heterogeneous clinical data from electronic health
records into clinically meaningful constructed features using data driven
method that rely, in part, on temporal relations among data. Materials and
Methods: The clinically meaningful representations of medical concepts and
patients are the key for health analytic applications. Most of existing
approaches directly construct features mapped to raw data (e.g., ICD or CPT
codes), or utilize some ontology mapping such as SNOMED codes. However, none of
the existing approaches leverage EHR data directly for learning such concept
representation. We propose a new way to represent heterogeneous medical
concepts (e.g., diagnoses, medications and procedures) based on co-occurrence
patterns in longitudinal electronic health records. The intuition behind the
method is to map medical concepts that are co-occuring closely in time to
similar concept vectors so that their distance will be small. We also derive a
simple method to construct patient vectors from the related medical concept
vectors. Results: For qualitative evaluation, we study similar medical concepts
across diagnosis, medication and procedure. In quantitative evaluation, our
proposed representation significantly improves the predictive modeling
performance for onset of heart failure (HF), where classification methods (e.g.
logistic regression, neural network, support vector machine and K-nearest
neighbors) achieve up to 23% improvement in area under the ROC curve (AUC)
using this proposed representation. Conclusion: We proposed an effective method
for patient and medical concept representation learning. The resulting
representation can map relevant concepts together and also improves predictive
modeling performance.

phases of hard core boson (HCB) model using stochastic series expansion (SSE).
We demonstrate from our numerical calculations that the normal phase of HCBs in
two dimensions can be an ideal conductor with dissipationless transport. In two
dimensions, when the ground state is a SF, the superfluid stiffness drops to
zero with a Kosterlitz-Thouless type transition at $T_{KT}$. The Drude weight,
though is equal to the stiffness below $T_{KT}$, surprisingly stays finite even
for temperatures above $T_{KT}$ indicating the non-dissipative transport in the
normal state of this system. In contrast to this in a three dimensional SF
phase, where the superfluid stiffness goes to zero continuously with a second
order phase transition at $T_c$, Drude weight also goes to zero at $T_c$ as
expected. We also calculated the Drude weight in a 2D SS phase, where the
charge density wave (CDW) order coexists with superfluidity. For the SS phase
we studied, superfluidity is lost via Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at
$T_{KT}$ and the transition temperature for the CDW order is larger than
$T_{KT}$. In striped SS phase where the CDW order breaks the rotational
symmetry of the lattice, for $T > T_{KT}$, the system behaves like an ideal
conductor along one of the lattice direction while along the other direction it
behaves like an insulator. In contrast to this, in star-SS phase, Drude weight
along both the lattice directions goes to zero along with the superfluid
stiffness and for $T > T_{KT}$ we have a finite temperature phase of a CDW
insulator.

instantaneous burst of isotropic radiation is considered from the moment of its
beginning at some initial redshift z0 to the moment of its registration now (at
z=0). Thomson scattering by free electrons and scattering in primordial
hydrogen lines Ha, Hb, Pa and Pb are considered as the sources of opacity and
when calculating an albedo of a single scattering in the lines we take into
account deactivation of the upper levels of transitions by background blackbody
radiation. Profiles for these lines in a burst spectrum are calculated for
different distances from the center of the burst and different values of z0. In
the first approximation these profiles do not depend on spectrum and intensity
of a burst radiation. It is shown that lines are in absorption at sufficiently
large distance but emission components may appear as a distance decreases and
it becomes stronger while absorption component weakens with a further distance
decrease. For the sum of Ha and Hb lines the depth of absorption can reach 2e-4
while for the sum of Pa and Pb lines the maximum absorption is about 7e-6. So
that the relative magnitude of temperature fluctuations lies between 1e-7 and
1e-9. The calculations were fulfiled for bursts with different initial sizes.
For the same z0 the profiles of hydrogen lines are practically coinside for
burst sizes lower than someone and for greater ones the lines weaken as the
burst size grows.

regimes, and their activity levels are well described by Ro, the ratio between
P_rot and the convective turnover time. Very young PMS stars show, similarly to
MS stars, intense magnetic activity. However they do not show clear
activity-rotation trends, and it still debated which stellar parameters
determine their magnetic activity levels. To bridge the gap between MS and PMS
stars, we studied the activity-rotation relation in the young cluster h Per, a
~13 Myr old cluster, that contains both fast and slow rotators, whose members
have ended their accretion phase and have already developed a radiative core.
It offers us the opportunity to study the activity level of intermediate-age
PMS stars with different rotational velocities, excluding any interactions with
the circumstellar environment. We constrained the magnetic activity levels of h
Per members measuring their X-ray emission from a Chandra observation, while
P_rot were obtained by Moraux et al. (2013). We collected a final catalog of
414 h Per members with known P_rot, T_eff, M_star, with 169 of them having also
detected X-ray emission. We found that h Per members, with 1.0 M_sun < M_star <
1.4 M_sun, display different activity regimes: fast rotators show
supersaturation, while slower rotators have activity levels compatible to the
non-saturated regime. At 13 Myr h Per is therefore the youngest cluster showing
activity-rotation regimes analogous to that of MS stars, indicating that, at
this age, magnetic field production is likely regulated by the alpha-Omega type
dynamo. Moreover we observed that supersaturation is better described by P_rot
than Ro, and that the observed patterns are compatible with the hypothesis of
centrifugal stripping. In this scenario we inferred that coronae can produce
structures as large as ~2 R_star above the stellar surface.

  Effects",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Linear mixed models (LMMs) are used as an important tool in the data analysis
of repeated measures and longitudinal studies. The most common form of LMMs
utilize a normal distribution to model the random effects. Such assumptions can
often lead to misspecification errors when the random effects are not normal.
One approach to remedy the misspecification errors is to utilize a point-mass
distribution to model the random effects; this is known as the nonparametric
maximum likelihood-fitted (NPML) model. The NPML model is flexible but requires
a large number of parameters to characterize the random-effects distribution.
It is often natural to assume that the random-effects distribution be at least
marginally symmetric. The marginally symmetric NPML (MSNPML) random-effects
model is introduced, which assumes a marginally symmetric point-mass
distribution for the random effects. Under the symmetry assumption, the MSNPML
model utilizes half the number of parameters to characterize the same number of
point masses as the NPML model; thus the model confers an advantage in economy
and parsimony. An EM-type algorithm is presented for the maximum likelihood
(ML) estimation of LMMs with MSNPML random effects; the algorithm is shown to
monotonically increase the log-likelihood and is proven to be convergent to a
stationary point of the log-likelihood function in the case of convergence.
Furthermore, it is shown that the ML estimator is consistent and asymptotically
normal under certain conditions, and the estimation of quantities such as the
random-effects covariance matrix and individual a posteriori expectations is
demonstrated.

introduction of a single cheater under gradually changing conditions. We
observe a systematic increase in the average time it takes for cheaters to be

risk based on changes in community structure and composition. Nonetheless,
reliable detection depends on the mechanism that governs how cheaters evolve in

instruments like e.g. Precision IceCube Next Generation Upgrade (PINGU). For
radio-Cherenkov experiments which use the presence of a clear Cherenkov cone to
determine the arrival direction, any variation in emission angle will directly
and linearly translate into a change in apparent neutrino direction. In
closing, we also describe a simple experiment to test this formalism, and
calculate the impact of anisotropy on light-yields from lead tungstate crystals
as used, for example, in the CMS calorimeter at the CERN LHC.

support Quality of Service (QoS) for wireless local area networks: Enhanced
Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) and HCF Controlled Channel Access (HCCA).
EDCA provides fair prioritized QoS support while HCCA guarantees parameterized
QoS for the traffics with rigid QoS requirements. The latter shows higher QoS
provisioning with Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffics. However, it does not
efficiently cope with the fluctuation of the Variable Bit Rate (VBR) video
streams since its reference scheduler generates a schedule based on the mean
characteristics of the traffic. Scheduling based on theses characteristics is
not always accurate as these tra_cs show high irregularity over the time. In
this paper, we propose an enhancement on the HCCA polling mechanism to address
the problem of scheduling pre-recorded VBR video streams. Our approach enhances
the polling mechanism by feed-backing the arrival time of the subsequent video
frame of the uplink traffic obtained through cross-layering approach.
Simulation experiments have been conducted on several publicly available video
traces in order to show the efficiency of our mechanism. The simulation results
reveal the efficiency of the proposed mechanism in providing less delay and
high throughput with conserving medium channel through minimizing the number of
Null-Frames caused by wasted polls

an active role in examining chemical and physical properties of ingredients and
as such lends itself to more scientific approaches to finding novel ingredient
pairings. With thousands of ingredients and molecules, which participate in the
creation of each ingredient's flavour, it can be difficult to find compatible
flavours in an efficient manner. Existing literature is focused mainly on
analysis of already established cuisine based on the flavour profile of its
ingredients, but fails to consider the potential in finding flavour
compatibility for use in creation of completely new recipes. Expressing
relationships between ingredients and their molecular structure as a bipartite
network opens up this problem to effective analysis with methods from network
science. We describe a series of experiments on a database of food using
network analysis, which produce a set of compatible ingredients that can be
used in creation of new recipes. We expect this approach and its results to
dramatically simplify the creation of new recipes with previously unseen and
fresh combinations of ingredients.

Several quantum confined exciton states are experimentally observed as narrow
exciton resonances with various profiles. A standard approach for the
phenomenological analysis of the profiles is generalized by introducing of
different phase shifts for the light waves reflected from the QWs at different
exciton resonances. Perfect agreement of the phenomenological fit to the
experimentally observed exciton spectra for high-quality structures allowed us
to obtain reliable parameters of the exciton resonances including the exciton
transition energies, the radiative broadenings, and the phase shifts. A direct
numerical solution of Schr\""{o}dinger equation for the heavy-hole excitons in
asymmetric QWs is used for microscopic modeling of the exciton resonances.
Remarkable agreement with the experiment is achieved when the effect of indium

segregation results in a modification of the potential profile, in particular,

with small aperiodic autocorrelations relative to the sequence length. One of
the main motivations is that a sequence with small aperiodic autocorrelations
is intrinsically suited for the separation of signals from noise, and therefore
has natural applications in digital communications. This survey reviews the
state of knowledge concerning the two central problems in this area: How small
can the aperiodic autocorrelations of a binary or a unimodular sequence
collectively be and how can we efficiently find the best such sequences? Since
the analysis and construction of sequences with small aperiodic
autocorrelations is closely tied to the (often much easier) analysis of
periodic autocorrelation properties, several fundamental results on

visibility function that indicates if a surface point is seen from a camera can
often not be formulated in closed form, and is in general discrete and
non-differentiable at occlusion boundaries. We present a new scene

smooth, analytically differentiable, and efficient to optimize pose similarity
energies with rigorous occlusion handling, fewer local minima, and
experimentally verified improved convergence of numerical optimization. The
underlying idea is a new image formation model that represents opaque objects
by a translucent medium with a smooth Gaussian density distribution which turns

how to compare two coefficients $\alpha_{C,1}$ and $\alpha_{C,2}$. The null
hypothesis of interest is $H_0 : \alpha_{C,1} = \alpha_{C,2}$, which we test
against one-or two-sided alternatives. For this purpose, resampling-based

better control of the type I error, in finite or very small sample sizes, when
the state-of-affairs \textit{asymptotically distribution-free} (ADF)

Procedures define communications declaratively using global descriptions, and

average have fewer friends than their friends do. The generalized friendship
paradox is an extension to attributes other than the number of friends. The
friendship paradox and its generalized version have gathered recent attention
due to the information they provide about network structure and local
inequalities. In this paper, we propose several measures of nodal qualities
which capture different aspects of their activities and influence in online
social networks. Using these measures we analyse the prevalence of the
generalized friendship paradox over Twitter and we report high levels of
prevalence (up to over 90\% of nodes). We contend that this prevalence of the
friendship paradox and its generalized version arise because of the
hierarchical nature of the connections in the network. This hierarchy is nested
as opposed to being star-like. We conclude that these paradoxes are collective
phenomena not created merely by a minority of well-connected or high-attribute

target volume (PTV) is a prerequisite for effective treatment in percutaneous
radiation therapy. Conventional imaging modalities used to ensure exact
positioning for treatment typically involve additional radiation exposure of
the patient. A different approach to patient alignment without additional
exposure is provided by optical 3D surface scanning and registration systems.
  We investigated two systems Catalyst and AlignRT, which allowed us to
generate and validate surface images of 50 patients undergoing irradiation on a
Tomotherapy system. We compared the positions proposed by these two surface
imaging systems (SIS) with the actual adjustments in patient positions made on
the basis of MVCT scans. With the two SIS, the surface of every single patient
was repeatedly recorded throughout treatment. In addition, we performed a
systematic analysis of both systems using a body phantom.
  At least 10 surface images were available from each patient included in the
analysis. The large number of patients allowed us to subdivide the study
population into three groups by body region treated: head & neck, chest, and
pelvic. The results for each of these three body regions were separately
analyzed. Thus, the focus of our investigation is on body regions registered
with the two systems rather than tumor entities. For AlignRT, for instance, we
found an improvement in positioning for the Pelvic region of 0.9mm in 75% and
6.4mm in 95% of the collected data in comparison to conventional marker
alignment.
  The two systems were most accurate in the head & neck region, where
conventional mask alignment is already sufficiently accurate. The other two
body regions, pelvic and chest, might benefit from positioning by SIS. But for
both systems there is still a need for improvement to reduce statistical
variation.

$\kappa = \lambda / \xi$ (the ratio of magnetic to superconducting healing
lengths) both large and small. On the one hand, the combination of our
estimates with published results using a two-gap model for MgB${}_2$ suggests
high anisotropy of the superheating field near zero temperature. On the other
hand, within Ginzburg-Landau theory for a single gap, we see that the
superheating field shows significant anisotropy only when the crystal
anisotropy is large and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\kappa$ is small. We
then conclude that only small anisotropies in the superheating field are
expected for typical unconventional superconductors near the critical
temperature. Using a generalized form of Ginzburg Landau theory, we do a
quantitative calculation for the anisotropic superheating field by mapping the
problem to the isotropic case, and present a phase diagram in terms of
anisotropy and $\kappa$, showing type I, type II, or mixed behavior (within

The input to the task is a partial order of events, which models actions
performed on or by the system and specifies ordering constraints between them.
The task is to determine if some scheduling of these events can result in a
bug. The number of schedules to be explored can, in general, be exponential.
  Empirically, many bugs in concurrent programs have been observed to have
small bug depth; that is, these bugs are exposed by every schedule that orders
$d$ specific events in a particular way, irrespective of how the other events
are ordered, and $d$ is small compared to the total number of events. To find
all bugs of depth $d$, one needs to only test a $d$-hitting family of
schedules: we call a set of schedules a $d$-hitting family if for each set of
$d$ events, and for each allowed ordering of these events, there is some
schedule in the family that executes these events in this ordering. The size of
a $d$-hitting family may be much smaller than the number of all possible
schedules, and a natural question is whether one can find $d$-hitting families
of schedules that have small size.
  In general, finding the size of optimal $d$-hitting families is hard, even
for $d=2$. We show, however, that when the partial order is a tree, one can
explicitly construct $d$-hitting families of schedules of small size. When the
tree is balanced, our constructions are polylogarithmic in the number of

stringent constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.
In particular, the distributions of the kinematical and angular variables that
characterise heavy me- son multibody decays are non trivial and can sign the
underlying interaction physics. In the era of high luminosity opened by the
advent of the Large Hadron Collider and of Flavor Factories, differential
measurements are less and less dominated by statistical precision and require a
precise determination of efficiencies that depend simultaneously on several
variables and do not factorise in these variables. This docu- ment is a
reflection on the potential of multivariate techniques for the determination of
such multidimensional efficiencies. We carried out two case studies that show
that multilayer perceptron neural networks can determine and correct for the
distortions introduced by reconstruction and selection criteria in the
multidimensional phase space of the decays $B^{0}\rightarrow K^{*0}(\rightarrow
K^{+}\pi^{-}) \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ and $D^{0}\rightarrow
K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$, at the price of a minimal analysis effort. We
conclude that this method can already be used for measurements which
statistical precision does not yet reach the percent level and that with more
sophisticated machine learning methods, the aforementioned potential is very

Unfortunately, controlling the false detection rate (type I error rate) of such
procedures may lead to excessively stringent acceptance criteria. In the recent
physics literature, two promising statistical tools have been proposed to
overcome these limitations. In 2005, a method to ""find needles in haystacks""

Gross and Vitells [2] in the context of the ""look elsewhere effect"" and trial

an artificial inflation of statistical power that stems from an increase in the
false detection rate, whereas the two methods exhibit similar performance for
large sample sizes. We apply the methods to realistic simulations of the Fermi
Large Area Telescope data, in particular the search for dark matter
annihilation lines. Further, we discuss the counter-intutive scenario where the
look-elsewhere corrections are more conservative than much more computationally
efficient corrections for multiple hypothesis testing. Finally, we provide

negative curvature to investigate the geometry of infinitely presented

their 'contracting geodesics', which should be thought of as the geodesics that
behave hyperbolically.
  We show that every degree of contraction can be achieved by a geodesic in a
finitely generated group. We construct the first example of a finitely
generated group $G$ containing an element $g$ that is strongly contracting with
respect to one finite generating set of $G$ and not strongly contracting with
respect to another. In the case of classical $C'(1/6)$ small cancellation
groups we give complete characterizations of geodesics that are Morse and that
are strongly contracting.
  We show that many graphical $Gr'(1/6)$ small cancellation groups contain
strongly contracting elements and, in particular, are growth tight. We
construct uncountably many quasi-isometry classes of finitely generated,
torsion-free groups in which every maximal cyclic subgroup is hyperbolically
embedded. These are the first examples of this kind that are not subgroups of
hyperbolic groups.
  In the course of our analysis we show that if the defining graph of a

elements of the group have translation lengths that are rational and bounded
away from zero.

(MISO) networks with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT) has attracted significant attentions. An achievable scheme is known as
rate-splitting (RS) that integrates common-message-multicasting and
private-message-unicasting. In this paper, focusing on the general $K$-cell
MISO IC where the CSIT of each interference link has an arbitrary quality of
imperfectness, we firstly identify the DoF region achieved by RS. Secondly, we
introduce a novel scheme, so called Topological RS (TRS), whose novelties
compared to RS lie in a multi-layer structure and transmitting multiple common
messages to be decoded by groups of users rather than all users. The design of
TRS is motivated by a novel interpretation of the $K$-cell IC with imperfect
CSIT as a weighted-sum of a series of partially connected networks. We show
that the DoF region achieved by TRS covers that achieved by RS. Also, we find
the maximal sum DoF achieved by TRS via hypergraph fractional packing, which
yields the best sum DoF so far. Lastly, for a realistic scenario where each
user is connected to three dominant transmitters, we identify the sufficient
condition where TRS strictly outperforms conventional schemes.

result in suboptimal solutions. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate how
these three issues can be modeled as one integrated optimization problem. In

Mixed-Integer Linear Program. Afterwards, we present an extended solution

extensive experimental results over both synthetic and real datasets show that

i.e., we show that if there is an approximate solution of an invariance
equation which also satisfies some non-degeneracy conditions, then there is a
true solution nearby. The a-posteriori format also has other automatic
consequences (smooth dependence on parameters, bootstrap of regularity, etc.).
The method of proof is based on an iterative method to solve a functional
equation for the parameterization of the torus satisfying the invariance
equations and for parametrization of directions invariant under the
linearizatation. The iterative method does not use transformation theory or
action-angle variables. It does not assume that the system is close to

abstract result applies to some concrete examples, including the scalar
Boussinesq equation and the Boussinesq system so that we construct {\sl small

  Triangulation",,,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a new O(nlog(n)) algorithm for computing the convex hull
of a set of 3 dimensional points. The algorithm first sorts the point in
(x,y,z) then incrementally adds sorted points to the convex hull using the
constraint that each new point added to the hull can 'see' at least one facet
touching the last point added. The reduces the search time for adding new
points. The algorithm belongs to the family of swept hull algorithms.
  While slower than q-hull for the general case it significantly outperforms
q-hull for the pathological case where all of the points are on the 3D hull (as
is the case for Delaunay triangulation). The algorithm has been named the
'Newton Apple Wrapper algorithm' and has been released under GPL in C++.

motility-induced clustering transition in self-propelled particle systems, we
study an individual model and its corresponding Self-Organized Hydrodynamic
model for collective behaviour that incorporates a density-dependent velocity,
as well as inter-particle alignment. The modal analysis of the hydrodynamic
model elucidates the relationship between the stability of the equilibria and
the changing velocity, and the formation of clusters. We find, in agreement
with earlier results for non-aligning particles, that the key criterion for
stability is $(\rho v(\rho))'> 0$, i.e. a non-rapid decrease of velocity with
density. Numerical simulation for both the individual and hydrodynamic models
with a velocity function inspired by experiment demonstrates the validity of
the theoretical results.

Investigations are carried out at temperatures, which correspond both to the
experimental conditions under which metallic hydrogen is produced on earth and
the conditions in the cores of giant planets of the solar system such as
Jupiter and Saturn. It is assumed that hydrogen is in an atomic state and all
its electrons are collectivized. Perturbation theory in the electron and proton
interaction is applied to determine the thermodynamic potentials of metallic
hydrogen. The electron subsystem is considered in the randomphase approximation
with regard to the exchange interaction and the correlation of electrons in the
local field approximation. The interproton interaction is taken into account in
the hard spheres approximation. The thermodynamic characteristics of metallic
hydrogen are calculated with regard to the zero-, second-, and thirdorder
perturbation theory terms. The third-order term proves to be rather essential
at moderately high temperatures and densities, although it is much smaller than
the second-order term. The thermodynamic potentials of metallic hydrogen are
monotonically increasing functions of density and temperature. The values of
pressure for the temperatures and pressures that are characteristic of the
conditions under which metallic hydrogen is produced on earth coincide with the
corresponding values reported by the discoverers of metallic hydrogen to a high
degree of accuracy. The temperature and density ranges are found in which there
exists a liquid phase of metallic hydrogen.

  to modeling of cognition",,"Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10106, 49-56, 2016",,,"q-bio.NC math.PR quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, especially methods
of quantum probability theory, started to be widely used in a variety of
applications outside of physics, e.g., cognition and psychology as well as
economy and finances. To distinguish such models from genuine quantum physical
models, they often called quantum-like (although often people simply speak
about, e.g., ""quantum cognition""). These novel applications generate a number
of foundational questions. Nowadays we can speak about a new science -
foundations of quantum-like modeling. At the first stage this science was
mainly about comparison of classical and quantum models, mainly in the
probabilistic setting. It was found that statistical data from cognitive
psychology violate some basic constraints posed on data by classical
probability theory (Kolmogorov, 1933); in particular, the constraints given by
the formula of total probability and Bell's type inequalities. Recently another
question attracted some attention. In spite of real success in applications,
there are no reason to believe that the quantum probability would cover
completely all problems of, e.g., cognition. May be more general probability
models have to be explored. A similar problem attracted a lot of attention in
foundations of quantum physics culminating in a series of experiments to check
Sorkin's equality for the triple-slit experiment by Weihs' group. In this note
we present a similar test in the cognitive experimental setting. Performance of
this test would either give further confirmation of the adequacy of the quantum
probability model to cognitive applications or rejection of the conventional
quantum model. Thus this note opens the door for a series of exciting
experimental tests for the quantum-like model of cognition.
