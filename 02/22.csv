us that heavy-light mesons with the same angular momentum $L$ are almost
degenerate. The estimate is given how much this degeneracy is broken in our
relativistic potential model, and it is analytically shown that expectation
values of a commutator between the lowest order Hamiltonian and ${\vec L}^{~2}$
are of the order of $1/m_Q$ with a heavy quark mass $m_Q$. It turns out that
nonrelativistic approximation of heavy quark system has a rotational symmetry
and hence degeneracy among states with the same $L$. This feature can be tested
by measuring higher orbitally and radially excited heavy-light meson spectra
for $D/D_s/B/B_s$ in LHCb and forthcoming BelleII.

onset and the intermediate, transient stages of complexation. At conditions
above the counterion-condensation threshold, the PE association process
exhibits a distinct sliding-rod-like behavior where the polymer chains approach
each other by first stretching out at a critical distance close to their
contour length, then 'shaking hand' and sliding along each other in a parallel
fashion, before eventually folding into a neutral complex. The essential part
of the PMF for highly charged PEs can be very well described by a simple theory
based on sliding charged `Debye--H\""uckel' rods with renormalized charges in
addition to an explicit entropy contribution owing to the release of condensed
counterions. Interestingly, at the onset of complex formation, the mean force
between the PE chains is found to be discontinuous, reflecting a bimodal
structural behavior that arises from the coexistence of interconnected-rod and
isolated-coil states. These two microstates of the PE complex are balanced by
subtle counterion release effects and separated by a free-energy barrier due to
unfavorable stretching entropy.

lattice interacting through an XYZ Hamiltonian, each of them coupled to an

boundaries and even its topology radically change, introducing reentrance of
the paramagnetic phase as compared to the single-site mean field where

Going further but restricting to $D=3$ dimensional de Sitter spacetime, the
quantum expectation value of the spacelike component of the induced current has
been computed in the in-vacuum state by applying an adiabatic subtraction
scheme. We find that, in the strong electric field limit, the current responds
as $E^{\frac{3}{2}}$. In the weak electric field limit the current has a linear
response in $E$ and an inverse dependence on the mass of the scalar field. In
the case of a massless scalar field, the current varies with $E^{-1}$ which
leads to a phenomenon of infrared hyperconductivity. A new relation between
infrared hyperconductivity, tachyons, and conformality is discussed, and a
scheme to avoid an infrared hyperconductivity regime is proposed. In $D$
dimension, we eventually presented some first estimates of the backreaction of
the Schwinger pairs to the gravitational field, and we find a decrease of the

[25]. This is called the area function of the Funk manifold. If the minimum is
attained at the origin then $K$ is said to be balanced. The idea comes from the
generalization of Brickell's theorem [6] for Finsler manifolds with balanced
indicatrices [25]. As a continuation of [25] we are going to investigate
analytic properties and the asymptotic behavior of the area function of a Funk
manifold. We prove that the area function is locally analytic and the area can
be arbitrary large near to the boundary of $K$. Therefore the minimum always
attained at a uniquely determined interior point of $K$. If we apply the result
to the indicatrices of a Finsler manifold point by point then the uniquely
defined minima of the area functions constitute a vector field. We prove that
it is differentiable. Therefore each indicatrix body can be translated in such
a way that the translated body is balanced and we always have an associated
Finsler manifold with balanced indicatrices. Finsler manifolds having balanced
indicatrices represent a class of Finsler spaces such that the so-called
Brickell's conjecture holds [6], see also [25].

we consider an alternative scenario, that Jupiter's core may have accumulated
in the innermost parts of the protoplanetary disk. A growing body of research
suggests that small particles (""pebbles"") continually drift inward through the
disk. If a fraction of drifting pebbles is trapped at the inner edge of the
disk a several Earth-mass core can quickly grow. Subsequently, the core may
migrate outward beyond the snow line via planet-disk interactions. Of course,
to reach the outer Solar System Jupiter's core must traverse the terrestrial
planet-forming region.
  We use N-body simulations including synthetic forces from an underlying
gaseous disk to study how the outward migration of Jupiter's core sculpts the
terrestrial zone. If the outward migration is fast (Tmig~10^4 years), the core
simply migrates past resident planetesimals and planetary embryos. However, if
its migration is slower (Tmig~10^5 years) the core removes solids from the
inner disk by shepherding objects in mean motion resonances. In many cases the
disk interior to 0.5-1 AU is cleared of embryos and most planetesimals. By
generating a mass deficit close to the Sun, the outward migration of Jupiter's
core may thus explain the absence of terrestrial planets closer than Mercury.
Jupiter's migrating core often stimulates the growth of another large
(~Earth-mass) core -- that may provide a seed for Saturn's core -- trapped in
exterior resonance. The migrating core also may transport a fraction of
terrestrial planetesimals, such as the putative parent bodies of iron
meteorites, to the asteroid belt.

a model to treat the measurement of the (TeraHertz) THz electrical current in
quantum devices is presented. The explicit interaction of a quantum system with
an external measuring apparatus is analyzed through the unambiguous notion of
the Bohmian conditional wave function, the wave function of a subsystem. It it
shown that such THz quantum measurement process can be modeled as a weak
measurement: The systems suffers a small perturbation due to the apparatus, but
the current is measured with a great uncertainty. This uncertainty implies that
a new source of noise appears at THz frequencies. Numerical (quantum Monte
Carlo) experiments are performed confirming the weak character of this
measurement. This work also indicates that at low frequencies this noise is
negligible and it can be ignored. From a classical point of view, the origin of
this noise due to the measurement at THz frequencies can be attributed to the
plasmonic effect of those electrons at the contacts (by interpreting the
contacts themselves as part of the measuring apparatus).

learning, data mining, and search with massive data at Web scale. The effective
use of random projections requires efficient coding schemes for quantizing
(real-valued) projected data into integers. In this paper, we focus on a simple
2-bit coding scheme. In particular, we develop accurate nonlinear estimators of
data similarity based on the 2-bit strategy. This work will have important
practical applications. For example, in the task of near neighbor search, a
crucial step (often called re-ranking) is to compute or estimate data
similarities once a set of candidate data points have been identified by hash
table techniques. This re-ranking step can take advantage of the proposed
coding scheme and estimator.
  As a related task, in this paper, we also study a simple uniform quantization
scheme for the purpose of building hash tables with projected data. Our
analysis shows that typically only a small number of bits are needed. For
example, when the target similarity level is high, 2 or 3 bits might be
sufficient. When the target similarity level is not so high, it is preferable
to use only 1 or 2 bits. Therefore, a 2-bit scheme appears to be overall a good
choice for the task of sublinear time approximate near neighbor search via hash
tables.
  Combining these results, we conclude that 2-bit random projections should be
recommended for approximate near neighbor search and similarity estimation.
Extensive experimental results are provided.

address this issue, we propose employing an acoustic sensor array which is
mounted on the eyeglasses frames. The signals from the array are processed by
an algorithm with the purpose of acquiring the user's desired near-filed speech
signal while suppressing noise signals originating from the environment. The
array is comprised of two AVSs which are located at the fore of the glasses'
temples. Each AVS consists of four collocated subsensors: one pressure sensor
(with an omnidirectional response) and three particle-velocity sensors (with
dipole responses) oriented in mutually orthogonal directions. The array
configuration is designed to boost the input power of the desired signal, and
to ensure that the characteristics of the noise at the different channels are
sufficiently diverse (lending towards more effective noise suppression). Since
changes in the array's position correspond to the desired speaker's movement,
the relative source-receiver position remains unchanged; hence, the need to
track fluctuations of the steering vector is avoided. Conversely, the spatial
statistics of the noise are subject to rapid and abrupt changes due to sudden
movement and rotation of the user's head. Consequently, the algorithm must be
capable of rapid adaptation. We propose an algorithm which incorporates
detection of the desired speech in the time-frequency domain, and employs this
information to adaptively update estimates of the noise statistics. Speech
detection plays a key role in ensuring the quality of the output signal. We
conduct controlled measurements of the array in noisy scenarios. The proposed
algorithm preforms favorably with respect to conventional algorithms.

assessing the effectiveness of pest biocontrol by natural enemies in
diversified agricultural landscapes including several pesticide-based
management strategies. Our approach combines a stochastic landscape model with
a spatially-explicit model of population dynamics. It enables us to analyze the
effect of the landscape composition (proportion of semi-natural habitat,
non-treated crops, slightly treated crops and conventionally treated crops) on
the effectiveness of pest biocontrol. Effectiveness is measured through
environmental and agronomical descriptors, measuring respectively the impact of
the pesticides on the environment and the average agronomic productivity of the
whole landscape taking into account losses caused by pests.
  Conclusions: The effectiveness of the pesticide, the intensity of the
treatment and the pest intrinsic growth rate are found to be the main drivers
of landscape productivity. The loss in productivity due to a reduced use of
pesticide can be partly compensated by biocontrol. However, the model suggests
that it is not possible to maintain a constant level of productivity while
reducing the use of pesticides, even with highly efficient natural enemies.
Fragmentation of the semi-natural habitats and increased crop rotation tend to
slightly enhance the effectiveness of biocontrol but have a marginal effect
compared to the predation rate by natural enemies.

increasingly specialized production function and their reach is becoming truly
global, their aptitude in managing and shaping their inter-organizational
network is a determining factor in measuring their health. Current models of
company financial health often lack variables explaining the
inter-organizational network, and as such, assume that (1) all networks are the
same and (2) the performance of partners do not impact companies. This paper
aims to be a first step in the direction of removing these assumptions.
Specifically, the impact is illustrated by examining the effects of customer
and supplier concentrations and partners' credit risk on credit-default swap
(CDS) spreads while controlling for credit risk and size. We rely upon
supply-chain data from Bloomberg that provides insight into companies'
relationships. The empirical results show that a well diversified customer
network lowers CDS spread, while having stable partners with low default
probabilities increase spreads. The latter result suggests that successful
companies do not focus on building a stable eco-system around themselves, but
instead focus on their own profit maximization at the cost of the financial
health of their suppliers' and customers'. At a more general level, the results
indicate the importance of considering the inter-organizational networks, and
highlight the value of including network variables in credit risk models.

  Our results apply to the setting where B has a low rank structure. For this
setting, we propose an efficient algorithm that accurately recovers the
underlying M by M matrix using Theta(M) samples. This result easily translates
to Theta(M) sample algorithms for learning topic models and learning hidden
Markov Models. These linear sample complexities are optimal, up to constant
factors, in an extremely strong sense: even testing basic properties of the
underlying matrix (such as whether it has rank 1 or 2) requires Omega(M)
samples. We provide an even stronger lower bound where distinguishing whether a
sequence of observations were drawn from the uniform distribution over M
observations versus being generated by an HMM with two hidden states requires
Omega(M) observations. This precludes sublinear-sample hypothesis tests for

instability mechanism, we analyse the imprints of the initial (i.e. before bar
formation) location of stars on the bulge kinematics, in particular on the
heliocentric radial velocity distribution of bulge stars. Four different
latitudes were considered: $b=-4^\circ$, $-6^\circ$, $-8^\circ$, and
$-10^\circ$, along the bulge minor axis as well as outside it, at
$l=\pm5^\circ$ and $l=\pm10^\circ$. The bulge X-shaped structure comprises
stars that formed in the disk at different locations. Stars formed in the outer
disk, beyond the end of the bar, which are part of the boxy peanut-bulge
structure may show peaks in the velocity distributions at positive and negative
heliocentric radial velocities with high absolute values that can be larger
than 100 $\rm km$ $\rm s^{-1}$, depending on the observed direction. In some
cases the structure of the velocity field is more complex and several peaks are
observed. Stars formed in the inner disk, the most numerous, contribute
predominantly to the X-shaped structure and present different kinematic
characteristics. Our results may enable us to interpret the cold high-velocity
peak observed in the APOGEE commissioning data, as well as the excess of
high-velocity stars in the near and far arms of the X-shaped structure at
$l$=$0^\circ$ and $b$=$-6^\circ$. When compared with real data, the kinematic
picture becomes more complex due to the possible presence in the observed
samples of classical bulge and/or thick disk stars. Overall, our results point
to the existence of complex patterns and structures in the bulge velocity
fields, which are generated by the bar. This suggests that caution should be
used when interpreting the bulge kinematics: the presence of substructures,
peaks and clumps in the velocity fields is not necessarily a sign of past
accretion events.

binding profiling have stimulated systematic studies of the hierarchical
organization of human gene regulatory network and DNA-binding specificity of
TFs, shedding light on combinatorial gene regulation. We show here that these
data also enable a systematic annotation of the biological functions and
functional diversity of TFs. We compiled a human gene regulatory network for
384 TFs covering the 146,096 TF-target gene relationships, extracted from over
850 ChIP-seq experiments as well as the literature. By integrating this network
of TF-TF and TF-target gene relationships with 3,715 functional concepts from
six sources of gene function annotations, we obtained over 9,000 confident
functional annotations for 279 TFs. We observe extensive connectivity between
transcription factors and Mendelian diseases, GWAS phenotypes, and
pharmacogenetic pathways. Further, we show that transcription factors link
apparently unrelated functions, even when the two functions do not share common
genes. Finally, we analyze the pleiotropic functions of TFs and suggest that
increased number of upstream regulators contributes to the functional
pleiotropy of TFs. Our computational approach is complementary to focused
experimental studies on TF functions, and the resulting knowledge can guide
experimental design for discovering the unknown roles of TFs in human disease
and drug response.

the flat-spectrum radio-quasar class (FSRQ) is characterized by strong external
radiation fields, emission of broad optical lines, and dust tori. The BL Lac
class (from the name of one of its members, BL Lacertae) corresponds to weaker
advection-dominated flows with gamma-ray spectra dominated by the inverse
Compton effect on synchrotron photons. This paradigm has been very successful
for modeling the broadband spectral energy distributions of blazars. However,
many fundamental issues remain, including the role of hadronic processes and
the rapid variability of those BL Lac objects whose synchrotron spectrum peaks

post-randomization complications. After using principal stratification to
define causal effects of interest, researchers are increasingly turning to
finite mixture models to estimate these quantities. Unfortunately, standard
estimators of mixture parameters, like the MLE, are known to exhibit
pathological behavior. We study this behavior in a simple but fundamental
example, a two-component Gaussian mixture model in which only the component
means and variances are unknown, and focus on the setting in which the
components are weakly separated. In this case, we show that the asymptotic
convergence rate of the MLE is quite poor, such as $O(n^{-1/6})$ or even
$O(n^{-1/8})$. We then demonstrate via theoretical arguments as well as
extensive simulations that, in finite samples, the MLE behaves like a threshold
estimator, in the sense that the MLE can give strong evidence that the means
are equal when the truth is otherwise. We also explore the behavior of the MLE
when the MLE is non-zero, showing that it is difficult to estimate both the
sign and magnitude of the means in this case. We provide diagnostics for all of
these pathologies and apply these ideas to re-analyzing two randomized
evaluations of job training programs, JOBS II and Job Corps. Our results
suggest that the corresponding maximum likelihood estimates should be
interpreted with caution in these cases.

chaotic, quasiperiodic, and periodic behaviors in segmented regions of the
phase space. While there is no evidence of global chaos in either the Coulombic
or the gravitational system, the former exhibits a transition from a completely
non-chaotic phase space at low energies to a mixed behavior. Gradual yet
striking transitions from mild to intense chaos are indicated with changing
energy, a behavior that differentiates the spatially periodic systems studied
in this paper from the well-understood free-boundary versions of the 3-body
problem. Our treatment of the 3-body systems is the first one of its kind and
opens avenues for analysis of the dynamical properties exhibited by spatially

requires deploying large antenna arrays at both the basestations and mobile

guarantee sufficient beamforming gains. Prior work on coverage and rate of
mmWave cellular networks focused mainly on the case when basestations and
mobile users beamfomring vectors are perfectly designed for maximum beamforming
gains. Designing beamforming/combining vectors, though, requires training which
may impact both the SINR coverage and rate of mmWave cellular systems. This
paper characterizes and evaluates the performance of mmWave cellular networks
while accounting for the beam training/association overhead. First, a model for
the initial beam association is developed based on beam sweeping and downlink
control pilot reuse. To incorporate the impact of beam training into system
performance, a new metric, called the effective reliable rate, is defined and
adopted. Using stochastic geometry, the effective reliable rate of mmWave
cellular networks is derived for two special cases: with near-orthogonal
control pilots and with full pilot reuse. Analytical and simulation results
provide insights into the answers of three important questions: (i) What is the
impact of beam association on mmWave network performance? (ii) Should
orthogonal or reused control pilots be employed in the initial beam association
phase? (iii) Should exhaustive or hierarchical search be adopted for the beam
training phase? The results show that unless the employed beams are very wide
or the system coherence block length is very small, exhaustive search with full
pilot reuse is nearly as good as perfect beam alignment.

call nonparametric modal regression, to investigate the relationship among
interested variables based on estimating the mode of the conditional density of
a response variable Y given predictors X. The nonparametric modal regression is
distinguished from the conventional nonparametric regression in that, instead
of the conditional average or median, it uses the ""most likely"" conditional
values to measures the center. Better prediction performance and robustness are
two important characteristics of nonparametric modal regression compared to
traditional nonparametric mean regression and nonparametric median regression.
We propose to use local polynomial regression to estimate the nonparametric
modal regression. The asymptotic properties of the resulting estimator are
investigated. To broaden the applicability of the nonparametric modal
regression to high dimensional data or functional/longitudinal data, we further
develop a nonparametric varying coefficient modal regression. A Monte Carlo
simulation study and an analysis of health care expenditure data demonstrate
some superior performance of the proposed nonparametric modal regression model
to the traditional nonparametric mean regression and nonparametric median

induces algebra maps from (I^i)^j to I^{ij}, fitting nicely with previously
studied structure.

around the NCP down to ~ 0.1 Jy. Our source counts are compared, and also
exhibit a good agreement, with deep low-frequency observations made recently
with the GMRT and MWA. In particular, for fainter radio sources below ~ 1 Jy,
we find a flattening trend of source counts towards lower frequencies. While
the thermal noise (~0.4 mJy) is well controlled to below the confusion limit,
the dynamical range (~10^4) and sensitivity of current 21CMA imaging is largely
limited by calibration and deconvolution errors, especially the grating lobes
of very bright sources, such as 3C061.1, in the NCP field which result from the
regular spacings of the 21CMA. We note that particular attention should be paid

but how far they are is largely unknown due to lack of any associations with
known sources. In this paper, we propose that the cumulative TeV gamma-ray
emission accompanying the production of neutrinos can be used to constrain the
distance of these neutrino sources, since the opacity of TeV gamma rays due to
absorption by the extragalactic background light (EBL) depends on the distance
that these TeV gamma rays have travelled. As the diffuse extragalactic TeV
background measured by \emph{Fermi} is much weaker than the expected cumulative
flux associated with IceCube neutrinos, the majority of IceCube neutrinos, if
their sources are transparent to TeV gamma rays, must come from distances
larger than the horizon of TeV gamma rays. We find that above 80\% of the
IceCube neutrinos should come from sources at redshift $z>0.5$. Thus, the
chance for finding nearby sources correlated with IceCube neutrinos would be
small. We also find that, to explain the flux of neutrinos under the TeV
gamma-ray emission constraint, the redshift evolution of neutrino source
density must be at least as fast as the the cosmic star-formation rate.

a hierarchical diamond lattice in which i.i.d. random variables are attached to
the lattice bonds. Our focus is on scaling schemes in which a size parameter
$n$, counting the number of hierarchical layers of the system, becomes large as
the inverse temperature $\beta$ vanishes. When $\beta$ has the form
$\widehat{\beta}/\sqrt{n}$ for a parameter $\widehat{\beta}>0$, we show that
there is a cutoff value $0 < \kappa < \infty$ such that as $n \to \infty$ the
variance of the normalized partition function tends to zero for
$\widehat{\beta}\leq \kappa $ and grows without bound for $\widehat{\beta} >
\kappa $. We obtain a more refined description of the border between these two
regimes by setting the inverse temperature to $\kappa/\sqrt{n} + \alpha_n$
where $0 < \alpha_n \ll 1/\sqrt{n}$ and analyzing the asymptotic behavior of
the variance. We show that when $\alpha_n = \alpha (\log n-\log \log
n)/n^{3/2}$ (with a small modification to deal with non-zero third moment)
there is a similar cutoff value $\eta$ for the parameter $\alpha$ such that
when $\alpha < \eta$ the variance goes to zero and grows without bound when
$\alpha > \eta$. Extending the analysis yet again by probing around the inverse
temperature $\kappa/\sqrt{n} + \eta (\log n-\log \log n)/n^{3/2}$ we find an
infinite sequence of nested critical points for the variance behavior of the
normalized partition function. In the subcritical cases $\widehat{\beta} \leq
\kappa$ and $\alpha \leq \eta$ this analysis is extended to a central limit
theorem result for the fluctuations of the normalized partition function.

information by its spiking activity states. Typically observed states, i.e.,
codewords, occupy only a limited portion of the state space due to constraints
imposed by network interactions. Geometrical organization of codewords in the
state space, critical for neural information processing, is poorly understood
due to its high dimensionality. Here, we explore the organization of neural
codewords using retinal data by computing the entropy of codewords as a
function of Hamming distance from a particular reference codeword.
Specifically, we report that the retinal codewords in the state space are
divided into multiple distinct clusters separated by entropy-gaps, and that
this structure is shared with well-known associative memory networks in a
recallable phase. Our analysis also elucidates a special nature of the
all-silent state. The all-silent state is surrounded by the densest cluster of
codewords and located within a reachable distance from most codewords. This
codeword-space structure quantitatively predicts typical deviation of a
state-trajectory from its initial state. Altogether, our findings reveal a
non-trivial heterogeneous structure of the codeword-space that shapes
information representation in a biological network.

freedom known as valley, which characterizes the degenerate energy minima in
momentum space. The recent success in optical pumping of valley polarization in
2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has greatly promoted the concept of
valley-based informatics and electronics. However, between the demonstrated
valley polarization of transient electron-hole pair excitations and practical
valleytronic operations, there exist obvious gaps to fill, among which is the
valley pump of long-lived charge carriers. Here we discover that the quested
valley pump of electrons or holes can be realized simply by scattering at the
ubiquitous nonmagnetic disorders, not relying on any specific material
property. The mechanism is rooted in the nature of valley as a momentum space
index: the intervalley backscattering in general has valley contrasted rate due
to the distinct momentum transfers, causing a net transfer of population from
one valley to another. As examples, we numerically demonstrate the sizable
valley pump effects driven by charge current in nanoribbons of monolayer TMDs,
where the spin-orbit scattering by non-magnetic disorders also realizes spin
pump for the spin-valley locked holes. Our finding points to an unexpected new
opportunity towards valley-spintronics, turning disorders from a deleterious

electronic module through PXIe dedicated differential star bus. With the help
of this topology, each tree node can fan out up to 20 clocks with 3U size. Test
result shows the clock jitter is less than 20ps, which can meet the requirement

nearby trajectories in phase space, hyperchaos is defined as a state where
there is divergence or stretching in at least two directions during the
evolution of the system. Hence the detection and characterization of a
hyperchaotic attractor is usually done using the spectrum of Lyapunov Exponents
(LEs) that measure this rate of divergence along each direction. Though
hyperchaos arise in different dynamical situations and find several practical
applications, a proper understanding of the geometric structure of a
hyperchaotic attractor still remains an unsolved problem. In this paper, we
present strong numerical evidence to suggest that the geometric structure of a
hyperchaotic attractor can be characterized using a multifractal spectrum with
two superimposed components. In other words, apart from developing an extra
positive LE, there is also a structural change as a chaotic attractor makes a
transition to the hyperchaotic phase and the attractor changes from a simple
multifractal to a dual multifractal, equivalent to two inter-mingled
multifractals. We argue that a cross-over behavior in the scaling region for
computing the correlation dimension is a manifestation of such a structure. In
order to support this claim, we present an illustrative example of a
synthetically generated set of points in the unit interval (a Cantor set with a
variable iteration scheme) displaying dual multifractal spectrum. Our results
are also used to develop a general scheme to generate both hyperchaotic as well
as high dimensional chaotic attractors by coupling two low dimensional chaotic
attractors and tuning a time scale parameter.

equivalent potential games, and prove decomposition theorems involving these
classes of games. We say that two games are ""strategically equivalent"" if, for
every player, the payoff differences between two strategies (holding other
players' strategies fixed) are identical. A zero-sum equivalent game is a game
that is strategically equivalent to a zero-sum game; a zero-sum equivalent
potential game is a zero-sum equivalent game that is strategically equivalent
to a common interest game. We also call a game ""normalized"" if the sum of one
player's payoffs, given the other players' strategies, is always zero. We show
that any normal form game can be uniquely decomposed into either (i) a zero-sum
equivalent game and a normalized common interest game, or (ii) a zero-sum
equivalent potential game, a normalized zero-sum game, and a normalized common
interest game, each with distinctive equilibrium properties. For example, we
show that two-player zero-sum equivalent games with finite strategy sets
generically have a unique Nash equilibrium and that two-player zero-sum
equivalent potential games with finite strategy sets generically have a
strictly dominant Nash equilibrium.

the total dissipation rate in the ocean surface wave boundary layer of
different breaking wave scales, from large-scale whitecaps to micro-breakers.
Based on their measurements of geometric/kinematic properties of breaking waves
for a wide range of wave ages, they inferred the dissipation rates from
breaking as a function of scale. These results were compared with their
complementary measurements of the total dissipation rate in the underlying wave
boundary layer. They reported that the total depth-integrated dissipation rate
in the water column agreed well with dissipation rate from breaking waves for
young to very old wind seas. They also reported high observed levels of
dissipation rate very near the sea surface. They concluded that this showed a
large fraction of the total dissipation rate was due to non-air entraining
micro-breakers and very small whitecaps. Because of its fundamental importance,
both physically and for accurate air-sea interaction modeling, we assess the
validity of these conclusions. Our analysis of their data shows that the
microbreakers and small whitecaps do not make a significant contribution to the
total turbulent dissipation rate in the wave boundary layer.

the ability to locate and track sounds, as well as to separate simultaneous
sound sources and recognising simultaneous speech. We demonstrate that it is
possible to implement these capabilities using an array of microphones, without
trying to imitate the human auditory system. The sound source localisation and
tracking algorithm uses a steered beamformer to locate sources, which are then
tracked using a multi-source particle filter. Separation of simultaneous sound
sources is achieved using a variant of the Geometric Source Separation (GSS)
algorithm, combined with a multi-source post-filter that further reduces noise,
interference and reverberation. Speech recognition is performed on separated
sources, either directly or by using Missing Feature Theory (MFT) to estimate
the reliability of the speech features.
  The results obtained show that it is possible to track up to four
simultaneous sound sources, even in noisy and reverberant environments.
Real-time control of the robot following a sound source is also demonstrated.
The sound source separation approach we propose is able to achieve a 13.7 dB
improvement in signal-to-noise ratio compared to a single microphone when three
speakers are present. In these conditions, the system demonstrates more than
80% accuracy on digit recognition, higher than most human listeners could
obtain in our small case study when recognising only one of these sources. All
these new capabilities will allow humans to interact more naturally with a
mobile robot in real life settings.

features to compact binary codes with similarity preserving in the Hamming

retrieval. We propose a column generation based binary code learning framework
for data-dependent hash function learning. Given a set of triplets that encode
the pairwise similarity comparison information, our column generation based
method learns hash functions that preserve the relative comparison relations
within the large-margin learning framework. Our method iteratively learns the
best hash functions during the column generation procedure. Existing hashing
methods optimize over simple objectives such as the reconstruction error or
graph Laplacian related loss functions, instead of the performance evaluation
criteria of interest---multivariate performance measures such as the AUC and
NDCG. Our column generation based method can be further generalized from the
triplet loss to a general structured learning based framework that allows one
to directly optimize multivariate performance measures. For optimizing general
ranking measures, the resulting optimization problem can involve exponentially
or infinitely many variables and constraints, which is more challenging than
standard structured output learning. We use a combination of column generation
and cutting-plane techniques to solve the optimization problem. To speed-up the
training we further explore stage-wise training and propose to use a simplified
NDCG loss for efficient inference. We demonstrate the generality of our method
by applying it to ranking prediction and image retrieval, and show that it
outperforms a few state-of-the-art hashing methods.

comparison, we compare and contrast the impact of baryonic physics with a
single massive galaxy cluster, run with 11 state-of-the-art codes, spanning
adaptive mesh, moving mesh, classic and modern SPH approaches. For each code
represented we have a dark matter only (DM) and non-radiative (NR) version of
the cluster, as well as a full physics (FP) version for a subset of the codes.
We compare both radial mass and kinematic profiles, as well as global measures
of the cluster (e.g. concentration, spin, shape), in the NR and FP runs with
that in the DM runs. Our analysis reveals good consistency (<= 20%) between
global properties of the cluster predicted by different codes when integrated
quantities are measured within the virial radius R200. However, we see larger
differences for quantities within R2500, especially in the FP runs. The radial
profiles reveal a diversity, especially in the cluster centre, between the NR
runs, which can be understood straightforwardly from the division of codes into
classic SPH and non-classic SPH (including the modern SPH, adaptive and moving
mesh codes); and between the FP runs, which can also be understood broadly from
the division of codes into those that include AGN feedback and those that do
not. The variation with respect to the median is much larger in the FP runs
with different baryonic physics prescriptions than in the NR runs with
different hydrodynamics solvers.

contributions to the out-of-plane spin-transfer torque parameter $\beta$ in
ballistic Ni domain walls (DWs). For short DWs, the nonadiabatic reflection of
conduction electrons caused by the rapid spatial variation of the exchange
potential results in an out-of-plane torque that increases rapidly with
decreasing DW length. For long DWs, the Fermi level conduction channel
anisotropy that gives rise to an intrinsic DW resistance in the presence of SOC

counterintuitive divergence of $\beta$ in the long DW limit, we use the
""nonequilibrium magnetization"" formalism to examine the spatially resolved
spin-transfer torque. The SOC-induced out-of-plane torque in ballistic DWs is
found to be quantitatively consistent with the values obtained using the

from the massive collapsars. It is believed that the central engine of
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is a neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) around a
rotating stellar-mass black hole (BH). The neutrino annihilation above the NDAF
is a feasible mechanism to power GRB. In this work, we analyse the
distributions of the isotropic gamma-ray radiated energy and jet kinetic energy
of 48 LGRBs. According to the NDAF and fireball models, we estimate the mean
accreted masses of LGRBs in our sample to investigate whether the NDAFs can
power LGRBs with the reasonable BH parameters and conversion efficiency of
neutrino annihilation. The results indicate that most of the values of the
accreted masses are less than $5~M_\odot$ for the extreme Kerr BHs and high
conversion efficiency. It suggests that the NDAFs may be suitable for most of
LGRBs except for some extremely high energy sources.

Cross-modal hashing improves the quality of hash coding by exploiting semantic

first transform data into low-dimensional feature vectors, and then generate
binary codes by another separate quantization step. However, suboptimal hash
codes may be generated since the quantization error is not explicitly minimized
and the feature representation is not jointly optimized with the binary codes.
This paper presents a Correlation Hashing Network (CHN) approach to cross-modal
hashing, which jointly learns good data representation tailored to hash coding

architecture that constitutes a convolutional neural network for learning good
image representations, a multilayer perception for learning good text

structured max-margin loss that integrates all things together to enable
learning similarity-preserving and high-quality hash codes. Extensive empirical

partially dynamic versions of three classic problems in graph theory. Based on
popular conjectures we show that:
  -- No algorithm with amortized update time $O(n^{1-\varepsilon})$ exists for
incremental or decremental maximum cardinality bipartite matching. This
significantly improves on the $O(m^{1/2-\varepsilon})$ bound for sparse graphs
of Henzinger et al. [STOC'15] and $O(n^{1/3-\varepsilon})$ bound of Kopelowitz,
Pettie and Porat. Our linear bound also appears more natural. In addition, the
result we present separates the node-addition model from the edge insertion
model, as an algorithm with total update time $O(m\sqrt{n})$ exists for the
former by Bosek et al. [FOCS'14].

powerful tool with which we may constrain modified theories of gravity (MG) on
cosmological scales. Future deep, wide-field WL surveys will provide an
unprecedented opportunity to constrain deviations from General Relativity (GR).
Employing a three-dimensional (3D) analysis based on the spherical
Fourier-Bessel (sFB) expansion, we investigate the extent to which MG theories
will be constrained by a typical 3D WL survey configuration including noise
from the intrinsic ellipticity distribution $\sigma_{\epsilon}$ of source
galaxies. Here we focus on two classes of screened theories of gravity: i)
$f(R)$ chameleon models and ii) environmentally dependent dilaton models. We
use one-loop perturbation theory combined with halo models in order to
accurately model the evolution of matter power-spectrum with redshift in these
theories. Using a Fisher information matrix based approach, we show that for an
all-sky spectroscopic survey, the parameter $f_{R_0}$ can be constrained in the
range $f_{R_0}< 5\times 10^{-6}(9\times 10^{-6})$ for $n=1(2)$ with a 3$\sigma$
confidence level. This can be achieved by using relatively low order angular
harmonics $\ell<100$. Including higher order harmonics $\ell>100$ can further
tighten the constraints, making them comparable to current solar-system
constraints. We also employ a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in order to
study the parameter degeneracies in the MG parameters. Our results can
trivially be extended to other MG theories, such as the K-mouflage models. The
confusion from intrinsic ellipticity correlation and modification of the matter
power-spectrum at small scale due to feedback mechanisms is briefly discussed.

  Circumstellar Discs","7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph.EP astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Circumstellar discs are thought to be self-gravitating at very early times.
If the disc is relatively cool, extended and accreting sufficiently rapidly, it
can fragment into bound objects of order a few Jupiter masses and upwards.
Given that the fragment's initial angular momentum is non-zero, and it will
continue to accrete angular momentum from the surrounding circumstellar disc,
we should expect that the fragment will also possess a relatively massive disc
at early times. Therefore, we can ask: is disc fragmentation a hierarchical
process? Or, can a disc fragment go on to produce its own self-gravitating
circumfragmentary disc that produces daughter fragments?
  We investigate this using a set of nested 1D self-gravitating disc models. We
calculate the radial structure of a marginally stable, self-gravitating
circumstellar disc, and compute its propensity to fragmentation. We use this
data to construct the local fragment properties at this radius. For each
circumstellar disc model that results in fragmentation, we then compute a
marginally stable self-gravitating circumfragmentary disc model.
  In general, the circumfragmentary discs are geometrically thick and truncated
inside the Hill radius, and are hence stable against daughter fragmentation.
The typical steady-state accretion rate is between 0.1 and 10 percent of the
local circumstellar disc accretion rate. The lifetime of the circumfragmentary
discs' self-gravitating phase is somewhat less than 0.1 Myr, quite comparable
with that of the circumstellar disc. We should therefore expect that disc
fragments will not produce satellites via gravitational instability, but
equally the self-gravitating phase of circumfragmentary discs is likely to
affect the properties of satellites subsequently formed via core accretion.

striking remark is that all these different dynamical approaches, each of them
possibly relevant in some specific regimes, lead to the same kind of final jet
structures. Is it then possible to have a more general explanation of why all
these different dynamical regimes, from fully turbulent flows to gentle
quasilinear regime, consistently lead to the same jet attractors ? Equilibrium
statistical mechanics provides an answer to this general question. Here we we
present the salient features of this theory and review applications of this

beta plane or a sphere are usually zonal or quasi-zonal, and that increasing
the energy leads to bifurcations breaking the zonal symmetry.

and 5.0 mEq/L in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). These
guidelines are based on recent studies that found significant associations
between crossing of absolute potassium limits (by in-hospital mean or by
min/max values) and mortality. This paper investigates a different approach: we
hypothesized that a change in the potassium level may be a harbinger of short
survivability, rather than crossing of absolute boundaries. Our objectives
were: (1) to examine if a ""change in mean"" indicator has the ability to
distinguish between survivors and non-survivors of MI hospitalization, and if
so, (2) to formulate a framework for detecting life-threatening changes in
potassium level of patients hospitalized with MI. The study included 195
patients who were hospitalized for MI from 2002 to 2014, with at least 40
potassium measurements (i.e., severely ill). In a retrospective analysis we
found evidence that the ""change in mean"" criterion significantly discriminated
between survivors and non-survivors. A threshold for raising an alarm was
specified by plotting an ROC curve and choosing the value that yields the best
combination of sensitivity and specificity. In this case, the method detected
~80% of the patients that eventually died, while wrongly alerting for only ~40%
of the survivors. The proposed approach is not intended for replacing the
absolute-level protocols but to add valuable knowledge to cardiologists.

sensing time and transmission power. In general, this problem is known to be NP
hard. For optimization over these two decision variables, we use an exhaustive

policy for longer horizons. For given values of the decision variables, the
problem simplifies into a joint optimization on SU \textit{transmission power}

for each planet, we naturally probe a wide phase space in planet radius,
gravity, orbital period, and equilibrium temperature. First, we show that our
model ""grid"" recovers trends shown in traditional parametric studies of hot
Jupiters, particularly equatorial superrotation and increased day-night
temperature contrast with increasing equilibrium temperature. We show how
spatial temperature variations, particularly between the dayside and nightside
and west and east terminators, can vary by hundreds of K, which could imply
large variations in Na, K, CO and CH4 abundances in those regions. These
chemical variations can be large enough to be observed in transmission with
high-resolution spectrographs, such as ESPRESSO on VLT, METIS on the E-ELT, or
with MIRI and NIRSpec aboard JWST. We also compare theoretical emission spectra
generated from our models to available Spitzer eclipse depths for each planet,
and find that the outputs from our solar-metallicity, cloud-free models
generally provide a good match to many of the datasets, even without additional
model tuning. Although these models are cloud-free, we can use their results to
understand the chemistry and dynamics that drive cloud formation in their
atmospheres.

estimate a hidden property of the environment through the observation of social
interactions. Previous work on collective sensing shows that gregarious
individuals obtain an evolutionary advantage by exploiting collective sensing
when competing against solitary individuals. This work addresses the question
of whether collective sensing allows for the emergence of groups from a
population of individuals without predetermined behaviors. It is assumed that
group membership does not lessen competition on the limited resources in the
environment, e.g. groups do not improve foraging efficiency. Experiments are
run in an agent-based evolutionary model of a foraging task, where the fitness
of the agents depends on their foraging strategy. The foraging strategy of
agents is determined by a neural network, which does not require explicit
modeling of the environment and of the interactions between agents. Experiments
demonstrate that gregarious behavior is not the evolutionary-fittest strategy
if resources are abundant, thus invalidating previous findings in a specific
region of the parameter space. In other words, resource scarcity makes
gregarious behavior so valuable as to make up for the increased competition
over the few available resources. Furthermore, it is shown that a population of
solitary agents can evolve gregarious behavior in response to a sudden scarcity
of resources, thus individuating a possible mechanism that leads to gregarious
behavior in nature. The evolutionary process operates on the whole parameter
space of the neural networks, hence these behaviors are selected among an
unconstrained set of behavioral models.

cannot be used when comparing with real experimental data. We find that the
dipole formula is valid only in very forward/backward rapidity regions ($|y| >$

calculations of some differential cross sections for low-mass dilepton
production by the LHCb and ATLAS collaborations. In distinction to most of

although the impact of interference structure functions is rather small for the
relevant experimental cuts. We find that both side contributions ($g + q/\bar
q$ and $q/\bar q + g$) have to be included even for the LHCb rapidity coverage
which is in contradiction with what is usually done in the dipole approach. We
present results for different unintegrated gluon distributions from the

D",,"10.1142/S0218271816500607",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A Hubble diagram (HD) has recently been constructed in the redshift range
0<z<6.5 using a non-linear relation between the ultraviolet and X-ray
luminosities of QSOs. The Type Ia SN HD has already provided a high-precision
test of cosmological models, but the fact that the QSO distribution extends
well beyond the supernova range (z<1.8), in principle provides us with an
important complementary diagnostic whose significantly greater leverage in z
can impose tighter constraints on the distance versus redshift relationship. In
this paper, we therefore perform an independent test of nine different
cosmological models, among which six are expanding, while three are static.
Many of these are disfavoured by other kinds of observations (including the
aforementioned Type Ia SNe). We wish to examine whether the QSO HD confirms or
rejects these earlier conclusions. We find that four of these models
(Einstein-de Sitter, the Milne universe, the Static Universe with simple tired
light and the Static universe with plasma tired light) are excluded at the >99%
C.L. The Quasi-Steady State Model is excluded at >95% C.L. The remaining four
models (Lambda-CDM/wCDM, the R_h=ct Universe, the Friedmann open universe and a
Static universe with a linear Hubble law) all pass the test. However, only
Lambda-CDM/wCDM and $R_{\rm h}=ct$ also pass the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) test.
The optimized parameters in Lambda-CDM/wCDM are Omega_m=0.20^{+0.24}_{-0.20}
and w_{de}=-1.2^{+1.6}_{-infinity} (the dark-energy equation-of-state).
Combined with the AP test, these values become Omega_m=0.38^{+0.20}_{-0.19} and
w_{de}=-0.28^{+0.52}_{-0.40}. But whereas this optimization of parameters in
Lambda-CDM/wCDM creates some tension with their concordance values, the $R_{\rm
h}=ct$ Universe has the advantage of fitting the QSO and AP data without any
free parameters.

construct MIPs with the same solutions whose objective functions are convex.
Specifically, we characterize the tightest convex extension of the objective

boundary has two conical singularities. Their regularised holographic entropy
is calculated with all divergent as well as finite terms. The coefficient of
the squared logarithmic divergence, also in such a case with internally curved
boundary, agrees with that calculated in the literature for infinite circular
cones with their internally flat boundary. For the otherwise conformally
invariant coefficient of the ordinary logarithmic divergence an anomaly under
exceptional conformal transformations is observed.
  The construction of minimal submanifolds, needed for the entanglement entropy
of cones, requires fine-tuning of Cauchy data. Perturbations of such
fine-tuning leads to solutions relevant for hollow cones. The divergent parts
for the entanglement entropy of hollow cones are calculated. Increasing the
difference between the opening angles of their outer and inner boundary, one
finds a transition between connected solutions for small differences to
disconnected solutions for larger ones.

collective one-phonon states are of great interest in nuclear structure
physics. One possibility to generate low-lying $E1$ excitations is the coupling
of quadrupole and octupole phonons.
  Purpose: In this work, the $\gamma$-decay behavior of candidates for the
$(2_1^+\otimes 3_1^-)_{1^-}$ state in the doubly-magic nucleus $^{40}$Ca and in
the heavier and semi-magic nucleus $^{140}$Ce is investigated.
  Methods: $(\vec{\gamma},\gamma')$ experiments have been carried out at the
High Intensity $\gamma$-ray Source (HI${\gamma}$S) facility in combination with
the high-efficiency $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy setup $\gamma^3$ consisting of
HPGe and LaBr$_3$ detectors. The setup enables the acquisition of
$\gamma$-$\gamma$ coincidence data and, hence, the detection of direct decay
paths.
  Results: In addition to the known ground-state decays, for $^{40}$Ca the
decay into the $3^-_1$ state was observed, while for $^{140}$Ce the direct
decays into the $2^+_1$ and the $0^+_2$ state were detected. The experimentally
deduced transition strengths and excitation energies are compared to
theoretical calculations in the framework of EDF theory plus QPM approach and
systematically analyzed for $N=82$ isotones. In addition, negative parities for
two $J=1$ states in $^{44}$Ca were deduced simultaneously.
  Conclusions: The experimental findings together with the theoretical
calculations support the two-phonon character of the $1^-_1$ excitation in the
light-to-medium-mass nucleus $^{40}$Ca as well as in the stable even-even
$N=82$ nuclei.

strong spiral flows generated by the so-called low $T/|W|$ instability enhance
the energy transport from the proto-neutron star (PNS) to the gain region,

strongly in the direction perpendicular to the rotational axis, which is

to analyze Fermi-LAT data. Our study does confirm the existence of such an
extra component in the diffuse \gamma-ray emission at GeV energies. Based on a
detailed morphological analysis, a spatial template that fits the data best was
generated and adopted. Using this template, the energy distribution of
\gamma-rays was derived in the 0.3-30 GeV energy interval. The spectrum
appeared to have less distinct ('bump'-like) structure than previous reported.
We argue that the morphology of this radiation component has a bipolar rather
than a spherically symmetric structure as has been assumed a priori in previous
studies. This finding excludes the associations of the GeV excess with Dark
Matter. We briefly discuss the radiation mechanisms and possible source
populations that could be responsible for this new component of diffuse gamma
radiation.

stochastic control problem under regime switching that is motivated by the
optimal irreversible extraction problem of an exhaustible commodity. A company
extracts a natural resource from a reserve with finite capacity, and sells it
in the market at a spot price that evolves according to a Brownian motion with
volatility modulated by a two-state Markov chain. In this setting, the company
aims at finding the extraction rule that maximizes its expected discounted cash
flow, net of the costs of extraction and maintenance of the reserve. We provide
expressions both for the value function and for the optimal control. On the one
hand, if the running cost for the maintenance of the reserve is a convex
function of the reserve level, the optimal extraction rule prescribes a
Skorokhod reflection of the (optimally) controlled state process at a certain
state and price dependent threshold. On the other hand, in presence of a
concave running cost function it is optimal to instantaneously deplete the
reserve at the time at which the commodity's price exceeds an endogenously
determined critical level. In both cases, the threshold triggering the optimal
control is given in terms of the optimal stopping boundary of an auxiliary
family of perpetual optimal selling problems with regime switching.

high velocities by field-like N\'{e}el spin-orbit torques. Such torques arise
from current-induced local fields that alternate their orientation on each
sub-lattice of the antiferromagnet and whose orientation depend primarily on
the current direction, giving them their field-like character. The domain-wall
velocities that can be achieved by this mechanism are two orders of magnitude
greater than the ones in ferromagnets. This arises from the efficiency of the
staggered spin-orbit fields to couple to the order parameter and from the
exchange-enhanced phenomena in antiferromagnetic texture dynamics, which leads
to a low domain-wall effective mass and the absence of a Walker break-down
limit. In addition, because of its nature, the staggered spin-orbit field can
lift the degeneracy between two 180$^\circ$ rotated states in a collinear
antiferromagnet and provides a force that can move such walls and control the
switching of the states.

comprehensive foundation of this form of rewriting. We interpret diagrams
combinatorially as typed hypergraphs and establish the precise correspondence

two-dimensional (2D) Dirac-like Hamiltonian. It was shown that the Dirac magnon
Hamiltonian preserves time-reversal symmetry defined with the sublattice pseudo
spins and the Dirac points are robust against magnon-magnon interactions. The
Dirac points also occur at nonzero energy. In this paper, we propose a simple
realization of nontrivial topology (magnon edge states) in this system. We show
that the Dirac points are gapped when the inversion symmetry of the lattice is
broken by introducing a next-nearest neighbour Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)
interaction. Thus, the system realizes magnon edge states similar to Haldane
model for quantum anomalous Hall effect in electronic systems. However, in
contrast to electronic spin current where dissipation can be very large due to
Ohmic heating, noninteracting topological magnons can propagate for long time
without dissipation as magnons are uncharged particles. We observe the same
magnon edge states for the XY model on the honeycomb lattice. Remarkably, in
this case the model maps to interacting hardcore bosons on the honeycomb
lattice. Quantum magnetic systems with nontrivial magnon edge states are called
topological magnon insulators. They have been studied theoretically on the
kagome lattice and recently observed experimentally on the kagome magnet

  Part 1 deals with the case A (see arXiv:1304.5720). Part 2 concerns the case
D. We show that the category of representation of D_n contains a full

of type D_{n-1} such that the remaining indecomposable representations are

approach allows us to infer the underlying model parameters from experimental
observation, rather than to predict the observations from the model parameters.
The IP was formulated for the numerical generalization of the semi-empirical
mass formula of BW. It was solved in step by step way based on the AME2012
nuclear database. The established parametrization describes the measured
nuclear masses of 2564 isotopes with a maximum deviation less than 2.6 MeV,
starting from the number of protons and number of neutrons equal to 1. The set
of parameters $\{a_{i}\}$, $i=1,\dots, {\mathcal{N}}_{\rm{param}}$ of our fit
represent the solution of an overdetermined system of nonlinear equations,
which represent equalities between the binding energy
$E_{B,j}^{\rm{Expt}}(A,Z)$ and its model $E_{B,j}^{\rm{Th}}(A,Z,\{a_{i}\})$,
where $j$ is the index of the given isotope. The solution of the overdetermined
system of nonlinear equations has been obtained with the help of the
Aleksandrov's auto-regularization method of Gauss-Newton(GN) type for ill-posed
problems. The efficiency of the above methods was checked by comparing relevant
results with the results obtained independently. The explicit form of unknown
functions was discovered in a step-by-step way using the modified least
$\chi^{2}$ procedure, that realized in the algorithms which were developed by
Aleksandrov to solve nonlinear systems of equations via the GN method, lets us
to choose between two functions with same $\chi^{2}$ the better one. In the
obtained generalized model the corrections to the binding energy depend on nine

equipped with Riemannian metrics. In this setting, we require that every edge
is drawn as a shortest path between its two endpoints and we call an embedding
with this property a shortest path embedding. The main question addressed in
this paper is whether given a closed surface S, there exists a Riemannian
metric for which every topologically embeddable graph admits a shortest path
embedding. This question is also motivated by various problems regarding
crossing numbers on surfaces.
  We observe that the round metrics on the sphere and the projective plane have
this property. We provide flat metrics on the torus and the Klein bottle which
also have this property.
  Then we show that for the unit square flat metric on the Klein bottle there
exists a graph without shortest path embeddings. We show, moreover, that for
large g, there exist graphs G embeddable into the orientable surface of genus
g, such that with large probability a random hyperbolic metric does not admit a
shortest path embedding of G, where the probability measure is proportional to
the Weil-Petersson volume on moduli space.

model is inspired by T. cruzi, a parasite transmitted by trophic and vectorial
mechanisms. Our ecological network model is represented by a multiplex in which
nodes represent species populations interacting through a food web and a
parasite contaminative layer at the same time. We modelled an SI dynamics in
two different scenarios: a simple theoretical food web and an empirical one.
Our simulations in both scenarios show that the infection is more widespread
when both the trophic and the contaminative interactions are considered with
equal rates. This indicates that trophic and contaminative transmission may
have additive effects in real ecosystems. We also find that the ratio of
vectors-to-host in the community (i) crucially influences the infection spread,
(ii) regulates a percolating phase transition in the rate of parasite
transmission and (iii) increases the infection rate in hosts. By immunising the
same fractions of predator and prey populations, we show that the multiplex
topology is fundamental in outlining the role that each host species plays in
parasite transmission in a given ecosystem. We also show that the multiplex
models provide a richer phenomenology in terms of parasite spreading dynamics
compared to mono-layer models. Our work opens new challenges and provides new
quantitative tools for modelling multi-channel spreading in networked systems.

that is inspired by human brain capabilities in processing complicated
information. ALM, which is in essence an adaptive fuzzy learning method, models
a Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) system with several Single-Input
Single-Output (SISO) subsystems. Ink Drop Spread (IDS) operator, which is the
main processing engine of this method, extracts useful features from the data
without complicated computations and provides stability and convergence as
well. Despite great performance of ALM in applications such as classification,
clustering, and modelling, an efficient hardware implementation has remained a
challenging problem. Large amount of memory required to store the information
of IDS planes as well as the high computational cost of the IDS computing
system are two main barriers to ALM becoming more popular. In this paper, a
novel learning method is proposed based on the idea of IDS, but with a novel
approach that eliminates the computational cost of IDS operator. Unlike
traditional approaches, our proposed method finds functions to describe the IDS
plane that eliminates the need for large amount of memory to a great extent.
Narrow Path and Spread, which are two main features used in the inference
engine of ALM, are then extracted from IDS planes with minimum amount of memory
usage and power consumption. Our proposed algorithm is fully compatible with
memristor-crossbar implementation that leads to a significant decrease in the
number of required memristors (from O(n^2) to O(3n)). Simpler algorithm and
higher speed make our algorithm suitable for applications where real-time
process, low-cost and small implementation are paramount. Applications in
clustering and function approximation are provided, which reveals the effective
performance of our proposed algorithm.

Emission line maps in hydrogen Balmer and Paschen lines were formed from
analysis of the MUSE cubes. The measured electron temperature and density from
the MUSE cube were employed to predict the theoretical hydrogen line ratios and
map the extinction distribution across the nebula. After correction for the
interstellar extinction to NGC 7009, the internal dust-to-gas ratio (A_V/N_H)
has been mapped for the first time in a PN. The extinction map of NGC 7009 has
considerable structure, broadly corresponding to the morphological features of
the nebula. A large-scale feature in the extinction map, consisting of a crest
and trough, occurs at the rim of the inner shell. The nature of this feature
was investigated and instrumental and physical causes considered; no convincing
mechanisms were identified to produce this feature, other than mass loss
variations in the earlier asymptotic giant branch phase. The dust-to-gas ratio
A_V/N_H increases from 0.7 times the interstellar value to >5 times from the
centre towards the periphery of the ionized nebula. The integrated A_V/N_H is
about 2 times the mean ISM value. It is demonstrated that extinction mapping

accretion rate, X-ray binary systems are not usually found in the soft spectral
state. However, at accretion rates a factor of a few lower still, in the hard
state, there is another spectral transition which is well observed but not well
understood. Below ~0.5-1 per cent of the Eddington accretion rate (m_crit), the
spectral index hardens with increasing accretion rate, but above m_crit,
although still in the hard state, the spectral index softens with increasing
accretion rate. Here we use a combination of X-ray spectral fitting and a study
of short time-scale spectral variability to examine the behaviour of three
well-known X-ray binaries: Cygnus X-1, GX 339-4 and XTE J1118+480.
  In Cygnus X-1 we find separate hard and soft continuum components, and show
using root-mean-square (rms) spectra that the soft component dominates the
variability. The spectral transition at m_crit is clearly present in the
hard-state hardness-intensity diagrams of Cygnus X-1. Above m_crit, GX 339-4
shows similar softer-when-brighter behaviour at both long and short
time-scales. Similarly, XTE J1118+480, which remains well below m_crit, is
harder-when-brighter behaviour on all time-scales.
  We interpret these results in terms of two continuum components: a hard
power-law which dominates the spectra when the accretion rate is low, probably
arising from Comptonisation of cyclo-synchrotron photons from the corona, and a
soft power-law which dominates at higher accretion rates, arising from
Comptonisation of seed photons from the accretion disc.

applications in random access memories. While recent experimental work has
shown that inserting a metallic ""oxygen scavenger layer"" between the positive
electrode and oxide improves device performance, the fundamental understanding
of how the scavenger layer modifies heterostructure properties is lacking. We
use density functional theory to calculate thermodynamic properties and
conductance of TiN/HfO$_2$/TiN heterostructures with and without Ta scavenger
layer. First, we show that Ta insertion lowers the formation energy of
low-resistance states. Second, while the Ta scavenger layer reduces the
Schottky barrier height in the high-resistance state by modifying the interface
charge at the oxide-electrode interface, the heterostructure maintains a high
resistance ratio between high- and low-resistance states. Finally, we show that
the low-bias conductance of device on-states becomes much less sensitive to the
spatial distribution of oxygen removed from the HfO$_2$ in the presence of the
Ta layer. By providing fundamental understanding of the observed improvements
with scavenger layers, we open a path to engineer interfaces with oxygen
scavenger layers to control and enhance device performance. In turn, this may
enable the realization of a non-volatile low-power memory technology with
concomitant reduction in energy consumption by consumer electronics and
significant benefits to society.

difference between the PeV neutrino and gamma-ray photons from blazar flares
can be used to constrain the violations of equivalence principle (EP) and the
Lorentz invariance for neutrinos. From the calculated Shapiro delay due to
clusters or superclusters in the nearby universe, we find that violation of the
equivalence principle for neutrinos and photons is constrained to an accuracy
of at least $10^{-5}$, which is two orders of magnitude tighter than the
constraint placed by MeV neutrinos from supernova 1987A. Lorentz invariance
violation (LIV) arises in various quantum-gravity theories, which predicts an
energy-dependent velocity of propagation in vacuum for photons and neutrinos.
We find that the association of the PeV neutrino with the gamma-ray outburst
set limits on the energy scale of possible LIV to $> 0.01 E_{pl}$ for linear
LIV models and $>6\times 10^{-8} E_{pl}$ for quadratic order LIV models, where

large-angle anomalies detected in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which
are hypothesized as the result of the statistical inhomogeneity developed by
different isocurvature fields of mass $m\sim H$ present during inflation. The
inhomogeneity arises as the combined effect of $(i)$ the initial conditions for
isocurvature fields (obtained after a fast-roll stage finishing many
$e$-foldings before cosmological scales exit the horizon), $(ii)$ their
inflationary fluctuations and $(iii)$ their coupling to other degrees of
freedom. Our case of interest is when these fields (interpreted as the
precursors of large-angle anomalies) leave an observable imprint only in
isolated patches of the Universe. When the latter intersect the last scattering
surface, such imprints arise in the CMB. Nevertheless, due to their
statistically inhomogeneous nature, these imprints are difficult to detect, for
they become hidden in the background similarly to the Cold Spot. We then
compute the probability that a single isocurvature field becomes inhomogeneous
at the end of inflation and find that, if the appropriate conditions are given
(which depend exclusively on the preexisting fast-roll stage), this probability
is at the percent level. Finally, we discuss several mechanisms (including the
curvaton and the inhomogeneous reheating) to investigate whether an initial
statistically inhomogeneous isocurvature field fluctuation might give rise to
some of the observed anomalies. In particular, we focus on the Cold Spot, the
power deficit at low multipoles and the breaking of statistical isotropy.

of these photons is poorly determined by direct measurements due to significant
galactic foregrounds. Studying the absorption of $\gamma$ rays from
extragalactic sources at different distances allows the density of low-energy
diffuse photons to be measured. Gamma-ray propagation may also be affected by
new phenomena predicted by extensions of the Standard Model of particle
physics. Lorentz Invariance is violated in some models of Quantum Gravity,
leading to an energy-dependent speed of light in vacuum. From differential
time-of-flight measurements of the most distant $\gamma$-ray bursts and of
flaring active galactic nuclei, lower bounds have been set on the energy scale
of Quantum Gravity. Another effect that may alter $\gamma$-ray propagation is
predicted by some models of String Theory, namely the mixing of the $\gamma$
ray with a light fundamental boson called an ""axion-like particle"", which does
not interact with low-energy photons. Such a mixing would make the Universe
more transparent to $\gamma$ rays than what would otherwise be, in a sense it

and cognitive specializations, with important implications for neuroscience and
medicine. Different MRI acquisitions provide different brain networks at the
macroscale; whilst diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) provides a structural
connectivity (SC) coincident with the bundles of parallel fibers between brain
areas, functional MRI (fMRI) accounts for the variations in the
blood-oxygenation-level-dependent T2* signal, providing functional connectivity
(FC).Understanding the precise relation between FC and SC, that is, between
brain dynamics and structure, is still a challenge for neuroscience. To
investigate this problem, we acquired data at rest and built the corresponding
SC (with matrix elements corresponding to the fiber number between brain areas)
to be compared with FC connectivity matrices obtained by 3 different methods:
directed dependencies by an exploratory version of structural equation modeling
(eSEM), linear correlations (C) and partial correlations (PC). We also
considered the possibility of using lagged correlations in time series; so, we
compared a lagged version of eSEM and Granger causality (GC). Our results were
two-fold: firstly, eSEM performance in correlating with SC was comparable to
those obtained from C and PC, but eSEM (not C nor PC) provides information
about directionality of the functional interactions. Second, interactions on a
time scale much smaller than the sampling time, captured by instantaneous
connectivity methods, are much more related to SC than slow directed influences
captured by the lagged analysis. Indeed the performance in correlating with SC
was much worse for GC and for the lagged version of eSEM. We expect these
results to supply further insights to the interplay between SC and functional
patterns, an important issue in the study of brain physiology and function.

oscillatory decay as a function of the distance to the edge. This is in
contrast to the behavior of the edge states in HgTe quantum wells, which decay
into the bulk in a simple exponential manner. The difference between the two
materials is brought about by spatial separation of electrons and holes in
InAs/GaSb, which affects the magnitudes of the parameters describing the
particle-hole asymmetry and the strength of intersubband coupling within the
Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. We show that the character of the wave function
decay impacts directly the dependence of the point contact conductance on the
constriction width and the Fermi energy, which can be verified experimentally
and serve to determine accurately the values of relevant parameters. In the
case of InAs/GaSb heterostructures the conductance magnitude oscillates as a
function of the constriction width following the oscillations of the edge state
penetration, whereas in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells a single switching from
transmitting to reflecting contact is predicted.

spin related phenomena derived from the combination of topology and magnetism.
In the present work we show the controlled occurrence of either metallic or
gapped topological Dirac states at the interface between ultrathin Cr films and
the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ surface. The opening and closing of the gap at the Dirac point
is caused by the spin reorientation transitions arising in the Cr films. We
find that atom thin layers of Cr adhered to Bi$_2$Se$_3$ surfaces present a
magnetic ground state with ferromagnetic planes coupled antiferromagnetically.
As the thickness of the Cr film increases stepwise from one to three atomic
layers, the direction of the magnetization changes twice from out-of-plane to
in-plane and to out-of-plane again. The out of plane magnetization drives the
gap opening and the topological surface states acquire a circular meron spin
structure. Therefore, the Cr spin reorientation leads to the metal/insulator
transition in the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ surface and to the correlated modification of
the surface state spin texture. Consequently, the thickness of the Cr film
provides an effective and controllable mechanism to modify the metallic or
gapped nature, as well as the spin texture of the topological Dirac states.

  system","13 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For electro-optical imaging systems, line-of-sight stabilization against
different disturbances created by mobile platforms is crucial property. The
development of high resolution sensors and the demand in increased operating
distances have recently increased the expectations from stabilization loops.
For that reason, higher gains and larger bandwidths become necessary. As the
stabilization loop satisfies these requirements for good disturbance
attenuation, it must also satisfy sufficient loop stability. In gimbaled
imaging systems, the main difficulties in satisfying sufficient loop stability
are structural resonances and model uncertainties. Therefore, satisfying high
stabilization performance in the presence of model uncertainties or modeling
errors requires utilization of robust control methods. In this paper, robust
LQG/LTR controller design is described for a two-axis gimbal. First, the
classical LQG/LTR method is modified such that it becomes very powerful loop
shaping method. Next, using this method, controller is synthesized. Robust
stability and robust performance of stabilization loop is investigated by using
singular value tests. The report is concluded with the experimental validation
of the designed robust controller.

suffering, a massive refugee crisis, and growth of ISIS extremism and its

ethnic geography is a central reason for the large number of different groups
in conflict as this geography leads to local allegiances that do not aggregate
at the national scale. We have previously demonstrated that, where ethnic
groups exist in geographic patches of 20-60 km in diameter, there is a high
probability of conflict. We have also shown that establishing local autonomy
through subnational boundaries (as is found in Switzerland) is a means of
alleviating conflict. Our analysis suggests that providing some level of local
autonomy to the ethnic groups would reduce the impetus for local conflict and
could serve as a basis for peace and stability. Here we propose that
interventions should be pursued to stop specific individual local conflicts,
creating safe zones, that can be expanded gradually and serve as examples for
achieving a comprehensive solution for safety, peace and stable local
governance in Syria.

of clinical research to assess interventions. However, RCTs cannot always be
applied for practical or ethical reasons. To investigate the current practices
in rare diseases, we review evaluations of therapeutic interventions in
paediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). In
particular, we shed light on the endpoints used, the study designs implemented
and the statistical methodologies applied.
  METHODS: We conducted literature searches to identify relevant primary
studies. Data on study design, objectives, endpoints, patient characteristics,
randomization and masking, type of intervention, control, withdrawals and
statistical methodology were extracted from the selected studies. The risk of
bias and the quality of the studies were assessed.
  RESULTS: Twelve (seven) primary studies on paediatric MS (CJD) were included
in the qualitative synthesis. No double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled
trial for evaluating interventions in paediatric MS has been published yet.
Evidence from one open-label RCT is available. The observational studies are
before-after studies or controlled studies. Three of the seven selected studies
on CJD are RCTs, of which two received the maximum mark on the Oxford Quality
Scale. Four trials are controlled observational studies.
  CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from double-blind RCTs on the efficacy of treatments
appears to be variable between rare diseases. With regard to paediatric
conditions it remains to be seen what impact regulators will have through e.g.,
paediatric investigation plans. Overall, there is space for improvement by
using innovative trial designs and data analysis techniques.

weighted (MS-DW) images from echo-planar imaging (EPI) acquisitions.
  Methods: Current EPI-based MS-DW reconstruction methods rely on the explicit
estimation of the motion- induced phase maps to recover the unaliased images.
In the new formulation, the k-space data of the unaliased DWI is recovered
using a structured low-rank matrix completion scheme, which does not require
explicit estimation of the phase maps. The structured matrix is obtained as the
lifting of the multi-shot data. The smooth phase-modulations between shots
manifest as null-space vectors of this matrix, which implies that the
structured matrix is low-rank. The missing entries of the structured matrix are
filled in using a nuclear-norm minimization algorithm subject to the
data-consistency. The formulation enables the natural introduction of
smoothness regularization, thus enabling implicit motion-compensated recovery
of fully-sampled as well as under-sampled MS-DW data.
  Results: Our experiments on in-vivo data show effective removal of the
ghosting artifacts arising from intershot motion in MS-DW data using the
proposed method. The performance is comparable and better in certain cases than
conventional phase-based methods.
  Conclusion: The proposed method can achieve effective unaliasing of
fully/under-sampled MS-DW images without using explicit phase estimates.

least because of their utility in predicting the evolution of real-world
contagions and in formulating control measures. It is often the case, however,
that discrete-time approaches are employed to analyze such models or to
simulate them numerically. In such cases, time is discretized into uniform
steps and transition rates between states are replaced by transition
probabilities. In this paper, we illustrate potential limitations to this
approach. We show how discretizing time leads to a restriction on the values of
the model parameters that can accurately be studied. We examine numerical
simulation schemes employed in the literature, showing how synchronous-type
updating schemes can bias discrete-time formalisms when compared against
continuous-time formalisms. Event-based simulations, such as the Gillespie
algorithm, are proposed as optimal simulation schemes both in terms of
replicating the continuous-time process and computational speed. Finally, we
show how discretizing time can affect the value of the epidemic threshold for
large values of the infection rate and the recovery rate, even if the ratio
between the former and the latter is small.

$f(xy)+\mu(y)g(\sigma(y)x)=h(x)h(y)$.

frequency electromagnetic waves and records the scattered electric field. The
medium is known and homogenous except for some small and penetrable inclusions.
The goal of inversion is to locate and characterize these inclusions from the
data collected by the array, which are corrupted by additive noise. We use
results from random matrix theory to obtain a robust inversion method. We
assess its performance with numerical simulations and quantify the benefit of
measuring more than one component of the scattered electric field.

teachers is critical for maintaining America's global competitiveness.
Unfortunately, only one third of the high school teachers in physics have a
degree in physics and an even smaller number of physical science teachers in
middle school have a good grasp of the scientific content they teach. Moreover,
teachers often lack adequate pedagogical content knowledge to teach science
effectively. Here, we discuss the development, implementation, and assessment
of a course for science and engineering undergraduates designed to increase
awareness and help them develop an interest and a deeper appreciation of the
intellectual demands of physics teaching. The course focused on increasing
student enthusiasm and confidence in teaching by providing well supported
teaching opportunities and exposure to physics education research. The course
assessment methods include 1) pre/post-test measures of attitude and
expectations about science teaching, 2) self and peer evaluation of student
teaching, 3) content-based pre/post-tests given to students who received
instruction from the student teachers, and 4) audio-taped focus group
discussions in the absence of the instructor and TA to evaluate student
perspective on different aspects of the course and its impact.

since such systems are becoming increasingly widespread in the automotive
field. ADAS bring extra comfort to drivers, and this has become a selling
point. But these functions, while useful, must not affect the general safety of
the vehicle which is the manufacturer's responsibility. A significant number of
current ADAS are based on vision systems, and applications such as obstacle
detection and detection of pedestrians have become essential components of
functions such as automatic emergency braking. These systems that preserve and
protect road users take on even more importance with the arrival of the new
Euro NCAP protocols. Therefore the robustness and reliability of ADAS functions
cannot be neglected and car manufacturers need to have tools to ensure that the
ADAS functions running on their vehicles operate with the utmost safety.
Furthermore, the complexity of these systems in conjunction with the nearly
infinite number of parameter combinations related to the usage profile of
functions based on image sensors push us to think about testing optimization
methods and tool standards to support the design and validation phases of ADAS
systems. The resources required for the validation using current methods make
them actually less and less adapted to new active safety features, which induce
very strong dependability requirements. Today, to test the camera-based ADAS,
test vehicles are equipped with these systems and are performing long hours of
driving that can last for years. These tests are used to validate the use of
the function and to verify its response to the requirements described in the
specifications without considering the functional safety standard ISO26262.
