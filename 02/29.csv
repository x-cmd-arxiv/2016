deep hierarchy of layers of latent random variables, each of which follows a
new type of distribution that we call rectified Gaussian. These rectified
Gaussian units allow spike-and-slab type sparsity, while retaining the
differentiability necessary for efficient stochastic gradient variational
inference. To learn the parameters of the new model, we approximate the
posterior of the latent variables with a variational auto-encoder. Rather than
making the usual mean-field assumption however, the encoder parameterizes a new
type of structured variational approximation that retains the prior
dependencies of the generative model. Using this structured posterior
approximation, we are able to perform joint training of deep models with many
layers of latent random variables, without having to resort to stacking or
other layerwise training procedures.

infinity and have pericenter distances greater than $u_c$, whereas orbits of
the second kind have apocenter distances less than $u_c$ and terminate at the
singularity at $u=-\infty$ $(r=0)$. For $D=D_c$ orbits of the first and second
kinds merge and both orbits spiral an infinite number of times toward the
unstable circular orbit $u=u_c$. For $D^2<D_c^2$ we have only orbits of one

contains a power-law tail at high particle energies that smoothly merges with a

source function that is indistinguishable from a thermal spectrum at low
frequencies and transitions to the characteristic self-absorbed synchrotron
spectrum, $\propto \nu^{5/2}$, at high frequency; the linear polarization
fraction for a thermal spectrum is near unity at high frequency; and all

Timing Mode of the EPIC-pn camera provides a great opportunity to investigate
the broadened Fe Kalpha reflection line at 6.4keV with a very high signal to
noise ratio. The 4-500keV energy range is used to constrain the underlying
continuum and the reflection at higher energies. We first investigate the data
by applying a phenomenological model that consists of the sum of an
exponentially cutoff power law and relativistically smeared reflection.
Additionally, we apply a more physical approach and model the irradiation of
the accretion disk directly from the lamp post geometry. All four observations
show consistent values for the black hole parameters with a spin of $a\sim
0.9$, in agreement with recent measurements from reflection and disk continuum
fitting. The inclination is found to be $i\sim30^\circ$, consistent with the
orbital inclination and different from inclination measurements made during the
soft state, which show a higher inclination. We speculate that the difference
between the inclination measurements is due to changes in the inner region of
the accretion disk.

The longitudinal electric field reduces the longitudinal dephasing between the

superluminosity of the wave fronts induced by the plasma in the channel. The
transverse electric field alters the oscillations of the transverse electron
velocity, allowing it to remain anti-parallel to laser electric field and

development of significant oscillations perpendicular to the plane of the

Proper electron injection into the laser beam can further boost the electron

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stw1877",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present post-Newtonian $N$-body simulations on mergers of accreting
stellar-mass black holes (BHs), where such general relativistic effects as the
pericenter shift and gravitational wave (GW) emission are taken into
consideration. The attention is concentrated on the effects of the dynamical
friction and the Hoyle-Lyttleton mass accretion by ambient gas. We consider a
system composed of ten BHs with initial mass of $30~M_\odot$. As a result, we
show that mergers of accreting stellar-mass BHs are classified into four types:
a gas drag-driven, an interplay-driven, a three body-driven, or an
accretion-driven merger. We find that BH mergers proceed before significant
mass accretion, even if the accretion rate is $\sim10$ Eddington accretion
rate, and then all BHs can merge into one heavy BH. Using the simulation
results for a wide range of parameters, we derive a critical accretion rate
($\dot{m}_{\rm c}$), below which the BH growth is promoted faster by mergers.
Also, it is found that the effect of the recoil by the GW emission can reduce
$\dot{m}_{\rm c}$ especially in gas number density higher than $10^8~{\rm
cm}^{-3}$, and enhance the escape probability of merged BHs. Very recently, a
gravitational wave event, GW150914, as a result of the merger of a $\sim
30~M_\odot$ BH binary has been detected (Abbott et al. 2016). Based on the
present simulations, the BH merger in GW150914 is likely to be driven by
three-body encounters accompanied by a few $M_\odot$ of gas accretion, in
high-density environments like dense interstellar clouds or galactic nuclei.

they are all vulnerable to global collapse. Here, we design and build

masses connected by springs, incorporate both translational and rotational

geometrical frustration of collective gear rotations extending through the
assembly. The topological robustness of the mechanical modes makes them
appealing across scales from engineered macrostructures to networks of toothed

statistically and the effects of the environments on the size distribution. As
a result, it is shown that void size distributions obtained from the HOD Mock

inherent vulnerability to demonstrate attacks on some of these technologies.
However, not all of these contributions have resonated widely within aviation

  In this paper, we aim to reconcile the view of the security community and the

of the applications of wireless technologies upon which civil aviation relies.
Based on these applications, we comprehensively analyze vulnerabilities,
attacks, and countermeasures. We categorize the existing research on
countermeasures into approaches that are applicable in the short term and
research of secure new technologies deployable in the long term.
  Since not all of the required aviation knowledge is codified in academic
publications, we additionally examine existing aviation standards and survey
242 international aviation experts. Besides their domain knowledge, we also
analyze the awareness of members of the aviation community concerning the

as the task of determining the prevalences of the different sorts of class
labels in a target dataset. The simplest approach to quantification is Classify
& Count where a classifier is optimised for classification on a training set

case of binary quantification, the number of predicted positive labels is then
used as an estimate of the prevalence of the positive class in the target

to be inferior its results typically are subject to adjustments. However, some
researchers recently have suggested that Classify & Count might actually work
without adjustments if it is based on a classifer that was specifically trained

a coevolutionary cycle between prey swarming behavior and the predator's visual
system, where the predator and prey continually adapt their visual system and

to the well-known ""predator confusion effect."" Furthermore, we provide evidence
that the predator visual system is what drives this coevolutionary cycle, and
suggest that the cycle could be closed if the predator evolves a hybrid visual
system capable of narrow, high-acuity vision for tracking prey as well as
broad, coarse vision for prey discovery. Thus, the conflicting demands imposed
on a predator's visual system by the predator confusion effect could have led
to the evolution of complex eyes in many predators.

particular, kernel-based estimators place minimal assumptions on the data, and
provide improved visualisation over scatterplots and histograms. However kernel
density estimators are known to perform poorly when estimating extreme tail
behaviour, which is important when interest is in process behaviour above some
large threshold, and they can over-emphasise bumps in the density for heavy
tailed data. In this article we develop a transformation kernel density
estimator, and demonstrate that its mean integrated squared error (MISE)
efficiency is equivalent to that of standard, non-tail focused kernel density
estimators. Estimator performance is illustrated in numerical studies, and in

Poisson signals is then applied to derive the final scatter distribution.
Qualitative and quantitative evaluations using thorax and abdomen phantoms with
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, experimental Catphan phantom data, and in vivo
human data acquired for a clinical image guided radiation therapy were
performed. Results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce
scatter artifacts and recover the correct HU in either projection domain or
image domain. For the MC thorax phantom study, four components segmentation
yield the best results, while the results of three components segmentation are
still acceptable. For the Catphan phantom data, the mean value over all pixels
in the residual image is reduced from -21.8 HU to -0.2 HU and 0.7 HU for
projection domain and image domain, respectively. The contrast of the in vivo
human images are greatly improved after correction. The software-based
technique has a number of advantages, such as high computational efficiency and
accuracy, and the capability of performing scatter correction without modifying
the clinical workflow or modifying the imaging hardware. When implemented
practically, this should improve the accuracy of CBCT image quantitation and
significantly impact CBCT-based interventional procedures and adaptive

which has novel collider phenomenology in terms of an unstable ADM bound state

basic features of ADM: the (complex scalar) ADM is charged under a dark local
$U(1)_d$ symmetry which is broken at a low scale and provides a light gauge
boson $X$. The dark gauge coupling is strong and then ADM can annihilate away
into $X$-pair effectively. Therefore, the ADM can form bound state due to its
large self-interaction via $X$ mediation. To explore the collider signature of
ADMonium, we propose that ADM has a two-Higgs doublet portal. The ADMonium can
have a sizable mixing with the heavier Higgs boson, which admits a large cross
section of ADMonium production associated with $b\bar b$. The resulting
signature at the LHC depends on the decays of $X$. In this paper we consider a
case of particular interest: $pp\ra b\bar b+ {\rm ADMonium}$ followed by ${\rm
ADMonium}\ra 2X\ra 2e^+e^-$ where the electrons are identified as (un)converted

achieved by eliminating local unknowns to obtain a global system with
significant reduction of size. In fact, this reduced global system is

  Apparatus",,,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Measurement in quantum mechanics is generally described as an irreversible
process that perturbs the wavefunction describing a quantum system. In this
work we establish a formal connection between the measurement description
within the Copenhagen interpretation (i.e., through the collapse of the
wavefunction) compared versus a picture in which the system and the measurement
apparatus are considered as a whole. We first consider a projective
measurement. In this limiting case, the natural requirements of consistency and
equivalence between the two pictures lead to the rigorous definition of
consistent measuring apparatus: the orthonormal wavefunctions from the Schmidt
decomposition of the system plus apparatus must have non-overlapping supports.
This result arises from the comparison of the two pictures (otherwise hidden),
and while it seems to be an obvious conclusion in the limit of projective
measurements, it has some nontrivial implications as one extends its validity
to the domain of weak measurements. In this respect, we argue on the existence
of two alternative approaches to mathematically constructing a weak measurement
protocol. While the two approaches are equivalent from the system's
perspective, they do strongly differ from the apparatus point of view, and
hence can be only distinguished one from each other in the picture where system
and apparatus are considered as a whole. We show that only one of the two
mathematical formulations of the weak measurement fulfills the consistent
apparatus condition, while the combination of the two gives rise to a
generalized weak measurements framework.

CMOS-based logic because of superior energy-efficiency. One implementation of
nanomagnetic logic employs shape-anisotropic (e.g. elliptical) ferromagnets
(with two stable magnetization orientations) as binary switches that rely on
dipole-dipole interaction to communicate binary information. Normally, circular
nanomagnets are incompatible with this approach since they lack distinct stable
in-plane magnetization orientations to encode bits. However, circular
magnetoelastic nanomagnets can be made bi-stable with a voltage induced
anisotropic strain, which provides two significant advantages for nanomagnetic
logic applications. First, the shape anisotropy energy barrier is eliminated
which reduces the amount of energy to reorient the dipole. Second, the in-plane
size can be reduced (~20nm) which was previously impossible due to thermal
stability issues. In circular magnetoelastic nanomagnets, a voltage induced
strain stabilizes the magnetization even at this size overcoming the thermal
stability issue. In this paper, we analytically demonstrate a binary logic wire
implemented with an array of circular nanomagnets that are clocked with
voltage-induced strain applied by an underlying piezoelectric substrate. This
leads to an energy-efficient logic paradigm orders of magnitude superior to
existing CMOS-based logic that is scalable to dimensions substantially smaller
than those for existing nanomagnetic logic approaches. The analytical approach
is validated with experimental measurements conducted on dipole coupled Ni
nanodots fabricated on a PMN-PT sample.

performed by two spatially separated parties. Such a power has been analyzed by
the gap between the performances of joint quantum operations implementable by
local operations at each party connected by classical communication with and
without the assistance of entanglement. In this work, we present a new
formulation for joint quantum operations connected by classical communication
beyond special relativistic causal order but without entanglement and still
within quantum mechanics. Using the formulation, we show that entanglement

""classical communication"" not respecting causal order. Our results reveal a new
counter-intuitive aspect of entanglement related to spacetime.

activity in the past are both indicative of transient epochs of unusually high

the framework of a solar dynamo model with fluctuating parameters. Solar-type
dynamos are oscillatory because of the combination of the solar-type
differential rotation with positive (in the Northern hemisphere) alpha-effect.
An artificial reversal of the sign in the alpha-effect changes the dynamo to a
steady regime with hundreds of times larger magnetic energy compared to the
amplitude of the cyclic dynamo. Sufficiently large and durable fluctuations
reversing the sign of the alpha-effect during the growth phase of a magnetic
cycle can, therefore, cause a transient change to a steady dynamo with
considerably increased magnetic energy. This qualitative scenario for grand
activity maxima is supported by computations of the dynamo model with a
fluctuating alpha-effect. The computed statistics of several thousand magnetic
cycles gives examples of cycles with very high magnetic energy. Our preliminary
estimations, however, suggest that the probability of solar superflares is
extremely low.

energy of the lower kHz QPO of neutron star binaries can be explained in the
framework of a thermal Comptonization model. It was also shown that such an
interpretation can provide estimates of the size and geometry of the
Comptonizing medium. Here we study the dependence of these estimates on the
time-averaged spectral model assumed and on the frequency of the QPO. We use
the high quality time lag and r.m.s obtained during March 3rd 1996 observation
of 4U 1608-52 by RXTE as well as other observations of the source at different
QPO frequencies where a single time-lag between two broad energy bands have
been reported. We compare the results obtained when assuming that the
time-averaged spectra are represented by the spectrally degenerate ""hot"" and
""cold"" seed photon spectral models. We find that for the ""hot"" seed photon
model the medium size is in the range of 0.3-2.0 kms and the size decreases
with increasing QPO frequency. On the other hand for the ""cold"" seed photon
model the range for the sizes are much larger 0.5-20 kms and hence perhaps show
no variation with QPO frequency. Our results emphasis the need for broad band
spectral information combined with high frequency timing to lift this
degeneracy. We further show that the r.m.s as a function of energy for the
upper kHz QPO is similar to the lower one and indeed we find that the driver
for this QPO should be temperature variations of the corona identical to the
lower kHz QPO. However, the time lag reported for the upper kHz QPO is hard,
which if confirmed, would challenge the simple Comptonization model presented
here. It would perhaps imply that reverberation lags are also important and/or
the dominate spectral component is not a single temperature medium but a
multi-temperature complex one.

Big Data analytics which is targeted at how to train memory-resident models

solution for Big Model analytics. We identify dot-product as the primary
operation for training generalized linear models and introduce the first

extensively studied sparse matrix vector multiplication (SpMV) kernel. The
paramount challenge in designing the dot-product join operator is how to
optimally schedule access to the dense relation based on the non-contiguous
entries in the sparse arrays. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and propose
a practical solution characterized by two technical contributions---dynamic
batch processing and array reordering. We devise three heuristics -- LSH,
Radix, and K-center -- for array reordering and analyze them thoroughly. We
execute extensive experiments over synthetic and real data that confirm the
minimal overhead the operator incurs when sufficient memory is available and
the graceful degradation it suffers as memory becomes scarce. Moreover,
dot-product join achieves an order of magnitude reduction in execution time
over alternative in-database solutions.

an imaging contrast is generated by scattering of neutrons off micrometer-sized
inhomogeneities. Although the scatterer cannot be resolved it leads to a
measurable local decoherence of the beam. Here, a report is given on the design

bears a close analogy to classical mechanics and has been drawing growing
attention, especially in simulating quantum many-body systems. However,
deterministic numerical solutions have been almost exclusively confined to
one-dimensional one-body systems and few results are reported even for
one-dimensional two-body problems. This paper serves as the first attempt to
solve the time-dependent many-body Wigner equation through a grid-based
advective-spectral-mixed method. The main feature of the method is to resolve
the linear advection in $(\bm{x},t)$-space by an explicit three-step
characteristic scheme coupled with the piecewise cubic spline interpolation,
while the Chebyshev spectral element method in $\bm k$-space is adopted for
accurate calculation of the nonlocal pseudo-differential term. Not only the
time step of the resulting method is not restricted by the usual CFL condition
and thus a large time step is allowed, but also the mass conservation can be
maintained. In particular, for the system consisting of identical particles,
the advective-spectral-mixed method can also rigorously preserve physical
symmetry relations. The performance is validated through several typical
numerical experiments, like the Gaussian barrier scattering, electron-electron
interaction and a Helium-like system, where the third-order accuracy against

We say that $\Omega$ is
spectral if the space $L^2(\Omega)$ admits an orthogonal basis consisting of
exponential functions. There is a conjecture, which goes back to Fuglede
(1974), that $\Omega$ is spectral if and only if it can tile the space by
translations. It is known that if $\Omega$ tiles then it is spectral, but the
converse was proved only in dimension $d=2$, by Iosevich, Katz and Tao.
  By a result due to Kolountzakis, if a convex polytope $\Omega\subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ is spectral, then it must be centrally symmetric. We prove that
also all the facets of $\Omega$ are centrally symmetric. These conditions are
necessary for $\Omega$ to tile by translations.
  We also develop an approach which allows us to prove that in dimension $d=3$,
any spectral convex polytope $\Omega$ indeed tiles by translations. Thus we
obtain that Fuglede's conjecture is true for convex polytopes in
$\mathbb{R}^3$.

this work we derive a theory defining a fractionalized analogue of the Weyl
semimetal state: the fractional chiral metal. Our approach is to construct a
4+1D quantum Hall insulator by stacking 3+1D Weyl semimetals in a magnetic
field. In a strong enough field the low-energy physics is determined by the
lowest Landau level of each Weyl semimetal, which is highly degenerate and
chiral, motivating us to use a coupled-wire approach. The one-dimensional
dispersion of the lowest Landau level allows us to model the system as a set of
degenerate 1+1D quantum wires that can be bosonized in the presence of
electron-electron interactions and coupled such that a gapped phase is
obtained, whose response to an electromagnetic field is given in terms of a
Chern-Simons field theory. At the boundary of this phase we obtain the field
theory of a 3+1D gapless fractional chiral state, which we show is consistent
with a previous theory for the surface of a 4+1D Chern-Simons theory. The
boundary's response to an external electromagnetic field is determined by a
chiral anomaly with a fractionalized coefficient. We suggest that such
anomalous response can be taken as a working definition of a fractionalized
strongly correlated analogue of the Weyl semimetal state.

throughput and uniform coverage in the fifth generation (5G) wireless networks,
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems have attracted
significant attention in recent years. However, in massive MIMO systems, as the
density of mobile users (MUs) increases, conventional uplink training methods
will incur prohibitively high training overhead, which is proportional to the
number of MUs. In this paper, we propose a selective uplink training method for
massive MIMO systems, where in each channel block only part of the MUs will
send uplink pilots for channel training, and the channel states of the
remaining MUs are predicted from the estimates in previous blocks, taking
advantage of the channels' temporal correlation. We propose an efficient
algorithm to dynamically select the MUs to be trained within each block and
determine the optimal uplink training length. Simulation results show that the
proposed training method provides significant throughput gains compared to the
existing methods, while much lower estimation complexity is achieved. It is
observed that the throughput gain becomes higher as the MU density increases.

the response to near field excitation by a point source. Based on a
point-dipole theory using Ewald summation and an array scanning method, we can
swiftly and semi-analytically evaluate the local density of states (LDOS) for
magnetoelectric point sources in front of an infinite two-dimensional (2D)
lattice composed of arbitrary magnetoelectric dipole scatterers. The method
takes into account radiation damping as well as all retarded electrodynamic
interactions in a self-consistent manner. We show that a lattice of magnetic
scatterers evidences characteristic Drexhage oscillations. However, the
oscillations are phase shifted relative to the electrically scattering lattice
consistent with the difference expected for reflection off homogeneous magnetic
respectively electric mirrors. Furthermore, we identify in which source-surface
separation regimes the metasurface may be treated as a homogeneous interface,
and in which homogenization fails. A strong frequency and in-plane position
dependence of the LDOS close to the lattice reveals coupling to guided modes

frequencies.
  We characterize the spectral properties of the blazar population at low radio
frequency compare the radio and high-energy properties of the gamma-ray blazar
population, and search for radio counterparts of unidentified gamma-ray
sources.
  We cross-correlated the 6,100 deg^2 Murchison Widefield Array Commissioning
Survey catalogue with the Roma blazar catalogue, the third catalogue of active
galactic nuclei detected by Fermi-LAT, and the unidentified members of the
entire third catalogue of gamma-ray sources detected by \fermilat. When
available, we also added high-frequency radio data from the Australia Telescope
20 GHz catalogue.
  We find low-frequency counterparts for 186 out of 517 (36%) blazars, 79 out
of 174 (45%) gamma-ray blazars, and 8 out of 73 (11%) gamma-ray blazar
candidates. The mean low-frequency (120--180 MHz) blazar spectral index is
$\langle \alpha_\mathrm{low} \rangle=0.57\pm0.02$: blazar spectra are flatter
than the rest of the population of low-frequency sources, but are steeper than
at $\sim$GHz frequencies. Low-frequency radio flux density and gamma-ray energy
flux display a mildly significant and broadly scattered correlation. Ten
unidentified gamma-ray sources have a (probably fortuitous) positional match
with low radio frequency sources.
  Low-frequency radio astronomy provides important information about sources
with a flat radio spectrum and high energy. However, the relatively low
sensitivity of the present surveys still misses a significant fraction of these
objects. Upcoming deeper surveys, such as the GaLactic and Extragalactic

due to various practical needs; specifically, sequences are required to be
unimodular or of low peak-to-average power ratio (PAR). For unimodular sequence
design, plenty of efforts have been devoted to obtaining good correlation
properties. Regarding channel estimation, however, sequences of such properties
do not necessarily help produce optimal estimates. Tailored unimodular
sequences for the specific criterion concerned are desirable especially when
the prior knowledge of the channel is taken into account as well. In this
paper, we formulate the problem of optimal unimodular sequence design for
minimum mean square error estimation of the channel impulse response and
conditional mutual information maximization, respectively. Efficient algorithms
based on the majorization-minimization framework are proposed for both problems
with guaranteed convergence. As the unimodular constraint is a special case of
the low PAR constraint, optimal sequences of low PAR are also considered.
Numerical examples are provided to show the performance of the proposed
training sequences, with the efficiency of the derived algorithms demonstrated.

extensions of widely-studied single agent learning policies to the network

class of non-altruistic and individually consistent policies, and argue by
deriving regret lower bounds that they are liable to suffer a large regret in
the networked setting. We also show that the learning performance can be
substantially improved if the agents exploit the structure of the network, and
develop a simple learning algorithm based on dominating sets of the network.
Specifically, we first consider a star network, which is a common motif in
hierarchical social networks, and show analytically that the hub agent can be
used as an information sink to expedite learning and improve the overall
regret. We also derive networkwide regret bounds for the algorithm applied to
general networks. We conduct numerical experiments on a variety of networks to

during the burst-phase of folding. We study Protein L folding using a
coarse-grained model and molecular dynamics simulations. The collapse
transition in Protein L is found to be concomitant with the folding transition.
In the burst-phase of folding, we find that FRET experiments overestimate
radius of gyration, $R_g$, of the protein due to the application of Gaussian
polymer chain end-to-end distribution to extract $R_g$ from the FRET
efficiency. FRET experiments estimate $\approx$ 6\AA \ decrease in $R_g$ when
the actual decrease is $\approx$ 3\AA \ on Guanidinium Chloride denaturant
dilution from 7.5M to 1M, and thereby suggesting pronounced compaction in the
protein dimensions in the burst-phase. The $\approx$ 3\AA \ decrease is close
to the statistical uncertainties of the $R_g$ data measured from SAXS
experiments, which suggest no compaction, leading to a disagreement with the
FRET experiments. The transition state ensemble (TSE) structures in Protein L

shown that the potential energy surfaces of bilayer h-BN can be approximated by
the first Fourier components determined by symmetry. As a result, a wide set of
physical qualintities describing relative motion of h-BN layers aligned in the

mode frequency and shear modulus are determined by a single parameter
corresponding to the roughness of the potential energy surface, similar to
bilayer graphene. The properties of h-BN layers aligned in the opposite

the improved \FH bounds into bounds on the expectation of $f(\mathbf{S})$, we
develop an alternative representation of multivariate integrals with respect to
copulas that admits also quasi-copulas as integrators. By means of this
representation, we provide an integral characterization of orthant orders on
the set of quasi-copulas which relates the improved \FH bounds to bounds on the
expectation of $f(\mathbf{S})$. Finally, we apply these results to compute
model-free bounds on the prices of multi-asset options that take partial
information on the dependence structure into account, such as correlations or
market prices of other traded derivatives. The numerical results show that the
additional information leads to a significant improvement of the option price
bounds compared to the situation where only the marginal distributions are
known.

capabilities of a quantum channel. The main conceptual development builds
firmly on the notion of a private state, which is a powerful, uniquely quantum
method for simplifying the tripartite picture of privacy involving local
operations and public classical communication to a bipartite picture of quantum
privacy involving local operations and classical communication. This approach
has previously led to some of the strongest upper bounds on secret key rates,
including the squashed entanglement and the relative entropy of entanglement.
Here we use this approach along with a ""privacy test"" to establish a general
meta-converse bound for private communication, which has a number of
applications. The meta-converse allows for proving that any quantum channel's
relative entropy of entanglement is a strong converse rate for private
communication. For covariant channels, the meta-converse also leads to
second-order expansions of relative entropy of entanglement bounds for private
communication rates. For such channels, the bounds also apply to the private
communication setting in which the sender and receiver are assisted by
unlimited public classical communication, and as such, they are relevant for
establishing various converse bounds for quantum key distribution protocols
conducted over these channels. We find precise characterizations for several
channels of interest and apply the methods to establish several converse bounds
on the private transmission capabilities of all phase-insensitive bosonic
channels.

geometry (angle between speed gradient in front of piston and satellite
trajectory) and full jumps of speed in edges of compression regions. One of
consequences of this hypothesis is the conclusion that one of the reasons of
observed distinctions of parameters in MC and Ejecta can be fact that at
measurements of Ejecta the satellite passes further from the nose area of ICME,

spin-flip dynamics on random graphs. We fix a large number of vertices and
randomly allocate edges according to the Configuration Model with a prescribed
degree distribution. Each vertex carries a spin that can point either up or
down. Each spin interacts with a positive magnetic field, while spins at
vertices that are connected by edges also interact with each other via a
ferromagnetic pair potential. We start from the configuration where all spins
point down, and allow spins to flip up or down according to a Metropolis
dynamics at positive temperature. We are interested in the time it takes the
system to reach the configuration where all spins point up. In order to achieve
this transition, the system needs to create a sufficiently large droplet of
up-spins, called critical droplet, which triggers the crossover.
  In the limit as the temperature tends to zero, and subject to a certain
\emph{key hypothesis} implying metastable behaviour, the average crossover time
follows the classical \emph{Arrhenius law}, with an exponent and a prefactor
that are controlled by the \emph{energy} and the \emph{entropy} of the critical
droplet. The crossover time divided by its average is exponentially
distributed. We study the scaling behaviour of the exponent as the number of
vertices tends to infinity, deriving upper and lower bounds. We also identify a
regime for the magnetic field and the pair potential in which the key
hypothesis is satisfied. The critical droplets, representing the saddle points
for the crossover, have a size that is of the order of the number of vertices.
This is because the random graphs generated by the Configuration Model are
expander graphs.

D2D link to access the same channel, while mode selection and resource
allocation are typically separately designed. In this paper, we jointly
optimize the mode selection and channel assignment in a cellular network with
underlaying D2D communications, where multiple D2D links may share the same

guaranteed, in terms of Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR). We
first propose an optimal dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, which provides a
much lower computation complexity compared to exhaustive search and serves as
the performance bench mark. A bipartite graph based greedy algorithm is then
proposed to achieve a polynomial time complexity. Simulation results will

refutation of the existence of discrete states is crucial for the solution of

equidistantly along an actin filament produce X-ray pattern which varies with
the type of conformation. If the lever arms of all myosin heads reside in one
and the same position (continuous conformation), all the heads have the same
form-factor and equally scatter electromagnetic wave. In this case, only the
geometric factor associated with a spatial ordering of the heads will determine
the X-ray pattern. The situation changes if the average lever arm position is
the same, but inherently every head can reside only in several diverse discrete
states, hopping irregularly from one to another. In this case, the form-factors
corresponding to distinct states are dissimilar, and the increments in phases
of X-rays scattered by different heads are different as well. Inasmuch as every
quantum of radiation interacts with the heads residing in different states,
this results in additional interference and some peaks in the X-ray pattern
should slacken or even extinct as compared with the pattern from the heads with
the continuous-type conformation. The formulas describing both cases are
compared in this article. In general, the distinction between X-ray patterns is
insignificant, but they could be appreciably different at some stages of
conformation process (respective lever arm position depends on the type of

drastically reduced. For instance, we prove that minimum spanning tree can be
certified with $O(\log n)$-bit certificates in $n$-node graphs, with just one
interaction between the prover and the disprover, while it is known that
certifying MST requires $\Omega(\log^2 n)$-bit certificates if only the prover
can act. The improvement can even be exponential for some simple graph
properties. For instance, it is known that certifying the existence of a
nontrivial automorphism requires $\Omega(n^2)$ bits if only the prover can act.
We show that there is a protocol with two interactions between the prover and
the disprover enabling to certify nontrivial automorphism with $O(\log n)$-bit

Bullock 2004) and the $\beta$ profile, and estimate the detectability against
the synergy of a fiducial galaxy survey with number density $10^{-3}h^3\,$
Mpc$^{-3}$ and an ACT-like SZ survey. We show that the shape of the filter does
not change much with redshift for the $\beta$ profile, while there are
significant side lobes at $z<0.1$ for the MB profile. By stacking $\sim 10^4$
Milky Way-size halos around z $\sim 0.5$, one can get $\gtrsim$ 1 $\sigma$
signal to noise (S/N) for the both profiles. The S/N increases with decreasing
redshift before it reaches a maximum ($\sim$ 7.5 at z $\simeq$ 0.15 for the MB

beam size, a Planck-like CMB survey can marginally detect the kSZ signal by

suppression of magnetic order in epitaxial films of chemically disordered FeRh.
X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and electronic structure
calculations reveal that the lowering of symmetry (from cubic to tetragonal)
imposed by the epitaxial relation leads to a further, unexpected,
tetragonal-to-orthorhombic transition, triggered by a band-Jahn-Teller-type
lattice instability. The collapse of magnetic order is a direct consequence of
this structural change, which upsets the subtle balance between ferromagnetic
nearest-neighbor interactions arising from Fe-Rh hybridization and frustrated
antiferromagnetic coupling among localized Fe moments at larger distances.

relativistic density function theory. The long-range van der Waals (vdW)
interactions were incorporated into the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)
exchange-correlation functional using the Tkatchenko-Scheffler pairwise scheme.
Our results reveal that hydrogen bonding, which is well described by the PBE
functional, plays a decisive role for the structural parameters of these
systems, including the position and orientation of the organic cation as well
as the deformation of the inorganic framework. The magnitude of the
inorganic-framework deformation depends sensitively on the orientation of the
organic cation, and directly influences the stability of the hybrid
perovskites. Our results suggest that the organic and the inorganic components
complement each other: The low symmetry of the organic cation is the origin of
the inorganic-framework deformation, which then aids the overall stabilization
of the hybrid perovskite structure. This stabilization is indirectly affected
by vdW interactions, which lead to smaller unit-cell volumes than in PBE and
therefore modulate the interaction between the organic cation and the inorganic
framework. The vdW-induced lattice-constant corrections are system dependent
and lead to PBE+vdW lattice constants in good agreement with experiment.
Further insight is gained by analysing the vdW contributions. In all
iodide-based hybrid perovskites the interaction between the organic cation and
the iodide anions provides the largest lattice-constant change, followed by
iodine-iodine and the organic cation - heavy-metal cation interaction. These
corrections follow an almost linear dependence on the lattice constant within
the range considered in our study, and are therefore approximately additive.

  We outline the previously developed spin-charge gauge approach to
superconductivity in hole-doped cuprates: we decompose the hole of the $t-t'-J$
model for the $\mathrm{Cu}\mathrm{O}_2$ planes as the product of a spinful,
chargeless gapped spinon and of a spinless, charged holon with Fermi surface.
Each one of these particle excitations is bound to a statistical gauge flux,
allowing one to optimize their statistics.
  We show that this model allows for a natural interpretation of the
universality: within this approach, under suitable conditions, the spinonic and
holonic contributions to a response function sum up according to a Ioffe-Larkin
rule. We argue that, if the spinonic contribution dominates, then one should
expect strongly non-Fermi-liquid-like universality, due to the insensitivity of
spinons to Fermi surface details. The in-plane resistivity and superfluid
density are indeed dominated by the spinons in the underdoped region. We
theoretically derive these quantities, discussing their universal behaviours

scaling hierarchy derived by head/tail breaks - a classification scheme and a

Alexander's profound thoughts more accessible to design practitioners and

reduce the mystery of wholeness and brings new insights to Alexander's thoughts
on the concept of wholeness or objective beauty that exists in fine and deep
structure. The complex-network perspective enables us to see things in their
wholeness, and to better understand how the kind of structural beauty emerges
from local actions guided by the 15 fundamental properties, and by
differentiation and adaptation processes. The wholeness goes beyond current

  We discover that a significant fraction (15 - 18 %) of disk galaxies in the
Hubble Deep Field (0.4 < z < 1.0) as well as in the local Universe (0.02 < z <
0.05) are such pure disk systems (hereafter, PDS). The spatial distribution of
light in these PDS is well described by a single exponential function from the
outskirts to the centre and appears to have remained intact over the last 8
billion years keeping the mean central surface brightness and scale-length
nearly constant. These two disk parameters of PDS are brighter and shorter,
respectively, than of those disks which are part of disk galaxies with bulges.
  Since the fraction of PDS as well as their profile defining parameters do not
change, it indicates that these galaxies have not witnessed either major
mergers or multiple minor mergers since z~1. However, there is substantial
increase in their total stellar mass and total size over the same time range.
This suggests that smooth accretion of cold gas via cosmic filaments is the
most probable mode of their evolution. We speculate that PDS are dynamically
hotter and cushioned in massive dark matter halos which may prevent them from
undergoing strong secular evolution.

  unabridged abstract",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graphical languages offer intuitive and rigorous formalisms for quantum
physics. They can be used to simplify expressions, derive equalities, and do
computations. Yet in order to replace conventional formalisms, rigour alone is
not sufficient: the new formalisms also need to have equivalent deductive
power. This requirement is captured by the property of completeness, which
means that any equality that can be derived using some standard formalism can
also be derived graphically.
  In this thesis, I consider the ZX-calculus, a graphical language for pure
state qubit quantum mechanics. I show that it is complete for pure state
stabilizer quantum mechanics, so any problem within this fragment of quantum
theory can be fully analysed using graphical methods. This includes questions
of central importance in areas such as error-correcting codes or
measurement-based quantum computation. Furthermore, I show that the ZX-calculus
is complete for the single-qubit Clifford+T group, which is approximately
universal: any single-qubit unitary can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy
using only Clifford gates and the T-gate. [...] Lastly, I extend the use of
rigorous graphical languages outside quantum theory to Spekkens' toy theory, a
local hidden variable model that nevertheless exhibits some features commonly
associated with quantum mechanics. [...] I develop a graphical calculus similar
to the ZX-calculus that fully describes Spekkens' toy theory, and show that it
is complete. Hence, stabilizer quantum mechanics and Spekkens' toy theory can
be fully analysed and compared using graphical formalisms.
  Intuitive graphical languages can replace conventional formalisms for the
analysis of many questions in quantum computation and foundations without loss
of mathematical rigour or deductive power.

repeatable and quantitative socket design process is the lack of predictive and
patient specific biomechanical models of the residuum. This study presents the
evaluation of such a model using a combined experimental-numerical approach.
The model geometry and tissue boundaries are derived from MRI. The soft tissue
non-linear elastic and viscoelastic mechanical behavior was evaluated using
inverse finite element analysis (FEA) of in-vivo indentation experiments. A
custom designed robotic in-vivo indentation system was used to provide a rich
experimental data set of force versus time at 18 sites across a limb. During
FEA, the tissues were represented by two layers, namely the skin-adipose layer
and an underlying muscle-soft tissue complex. The non-linear elastic behavior
was modeled using 2nd order Ogden hyperelastic formulations, and
viscoelasticity was modeled using the quasi-linear theory of viscoelasticity.
To determine the material parameters for each tissue, an inverse FEA based
optimization routine was used that minimizes the combined mean of the squared
force differences between the numerical and experimental force-time curves for
indentations at 4 distinct anatomical regions on the residuum. The optimization
provided the following material parameters for the skin-adipose layer: c=5.22
kPa, m=4.79, gamma=3.57 MPa, tau=0.32 s and for the muscle-soft tissue complex:
c=5.20 kPa, m=4.78, gamma=3.47 MPa, tau=0.34 s. These parameters were evaluated
to predict the force-time curves for the remaining 14 anatomical locations. The
mean percentage error (mean absolute error/ maximum experimental force) for
these predictions was 7 +/- 3%. The mean percentage error at the 4 sites used
for the optimization was 4%.

  optical flow",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a large displacement optical flow method that introduces a new
strategy to compute a good local minimum of any optical flow energy functional.
The method requires a given set of discrete matches, which can be extremely
sparse, and an energy functional which locally guides the interpolation from
those matches. In particular, the matches are used to guide a structured
coordinate-descent of the energy functional around these keypoints. It results
in a two-step minimization method at the finest scale which is very robust to
the inevitable outliers of the sparse matcher and able to capture large
displacements of small objects. Its benefits over other variational methods
that also rely on a set of sparse matches are its robustness against very few
matches, high levels of noise and outliers. We validate our proposal using
several optical flow variational models. The results consistently outperform
the coarse-to-fine approaches and achieve good qualitative and quantitative

is an edge in $E$. Word-representable graphs are the subject of a long research
line in the literature initiated in \cite{KP}, and they are the main focus in
the recently published book \cite{KL}. A word $w=w_1\cdots w_{n}$ avoids the
pattern $132$ if there are no $1\leq i_1<i_2<i_3\leq n$ such that
$w_{i_1}<w_{i_3}<w_{i_2}$. The theory of patterns in words and permutations is
a fast growing area discussed in \cite{HM,Kit}.
  A research direction suggested in \cite{KL} is in merging the theories of
word-representable graphs and patterns in words. Namely, given a class of
pattern-avoiding words, can we describe the class of graphs represented by the
words? Our paper provides the first non-trivial results in this direction. We
say that a graph is 132-representable if it can be represented by a
132-avoiding word. We show that each 132-representable graph is necessarily a
circle graph. Also, we show that any tree and any cycle graph are
132-representable, which is a rather surprising fact taking into account that
most of these graphs are non-representable in the sense specified, as a
generalization of the notion of a word-representable graph, in \cite{JKPR}.
Finally, we provide explicit 132-avoiding representations for all graphs on at
most five vertices, and also describe all such representations, and enumerate
them, for complete graphs.

the lightcurve representation. Usually, lightcurves are represented as a vector
of many statistical descriptors designed by astronomers called features. These
descriptors commonly demand significant computational power to calculate,
require substantial research effort to develop and do not guarantee good
performance on the final classification task. Today, lightcurve representation
is not entirely automatic; algorithms that extract lightcurve features are
designed by humans and must be manually tuned up for every survey. The vast
amounts of data that will be generated in future surveys like LSST mean
astronomers must develop analysis pipelines that are both scalable and
automated. Recently, substantial efforts have been made in the machine learning
community to develop methods that prescind from expert-designed and manually
tuned features for features that are automatically learned from data. In this
work we present what is, to our knowledge, the first unsupervised feature
learning algorithm designed for variable stars. Our method first extracts a
large number of lightcurve subsequences from a given set of photometric data,
which are then clustered to find common local patterns in the time series.
Representatives of these patterns, called exemplars, are then used to transform
lightcurves of a labeled set into a new representation that can then be used to
train an automatic classifier. The proposed algorithm learns the features from
both labeled and unlabeled lightcurves, overcoming the bias generated when the
learning process is done only with labeled data. We test our method on MACHO
and OGLE datasets; the results show that the classification performance we
achieve is as good and in some cases better than the performance achieved using
traditional features, while the computational cost is significantly lower.

bounded synchronization delay. He was interested to characterize those regular

allowed operations on the language side which are union, intersection,
concatenation and modified Kleene-star involving a mapping of a prefix code of
bounded synchronization delay to a group $G\in H$, but no complementation. In
our notation this leads to the language classes $SD_G(A^\infty)$ and
$SD_H(A^\infty$). Our main result shows that $SD_H(A^\infty)$ always
corresponds to the languages having syntactic monoids where all subgroups are
in $H$. Sch\""utzenberger showed this for a variety $H$ if $H$ contains Abelian
groups, only. Our method shows the general result for all $H$ directly on
finite and infinite words. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of local Rees
products which refers to a simple type of classical Rees extensions. We give a
decomposition of a monoid in terms of its groups and local Rees products. This
gives a somewhat similar, but simpler decomposition than in Rhodes' synthesis
theorem. Moreover, we need a singly exponential number of operations, only.
Finally, our decomposition yields an answer to a question in a recent paper of

atom-molecular coupled equations, the initial atomic and molecular
wavefunctions were obtained and the dynamics of the initial atomic and
molecular waves in a spherical one-dimensional trap were studied by solving the
time-dependent atom-molecular coupled equations. During evolution two types of
induced or stimulated decays of the feshbach molecules were switched on. These
two types of stimulated decays of the feshbach molecules to the two-atom
continuum and to the bound level of the lowest hyperfinee state of the molecule
were induced by laser or Radio Frequency fields. Hence the strength of these
two induced decays can be controlled by varying the laser or RF field
parameters e.g. intensity, detuning etc. It is found that depending on the
relative strength of these two types of stimulated or induced decays initial
atomic and molecular waves assume solitonic nature as bright solitons during
evolution and the stability of these solitonic waves can be achieved by
controlling the relative strength of induced decays in two different channels.

correspondence we show between the so-called \emph{truly isolated} points of
our complex and the generators of the socle of the defining ideal. In another
relation between the geometry of the complex and the algebra of the ring, we
essentially give a correspondence between the nontrivial connected components
of the complex and the factors of a fibre product representation of the ring.
Finally, we explore algorithms for building survival complexes from specified
isolated points. That is, we work to build the ring out of a description of the
socle.

commuting patterns. But, at the same time, they have drawbacks: they are static
pictures of a dynamic phenomena, are expensive to make, and take prolonged
periods of time to finish. However, the availability of mobile usage data (Call
Detail Records) makes the study of urban mobility possible at levels not known
before. This has been done in the past with good results--mobile data makes
possible to find and understand aggregated mobility patterns. In this paper, we
propose to analyze mobile data at individual level by estimating daily
journeys, and use those journeys to build Origin-Destiny matrices to understand
urban flow. We evaluate this approach with large anonymized CDRs from Santiago,
Chile, and find that our method has a high correlation ($\rho = 0.89$) with the
current travel survey, and that it captures external anomalies in daily travel
patterns, making our method suitable for inclusion into urban computing
applications.

in the redshift range $2.2<z<2.8$. We measure the count-in-sphere, $N(<\! r)$,
i.e. the average number of objects around a given object, and its logarithmic
derivative, the fractal correlation dimension, $D_2(r)$. For a homogeneous
distribution $N(<\! r) \propto r^3$ and $D_2(r)=3$. Due to the uncertainty on
tracer density evolution, 3D surveys can only probe homogeneity up to a
redshift dependence, i.e. they probe so-called ""spatial isotropy"". Our data
demonstrate spatial isotropy of the quasar distribution in the redshift range
$2.2<z<2.8$ in a model-independent way, independent of any FLRW fiducial
cosmology, resulting in $3-\langle D_2 \rangle < 1.7 \times 10^{-3}$ (2
$\sigma$) over the range $250<r<1200 \, h^{-1}$Mpc for the quasar distribution.
If we assume that quasars do not have a bias much less than unity, this implies
spatial isotropy of the matter distribution on large scales. Then, combining
with the Copernican principle, we finally get homogeneity of the matter
distribution on large scales. Alternatively, using a flat $\Lambda$CDM fiducial
cosmology with CMB-derived parameters, and measuring the quasar bias relative
to this $\Lambda$CDM model, our data provide a consistency check of the model,
in terms of how homogeneous the Universe is on different scales. $D_2(r)$ is
found to be compatible with our $\Lambda$CDM model on the whole $10<r<1200 \,
h^{-1}$Mpc range. For the matter distribution we obtain $3-\langle D_2 \rangle
< 5 \times 10^{-5}$ (2 $\sigma$) over the range $250<r<1200 \, h^{-1}$Mpc,
consistent with homogeneity on large scales.

while Yb2Ge2O7 displays an antiferromagnetically ordered Neel state at low
temperatures. While the static properties of the ytterbium pyrochlores are
distinct, inelastic neutron scattering measurements reveal a common character
to their exotic spin dynamics. All three ytterbium pyrochlores show a gapless
continuum of spin excitations, resembling over-damped ferromagnetic spin waves
at low Q. Furthermore, the specific heat of the series also follows a common
form, with a broad, high-temperature anomaly followed by a sharp
low-temperature anomaly at T_C or T_N. The novel spin dynamics we report
correlate strongly with the broad specific heat anomaly only, remaining
unchanged across the sharp anomaly. This result suggests that the primary order

maximum of the optical emission presents either a thermal component or a
spectral break. In the former case, the properties of the afterglow are then
very unusual, but could explain the lack of apparent jet breaks in the Swift
light curves. In the latter case, the afterglow properties of this burst are
more usual, and we can see in the light curves the passing through of the
injection and cooling frequencies within the optical bands, not masked by a
reverse shock. This model also excludes the presence of a stellar wind,
challenging either the stellar progenitor properties, or the very stellar

$\sqrt{s} = 1.96~\mathrm{TeV}$ using the full data set collected by the
Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) in Tevatron Run II corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of $9.1~\rm{fb}^{-1}$. The asymmetry is characterized by
the rapidity difference between top quarks and antiquarks ($\Delta y$), and
measured in the final state with two charged leptons (electrons and muons). The
inclusive asymmetry, corrected to the entire phase space at parton level, is
measured to be $A_{\text{FB}}^{t\bar{t}} = 0.12 \pm 0.13$, consistent with the
expectations from the standard-model (SM) and previous CDF results in the final
state with a single charged lepton. The combination of the CDF measurements of
the inclusive $A_{\text{FB}}^{t\bar{t}}$ in both final states yields
$A_{\text{FB}}^{t\bar{t}}=0.160\pm0.045$, which is consistent with the SM
predictions. We also measure the differential asymmetry as a function of
$\Delta y$. A linear fit to $A_{\text{FB}}^{t\bar{t}}(|\Delta y|)$, assuming
zero asymmetry at $\Delta y=0$, yields a slope of $\alpha=0.14\pm0.15$,
consistent with the SM prediction and the previous CDF determination in the
final state with a single charged lepton. The combined slope of
$A_{\text{FB}}^{t\bar{t}}(|\Delta y|)$ in the two final states is
$\alpha=0.227\pm0.057$, which is $2.0\sigma$ larger than the SM prediction.

motivated by analogies with two-dimensional regular local rings. For example,
we show that in most cases A_inf, which is manifestly not noetherian, is also

chemoradiotherapy, chemotherapeutic agents are administered along with
radiation to increase damage to the primary tumor and control systemic disease
such as metastasis. This work introduces a mathematical model to obtain optimal
drug and radiation protocols in a chemoradiotherapy scheduling problem with the
objective of minimizing metastatic cancer cell populations at multiple
potential sites while maintaining a minimum level of damage to the primary
tumor site. We derive closed-form expressions for an optimal chemotherapy
fractionation regimen. A dynamic programming framework is used to determine the
optimal radiotherapy fractionation regimen. Results show that chemotherapeutic
agents do not change the optimal radiation fractionation regimens, and
vice-versa. Interestingly, we observe that regardless of radio-sensitivity
parameters, hypo-fractionated schedules are optimal solutions for the
radiotherapy fractionation problem. Furthermore, it is optimal to immediately
start radiotherapy. However, for chemotherapy, we find that the structure of
the optimal schedule depends on model parameters such as chemotherapy-induced
cell-kill at primary and metastatic sites, as well as the ability of primary
tumor cells to initiate successful metastasis at different body sites. We
quantify the trade-off between the new and traditional objectives of minimizing
the metastatic population size and maximizing the tumor control probability,
respectively, for a cervical cancer case. The trade-off information indicates
the potential for significant reduction in the metastatic population with
minimal loss in primary tumor control.

mechanism can be used to measure the quasilocal energy in Lovelock gravity. We
have used this method in a system of M0-branes and show that the Brown-York
energy evolves in the process of birth and growth of Lovelock gravity. This can
help us to predict phenomenological events which are emerged as due to
dynamical structure of Lovelock gravity in our universe. In this model, first,
M0-branes join to each other and form an M3-brane and an anti-M3-branes
connected by an M2-brane. This system is named BIon. Universes and
anti-universes live on M3-branes and M2 plays the role of wormhole between
them. By passing time, M2 dissolves in M3's and nonlinear massive gravities,
like Lovelock massive gravity, emerges and grows. By closing M3-branes, BIon
evolves and wormhole between branes makes a transition to black hole. During
this stage, Brown-York energy increases and shrinks to large values at the
colliding points of branes. By approaching M3-branes towards each other, the
square energy of their system becomes negative and some tachyonic states are
produced. To remove these states, M3-branes compact, the sign of compacted
gravity changes, anti-gravity is created which leads to getting away of branes
from each other. Also, the Lovelock gravity disappears and it's energy forms a
new M2 between M3-branes. By getting away of branes from each other, Brown-York
energy decreases and shrinks to zero.

could be mediated by direct phonon coupling, as well as electronic coupling
with remote interfacial phonons (RIPs). To understand the relative contribution
of each component, we develop a new pump-probe technique, called
voltage-modulated thermoreflectance (VMTR), to accurately measure the change of
interfacial thermal conductance under an electrostatic field. We employed VMTR
on top gates of graphene field-effect transistors and find that the thermal
conductance of SiO2/graphene/SiO2 interfaces increases by up to {\Delta}G=0.8
MW m-2 K-1 under electrostatic fields of <0.2 V nm-1 . We propose two possible
explanations for the observed {\Delta}G. First, since the applied electrostatic
field induces charge carriers in graphene, our VMTR measurements could
originate from heat transfer between the charge carriers in graphene and RIPs
in SiO2. Second, the increase in heat conduction could be caused by better
conformity of graphene interfaces un-der electrostatic pressure exerted by the
induced charge carriers. Regardless of the origins of the observed {\Delta}G,
our VMTR measurements establish an upper limit for heat transfer from unbiased
graphene to SiO2 substrates via RIP scattering; i.e., only <2 % of the
interfacial heat transport is facilitated by RIP scattering even at a carrier
concentration of 4x10^12 cm-2.

fermions interacting with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations (spin-fermion
model). In contrast to previous works, we assume that neighboring hot spots
overlap due to a shallow dispersion of the electron spectrum in the antinodal
region and include in the consideration effects of a remnant low energy and
momentum Coulomb interaction. It turns out that this modification of the model
drastically changes the behavior of the system. The leading particle-hole
instability at not very weak fermion-fermion interaction is no longer a charge
density wave with a modulation along the diagonals of the Brillouin zone
predicted previously but a Pomeranchuk-type deformation of the Fermi surface
breaking the C$_{4}$ symmetry of the system. This order does not prevent from
further phase transitions at lower temperatures. We show that, depending on
parameters of the interaction, either d-wave superconductivity or charge
density wave with modulations along the bonds of the $CuO$ lattice is possible.
The low momentum remnant Coulomb interaction enhances the d-form factor of the
charge density wave. Comparison with experimental data allows us to conclude
that in many cuprate compounds the conditions for the proposed scenario are
indeed fulfilled. Our results may explain important features of the charge
modulations observed recently.

during its hard-soft state evolution. We use the BeppoSAX, Suzaku and RXTE
(Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer), Suzaku and BeppoSAX observations for this
investigation. We argue that the X-ray broad-band spectra during all spectral
states can be adequately reproduced by a model, consisting of a low-temperature
Blackbody component, two Comptonized components both due to the presence of a
Compton cloud (CC) that up-scatters seed photons of $T_{s1}$~< 1.4 keV, and
$T_{s2}<$1 keV, and an iron-line component. We find using this model that the
photon power-law index is almost constant, $\Gamma_{1}\sim 2$ for all spectral
states. However, $\Gamma_{2}$ shows a behavior depending on the spectral state.
Namely, $\Gamma_{2}$ is quasi-constant at the level of $\Gamma_{2}\sim 2$ while
the CC plasma temperature $kT^{(2)}_e$ is less than 40 keV; on the other hand,
$\Gamma_{2}$ is in the range of $1.3<\Gamma_{2}<2$, when $kT^{(2)}_e$ is
greater than 40 keV. We explain this quasi-stability of $\Gamma$ during most of
hard-soft transitions of 4U~1700-37 in a framework of the model in which the
resulting spectrum is described by two Comptonized components. We find that
these Comptonized spectral components of the HMXB 4U~1700-37 are similar to
those previously found in NS sources. This index dependence versus both mass
accretion rate and $kT_e$ revealed in 4U~1700-37 is a universal observational
evidence for the presence of a NS in 4U 1700-37.
