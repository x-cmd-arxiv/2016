identifying the quark or gluon nature of the initiating parton and is sensitive
to both the perturbative and non-perturbative components of fragmentation. This
paper presents a measurement of the average number of charged particles with
$p_\text{T}>500$ MeV inside high-momentum jets in dijet events using 20.3
fb$^{-1}$ of data recorded with the ATLAS detector in $pp$ collisions at
$\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV collisions at the LHC. The jets considered have transverse
momenta from 50 GeV up to and beyond 1.5 TeV. The reconstructed
charged-particle track multiplicity distribution is unfolded to remove
distortions from detector effects and the resulting charged-particle
multiplicity is compared to several models. Furthermore, quark and gluon jet
fractions are used to extract the average charged-particle multiplicity for
quark and gluon jets separately.

class in use at a given moment in the past from a random assemblage of

analytical solution is computationally impractical. Estimating the number of
artifacts in use at any time $t$ is shown to follow a Poisson distribution,
which allows for credible intervals to be established using the Jeffreys prior.
This estimator works from minimal assumptions about the dating and duration of
finds, as well as the intensity of collection, and is applied to coinage from
four Roman-period sites excavated by the Roman Peasant Project (2009-2014). The
result provides for an estimation of the abundance of material according to an

Inspired by recent theoretical advances, here we realize a colloidal version of
an artificial spin ice system using interacting polarizable particles confined
to lattices of bistable gravitational traps. We show quantitatively that
ice-selection rules emerge in this frustrated soft matter system by tuning the

independent control of particle positioning and dipolar coupling, we introduce
monopole-like defects and strings and use loops with defined chirality as an

large observational datasets, e.g. for morphological galaxy classification.
Aims. We apply ML to gravitational N-body simulations of star clusters that are
either formed by merging two progenitors or evolved in isolation, planning to
later identify Globular Clusters (GCs) that may have a history of merging from
observational data. Methods. We create mock-observations from simulated GCs,
from which we measure a set of parameters (also called features in the
machine-learning field). After dimensionality reduction on the feature space,
the resulting datapoints are fed to various classification algorithms. Using
repeated random subsampling validation we check whether the groups identified
by the algorithms correspond to the underlying physical distinction between
mergers and monolithically evolved simulations. Results. The three algorithms
we considered (C5.0 trees, k-nearest neighbour, and support-vector machines)
all achieve a test misclassification rate of about 10% without parameter
tuning, with support-vector machines slightly outperforming the others. The
first principal component of feature space correlates with cluster
concentration. If we exclude it from the regression, the performance of the
algorithms is only slightly reduced.

induced by the self-attractive nonlinearity, viz., self-trapping of the leaky

states. We use a one-dimensional mean-field model, which combines the cubic
nonlinearity and a double-well-potential (DWP) structure with an elevated
floor, which supports leaky modes (quasi-bound states) in the linear limit. The
setting can be implemented in nonlinear optics and BEC. The order in which the
SSB and self-trapping transitions take place with the growth of the
nonlinearity strength depends on the height of the central barrier of the DWP:
the SSB happens first if the barrier is relatively high, while self-trapping
comes first if the barrier is lower. The SSB of the leaky modes is
characterized by specific asymmetry of their radiation tails, which, in
addition, feature a resonant dependence on the relation between the total size
of the system and radiation wavelength. As a result of the SSB, the instability
of symmetric modes initiates spontaneous Josephson oscillations. Collisions of
freely moving solitons with the DWP structure admit trapping of an incident
soliton into a state of persistent shuttle motion, due to emission of
radiation. The study is carried out numerically, and basic results are
explained by means of analytical considerations.

problems requiring additional regularization. For example, star-convexity is

multiobject segmentation where objects could be restricted to separate
""hedgehog"" shapes. We show that a-expansion moves are submodular for our
multi-shape constraints. Each ""hedgehog"" shape has its surface normals
constrained by some vector field, e.g. gradients of a distance transform for

enforcing skeleton consistency with the scribbles. Wider cones of allowed
normals gives more relaxed hedgehog shapes. A single click and +/-90 degrees
normal orientation constraints reduce our hedgehog prior to star-convexity. If
all hedgehogs come from single clicks then our approach defines multi-star
prior. Our general method has significantly more applications than standard
one-star segmentation. For example, in medical data we can separate multiple
non-star organs with similar appearances and weak or noisy edges.

profusion of prediction studies that exploit online social and information
network data, this question remains unanswered, in part because it has not been
adequately specified. In this paper we attempt to clarify the question by
presenting a simple stylized model of success that attributes prediction error
to one of two generic sources: insufficiency of available data and/or models on
the one hand; and inherent unpredictability of complex social systems on the
other. We then use this model to motivate an illustrative empirical study of
information cascade size prediction on Twitter. Despite an unprecedented volume
of information about users, content, and past performance, our best performing
models can explain less than half of the variance in cascade sizes. In turn,
this result suggests that even with unlimited data predictive performance would
be bounded well below deterministic accuracy. Finally, we explore this
potential bound theoretically using simulations of a diffusion process on a
random scale free network similar to Twitter. We show that although higher
predictive power is possible in theory, such performance requires a homogeneous
system and perfect ex-ante knowledge of it: even a small degree of uncertainty
in estimating product quality or slight variation in quality across products
leads to substantially more restrictive bounds on predictability. We conclude
that realistic bounds on predictive accuracy are not dissimilar from those we
have obtained empirically, and that such bounds for other complex social
systems for which data is more difficult to obtain are likely even lower.

probabilities by means of the distances between every star and the cluster
central overdensity. It can handle different sets of variables, which have to
satisfy the simple condition of being more densely distributed for the cluster
members than for the field stars (as positions, proper motions, radial
velocities and/or parallaxes are). Unlike other existing techniques, this fact
makes the method more flexible and so can be easily applied to different
datasets. To quantify how the method identifies the clus- ter members, we
design series of realistic simulations recreating sky regions in both position
and proper motion subspaces populated by clusters and field stars. The re-
sults, using different simulated datasets (N = 1, 2 and 4 variables), show that
the method properly recovers a very high fraction of simulated cluster members,
with a low number of misclassified stars. To compare the goodness of our
methodology, we also run other existing algorithms on the same simulated data.
The results show that our method has a similar or even better performance than
the other techniques. We study the robustness of the new methodology from
different subsamplings of the ini- tial sample, showing a progressive
deterioration of the capability of our method as the fraction of missing
objects increases. Finally, we apply all the methodologies to the real cluster

regularization function outside the class of Sotomayor and Teixera. We then
undertake a rigorous investigation, using geometric singular perturbation
theory and blowup. We show that there is indeed a forward orbit $U$ that is
distinguished amongst all the possible forward orbits leaving the two-fold.

The proposed algorithm is suitable for vehicular communications that encounter

of the channel using least squares (LS). The temporal variation of the channel
within one OFDM symbol is approximated by two complex exponential basis
expansion models (CE-BEM). One of the Fourier-based BEMs is intended to capture
the low frequencies in the channel (slow variations corresponding to low
Doppler), while the other is destined to capture high frequencies (fast
variations corresponding to high Doppler). Kalman filtering is employed to
track the BEM coefficients iteratively on an OFDM symbol-by-symbol basis. An
interactive multiple model (IMM) estimator is implemented to dynamically mix
the estimates obtained by the two Kalman filters, each of which matched to one
of the BEMs. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to signify the gain
obtained by the proposed combining technique.

life-sciences data, Semantic Web technologies have been adopted for
standardized representations of data and linkages between data. This has
resulted in data warehouses such as UniProt, Bio2RDF, and Chem2Bio2RDF, that
integrate different kinds of biological and chemical data using ontologies.
Unfortunately, the ability to process queries over ontologically-integrated
collections remains a challenge, particularly when data is large. The reason is
that besides the traditional challenges of processing graph-structured data,
complete query answering requires inferencing to explicate implicitly
represented facts. Since traditional inferencing techniques like forward
chaining are difficult to scale up, and need to be repeated each time data is
updated, recent focus has been on inferencing that can be supported using
database technologies via query rewriting. However, due to the richness of most
biomedical ontologies relative to other domain ontologies, the queries
resulting from the query rewriting technique are often more complex than
existing query optimization techniques can cope with. This is particularly so
when using the emerging class of cloud data processing platforms for big data
processing due to some additional overhead which they introduce. In this paper,
we present an approach for dealing such complex queries on big data using
MapReduce, along with an evaluation on existing real-world datasets and
benchmark queries.

Their result establishes the scaling dependence of the threshold on the number
of vertices. We improve on their achievability bound. We also provide a
converse bound, establishing conditions under which exact recovery is
impossible. Together, these establish the scaling dependence of the threshold
on the level of correlation between the two graphs. The converse and
achievability bounds differ by a factor of two for sparse, significantly

treatment when there is unmeasured confounding and a valid instrumental
variable. A valid instrumental variable is a variable that is independent of
unmeasured confounders and affects the treatment but does not have a direct
effect on the outcome beyond its effect on the treatment. Two commonly used
estimators for using an instrumental variable to estimate a treatment effect
are the two stage least squares estimator and the control function estimator.
For linear causal effect models, these two estimators are equivalent, but for
nonlinear causal effect models, the estimators are different. We provide a
systematic comparison of these two estimators for nonlinear causal effect
models and develop an approach to combing the two estimators that generally
performs better than either one alone. We show that the control function
estimator is a two stage least squares estimator with an augmented set of
instrumental variables. If these augmented instrumental variables are valid,
then the control function estimator can be much more efficient than usual two
stage least squares without the augmented instrumental variables while if the
augmented instrumental variables are not valid, then the control function
estimator may be inconsistent while the usual two stage least squares remains
consistent. We apply the Hausman test to test whether the augmented
instrumental variables are valid and construct a pretest estimator based on
this test. The pretest estimator is shown to work well in a simulation study.

we present a new approach to this problem: using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum
defects in diamond to measure the time-dependent magnetic fields produced by
single-neuron APs. Our technique has a unique combination of features: (i) it
is noninvasive, as the light that probes the NV sensors stays within the
biocompatible diamond chip and does not enter the organism, enabling activity
monitoring over extended periods; (ii) it is label-free and should be widely
applicable to most organisms; (iii) it provides high spatial and temporal
resolution, allowing precise measurement of the AP waveforms and conduction
velocities of individual neurons; (iv) it directly determines AP propagation
direction through the inherent sensitivity of NVs to the associated AP magnetic
field vector; (v) it is applicable to neurons located within optically opaque
tissue or whole organisms, through which magnetic fields pass largely
unperturbed; and (vi) it is easy-to-use, scalable, and can be integrated with
existing techniques such as wide-field and superresolution imaging. We
demonstrate our method using excised single neurons from two invertebrate
species, marine worm and squid; and then by single-neuron AP magnetic sensing
exterior to whole, live, opaque marine worms for extended periods with no
adverse effect. The results lay the groundwork for real-time, noninvasive 3D
magnetic mapping of functional neuronal networks, ultimately with synapse-scale

School in March 2014, we explore the close connections between non-adiabatic
response of a system with respect to macroscopic parameters and the geometry of
quantum and classical states. We center our discussion around adiabatic gauge
potentials, which are the generators of unitary basis transformations in
quantum systems and generators of special canonical transformations in
classical systems. In quantum systems, eigenstate expectation values of these
potentials are the Berry connections and the covariance matrix of these gauge
potentials is the geometric tensor, whose antisymmetric part defines the Berry
curvature and whose symmetric part is the Fubini-Study metric tensor. In
classical systems one simply replaces the eigenstate expectation value by an
average over the micro-canonical shell. For complicated interacting systems, we
show that a variational principle may be used to derive approximate gauge
potentials. We then express the non-adiabatic response of the physical
observables of the system through these gauge potentials, specifically
demonstrating the close connection of the geometric tensor to the notions of
Lorentz force and renormalized mass. We highlight applications of this
formalism to deriving counter-diabatic (dissipationless) driving protocols in
various systems, as well as to finding equations of motion for slow macroscopic
parameters coupled to fast microscopic degrees of freedom that go beyond
macroscopic Hamiltonian dynamics. Finally, we illustrate these ideas with a
number of simple examples and highlight a few more complicated ones drawn from
recent literature.

unlimited memory and unlimited computational power. Yet, we assume that

either waits or transmits depending on some parameter, that is optimal when

instruments is to determine the equation of state of the matter at supranuclear
densities inside neutron stars, by measuring the radius of neutron stars with
different masses to accuracies of a few percent. Three main techniques can be
used to achieve this goal. The first involves waveform modelling. The flux we
observe from a hotspot on the neutron star surface offset from the rotational
pole will be modulated by the star's rotation, giving rise to a pulsation.
Information about mass and radius is encoded into the pulse profile via
relativistic effects, and tight constraints on mass and radius can be obtained.
The second technique involves characterising the spin distribution of accreting
neutron stars. The most rapidly rotating stars provide a very clean constraint,
since the mass-shedding limit is a function of mass and radius. However the
overall spin distribution also provides a guide to the torque mechanisms in
operation and the moment of inertia, both of which can depend sensitively on
dense matter physics. The third technique is to search for quasi-periodic
oscillations in X-ray flux associated with global seismic vibrations of
magnetars (the most highly magnetized neutron stars), triggered by magnetic
explosions. The vibrational frequencies depend on stellar parameters including
the dense matter equation of state. We illustrate how these complementary X-ray
timing techniques can be used to constrain the dense matter equation of state,
and discuss the results that might be expected from a 10m$^2$ instrument. We
also discuss how the results from such a facility would compare to other
astronomical investigations of neutron star properties. [Modified for arXiv]

sequence to measure the weak emission lines needed to apply the direct method.
All three new calibrations are reliable to within $\pm 0.10$ dex from
$\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \sim 7.5 - 10.5$ and up to at least $200~M_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$ in SFR. The N2O2 diagnostic is the least subject to systematic
biases. We apply the diagnostics to galaxies in the local universe and
investigate the $M_{\star}$-$Z$-${\rm SFR}$ relation. The N2 and O3N2
diagnostics suggest the SFR dependence of the $M_{\star}$-$Z$-${\rm SFR}$
relation varies with both $M_{\star}$ and $\Delta \log(SSFR)$, whereas the N2O2
diagnostic suggests a nearly constant dependence on SFR. We apply our
calibrations to a sample of high redshift galaxies from the literature, and
find them to be metal poor relative to local galaxies with similar $M_{\star}$

SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). The source peaked at a bolometric luminosity of
$L\simeq1.3\times10^{44}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ and radiated a total energy of
$E\simeq6.6\times10^{50}$ ergs over the first $\sim3.5$ months of observations.
The early optical/UV emission of the source can be fit by a blackbody with
temperature increasing from $T\sim2\times10^4$ K to $T\sim4\times10^4$ K while
the luminosity declines from $L\simeq1.3\times10^{44}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ to
$L\simeq2.3\times10^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$, requiring the photosphere to be
shrinking rapidly. The optical/UV luminosity decline during this period is most
consistent with an exponential decline, $L\propto e^{-(t-t_0)/\tau}$, with
$\tau \simeq46.5$ days for $t_0\simeq57241.6$ (MJD), while a power-law decline
of $L\propto (t-t_0)^{-\alpha}$ with $t_0\simeq57212.3$ and $\alpha=1.62$
provides a moderately worse fit. ASASSN-15oi also exhibits roughly constant
soft X-ray emission that is significantly weaker than the optical/UV emission.

continuum emission in early epochs, although these features fade rapidly and
are not present $\sim3$ months after discovery. The early spectroscopic
features and color evolution of ASASSN-15oi are consistent with a TDE, but the
rapid spectral evolution is unique among optically-selected TDEs.

parametrized as a dependence between the logarithm of the monochromatic
luminosity at 2500 {\AA} and at 2 keV. Previous investigations have found that
the dispersion of this relation is rather high (~0.35-0.4 in log units), which
may be caused by measurement uncertainties, variability, and intrinsic
dispersion due to differences in the AGN physical properties (e.g. different
accretion modes). We show that, once optically-selected quasars with
homogeneous SED and X-ray detection are selected, and dust reddened and/or gas
obscured objects are not included, the measured dispersion drops to
significantly lower values (i.e. ~0.21-0.24 dex). We show that the residual
dispersion is due to some extent to variability, and to remaining measurement
uncertainties. Therefore, the real physical intrinsic dispersion should be

representation of the mapping class group of the space on which the state is
defined. We show that elements of the mapping class group of a surface of genus
$g$ can be obtained through a sequence of topological charge projections along
at least three mutually intersecting non-contractible cycles. We demonstrate
this both through the algebraic theory of anyons and also through an analysis
of the topology of the space-time manifold. We combine this result with two
observations: (i) that surfaces of genus $g$ can be effectively simulated in
planar geometries by using bilayer, or doubled, versions of the topological
phase of interest, and inducing the appropriate types of gapped boundaries; and
(ii) that the required topological charge projections can be implemented as
adiabatic unitary transformations by locally tuning microscopic parameters of
the system, such as the energy gap. These observations suggest a possible path
towards effectively implementing modular transformations in physical systems.
In particular, they also show how the $\text{Ising} \otimes
\overline{\text{Ising}}$ state, in the presence of disconnected gapped
boundaries, can support universal topological quantum computation.

system associated with a wide angle tail (WAT) radio galaxy and several
intriguing substructures. The temperature across the bow shock jumps by a
factor of $\sim$ 1.5 (from 4.1 keV to 6.2 keV), and is consistent with the Mach
number $M = 1.6_{-0.3}^{+0.5}$. A second inner surface brightness edge is a
cold front that marks the border between infalling subcluster cool core and the
ICM of the main cluster. The temperature across the cold front increases from
$1.3_{-0.8}^{+0.3}$ keV to $6.2_{-0.6}^{+0.6}$ keV. We find an overpressurized
region $\sim$ 250 kpc east of the cold front that is named ""the eastern
extension (EE)"". The EE may be a part of the third subcluster in the ongoing
merger. We also find a tail shaped feature that originates near the bow shock
and may extend up to a distance of $\sim$ 1 Mpc. This feature is also likely
overpressurized. The luminous FR-I radio galaxy, 3C89, appears to be the cD
galaxy of the infalling subcluster. We estimated 3C89's jet power from jet
bending and the possible interaction between the X-ray gas and the radio lobes.
A comparison between the shock stand-off distance and the Mach number for all
known shock front/cold front combinations suggests that the core is
continuously shrinking in size by stripping.

with lower metallicities have higher SFRs at a given stellar mass and redshift,
although the scatter is large ($\approx$0.3 dex), and the trend is weaker than

agreement with models that adopt energy- and momentum-driven stellar feedback.

effects of many distinct physical processes. Observations indicate that the
$z=0$ stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation has remarkably small scatter in
stellar mass at fixed halo mass ($\lesssim$ 0.2 dex) with little dependence on
halo mass. We investigate the origins of this scatter by combining N-body
simulations with observational constraints on the SMHM relation. We find that
at the group and cluster scale ($M_{\rm vir}>10^{14}{M_\odot}$) the scatter due
purely to hierarchical assembly is $\approx0.16$ dex, which is comparable to
recent direct observational estimates. At lower masses, mass buildup since
$z\approx2$ is driven largely by in-situ growth. We include a model for the
in-situ buildup of stellar mass and find that an intrinsic scatter in this
growth channel of $0.2$ dex produces a relation between scatter and halo mass
that is consistent with observations from $10^{12}{M_\odot}<M_{\rm
vir}<10^{14.75}{M_\odot}$. The approximately constant scatter across a wide
range of halo masses at $z=0$ thus appears to be a coincidence as it is
determined largely by in-situ growth at low masses and by hierarchical assembly
at high masses. These results indicate that the scatter in the SMHM relation
can provide unique insight into the regularity of the galaxy formation process.

is not included in the current absorption models: phabs, tbabs, and tbnew. We
simulate a large number of Chandra spectra to explore the bias in the spectral
fit and NH measurements obtained without including extinction from dust
scattering. We find that without incorporating dust scattering, the measured NH
will be too large by a baseline level of 25%. This effect is modulated by the
imaging resolution of the telescope, because some amount of unresolved
scattered light will be captured within the aperture used to extract point
source information. In high resolution spectroscopy, dust scattering
significantly enhances the total extinction optical depth and the shape of the
photoelectric absorption edges. We focus in particular on the Fe-L edge at 0.7
keV, showing that the total extinction template fits well to the high
resolution spectrum of three X-ray binaries from the Chandra archive: GX 9+9,
XTE J1817-330, and Cyg X-1. In cases where dust is intrinsic to the source, a
covering factor based on the angular extent of the dusty material must be
applied to the extinction curve, regardless of angular imaging resolution. This
approach will be particularly relevant for dust in quasar absorption line
systems and might constrain clump sizes in active galactic nuclei.

connection between GC systems and galaxy's dark matter on comparable spatial
scales, using dynamical masses measured on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. Our sample
consists of 17 well-studied massive (stellar mass $\sim$10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$)
early-type galaxies from the SLUGGS survey. We find the strongest correlation
to be that of the blue (metal-poor) GC subpopulation and the dark matter
content. This correlation implies that the dark matter mass of a galaxy can be
estimated to within a factor of two from careful imaging of its GC system. The
ratio of the GC system mass to that of the enclosed dark matter is nearly
constant. We also find a strong correlation between the fraction of blue GCs
and the fraction of enclosed dark matter, so that a typical galaxy with a blue
GC fraction of 60 per cent has a dark matter fraction of 86 per cent over
similar spatial scales. Both halo growth and removal (via tidal stripping) may
play some role in shaping this trend. In the context of the two-phase model for

more complex picture emerges, in which many large cascades recur, exhibiting
multiple bursts of popularity with periods of quiescence in between. We
characterize recurrence by measuring the time elapsed between bursts, their
overlap and proximity in the social network, and the diversity in the
demographics of individuals participating in each peak. We discover that
content virality, as revealed by its initial popularity, is a main driver of
recurrence, with the availability of multiple copies of that content helping to
spark new bursts. Still, beyond a certain popularity of content, the rate of
recurrence drops as cascades start exhausting the population of interested

preparing a steady-state of quantum spins on a lattice exhibiting a discrete or

We show that for all such processes satisfying detailed balance, there exist
metastable symmetry-breaking states, i.e., states that become stationary in the
thermodynamic limit and give a finite value to the order parameter. We give
results both for discrete and continuous symmetries and explicitly show how to
construct the symmetry-breaking states. Our results show in a simple way that,

that the agent cannot short sell assets and is endowed with a strictly positive

observed from the centre of the Milky Way. Dark matter (DM) in the form of
light weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) annihilating into
electron-positron pairs has been one of the leading hypotheses of the observed

constraints from the Planck satellite on light WIMPs that were in equilibrium

unknown astrophysical or more exotic DM source of the signal.

pair-factorized steady states (PFSS) stochastic transport process are versatile
tools that lend themselves to the study of transport phenomena on a generic
level. While their mathematical structure is simple enough to allow significant
analytical treatment, they offer a variety of interesting phenomena. With
appropriate dynamics, the ZRP and PFSS models feature a condensation transition
where for a supercritical density the translational symmetry breaks
spontaneously and excess particles form a single-site or spatially extended
condensate, respectively. In this paper we numerically study the typical time
scales of the two stages of this condensation process: Nucleation and
coarsening. Nucleation is the first stage of condensation where the bulk system
relaxes to its stationary distribution and droplet nuclei form in the system.
These droplets then gradually grow or evaporate in the coarsening regime to
finally coalesce in a single condensate when the system finally relaxes to the
stationary state.
  We use the ZRP condensation model to discuss the choice of the estimation
method for the nucleation time scale and present scaling exponents for the ZRP
and PFSS condensation models with respect to the choice of the typical droplet
mass. We then proceed to present scaling exponents in the coarsening regime of
the ZRP for partial-asymmetric dynamics and the PFSS model for symmetric and
asymmetric dynamics.

reduction method that involves the projection of the data onto the subspace

can be used either for exploratory purposes or as an input for further

We compare these approximations theoretically by bounding the distance between

quality of the optical fit essentially unchanged. (2) Despite being unreliable
predictors of the UV fluxes, purely optical fits yield stellar population
properties which agree well with those obtained in optical+UV fits for nearly
90% of our sample. (3) The addition of UV constraints has little impact on
properties such as stellar mass and dust optical depth. Mean stellar ages and
metallicities also remain nearly the same for most galaxies, the exception
being low-mass, late-type galaxies, which become older and less enriched due to
rearrangements of their youngest populations. (4) The revised ages are better
correlated with observables such as the 4000 \AA\ break index, and the $NUV -

In the absence of communication noise, max estimation can be done by updating
the state value with the largest received measurements in every iteration at
each sensor. In the presence of communication noise, however, the maximum
estimate will incorrectly drift and the estimate at each sensor will diverge.
As a result, a soft-max approximation together with a non-linear consensus
algorithm is introduced herein. A design parameter controls the trade-off
between the soft-max error and convergence speed. An analysis of this trade-off
gives a guideline towards how to choose the design parameter for the max
estimate. We also show that if some prior knowledge of the initial measurements
is available, the consensus process can converge faster by using an optimal
step size in the iterative algorithm. A shifted non-linear bounded transmit
function is also introduced for faster convergence when sensor nodes have some
prior knowledge of the initial measurements. Simulation results corroborating

of evidence in document ranking. We train a word2vec embedding model on a large
unlabelled query corpus, but in contrast to how the model is commonly used, we
retain both the input and the output projections, allowing us to leverage both
the embedding spaces to derive richer distributional relationships. During
ranking we map the query words into the input space and the document words into
the output space, and compute a query-document relevance score by aggregating
the cosine similarities across all the query-document word pairs.
  We postulate that the proposed Dual Embedding Space Model (DESM) captures
evidence on whether a document is about a query term in addition to what is
modelled by traditional term-frequency based approaches. Our experiments show
that the DESM can re-rank top documents returned by a commercial Web search
engine, like Bing, better than a term-matching based signal like TF-IDF.
However, when ranking a larger set of candidate documents, we find the
embeddings-based approach is prone to false positives, retrieving documents
that are only loosely related to the query. We demonstrate that this problem
can be solved effectively by ranking based on a linear mixture of the DESM and
the word counting features.

enables reliable multi-user communication with high-order constellations in

reionization of the intergalactic medium in the presence of Lyman-limit systems

simulations, we add either a uniform or spatially-varying hydrogen bound-free
opacity. This opacity, implemented as the mean free path (mfp) of the ionizing
photons, extrapolates the observed, post-reionization redshift dependence into
the epoch of reionization. In qualitative agreement with previous studies, we
find that at late times the presence of LLSs slows down the ionization fronts,
and alters the size distribution of H II regions. We quantitatively
characterize the size distribution and morphological evolution of H II regions
and examine the effects of the LLSs on the redshifted 21-cm signal from the
patchy reionization. The presence of LLSs extends the ionization history by
$\Delta z \sim 0.8$. The LLS absorbers significantly impede the late-time
growth of the H II regions. The position dependent LLS distribution slows
reionization further and additionally limits the late growth of the ionized
regions. However, there is no ""freeze out"" of the H II regions and the largest
regions grow to the size of the simulation volume. The 21-cm power spectra show
that at large scales the power drops by a factor of 2 for 50% and 75%
ionization stages (at $k = 0.1$ $\text{h} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1} $) reflecting the
limiting effect of the LLSs on the growth of ionized patches. The statistical
observables such as the RMS of the brightness temperature fluctuations and the
peak amplitudes of the 21-cm power spectra at large-scales ($k = 0.05 - 0.1$

observations clearly detected X-ray emission associated with eta Car extending
up to ~50 keV for the first time. The NuSTAR spectrum above 10 keV can be fit
with the bremsstrahlung tail from a kT ~6 keV plasma. This temperature is Delta
kT ~2 keV higher than those measured from the iron K emission line complex, if
the shocked gas is in collisional ionization equilibrium. This result may
suggest that the companion star's pre-shock wind velocity is underestimated.
The NuSTAR observation near the X-ray minimum state showed a gradual decline in
the X-ray emission by 40% at energies above 5 keV in a day, the largest rate of
change of the X-ray flux yet observed in individual eta Car observations. The
column density to the hardest emission component, NH ~1e24 cm-2, marked one of
the highest values ever observed for eta Car, strongly suggesting increased
obscuration of the wind-wind colliding X-ray emission by the thick primary
stellar wind prior to superior conjunction. Neither observation detected the
power-law component in the extremely hard band that INTEGRAL and Suzaku
observed prior to 2011. If the non-detection by NuSTAR is caused by absorption,
the power-law source must be small and located very near the WWC apex.
Alternatively, it may be that the power-law source is not related to either eta

carriers/,cm$^{-2}$) we observe untilted peaks similar to those reported in
previous experiments. At low excitation densities (<$10^{8}$ carriers

show that tilted peak-shapes are expected in double-quantum spectra when
inhomogeneous broadening is much larger than homogeneous broadening, and that
fast pure-decoherence of the double-quantum coherence can obscure this peak
tilt. These results show that carrier interactions are important at lower

universe as it was $10^{-36}$ seconds after the Big Bang, at energy scales many
orders of magnitude larger than what the LHC can produce. However, there are
several instrumental and astrophysical sources that can obfuscate the
inflationary $B$-mode signal. One of the most difficult parameters to calibrate
for CMB telescopes is the absolute orientation of the antenna's polarization
sensitive axis. A miscalibration of the polarization orientation rotates the
much brighter $E$-mode signal, producing a false $B$-mode signal. The current
best uncertainty on polarization orientation in the CMB community is
$0.5^\circ$, set from extrapolating IRAM measurements of the Crab Nebula
supernova remnant at 90 GHz to 150 GHz, where the CMB signals peak. This
accuracy is not sufficient to convincingly detect $B$-modes predicted by
currently allowable models of Inflation. We suggest to precisely measure the
Crab Nebula's polarization, which can be calibrated absolutely to $0.1^\circ$
from measurements of the polarized emission of Mars, and use these data to
calibrate current and upcoming CMB experiments. In addition to inflationary
$B$-modes, more precise calibration will allow us to better constrain the sum
of the neutrino masses and set limits on exotic physics such as parity
violation through cosmic polarization rotation.

characterize the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of this game for a symmetric model where
the C-CSI is perfect. We show that the payoff of a primary is independent of
the C-CSI acquisition cost. We then generalize our analysis to allow for
imperfect estimation and cases where the two primaries have different C-CSI

More recently, improvements in the use of global-local shrinkage priors have

The Dirichlet-Laplace (DL) prior is adapted to linear regression. Posterior

choose the hyperparameters to minimize a discrepancy between the induced

takes into account the cooperation level of each node, reimburses the extra

groups degrades the Quality of Service (QoS) of the primary users, analytical
results are provided which present a tradeoff between maximum allowable number

simulation results in the context of LTE. The simulation results show that the
proposed solutions significantly prolong the network lifetime. Also, it is
shown that under certain circumstances, reusing uplink resource by machine

Currently, synthesis tools accept linear temporal logic (LTL) as input, but
this description is less structured and does not facilitate the expression of
sequential constraints. This motivates the use of a structured programming
language to specify synthesis problems. Transition systems and guarded commands
serve as imperative constructs, expressed in a syntax based on that of the
modeling language Promela. The syntax allows defining which player controls
data and control flow, and separating a program into assumptions and
guarantees. These notions are necessary for input to game solvers. The
integration of imperative and declarative paradigms allows using the paradigm
that is most appropriate for expressing each requirement. The declarative part
is expressed in the LTL fragment of generalized reactivity(1), which admits
efficient synthesis algorithms, extended with past LTL. The implementation
translates Promela to input for the Slugs synthesizer and is written in Python.

designed for the small-sample, high-dimensional setting. For HDRDA, we show
that each training observation, regardless of class, contributes to the class

HDRDA are computationally linear in the number of features, making the
classifier well-suited for high-dimensional classification in practice. We
demonstrate that HDRDA is often superior to several sparse and regularized
classifiers in terms of classification accuracy with three artificial and six
real high-dimensional data sets. Also, timing comparisons between our HDRDA
implementation in the sparsediscrim R package and the standard RDA formulation

suppression, which increases as the collisions become more central is
consistent with jet quenching models and is also present with comparable
magnitude at forward rapidity. At such rapidities initial state effects may
also be present and persistence of the meson suppression to high rapidity may

available and plays an important role through network cohesion, the empirically
observed phenomenon of friends behaving similarly. Taking cohesion into account
in prediction models should allow us to improve their performance. Here we
propose a network-based penalty on individual node effects to encourage
similarity between predictions for linked nodes, and show that incorporating it
into prediction leads to improvement over traditional models both theoretically
and empirically when network cohesion is present. The penalty can be used with
many loss-based prediction methods, such as regression, generalized linear
models, and Cox's proportional hazard model. Applications to predicting levels

300 K under a moderate magnetic field of $H$ = 140 kOe. At 300 K, the large MR
effect decreases as the rare-earth is traversed from Gd to Lu and the magnetic
field dependence of MR shows a deviation from the conventional $H^{2}$
behavior. The Hall coefficient ($R_{H}$) for $R$ = Gd indicates a sign change
around 120 K, whereas $R_{H}$ curves for $R$ = Dy, Tm, and Lu remain positive
for all measured temperatures. At 300 K, the Hall resistivity reveals a
deviation from the linear field dependence for all compounds. Thermoelectric
power measurements on this family show strong temperature and magnetic field
dependencies which are consistent with resistivity measurements. A highly
enhanced thermoelectric power under applied magnetic field is observed as high

categorized into one of six templates: very fast nova V1500 Cyg; fast novae

bluer nova has a less massive envelope and faster nova speed class. In novae
with multiple peaks, the track of the first decay is more red than that of the
second (or third) decay, because a large part of the envelope mass had already
been ejected during the first peak. Thus, our newly obtained tracks in the

classical novae. We also found that the absolute magnitude at the beginning of
the nebular phase is almost similar among various novae. We are able to
determine the absolute magnitude (or distance modulus) by fitting the track of

treatment on the outcome but also the underlying causal mechanism in the
presence of an intermediate variable between the treatment and outcome.
However, in many cases we cannot randomize the intermediate variable, resulting
in sample selection problems even in randomized experiments. Therefore, we view
randomized experiments with intermediate variables as semi-observational
studies. In parallel with the analysis of observational studies, we provide a
theoretical foundation for conducting objective causal inference with an
intermediate variable under the principal stratification framework, with
principal strata defined as the joint potential values of the intermediate
variable. Our strategy constructs weighted samples based on principal scores,
defined as the conditional probabilities of the latent principal strata given
covariates, without access to any outcome data. This principal stratification
analysis yields robust causal inference without relying on any model
assumptions on the outcome distributions. We also propose approaches to
conducting sensitivity analysis for violations of the ignorability and
monotonicity assumptions, the very crucial but untestable identification
assumptions in our theory. When the assumptions required by the classical
instrumental variable analysis cannot be justified by background knowledge or
cannot be made because of scientific questions of interest, our strategy serves
as a useful alternative tool to deal with intermediate variables. We illustrate
our methodologies by using two real data examples, and find scientifically
meaningful conclusions.

rare. Without addressing this issue conventional methods tend to be biased
toward the majority class with poor predictive accuracy for the minority class.
These methods further deteriorate on small, imbalanced data that has a large
degree of class overlap. In this study, we propose a novel discriminative
sparse neighbor approximation (DSNA) method to ameliorate the effect of
class-imbalance during prediction. Specifically, given a test sample, we first
traverse it through a cost-sensitive decision forest to collect a good subset
of training examples in its local neighborhood. Then we generate from this
subset several class-discriminating but overlapping clusters and model each as
an affine subspace. From these subspaces, the proposed DSNA iteratively seeks
an optimal approximation of the test sample and outputs an unbiased prediction.
We show that our method not only effectively mitigates the imbalance issue, but
also allows the prediction to extrapolate to unseen data. The latter capability
is crucial for achieving accurate prediction on small dataset with limited
samples. The proposed imbalanced learning method can be applied to both
classification and regression tasks at a wide range of imbalance levels. It
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods that do not possess an
imbalance handling mechanism, and is found to perform comparably or even better
than recent deep learning methods by using hand-crafted features only.

dwarf (UCD) galaxies and extended star clusters (ESCs), based on archival {\sl

literature, 17 X-ray counterparts with 0.5-8 keV luminosities above
$\sim$$5\times10^{36} {\rm~erg~s^{-1}}$ are identified, which are distributed
in eight early-type host galaxies. To facilitate comparison, we also identify
X-ray counterparts of 360 globular clusters (GCs) distributed in four of the
eight galaxies. The X-ray properties of the UCDs and ESCs are found to be
broadly similar to those of the GCs. The incidence rate of X-ray-detected UCDs
and ESCs, $(3.3\pm0.8)$\%, while lower than that of the X-ray-detected GCs
[($7.0\pm0.4)$\%], is substantially higher than expected from the field
populations of external galaxies. A stacking analysis of the individually
undetected UCDs/ESCs further reveals significant X-ray signals, which
corresponds to an equivalent 0.5-8 keV luminosity of $\sim$$4\times10^{35}
{\rm~erg~s^{-1}}$ per source. Taken together, these provide strong evidence
that the X-ray emission from UCDs and ESCs is dominated by low-mass X-ray
binaries having formed from stellar dynamical interactions, consistent with the
stellar populations in these dense systems being predominantly old. For the
most massive UCDs, there remains the possibility that a putative central
massive black hole gives rise to the observed X-ray emission.

modifications of the supersymmetry algebra by central and non-central charges.
Second, many theories with a sufficient amount of supersymmetry do not admit
relevant or marginal deformations, and some admit neither. The classification
is complicated by the fact that short superconformal multiplets display a rich
variety of sporadic phenomena, including supersymmetric deformations that
reside in the middle of a multiplet. We illustrate our results with examples in

concentric with the two ring-like structures at wider separations. The disk is
resolved down to $\sim$ 0\farcs{}25 and appears as an arc-like rim with
attached hook-like features. It is located at an angular separation
intermediate between that of warm CO gas identified from spatially-resolved
mid-infrared spectroscopy and diffuse dust emission recently discovered with
the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope}. The inner disk has a radius of $\sim$ 39
AU, a position angle consistent with north-up, an inclination of $i$ $\sim$
56$^{o}$, and has a center offset from the star. Forward-modeling of the disk
favors a thick torus-like emission sharply truncated at separations beyond the
torus' photocenter and heavily depleted at smaller separations. In particular,
the best-fit density power law for the dust suggests that the inner disk dust
and gas (as probed by CO) are radially segregated, a feature consistent with
the dust trapping mechanism inferred from observations of ""canonical""
transitional disks. However, the inner disk component may instead be explained
by radiation pressure-induced migration in optically-thin conditions, in
contrast to the two stellar companion/planet-influenced ring-like structures at
wider separations. HD 141569A's circumstellar environment --- with three
nested, gapped, concentric dust populations --- is an excellent laboratory for
understanding the relationship between planet formation and the evolution of
both dust grains and disk architecture.

The energy production heavily depends on the mechanical power (i.e. the product
of rotational speed and generator torque). However, since torque sensors in the
MW range are not available or extremely expensive, the torque controllers are
implemented as feedforward controllers and, therefore, are inherently sensitive
to parameter variations/uncertainties. Based on real wind data and a dynamical

percent of the total development costs of a software system in practice. Test
automation is proposed to lower these V&V costs but available research only
provides limited empirical data from industrial practice about the maintenance
costs of automated tests and what factors affect these costs. In particular,
these costs and factors are unknown for automated GUI-based testing.
  Objective: This paper addresses this lack of knowledge through analysis of
the costs and factors associated with the maintenance of automated GUI-based
tests in industrial practice.
  Method: An empirical study at two companies, Siemens and Saab, is reported
where interviews about, and empirical work with, Visual GUI Testing is
performed to acquire data about the technique's maintenance costs and
feasibility.
  Results: 13 factors are observed that affect maintenance, e.g. tester
knowledge/experience and test case complexity. Further, statistical analysis
shows that developing new test scripts is costlier than maintenance but also
that frequent maintenance is less costly than infrequent, big bang maintenance.
In addition a cost model, based on previous work, is presented that estimates
the time to positive return on investment (ROI) of test automation compared to
manual testing.
  Conclusions: It is concluded that test automation can lower overall software
development costs of a project whilst also having positive effects on software
quality. However, maintenance costs can still be considerable and the less time
a company currently spends on manual testing, the more time is required before
positive, economic, ROI is reached after automation.

1.34 km s$^{-1}$ for a $V = 10.2$ mag eclipsing binary. Radial velocity

problem at critical angle and find, for Gaussian beams, a closed formula in
terms of modified Bessel functions of the first kind. The formula is in

angles greater than critical ones, the Artmann formula. The closed form also

Consequently, people tend to express their feelings freely, which makes Twitter
an ideal source for accumulating a vast amount of opinions towards a wide
diversity of topics. This amount of information offers huge potential and can
be harnessed to receive the sentiment tendency towards these topics. However,
since none can invest an infinite amount of time to read through these tweets,
an automated decision making approach is necessary. Nevertheless, most existing
solutions are limited in centralized environments only. Thus, they can only
process at most a few thousand tweets. Such a sample, is not representative to
define the sentiment polarity towards a topic due to the massive number of
tweets published daily. In this paper, we go one step further and develop a
novel method for sentiment learning in the MapReduce framework. Our algorithm
exploits the hashtags and emoticons inside a tweet, as sentiment labels, and
proceeds to a classification procedure of diverse sentiment types in a parallel

storage size of intermediate data and boost the performance of our algorithm.
Through an extensive experimental evaluation, we prove that our solution is

holes in $f(R)$ gravity is drawn in this paper. Firstly, we investigate the
phase transition in canonical ensemble. We derive the explicit solutions
corresponding to the divergence of $C_Q$. The two solutions merge into one when
the condition $Q_c=\sqrt{\frac{-1}{3R_0}}$ is satisfied. The curve of specific
heat for $Q<Q_c$ has two divergent points and can be divided into three
regions. Both the large radius region and the small radius region are
thermodynamically stable with positive specific heat while the medium radius
region is unstable with negative specific heat. However, when $Q>Q_c$, the
specific heat is always positive, implying the black holes are locally stable
and no phase transition will take place. Secondly, both the $T-r_+$ curve and
$T-S$ curve $f(R)$ AdS black holes are investigated and they exhibit Van der
Vaals like behavior as the $P-v$ curve in the former research. Critical
physical quantities are obtained and they are consistent with those derived
from the specific heat analysis. We carry out numerical check of Maxwell equal
area law for the cases $Q=0.2Q_c, 0.4Q_c, 0.6Q_c, 0.8Q_c$. The relative errors
are amazingly small and can be negligible. So the Maxwell equal area law holds
for $T-S$ curve of $f(R)$ black holes. Thirdly, we establish
geometrothermodynamics for $f(R)$ AdS black hole to examine the phase
structure. It is shown that the Legendre invariant scalar curvature
$\mathfrak{R}$ would diverge exactly where the specific heat diverges. To
summarize, the above three perspectives are consistent with each other, thus
providing a unified picture which deepens the understanding of critical
phenomena of $f(R)$ AdS black holes.

segmentation for a data set as the one which minimises a penalised cost
function, with the cost function defined in term of minus a non-parametric
log-likelihood for data within each segment. Min- imising this cost function is
possible using dynamic programming, but their algorithm had a computational
cost that is cubic in the length of the data set. To speed up computation, Zou
et al. (2014) resorted to a screening procedure which means that the estimated
segmentation is no longer guaranteed to be the global minimum of the cost
function. We show that the screening procedure adversely affects the accuracy
of the changepoint detection method, and show how a faster dynamic programming
algorithm, Pruned Exact Linear Time, PELT (Killick et al., 2012), can be used
to find the optimal segmentation with a computational cost that can be close to
linear in the amount of data. PELT requires a penalty to avoid
under/over-fitting the model which can have a detrimental effect on the quality
of the detected changepoints. To overcome this issue we use a relatively new
method, Changepoints Over a Range of PenaltieS (CROPS) (Haynes et al., 2015),
which finds all of the optimal segmentations for multiple penalty values over a
continuous range. We apply our method to detect changes in heart rate during

objects and patterns depicted, and image scales, hampers CNN training and
performance, because the task-relevant information varies over spatial scales.
Previous work attempting to deal with such scale variations focused on
encouraging scale-invariant CNN representations. However, scale-invariant
representations are incomplete representations of images, because images
contain scale-variant information as well. This paper addresses the combined
development of scale-invariant and scale-variant representations. We propose a
multi- scale CNN method to encourage the recognition of both types of features
and evaluate it on a challenging image classification task involving
task-relevant characteristics at multiple scales. The results show that our
multi-scale CNN outperforms single-scale CNN. This leads to the conclusion that
encouraging the combined development of a scale-invariant and scale-variant
representation in CNNs is beneficial to image recognition performance.

two-dimensional soft matter system is studied. The behaviour when confined
within a wedge is also considered. The system consists of particles interacting
via a soft purely repulsive pair potential. Density functional theory (DFT) is
used to calculate density profiles and thermodynamic quantities. The external
potential due to the confining walls is modelled via a hard-wall with an
additional repulsive Yukawa potential. The surface phase behaviour depends on
the range and strength of this repulsion: When the repulsion strength is weak,
the wall promotes freezing at the surface of the wall. The thickness of this
frozen layer grows logarithmically as the bulk liquid-solid phase coexistence
is approached. Our mean-field DFT predicts that this crystalline layer at the
wall must be nucleated (i.e. there is a free energy barrier) and its formation
is necessarily a first-order transition, referred to as `prefreezing', by
analogy with the prewetting transition. However, in contrast to the latter,
prefreezing cannot terminate in a critical point, since the phase transition
involves a change in symmetry. If the wall-fluid interaction is sufficiently
long ranged and the repulsion is strong enough, surface melting can instead
occur. Then the interface between the wall and the bulk crystalline solid
becomes wet by the liquid phase as the chemical potential is decreased towards
the value at liquid-solid coexistence. It is observed that the finite thickness
fluid film at the wall has a broken translational symmetry due to its proximity
to the bulk crystal and so the nucleation of the wetting film can be either
first-order or continuous. Our mean-field theory predicts that for certain wall
potentials there is a premelting critical point analogous to the surface

The simulations are carried out under idealized conditions to focus on the

temperatures in the southern high latitudes decrease and snow accumulates
constantly. Moreover, the relative importance of each possible forcing is

southern polar continent. The change induced by the orbital parameters depends
strongly on the magnitude of the change in obliquity.

The derivation, reminiscent of slender-body theory for filaments, assumes that
the length of the ribbon is much larger than its width, which itself is much
larger than its thickness. The final result is an integral equation for the
force density on a mathematical ruled surface, termed the ribbon plane, located

identical single photons on demand, capable of integration into solid-state
devices. It has been proposed that such molecules in a crystalline organic
matrix might be placed close to an optical waveguide for this purpose, but so
far there have been no demonstrations of sufficiently thin crystals, with a
controlled concentration of suitable dopant molecules. Here we present a method
for growing very thin anthracene crystals from super-saturated vapour, which
produces crystals of extreme flatness and controlled thickness. We show how
this crystal can be doped with a widely adjustable concentration of
dibenzoterrylene (DBT) molecules and we examine the optical properties of these
molecules to demonstrate their suitability as quantum emitters in nanophotonic
devices. Our measurements show that the molecules are available in the crystal
as single quantum emitters, with a well-defined polarisation relative to the
crystal axes, making them amenable to alignment with optical nanostructures. We
find that the radiative lifetime and saturation intensity vary little within
the crystal and are not in any way compromised by the unusual matrix
environment. We show that a large fraction of these emitters are able to
deliver more than $10^{12}$ photons without photo-bleaching, making them
suitable for real applications.

nanoscience and condensed matter physics. Different to usual fermions, Majorana
fermions have the property that the particle is its own anti-particle thus,
they must be described by real fields. Mathematically, this property makes
nontrivial the quantization of the problem due, for instance, to the absence of
a Wick-like theorem. In view of the present interest on the subject, it is
important to develop different theoretical approaches in order to study
problems where Majorana fermions are involved. In this note we show that
Majorana fermions can be studied in the context of field theories for
constrained systems. Using the Faddeev-Jackiw formalism for quantum field
theories with constraints, we derived the path integral representation for
Majorana fermions. In order to show the validity of the path integral we apply
it to an exactly solvable problem. This application also shows that it is
rather simple to perform systematic calculations on the basis of the present
framework.

becomes effectively classical, due to the rapid decay of quantum superpositions

the stochastic dynamics that emerges in that limit, revealing several
interesting features, including kinetically-constrained glassy behaviour,
self-similarity and aggregation effects. However, the non-equilibrium physics
of these systems, in particular in the regime where coherent and dissipative
processes contribute on equal footing, is yet far from being understood. To
explore this we study the dynamics of a small one-dimensional Rydberg lattice
gas subject to dephasing noise by numerically integrating the quantum Master
equation. We interpolate between the coherent and the strongly dephased regime
by defining a generalised concept of a blockade length. We find indications
that the main features observed in the strongly dissipative limit persist when
the dissipation is not strong enough to annihilate quantum coherences at the
dynamically relevant time scales. These features include the existence of a
time-dependent Rydberg blockade radius, and a growth of the density of
excitations which is compatible with the power-law behaviour expected in the
classical limit.

Zet1 Ret - Zet2 Ret, to determine whether there is a depletion of refractories,
which could be related to the planet formation process. The star Zet2 Ret hosts
a debris disk which was detected by an IR excess and confirmed by direct
imaging and numerical simulations, while Zet1 Ret does not present IR excess
nor planets. We carried out a high-precision abundance determination in both
components of the binary system via a line-by-line, strictly differential
approach. The stellar parameters Teff , log g, [Fe/H] and vturb were determined
by imposing differential ionization and excitation equilibrium of Fe I and Fe
II lines, with an updated version of the program FUNDPAR. The star Zet1 Ret
resulted slightly more metal rich than Zet2 Ret by 0.02 dex. In the
differential calculation of Zet1 Ret using Zet2 Ret as reference, the
abundances of the refractory elements resulted higher than the volatile
elements, and the trend of the refractory elements with Tc showed a positive
slope. These facts together show a lack of refractory elements in Zet2 Ret (a
debris-disk host) relative to Zet1 Ret. The Tc trend would be in agreement with
the proposed signature of planet formation (Melendez et al. 2009) rather than
possible Galactic Chemical Evolution or age effects, which are largely
diminished here. Then, following the interpretation of Melendez et al. (2009),
we propose an scenario in which the refractory elements depleted in Zet2 Ret
are possibly locked-up in the rocky material that orbits this star and produce
the debris disk observed around this object. We estimated a lower limit of
Mrock = 3 Me for the rocky mass of depleted material, which is compatible with
a rough estimation of 3-50 Me of a debris disk mass around a solar-type star
(Krivov et al. 2008). (abridged)

relatively little damping) and a modified momentum parameter which is a

phenomenological hydrodynamic Bohr-Davydov-Faessler-Greiner (BDFG) model for

derivation is not limited to small oscillation amplitudes. The model
generalizes the author's previous model to include interaction between
collective oscillations in each pair of spatial directions, and to remove many
of the previous-model approximations. To derive the model, the nuclear
Schrodinger equation is canonically transformed to collective coordinates and
then linearized using a constrained variational method. The associated
transformation constraints are imposed on the wavefunction and not on the
particle co-ordinates. This approach yields four self-consistent, time-reversal
invariant, cranking-type Schrodinger equations for the rotation-vibration and
intrinsic motions, and a self-consistency equation. To facilitate comparison
with the BDFG model, simplify the solution of the equations, and gain physical
insight, we restrict in this article the collective oscillations to only two
space dimensions. For harmonic oscillator mean-field potentials, the equations
are then solved in closed forms and applied to the ground-state rotational
bands in some even-even light and rare-earth nuclei. The computed ground-state
rotational band excitation energy, quadrupole moment and electric quadrupole

successful mutations are assumed to fix instantaneously (leading to an adaptive

adaptation is impossible) if the rate of environmental change v exceeds a
parameter m, which can be interpreted as the rate of adaptation in case every
beneficial mutation gets fixed with probability 1. If v < m, the process is

one can express the complete scalar potential in terms of a superpotential and

to be driven by Hamilton's characteristic function in the Hamilton-Jacobi

equations to a symplectically covariant form. Moreover, by rotating the charges

beyond the weak coupling and Markovian approximation, which is different in
spirit from conventional approaches. The idea is to redefine the system and
environment such that the effective, redefined system is again coupled weakly
to Markovian residual baths and thus, allows to derive a consistent
thermodynamic framework for this new system-environment partition. To achieve
this goal we make use of the reaction coordinate mapping, which is a general
method in the sense that it can be applied to an arbitrary (quantum or
classical and even time-dependent) system coupled linearly to an arbitrary
number of harmonic oscillator reservoirs. The core of the method relies on an
appropriate identification of a part of the environment (the reaction
coordinate), which is subsequently included as a part of the system. We
demonstrate the power of this concept by showing that non-Markovian effects can
significantly enhance the steady state efficiency of a three-level-maser heat
engine, even in the regime of weak system-bath coupling. Furthermore, we show
for a single electron transistor coupled to vibrations that our method allows

each node has one of $k$ opinions. The nodes execute a (randomized) distributed
protocol to agree on the plurality opinion (the opinion initially supported by
the most nodes). Nodes in such networks are often quite cheap and simple, and
hence one seeks protocols that are not only fast but also simple and space
efficient. Typically, protocols depend heavily on the employed communication
mechanism, which ranges from sequential (only one pair of nodes communicates at
any time) to fully parallel (all nodes communicate with all their neighbors at
once) communication and everything in-between.
  We propose a framework to design protocols for a multitude of communication
mechanisms. We introduce protocols that solve the plurality consensus problem
and are with probability 1-o(1) both time and space efficient. Our protocols
are based on an interesting relationship between plurality consensus and
distributed load balancing. This relationship allows us to design protocols
that generalize the state of the art for a large range of problem parameters.
In particular, we obtain the same bounds as the recent result of Alistarh et
al. (who consider only two opinions on a clique) using a much simpler protocol
that generalizes naturally to general graphs and multiple opinions.

scientific knowledge, often encoded in physical models that require numerical
approximation. Statistical prediction, and subsequent optimization, is key to
ensuring the process output meets a specification target. However, the
numerical expense of approximating the models poses computational challenges to
the identification of combinations of the process factors where there is
confidence in the quality of the response. Recent work in Bayesian computation
and statistical approximation (emulation) of expensive computational models is
exploited to develop a novel strategy for optimizing the posterior probability
of a process meeting specification. The ensuing methodology is motivated by,
and demonstrated on, a chemical synthesis process to manufacture a
pharmaceutical product, within which an initial set of substances evolve
according to chemical reactions, under certain process conditions, into a
series of new substances. One of these substances is a target pharmaceutical
product and two are unwanted by-products. The aim is to determine the
combinations of process conditions and amounts of initial substances that
maximize the probability of obtaining sufficient target pharmaceutical product
whilst ensuring unwanted by-products do not exceed a given level. The
relationship between the factors and amounts of substances of interest is
theoretically described by the solution to a system of ordinary differential
equations incorporating temperature dependence. Using data from a small
experiment, it is shown how the methodology can approximate the multivariate
posterior predictive distribution of the pharmaceutical target and by-products,
and therefore identify suitable operating values. Materials to replicate the

concurrent execution of thousands of threads. Unfortunately, different
bottlenecks during execution and heterogeneous application requirements create
imbalances in utilization of resources in the cores. For example, when a GPU is
bottlenecked by the available off-chip memory bandwidth, its computational
resources are often overwhelmingly idle, waiting for data from memory to
arrive.
  This work describes the Core-Assisted Bottleneck Acceleration (CABA)
framework that employs idle on-chip resources to alleviate different
bottlenecks in GPU execution. CABA provides flexible mechanisms to
automatically generate ""assist warps"" that execute on GPU cores to perform
specific tasks that can improve GPU performance and efficiency.
  CABA enables the use of idle computational units and pipelines to alleviate
the memory bandwidth bottleneck, e.g., by using assist warps to perform data
compression to transfer less data from memory. Conversely, the same framework
can be employed to handle cases where the GPU is bottlenecked by the available
computational units, in which case the memory pipelines are idle and can be
used by CABA to speed up computation, e.g., by performing memoization using
assist warps.
  We provide a comprehensive design and evaluation of CABA to perform effective
and flexible data compression in the GPU memory hierarchy to alleviate the
memory bandwidth bottleneck. Our extensive evaluations show that CABA, when
used to implement data compression, provides an average performance improvement
of 41.7% (as high as 2.6X) across a variety of memory-bandwidth-sensitive GPGPU
applications.

($Z$) probes. The spectral models of Dessart et al. (2014) showed that the
pseudo-equivalent width of Fe II $\lambda$5018 (pEW$_{5018}$) during the
plateau phase depends on the primordial $Z$, but there was a paucity of SNe IIP
exhibiting pEW$_{5018}$ that were compatible with $Z < 0.4$ ${\rm Z}_{\odot}$.
This lack might be due to some physical property of the SN II population or to
the fact that those SNe have been discovered in luminous, metal-rich targeted
galaxies. Here we use SN II observations from the untargeted (intermediate)
Palomar Transient Factory [(i)PTF] survey, aiming to investigate the
pEW$_{5018}$ distribution of this SN population and, in particular, to look for
the presence of SNe II at lower $Z$. We perform pEW$_{5018}$ measurements on
the spectra of a sample of 39 (i)PTF SNe II, selected to have well-constrained
explosion epochs and light-curve properties. Based on the comparison with the
pEW$_{5018}$ spectral models, we subgrouped our SNe into four $Z$ bins from $Z
\approx 0.1$ $Z_{\odot}$ up to $Z \approx 2$ $Z_{\odot}$. We also independently
investigated the $Z$ of the hosts by using their absolute magnitudes and colors
and, in a few cases, using strong-line diagnostics from spectra. We searched
for possible correlations between SN observables, such as their peak magnitudes
and the $Z$ inferred from pEW$_{5018}$. We found 11 events with pEW$_{5018}$
that were small enough to indicate $Z \approx 0.1$ $Z_{\odot}$. The trend of
pEW$_{5018}$ with $Z$ matches the $Z$ estimates obtained from the host-galaxy
photometry, although the significance of the correlation is weak. We also found
that SNe with brighter peak magnitudes have smaller pEW$_{5018}$ and occur at
lower $Z$.

emitted by a more distant object such as a quasar. Strong gravitational lensing
causes multiple images of the same quasar to appear in the sky. Since the light
in each gravitationally lensed image traverses a different path length from the
quasar to the Earth, fluctuations in the source brightness are observed in the
several images at different times. The time delay between these fluctuations
can be used to constrain cosmological parameters and can be inferred from the
time series of brightness data or light curves of each image. To estimate the
time delay, we construct a model based on a state-space representation for
irregularly observed time series generated by a latent continuous-time
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We account for microlensing, an additional source
of independent long-term extrinsic variability, via a polynomial regression.
Our Bayesian strategy adopts a Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs sampler. We
improve the sampler by using an ancillarity-sufficiency interweaving strategy
and adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo. We introduce a profile likelihood of the
time delay as an approximation of its marginal posterior distribution. The
Bayesian and profile likelihood approaches complement each other, producing
almost identical results; the Bayesian method is more principled but the
profile likelihood is simpler to implement. We demonstrate our estimation
strategy using simulated data of doubly- and quadruply-lensed quasars, and
observed data from quasars Q0957+561 and J1029+2623.

chemical sensing, like e.g. environmental monitoring, or chemically-guided
robot navigation. If an estimation of the gas concentration at the source is
available, source proximity can be estimated from the time-averaged gas
concentration at the sensing site. However, in turbulent environments, where
fast concentration fluctuations dominate, comparably long measurements are
required to obtain a reliable estimate. A lesser known feature that can be
exploited for distance estimation in a turbulent environment lies in the
relationship between source proximity and the temporal variance of the local
gas concentration - the farther the source, the more intermittent are gas
encounters. However, exploiting this feature requires measurement of changes in
gas concentration on a comparably fast time scale, that have up to now only
been achieved using photo-ionisation detectors. Here, we demonstrate that by
appropriate signal processing, off-the-shelf metal-oxide sensors are capable of
extracting rapidly fluctuating features of gas plumes that strongly correlate
with source distance. We show that with a straightforward analysis method it is
possible to decode events of large, consistent changes in the measured signal,
so-called 'bouts'. The frequency of these bouts predicts the distance of a gas
source in wind-tunnel experiments with good accuracy. In addition, we found
that the variance of bout counts indicates cross-wind offset to the centreline
of the gas plume. Our results offer an alternative approach to estimating gas
source proximity that is largely independent of gas concentration, using
off-the-shelf metal-oxide sensors. The analysis method we employ demands very
few computational resources and is suitable for low-power microcontrollers.

has three simple conclusions. The first is that spreadsheet errors are rare on
a per-cell basis, but in large programs, at least one incorrect bottom-line
value is very likely to be present. The second is that errors are extremely
difficult to detect and correct. The third is that spreadsheet developers and
corporations are highly overconfident in the accuracy of their spreadsheets.
The disconnect between the first two conclusions and the third appears to be
due to the way human cognition works. Most importantly, we are aware of very
few of the errors we make. In addition, while we are proudly aware of errors
that we fix, we have no idea of how many remain, but like Little Jack Horner we
are impressed with our ability to ferret out errors. This paper reviews human
cognition processes and shows first that humans cannot be error free no matter
how hard they try, and second that our intuition about errors and how we can
reduce them is based on appallingly bad knowledge. This paper argues that we
should reject any prescription for reducing errors that has not been rigorously
proven safe and effective. This paper also argues that our biggest need, based
on empirical data, is to do massively more testing than we do now. It suggests
that the code inspection methodology developed in software development is
likely to apply very well to spreadsheet inspection.

  a mixed society of animals and robots","13 pages, 6 figures",,"10.1007/978-3-319-63537-8_10",,"nlin.AO cs.MA cs.RO q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Animal and robotic collective behaviours can exhibit complex dynamics that
require multi-level descriptions. Here, we are interested in developing a
multi-level modeling framework for the use of robots in studies about animal
collective decision-making. In this context, using robots can be useful for
validating models in silico, inducing calibrated repetitive stimuli to trigger
animal responses or modulating and controlling animal collective behaviour.
However, designing appropriate biomimetic robotic behaviour faces a major
challenge: how to go from the collective decision dynamics observed with
animals to an actual algorithmic implementation in robots. In previous work,
this was mainly done by hand, often by taking inspiration from human-designed
models. Typically, models of behaviour are either macroscopic, differential
equations of the population dynamics, or microscopic,explicit spatio-temporal
state of each individual. Only microscopic models can easily be implemented as
robot controllers. Here, we address the problem of automating the design of
lower level description models that can be implemented in robots and exhibit
the same collective dynamics as a given higher level model. We apply
evolutionary algorithms to simultaneously optimise the parameters of models
accounting for different levels of description. This methodology is applied to
an experimentally validated shelter-selection problem solved by gregarious
insects and robots. We successfully design and calibrate automatically both a
microscopic and a hybrid model exhibiting the same dynamics as a macroscopic
one. Our framework can be used for multi-level modeling of collective behaviour
in animal or robot populations and bio-hybrid systems.

propagating through a mixture of a gas of atoms or molecules and a plasma. For
a specific range of radiation and plasma frequencies, resonant generation of
volume plasmons significantly amplifies the radiation intensity. The conditions
for resonant amplification are derived from the dispersion relations in the
mixture, and the amplification is demonstrated in a numerical simulation of
pulse propagation.

sun was rising and setting on each day of the year. A discussion for the
Menkaure pyramid is also proposed.

comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko that was observed repeatedly in several nucleus
rotations starting on May 30 and persisting until early August, 2015. We
simulated the motion of dust grains ejected from the nucleus surface under the
influence of the gravity and viscous drag effect of the expanding gas flow from
the rotating nucleus. The formation of the curved jet is a combination of the
size of the dust particles (~0.1-1 mm) and the location of the source region
near the nucleus equator. This enhances the spiral feature of the collimated
dust stream after the dust is accelerated to a terminal speed on the order of
m/s.
