distributions and subjected to stretch and pressure oscillations are
investigated numerically using an implicit method which couples the fully
compressible flow to the realistic chemistry and multicomponent transport
properties. The impact of increasing {\em negative} stretch is investigated
through the use of planar, cylindrical and spherical geometries, and a
comparison with the results from {\em positively} stretched expanding H2/air
flames (MALIK2010) and CH4/air flames (MALIK2012a) is made. A flame relaxation
number $n_R=\tau_R/\tau_L$ ($\tau_R$ is the time that the flame takes to return
to the mean equilibrium conditions after initial disturbance; $\tau_L$ is a
flame time scale) decreases by 10\% with increasing {\em negative} stretch, in
contrast to the two expanding flames where $n_R$ decreased by 40\% with
increasing {\em positive} stretch. $n_R$ appears to much more sensitive to
variations in positive/negative curvature than to the thermo-chemistry of
different flame types. $n_R$ may thus be a useful indicator of the strength of
flame-curvature coupling. The spectra of pressure fluctuations $E_p(\omega)$
scale close to $\sim\omega^{-3}$, which is steeper than in the expanding H2/air
flames where $E_p(\omega)\sim\omega^{-2}$. Rapid transport ('flapping') of the
flame front by the largest convective velocities induced by the random pressure
fluctuations is prominent because of the lack of gas velocity ahead of the
flame, $u_g=0$. 'Memory effects' between fuel consumption and the rate of heat
release is obscured by the flapping, although the contracting flames display
short time-lags in the mean.

two different \textit{ab initio} approaches: 1) based on all-electron
full-potential linearized-augmented plane-wave method and 2) local basis
function pseudopotential approach. Agreement is found between the two methods
for small and intermediate sized clusters for which the former method is
limited due to its all-electron formulation. The latter, due to non-periodic
boundary conditions, is the more natural approach to simulate small clusters.
The effect of cluster size is then explored using the local basis function

undergoes a transition from molecular behavior to nanoparticle behavior at a
cluster size of 140 atoms (diameter $\sim 1.7$\,nm). Above this cluster size
the step-like electronic structure, evident as several features in the
imaginary part of the polarizability of all clusters smaller than
Ag$_\mathrm{147}$, gives way to a dominant plasmon peak localized at

emerging in a large asexual mutator population is analytically calculated here.
The mutator population undergoes deleterious mutations at constant, but at a
much higher rate than that of the non-mutator. We find that antagonistic
epistasis lowers the chances of mutation rate reduction, while synergistic
epistasis enhances it. Below a critical value of epistasis, the fixation
probability behaves non-monotonically with variation in mutation rate of the
background population. Moreover, the variation of this critical value of the
epistasis parameter with the strength of the mutator is discussed in the
Appendix. For synergistic epistasis, when selection is varied, the fixation

with known lower bounds depending exponentially in dimension. A popular
strategy to alleviate this curse of dimensionality has been to use additive
models of \emph{first order}, which model the regression function as a sum of
independent functions on each dimension. Though useful in controlling the
variance of the estimate, such models are often too restrictive in practical
settings. Between non-additive models which often have large variance and first
order additive models which have large bias, there has been little work to
exploit the trade-off in the middle via additive models of intermediate order.
In this work, we propose SALSA, which bridges this gap by allowing interactions
between variables, but controls model capacity by limiting the order of
interactions. SALSA minimises the residual sum of squares with squared RKHS
norm penalties. Algorithmically, it can be viewed as Kernel Ridge Regression
with an additive kernel. When the regression function is additive, the excess
risk is only polynomial in dimension. Using the Girard-Newton formulae, we
efficiently sum over a combinatorial number of terms in the additive expansion.
Via a comparison on $15$ real datasets, we show that our method is competitive
against $21$ other alternatives.

entire CA rule space is addressed by means of a universal map for CAs that we
have recently derived and that is not dependent on any freely adjustable
parameters. The CMLs thus constructed are termed real-valued deterministic
cellular automata (RDCA) and encompass all deterministic CAs in rule space in
the asymptotic limit $\kappa \to 0$ of a continuous parameter $\kappa$. Thus,
RDCAs generalize CAs in such a way that they constitute CMLs when $\kappa$ is
finite and nonvanishing. In the limit $\kappa \to \infty$ all RDCAs are shown
to exhibit a global homogeneous fixed-point that attracts all initial
conditions. A new bifurcation is discovered for RDCAs and its location is
exactly determined from the linear stability analysis of the global quiescent
state. In this bifurcation, fuzziness gradually begins to intrude in a purely
deterministic CA-like dynamics. The mathematical method presented allows to get
insight in some highly nontrivial behavior found after the bifurcation.

E$ be an edge. The distance between the vertex $v$ and the edge $e$ is given by
$d_G(e,v)=\min\{d_G(u,v),d_G(w,v)\}$. A vertex $w\in V$ distinguishes two edges
$e_1,e_2\in E$ if $d_G(w,e_1)\ne d_G(w,e_2)$. A set $S$ of vertices in a
connected graph $G$ is an edge metric generator for $G$ if every two edges of
$G$ are distinguished by some vertex of $S$. The smallest cardinality of an
edge metric generator for $G$ is called the edge metric dimension and is
denoted by $edim(G)$. In this article we introduce the concept of edge metric
dimension and initiate the study of its mathematical properties. We make a
comparison between the edge metric dimension and the standard metric dimension
of graphs while presenting some realization results concerning the edge metric
dimension and the standard metric dimension of graphs. We prove that computing
the edge metric dimension of connected graphs is NP-hard and give some
approximation results. Moreover, we present some bounds and closed formulae for
the edge metric dimension of several classes of graphs.

information on the heat conductivity of the complex mixture of minerals and

conductivity of a multi-component mineral mixture and granular medium from the
heat conductivities of its mixture components. Random mixtures of solids with
chondritic composition and packings of spheres are numerically generated. The
heat conduction equation is solved in high spatial resolution for a test cube
filled with such matter. From the heat flux through the cube the heat
conductivity of the mixture is derived. The model results for porous material
are consistent with data for compacted sandstone, but are at odds with
measurements for H and L chondrites. The discrepancy is traced back to shock
modification of the currently available meteoritic material by impacts on the
parent body over the last 4.5 Ga. This causes numerous micro-cracks that act as
additional barriers for heat transfer. The void structure in meteorites is
different from that which probably existed in the pristine material of the
parent bodies. The results obtained for the heat conductivity of the pristine
material are used for calculating models for the evolution of the H chondrite
parent body which are fitted to the cooling data of a number of H chondrites.
The fit to the data good.

diamagnetism at thermal equilibrium within classical electromagnetic theory.
The analysis requires that relativistic electromagnetism is joined

nonrelativistic classical statistical mechanics is applied only in the

transfer information from the APOGEE survey to determine precise Teff, log g,
[Fe/H], and [$\alpha$/M] from the spectra of 450,000 LAMOST giants. The Cannon
fits a predictive model for LAMOST spectra using 9952 stars observed in common
between the two surveys, taking five labels from APOGEE DR12 as ground truth:
Teff, log g, [Fe/H], [\alpha/M], and K-band extinction $A_k$. The model is then
used to infer Teff, log g, [Fe/H], and [$\alpha$/M] for 454,180 giants, 20% of
the LAMOST DR2 stellar sample. These are the first [$\alpha$/M] values for the
full set of LAMOST giants, and the largest catalog of [$\alpha$/M] for giant
stars to date. Furthermore, these labels are by construction on the APOGEE
label scale; for spectra with S/N > 50, cross-validation of the model yields
typical uncertainties of 70K in Teff, 0.1 in log g, 0.1 in [Fe/H], and 0.04 in
[$\alpha$/M], values comparable to the broadly stated, conservative APOGEE DR12
uncertainties. Thus, by using ""label transfer"" to tie low-resolution (LAMOST R
$\sim$ 1800) spectra to the label scale of a much higher-resolution (APOGEE R
$\sim$ 22,500) survey, we substantially reduce the inconsistencies between
labels measured by the individual survey pipelines. This demonstrates that
label transfer with The Cannon can successfully bring different surveys onto
the same physical scale.

to the energy-dependent waveforms produced by the rotation of hot spots on
their surfaces. These measurements will provide valuable input to theoretical
models of cold matter beyond nuclear density. Here we propose that PSR
J1614$-$2230, despite its low count rate, is a promising source to observe with
NICER. The reason is that XMM-Newton observations suggest that the fractional

cannot be very compact. We show that if we analyze 0.5 Ms of NICER data and 0.1
Ms of nearby off-source data and combine that analysis with the known mass of
this star, we would find a robust lower limit to the radius with a statistical
uncertainty of only $\sim 0.5-0.7$ km. We also show that even if there is an
unmodeled nonthermal component modulated at the pulsation frequency, good
statistical fits could rule out significant biases. The low count rate will
make reliable upper limits on the radius difficult, but the lower limit could
rule out some equations of state that are currently being discussed. This

domain walls, resulting macroscopically in pinched hysteresis loops and reduced
piezoelectric response. Here, we revisit the early studies on rhombohedral PZT
ceramics with tilted octahedra by considering a possible role of both tilts and
charged defects on domain-wall motion. We show that the observed pinched
hysteresis loops are likely associated with the presence of defect complexes
containing charged oxygen vacancies, and not tilts as suggested in some cases.
Regardless of the presence or absence of long-range ordered tilts in
rhombohedral PZT, the effect of charged defects is also prominent in weak-field
permittivity and piezoelectric properties, particularly at sub-Hz driving
conditions where the conductivity, related to the motion of oxygen vacancies,
gives rise to strong frequency dispersion.

the site has systematically lower PWV values, even after accounting for the

that GDAS data are not a suitable method for predicting of local atmospheric

surface from view; this causes a distortion of the spectral lines and a change
in the line-of-sight (LOS) velocities, known as the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM)
effect. Since the LOS velocities depend, in part, on the stellar rotation, the
RM waveform is sensitive to the star-planet alignment (which provides
information on the system's dynamical history). We present a new RM modelling
technique that directly measures the spatially-resolved stellar spectrum behind
the planet. This is done by scaling the continuum flux of the (HARPS) spectra
by the transit light curve, and then subtracting the in- from the
out-of-transit spectra to isolate the starlight behind the planet. This
technique does not assume any shape for the intrinsic local profiles. In it, we
also allow for differential stellar rotation and centre-to-limb variations in
the convective blueshift. We apply this technique to HD189733 and compare to 3D
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We reject rigid body rotation with high
confidence (> 99% probability), which allows us to determine the occulted
stellar latitudes and measure the stellar inclination. In turn, we determine
both the sky-projected (lambda ~ -0.4 +/- 0.2 degrees) and true 3D obliquity
(psi ~ 7^+12_-4 degrees). We also find good agreement with the MHD simulations,
with no significant centre-to-limb variations detectable in the local profiles.
Hence, this technique provides a new powerful tool that can probe stellar
photospheres, differential rotation, determine 3D obliquities, and remove
sky-projection biases in planet migration theories. This technique can be
implemented with existing instrumentation, but will become even more powerful
with the next generation of high-precision radial velocity spectrographs.

the linear extent of the finite volume. The expansion begins at ${\cal

nonrelativistic quantum mechanics and we find complete agreement. The $1/L^6$

in the three-particle case is that logarithmic dependence on $L$ appears at
$\mathcal O(1/L^6)$. Relativistic effects enter at this order, and the only
comparison possible with the nonrelativistic result is for the coefficient of
the logarithm, where we again find agreement. For a more thorough check of the

processing is simulated by imposing the Nose Hoover thermostat to the
electronic subsystem lasting for ~100 fs and continuing with microcanonical

Our calculations show the rotation of one layer with respect to another layer

a result of rotation, the off-diagonal elements of drag resistivity tensor have
non-zero values at any temperature. In addition, we show that the anisotropic
drag resistivity is very sensitive to the direction of momentum transfer
between two layers due to highly anisotropic inter-layer electron-electron

scheme for the considered WPCN. The proposed ETMRS scheme can be implemented in
a fully distributed manner as the relays only need local information to switch
between energy harvesting and information forwarding modes. By modeling the
charging/discharging behaviours of the finite-capacity battery at each relay as
a finite-state Markov Chain (MC), we derive an analytical expression for the
system outage probability of the proposed ETMRS scheme over mixed Nakagami-$m$
and Rayleigh fading channels. Based on the derived expression, the optimal
energy thresholds for all the relays corresponding to the minimum system outage
probability can be obtained via an exhaustive search. However, this approach
becomes computationally prohibitive when the number of relays and the
associated number of battery energy levels is large. To resolve this issue, we
propose a heuristic approach to optimize the energy threshold for each relay.
To gain some useful insights for practical relay design, we also derive the
upper bound for system outage probability corresponding to the case that all
relays are equipped with infinite-capacity batteries. Numerical results
validate our theoretical analysis. It is shown that the proposed heuristic
approach can achieve a near-optimal system performance and our ETMRS scheme
outperforms the existing single-relay selection scheme and common energy

minimization over a rather arbitrary sequence of (finite dimensional) subspaces
of a least square functional measuring the discrepancy from observed
trajectories produces uniform approximations to the kernel on compact sets. The
convergence result is obtained by combining mean-field limits, transport
methods, and a $\Gamma$-convergence argument. A crucial condition for the

majoring an $L_2$-norm discrepancy to the kernel with respect to a probability
measure, depending on the given initial probability distribution by suitable
push forwards and transport maps. We illustrate the convergence result by means

risk of catastrophic wildfires but there are ecological consequences.
Maintaining habitat for fauna of both sufficient extent and connectivity while
fragmenting areas of high fuel loads presents land managers with seemingly
contrasting objectives. Faced with this dichotomy, we propose a Mixed Integer
Programming (MIP) model that can optimally schedule fuel treatments to reduce
fuel hazards by fragmenting high fuel load regions while considering critical
ecological requirements over time and space. The model takes into account both
the frequency of fire that vegetation can tolerate and the frequency of fire
necessary for fire-dependent species. Our approach also ensures that suitable
alternate habitat is available and accessible to fauna affected by a treated
area. More importantly, to conserve fauna the model sets a minimum acceptable
target for the connectivity of habitat at any time . These factors are all
included in the formulation of a model that yields a multi-period
spatially-explicit schedule for treatment planning. Our approach is then
demonstrated in a series of computational experiments with hypothetical
landscapes, a single vegetation type and a group of faunal species with the
same habitat requirements. Our experiments show that it is possible to reduce
the risk of wildfires while ensuring sufficient connectivity of habitat over
both space and time. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the habitat
connectivity constraint is more effective than neighbourhood habitat
constraints. This is critical for the conservation of fauna and of special
concern for vulnerable or endangered species.

classical algebraic concepts for which the negative is a crucial ingredient,
such as determinants, Grassmann algebras, Lie algebras, Lie superalgebras, and
Poisson algebras, one often is challenged by the lack of negation. Following an
idea originating in work of Gaubert and the Max-Plus group and brought to
fruition by Akian, Gaubert, and Guterman, we study algebraic structures with
negation maps, called \textbf{systems}, in the context of universal algebra,
showing how these unify the more viable (super)tropical versions, as well as
hypergroup theory and fuzzy rings, thereby ""explaining"" similarities in their
theories. Special attention is paid to \textbf{meta-tangible} $\mathcal

many others, but is rich enough to facilitate computations and provide a host

  Basic results also are obtained in linear algebra, linking determinants to
linear independence.
  Formulating the structure categorically enables us to view the
tropicalization functor as a morphism, thereby further explaining the
mysterious link between classical algebraic results and their tropical analogs,
as well as with hyperfields. We utilize the tropicalization functor to propose
tropical analogs of classical algebraic notions.

from data has received considerable attention in recent years. In many
applications such as sensor networks and proteomics it is often expensive to
obtain samples from all the variables involved simultaneously. For instance,
this might involve the synchronization of a large number of sensors or the
tagging of a large number of proteins. To address this important issue, we
initiate the study of a novel graphical model selection problem, where the goal
is to optimize the total number of scalar samples obtained by allowing the
collection of samples from only subsets of the variables. We propose a general
paradigm for graphical model selection where feedback is used to guide the
sampling to high degree vertices, while obtaining only few samples from the
ones with the low degrees. We instantiate this framework with two specific
active learning algorithms, one of which makes mild assumptions but is
computationally expensive, while the other is more computationally efficient
but requires stronger (nevertheless standard) assumptions. Whereas the sample
complexity of passive algorithms is typically a function of the maximum degree
of the graph, we show that the sample complexity of our algorithms is provable
smaller and that it depends on a novel local complexity measure that is akin to
the average degree of the graph. We finally demonstrate the efficacy of our
framework via simulations.

together ideas from kernel machine learning, and Fourier methods. We expand the
unknown regression on the data in terms of the eigenfunctions of a kernel-based
operator, and we take advantage of orthogonality of the basis with respect to
the underlying data distribution, P, to speed up computations and tuning of
parameters. If the kernel is appropriately chosen, then the eigenfunctions
adapt to the intrinsic geometry and dimension of the data. We provide
theoretical guarantees for a radial kernel with varying bandwidth, and we
relate smoothness of the regression function with respect to P to sparsity in
the eigenbasis. Finally, using simulated and real-world data, we systematically
compare the performance of the spectral series approach with classical kernel
smoothing, k-nearest neighbors regression, kernel ridge regression, and
state-of-the-art manifold and local regression methods.

Healthcare observations, recorded in electronic medical records, are episodic

current illness states and predicts future medical outcomes. At the data level,
DeepCare represents care episodes as vectors in space, models patient health
state trajectories through explicit memory of historical records. Built on Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), DeepCare introduces time parameterizations to handle
irregular timed events by moderating the forgetting and consolidation of memory
cells. DeepCare also incorporates medical interventions that change the course
of illness and shape future medical risk. Moving up to the health state level,
historical and present health states are then aggregated through multiscale
temporal pooling, before passing through a neural network that estimates future
outcomes. We demonstrate the efficacy of DeepCare for disease progression
modeling, intervention recommendation, and future risk prediction. On two
important cohorts with heavy social and economic burden -- diabetes and mental
health -- the results show improved modeling and risk prediction accuracy.

related to the cluster algebras of Fomin and Zelevinsky. A seed is a
combinatorial data which can be encoded as an $n\times n$ matrix with integer
entries, or as a quiver in special cases, together with $n$ formal variables. A
mutation is a certain rule for transforming a seed into another seed; the new
variables are related to the previous variables by some rational expressions.
To each seed one attaches an $n$-dimensional torus, and by gluing the tori
along the birational maps defined by the mutation formulas, one constructs a
cluster variety. Quantization of a cluster variety assigns to each seed a
non-commutative ring which deforms the classical ring of functions on the torus
attached to the seed, as well as to each mutation an isomorphism of skew fields
of fractions of these non-commutative rings. A representation realizes the
non-commutative rings as algebras of operators on Hilbert spaces, and the
quantum mutation isomorphisms as unitary maps between the Hilbert spaces that
intertwine the operators for the rings. These unitary intertwiners are one of
the major results of the Fock-Goncharov quantization of cluster varieties, and
are given by the special function called the quantum dilogarithm. The classical
mutations satisfy certain algebraic relations, which were known to be satisfied
also by the corresponding intertwiners up to complex constants of modulus $1$.
The present paper shows by computation that these constants are all $1$. One
implication is that the mapping class group representations resulting from the
application of the Fock-Goncharov quantization to the quantum Teichm\""uller
theory are genuine, not projective.

ConfidentCare operates by recognizing clusters of similar patients, and
learning the best screening policy to adopt for each cluster. A cluster of

previous case studies have indicated that preceding gentle filament merging via
magnetic reconnection may launch following intense eruption, according with the
tether-cutting (TC) model. However, detailed process of TC reconnection between
filaments has not been exhibited yet. In this work, we report the high
resolution observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS)
of TC reconnection between two sheared filaments in NOAA active region 12146.
The TC reconnection commenced since 15:35 UT on 2014 August 29 and triggered an
eruptive GOES C4.3-class flare 8 minutes later. An associated coronal mass
ejection appeared in the field of view of SOHO/LASCO C2 about 40 minutes later.
Thanks to the high spatial resolution of IRIS data, bright plasma outflows
generated by the TC reconnection are clearly observed, which moved along the
subarcsecond fine-scale flux tube structures in the erupting filament. Based on
the imaging and spectral observations, the mean plane-of-sky and line-of-sight
velocities of the TC reconnection outflows are separately measured to be 79 and
86 km/s, which derives an average real speed of 120 km/s. In addition, it is
found that spectral features, such as peak intensities, Doppler shifts, and
line widths in the TC reconnection region evidently enhanced compared with
those in the nearby region just before the flare.

observation sampling epoch in a collaborative way by simultaneously processing
the latest locally sensed information~(\emph{innovations}) and the parameter
estimates from other agents~(\emph{consensus}) in the local neighborhood
conforming to a pre-specified inter-agent communication topology. Under rather
weak conditions on the connectivity of the inter-agent communication and a
\emph{global observability} criterion, it is shown that at every network agent,
the proposed algorithm leads to consistent parameter estimates. Furthermore,
under standard smoothness assumptions on the local observation functions, the
distributed estimator is shown to yield order-optimal convergence rates, i.e.,
as far as the order of pathwise convergence is concerned, the local parameter
estimates at each agent are as good as the optimal centralized nonlinear least
squares estimator which would require access to all the observations across all
the agents at all times. In order to benchmark the performance of the proposed
distributed $\mathcal{CIWNLS}$ estimator with that of the centralized nonlinear
least squares estimator, the asymptotic normality of the estimate sequence is
established and the asymptotic covariance of the distributed estimator is
evaluated. Finally, simulation results are presented which illustrate and

proposed on unstructured meshes for the compressible viscous flow computations.
The possibility to de sign such a third-order compact scheme is due to the
high-order gas evolution model, where a time-dependent gas distribution
function at a cell interface not only provides the fluxes across a cell
interface, but also the time evolution of the flow variables at the cell
interface as well. As a result, both cell averaged and cell interface flow
variables can be used for the initial data reconstruction at the beginning of
next time step. A weighted least-square reconstruction has been used for the
construction of a third-order initial condition. Therefore, a compact
third-order gas-kinetic scheme with the involvement of neighboring cells only
can be developed on unstructured meshes. In comparison with other conventional
high-order schemes, the current method avoids the use of Gaussian points for
the flux integration along a cell interface and the multi-stage Runge-Kutta
time stepping technique. The third-order compact scheme is numerically stable
under CFL condition above 0.5. Due to the multidimensional gas-kinetic
formulation and the coupling of inviscid and viscous terms, even with
unstructured meshes the boundary layer solution and the vortex structure can be
accurately captured in the current scheme. At the same time, the compact scheme
can capture strong shocks as well.

We aim to maximize the rate of one-way energy transfer from primary system to
the attachment, and focus on impulsive excitation of a two-degree-of-freedom
primary system with an essentially nonlinear attachment. The nonlinear
attachment is shown to be able to perform as a `nonlinear energy sink' (NES) by
taking away energy from the primary system irreversibly for some types of
impulsive excitations. Using perturbation analysis and exploiting separation of
time scales, we perform dimensionality reduction of this strongly nonlinear
system. Our analysis shows that efficient energy transfer to nonlinear
attachment in this system occurs for initial conditions close to homoclinic
orbit of the slow time-scale undamped system, a phenomenon that has been
previously observed for the case of single-degree-of-freedom primary systems.
Analytical formulae for optimal parameters for given impulsive excitation input
are derived. Generalization of this framework to systems with arbitrary number
of degrees-of-freedom of the primary system is also discussed. The performance

performance is sensitive to magnitude of the initial impulse, our results show
that NES performance is more robust than linear tuned-mass-damper to several
parametric perturbations. Hence, our work provides evidence that homoclinic
orbits of the underlying Hamiltonian system play a crucial role in efficient
nonlinear energy transfers, even in high dimensional systems, and gives new
insight into robustness of systems with essential nonlinearity.

numerically by means of solutions of the Euler equations. The wave dynamics
corresponds to quasi-equilibrium states characterized by JONSWAP spectra. The
spatio-temporal data are collected and processed providing information about
the wave height probability and typical appearance of abnormally high waves
(rogue waves). The waves are considered at different water depths ranging from
deep to relatively shallow cases ($k_p h > 0.8$, where $k_p$ is the peak
wavenumber, and $h$ is the local depth). The asymmetry between front and rear
rogue wave slopes is identified; it becomes apparent for sufficiently high
waves in rough sea states at all considered depths. The lifetimes of rogue
events may reach up to 30-60 wave periods depending on the water depth. The
maximum observed wave has height of about 3 significant wave heights. A few
randomly chosen in-situ time series from the Baltic Sea are in agreement with
the general picture of the numerical simulations.

train a ConvNet on a large dataset (source task) and then use feed-forward
units activation of the trained ConvNet as image representation for smaller
datasets (target task). Our key contribution is to demonstrate superior
performance of multiple ConvNet layer features over single ConvNet layer
features. Combining multiple ConvNet layer features will result in more complex
feature space with some features being repetitive. This requires some form of
feature selection. We use AdaBoost with single stumps to implicitly select only
distinct features that are useful towards classification from concatenated
ConvNet features. Experimental results show that using multiple ConvNet layer
activation features instead of single ConvNet layer features consistently will
produce superior performance. Improvements becomes significant as we increase
the distance between source task and the target task.

citation impact of papers have been frequently investigated. Most of the

collaboration activity (measured in terms of number of authors, number of

impact. However, it is not clear whether the increased citation impact is based
on the higher quality of papers which profit from more than one scientist
giving expert input or other (citation-specific) factors. Thus, the current
study addresses this question by using two comprehensive datasets with
publications (in the biomedical area) including quality assessments by experts
(F1000Prime member scores) and citation data for the publications. The study is
based on nearly 10,000 papers. Robust regression models are used to investigate
the relationship between number of authors, number of affiliations, and number
of countries, respectively, and citation impact - controlling for the papers'
quality (measured by F1000Prime expert ratings). The results point out that the
effect of collaboration activities on impact is largely independent of the
papers' quality. The citation advantage is apparently not quality-related;
citation specific factors (e.g. self-citations) seem to be important here.

challenge in resource-constrained wireless neural recording tasks, where data
compression is generally adopted to relax the burdens on the wireless data
link. Recently, Compressed Sensing (CS) theory has successfully demonstrated
its potential in neural recording application. The main limitation of CS,
however, is that the neural signals have no good sparse representation with
commonly used dictionaries and learning a reliable dictionary is often data
dependent and computationally demanding. In this paper, a novel CS approach for
implantable neural recording is proposed. The main contributions are: 1) The
co-sparse analysis model is adopted to enforce co-sparsity of the neural
signals, therefore overcoming the drawbacks of conventional synthesis model and
enhancing the reconstruction performance. 2) A multi-fractional-order
difference matrix is constructed as the analysis dictionary, thus avoiding the
dictionary learning procedure and reducing the need for previously acquired
data and computational resources. 3) By exploiting the statistical priors of
the analysis coefficients, a weighted analysis $\ell_1$-minimization (WALM)
algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the neural signals. Experimental results
on Leicester neural signal database reveal that the proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art CS-based methods. On the challenging high
compression ratio task, the proposed approach still achieves high
reconstruction performance and spike classification accuracy.

results: the model is multiplicatively renormalizable only if it involves

non-equilibrium due to the lack of energy equipartition. By constructing the
covariance matrix of spatial fluctuations and solving for its eigenmodes, we
obtain the collective motions of the system with various magnitudes.
Interestingly, our structurally ordered non-equilibrium system exhibits almost
identical properties as disordered glassy systems under thermal equilibrium:
the modes with large overall motions are spatially correlated and
quasilocalized while the modes with small collective motions are highly
localized, resembling the low- and high-frequency modes in glass. More
surprisingly, a peak similar to the boson peak forms in our non-equilibrium
system as the number of mobile particles increases, revealing the possible
origin of the boson peak from a dynamic aspect. We further illustrate that the
spatially-correlated large-movement modes can be produced by the cooperation of
highly-active particles above a threshold fraction, while the localized
small-movement modes can be created by adding individual inactive particles.
Our study clarifies the role of mobility in collective motions, and further
suggests a promising possibility of extending the powerful mode analysis
approach to non-equilibrium systems.

considered models do not fall in the class of Mielke-Tasaki flat-band

small and moderate dispersion may lead to a ferromagnetic ground state for
sufficiently large on-site Hubbard repulsion $U>U_c$, where $U_c$ increases
monotonically with the acquired bandwidth. However, we also observe for some
specific parameter cases, that (i) ferromagnetism appears at already very small
$U_c$, (ii) ferromagnetism does not show up at all, (iii) the critical on-site
repulsion $U_c$ is a nonmonotonic function of the bandwidth, or that (iv) a

noncontextual realism cannot reproduce the measurement statistics of a single

tested using a single qutrit without relying on the notion of quantum
entanglement in contrast to Bell inequality tests. It is challenging to refute
such models experimentally, since imperfections may introduce loopholes that
enable a realist interpretation. Here we use a superconducting qutrit with
deterministic, binary-outcome readouts to violate a noncontextuality inequality

ground based sub-mm instruments such as NIKA and A-MKID. For such instruments,
therefore, it is important to understand and characterize the response to
ensure good linearity and calibration over wide dynamic range. We propose to
use the MKID readout frequency response to determine the MKID responsivity to
an input optical source power. A signal can be measured in a KID as a change in
the phase of the readout signal with respect to the KID resonant circle.
Fundamentally, this phase change is due to a shift in the KID resonance
frequency, in turn due to a radiation induced change in the quasiparticle
number in the superconducting resonator. We show that shift in resonant
frequency can be determined from the phase shift by using KID phase versus
frequency dependence using a previously measured resonant frequency. Working in
this calculated resonant frequency, we gain near linearity and constant
calibration to a constant optical signal applied in a wide range of operating
points on the resonance and readout powers. This calibration method has three
particular advantages: first, it is fast enough to be used to calibrate large
arrays, with pixel counts in the thousand of pixels; second, it is based on
data that are already necessary to determine KID positions; third, it can be
done without applying any optical source in front of the array.

The model is nonlinear and consists of a coupled set of a partial differential

computational domain with a moving boundary, which is part of the solution.
Numerical simulations based on standard explicit time-stepping methods are too
time consuming due to the small time steps required for numerical stability. On
the other hand standard implicit schemes are too complex due to the nonlinear
equations that needs to be solved in each step. Instead, we propose to use the
Peaceman--Rachford splitting scheme combined with temporal and spatial scalings
of the model. Simulations based on this scheme have shown to be efficient,
accurate, and reliable which makes it possible to evaluate the model, e.g.\ its
dependency on biological and physical model parameters. These evaluations show
among other things that the initial axon growth is very fast, that the active
transport is the dominant reason over diffusion for the growth velocity, and
that the polymerization rate in the growth cone does not affect the final axon
length.

performed a simultaneous 12CO(1-0), 13CO(1-0), C18O(1-0) mapping toward
molecular clouds in a region encompassing 3.75 square degrees. We reveal three
molecular clouds, the 15 km/s cloud, the 27 km/s cloud, and the 50 km/s cloud,
in the surveyed region. The 50 km/s cloud is resolved with an angular
resolution of around 1' for the first time. Investigating their morphology and
velocity structures, we find that the 27 km/s cloud is likely affected by
feedback from the stellar association Mon OB3 and the 50 km/s cloud is
characterised by three large expanding molecular shells. The region is mapped
in C18O (1-0) for the first time. We discover seven C18O clumps, which are
likely to form massive stars, and 15 dust clumps based on the BGPS archival
data. Using infrared color-color diagrams, we find 56 Class I and 107 Class II
young stellar object (YSO) candidates. According to the distribution of YSO
candidates, an overdensity is found around the HII region S287 and the
intersection of two shells, indicative of triggering. The star formation
efficiency and rate of the 27~km/s cloud are discussed. Comparing the observed
values of the filament S287-main with the models of fragmentation, we suggest
that turbulence controls the large scale of fragmentation in the filament while
gravitational fragmentation plays an important role in the formation of YSOs on
the small scale. We find that star-forming gas tends to have higher excitation
temperature, higher 13CO opacity, and higher column density than
non-star-forming gas, which is consistent with the point that star formation
happens in denser gas and star-forming gas is heated by YSOs. Using the 1.1 mm
dust emission to trace dense gas, we obtain a dense gas fraction of 2.7%-10.4%
for the 27 km/s cloud.

where breakdown of Stokes-Einstein relation in the dynamics of supercooled

Run 2 data, could be a heavy composite axion that results from condensation of
a hypothetical quark in a high-colour representation of conventional QCD. The
model, motivated by a recently proposed solution to the strong CP problem, is
very economical and is essentially defined by the properties of the additional
quark - its colour charge, hypercharge and mass. The axion mass and its
coupling to two photons (via axial anomaly) can be computed in terms of these
parameters. The axion is predominantly produced via photon fusion
($\gamma\gamma \to {\cal A}$) which is followed by $ Z $ vector boson fusion
and associated production at the LHC. We find that the total diphoton cross
section of the axion can be fitted with the observed excess. Combining the
requirement on the cross-section, such that it reproduces the diphoton excess
events, with the bounds on the total width ($\Gamma_{tot} \leqslant 45$ GeV),
we obtain the effective coupling in the range $1.6\times 10^{-4}$
GeV$^{-1}\gtrsim C_{{\cal A}} \gtrsim 6.5\times 10^{-5}$ GeV$^{-1}$. Within
this window of allowed couplings the model favours a narrow width resonance and
$ y_{Q}^2 \sim \mathcal{O}(10)$. In addition, we observe that the associated
production $q\bar{q} \to {\cal A}\gamma\to \gamma\gamma\gamma$ can potentially
produce a sizeable number of three photon events at future LHC and $ e^{+}
e^{-} $ colliders. However, the rare decay $Z\to\mathcal{A}^*\gamma \to

describe the evolution of a two-types population. Motivated by results valid
for the well-known Moran (M) and Wright-Fisher (WF) processes, we define a
general class of Markov chains models which we term the Kimura class. It
comprises the majority of the models used in population genetics, and we show
that many well-known results valid for M and WF processes are still valid in
this class. In all Kimura processes, a mutant gene will either fixate or become
extinct, and we present a necessary and sufficient condition for such processes
to have the probability of fixation strictly increasing in the initial
frequency of mutants. This condition implies that there are WF processes with
decreasing fixation probability --- in contradistinction to M processes which
always have strictly increasing fixation probability. As a by-product, we show
that an increasing fixation probability defines uniquely an M or WF process
which realises it, and that any fixation probability with no state having
trivial fixation can be realised by at least some WF process. These results are
extended to a subclass of processes that are suitable for describing
time-inhomogeneous dynamics. We also discuss the traditional identification of
frequency dependent fitnesses and pay-offs, extensively used in evolutionary
game theory, the role of weak selection when the population is finite, and the

  Journal",,"10.1016/j.eswa.2016.01.046",,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Email classification and prioritization expert systems have the potential to
automatically group emails and users as communities based on their
communication patterns, which is one of the most tedious tasks. The exchange of
emails among users along with the time and content information determine the
pattern of communication. The intelligent systems extract these patterns from
an email corpus of single or all users and are limited to statistical analysis.
However, the email information revealed in those methods is either constricted
or widespread, i.e. single or all users respectively, which limits the
usability of the resultant communities. In contrast to extreme views of the
email information, we relax the aforementioned restrictions by considering a
subset of all users as multi-user information in an incremental way to extend
the personalization concept. Accordingly, we propose a multi-user personalized
email community detection method to discover the groupings of email users based
on their structural and semantic intimacy. We construct a social graph using
multi-user personalized emails. Subsequently, the social graph is uniquely
leveraged with expedient attributes, such as semantics, to identify user
communities through collaborative similarity measure. The multi-user
personalized communities, which are evaluated through different quality
measures, enable the email systems to filter spam or malicious emails and
suggest contacts while composing emails. The experimental results over two
randomly selected users from email network, as constrained information, unveil
partial interaction among 80% email users with 14% search space reduction where
we notice 25% improvement in the clustering coefficient.

control (MRAC) requires the system states to be persistently exciting (PE), a
restrictive condition to be verified online. A recent data-driven approach,
concurrent learning, uses information-rich past data concurrently with the
standard parameter update laws to guarantee parameter convergence without the
need of the PE condition. This method guarantees exponential convergence of
both the tracking and the controller parameter estimation errors to zero,
whereas, the classical MRAC merely ensures asymptotic convergence of tracking
error to zero. However, the method requires knowledge of the state derivative,
at least at the time instances when the state values are stored in memory. The
method further assumes knowledge of the control allocation matrix. This paper
addresses these limitations by using a memory-based finite-time system
identifier in conjunction with a data-driven approach, leading to convergence
of both the tracking and the controller parameter estimation errors without the
PE condition and knowledge of the system matrices and the state derivative. A
Lyapunov based stability proof is included to justify the validity of the
proposed data-driven approach. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of
the suggested method.

to the helical character, the forward inter-edge scattering enforces a $\pi$

performance of an infinite-server system. In our setup, a random environment is
modeled by drawing an arrival rate $\Lambda$ from a given distribution every
$\Delta$ time units, yielding an i.i.d. sequence of arrival rates
$\Lambda_1,\Lambda_2, \ldots$. Applying a martingale central limit theorem, we
obtain a functional central limit theorem for the scaled queue length process.
We proceed to large deviations and derive the logarithmic asymptotics of the
queue length's tail probabilities. As it turns out, in a rapidly changing
environment (i.e., $\Delta$ is small relative to $\Lambda$) the overdispersion
of the arrival process hardly affects system behavior, whereas in a slowly
changing random environment it is fundamentally different; this general finding
applies to both the central limit and the large deviations regime. We extend
our results to the setting where each arrival creates a job in multiple
infinite-server queues.

one-dimensional sinusoidal optical lattice in the basis of maximally localized
wannier states. Finite range, soft-core inter-atomic interactions become the
trait of Rydberg admixed atoms, which can be extended over many neighbouring
lattice sites. On contrary to dipolar gases, where the interactions follow an
inverse cubic law, the key feature of Rydberg-dressed interactions being the
possibility of making neighbouring couplings to the same magnitude as that of
the onsite ones. The maximally localized Wannier functions are typically
calculated via spread minimization procedure [Phys. Rev. B 56, 12847 (1997)]
and always found to be real functions apart from a trivial global phase when
considering an isolated set of Bloch bands. For an isolated single Bloch band,
the above procedure reduces to a simple quasi-momentum dependent unitary phase
transformation. Here, in stead of minimizing the spread, we employ a diagonal
phase transformation which eliminates the imaginary part of the Wannier
functions. The resulting Wannier states are found to be maximally localized and
in exact agreement with those obtained via spread minimization procedure. Using
that we calculate the Hubbard couplings from the Rydberg-admixed interactions,
including dominant density assisted tunnelling coefficients. In the end we
provide realistic lattice parameters for the state of the art experimental
Rydberg dressed Rubidium setup.

This is done in the framework of finite energy QCD sum rules (FESR). A pinched
integration kernel is introduced in the FESR in order to (a) quench potential
duality violations on the real axis in the complex squared energy $s$-plane,
and (b) effectively extend the analysis well beyond the kinematical
$\tau$-decay end-point where there is no longer data, i.e.\ in the range $s = 3
- 10 \,{\mbox{GeV}}^2$. In the vector channel this procedure is supplemented
with actual data from $e^+ e^-$-annihilation into hadrons, above the tau-decay
kinematical end-point, with results fully supporting this extension. Very good
agreement is obtained between data and two specific pinched FESR. Results from
this analysis are confronted with those from a specific model of DV. As the sum
rules are well satisfied in both cases within experimental errors, we conclude
that possible DV must be buried under the experimental uncertainties. In other
words, there seems to be no need for explicit models of DV in this case.
Pinched kernels work as well, but with far less free parameters.

jet. Highly absorbed X-ray emission from the nucleus of 3C 277.3 confirms that
the jet lies close to the plane of the sky and so has a large intrinsic
deflection. We detect group gas on the scale of the radio lobes, and see X-ray
cavities coincident with the brightest radio emission, with the lobes embraced
by X-ray enhancements that we argue are the result of shocks. The
anti-correlation between the locations of X-ray arms and H$\alpha$-emitting
filaments that are believed to have originated from a merger with one or more
gas-rich galaxies suggests that shocks advancing around the lobe are inhibited
by the dense colder material. Synchrotron X-ray emission is detected from the
upstream edge of a second bright radio knot. X-rays are also detected from the
location where an undetected counterjet enters the northern radio hotspot. We
suggest that these X-rays are synchrotron radiation from a shock in a

systems with very different physical properties and architectures. Among them,
the exoplanet CoRoT-29b was identified in the light curves the mission obtained
in summer 2011, and presented an asymmetric transit light curve, which was
tentatively explained via the effects of gravity darkening. Aims. Transits of
CoRoT-29b are measured with precision photometry, to characterize the reported
asymmetry in their transit shape. Methods. Using the OSIRIS spectrograph at the
10-m GTC telescope, we perform spectro-photometric differential observations,
which allow us to both calculate a high-accuracy photometric light curve, and a
study of the color-dependence of the transit. Results. After careful data
analysis, we find that the previously reported asymmetry is not present in
either of two transits, observed in July 2014 and July 2015 with high
photometric precisions of 300ppm over 5 minutes. Due to the relative faintness
of the star, we do not reach the precision necessary to perform transmission
spectroscopy of its atmosphere, but we see no signs of color-dependency of the
transit depth or duration. Conclusions. We conclude that the previously
reported asymmetry may have been a time-dependent phenomenon, which did not
occur in more recent epochs. Alternatively, instrumental effects in the
discovery data may need to be reconsidered.

long confocal annular Josephson tunnel junctions in the presence of an in-plane
magnetic field of arbitrary orientations. The behavior of a circular annular
Josephson tunnel junction is then seen to be simply a special case of the above
result. For junctions having a normalized perimeter less than one the threshold
curves are derived and computed even in the case with trapped Josephson
vortices. For longer junctions a numerical analysis is carried out after the
derivation of the appropriate motion equation for the Josephson phase. We found
that the system is modeled by a modified and perturbed sine-Gordon equation
with a space dependent effective Josephson penetration length inversely
proportional to the local junction width. Both the fluxon statics and dynamics
are deeply affected by the non-uniform annulus width. Static zero-field
multiple-fluxon solutions exist even in presence of a large bias current. The
tangential velocity of a traveling fluxon is not determined by the balance
between the driving and drag forces due to the dissipative losses. Furthermore,
the fluxon motion is characterized by a strong radial inward acceleration which
causes electromagnetic radiation concentrated at the ellipse equatorial points.

circumstellar envelopes of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. By presenting
and modelling a large number of SO and SO$_2$ lines in the low mass-loss rate
M-type AGB star R Dor, and modelling the available lines of those molecules in
a further four M-type AGB stars, we aim to determine their circumstellar
abundances and distributions. We use a detailed radiative transfer analysis
based on the accelerated lambda iteration method to model circumstellar SO and
SO$_2$ line emission and molecular data files for both SO and SO$_2$ that are
more extensive than those previously available. Using 17 SO lines and 98 SO2
lines to constrain our models for R Dor, we find an SO abundance of
6.7x10$^{-6}$ and an SO$_2$ abundance of 5x10$^{-6}$ with both species having
high abundances close to the star. We also modelled $^{34}$SO and found an
abundance of 3.1x10$^{-7}$, giving an $^{32}$SO/$^{34}$SO ratio of 21.6. We
derive similar results for the circumstellar SO and SO$_2$ abundances and their
distributions for the low mass-loss rate object W Hya. For these stars, the
circumstellar SO and SO$_2$ abundances are much higher than predicted by
chemical models and these two species may account for all available sulphur.
For the higher mass-loss rate stars, we find shell-like SO distributions with
peak abundances that decrease and peak abundance radii that increase with
increasing mass-loss rate. The positions of the peak SO abundance agree very
well with the photodissociation radii of H$_2$O. We find evidence that SO is
most likely through the photodissociation of H$_2$O and the subsequent reaction
between S and OH. The S-bearing parent molecule appears not to be H$_2$S. The
SO$_2$ models suggest an origin close to the star for this species, also
disagreeing with current chemical models.

problems with large noise that is in general unbounded in the image space of
the forward operator. We introduce a Banach space setting that allows to define
a reasonable notion of solutions for more general noise in a larger space

  A key observation, which guides us through the subsequent analysis, is that
such a general noise model can be understood with the same setting as
approximate source conditions (while a standard model of bounded noise is
related directly to classical source conditions). Based on this insight we
obtain a quite general existence result for regularized variational problems
and derive error estimates in terms of Bregman distances. The latter are
specialized for the particularly important cases of one- and p-homogeneous
regularization functionals.
  As a natural further step we study stochastic noise models and in particular
white noise, for which we derive error estimates in terms of the expectation of
the Bregman distance. The finiteness of certain expectations leads to a novel
class of abstract smoothness conditions on the forward operator, which can be
easily interpreted in the Hilbert space case. We finally exemplify the approach
and in particular the conditions for popular examples of regularization
functionals given by squared norm, Besov norm and total variation,
respectively.

in this plane of the two-component dwarf galaxies was compared with the

Bright unbarred disc galaxies show a strong correlation in the $r_{b,e}/h$-$n$
plane. Galaxies with larger S\`ersic shape parameters show a higher $r_{b,e}/h$
ratio. In contrast, two-component early-type dwarf galaxies do not follow the
same correlation. A fraction ($\sim$55%) of them are located outside the locus
defined in this plane by having 95$\%$ of bright disc galaxies. This
distribution indicates that they are not a low-mass replica of bright disc
galaxies. The different location in the $r_{b,e}/h$- $n$ plane of two-component
early-type dwarfs and bright galaxies can be qualitatively explain whether the

geometry-induced potential (GIP) acts upon the dynamics. In this work we study
the problem of prescribed GIP for curves and surfaces in Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^3$, i.e., how to find a curved region with a potential given {\it a

equations, while the problem for surfaces involves a non-linear 2nd order
partial differential equation (PDE). Here, we explore the GIP for surfaces
invariant by a 1-parameter group of isometries of $\mathbb{R}^3$, which turns
the PDE into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and leads to cylindrical,
revolution, and helicoidal surfaces. Helicoidal surfaces are particularly
important, since they are natural candidates to establish a link between
chirality and the GIP. Finally, for the family of helicoidal minimal surfaces,
we prove the existence of geometry-induced bound and localized states and the
possibility of controlling the change in the distribution of the probability
density when the surface is subjected to an extra charge.

clouds, through aliphatic-rich carbonaceous mantle formation and grain-grain
coagulation. Methods. We model the effects of wide band gap a-C:H mantle
formation and the low-level aggregation of diffuse interstellar medium dust in
the moderately-extinguished outer regions of molecular clouds. Results. The
formation of wide band gap a-C:H mantles on amorphous silicate and amorphous
carbon (a-C) grains leads to a decrease in their absorption cross-sections but
no change in their scattering cross-sections at near-IR wavelengths, resulting
in higher albedos. Conclusions. The evolution of dust, with increasing density

commonly referred to as ""Cloudshine"", and in the mid-IR, the so-called
""Coreshine"". These C-shine observations have usually been explained with grain
growth but no model has yet been able to self-consistently explain the dust
spectral energy distribution from the near-IR to the submm. We want to
demonstrate the ability of our new core/mantle evolutionary dust model THEMIS
(The Heterogeneous dust Evolution Model at the IaS), which has been shown to be
valid in the far-IR and submm, to reproduce the C-shine observations. Our
starting point is a physically motivated core/mantle dust model. It consists of
3 dust populations: small aromatic-rich carbon grains; bigger core/mantle
grains with mantles of aromatic-rich carbon and cores either made of amorphous
aliphatic-rich carbon or amorphous silicate. We assume an evolutionary path
where these grains, when entering denser regions, may first form a second
aliphatic-rich carbon mantle (coagulation of small grains, accretion of carbon
from the gas phase), second coagulate together to form large aggregates, and
third accrete gas phase molecules coating them with an ice mantle. To compute
the corresponding dust emission and scattering, we use a 3D Monte-Carlo
radiative transfer code. We show that our global evolutionary dust modelling
approach THEMIS allows us to reproduce C-shine observations towards dense
starless clouds. Dust scattering and emission is most sensitive to the cloud
central density and to the steepness of the cloud density profile. Varying
these two parameters leads to changes, which are stronger in the near-IR, in
both the C-shine intensity and profile. With a combination of aliphatic-rich
mantle formation and low-level coagulation into aggregates, we can
self-consistently explain the observed C-shine and far-IR/submm emission
towards dense starless clouds.

noise vector is i.i.d. Gaussian with known variance. For a squared-error loss
function, the James-Stein (JS) estimator is known to dominate the simple
maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator when the dimension $n$ exceeds two. The
JS-estimator shrinks the observed vector towards the origin, and the risk
reduction over the ML-estimator is greatest for $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ that lie
close to the origin. JS-estimators can be generalized to shrink the data
towards any target subspace. Such estimators also dominate the ML-estimator,
but the risk reduction is significant only when $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ lies
close to the subspace. This leads to the question: in the absence of prior
information about $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, how do we design estimators that give
significant risk reduction over the ML-estimator for a wide range of
$\boldsymbol{\theta}$?
  In this paper, we propose shrinkage estimators that attempt to infer the
structure of $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ from the observed data in order to construct
a good attracting subspace. In particular, the components of the observed
vector are separated into clusters, and the elements in each cluster shrunk
towards a common attractor. The number of clusters and the attractor for each
cluster are determined from the observed vector. We provide concentration
results for the squared-error loss and convergence results for the risk of the
proposed estimators. The results show that the estimators give significant risk
reduction over the ML-estimator for a wide range of $\boldsymbol{\theta}$,
particularly for large $n$. Simulation results are provided to support the
theoretical claims.

a classical theorem stating that a formal power series with coefficients in a
finite field is algebraic if and only if the sequence of its coefficients can
be generated by an automaton. We revisit and enhance two constructive proofs of
this result for finite prime fields. The first proof uses Mahler equations,
whose sizes appear to be prohibitively large. The second proof relies on
diagonals of rational functions; we turn it into an efficient algorithm, of
complexity linear in $\log N$ and quasi-linear in $p$.

layers and spot-like chemical structures may develope in their atmospheres.
Recent observations show that abundance peculiarities can change as stars
evolve on the main sequence and the timescale of these changes lies in a wide
range from million years to months. These observations imply that, perhaps, our
understanding of diffusion processes at work in magnetic stars is incomplete
and a more detailed analysis of these processes is required. In the present
paper, we consider diffusion caused by a combined influence of the electric
current and the Hall effect.Such diffusion has a number of very particular
properties and, generally, can change the surface chemistry of stars in
combination with other diffusion processes. For instance, current-driven
diffusion is accompanied by a propagation of the special type of waves in which
only the impurity number density oscillates. Propagation of such waves changes
the shape and size of spots as well as chemical abundances within them. The
period of compositional waves depends on the parameters of plasma (magnetic
field, electric current, temperature, etc.) and can be different for the waves
of different elements. Compositional waves exist in the regions where the
magnetic pressure is greater than the gas pressure. These waves can be the
reason of variations with different timescales in the abundance peculiarities
of magnetic stars.

polymers pulled by a constant force at one end. For low torques the polymer
rotates maintaining its equilibrium conformation. At intermediate torques the
polymer assumes a trumpet shape, being composed by blobs of increasing size. At
even larger torques the polymer is partially wrapped around the rod. We derive
several scaling relations between various quantities as angular velocity,
elongation and torque. The analytical predictions match the simulation data

non-uniform configurations of such active apolar fluids display laminar (i.e.,
time-independent) flow even for arbitrarily small activity. We also show that
two-dimensional active nematics confined on a surface of non-vanishing Gaussian

geodesics must converge or diverge on surfaces with non-zero Gaussian

extend our analysis to bulk systems and show how to induce thresholdless active

both. The resulting laminar flow fields are determined analytically in three

on many parameters that are difficult to disentangle. We study the effect of
plasticity on the crumpling process, and disentangle the effects of plasticity
and dimensionality of compaction by performing isotropic compaction experiments
on various materials with different elastoplasticities. The force required to
crumple a sheet into a ball as well as the number of layers inside the ball
have a power-law dependence on the size of the crumpled ball, each with its own
power-law exponent. We experimentally determine both exponents and find that
they are linearly proportional to and decrease with increasing plasticity of
the material. Finally we provide a scaling argument predicting a linear
relation between the two exponents with a coefficient of 3.5 in excellent
agreement with our experimental results.

dependencies (fds) in the Data Exchange (DE) process. Target fds naturally
occur in many DE scenarios, including the ones in Life Sciences in which
multiple source relations need to be structured under a constrained target
schema. However, despite their wide use, target fds' evaluation is still a
bottleneck in the state-of-the-art DE engines. Systems relying on an all-SQL
approach typically do not support target fds unless additional information is
provided. Alternatively, DE engines that do include these dependencies
typically pay the price of a significant drop in performance and scalability.
In this paper, we present a novel chase-based algorithm that can efficiently
handle arbitrary fds on the target. Our approach essentially relies on
exploiting the interactions between source-to-target (s-t) tuple-generating
dependencies (tgds) and target fds. This allows us to tame the size of the
intermediate chase results, by playing on a careful ordering of chase steps
interleaving fds and (chosen) tgds. As a direct consequence, we importantly
diminish the fd application scope, often a central cause of the dramatic
overhead induced by target fds. Moreover, reasoning on dependency interaction
further leads us to interesting parallelization opportunities, yielding
additional scalability gains. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of
our chase-based algorithm and an experimental study aiming at gauging its
scalability with respect to a number of parameters, among which the size of
source instances and the number of dependencies of each tested scenario.
Finally, we empirically compare with the latest DE engines, and show that our
algorithm outperforms them.

large Round Trip Times (RTT) result in large spikes in queuing delays, which

MADPIE is a simple extension to PIE that adds deterministic packet drops at
controlled intervals. By means of simulations, we observe that our proposed

momentum space in the rest frame of a fluid element. However, in situations
where the single-particle distribution function is highly anisotropic in

relativistic energies, such an expansion is bound to break down. Nevertheless,
one can still derive a fluid-dynamical theory, called anisotropic dissipative

at the ILC where the toponia are produced near the threshold. With the
approximation that the production vertex of the Higgs boson and toponia is
contact, and neglecting the P-wave toponia, we analytically calculated the
density matrix for the production and decay of the toponia. Under these
assumptions, the production spectrum of the toponia is solely determined by the
spin quantum number, therefore the toponia can be either singlet or triplet. We
find that the production rate of the singlet toponium is highly suppressed, and
behaves just like the production of a P-wave toponia. In the case of the
triplet toponium, three completely independent CP observables, namely azimuthal
angles of lepton and anti-lepton in the toponium rest-frame as well as their
sum, are predicted based on our analytical results, and checked by using the
tree-level event generator. The non-trivial correlations come from the
longitudinal-transverse interferences for the azimuthal angles of leptons, and
the transverse-transverse interference for their sum. These three observables
are well defined at the ILC, where the rest frame of the toponium can be
reconstructed directly. Furthermore, the QCD-strong corrections, which are
important near the threshold region, are also studied with the approximation of
spin-independent QCD-Coulomb potential. While the total cross section is
enhanced, the spin correlations predicted in this paper are not affected.

numerical simulations, the role of collisional coupling between a
proton-electron charge-neutral fluid and a neutral hydrogen fluid for the 1D
Riemann problem initiated in a constant pressure and density background state
by a discontinuity in the magnetic field. This system, in the MHD limit, is
characterised by two waves: a fast-mode rarefaction wave that drives a flow
towards a slow-mode MHD shock. The system evolves through four stage:
initiation, weak coupling, intermediate coupling and a quasi steady state. The
initial stages are characterised by an over-pressured neutral region that
expands with characteristics of a blast wave. In the later stages, the system
tends towards a self-similar solution where the main drift velocity is
concentrated in the thin region of the shock front. Due to the nature of the
system, the neutral fluid is overpressured by the shock when compared to a
purely hydrodynamic shock which results in the neutral fluid expanding to form
the shock precursor. The thickness of the shockfront once it has formed
proportional to the ionisation fraction to the power -1.2, which is a smaller
exponent than would be naively expected from simple scaling arguments. One
interesting result is that the shock front is a continuous transition of the
physical variables for sub-sonic velocity upstream of the shock front (a
c-shock) to a sharp jump in the physical variables followed by a relaxation to
the downstream values for supersonic upstream velocity (a j-shock). The
frictional heating that results from the velocity drift across the shock front
can amount to approximately two per cent of the reference magnetic energy.

processes, which are able to reproduce the burstiness of lightning strikes, an
essential feature of stochastic time dependence of incidence of lightning
strikes. The standard Poisson processes used in the past efforts in this area
cannot do that.

with extremely large datasets of well-sampled light curves (LCs) of transient
objects. This motivates systematic studies of the light curves of supernovae
(SNe) of all types, including the early rising phase. We performed unsupervised
k-means clustering on a sample of 59 R-band Type II SN light curves and find
that our sample can be divided into three classes: slowly-rising (II-S),
fast-rise/slow-decline (II-FS), and fast-rise/fast-decline (II-FF). We also
identify three outliers based on the algorithm. We find that performing
clustering on the first two components of a principal component analysis gives
equivalent results to the analysis using the full LC morphologies. This may
indicate that Type II LCs could possibly be reduced to two parameters. We
present several important caveats to the technique, and find that the division
into these classes is not fully robust and is sensitive to the uncertainty on
the time of first light. Moreover these classes have some overlap, and are
defined in the R-band only. It is currently unclear if they represent distinct
physical classes, and more data is needed to study these issues. However, our
analysis shows that the outliers are actually composed of slowly-evolving SN
IIb, demonstrating the potential use of such methods. The slowly-evolving SNe
IIb may arise from single massive progenitors.

non-empty subset of $\mathbb{N}_0$. Denote the power set of $X$ by
$\mathcal{P}(X)$. An integer additive set-labeling (IASL) of a graph $G$ is an
injective set-valued function $f:V(G)\to \mathcal{P}(X)$ such that the induced
function $f^+:E(G) \to \mathcal{P}(X)$ is defined by $f^+ (uv) = f(u)+ f(v)$,
where $f(u)+f(v)$ is the sumset of $f(u)$ and $f(v)$. If the associated
set-valued edge function $f^+$ is also injective, then such an IASL is called
an integer additive set-indexer (IASI). An IASL $f$ is said to be a topological
IASL (TIASL) if $f(V(G))\cup \{\emptyset\}$ is a topology of the ground set
$X$. An IASL is said to be an integer additive set-sequential labeling (IASSL)
if $f(V(G))\cup f^+(E(G))= \mathcal{P}(X)-\{\emptyset\}$. An IASL of a given
graph $G$ is said to be a topological integer additive set-sequential labeling
of $G$, if it is a topological integer additive set-labeling as well as an
integer additive set-sequential labeling of $G$. In this paper, we study the
conditions required for a graph $G$ to admit this type of IASL and propose some
important characteristics of the graphs which admit this type of IASLs.

having low dimensional data to be justified by a linear model defined in a high
dimensional parameter space. The difference in dimensionality makes the problem
ill-defined: the model is consistent with the data for many values of its
parameters. The objective is to find the probability distribution of parameter
values consistent with the data, a problem that can be cast as the exploration
of a high dimensional convex polytope. In this work we introduce a novel
algorithm to solve this problem efficiently. It provides results that are
statistically indistinguishable from currently used numerical techniques while
its running time scales linearly with the system size. We show that the
algorithm performs robustly in many abstract and practical applications. As
working examples we simulate the effects of restricting reaction fluxes on the
space of feasible phenotypes of a {\em genome} scale E. Coli metabolic network
and infer the traffic flow between origin and destination nodes in a real
communication network.

crumpled into a fractal surface and supplied with a fractal network of pipes.
We derive the efficiencies of such exchangers, showing the potential for
significant gains compared to regular exchangers (where the active layer is
flat), using parameters relevant for biological systems.
