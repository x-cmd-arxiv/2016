  Study on Shapley Centrality and Single-Node-Influence Centrality","The 10-page extended abstract version appears in WWW'2017",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study network centrality based on dynamic influence propagation models in
social networks. To illustrate our integrated mathematical-algorithmic approach
for understanding the fundamental interplay between dynamic influence processes
and static network structures, we focus on two basic centrality measures: (a)
Single Node Influence (SNI) centrality, which measures each node's significance
by its influence spread; and (b) Shapley Centrality, which uses the Shapley
value of the influence spread function --- formulated based on a fundamental
cooperative-game-theoretical concept --- to measure the significance of nodes.
We present a comprehensive comparative study of these two centrality measures.
Mathematically, we present axiomatic characterizations, which precisely capture
the essence of these two centrality measures and their fundamental differences.
Algorithmically, we provide scalable algorithms for approximating them for a
large family of social-influence instances. Empirically, we demonstrate their
similarity and differences in a number of real-world social networks, as well
as the efficiency of our scalable algorithms. Our results shed light on their
applicability: SNI centrality is suitable for assessing individual influence in
isolation while Shapley centrality assesses individuals' performance in group
influence settings.

Dark Matter. Dark Matter in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles
(WIMPs) can be detected directly, via its elastic scattering off target nuclei.
Most current direct detection experiments only measure the energy of the
recoiling nuclei. However, directional detection experiments are sensitive to
the direction of the nuclear recoil as well. Due to the Sun's motion with
respect to the Galactic rest frame, the directional recoil rate has a dipole
feature, peaking around the direction of the Solar motion. This provides a
powerful tool for demonstrating the Galactic origin of nuclear recoils and
hence unambiguously detecting Dark Matter. Furthermore, the directional recoil
distribution depends on the WIMP mass, scattering cross section and local
velocity distribution. Therefore, with a large number of recoil events it will
be possible to study the physics of Dark Matter in terms of particle and
astrophysical properties. We review the potential of directional detectors for
detecting and characterizing WIMPs.

surfaces are studied numerically and theoretically. We find that for high
impact velocities and negligible surface friction at the solid surface (i.e.
free-slip), about one half of the initial kinetic energy is transformed into
surface energy, independent of the impact parameters and the detailed energy
loss mechanism(s). We argue that this seemingly universal rule is related to
the deformation mode of the droplet and is reminiscent of pipe flow undergoing
a sudden expansion, for which the head loss can be calculated by multiplying
the kinetic energy of the incoming flow by a geometrical factor. For impacts on
a no-slip surface also dissipation in the shear boundary layer at the solid
surface is important. In this case the geometric head loss acts as a lower
bound on the total dissipation (i.e. the spreading on a no-slip surface
approaches that on a free-slip surface when the droplet viscosity is send to
zero).
  This new view on the impact problem allows for simple analytical estimates of
the maximum spreading diameter of impacting drops as a function of the impact
parameters and the properties of the solid surface. It bridges the gap between
previous momentum balance approaches and energy balance approaches, which
hitherto did not give consistent predictions in the low viscosity limit. Good
agreement is found between our models and experiments, both for impacts on
""slippery"" or lubricated surfaces (e.g. Leidenfrost droplet impacts and head-on
droplet-droplet collisions) and for impacts on no-slip surfaces.

particle systems driven over random or periodic substrates. This type of system
is relevant to vortices in type-II superconductors, sliding charge density
waves, electron crystals, colloids, stripe and pattern forming systems, and
skyrmions, and could also have connections to jamming, glassy behaviors, and
active matter. These systems are ideal for exploring the broader issues of
characterizing transient and steady state nonequilibrium flow phases as well as
nonequilibrium phase transitions between distinct dynamical phases, analogous
to phase transitions between different equilibrium states. We discuss elastic
and plastic depinning on random substrates and the different types of
nonequilibrium phases that produce features in the velocity-force curves,
fluctuation spectra, scaling relations, and local or global particle ordering.
We describe how these quantities change depending on dimension, anisotropy,
disorder strength, and the presence of hysteresis. Within the moving phase we
discuss transitions from a liquid-like state to dynamically ordered moving
crystal, smectic, or nematic states. Systems with periodic or quasiperiodic
substrates can have multiple nonequilibrium transitions in the moving state
between chaotic and coherent phases, and can exhibit hysteresis. We also
discuss systems with competing repulsive and attractive interactions, which
undergo dynamical transitions into stripes and other complex morphologies when
driven over random substrates. Throughout this work we highlight open issues
and future directions such as absorbing phase transitions, nonequilibrium work
relations, inertia, the role of non-dissipative dynamics such as Magnus
effects, and how these results could be extended to the broader issues of
plasticity in crystals, amorphous solids, and jamming phenomena.

be composed of many small-scale knots or clumps. In this paper we report
results of 3-D numerical simulations designed to study how such clumps interact
and create morphologies and kinematic patterns seen in emission line
observations. Our simulations focus on clump scale dynamics by imposing
velocity differences between spherical, over-dense regions which then lead to
the formation of bow shocks as faster clumps overtake slower material. We show
that much of the spatial structure apparent in emission line images of jets
arises from the dynamics and interactions of these bow shocks. Our simulations
show a variety of time-dependent features, including bright knots associated
with Mach stems where the shocks intersect, a ""frothy"" emission structure that
arises from the presence of the Non-linear Thin Shell Instability (NTSI) along
the surfaces of the bow shocks, and the merging and fragmentation of clumps.
Our simulations use a new non-equilibrium cooling method to produce synthetic
emission maps in H$\alpha$ and [S II]. These are directly compared with
multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of Herbig-Haro (HH) jets.
We find excellent agreement between features seen in the simulations and the
observations in terms of both proper motion and morphologies. Thus we conclude
that YSO jets may be dominated by heterogeneous structures and that
interactions between these structures and the shocks they produce can account
for many details of YSO jet evolution.

reweights the microscopic transitions of the system to improve consistency with
a set of coarse kinetic observables. The method employs the well-developed
Markov state modeling framework to efficiently link microscopic dynamics with
long-time scale constraints, thereby consistently addressing a wide range of
time scales. To emphasize the robustness of the method, we consider two
distinct coarse-grained models with significant kinetic inconsistencies. When
applied to the simulated conformational dynamics of small peptides, the
reweighting procedure systematically improves the time scale separation of the
slowest processes. Additionally, constraining the forward and backward rates
between metastable states leads to slight improvement of their relative
stabilities and, thus, refined equilibrium properties of the resulting model.

the $N$-body lowest eigenenergy and eigenstate. To bring out the effect of
quantum (Bose) statistics and consequent phase stiffness (rigidity) of the
variationally obtained many-body wavefunction on various physical quantities,
our study spans from few-body ($N=2$) to many-body ($N=16$) systems. Further,
to examine the finite-range effect of the repulsive Gaussian potential on
many-body ground state properties of the Bose-condensate, we obtain the lowest
eigenstate, the critical angular velocity of single vortex state and the
quantum correlation (measured) in terms of von Neumann entanglement entropy and
degree of condensation. It is found that for small values of the range
(measured by the parameter $\sigma$) of Gaussian potential, the ground state
energy increases for few-boson ($2\le N\le 8$) systems but decreases for
many-boson ($N>8$) systems. On the other hand for relatively large values of
the range of Gaussian potential, the ground state energy exhibits a monotonic
decrease, regardless of the number of bosons $N$. For a given $N$, there is
found an optimal value of the range of Gaussian potential for which the first
vortex (with $L_{z}=N$) nucleates at a lower value of the rotational angular

particular, we examine the role of diffusion in the production of enriched
outflows, and in determining the metallicity distributions of gas and stars. We
investigate different diffusion strengths, by changing the pre-factor of the
diffusion coefficient, by varying how the diffusion coefficient is calculated
from the local velocity distribution, and by varying whether the speed of sound
is included as a velocity term. Stronger diffusion produces a tighter
[O/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution in the gas, and cuts off the gas metallicity
distribution function at lower metallicities. Diffusion suppresses the
formation of low-metallicity stars, even with weak diffusion, and also strips
metals from enriched outflows. This produces a remarkably tight correlation
between ""metal mass-loading"" (mean metal outflow rate divided by mean metal
production rate) and the strength of diffusion, even when the diffusion
coefficient is calculated in different ways. The effectiveness of outflows at
removing metals from dwarf galaxies and the metal distribution of the gas is
thus dependent on the strength of diffusion. By contrast, we show that the
metallicities of stars are not strongly dependent on the strength of diffusion,
provided that some diffusion is present.

spontaneous symmetry breaking characterized by the reduction of a structure
group G of P->X to its closed subgroup H. This reduction is ensured by the
existence of global sections of the quotient bundle P/H->X treated as classical
Higgs fields. Matter fields with an exact symmetry group H in such gauge theory
are considered in the pairs with Higgs fields, and they are represented by
sections of a composite bundle Y->P/H->X, where Y->P/H is a fiber bundle
associated to a principal bundle P->P/H with a structure group H. A key point
is that a composite bundle Y->X is proved to be associated to a principal
G-bundle P->X. Therefore, though matter fields possess an exact symmetry group
H, their gauge G-invariant theory in the presence of Higgs fields can be
developed. Its gauge invariant Lagrangian factorizes through the vertical
covariant differential determined by a connection on a principal H-bundle
P->P/H. In a case of the Cartan decomposition of a Lie algebra of G, this

frameworks that automatically infer queries from a set of examples have been
proposed. While highly useful, a shortcoming of the approach is that if users
can only provide a small set of examples, many inherently different queries may
qualify, and only some of these actually match the user intentions. Our main
observation is that if users further explain their examples, the set of
qualifying queries may be significantly more focused. We develop a novel
framework where users explain example tuples by choosing input tuples that are
intuitively the ""cause"" for their examples. Their explanations are
automatically ""compiled"" into a formal model for explanations, based on
previously developed models of data provenance. Then, our novel algorithms
infer conjunctive queries from the examples and their explanations. We prove
the computational efficiency of the algorithms and favorable properties of
inferred queries. We have further implemented our solution in a system
prototype with an interface that assists users in formulating explanations in
an intuitive way. Our experimental results, including a user study as well as
experiments using the TPC-H benchmark, indicate the effectiveness of our

controlling the growth to obtain high quality single crystal films having the
right oxygen stoichiometry, especially in a high vacuum environment, has been

plume kinetic energy, stoichiometric crystalline films can be synthesized
without generating oxygen defects, even in high vacuum. We use a model
homoepitaxial system of SrTiO3 (STO) thin films on single crystal STO
substrates. Physical property measurements indicate that oxygen vacancy
generation in high vacuum is strongly influenced by the energetics of the laser
plume, and it can be controlled by proper laser beam delivery. Therefore, our
finding not only provides essential insight into oxygen stoichiometry control
in high vacuum for understanding the fundamental properties of STO-based thin

other materials as well.

2005. Research on vulnerability and on adaptation published the largest
proportion of very important papers. Research on climate change is
quantitatively dominated by the USA, followed by the UK, Germany, and Canada.
The citation-based indicators exhibit consistently that the UK has produced the
largest proportion of high impact papers compared to the other countries
(having published more than 10,000 papers). The title word analysis shows that
the term climate change comes forward with time. Furthermore, the term impact
arises and points to research dealing with the various effects of climate
change. Finally, the term model and related terms prominently appear
independent of time, indicating the high relevance of climate modeling.

the necessity to manually select orbitals for the active space. This selection
requires both expertise and experience and can therefore impose severe
limitations on the applicability of this most general class of ab initio
methods. A poor choice of the active orbital space may yield even qualitatively
wrong results. This is obviously a severe problem, especially for wave function
methods that are designed to be systematically improvable. Here, we show how
the iterative nature of the density matrix renormalization group combined with
its capability to include up to about one hundred orbitals in the active space
can be exploited for a systematic assessment and selection of active orbitals.
These benefits allow us to implement an automated approach for active orbital
space selection, which can turn multi-configuration models into black box
approaches.

Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a
transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency
from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of $1.0 \times
10^{-21}$. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the
inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting
single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter
signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1
event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1
{\sigma}. The source lies at a luminosity distance of $410^{+160}_{-180}$ Mpc
corresponding to a redshift $z = 0.09^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$. In the source frame,
the initial black hole masses are $36^{+5}_{-4} M_\odot$ and $29^{+4}_{-4}
M_\odot$, and the final black hole mass is $62^{+4}_{-4} M_\odot$, with
$3.0^{+0.5}_{-0.5} M_\odot c^2$ radiated in gravitational waves. All
uncertainties define 90% credible intervals.These observations demonstrate the
existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct
detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black
hole merger.

observable volume and measurement time exceeded that of all previous runs
within the first 16 days of coincident observation. On September 14th, 2015 the
Advanced LIGO detectors observed a transient gravitational-wave signal
determined to be the coalescence of two black holes [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116,

GW150914, was observed with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 24 in

Lett. 116, 241102 (2016)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.241102","LIGO-P1500218","gr-qc astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  On September 14, 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave
Observatory (LIGO) detected a gravitational-wave transient (GW150914); we
characterize the properties of the source and its parameters. The data around
the time of the event were analyzed coherently across the LIGO network using a
suite of accurate waveform models that describe gravitational waves from a
compact binary system in general relativity. GW150914 was produced by a nearly
equal mass binary black hole of $36^{+5}_{-4} M_\odot$ and $29^{+4}_{-4}
M_\odot$; for each parameter we report the median value and the range of the
90% credible interval. The dimensionless spin magnitude of the more massive
black hole is bound to be $<0.7$ (at 90% probability). The luminosity distance
to the source is $410^{+160}_{-180}$ Mpc, corresponding to a redshift
$0.09^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ assuming standard cosmology. The source location is
constrained to an annulus section of $610$ deg$^2$, primarily in the southern
hemisphere. The binary merges into a black hole of $62^{+4}_{-4} M_\odot$ and
spin $0.67^{+0.05}_{-0.07}$. This black hole is significantly more massive than
any other inferred from electromagnetic observations in the stellar-mass
regime.

Lett. 116, 221101 (2016)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.221101","LIGO-P1500213","gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The LIGO detection of GW150914 provides an unprecedented opportunity to study
the two-body motion of a compact-object binary in the large velocity, highly
nonlinear regime, and to witness the final merger of the binary and the
excitation of uniquely relativistic modes of the gravitational field. We carry
out several investigations to determine whether GW150914 is consistent with a
binary black-hole merger in general relativity. We find that the final
remnant's mass and spin, as determined from the low-frequency (inspiral) and
high-frequency (post-inspiral) phases of the signal, are mutually consistent
with the binary black-hole solution in general relativity. Furthermore, the
data following the peak of GW150914 are consistent with the least-damped
quasi-normal mode inferred from the mass and spin of the remnant black hole. By
using waveform models that allow for parameterized general-relativity
violations during the inspiral and merger phases, we perform quantitative tests
on the gravitational-wave phase in the dynamical regime and we determine the
first empirical bounds on several high-order post-Newtonian coefficients. We
constrain the graviton Compton wavelength, assuming that gravitons are
dispersed in vacuum in the same way as particles with mass, obtaining a
$90\%$-confidence lower bound of $10^{13}$ km. In conclusion, within our
statistical uncertainties, we find no evidence for violations of general
relativity in the genuinely strong-field regime of gravity.

Advanced LIGO detectors on September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC. To assess the
implications of this discovery, the detectors remained in operation with
unchanged configurations over a period of 39 d around the time of the signal.
At the detection statistic threshold corresponding to that observed for
GW150914, our search of the 16 days of simultaneous two-detector observational
data is estimated to have a false alarm rate (FAR) of $< 4.9 \times 10^{-6} \,
\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, yielding a $p$-value for GW150914 of $< 2 \times 10^{-7}$.
Parameter estimation followup on this trigger identifies its source as a binary
black hole (BBH) merger with component masses $(m_1, m_2) =
\left(36^{+5}_{-4},29^{+4}_{-4}\right) \, M_\odot$ at redshift $z =
0.09^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ (median and 90\% credible range). Here we report on the
constraints these observations place on the rate of BBH coalescences.
Considering only GW150914, assuming that all BBHs in the Universe have the same
masses and spins as this event, imposing a search FAR threshold of 1 per 100
years, and assuming that the BBH merger rate is constant in the comoving frame,
we infer a 90% credible range of merger rates between $2$--$53 \,
\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ (comoving frame). Incorporating all search
triggers that pass a much lower threshold while accounting for the uncertainty
in the astrophysical origin of each trigger, we estimate a higher rate, ranging
from $13$--$600 \, \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ depending on assumptions
about the BBH mass distribution. All together, our various rate estimates fall
in the conservative range $2$--$600 \, \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$.

by searches for short-duration gravitational-wave transients. These searches
identify time-correlated transients in multiple detectors with minimal
assumptions aboutthe signal morphology, allowing them to be sensitive to
gravitational waves emitted by a wide range of sources including binary
black-hole mergers. Over the observational period from September 12th to
October 20th 2015, these transient searches were sensitive to binary black-hole
mergers similar to GW150914 to an average distance of $\sim 600$ Mpc. In this
paper, we describe the analyses that first detected GW150914 as well as the
parameter estimation and waveform reconstruction techniques that initially
identified GW150914 as the merger of two black holes. We find that the
reconstructed waveform is consistent with the signal from a binary black-hole
merger with a chirp mass of $\sim 30 \, M_\odot$ and a total mass before merger
of $\sim 70 \, M_\odot$ in the detector frame.

applying time domain filters, which are designed from a frequency domain model
of the detector's gravitational-wave response. The gravitational-wave response
model is determined by the detector's opto-mechanical response and the
properties of its feedback control system. The measurements used to validate
the model and characterize its uncertainty are derived primarily from a
dedicated photon radiation pressure actuator, with cross-checks provided by
optical and radio frequency references. We describe how the gravitational-wave
readout signal is calibrated into equivalent gravitational-wave-induced strain
and how the statistical uncertainties and systematic errors are assessed.
Detector data collected over 38 calendar days, from September 12 to October 20,

LIGO detectors provides the first observational evidence for the existence of
binary black-hole systems that inspiral and merge within the age of the
Universe. Such black-hole mergers have been predicted in two main types of
formation models, involving isolated binaries in galactic fields or dynamical
interactions in young and old dense stellar environments. The measured masses
robustly demonstrate that relatively ""heavy"" black holes ($\gtrsim 25\,
M_\odot$) can form in nature. This discovery implies relatively weak
massive-star winds and thus the formation of GW150914 in an environment with
metallicity lower than $\sim 1/2$ of the solar value. The rate of binary
black-hole mergers inferred from the observation of GW150914 is consistent with
the higher end of rate predictions ($\gtrsim 1 \, \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \,
\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) from both types of formation models. The low measured
redshift ($z \sim 0.1$) of GW150914 and the low inferred metallicity of the
stellar progenitor imply either binary black-hole formation in a low-mass
galaxy in the local Universe and a prompt merger, or formation at high redshift
with a time delay between formation and merger of several Gyr. This discovery
motivates further studies of binary-black-hole formation astrophysics. It also
has implications for future detections and studies by Advanced LIGO and
Advanced Virgo, and gravitational-wave detectors in space.

high mass. This observation implies that the stochastic gravitational-wave
background from binary black holes, created from the incoherent superposition
of all the merging binaries in the Universe, could be higher than previously
expected. Using the properties of GW150914, we estimate the energy density of
such a background from binary black holes. In the most sensitive part of the
Advanced LIGO/Virgo band for stochastic backgrounds (near 25 Hz), we predict
$\Omega_\text{GW}(f=25 Hz) = 1.1_{-0.9}^{+2.7} \times 10^{-9}$ with 90\%
confidence. This prediction is robustly demonstrated for a variety of formation
scenarios with different parameters. The differences between models are small
compared to the statistical uncertainty arising from the currently poorly
constrained local coalescence rate. We conclude that this background is
potentially measurable by the Advanced LIGO/Virgo detectors operating at their
projected final sensitivity.

important role in the electron heating dynamics in Capacitively Coupled Radio
Frequency (CCRF) plasmas. In a combined approach of PIC/MCC simulations and a
theoretical model based on an equivalent circuit, we investigate the
self-excitation of PSR oscillations and their effect on the electron heating in
geometrically symmetric CCRF plasmas driven by multiple consecutive harmonics.
The discharge symmetry is controlled via the Electrical Asymmetry Effect, i.e.
by varying the total number of harmonics and tuning the phase shifts between
them. It is demonstrated that PSR oscillations will be self-excited under both
symmetric and asymmetric conditions, if (i) the charge-voltage relation of the
plasma sheaths deviates from a simple quadratic behavior and if (ii) the
inductance of the plasma bulk exhibits a temporal modulation. These two effects
have been neglected up to now, but we show that they must be included in the
model in order to properly describe the nonlinear series resonance circuit and
reproduce the self-excitation of PSR oscillations, which are observed in the
electron current density resulting from simulations of geometrically symmetric
CCRF plasmas. Furthermore, the effect of the PSR self-excitation on the
discharge current and the plasma properties, such as the potential profile, is
illustrated by applying Fourier analysis. High frequency oscillations in the
entire spectrum between the applied frequencies and the local electron plasma
frequency are observed. As a consequence, the electron heating is strongly
enhanced by the presence of PSR oscillations.

whether the test subject belongs to the healthy population. This method also
provides an estimate of the error rate associated with the decision and
provides a confidence interval for the point estimate of interest. Taken
together, this information will enable clinicians to conduct evidence-based
clinical decision making by directly comparing the observed measures with a
precalculated null distribution for such measures. Simulation studies show that
the proposed test performs satisfactorily under controlled conditions.

estimate model parameters based on published experimental data, as well as
bifurcation analysis to decipher the properties of the system in various

bifurcation techniques, we can also explain why the system is robust to genetic
mutations and molecular instabilities. These findings may provide

though the subsystem eigenvalues are mixed, this analysis avoids two common
objections to such a resolution, namely improper density operators and basis
ambiguity. Thus, entanglement transfers coherence from the superposed quantum
to correlations between the quantum and its measuring apparatus, permitting
instantaneous collapse without interrupting the global unitary evolution. This
resolves a key part of the measurement problem.

that the WN highest-weight representations in the fusion channels are

multiplicity in the fusion channel. The conformal blocks of these 4-point
functions involve matrix elements of a fully-degenerate primary field with a
highest-weight in the adjoint representation of sl3, and a semi-degenerate
primary field with a highest-weight in the fundamental representation of sl3.
We show that, when the fusion rules are obeyed, the matrix elements of the
fully-degenerate adjoint field, between two arbitrary descendant states, can be
computed explicitly, on equal footing with the matrix elements of the
semi-degenerate fundamental field. Using null-state conditions, we obtain a
fourth-order Fuchsian differential equation for the conformal blocks. Using
Okubo theory, we show that, due to the presence of multiplicities, this
differential equation belongs to a class of Fuchsian equations that is
different from those that have appeared so far in WN theories. We solve this

residual CP symmetries in the neutrino sector, which corresponds to all
possible semi-direct models based on a preserved $Z_2$ in the neutrino sector,
together with a CP symmetry, which constrains the PMNS matrix up to a single
free parameter which may be fixed by the reactor angle. We systematically study
and classify this case for all possible residual CP symmetries, and show that
the $R$-matrix is tightly constrained up to a single free parameter, with only
certain forms being consistent with successful leptogenesis, leading to
possible connections between leptogenesis and PMNS parameters. The formalism is
completely general in the sense that the two residual CP symmetries could
result from any high energy discrete flavour theory which respects any CP
symmetry. As a simple example, we apply the formalism to a high energy $S_4$
flavour symmetry with a generalized CP symmetry, broken to two residual CP
symmetries in the neutrino sector, recovering familiar results for PMNS

One plausible model is to interpret the $\gamma$-ray emission of GRBs and
optical emission of blazars as synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated
from the collision-induced magnetic dissipation regions in
Poynting-flux-dominated jets. The polarization observation is an important and
independent information to test this model. Based on our recent 3D relativistic
MHD simulations of collision-induced magnetic dissipation of magnetically
dominated blobs, here we perform calculations of the polarization properties of
the emission in the dissipation region and apply the results to model the
polarization observational data of GRB prompt emission and blazar optical
emission. We show that the same numerical model with different input parameters
can reproduce well the observational data of both GRBs and blazars, especially
the $90^{\circ}$ polarization angle (PA) change in GRB 100826A and the
$180^{\circ}$ PA swing in Blazar 3C279. This supports a unified model for GRB
and blazar jets, suggesting that collision-induced magnetic reconnection is a
common physical mechanism to power the relativistic jet emission from events
with very different black hole masses.

neutron star as seen from an observer at infinity is numerically calculable but
requires careful matching, first at the star's edge, between interior and
exterior solutions, none of them being totally Schwarzschild-like but
presenting instead small oscillations of the curvature scalar R; and second at
large radii, where the Newtonian potential is used to identify the mass of the
neutron star. We find that for the same equation of state, this mass definition
is always larger than its general relativistic counterpart. We exemplify this
with quadratic $R^2$ and Hu-Sawicki-like modifications of the standard General
Relativity action. Therefore, the finding of two-solar mass neutron stars
basically imposes no constraint on stable f(R) theories. However, star radii
are in general smaller than in General Relativity, which can give an
observational handle on such classes of models at the astrophysical level. Both
larger masses and smaller matter radii are due to much of the apparent
effective energy residing in the outer metric for scalar-tensor theories.
Finally, because the f(R) neutron star masses can be much larger than General
Relativity counterparts, the total energy available for radiating gravitational
waves could be of order several solar masses, and thus a merger of these stars
constitutes an interesting wave source.

is a notoriously difficult problem to solve efficiently in parallel---it is one
of the graph problems said to suffer from the transitive-closure bottleneck. In
practice, the $\Delta$-stepping algorithm of Meyer and Sanders (J. Algorithms,
2003) often works efficiently but has no known theoretical bounds on general
graphs. The algorithm takes a sequence of steps, each increasing the radius by
a user-specified value $\Delta$. Each step settles the vertices in its annulus
but can take $\Theta(n)$ substeps, each requiring $\Theta(m)$ work ($n$
vertices and $m$ edges).
  In this paper, we describe Radius-Stepping, an algorithm with the best-known
tradeoff between work and depth bounds for SSSP with nearly-linear
($\otilde(m)$) work. The algorithm is a $\Delta$-stepping-like algorithm but
uses a variable instead of fixed-size increase in radii, allowing us to prove a
bound on the number of steps. In particular, by using what we define as a
vertex $k$-radius, each step takes at most $k+2$ substeps. Furthermore, we
define a $(k, \rho)$-graph property and show that if an undirected graph has
this property, then the number of steps can be bounded by $O(\frac{n}{\rho}
\log \rho L)$, for a total of $O(\frac{kn}{\rho} \log \rho L)$ substeps, each
parallel. We describe how to preprocess a graph to have this property.
Altogether, Radius-Stepping takes $O((m+n\log n)\log \frac{n}{\rho})$ work and
$O(\frac{n}{\rho}\log n \log (\rho{}L))$ depth per source after preprocessing.
The preprocessing step can be done in $O(m\log n + n\rho^2)$ work and
$O(\rho^2)$ depth or in $O(m\log n + n\rho^2\log n)$ work and $O(\rho\log
\rho)$ depth, and adds no more than $O(n\rho)$ edges.

falls as $R^{-1}$, thus we expect the source counts to follow $dN/d\rho \propto
\rho^{-4}$. However, if gravitational waves decay as they propagate or
propagate into other dimensions, then there can be deviations from this generic
prediction. We consider the possibility that the strain falls as $R^{-\gamma}$,
where $\gamma=1$ recovers the expected predictions in a Euclidean
uniformly-filled universe, and forecast the sensitivity of future observations
to deviations from standard General Relativity. We first consider the case of
few objects, 7 sources, with a signal-to-noise from 8 to 24, and impose a lower
limit on $\gamma$, finding $\gamma>0.33$ at $95\%$ confidence level. The
distribution of our simulated sample is very consistent with the distribution
of the trigger events reported by Advanced LIGO. Future measurements will
improve these constraints: with 100 events, we estimate that $\gamma$ can be
measured with an uncertainty of $15\%$. We generalize the formalism to account
for a range of chirp masses and the possibility that the signal falls as
$\exp(-R/R_0)/R^\gamma$.

connected domain, whose laws are characterized by a natural conformal
invariance property. The set of points not surrounded by any CLE loop is a
natural random and conformally invariant analog of the Sierpinski gasket or
carpet.
  In the present paper, we derive a direct relationship between each CLE
consisting of simple disjoint loops (CLE($\kappa$) with $\kappa$ between 8/3
and 4) and the corresponding CLE($\kappa'$) where $\kappa':=16/\kappa$, a CLE
consisting of non-disjoint loops. This is the continuum analog of the
Edwards-Sokal coupling (between the q-state Potts model and the associated FK
random cluster model) and its generalization to non-integer q.
  Like its discrete analog, our continuum correspondence has two directions.
First, we show that one can construct (variants of) CLE($\kappa$) as follows:
sample a CLE($\kappa'$), then use a biased coin to independently color each
loop one of two colors, and then consider the outer boundaries of the clusters
of loops of a given color. Second, we show how to interpret CLE($\kappa'$)
loops as interfaces of a continuum analog of critical percolation within a
CLE($\kappa)$ carpet. This is the first description of continuous percolation
interfaces in fractal domains.
  These constructions provide new interpretations of the relationship between
CLEs and the Gaussian free field. Along the way, we obtain results about
generalized SLE$(\kappa;\rho)$ curves, and define a continuous family of
natural CLE variants called boundary conformal loop ensembles (BCLEs) that
share some (but not all) of the conformal symmetries that characterize CLEs,
and that should be scaling limits of critical models with special boundary
conditions. We extend the CLE correspondence to a BCLE correspondence that
makes sense for all $\kappa$ between 2 and 4.

show that we cannot enforce accountability if the dynamic network does not
allow for \emph{timely punishments}. In practice, this means for instance that
we cannot enforce accountability in some networks formed in file-sharing

applications such as secret exchange, where the benefits of the exchanges
significantly surpass the communication costs, timely punishments are enough to
enforce accountability. However, we cannot in general enforce accountability if
agents do not possess enough information about the network topology.

We find that in light of the hierarchy between the weak and Planck scales,
relaxion models are favoured by colossal Bayes-factors. Constraints upon \eg
the vacuum energy during relaxation, however, shrink the Bayes-factors such
that relaxion models are only slightly favoured. Including the bounds on

we augment our models with scalar-field inflation and consider measurements of
inflationary observables from BICEP/Planck. We find that, all told, the
Standard Model is favoured by huge Bayes-factors as the relaxion models require
fine-tuning such that the Hubble parameter is less than the height of the

inferences. We use the intrinsic algebra used in synthesis models, and we
explore how SFR can be inferred from the integrated light without any
assumption about the underling Star Formation history (SFH). We show that the
constant SFR approximation is actually a simplified expression of more deeper
characteristics of synthesis models: It is a characterization of the evolution
of single stellar populations (SSPs), acting the SSPs as sensitivity curve over
different measures of the SFH can be obtained. As results, we find that (1) the
best age to calibrate SFR indices is the age of the observed system (i.e. about
13Gyr for z=0 systems); (2) constant SFR and steady-state luminosities are not
requirements to calibrate the SFR; (3) it is not possible to define a SFR
single time scale over which the recent SFH is averaged, and we suggest to use
typical SFR indices (ionizing flux, UV fluxes) together with no typical ones
(optical/IR fluxes) to correct the SFR from the contribution of the old

results as the correlation of SFR time scales with galaxy colors, or the

various dynamical and radiative processes in the line-emitting region. The
level of these velocity shifts depends both on the line species and on quasar
properties. We study velocity shifts for the line peaks of various narrow and
broad quasar emission lines relative to systemic using a sample of 849 quasars
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping (SDSS-RM) project. The
coadded (from 32 epochs) spectra of individual quasars have sufficient
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to measure stellar absorption lines to provide
reliable systemic velocity estimates, as well as weak narrow emission lines.
The sample also covers a large dynamic range in quasar luminosity (~2 dex),
allowing us to explore potential luminosity dependence of the velocity shifts.
We derive average line peak velocity shifts as a function of quasar luminosity
for different lines, and quantify their intrinsic scatter. We further quantify
how well the peak velocity can be measured for various lines as a function of
continuum SNR, and demonstrate there is no systematic bias in the line peak
measurements when the spectral quality is degraded to as low as SNR~3 per SDSS
pixel. Based on the observed line shifts, we provide empirical guidelines on

of tidal dissipation and perturbations from a second, highly eccentric, outer
companion. Due to the special orbital configuration of the HAT-P-13 system, the
magnitude of HAT-P-13b's eccentricity ($e_b$) is in part dictated by its Love

$k_{2_b}$ and allows us to place otherwise elusive constraints on the mass of
HAT-P-13b's core ($M_{\rm{core,b}}$). In this study we derive new constraints
on the value of $e_b$ by observing two secondary eclipses of HAT-P-13b with the
Infrared Array Camera on board the $\textit{Spitzer Space Telescope}$. We fit
the measured secondary eclipse times simultaneously with radial velocity
measurements and find that $e_b = 0.00700 \pm 0.00100$. We then use
octupole-order secular perturbation theory to find the corresponding $k_{2_b} =
0.31^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$. Applying structural evolution models, we then find, with
68\% confidence, that $M_{\rm{core,b}}$ is less than 25 Earth masses

which is similar to the core mass theoretically required for runaway gas
accretion. This is the tightest constraint to date on the core mass of a hot

signatures of new physics that could be seen at ground and space-based
interferometers. We show that a first order phase transition in a dark sector
would lead to a detectable gravitational wave signal at future experiments, if
the phase transition has occurred at temperatures few orders of magnitude
higher than the electroweak scale. The source of gravitational waves in this
case is associated with the dynamics of expanding and colliding bubbles in the
early universe. At the same time we point out that topological defects, such as
dark sector domain walls, may generate a detectable signal already at aLIGO.
Both -- bubble and domain wall -- scenarios are sourced by semi-classical
configurations of a dark new physics sector. In the first case the
gravitational wave signal originates from bubble wall collisions and subsequent
turbulence in hot plasma in the early universe, while the second case
corresponds to domain walls passing through the interferometer at present and
is not related to gravitational waves. We find that aLIGO at its current
sensitivity can detect smoking-gun signatures from domain wall interactions,
while future proposed experiments including the fifth phase of aLIGO at design
sensitivity can probe dark sector phase transitions.

the Riesz-Dunford-functional calculus for holomorphic functions to quaternionic
linear operators and to $n$-tuples of noncommuting operators. For an unbounded
closed operator, it is defined, as in the classical case, using an appropriate
transformation and the $S$-functional calculus for bounded operators. This is
however only possible if the $S$-resolvent set of the operator contains a real
point.
  In this paper, we define the $S$-functional calculus directly via a Cauchy
integral, which allows us to consider also operators whose resolvent sets do
not contain real points. We show that the product rule and the spectral mapping
theorem also hold true with this definition and that the $S$-functional
calculus is compatible with polynomials, although polynomials are not included
in the set of admissible functions if the operator is unbounded.
  We also prove that the $S$-functional calculus is able to create spectral
projections. In order to do this, we remove another assumption usually made: we
do not assume that admissible functions are defined on slice domains. Instead,
we also consider functions that are defined on not necessarily connected sets.
This leads to an unexpected phenomenon: the $S$-functional calculi for left and
right slice hyperholomorphic functions become inconsistent and give different
operators for functions that are both left and right slice hyperholomorphic. We
show that any such function is the sum of a locally constant and an intrinsic
function. For intrinsic functions both functional calculi agree, but for
locally constant functions they must give different operators unless any
spectral projection commutes with arbitrary scalars.

aspects of vortices interacting with conformal pinning arrays and how they can
be used to create a flux flow diode effect for driving vortices in different
directions across the arrays. Under the application of an ac drive, a
pronounced vortex ratchet effect occurs where the vortices flow in the easy
direction of the array asymmetry. When the ac drive is applied perpendicular to
the asymmetry direction of the array, it is possible to realize a transverse
vortex ratchet effect where there is a generation of a dc flow of vortices
perpendicular to the ac drive due to the creation of a noise correlation
ratchet by the plastic motion of the vortices. We also examine vortex transport
simulations in experiments and compare the pinning effectiveness of conformal
arrays to uniform triangular pinning arrays. We find that a triangular array
generally pins the vortices more effectively at the first matching field and
below, while the conformal array is more effective at higher fields where

In zero field, there is no residual linear term in kappa(T) as T goes to 0 at

synchrotron emission by summing the fluxes from a vertical strip of zones
behind the reconfinement shock, which is nearly stationary, and from which a
substantial portion of the flux variability should arise. We explore a wide
range of time scales by considering two light curves from each simulation; one
uses a relativistic turbulence code with bulk velocities taken from our

fluctuations caused by variations in the Doppler boosting due to changes in the
direction and the speed of the flow through all zones in the strip. We then
calculate power spectral densities (PSDs) from the light curves for both
turbulent and bulk velocity origins for variability. The range of the power-law
slopes of the PSDs for the turbulence induced variations is -1.8 to -2.3, while
for the bulk velocity produced variations this range is -2.1 to -2.9; these are
in agreement with most observations. When superimposed, these power spectra
span a very large range in frequency (about five decades), with the turbulent
fluctuations yielding most of the shorter timescale variations and the bulk
flow changes dominating the longer periods.

neighbourhood. The present paper describes a framework for simulating the near
field on the computer. Assuming the LCDM model as a prior and applying the
Bayesian tools of the Wiener filter (WF) and constrained realizations of
Gaussian fields to the Cosmicflows-2 (CF2) survey of peculiar velocities,
constrained simulations of our cosmic environment are performed. The aim of
these simulations is to reproduce the LG and its local environment. Our main
result is that the LG is likely a robust outcome of the LCDM scenario when
subjected to the constraint derived from CF2 data, emerging in an environment
akin to the observed one. Three levels of criteria are used to define the
simulated LGs. At the base level, pairs of halos must obey specific isolation,
mass and separation criteria. At the second level the orbital angular momentum
and energy are constrained and on the third one the phase of the orbit is
constrained. Out of the 300 constrained simulations 146 LGs obey the first set
of criteria, 51 the second and 6 the third. The robustness of our LG factory
enables the construction of a large ensemble of simulated LGs. Suitable
candidates for high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of the LG can be
drawn from this ensemble, which can be used to perform comprehensive studies of
the formation of the LG

Monitor (GBM) is an excellent partner in the search for electromagnetic
counterparts to gravitational wave (GW) events. GBM observations at the time of
the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) event GW150914
reveal the presence of a weak transient above 50 keV, 0.4~s after the GW event,
with a false alarm probability of 0.0022 (2.9$\sigma$). This weak transient
lasting 1 s was not detected by any other instrument and does not appear
connected with other previously known astrophysical, solar, terrestrial, or
magnetospheric activity. Its localization is ill-constrained but consistent
with the direction of GW150914. The duration and spectrum of the transient
event are consistent with a weak short Gamma-Ray Burst arriving at a large
angle to the direction in which Fermi was pointing, where the GBM detector
response is not optimal. If the GBM transient is associated with GW150914, this
electromagnetic signal from a stellar mass black hole binary merger is
unexpected. We calculate a luminosity in hard X-ray emission between 1~keV and
10~MeV of $1.8^{+1.5}_{-1.0} \times 10^{49}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. Future joint
observations of GW events by LIGO/Virgo and Fermi GBM could reveal whether the
weak transient reported here is a plausible counterpart to GW150914 or a chance
coincidence, and will further probe the connection between compact binary
mergers and short Gamma-Ray Bursts.

most effective between individuals who have the ability to coordinate on a

only intend to coordinate if that actor believes the other group members have

difficult in uncertain environments if communication between actors is
unreliable and no prior agreements have been made. An important normative
question with regard to coordination in these ad hoc settings is therefore how
one can come to believe that other actors will coordinate, and with regard to
systems involving humans, an important empirical question is how humans arrive
at these expectations. We introduce an exact algorithm for computing the
infinitely recursive hierarchy of graded beliefs required for rational

multiagent coordination that uses it. Our algorithm is valid in any environment
with a finite state space, and extensions to certain countably infinite state

  strip. Exact results",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider two-dimensional Ising strip bounded by two planar, inhomogeneous
walls. The inhomogeneity of each wall is modeled by a magnetic field acting on
surface spins. It is equal to $+h_1$ except for a group of $N_1$ sites where it
is equal to $-h_1$. The inhomogeneities of the upper and lower wall are shifted
with respect to each other by a lateral distance $L$. Using exact
diagonalization of the transfer matrix, we study both the lateral and normal
critical Casimir forces as well as magnetization profiles for a wide range of
temperatures and system parameters. The lateral critical Casimir force tends to
reduce the shift between the inhomogeneities, and the excess normal force is
attractive. Upon increasing the shift $L$ we observe, depending on the
temperature, three different scenarios of breaking of the capillary bridge of
negative magnetization connecting the inhomogeneities of the walls across the
strip. As long as there exists a capillary bridge in the system, the magnitude
of the excess total critical Casimir force is almost constant, with its
direction depending on $L$. By investigating the bridge morphologies we have
found a relation between the point at which the bridge breaks and the
inflection point of the force. We provide a simple argument that some of the
properties reported here should also hold for a whole range of different models
of the strip with the same type of inhomogeneity.

more uniform than suggested in past works, with sigma(R(V)) = 0.18, and with
less than one percent of sight lines having R(V) > 4. Our data and analysis
have revealed two new aspects of Galactic extinction: first, we find
significant, wide-area variations in R(V) throughout the Galactic plane. These
variations are on scales much larger than individual molecular clouds,
indicating that R(V) variations must trace much more than just grain growth in

vision problem. To automatically describe face attributes from face containing

localization, facial descriptor construction, and attribute classification ---
in a pipeline. As a typical classification problem, face attribute prediction
has been addressed using deep learning. Current state-of-the-art performance
was achieved by using two cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which

In this paper, we experiment with an alternative way of employing the power of
deep representations from CNNs. Combining with conventional face localization
techniques, we use off-the-shelf architectures trained for face recognition to
build facial descriptors. Recognizing that the describable face attributes are
diverse, our face descriptors are constructed from different levels of the CNNs
for different attributes to best facilitate face attribute prediction.
Experiments on two large datasets, LFWA and CelebA, show that our approach is
entirely comparable to the state-of-the-art. Our findings not only demonstrate
an efficient face attribute prediction approach, but also raise an important

  (JCGS)",,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Minimax designs provide a uniform coverage of a design space $\mathcal{X}
\subseteq \mathbb{R}^p$ by minimizing the maximum distance from any point in
this space to its nearest design point. Although minimax designs have many
useful applications, e.g., for optimal sensor allocation or as space-filling
designs for computer experiments, there has been little work in developing
algorithms for generating these designs, due to its computational complexity.
In this paper, a new hybrid algorithm combining particle swarm optimization and
clustering is proposed for generating minimax designs on any convex and bounded
design space. The computation time of this algorithm scales linearly in
dimension $p$, meaning our method can generate minimax designs efficiently for
high-dimensional regions. Simulation studies and a real-world example show that
the proposed algorithm provides improved minimax performance over existing
methods on a variety of design spaces. Finally, we introduce a new type of
experimental design called a minimax projection design, and show that this
proposed design provides better minimax performance on projected subspaces of
$\mathcal{X}$ compared to existing designs. An efficient implementation of
these algorithms can be found in the R package minimaxdesign.

the properties of two-flavor and three-flavor quark matter are studied in the

Furthermore, the stability of magnetized quark matter with the running coupling

more stable than that of the conventional constant coupling case. It is
concluded that the magnetized strange quark matter described by running

The superconducting (SC) properties show a disparate behavior across a critical

superconductivity. The magnetoresistance for $H//ab$ and $H//c$ is very
different: for $H//c$, magnetic field induces and enhances a hump in the
resistivity close to the $T_c$ for pressures higher than 1.2 GPa, while it is
absent for $H//ab$. Since the measured {\mu}$_0$$H$$_{c2}$ for FeSe samples is
smaller than the orbital limited upper critical field ($H$$^{orb}$$_{c2}$)
estimated by the Werthamer Helfand and Hohenberg (WHH) model, the Maki
parameter ({\alpha}) related to Pauli spin-paramagnetic effects is additionally
considered to describe the temperature dependence of {\mu}$_0$$H$$_{c2}$($T$).
Interestingly, the {\alpha} value is hardly affected by pressure for $H//ab$,
while it strongly increases with pressure for $H//c$. The pressure evolution of
the {\mu}$_0$$H$$_{c2}$(0)s for the FeSe single crystals is found to be almost
similar to that of $T_c$($P$), suggesting that the pressure-induced magnetic

characterizes the helicity flipping rate. The rate is a non-monotonous function

physical causes for such large differences. We find that the observed IRX flux
ratios ($R_{IRX.obs}$) are related to the IRX morphology, with SNRs with the
largest $R_{IRX,obs}$ showing anticorrelated IRX morphology. By analyzing the
relation of $R_{IRX,obs}$ to X-ray and IR parameters, we show that the
$R_{IRX,obs}$ of some SNRs agree with theoretical ratios of SNR shocks in which
dust grains are heated and destroyed by collisions with plasma particles. For
the majority of SNRs, however, $R_{IRX,obs}$ values are either significantly
smaller or significantly larger than the theoretical ratios. The latter SNRs
have relatively low dust temperatures. We discuss how the natural and/or
environmental properties of SNRs could have affected the IRX flux ratios and
the IRX morphology of these SNRs. We conclude that the SNRs with largest
$R_{IRX,obs}$ are probably located in dense environment and that their IR
emission is from dust heated by shock radiation rather than by collisions. Our
result suggests that the IRX flux ratio, together with dust temperature, can be
used to infer the nature of unresolved SNRs in external galaxies.

impulsive, and decay phases. During the impulsive phase, it is believed that
the electrons and other particles are accelerated after the stored energy in
the magnetic field is released by reconnection. The impulsivity of a solar
flare is a quantifiable property that shows how quickly this initial energy
release occurs. It is measured via the impulsivity parameter, which we define
as the inverse of the overall duration of the impulsive phase. We take the
latter as the raw width of the most prominent nonthermal emission of the flare.
We computed this observable over a work sample of 48 M-class events that
occurred during the current Solar Cycle 24 by using three different methods.
The first method takes into account all of the nonthermal flare emission and
gives very accurate results, while the other two just cover fixed energy
intervals (30-40 keV and 25-50 keV) and are useful for fast calculations. We
propose an alternative way to classify solar flares according to their
impulsivity parameter values, defining three different types of impulsivity,
namely, high, medium, and low. This system of classification is independent of
the manner used to calculated the impulsivity parameter. Lastly, we show the
relevance of this tool as a discriminator of different HXR generation
processes.

large-gap are crucial for the realizations of dissipationless transport edge

(InBiCH3) has no dynamic instability, and host a QSH state with a band gap as
large as 0.29 eV, exhibiting an interesting electronic behavior viable for
room-temperature applications. The topological characteristic is confirmed by
s-pxy bands inversion, topological invariant Z2 number, and the time-reversal
symmetry protected helical edge states. Noticeably, the QSH states are tunable
and robust against the mechanical strain, electric field and different levels
of methyl coverages. We also find that InBiCH3 supported on h-BN substrate
maintains a nontrivial QSH state, which harbors the edge states lying within
the band gap of substrate. These findings demonstrate that the
methyl-functionalized III-V films may be a good QSH platform for device design

scientists and engineers and attempts are being made for its improvement.
Lubricating oil coated slippery surface for aqueous drops is one of the

make them useful for practical applications. Cloaking of water drops with thin
lubricant layer results in the loss of lubricant leading to deterioration of
slippery behavior. Surface roughness or porosity provides larger surface area
to the lubricating fluid and would to affect the stability of the lubricating
film. Here we report the effect of surface roughness, from tens of nanometer to
few microns, on the stability of slippery surface. Samples with small nanoscale
roughness show improved performance in terms of contact angle hysteresis,
critical tilt angle and slip velocity. Whereas large roughness samples show
poorer performance compared to small nanoscale roughness and smooth samples.
Small nanoscale roughness samples also show relatively slower deterioration
against loss of lubricant during water flow. Once completely lost, the slippery
behavior can be restored again simply by coating the sample again by the
lubricating fluid.

many phylogenetic reconstruction methods. In the case of bacteria, distances
can be estimated using a range of different evolutionary models, from single
nucleotide polymorphisms to large-scale genome rearrangements. In the case of
sequence evolution models (such as the Jukes-Cantor model and associated
metric) have been used to correct pairwise distances. Similar correction
methods for genome rearrangement processes are required to improve inference.
Current attempts at correction fall into 3 categories: Empirical computational
studies, Bayesian/MCMC approaches, and combinatorial approaches. Here we
introduce a maximum likelihood estimator for the inversion distance between a
pair of genomes, using the group-theoretic approach to modelling inversions
introduced recently. This MLE functions as a corrected distance: in particular,
we show that because of the way sequences of inversions interact with each
other, it is quite possible for minimal distance and MLE distance to
differently order the distances of two genomes from a third. This has obvious
implications for the use of minimal distance in phylogeny reconstruction. The
work also tackles the above problem allowing free rotation of the genome.
Generally a frame of reference is locked, and all computation made accordingly.
This work incorporates the action of the dihedral group so that distance
estimates are free from any a priori frame of reference.

detection rules in which the statistician is allowed to make an early decision
on the alternative hypothesis opportunistically based on the sequentially
observed samples. From a sequential decision perspective, ODRs are also
mixtures of one-sided and truncated sequential detection rules. Several results
regarding ODRs are established in this paper. In the finite regime, the maximum
sample size is modeled either as a fixed finite number, or a geometric random
variable with a fixed finite mean. For both cases, the corresponding Bayesian
formulations are investigated. The former case is a slight variation of the
well-known finite-length sequential hypothesis testing procedure in the
literature, whereas the latter case is new, for which the Bayesian optimal ODR
is shown to be a sequence of likelihood ratio threshold tests with two
different thresholds: a running threshold, which is determined by solving a
stationary state equation, is used when future samples are still available, and
a terminal threshold (simply the ratio between the priors scaled by costs) is
used when the statistician reaches the final sample and thus has to make a
decision immediately. In the asymptotic regime, the tradeoff among the
exponents of the (false alarm and miss) error probabilities and the normalized
expected stopping time under the alternative hypothesis is completely
characterized and proved to be tight, via an information-theoretic argument.
Within the tradeoff region, one noteworthy fact is that the performance of the
Stein-Chernoff Lemma is attainable by ODRs.

apply the new formula to apparent horizons of Friedmann expanding universes
with zero, negative and positive spatial curvature. As a first result, we found
that, apart from the static Einstein solution, the only Friedmann spacetimes
with constant (zero) internal energy are the ones with zero spatial curvature.
This happens because, in the computation of the internal energy $U$, the
contribution due to the non-vanishing Hubble flow must been added to the usual
Misner-Sharp energy giving, for zero curvature spacetimes, a zero value for
$U$. This fact does not hold when curvature is present. After analyzing the
free energy $F$, we obtain the correct result that $F$ is stationary only for
physical systems in isothermal equilibrium, i.e. a de Sitter expanding
universe. This result permits us to trace back a physically reasonable
hypothesis concerning the origin of the early and late times de Sitter phase of
our universe. Finally, we deduce an interesting temperature-length inequality
similar to the time-energy uncertainty of ordinary quantum mechanics but with
temperature instead of time coordinate. Remarkably, this relation is
independent on the gravitational constant $G$ and can thus be explored also in
non gravitational contexts.

macroscopic approach, a four parameter family of integrable extended van der
Waals models is indeed constructed in such a way that the equation of state is
a solution to an integrable nonlinear conservation law linearisable by a
Cole-Hopf transformation. This family is further specified by the request that,
in regime of high temperature, far from the critical region, the extended model
reproduces asymptotically the standard van der Waals equation of state. We
provide a detailed comparison of our extended model with two notable empirical
models such as Peng-Robinson and Soave's modification of the Redlich-Kwong
equations of state. We show that our extended van der Waals equation of state
is compatible with both empirical models for a suitable choice of the free

reveal the conjugate symmetry of the Ramanujan subspace with a set of complex
exponential basis functions and represent the subspace as the union of a series
of conjugate subspaces. With these conjugate subspaces, the signal periodic
model is introduced to characterize the periodic structure of a signal. To
achieve the decomposition of the proposed model, the conjugate subspace
matching pursuit (CSMP) algorithm is proposed based on two different greedy
strategies. The CSMP is performed iteratively in two stages. In the first
stage, the dominant hidden period is chosen with the periodicity strategy.
Then, the dominant conjugate subspace is chosen with the energy strategy in the
second stage. Compared with the current state-of-the-art methods for hidden
period identification, the main advantages provided by the CSMP are the
following: (i) the capability of identifying all the hidden periods in the
range from $1$ to the maximum hidden period $Q$ of a signal of any length,
without truncating the signal; (ii) the ability to identify the time-varying
hidden period with its shifted version; and (iii) the low computational cost,
without generating and using a large over-complete dictionary. Moreover, we
provide examples and applications to demonstrate the abilities of the proposed
two-stage CSMP algorithm, which include hidden period identification, signal
approximation, time-varying period detection, and pitch detection of speech.

be produced by growing graphene on hexagonal boron nitride or silicon carbide.
In this work, we investigate transport property in a SOI/SSB/SOI gapped

that, lattice-pseudospin polarization (L-PSP) can be controlled perfectly from
+100% to -100% by gate voltage. This is due to the fact that in graphene grown
on WS2, the carriers carry lattice-pseudo spin degree of freedom ""up and down"".
The SSB-gapped graphene exhibits pseudo-ferromagnetism to play the role of
lattice-pseudospin filtering barrier. It is also found that the SOI and
SSB-gaps in graphene may be measured by characteristic of L-PSP in the

H-colourings of a graph. We discover a natural graph-theoretic trichotomy based
on the structure of the graph H. If H is an irreflexive bipartite graph or a
reflexive complete graph then counting list H-colourings is trivially in
polynomial time. Otherwise, if H is an irreflexive bipartite permutation graph
or a reflexive proper interval graph then approximately counting list
H-colourings is equivalent to #BIS, the problem of approximately counting
independent sets in a bipartite graph. This is a well-studied problem which is
believed to be of intermediate complexity -- it is believed that it does not
have an FPRAS, but that it is not as difficult as approximating the most
difficult counting problems in #P. For every other graph H, approximately
counting list H-colourings is complete for #P with respect to
approximation-preserving reductions (so there is no FPRAS unless NP=RP). Two
pleasing features of the trichotomy are (i) it has a natural formulation in
terms of hereditary graph classes, and (ii) the proof is largely self-contained
and does not require any universal algebra (unlike similar dichotomies in the
weighted case). We are able to extend the hardness results to the
bounded-degree setting, showing that all hardness results apply to input graphs
with maximum degree at most 6.

a lot of attention in many applications, especially those with high dimensional

maximization problem, existing approaches formulate this problem by adding a
penalty term into the objective function that encourages a sparse solution.
However, the resulting methods achieve sparsity at the expense of sacrificing
the orthogonality property. In this paper, we develop a new method to estimate
dominant sparse eigenvectors without trading off their orthogonality. The
problem is highly non-convex and hard to handle. We apply the MM framework
where we iteratively maximize a tight lower bound (surrogate function) of the
objective function over the Stiefel manifold. The inner maximization problem
turns out to be a rectangular Procrustes problem, which has a closed form
solution. In addition, we propose a method to improve the covariance estimation
problem when its underlying eigenvectors are known to be sparse. We use the
eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix to formulate an optimization
problem where we impose sparsity on the corresponding eigenvectors. Numerical
experiments show that the proposed eigenvector extraction algorithm matches or
outperforms existing algorithms in terms of support recovery and explained
variance, while the covariance estimation algorithms improve significantly the

lasing from higher multi-exciton states of a few quantum dot-photonic crystal
nanocavity. We show that the photon output is fed from saturable quantum
emitters rather than a non-saturable background despite being rather
insensitive to the spectral position of the mode. Although the exciton
transitions of each quantum dot are detuned by up to $160$ cavity linewidths,
we observe that strong excitation populates a multitude of closely spaced
multi-exciton states, which partly overlap spectrally with the mode. The
limited number of emitters is confirmed by a complete saturation of the mode
intensity at strong pumping, providing sufficient gain to reach stimulated
emission, whilst being accompanied by a distinct lasing threshold. Detailed
second-order photon-correlation measurements unambiguously identify the
transition to lasing for strong pumping and, most remarkably, reveal
super-thermal photon bunching with $g^{(2)}(0)>2$ below lasing threshold. Based
on our microscopic theory, a pump-rate dependent $\beta$-factor $\beta(P)$ is
needed to describe the nanolaser and account for the interplay of multi-exciton
transitions in the few-emitter gain medium. Moreover, we theoretically predict
that the super-thermal bunching is related to dipole-anticorrelated
multi-exciton recombination channels via sub- and super-radiant coupling below
and above lasing threshold, respectively. Our results provide new insights into
the microscopic light-matter-coupling of spatially separated emitters coupled
to a common cavity mode and, thus, provides a complete understanding of
stimulated emission in nanolasers with discrete emitters.

beginning to understand how QCD builds the basic bricks for nuclei: neutrons,
protons, and the pions that bind them. QCD is characterised by two emergent
phenomena: confinement & dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB). They are
expressed with great force in the character of the pion. In turn, pion
properties suggest that confinement & DCSB are closely connected. As both a
Nambu-Goldstone boson and a quark-antiquark bound-state, the pion is unique in
Nature. Developing an understanding of its properties is thus critical to
revealing basic features of the Standard Model. We describe experimental
progress in this direction, made using electromagnetic probes, highlighting
both improvements in the precision of charged-pion form factor data, achieved
in the past decade, and new results on the neutral-pion transition form factor.
Both challenge existing notions of pion structure. We also provide a
theoretical context for these empirical advances, first explaining how DCSB
works to guarantee that the pion is unnaturally light; but also, nevertheless,
ensures the pion is key to revealing the mechanisms that generate nearly all
the mass of hadrons. Our discussion unifies the charged-pion elastic and
neutral-pion transition form factors, and the pion's twist-2 parton
distribution amplitude. It also indicates how studies of the charged-kaon form
factor can provide significant contributions. Importantly, recent predictions
for the large-$Q^2$ behaviour of the pion form factor can be tested by
experiments planned at JLab 12. Those experiments will extend precise
charged-pion form factor data to momenta that can potentially serve in
validating factorisation theorems in QCD, exposing the transition between the
nonperturbative and perturbative domains, and thereby reaching a goal that has
long driven hadro-particle physics.

regarding the assembly history of their host galaxies. Motivated by the
detection of a significant rotation signal in the outer halo GC system of M31,
we investigate the likelihood of detecting such a rotation signal in
projection, using cosmological simulations. To this end we select subsets of
tagged particles in the halos of the Aquarius simulations to represent mock GC
systems, and analyse their kinematics. We find that GC systems can exhibit a
non-negligible rotation signal provided the associated stellar halo also has a
net angular momentum. The ability to detect this rotation signal is highly
dependent on the viewing perspective, and the probability of seeing a signal
larger than that measured in M31 ranges from 10% to 90% for the different halos
in the Aquarius suite. High values are found from a perspective such that the
projected angular momentum of the GC system is within 40 deg of the rotation
axis determined via the projected positions and line-of-sight velocities of the
GCs. Furthermore, the true 3D angular momentum of the outer stellar halo is
relatively well aligned, within 35 deg, with that of the mock GC systems. We
argue that the net angular momentum in the mock GC systems arises naturally
when the majority of the material is accreted from a preferred direction,
namely along the dominant dark matter filament of the large-scale structure
that the halos are embedded in. This, together with the favourable edge-on view
of M31's disk suggests that it is not a coincidence that a large rotation

Collaborations on the hadronic matrix elements entering $\Delta M_{s,d}$ in
$B_{s,d}^0-\bar B_{s,d}^0$ mixing, we determine the Universal Unitarity
Triangle (UUT) in models with Constrained Minimal Flavour Violation (CMFV). Of
particular importance are the very precise determinations of the ratio
$|V_{ub}|/|V_{cb}|=0.0864\pm0.0025$ and of the angle $\gamma=(63.0\pm
2.1)^\circ$. They follow in this framework from the experimental values of
$\Delta M_{d}/\Delta M_s$ and of the CP-asymmetry $S_{\psi K_S}$. As in CMFV
models the new contributions to meson mixings can be described by a single
flavour-universal variable $S(v)$, we next determine the CKM matrix elements
$|V_{ts}|$, $|V_{td}|$, $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$ as functions of $S(v)$ using
the experimental value of $\Delta M_s$ as input. The lower bound on $S(v)$ in
these models, derived by us in 2006, implies then upper bounds on these four
CKM elements and on the CP-violating parameter $\varepsilon_K$, which turns out
to be significantly below its experimental value. This strategy avoids the use
of tree-level determinations of $|V_{ub}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$ that are presently
subject to considerable uncertainties. On the other hand if $\varepsilon_K$ is
used instead of $\Delta M_s$ as input, $\Delta M_{s,d}$ are found significantly
above the data. In this manner we point out that the new lattice data have
significantly sharpened the tension between $\Delta M_{s,d}$ and
$\varepsilon_K$ within the CMFV framework. This implies the presence of new
physics contributions beyond this framework that are responsible for the
breakdown of the flavour universality of the function $S(v)$. We also present
the implications of these results for $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$,
$K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$ and $B_{s,d}\to\mu^+\mu^-$ within the Standard Model.

quasar PDS 456, covering a total duration of ~1 Ms and a net exposure of 455
ks. During these observations, the X-ray flux was suppressed by a factor of >10
in the soft X-ray band when compared to other epochs. We investigated the
broadband continuum by constructing a spectral energy distribution, making use
of the optical/UV photometry and hard X-ray spectra from the later
XMM-Newton/NuSTAR campaign in 2014. The high energy part of this low flux state
cannot be accounted for by self-consistent accretion disc and corona models
without attenuation by absorbing gas, which partially covers a substantial
fraction of the line of sight towards the X-ray source. Two absorption layers
are required, of column density $\log (N_{\rm{H,low}}/{\rm
cm^{-2}})=22.3\pm0.1$ and $\log (N_{\rm{H,high}}/{\rm cm^{-2}})=23.2\pm0.1$,
with average covering factors of ~80% (with typical 5% variations) and 60%
($\pm$10-15%), respectively. In these observations PDS 456 displays significant
short term X-ray spectral variability, on timescales of ~100 ks, which can be
accounted for by variable covering of the absorbing gas. The partial covering
absorber prefers an outflow velocity of $v_{\rm pc} = 0.25^{+0.01}_{-0.05}c$ at
the >99.9% confidence level over the case where $v_{\rm pc}=0$. This is
consistent with the velocity of the highly ionised outflow responsible for the
blueshifted iron K absorption profile. We therefore suggest that the partial
covering clouds could be the denser, or clumpy part of an inhomogeneous
accretion disc wind. Finally we estimate the size-scale of the X-ray source
from its variability. The radial extent of the X-ray emitter is found to be of
the order ~15-20 $R_{\rm g}$, although the hard X-ray (>2 keV) emission may
originate from a more compact or patchy corona of hot electrons, which is ~6-8
$R_{\rm g}$ in size.

methods to solve linear equations in Hilbert spaces. So far, they have been
inherently bound to these spaces since they make use of the inner product
structure. In more general Banach spaces one of the most prominent iterative
solvers are Landweber-type methods that essentially resemble the Steepest
Descent method applied to the normal equation. More advanced are subspace
methods that take up the idea of a Krylov-type search space, wherein an optimal
solution is sought. However, they do not share the conjugacy property with CG
methods. In this article we propose that the Sequential Subspace Optimization
(SESOP) method can be considered as an extension of CG methods to Banach
spaces. We employ metric projections to orthogonalize the current search
direction with respect to the search space from the last iteration. For the
l2-space our method then exactly coincides with the Polak-Ribi\`ere type of the
CG method when applied to the normal equation. We show that such an
orthogonalized search space still leads to weak convergence of the subspace
method. Moreover, numerical experiments on a random matrix toy problem and 2D
computerized tomography on lp-spaces show superior convergence properties over
all p compared to non-orthogonalized search spaces. This especially holds for
lp-spaces with small p. We see that the closer we are to an l2-space, the more
we recover of the conjugacy property that holds in these spaces, i. e., as
expected, the more the convergence behaves independently of the size of the
truncated search space.

  ""General Relativity Conflict and Rivalries: Einstein's Polemics with
  Physicists""",,,,"physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In his 1916 ground-breaking general relativity paper Einstein had imposed a
restrictive coordinate condition, his field equations were valid for coordinate
systems which are unimodular. Later, Einstein published a paper on
gravitational waves. The solution presented in this paper did not satisfy the
above restrictive condition. In his gravitational waves paper, Einstein
concluded that gravitational fields propagate at the speed of light. The
solution is the Minkowski flat metric plus a small disturbance propagating in a
flat spacetime. Einstein calculated the small deviation from Minkowski metric
in a manner analogous to that of retarded potentials in electrodynamics.
However, in obtaining the above derivation, Einstein made a mathematical error.
This error caused him to obtain three different types of waves compatible with
his approximate field equations: longitudinal waves, transverse waves and a new
type of wave. Einstein added an Addendum in which he suggested that in systems
in unimodular coordinates only waves of the third type occur and these waves
transport energy. He became obsessed with his unimodular coordinates.
Einstein's colleagues demonstrated to him that in the coordinate system in
unimodular coordinates the gravitational wave of a mass point carry no energy,
but Einstein tried to persuade them that he had actually not made a mistake in
his gravitational waves paper. Einstein, however, eventually accepted his
colleagues results and dropped the restrictive unimodular coordinates. This
finally led him to discover plane transverse gravitational waves.

  We prove that the weak rate of convergence is twice the strong rate of
convergence in two situations. First, we assume that the covariance operator
commutes with the generator of the semigroup: the first order term in the weak
error expansion cancels out thanks to an independence property. Second, we
remove the commuting assumption, and extend the previous result, thanks to the
analysis of a new error term depending on a commutator.

the quarter law at the level of groups. At the individual level, it appears
that the quarter law could be refined in order to reflect individual
characteristics. This article revisits the formalism of QDT along a concrete
example and offers a practical guide to researchers who are interested in
applying QDT to a dataset of binary lotteries in the domain of gains.

focus on the simplest case of aqueous sodium chloride at ambient conditions and
discuss the two main factors that have impeded progress. The first is lack of

emphasize the importance of distinguishing between ""Training Set Properties""

solubility results obtained, even using identical FFs and thermodynamic
conditions. Solubility calculations have been approached using both
thermodynamic--based methods and direct molecular dynamics--based methods
implementing coexisting solution and solid phases. Although convergence has
been very recently achieved among results based on the former approach, there
is as yet no general agreement with simulation results based on the latter
methodology. We also propose a new method to directly calculate the electrolyte
standard chemical potential in the Henry-Law ideality model. We conclude by
making recommendations for calculating solubility, chemical potentials and
activity coefficients, and outline a potential path for future progress.

  Methods: We use a self-similar approach to simplify the partial differential

numerical standard procedures.
  Results: We find a self-similar solution for the dynamical evolution of
self-gravitating {\alpha}-disks and derive the significant quantities. In the
Keplerian part of the disk our model is consistent with standard stationary
{\alpha}-disk theory, and self-consistent throughout the self-gravitating
regime. Positive accretion rates throughout the disk demand a high degree of
self-gravitation. Combined with the temporal decline of the accretion rate and
its low amount, the model prohibits the growth of large central masses.
  Conclusions: {\alpha}-viscosity cannot account for the evolution of the whole
mass spectrum of super-massive black holes (SMBH) in AGN. However, considering

employed, are 2.27, 1.81, 1.56 times higher than the ones with base fluid,
respectively. However, with increasing bottom wall temperature, the Nusselt

transfer capability of coolant at temperatures over the melting range of PCM
particles due to partial melting of nanoparticles in this range. While, the
latter phenomena is due to the lower capability of NEPCM particles and
consequently coolant in absorbing heat at coolant temperatures higher than the

has a drastic effect on Euler number, and with increasing volume fraction and

by observing the Ramsey-type oscillations of the ion spin states. Three quantum
probes are considered, which are represented by systems obeying the
Jaynes-Cummings, quantum Rabi (in 1D) and Jahn-Teller (in 2D) models. By using
dynamical decoupling schemes in the Jaynes-Cummings and Jahn-Teller models, our
force sensing protocols can be made robust to the spin dephasing caused by the
thermal and magnetic field fluctuations. In the quantum-Rabi probe, the
residual spin-phonon coupling vanishes, which makes this sensing protocol
naturally robust to thermally-induced spin dephasing. We show that the proposed
techniques can be used to sense the axial and transverse components of the
force with a sensitivity beyond the yN $/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ range, i.e. in the

simulating non-adiabatic dynamics with quantum effects of the nuclei is put
forward.
  The time-dependent Schr\""{o}dinger equation for the motion of the nuclei is
solved in a moving basis set. The basis set is guided by classical
trajectories, which can hop stochastically between different electronic
potential energy surfaces. The non-adiabatic transitions are modelled by a
modified version of Tully's fewest switches algorithm. The trajectories consist
of Gaussians in the phase space of the nuclei (coherent states) combined with
amplitudes for an electronic wave function. The time-dependent matrix elements
between different coherent states determine the amplitude of each trajectory in
the total multistate wave function; the diagonal matrix elements determine the
hopping probabilities and gradients. In this way, both intereference effects
and non-adiabatic transitions can be described in a very compact fashion,
leading to the exact solution if convergence with respect to the number of
trajectories is achieved and the potential energy surfaces are known globally.
  The method is tested on a 2D model for a conical intersection [J. Chem.
Phys., 1996, 104, p. 5517], where a nuclear wavepacket encircles the point of
degeneracy between two potential energy surfaces and intereferes with itself.
These intereference effects are absent in classical trajectory-based molecular
dynamics but can be fully incorporated if trajectories are replaced by surface
hopping coupled coherent states.

injection of new basic individual operating ideas that occurs through coupling
of science and technology simulations.

a rather thoroughfull series of five papers by Cockburn and Shu in the late
80's [7, 5, 9, 6, 8]. Then, the fame of the method, which could be seen as a
compromise between Finite Elements (the center of the method being a weak
formulation) and Finite Volumes (the basis functions are defined cell-wise, the
cells being the elements of the primal mesh) increased and slowly investigated
successfully all the domains of Partial Differential Equations numerical
integration. In particular, one can cite the ground papers for the common
treatment of convection-diffusion equations [4, 3] or the treatment of pure
elliptic equations [2, 17]. For more information on the history of
Discontinuous Galerkin method, please refer to section 1.1 of [15]. Today, DG
methods are widely used in all kind of manners and have applications in almost
all fields of applied mathematics. (TODO: cite applications and
structured/unstructured meshes, steady/unsteady, etc...). The methods is now
mature enough to deserve entire text books, among which I cite a reference book
on Nodal DG Methods by Henthaven and Warburton [15] with the ground basis of DG
integration, numerical analysis of its linear behavior and generalization to
multiple dimensions. Lately, since 2010, thanks to a ground work of Zhang and
Shu [26, 27, 25, 28, 29], Discontinuous Galerkin methods are eventually able to
combine high order accuracy and certain preservation of convex constraints,
such as the positivity of a given quantity, for example. These new steps
forward are very promising since it brings us very close to the ""Ultimate

Furthermore, we give a counter-example of a conjecture of Strichartz on the
existence of higher order weak tangents.

  information: 21 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables",,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.flu-dyn physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Liquid dispensing and writing in the extremely small size regime are
important for applications in many current technologies, such as micro/nano
fabrication, biological/chemical patterning and analysis, and drug discovery.
Most of current dispensing/writing methods can be sorted into a category of
liquid flowing through tiny tubes or nozzles that requires inputting an impulse
energy, which leads to complex procedures, expensive equipment and narrow
material applicability, especially for biomaterials. Here, we report a method
that may lead to a new category: liquid flows over the tapered surface of a pin
with longitudinal nano grooves on the surface to uninterruptedly perform
droplet dispensing and direct writing. The dispensed droplet diameters were
controllable from several microns down to 150 nm, and the written line heights
were as low as 5 nm. The mechanism underlying automatic liquid storage on
conical surface and spontaneous liquid transport through nano grooves is
revealed and well modeled by a simple relationship. Furthermore, the
nano-grooved pins are much simpler and cheaper in fabrication than nanoscale
tubes and nozzles, and pins have much depressed clogging problems that are
typically troublesome for tubes and nozzles. Our new strategy may constitute a
basis for creating liquid dispensing/writing technologies that are
simultaneously smaller, simpler, faster and applicable for more types of
materials.

often used to describe neural networks. Recently, new mathematical results have
provided a better understanding of them. It has been proved that a fully
excitatory network can blow-up in finite time, while a fully inhibitory network
has a global in time solution for any initial data. A general description of
the steady states of a purely excitatory or inhibitory network has been also
given. We extend this study to the system composed of an excitatory population
and an inhibitory one. We prove that this system can also blow-up in finite
time and analyse its steady states and long time behaviour. Besides, we
illustrate our analytical description with some numerical results. The main
tools used to reach our aims are: the control of an exponential moment for the
blow-up results, a more complicate strategy than that considered in C\'aceres,
Carrillo and Perthame (2011), for studying the number of steady states, entropy
methods combined with Poincar\'e inequalities for the long time behaviour and,
finally, high order numerical schemes together with parallel computation
techniques in order to obtain our numerical results.

using a path integral formulation. A path integral has a well-known statistical
mechanical interpretation in connection with a canonical ensemble. In this
sense, a path integral describes the thermodynamic equilibrium of a local
system in a thermal bath. This interpretation is in contrast to solutions of
Einstein's Equations which depart from local thermodynamical equilibrium (one
example is shown explicitly). For this reason, we examine an extension of the
path integral model to a (locally) non-equilibrium description. As a
non-equilibrium description, we propose to use a global microcanonical ensemble
with constraints. The constraints reduce the set of admissible microscopic
states to be consistent with the macroscopic geometry. We also analyse the
relation between the microcanonical description and a statistical approach not
based on dynamical assumptions which has been proposed recently. This analysis
is of interest for the test of consistency of the non-equilibrium description
with general relativity and quantum field theory.

computer can have pleasure and pain, what pleasure (and intensity of pleasure)
is, and, ultimately, what concepts of emotion are.
  To determine what an emotion is, is a matter of conceptualization, namely,
understanding and explicitly encoding the concept of emotion as people use it
in everyday life. This is a notoriously difficult problem (Frijda, 1986, Fehr
\& Russell, 1984). This paper firstly shows why this is a difficult problem by
aligning it with the conceptualization of a few other so called semantic
primitives such as ""EXIST"", ""FORCE"", ""BIG"" (plus ""LIMIT""). The definitions of
these thought-to-be-indefinable concepts, given in this paper, show what formal
definitions of concepts look like and how concepts are constructed. As a
by-product, owing to the explicit account of the meaning of ""exist"", the famous
dispute between Einstein and Bohr is naturally resolved from linguistic point
of view. Secondly, defending Frijda's view that emotion is action tendency (or
Ryle's behavioral disposition (propensity)), we give a list of emotions defined
in terms of action tendency. In particular, the definitions of pleasure and the
feeling of beauty are presented.
  Further, we give a formal definition of ""action tendency"", from which the
concept of ""intensity"" of emotions (including pleasure) is naturally derived in
a formal fashion. The meanings of ""wish"", ""wait"", ""good"", ""hot"" are analyzed.
