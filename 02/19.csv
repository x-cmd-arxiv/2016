from a strongly-interacting sector. Fermion mass generation is possible through
partial compositeness accompanied by the appearance of new heavy fermionic
resonances. The Higgs couplings to the Standard Model (SM) particles and
between the Higgs bosons themselves are modified with respect to the SM. Higgs
pair production is sensitive to the trilinear Higgs self-coupling but also to
anomalous couplings like the novel 2-Higgs-2-fermion coupling emerging in
composite Higgs models. The QCD corrections to SM Higgs boson pair production
are known to be large. In this paper we compute, in the limit of heavy loop
particle masses, the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections to Higgs pair
production in composite Higgs models without and with new heavy fermions. The
relative QCD corrections are found to be almost insensitive both to the
compositeness of the Higgs boson and to the details of the heavy fermion
spectrum, since the leading order cross section dominantly factorizes. With the
obtained results we investigate the question if, taking into account Higgs
coupling constraints, new physics could first be seen in Higgs pair production.
We find this to be the case in the high-luminosity option of the LHC for
composite Higgs models with heavy fermions. We also investigate the invariant
mass distributions at NLO QCD. While they are sensitive to the Higgs
non-linearities and hence anomalous couplings, the influence of the heavy
fermions is much less pronounced.

be stored in the routers. Bloom-filter based source-routed multicast remedies
this problem by moving the state from the routers to the packets. However, a
fixed sized Bloom-filter can only store a limited number of items before the
false positive ratio grows too high implying scalability issues. Several
proposals have tried to address these scalability issues in Bloom-filter
forwarding. These proposals, however, unnecessarily increase the forwarding
complexity.
  In this paper, we present Extensible-Bloom-filter (XBF), a new framing and
forwarding solution which effectively circumvents the aforementioned drawbacks.
XBF partitions a network into sub-networks that reflect the network topology
and traffic patterns, and uses a separate fixed-length Bloom-filter in each of
these. We formulate this partition assignment problem into a balanced edge
partitioning problem, and evaluate it with simulations on realistic topologies.
Our results show that XBF scales to very large networks with minimal overhead
and completely eliminates the false-positives that have plagued the traditional
Bloom-filter-based forwarding protocols. It furthermore integrates with SDN
environments, making it highly suitable for deployments in off-the-shelf
SDN-based networks.

that the thresholding scheme preserves the structure of (multi-phase) mean

Sturzenhecker, ours is a conditional convergence result, which means that we
have to assume that the time-integrated energy of the approximation converges

on super-luminous SNe IIn and perform axially-symmetric (i.e., 2D) multi-group
radiation hydrodynamics simulations to explore the impact of an imposed large
scale density asymmetry. When the CSM is asymmetric, the latitudinal variation
of the radial optical depth $\tau$ introduces a strong flux redistribution from
the higher-density CSM regions, where the shock luminosity is larger, towards
the lower-density CSM regions where photons escape more freely --- this
redistribution ceases when $\tau<$1. Along directions where the CSM density is
larger, the shock deceleration is stronger and its progression slower,
producing a non-spherical cold-dense shell (CDS). For an oblate CSM density
distribution, the photosphere (CDS) has an oblate (prolate) morphology when
$\tau>$1. When the CSM is symmetric and the ejecta asymmetric, the flux
redistribution within the CSM now tends to damp the latitudinal variation of
the luminosity at the shock. It then requires a larger ejecta asymmetry to
produce a sizeable latitudinal variation in the emergent flux. When the
interaction is between a SN ejecta and a relic disk, the luminosity boost at
early times scales with the disk opening angle -- forming a super-luminous SN
IIn this way requires an unrealistically thick disk. In contrast, interaction
with a disk of modest thickness/mass can yield a power that rivals radioactive
decay of a standard SN II at nebular times.

However, the mechanism of this mass loss is not yet known. Here, we investigate
the qualitative behaviour of theoretical stellar wind mass-loss as a function
of Teff across two bi-stability jumps in blue supergiant regime and also in
proximity to the Eddington limit, relevant for LBVs. To investigate the
physical ingredients that play a role in the radiative acceleration we
calculate blue supergiant wind models with the CMFGEN non-LTE model atmosphere
code over an effective temperature range between 30000 and 8800 K. Although our
aim is not to provide new mass-loss rates for BA supergiants, we study and
confirm the existence of two bi-stability jumps in mass-loss rates predicted by
Vink, de Koter, & Lamers (1999). However, they are found to occur at somewhat
lower Teff (20000 and 9000 K, respectively) than found previously, which would
imply that stars may evolve towards lower Teff before strong mass-loss is
induced by the bi-stability jumps. When the combined effects of the second
bi-stability jump and the proximity to Eddington limit are accounted for, we
find a dramatic increase in the mass-loss rate by up to a factor of 30. Further
investigation of both bi-stability jumps is expected to lead to a better
understanding of discrepancies between empirical modelling and theoretical
mass-loss rates reported in the literature, and to provide key inputs for the
evolution of both normal AB supergiants and LBVs, as well as their subsequent
supernova type II explosions.

Although this behaviour known as modal gating has been observed for a long time
it is currently not well understood. Despite the fact that appropriately
representing activity changes is essential for accurately capturing time course
data from ion channels, systematic approaches for modelling modal gating are
currently not available. In this paper, we develop a modular approach for
building such a model in an iterative process. First, stochastic switching
between modes and stochastic opening and closing within modes are represented
in separate aggregated Markov models. Second, the continuous-time hierarchical
Markov model, a new modelling framework proposed here, then enables us to
combine these components so that in the integrated model both mode switching as
well as the kinetics within modes are appropriately represented. A mathematical
analysis reveals that the behaviour of the hierarchical Markov model naturally
depends on the properties of its components. We also demonstrate how a
hierarchical Markov model can be parameterised using experimental data and show
that it provides a better representation than a previous model of the same data
set. Because evidence is increasing that modal gating reflects underlying
molecular properties of the channel protein, it is likely that biophysical
processes are better captured by our new approach than in earlier models.

two small single-domain proteins at the ribosomal exit tunnel by using Langevin
dynamics with coarse-grained models. It is shown that at temperatures lower or
near the temperature of the fastest folding, folding proceeds concomitantly
with the escape process, resulting in vectorial folding and enhancement of
foldability of nascent proteins. The concomitance between the two processes,
however, deteriorates as temperature increases. Our folding simulations as well
as free energy calculation by using umbrella sampling show that, at low
temperatures, folding at the tunnel follows one or two specific pathways
without kinetic traps. It is shown that the escape time can be mapped to a
one-dimensional diffusion model with two different regimes for temperatures
above and below the folding transition temperature. Attractive interactions
between amino acids and attractive sites on the tunnel wall lead to a free
energy barrier along the escape route of protein. It is suggested that this
barrier slows down the escape process and consequently promotes correct folding
of the released nascent protein.

influence how easily distress can spread within the system. However, in
financial network models, the details of how financial institutions interact
typically play a decisive role, and a general understanding of precisely how
network topology creates instability remains lacking. Here we show how
processes that are widely believed to stabilise the financial system, i.e.
market integration and diversification, can actually drive it towards
instability, as they contribute to create cyclical structures which tend to
amplify financial distress, thereby undermining systemic stability and making
large crises more likely. This result holds irrespective of the details of how
institutions interact, showing that policy-relevant analysis of the factors
affecting financial stability can be carried out while abstracting away from
such details.

called photonic crystals (PCs), has begun with the pioneer works of
Yablonovitch and John as one can efficiently control the propagation of the
electromagnetic (EM) waves in the same manner with semiconductors that affect
the electron conduction. One of the main peculiar properties of PCs is that
they have photonic band gap in the transmission spectrum similar to electronic
band gap and hence, they are able to prevent the light to propagate in certain
frequency regions irrespective of the propagation direction in space. Inside
the band gaps, neither optical modes nor spontaneous emissions exist. Breaking
the rotational and mirror symmetries of PC unit cells provides rich dispersive
features such as tilted self-collimation, and wavelength de-multiplexing
effects. Another important issue in PC designs is that it is feasible to design
graded index medium if the parameters of the two dimensional PCs is
intentionally rearranged. That type of configuration is known as Graded index
photonic crystals (GRIN PCs). The implementations of GRIN via periodic
structures provide great flexibilities in terms of designing different index
gradient and photonic integrated circuit components such as couplers, lenses,
and mode order converters. It is crucial to deliver optical signal without any
loss for the long distances where light diffraction plays an important role.
Hence, dealing with the alternative solution to light diffraction phenomena
using 2D axicon shape annular type photonic structure is another topic of this
thesis. In addition to conventional photonic all dielectric structures, we have
proposed gain-loss modulated parity-time (PT-) symmetric photonic structures to
obtain strong asymmetric light transmission close to the crystallographic
resonances or, equivalently, close to high-symmetry points.

provide any clear parameter to classify plants species. Complex network theory
can then be used in order to determine which feature amongst many can be used

day$^{-1}$ ($3.7 \pm 0.4 \times 10^{24}$ Mx day$^{-1}$ over the entire solar
surface). Flux disappears from the internetwork at a rate of $125 \pm 6$ Mx
cm$^{-2}$ day$^{-1}$ ($3.9\pm 0.5 \times 10^{24}$ Mx day$^{-1}$) through fading
of magnetic elements, cancellation between opposite-polarity features, and
interactions with network patches, which converts internetwork elements into
network features. Most of the flux is lost through fading and interactions with
the network, at nearly the same rate of about 50 Mx cm$^{-2}$ day$^{-1}$. Our
results demonstrate that the sources and sinks of internetwork magnetic flux
are well balanced. Using the instantaneous flux appearance and disappearance
rates, we successfully reproduce the time evolution of the total unsigned flux

integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect in the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
It makes use of the Linear Covariance-Based filter introduced by Barreiro et
al., and combines CMB data with any number of large-scale structure (LSS)
surveys and lensing information. It also exploits CMB polarization to reduce
cosmic variance. The performance of the method has been thoroughly tested with
simulations taking into account the impact of non-ideal conditions such as
incomplete sky coverage or the presence of noise. In particular, three galaxy
surveys are simulated, whose redshift distributions peak at low ($z \simeq
0.3$), intermediate ($z \simeq 0.6$) and high redshift ($z \simeq 0.9$). The
contribution of each of the considered data sets as well as the effect of a
mask and noise in the reconstructed ISW map is studied in detail. When
combining all the considered data sets (CMB temperature and polarization, the
three galaxy surveys and the lensing map), the proposed filter successfully
reconstructs a map of the weak ISW signal, finding a perfect correlation with
the input signal for the ideal case and around 80 per cent, on average, in the
presence of noise and incomplete sky coverage. We find that including CMB
polarization improves the correlation between input and reconstruction although
only at a small level. Nonetheless, given the weakness of the ISW signal, even
modest improvements can be of importance. In particular, in realistic
situations, in which less information is available from the LSS tracers, the
effect of including polarisation is larger. For instance, for the case in which
the ISW signal is recovered from CMB plus only one survey, and taking into
account the presence of noise and incomplete sky coverage, the improvement in
the correlation coefficient can be as large as 10 per cent.

intervention studies, the potential to use surrogate markers to decrease the
required follow-up time is a very attractive goal. However, previous studies
have shown that using inadequate markers or making inappropriate assumptions
about the relationship between the primary outcome and surrogate marker can
lead to inaccurate conclusions regarding the treatment effect. Currently
available methods for identifying and validating surrogate markers tend to rely
on restrictive model assumptions and/or focus on uncensored outcomes. The
ability to use such methods in practice when the primary outcome of interest is
a time-to-event outcome is difficult due to censoring and missing surrogate
information among those who experience the primary outcome before surrogate
marker measurement. In this paper, we propose a novel definition of the
proportion of treatment effect explained by surrogate information collected up
to a specified time in the setting of a time-to-event primary outcome. Our
proposed approach accommodates a setting where individuals may experience the
primary outcome before the surrogate marker is measured. We propose a robust
nonparametric procedure to estimate the defined quantity using censored data
and use a perturbation-resampling procedure for variance estimation. Simulation
studies demonstrate that the proposed procedures perform well in finite
samples. We illustrate the proposed procedures by investigating two potential
surrogate markers for diabetes using data from the Diabetes Prevention Program.

performed a radio continuum polarimetry study of IC10, the nearest starbursting
dwarf galaxy, using a combination of multifrequency interferometric (VLA) and
single-dish (Effelsberg) observations. VLA observations at 1.43 GHz reveal an
extensive and almost spherical radio halo of IC10 in total intensity, extending
twice more than the infrared-emitting galactic disk. The halo is magnetized
with a magnetic field strength of 7 microG in the outermost parts. Locally, the
magnetic field reaches about 29 microG in HII complexes, becomes more ordered,
and weakens to 22 microG in the synchrotron superbubble and to 7-10 microG
within HI holes. At the higher frequency of 4.86 GHz, we found a large-scale
magnetic field structure of X-shaped morphology, similar to that observed in
several edge-on spiral galaxies. The X-shaped magnetic structure can be caused
by the galactic wind, advecting magnetic fields injected into the interstellar
medium by stellar winds and supernova explosions. The radio continuum scale
heights at 1.43 GHz indicate the bulk speed of cosmic-ray electrons outflowing
from HII complexes of about 60 km/s, exceeding the escape velocity of 40 km/s.
Hence, the magnetized galactic wind in IC10 inflates the extensive radio halo
visible at 1.43 GHz and can seed the IGM with both random and ordered magnetic
fields. These are signatures of intense material feedback onto the IGM,
expected to be prevalent in the protogalaxies of the early Universe.

unusually low metallicity of the gas. Centroid velocity maps show mostly
blueshifts to the south and redshifts to the north of the nucleus, but the
velocity field is not well fitted by a rotation model. Velocity dispersions are
low (< 100 km s$^{-1}$) along the ELF, ruling out a jet-cloud interaction as
the origin of this structure. The ELF shows both blueshifts and redshifts in
channel maps, suggesting that it is close to the plane of the sky. The ELF is
evidently photoionized by the AGN, but its kinematics and inferred low
metallicity suggest that this structure may have originated in a past merger
event with another galaxy. We suggest that the gas acquired in this interaction

consider two natural parameters of the problem, for which we establish a sharp

we present a randomized approximation algorithm (RGMA) for GreedyMatching on a
special class of weighted graphs, called bush graphs. We highlight an
unexpected connection between RGMA and the approximation of maximum cardinality

long-time average cost control, where the control effort is assumed to be
expensive. The approach is based on sum-of-squares and semi-definite
programming techniques. It is applicable to dynamical systems whose right-hand
side is a polynomial function in the state variables and the controls. The key
idea, first described but not implemented in (Chernyshenko et al., Phil. Trans.
R. Soc. A, 372, 2014), is that the difficult problem of optimizing a cost
function involving long-time averages is replaced by an optimization of the
upper bound of the same average. As such, controller design requires the
simultaneous optimization of both the control law and a tunable function,
similar to a Lyapunov function. The present paper introduces a method resolving
the well-known inherent non-convexity of this kind of optimization. The method
is based on the formal assumption that the control is expensive, from which it
follows that the optimal control is small. The resulting asymptotic
optimization problems are convex. The derivation of all the polynomial
coefficients in the controller is given in terms of the solvability conditions
of state-dependent linear and bilinear inequalities. The proposed approach is
applied to the problem of designing a full-information feedback controller that
mitigates vortex shedding in the wake of a circular cylinder in the laminar
regime via rotary oscillations. Control results on a reduced-order model of the

  with Submodular Bidders",,,,,"cs.GT cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study a central problem in Algorithmic Mechanism Design: constructing
truthful mechanisms for welfare maximization in combinatorial auctions with
submodular bidders. Dobzinski, Nisan, and Schapira provided the first mechanism
that guarantees a non-trivial approximation ratio of $O(\log^2 m)$ [STOC'06],
where $m$ is the number of items. This was subsequently improved to $O(\log
m\log \log m)$ [Dobzinski, APPROX'07] and then to $O(\log m)$ [Krysta and
Vocking, ICALP'12].
  In this paper we develop the first mechanism that breaks the logarithmic
barrier. Specifically, the mechanism provides an approximation ratio of
$O(\sqrt {\log m})$. Similarly to previous constructions, our mechanism uses
polynomially many value and demand queries, and in fact provides the same
approximation ratio for the larger class of XOS (a.k.a. fractionally
subadditive) valuations.
  We also develop a computationally efficient implementation of the mechanism
for combinatorial auctions with budget additive bidders. Although in general
computing a demand query is NP-hard for budget additive valuations, we observe
that the specific form of demand queries that our mechanism uses can be
efficiently computed when bidders are budget additive.

the physical properties (e.g., SFR, stellar masses) of all the galaxies in the
VIPERS spectroscopic survey. The large volume explored by VIPERS will enable a
unique investigation of the relationship between the galaxy properties and
their environment (density field and cosmic web) at high redshift (0.5 < z <

build-up of the multi-color catalogues. The CFHTLS-T0007 (gri-{\chi}^2) images
are used as reference to detect and measure the $K_s$-band photometry, while
the T0007 u-selected sources are used as priors to perform the GALEX photometry

function of radius down to 0.15 M$_\odot$ in the outer parts of the cluster. We
identify for the first time a flattening in the mass function (in logarithmic
units) at a mass range that is consistent with that of the field and nearby
embedded clusters. Through log-normal functional fits to the mass functions we
find the nominal peak mass to be comparable to that of the field and nearby
embedded star clusters. The width of a log-normal fit appears slightly narrow
compared to the width of the field IMF, closer to the values found for globular
clusters. The subsolar content within the cluster does not appear to be mass
segregated in contrast to the findings for the supersolar content. The total
mass of Westerlund 1 is estimated to be 44-57 $\times 10^3$ M$_\odot$ where the
main uncertainty is the choice of the isochrone age and the higher mass slope.
Comparing the photometric mass with the dynamically determined mass, Westerlund
1 is sufficiently massive to remain bound and could potentially evolve into a
low-mass globular cluster.

use the gradient norm to evaluate the impact of a filter on error, and
re-initialize filters when the gradient norm of its weights falls below a

increases the number of filters explored without increasing the size of the

second order in cosmological perturbation theory assuming a Gaussian primordial
curvature perturbation. For the first time we perform a full numerical
integration of the bispectrum for both baryons and cold dark matter using the
second-order Einstein-Boltzmann code, SONG. We review previous analytical
results and provide an improved analytic approximation for the second-order
kernel in Poisson gauge which incorporates Newtonian nonlinear evolution,
relativistic initial conditions, the effect of radiation at early times and the
cosmological constant at late times. Our improved kernel provides a percent
level fit to the full numerical result at late times for most configurations,
including both equilateral shapes and the squeezed limit. We show that baryon
acoustic oscillations leave an imprint in the matter bispectrum, making a
significant impact on squeezed shapes.

entanglement entropy for small subsystems after a global quench, in the context
of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Opposite to the large interval limit, in this
case the evolution of the system takes place at timescales that are shorter in
comparison to the local equilibration scale and thus, different physical
mechanisms govern the dynamics and subsequent thermalization. In particular, we
show that the heuristic picture in terms of a ""entanglement tsunami"" does not
apply in this regime. We find two crucial differences. First, that the
instantaneous rate of growth of the entanglement is not constrained by
causality, but rather its time average. And second, that the approach to
saturation is always continuous, regardless the shape of the entangling
surface. Our analytic expansion also enables us to verify some previous
numerical results, namely, that the saturation time is non-monotonic with
respect to the chemical potential. All of our results are pertinent to CFTs
with a classical gravity dual formulation.

imparted by the meter laser, due to radiation pressure quantum fluctuations,
gives rise to correlations between its phase and amplitude quadratures. These
quantum correlations are observed in the experiment both as squeezing of the
meter field fluctuations below the vacuum level in a homodyne measurement, and
as sideband asymmetry in a heterodyne measurement, demonstrating the common
origin of both phenomena. We show that quantum feedback, i.e. feedback that
suppresses measurement back-action, can be used to increase the visibility of
the sideband asymmetry ratio. In contrast, by operating the feedback loop in
the regime of noise squashing, where the in-loop photocurrent variance is
reduced below the vacuum level, the visibility of the sideband asymmetry is
reduced. This is due to feedback back-action arising from vacuum noise in the
homodyne detector. These experiments demonstrate the possibility, as well as
the fundamental limits of measurement-based feedback as a tool to manipulate
quantum correlations.

finite on-site symmetry are classified by non-degenerate unitary braided fusion
categories over a symmetric fusion category (SFC) $\cal E$, abbreviated as
$\text{UMTC}_{/\cal E}$, together with their modular extensions and total
chiral central charges. The SFC $\cal E$ is $\text{Rep}(G)$ for bosonic
symmetry $G$, or $\text{sRep}(G^f)$ for fermionic symmetry $G^f$. As a special
case of the above result, we find that the modular extensions of
$\text{Rep}(G)$ classify the 2+1D bosonic SPT states of symmetry $G$, while the
$c=0$ modular extensions of $\text{sRep}(G^f)$ classify the 2+1D fermionic SPT
states of symmetry $G^f$. Many fermionic SPT states are studied based on the
constructions from free-fermion models. But it is not clear if free-fermion
constructions can produce all fermionic SPT states. Our classification does not
have such a drawback. We show that, for interacting 2+1D fermionic systems,
there are exactly 16 superconducting phases with no symmetry and no fractional
excitations (up to $E_8$ bosonic quantum Hall states). Also, there are exactly
8 $Z_2\times Z_2^f$-SPT phases, 2 $Z_8^f$-SPT phases, and so on. Besides, we
show that two topological orders with identical bulk excitations and central

a lot of interest in precisely setting its limits with on going and future
experiments. A question to answer is about the validity of the Strong
Equivalence Principle. Ground experiments and Lunar Laser Ranging have provided
the best upper limit on the Nordtvedt parameter $\sigma[\eta]=4.4\times
10^{-4}$. With the future planetary mission BepiColombo, this parameter will be
further improved by at least an order of magnitude. In this paper we envisage
yet another possible testing environment with spacecraft ranging towards the
nearby Sun-Earth collinear Lagrangian points. Neglecting errors in planetary
masses and ephemerides, we forecast $\sigma[\eta]=6.4\,(2.0)\times10^{-4}$ (5
yr integration time) via ranging towards $L_1$ in a realistic (optimistic)
scenario depending on current (future) range capabilities and knowledge of the
Earth's ephemerides. A combined measurement, $L_1$+$L_2$, gives instead
$4.8\,(1.7)\times10^{-4}$. In the optimistic scenario a single measurement of
one year would be enough to reach $\approx3\times10^{-4}$. All figures are
comparable with Lunar Laser Ranging, but worse than BepiColombo. Performances
could be much improved if data were integrated over time and over the number of
satellites flying around either of the two Lagrangian points. We point out that
some systematics (gravitational perturbations of other planets or figure
effects) are much more in control compared to other experiments. We do not
advocate a specific mission to constrain the Strong Equivalence Principle, but
we do suggest analysing ranging data of present and future spacecrafts flying
around $L_1$/$L_2$ (one key mission is, for instance, LISA Pathfinder). This
spacecraft ranging would be a new and complementary probe to constrain the
Strong Equivalence Principle in space.

avenue to study the foundations of physics and to develop a suite of
quantum-enhanced technologies. One prominent path of study is provided by
quantum optomechanics which utilizes the tools of quantum optics to control the
motion of macroscopic mechanical resonators. Despite excellent recent progress,
the preparation of mechanical quantum superposition states remains outstanding
due to weak coupling and thermal decoherence. Here we present a novel
optomechanical scheme that significantly relaxes these requirements allowing
the preparation of quantum superposition states of motion of a mechanical
resonator by exploiting the nonlinearity of multi-photon quantum measurements.
Our method is capable of generating non-classical mechanical states without the
need for strong single photon coupling, is resilient against optical loss, and
offers more favourable scaling against initial mechanical thermal occupation
than existing schemes. Moreover, our approach allows the generation of larger
superposition states by projecting the optical field onto NOON states. We
experimentally demonstrate this multi-photon-counting technique on a mechanical
thermal state in the classical limit and observe interference fringes in the
mechanical position distribution that show phase superresolution. This opens a
feasible route to explore and exploit quantum phenomena at a macroscopic scale.

the need for hydrodynamic simulations. The model is based on physically
motivated scaling laws and simple differential equations describing the shock
propagation, the contraction of the neutron star, the neutrino emission, the
heating conditions, and the explosion energetics. Using model parameters
compatible with multi-D simulations and a fine grid of thousands of supernova
progenitors, we obtain a variegated landscape of neutron star and black hole
formation similar to other parameterised approaches and find good agreement
with semi-empirical measures for the ""explodability"" of massive stars. Our
predicted explosion properties largely conform to observed correlations between
the nickel mass and explosion energy. Accounting for the coexistence of
outflows and downflows during the explosion phase, we naturally obtain a
positive correlation between explosion energy and ejecta mass. These
correlations are relatively robust against parameter variations, but our
results suggest that there is considerable leeway in parametric models to widen
or narrow the mass ranges for black hole and neutron star formation and to
scale explosion energies up or down. Our model is currently limited to an
all-or-nothing treatment of fallback and there remain some minor discrepancies
between model predictions and observational constraints.

is critical. We present first results from the Latte Project: the Milky Way on
FIRE (Feedback in Realistic Environments). This simulation models the formation

gas kernel/softening that adapts down to 1 pc (with a median of 25 - 60 pc at z

accurate hydrodynamics and the FIRE-2 model for star formation and explicit
feedback within a multi-phase interstellar medium. For the first time, Latte
self-consistently resolves the spatial scales corresponding to half-light radii
of dwarf galaxies that form around a MW-mass host down to Mstar > 10^5 Msun.
Latte's population of dwarf galaxies agrees with the LG across a broad range of
properties: (1) distributions of stellar masses and stellar velocity
dispersions (dynamical masses), including their joint relation; (2) the
mass-metallicity relation; and (3) a diverse range of star-formation histories,
including their mass dependence. Thus, Latte produces a realistic population of
dwarf galaxies at Mstar > 10^5 Msun that does not suffer from the ""missing

We conclude that baryonic physics can reconcile observed dwarf galaxies with
standard LCDM cosmology.

piecewise constant representation (effectively a histogram) of the distribution
of galaxy types and redshifts, the parameters of which are efficiently inferred
from noisy photometric flux measurements. This approach can be seen as a
generalization of template-fitting photometric redshift methods and relies on a
library of spectral templates to relate the photometric fluxes of individual
galaxies to their redshifts. We illustrate this technique on simulated galaxy
survey data, and demonstrate that it delivers correct posterior distributions
on the underlying type and redshift distributions, as well as on the individual
types and redshifts of galaxies. We show that even with uninformative priors,
large photometric errors and parameter degeneracies, the redshift and type
distributions can be recovered robustly thanks to the hierarchical nature of
the model, which is not possible with common photometric redshift estimation

simultaneously reproducing MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) phenomenology on
galactic scales. The agents responsible for mediating the MONDian force law are
superfluid phonons that couple to ordinary (baryonic) matter. In this paper we
propose an alternative way for the MOND phenomenon to emerge from DM
superfluidity. The central idea is to use higher-gradient corrections in the
superfluid effective theory. These next-to-leading order terms involve
gradients of the gravitational potential, and therefore effectively modify the
gravitational force law. In the process we discover a novel mechanism for
generating the non-relativistic MOND action, starting from a theory that is
fully analytic in all field variables. The idea, inspired by the symmetron
mechanism, uses the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry. For large
acceleration, the symmetry is unbroken and the action reduces to Einstein
gravity. For small acceleration, the symmetry is spontaneously broken and the
action reduces to MONDian gravity. Cosmologically, however, the universe is
always in the Einstein-gravity, symmetry-restoring phase. The expansion history
and linear growth of density perturbations are therefore indistinguishable from
LambdaCDM cosmology.

filaments of cold molecular gas in the central galaxy of the cluster
PKS0745-191. The total molecular gas mass of 4.6 +/- 0.3 x 10^9 solar masses,
assuming a Galactic X_{CO} factor, is divided roughly equally between three
filaments each extending radially 3-5 kpc from the galaxy centre. The emission
peak is located in the SE filament roughly 1 arcsec (2 kpc) from the nucleus.
The velocities of the molecular clouds in the filaments are low, lying within
+/-100 km/s of the galaxy's systemic velocity. Their FWHMs are less than 150
km/s, which is significantly below the stellar velocity dispersion. Although
the molecular mass of each filament is comparable to a rich spiral galaxy, such
low velocities show that the filaments are transient and the clouds would
disperse on <10^7 yr timescales unless supported, likely by the indirect effect
of magnetic fields. The velocity structure is inconsistent with a merger origin
or gravitational free-fall of cooling gas in this massive central galaxy. If
the molecular clouds originated in gas cooling even a few kpc from their
current locations their velocities would exceed those observed. Instead, the
projection of the N and SE filaments underneath X-ray cavities suggests they
formed in the updraft behind bubbles buoyantly rising through the cluster
atmosphere. Direct uplift of the dense gas by the radio bubbles appears to
require an implausibly high coupling efficiency. The filaments are coincident
with low temperature X-ray gas, bright optical line emission and dust lanes
indicating that the molecular gas could have formed from lifted warmer gas that
cooled in situ.

known to the Minor Planet Center and can be identified because they move across
a resolution element in a matter of hours, orders of magnitude faster than
Planet Nine. If Planet Nine is smaller, colder, and/or more distant than

therefore, an upper bound on the dark matter total annihilation cross section.
In addition, we point out that gamma-ray telescopes, unlike neutrino detectors,

increased star formation rate (SFR). In this Letter, we confirm and quantify
the presence of an IR excess in a significant fraction of galaxies in the
3D-HST GOODS catalogs. By constructing a matched sample of galaxies with and
without strong non-stellar near-IR emission, we find that galaxies with such
emission are predominantly star-forming galaxies. Moreover, star-forming
galaxies with an excess show increased mid- and far-IR and H$\alpha$ emission
compared to other star-forming galaxies without. While galaxies with a near-IR
excess show a larger fraction of individually detected X-ray active galactic
nuclei (AGNs), an X-ray stacking analysis, together with the IR-colors and
H$\alpha$ profiles, shows that AGNs are unlikely to be the dominant source of
the excess in the majority of galaxies. Our results suggest that non-stellar
near-IR emission is linked to increased SFRs and is ubiquitous among
star-forming galaxies. As such, the near-IR emission might be a powerful tool
to measure SFRs in the era of the James Webb Space Telescope.

reconnection. The proximity of these high-field regions to the event horizon
forms a natural connection between IR and X-ray variability and accounts for
the rapid timescales associated with the X-ray flares. The qualitative nature
of this variability is consistent with observations, producing X-ray flares
that are always coincident with IR flares, but not vice versa, i.e., there are
a number of IR flares without X-ray counterparts.

Europe and the Middle East. Therefore, a hierarchical model is presented that
accounts for regional differences. For this purpose, the scaling of
ground-motion intensity measures is assumed to be similar, but not identical in
different regions. This is achieved by assuming a hierarchical model, where
some coefficients are treated as random variables which are sampled from an
underlying global distribution. The coefficients are estimated by Bayesian
inference. This allows one to estimate the epistemic uncertainty in the
coefficients, and consequently in model predictions, in a rigorous way. The
model is estimated based on peak ground acceleration data from nine different
European/Middle Eastern regions. There are large differences in the amount of
earthquakes and records in the different regions. However, due to the
hierarchical nature of the model, regions with only few data points borrow
strength from other regions with more data. This makes it possible to estimate
a separate set of coefficients for all regions. Different regionalized models
are compared, for which different coefficients are assumed to be regionally
dependent. Results show that regionalizing the coefficients for magnitude and
distance scaling leads to better performance of the models. The models for all
regions are physically sound, even if only very few earthquakes comprise one
region.

cryptography. This motivated the cryptographic community to search for
quantum-safe solutions. On the other hand, the impact of quantum computing on
secret key cryptography is much less understood. In this paper, we consider
attacks where an adversary can query an oracle implementing a cryptographic
primitive in a quantum superposition of different states. This model gives a
lot of power to the adversary, but recent results show that it is nonetheless
possible to build secure cryptosystems in it.
  We study applications of a quantum procedure called Simon's algorithm (the
simplest quantum period finding algorithm) in order to attack symmetric
cryptosystems in this model. Following previous works in this direction, we
show that several classical attacks based on finding collisions can be
dramatically sped up using Simon's algorithm: finding a collision requires
$\Omega(2^{n/2})$ queries in the classical setting, but when collisions happen
with some hidden periodicity, they can be found with only $O(n)$ queries in the
quantum model.
  We obtain attacks with very strong implications. First, we show that the most
widely used modes of operation for authentication and authenticated encryption
e.g. CBC-MAC, PMAC, GMAC, GCM, and OCB) are completely broken in this security
model. Our attacks are also applicable to many CAESAR candidates: CLOC, AEZ,
COPA, OTR, POET, OMD, and Minalpher. This is quite surprising compared to the
situation with encryption modes: Anand et al. show that standard modes are
secure with a quantum-secure PRF.
  Second, we show that Simon's algorithm can also be applied to slide attacks,
leading to an exponential speed-up of a classical symmetric cryptanalysis
technique in the quantum model.

show that the $E_8$ root system can in fact be constructed from the icosahedron

each 3D root system induces a root system in 4D, which turn out to also be
exactly the exceptional 4D root systems. The spinorial point of view explains
their existence as well as their unusual automorphism groups. This spinorial
approach thus in fact allows one to construct all exceptional root systems

with a higher turnover frequency, for a period of several years before
reverting back to the initial shape during the latest measurements. The

offer another realization of pseudo-relativistic three-dimensional particles in
a condensed matter system. These single valley relativistic states, referred to
as massless Kane fermions, cannot be described by any other well-known
relativistic massless particles. Furthermore, the HgCdTe band structure can be
continuously tailored by modifying either the cadmium content or temperature.
At the critical concentration or temperature, the bandgap, Eg, collapses as the
system undergoes a semimetal-to-semiconductor topological phase transition
between the inverted and normal alignments. Here, using far-infrared
magneto-spectroscopy we explore the continuous evolution of band structure of
bulk HgCdTe as temperature is tuned across the topological phase transition. We
demonstrate that the rest-mass of the Dirac-like Kane fermions, m changes sign
at the critical temperature, while their velocity, c remains constant. The
relation Eg = 2mc2 with the universal value of c = (1.07 +- 0.05)10x6 m/s

framework for root systems and reflection groups, as well as related groups
such as the conformal and modular groups: The metric that exists on these
spaces can always be used to construct the corresponding Clifford algebra. Via
the Cartan-Dieudonn\'e theorem all the transformations of interest can be
written as products of reflections and thus via `sandwiching' with Clifford
algebra multivectors. These multivector groups can be used to perform concrete
calculations in different groups, e.g. the various types of polyhedral groups,
and we treat the example of the tetrahedral group $A_3$ in detail. As an aside,
this gives a constructive result that induces from every 3D root system a root
system in dimension four, which hinges on the facts that the group of spinors
provides a double cover of the rotations, the space of 3D spinors has a 4D
euclidean inner product, and with respect to this inner product the group of
spinors can be shown to be closed under reflections. In particular the 4D root
systems/Coxeter groups induced in this way are precisely the exceptional ones,
with the 3D spinorial point of view also explaining their unusual automorphism
groups. This construction simplifies Arnold's trinities and puts the McKay
correspondence into a wider framework. We finally discuss extending the
conformal geometric algebra approach to the 2D conformal and modular groups,
which could have interesting novel applications in conformal field theory,
string theory and modular form theory.

  Communication using Hierarchical Rings with Deflection Routing",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hierarchical ring networks, which hierarchically connect multiple levels of
rings, have been proposed in the past to improve the scalability of ring
interconnects, but past hierarchical ring designs sacrifice some of the key
benefits of rings by introducing more complex in-ring buffering and buffered
flow control. Our goal in this paper is to design a new hierarchical ring
interconnect that can maintain most of the simplicity of traditional ring
designs (no in-ring buffering or buffered flow control) while achieving high
scalability as more complex buffered hierarchical ring designs. Our design,
called HiRD (Hierarchical Rings with Deflection), includes features that allow
us to mostly maintain the simplicity of traditional simple ring topologies
while providing higher energy efficiency and scalability. First, HiRD does not
have any buffering or buffered flow control within individual rings, and
requires only a small amount of buffering between the ring hierarchy levels.
When inter-ring buffers are full, our design simply deflects flits so that they
circle the ring and try again, which eliminates the need for in-ring buffering.
Second, we introduce two simple mechanisms that provides an end-to-end delivery
guarantee within the entire network without impacting the critical path or
latency of the vast majority of network traffic. HiRD attains equal or better
performance at better energy efficiency than multiple versions of both a
previous hierarchical ring design and a traditional single ring design. We also
analyze our design's characteristics and injection and delivery guarantees. We
conclude that HiRD can be a compelling design point that allows higher energy
efficiency and scalability while retaining the simplicity and appeal of
conventional ring-based designs.

Standard deviations are used to analyze the dispersion of period spacing.
Studying the dispersion of period spacing on a DAV star KUV03442+0719
preliminarily, we suggest that log($M_{\rm H}/M_{*}$) is from -8.5 to -5.5. In
addition, modes partly trapped in C/O core are found based on those DAV star
models. The identified modes and average period spacings indicate that
KUV03442+0719 may be the first star to 'observe' modes partly trapped in C/O
core.

interrogating the spatial and temporal information of electrons and ions in a
dynamic system. After ionization, part of the electron wave packet may directly
go to the detector (the reference wave), while another part may be driven back
to the ion where it scatters off (the signal wave). The interference hologram
of the two waves may be used to retrieve the target information. However,
unlike conventional optical holography, the propagations of electron wave
packets are affected by the Coulomb potential as well as by the laser field. In
addition, electrons are emitted over the whole laser pulse duration, thus
multiple interferences may occur. In this work, we used a generalized
quantum-trajectory Monte Carlo method to investigate the effect of Coulomb
potential and the nonadiabatic subcycle ionization on the photoelectron
hologram. We showed that photoelectron hologram can be well described only when
the nonadiabatic effect in ionization is accounted for, and Coulomb potential
can be neglected only in the tunnel ionization regime. Our results help

to the mode conversion of transverse electromagnetic waves into longitudinal

left-circularly-polarized waves are the eigenmodes of propagation with
different effective refractive indices $n_+$ and $n_-$, whereas in the chiral

grows due to the gauge kinetic function. When the energy density of magnetic
fields catches up with that of electric fields, chromo-natural inflation takes
over in the late stage of inflation, which we call delayed chromo-natural
inflation. Thus, the delayed chromo-natural inflation driven by the axion and
the gauge field is induced by the dilaton. The interesting outcome of the model
is generation of chiral primordial gravitational waves on small scales. Since
the gauge field is inert in the early stage of inflation, it is viable in
contrast to the conventinal chromo-natural inflation. We find the parameter
region where chiral gravitational waves are generated in a frequency range
higher than nHz, which are potentially detectable in future gravitational wave

Spectral methods have been applied to learn unsupervised topic models, such as
latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), with provable guarantees. This paper
investigates the possibility of applying spectral methods to recover the

but decidable first-order system, named MAV1, featuring a de Morgan dual pair
of nominal quantifiers. These nominal quantifiers called `new' and `wen' are
distinct from the self-dual Gabbay-Pitts and Miller-Tiu nominal quantifiers.
The novelty of these nominal quantifiers is they are polarised in the sense
that `new' distributes over positive operators while `wen' distributes over
negative operators. This greater control of bookkeeping enables private names
to be modelled in processes embedded as formulae in MAV1. The technical
challenge is to establish a cut elimination result, from which essential
properties including the transitivity of implication follow. Since the system
is defined using the calculus of structures, a generalisation of the sequent
calculus, novel techniques are employed. The proof relies on an intricately
designed multiset-based measure of the size of a proof, which is used to guide
a normalisation technique called splitting. The presence of equivariance, which
swaps successive quantifiers, induces complex inter-dependencies between
nominal quantifiers, additive conjunction and multiplicative operators in the
proof of splitting. Every rule is justified by an example demonstrating why the
rule is necessary for soundly embedding processes and ensuring that cut
elimination holds.

tweak scheduling parameters, we cannot modify algorithmic logic, or add a
completely new algorithm, after the switch has been designed. This paper
presents a design for a programmable packet scheduler, which allows scheduling
algorithms---potentially algorithms that are unknown today---to be programmed
into a switch without requiring hardware redesign.
  Our design builds on the observation that scheduling algorithms make two
decisions: in what order to schedule packets and when to schedule them.
Further, in many scheduling algorithms these decisions can be made when packets
are enqueued. We leverage this observation to build a programmable scheduler
using a single abstraction: the push-in first-out queue (PIFO), a priority
queue that maintains the scheduling order and time for such algorithms.
  We show that a programmable scheduler using PIFOs lets us program a wide
variety of scheduling algorithms. We present a detailed hardware design for
this scheduler for a 64-port 10 Gbit/s shared-memory switch with <4% chip area
overhead on a 16-nm standard-cell library. Our design lets us program many
sophisticated algorithms, such as a 5-level hierarchical scheduler with

it can be interpreted as defining a fine-grained uncertainty relation. It is
natural to ask whether the same property holds for other points on the quantum

Hund coupling, and the spin-singlet superconducting state in the case of
negative Hund coupling. It is demonstrated that for certain crystal field
splittings the higher energy orbitals instead of the lower ones are relevant
for superconductivity, and that $T_c$ can be enhanced by the crystal field
effect. We comment on the implications of our results for the superconductivity
in strontium ruthenates, and for the recently reported light-enhanced
superconducting state in alkali-doped fullerides.

disorder extends applicability of the equilibrium linear--response theory to
stronger drivings, whereas the response of the MBL systems is very distinctive,
revealing currents with damped oscillations. The oscillation frequency is
independent of driving and the damping is not due to heating but rather due to
dephasing. The details of damping depend on the system's history reflecting
nonergodicity of the MBL phase, while the frequency of the oscillations remains
a robust hallmark of localization. We show that the distinctive characteristic

increase in data traffic over cellular networks. Caching popular videos in the
storage of small-cell base stations (SBS), namely, small-cell caching, is an
efficient technology for reducing the transmission latency whilst mitigating
the redundant transmissions of popular videos over back-haul channels. In this
paper, we consider a commercialized small-cell caching system consisting of a
network service provider (NSP), several video retailers (VR), and mobile users
(MU). The NSP leases its SBSs to the VRs for the purpose of making profits, and
the VRs, after storing popular videos in the rented SBSs, can provide faster
local video transmissions to the MUs, thereby gaining more profits. We conceive
this system within the framework of Stackelberg game by treating the SBSs as a
specific type of resources. We first model the MUs and SBSs as two independent
Poisson point processes, and develop, via stochastic geometry theory, the
probability of the specific event that an MU obtains the video of its choice
directly from the memory of an SBS. Then, based on the probability derived, we
formulate a Stackelberg game to jointly maximize the average profit of both the
NSP and the VRs. Also, we investigate the Stackelberg equilibrium by solving a
non-convex optimization problem. With the aid of this game theoretic framework,
we shed light on the relationship between four important factors: the optimal
pricing of leasing an SBS, the SBSs allocation among the VRs, the storage size
of the SBSs, and the popularity distribution of the VRs. Monte-Carlo
simulations show that our stochastic geometry-based analytical results closely
match the empirical ones. Numerical results are also provided for quantifying
the proposed game-theoretic framework by showing its efficiency on pricing and
resource allocation.

that have left a clear imprint on the spatial distribution of GCs. The extended
central dominant structure is more prominent in the distribution of blue GCs,
while red GCs show density enhancements that are more centrally concentrated on
the host galaxies. We propose that the relatively small-scale density
structures in the red GCs are caused by galaxy-galaxy interactions, while the
extensive spatial distribution of blue GCs is due to stripping of GCs from the
halos of core massive galaxies by the Fornax gravitational potential. Our
investigations is based on density maps of candidate GCs extracted from the
multi-band VLT Survey Telescope (VST) survey of Fornax (FDS), identified in a
three-dimensional color space and further selected based on their $g$-band
magnitude and morphology.

channel of communication between its endpoints. The processors have to compute
a given function of all their inputs by communicating along these channels.
While this model has been widely used in distributed computing, strong lower
bounds on the amount of communication needed to compute simple functions have
just begun to appear. In this work, we prove a tight lower bound of
$\Omega(kn)$ on the communication needed for computing the Tribes function,
when the underlying graph is a star of $k+1$ nodes that has $k$ leaves with
inputs and a center with no input. Lower bound on this topology easily implies
comparable bounds for others. Our lower bounds are obtained by building upon
the recent information theoretic techniques of Braverman et.al (FOCS'13) and
combining it with the earlier work of Jayram, Kumar and Sivakumar (STOC'03).
This approach yields information complexity bounds that is of independent

known that the necessary and sufficient condition of distinguishability is that
the states are linearly independent. For infinite number of states, several
natural classes of distinguishability can be defined. We give a necessary and
sufficient condition for a system of pure states to be distinguishable. It
turns out that each level of distinguishability naturally corresponds to one of
the generalizations of linear independence to families of infinite vectors. As
an important example, we apply the general theory to von Neumann's lattice, a
subsystem of coherent states which corresponds to a lattice in the classical
phase space. We prove that the condition for distinguishability is that the
area of the fundamental region of the lattice is greater than the Planck
constant, and also find subtle behavior on the threshold. These facts reveal
the measurement theoretical meaning of the Planck constant and give a
justification for the interpretation that it is the smallest unit of area in

induced adhesion remained a puzzle until recently Guduru and coworkers have
shown a very convincing mechanism to explain both the increase of strength and
of toughness in a sphere with concentric single scale of waviness. Kesari and
coworkers have later shown some very elegant convenient asymptotic expansion of
Guduru's solution. This enhancement is very high and indeed, using Kesari's
solution, it is here shown to depend uniquely on a Johnson parameter for
adhesion of a sinusoidal contact. However, counterintuitively, it leads to
unbounded enhancement for conditions of large roughness for which Johnson
parameter is very low. Guduru postulated that this enhancement should occur
after sufficiently large pressure has been applied to any spherical contact.
Also, that although the enhancement is limited to the JKR regime of large soft
materials with high adhesion, the DMT limit for the smooth sphere is found
otherwise. However, for hard materials, even the DMT limit for the smooth
solids is very hard to observe, which suggest that also adhesion reduction is
yet not well understood.
  The limitations of the assumption of simply connected area is here further
discussed, and a well known model for hard particles in contact with rough
planes due to Rumpf is used to show that in the range where unbounded increase
is predicted, orders of magnitude reduction is instead expected for rigid
solids. We suggest that Guduru's model may be close to an upper bound to
adhesion of rough bodies, while the Rumpf-Rabinovich model may be close to a
lower bound.

characterized by millisecond durations and Jansky-level flux densities. We
carried out a statistical analysis on FRBs discovered. Their mean dispersion
measure, after subtracting the contribution from the interstellar medium of our
Galaxy, is found to be $\sim 660\,\rm pc\,cm^{-3}$, supporting their being from
cosmological origin. Their energy released in radio band spans about two orders
of magnitude, with a mean value of $\sim 10^{39}$ ergs. More interestingly,
although the FRB study is still in a very early phase, the published collection
of FRBs enables us to derive a useful intensity distribution function. For the
16 non-repeating FRBs detected by Parkes telescope and the Green Bank
Telescope, the intensity distribution can be described as $dN/dF_{\rm obs} =
(4.1 \pm 1.3) \times 10^3 \, F_{\rm obs}^{-1.1\pm0.2} \; \rm
sky^{-1}\,day^{-1}$, where $F_{\rm obs}$ is the observed radio fluence in units
of Jy~ms. Here the power-law index is significantly flatter than the expected
value of 2.5 for standard candles distributed homogeneously in a flat Euclidean
space. Based on this intensity distribution function, the Five-hundred-meter
Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) will be able to detect about 5 FRBs
for every 1000 hours of observation time.

by Englert, Scully, S\""ussmann and Walther [ESSW], and others, have formed a
rich area for investigating the puzzling behaviour of particles undergoing
quantum interference. The surprise provided by the original delayed choice
experiment, led Wheeler to the conclusion that ""no phenomenon is a phenomenon
until it is an observed phenomenon"", a radical explanation which implied that
""the past has no existence except as it is recorded in the present"". However
Bohm, Dewdney and Hiley have shown that the Bohm interpretation gives a
straightforward account of the behaviour of the particle without resorting to
such a radical explanation. The subsequent modifications of this experiment led
both Aharonov and Vaidman and [ESSW] to conclude that the resulting Bohm-type
trajectories in these new situations produce unacceptable properties. For
example, if a cavity is placed in one arm of the interferometer, it will be
excited by a particle travelling down the {\em other} arm. In other words it is
the particle that does {\em not} go through the cavity that gives up its
energy! If this analysis is correct, this behaviour would be truly bizarre and
could only be explained by an extreme non-local transfer of energy that is even
stronger than that required in an EPR-type processes. In this paper we show
that this conclusion is not correct and that if the Bohm interpretation is used
correctly, it gives a {\em local} explanation, which actually corresponds
exactly to the standard quantum mechanics explanation offered by Englert,
Scully, S\""ussmann and Walther [ESSW].

What is more seldom is
for disorder to reappear at lower temperature, which is known as reentrant
behavior. Such resurgence of disorder has been observed in a variety of
systems, ranging from Rochelle salts to nematic phases in liquid crystals.
Frustration is often a key ingredient for reentrance mechanisms. Here we shall
study a frustrated model, namely the anisotropic shuriken lattice, which offers
a natural setting to explore an extension of the notion of reentrance between
magnetic disordered phases. By tuning the anisotropy of the lattice, we open a
window in the phase diagram where magnetic disorder prevails down to zero
temperature. In this region, the competition between multiple disordered ground
states gives rise to a double crossover where both the low- and
high-temperature regimes are less correlated than the intervening classical
spin liquid. This reentrance of disorder is characterized by an entropy
plateau, a multi-step Curie law crossover and a rather complex diffuse
scattering in the static structure factor. Those results are confirmed by
complementary numerical and analytical methods: Monte Carlo simulations,
Husimi-tree calculations and an exact decoration-iteration transformation.

With this aim, we consider the dynamic problem of the incompressible flow of a

leads to obtain an one dimensional model via singular perturbation of the
Navier-Stokes system as $\varepsilon$, a non dimensional parameter related to
the radius of cross-section of the tube, tends to zero. We allow the radius
depend on tangential direction and time, so a coupling with an elastic or
viscoelastic law on the wall of the pipe is possible.
  To perform the asymptotic analysis, we do a change of variable to a reference
domain where we assume the existence of asymptotic expansions on $\varepsilon$
for both velocity and pressure which, upon substitution on Navier-Stokes
equations, leads to the characterization of various terms of the expansion.
This allows us to obtain an approximation of the solution of the Navier-Stokes

Chromodynamics (QCD) with two dynamical flavors of quarks is a long-standing

first or second order has important implications for the QCD phase diagram and
the existence of a critical endpoint at finite densities. We follow a recently
proposed approach to explicitly determine the region of first order chiral
transitions at imaginary chemical potential, where it is large enough to be
simulated, and extrapolate it to zero chemical potential with known critical
exponents. Using unimproved Wilson fermions on coarse $N_t=4$ lattices, the
first order region turns out to be so large that no extrapolation is necessary.
The critical pion mass $m_\pi^c\approx 560$ MeV is by nearly a factor 10 larger

under the action of external force is studied within the framework of
phenomenological approach. When considering the task it is taken into account
that double-stranded DNA is a polymorphic macromolecule with a set of
metastable states. Accordingly to proposed mechanism, DNA threshold elongation
can take place as a cooperative structural transition of macromolecule to
metastable form, which is stabilized by the external force. For the description
of DNA overstretching, the model included external (stretching) and internal
(conformation) displacement components is constructed. As assumed, both
components are coupled on the pathway of double helix transformations. It is
shown, that under force action DNA deformation proceeds in two stages. First
one is the restructuring of the double helix, which leads to formation of
conformational bistability in DNA macromolecule. On the second stage, the
conformational transition and the deformation induced by it consistently cover
the macromolecule as a threshold process. The comparison of calculated
characteristics of DNA overstretching process with experimental data shows good
agreement. Analysis of the results obtained, together with the available
literature data allow to conclude, that overstretching transition in the double
helix is dynamical process and can spread in DNA chain. In the same time, in
DNA with A$\cdot$T-rich content due to large dissipation the overstretching
process leads to force induced melting transition, and should have nearly
static character.

complying with the SIC requirements of the FD device, but also enjoys a very
low complexity that allows it to outperform state-of-the-art counterparts in

our transmit beamforming design achieves significant gains with respect to
applying zero-forcing to the SI channel when the number of transmit antennas is

different models from the QRPA genre, namely the pn-QRPA, the Pyatov method

heteroclinic (where there are dynamical connections between simple invariant
sets) or excitable (where a perturbation threshold needs to be crossed to a
dynamical connection between ""nodes""). Such network attractors can display a
high degree of sensitivity to noise both in terms of the regions of phase space
visited and in terms of the sequence of transitions around the network. The two
types of network are intimately related---one can directly bifurcate to the
other.
  In this paper we attempt to quantify the effect of additive noise on such
network attractors. Noise increases the average rate at which the networks are
explored, and can result in ""macroscopic"" random motion around the network. We
perform an asymptotic analysis of local behaviour of an escape model near
heteroclinic/excitable nodes in the limit of noise $\eta\rightarrow 0^+$ as a
model for the mean residence time $T$ near equilibria.
  We also explore transition probabilities between nodes of the network in the
presence of anisotropic noise. For low levels of noise, numerical results
suggest that a (heteroclinic or excitable) network can approximately realise
any set of transition probabilities and any sufficiently large mean residence
times at the given nodes. We show that this can be well modelled in our example
network by multiple independent escape processes, where the direction of first
escape determines the transition. This suggests that it is feasible to design
noisy network attractors with arbitrary Markov transition probabilities and
residence times.

proved by Cardaliaguet [4, 5] that the value of the games we consider is the

by fat-tailed measurement noise. To address this issue, we show how a recently

that simply reject measurements if they do not match the model. Secondly, the
computational cost of the standard Gaussian filter is prohibitive due to the
high-dimensional measurement, i.e. the depth image. To address this problem, we
propose an approximation to reduce the computational complexity of the filter.
In quantitative experiments on real data we show how our method clearly

performance to a particle-filter-based tracking method, and observe comparable

specifically when the distribution is defined by an evolving graph model, and
consider the time, space and randomness complexities of such samplers.
  In the standard approach, the whole graph is chosen randomly according to the
randomized evolving process, stored in full, and then queries on the sampled
graph are answered by simply accessing the stored graph. This may require
prohibitive amounts of time, space and random bits, especially when only a
small number of queries are actually issued. Instead, we propose to generate
the graph on-the-fly, in response to queries, and therefore to require amounts
of time, space, and random bits which are a function of the actual number of
queries.
  We focus on two random graph models: the Barab{\'{a}}si-Albert Preferential
Attachment model (BA-graphs) and the random recursive tree model. We give
on-the-fly generation algorithms for both models. With probability
$1-1/\mbox{poly}(n)$, each and every query is answered in $\mbox{polylog}(n)$
time, and the increase in space and the number of random bits consumed by any
single query are both $\mbox{polylog}(n)$, where $n$ denotes the number of
vertices in the graph.
  Our results show that, although the BA random graph model is defined by a
sequential process, efficient random access to the graph's nodes is possible.
In addition to the conceptual contribution, efficient on-the-fly generation of
random graphs can serve as a tool for the efficient simulation of sublinear
algorithms over large BA-graphs, and the efficient estimation of their
performance on such graphs.

scheduling packets on line networks with bounded buffers, where the aim is that
of maximizing the throughput. Each node in the network has a local buffer of
bounded size $B$, and each edge (or link) can transmit a limited number, $c$,
of packets in every time unit. The input to the problem consists of a set of
packet requests, each defined by a source node, a destination node, and a
release time. We denote by $n$ the size of the network. A solution for this
problem is a schedule that delivers (some of the) packets to their destinations
without violating the capacity constraints of the network (buffers or edges).
Our goal is to design an efficient algorithm that computes a schedule that
maximizes the number of packets that arrive to their respective destinations.

ratio for the case where $B=\Theta(c)$. This improves over the previously best
result of $O(\log^* n)$ (R\""acke and Ros\'en, Theory Comput. Syst., 49(4),

stating, roughly speaking, that if packets are allowed to stay put in buffers
only a limited number of time steps, $2d$, where $d$ is the longest
source-destination distance of any input packet, then the cardinality of the
optimal solution is decreased by only a constant factor. This claim was not
previously known in the directed integral (i.e., unsplittable, zero-one) case,
and may find additional applications for routing and scheduling algorithms.

currents on each chain, help to explain the distribution across the strip of
charge currents, both of the spin conserving and the spin flipping types. We
also predict the appearance of polarized charge currents on each chain.

introduce several phenomenological parameterizations of the Hubble expansion
rate to model different singularities existing in the literature and use SN Ia,

stellar objects reveals three major stellar aggregates within AFGL333, named
here AFGL333-main, AFGL333-NW1 and AFGL333-NW2. The disk fraction within
AFGL333 is estimated to be ~50-60%. We use the extinction map made from the
H-Ks colors of the background stars to understand the cloud structure and to
estimate the cloud mass. The CO-derived extinction map corroborates the cloud
structure and mass estimates from NIR color method. From the stellar mass and
cloud mass associated with AFGL333, we infer that the region is currently
forming stars with an efficiency of ~4.5% and at a rate of ~2 - 3 Msun

by Apern and Lidbetter [2013] for modeling problems such as searching for coal

be used to model a team of searchers successively splitting up in the search

ratio of an expanding search as the maximum over all vertices of the ratio of
the time taken to reach the vertex and the shortest-path cost to it from the

incurred in searching, and similar objectives have previously been studied in
the context of conventional (pathwise) search. In this paper we address
algorithmic and computational issues of minimizing the search ratio over all

invariance present in fractals and multifractal systems. The generalised
dimensions, specially the first three, are also often used to describe various
aspects of mass distribution in such systems. In this work we establish that
the graph (\textit{lacunarity curve}) depicting the variation of lacunarity
with scaling size, is non-linear in multifractal systems. We propose a
generalised relation between the Euclidean dimension, the Correlation Dimension
and the lacunarity of a system that lacks translational invariance, through the
slope of the lacunarity curve. Starting from the basic definitions of these
measures and using statistical mechanics, we track the standard algorithms- the
box counting algorithm for the determination of the generalised dimensions, and
the gliding box algorithm for lacunarity, to establish this relation. We go on
to validate the relation on six systems, three of which are deterministically
determined, while three others are real. Our examples span 2- and 3-
dimensional systems, and euclidean, monofractal and multifractal geometries. We
first determine the lacunarity of these systems using the gliding box
algorithm. In each of the six cases studied, the euclidean dimension, the
correlation dimension in case of multifractals, and the lacunarity of the
system, together, yield a value of the slope $S$ of the lacunarity curve at any
length scale. The predicted $S$ value matches the slope as determined from the
actual plot of the lacunarity curves at the corresponding length scales. This
establishes that the relation holds for systems of any geometry or dimension.

the strength of the reset mechanism, {\gamma} is the strength of decoherence

within Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs). Ongoing star formation within IRDCs is
typically still deeply embedded within the surrounding molecular gas.
Characterising the properties of relatively quiescent IRDCs may therefore help
us to understand the earliest phases of the star formation process. Studies of
local molecular clouds have revealed that deuterated species are enhanced in
the earliest phases of star formation. In this paper we test this towards IRDC
G035.39-00.33. We present an 80 arcsec by 140 arcsec map of the J=2-1
transition of N2D+, obtained with the IRAM-30m telescope. We find that N2D+ is
widespread throughout G035.39-00.33. Complementary observations of N2H+(1-0)
are used to estimate the deuterium fraction, N(N2D+)/N(N2H+). We report a mean
deuterium fraction of 0.04+-0.01, with a maximum of 0.09+-0.02. The mean
deuterium fraction is ~3 orders of magnitude greater than the interstellar
[D]/[H] ratio. High angular resolution observations are required to exclude
beam dilution effects of compact deuterated cores. Using chemical modelling, we
find that the average observed values of the deuterium fraction are in
agreement with an equilibrium deuterium fraction, given the general properties
of the cloud. This implies that the IRDC is at least ~3Myr old, which is ~8
times longer than the mean free-fall time of the observed deuterated region.

description of reflections via `sandwiching'. This extends to a description of
orthogonal transformations in general by means of `sandwiching' with Clifford
algebra multivectors, since all orthogonal transformations can be written as
products of reflections by the Cartan-Dieudonn\'e theorem. We begin by viewing
the largest non-crystallographic reflection/Coxeter group $H_4$ as a group of
rotations in two different ways -- firstly via a folding from the largest
exceptional group $E_8$, and secondly by induction from the icosahedral group
$H_3$ via Clifford spinors. We then generalise the second way by presenting a
construction of a 4D root system from any given 3D one. This affords a new --
spinorial -- perspective on 4D phenomena, in particular as the induced root
systems are precisely the exceptional ones in 4D, and their unusual
automorphism groups are easily explained in the spinorial picture; we discuss
the wider context of Platonic solids, Arnold's trinities and the McKay
correspondence. The multivector groups can be used to perform concrete
group-theoretic calculations, e.g. those for $H_3$ and $E_8$, and we discuss
how various representations can also be constructed in this Clifford framework;
in particular, representations of quaternionic type arise very naturally.

however, arise at the perturbative level, thus motivating a modification of the
original model. In order to agree with the latest Planck observations, we
modify the model such that the new dynamics can produce a relation between the
spectral index $n_{s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ allowed by the data.
By including an identical mass term for each of the fields of the system, we
find interesting dynamics leading to slow-roll inflation of the right length.
The presence of the mass term has the potential to modify the $n_{s}$ vs. $r$
relation so as to agree with the data. As a first step, we study the model at
zeroth order in cosmological perturbation theory, finding the conditions
required for slow-roll inflation and the number of e-foldings of inflation.
Numerical solutions are used to explore the impact of the mass term. We
conclude that the massive version of Gauge-flation offers a viable inflationary
model.

literature, our ISCA paper exposes the existence of disturbance errors in
commodity DRAM chips that are sold and used today. We show that repeatedly
reading from the same address could corrupt data in nearby addresses. More
specifically: When a DRAM row is opened (i.e., activated) and closed (i.e.,
precharged) repeatedly (i.e., hammered), it can induce disturbance errors in
adjacent DRAM rows. This failure mode is popularly called RowHammer. We tested
129 DRAM modules manufactured within the past six years (2008-2014) and found
110 of them to exhibit RowHammer disturbance errors, the earliest of which
dates back to 2010. In particular, all modules from the past two years
(2012-2013) were vulnerable, which implies that the errors are a recent
phenomenon affecting more advanced generations of process technology.
Importantly, disturbance errors pose an easily-exploitable security threat
since they are a breach of memory protection, wherein accesses to one page
(mapped to one row) modifies the data stored in another page (mapped to an
adjacent row).

non-crystallographic root system $H_4$. Arnold's trinities and the McKay
correspondence then hint that there might be an indirect connection between the
icosahedron and $E_8$. Secondly, in a related construction, I have now made
this connection explicit for the first time: in the 8D Clifford algebra of 3D
space the $120$ elements of the icosahedral group $H_3$ are doubly covered by
$240$ 8-component objects, which endowed with a `reduced inner product' are
exactly the $E_8$ root system. It was previously known that $E_8$ splits into
$H_4$-invariant subspaces, and we discuss the folding construction relating the
two pictures. This folding is a partial version of the one used for the
construction of the Coxeter plane, so thirdly we discuss the geometry of the
Coxeter plane in a Clifford algebra framework. We advocate the complete
factorisation of the Coxeter versor in the Clifford algebra into exponentials
of bivectors describing rotations in orthogonal planes with the rotation angle
giving the correct exponents, which gives much more geometric insight than the
usual approach of complexification and search for complex eigenvalues. In
particular, we explicitly find these factorisations for the 2D, 3D and 4D root
systems, $D_6$ as well as $E_8$, whose Coxeter versor factorises as
$W=\exp(\frac{\pi}{30}B_C)\exp(\frac{11\pi}{30}B_2)\exp(\frac{7\pi}{30}B_3)\exp(\frac{13\pi}{30}B_4)$.

  generalized cyclotomic classes modulo 2p",,,,,"math.NT cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We determine the exact values of the linear complexity of 2p-periodic
quaternary sequences over Z_4 (the residue class ring modulo 4) defined from
the generalized cyclotomic classes modulo 2p in terms of the theory of of
Galois rings of characteristic 4, where p is an odd prime. Compared to the case
of quaternary sequences over the finite field of order 4, it is more dificult
and complicated to consider the roots of polynomials in Z_4[X] due to the zero
divisors in Z_4 and hence brings some interesting twists. We answer an open
problem proposed by Kim, Hong and Song.

yielding sensible explanations to the subjacent dynamics. However, finite size
effects may prevent from discerning among different underlying physical
mechanisms and from determining whether a particular finite system is driven by
Barab\'asi-Albert dynamics. Here we propose master equations for the evolution
of the degrees, links and triangles distributions, solve them both analytically
and by numerical iteration, and compare with numerical simulations. The
analytic solutions for all these distributions predict the network evolution
for systems as small as 100 nodes. The analytic method we developed is
applicable for other classes of networks, representing a powerful tool to
investigate the evolution of natural networks.
