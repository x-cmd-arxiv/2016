which can be used for wave function analysis and visualization. The wave
function analysis module can calculate and generate 3D cubes for various types
of molecular orbitals and electron density of electronic excited states, such
as natural orbitals, natural transition orbitals, natural difference orbitals,
hole-particle density, detachment-attachment density and transition density.
The visualization module of GPView can display molecular and electronic
(iso-surfaces) structures. It is also able to animate single trajectories of
molecular dynamics and non-adiabatic excited state molecular dynamics using the
data stored in existing files. There are also other utilities to extract and
process the output of quantum chemistry calculations. The GPView provides full
graphic user interface (GUI), so it very easy to use. It is available from
website \href{http://life-tp.com/gpview}{http://life-tp.com/gpview}.

at the bed surface exceeds a minimum value $\Theta_c$. A large collection of
data, known as the Shields curve, shows that $\Theta_c$ is primarily a function
of the shear Reynolds number ${\rm{Re}}_*$. It is commonly assumed that
$\Theta>\Theta_c({\rm{Re}}_*)$ occurs when the ${\rm Re}_*$-dependent fluid
forces are too large to maintain static equilibrium for a typical surface
grain. A complimentary approach, which remains relatively unexplored, is to
identify $\Theta_c({\rm{Re}}_*)$ as the applied shear stress at which grains
cannot stop moving. With respect to grain dynamics, ${\rm{Re}}_*$ can be viewed
as the viscous time scale for a grain to equilibrate to the fluid flow divided
by the typical time for the fluid force to accelerate a grain over the
characteristic bed roughness. We performed simulations of granular beds sheared
by a model fluid, varying only these two time scales. We find that the critical
Shields number $\Theta_c({\rm Re}_*)$ obtained from the model mimics the
Shields curve and is insensitive to the grain properties, the model fluid flow,
and the form of the drag law. Quantitative discrepancies between the model
results and the Shields curve are consistent with previous calculations of lift
forces at varying ${\rm Re}_*$. Grains at low ${\rm Re}_*$ find more stable
configurations than those at high ${\rm{Re}}_*$ due to differences in the grain
reorganization dynamics. Thus, instead of focusing on mechanical equilibrium of
a typical grain at the bed surface, $\Theta_c({\rm{Re}}_*)$ may be better
described by the stress at which mobile grains cannot find a stable
configuration and stop moving.

of quasitwo-dimensional twist-bend nematic (Ntb) drops formed within a planarly
aligned nematic layer of the liquid crystal CB7CB. Initially, at the setting
point of the Ntb phase, the drops assume a nonequilibrium cusped elliptical
geometry with the major axis orthogonal to the director of the surrounding
nematic fluid; this growth is governed principally by anisotropic heat
diffusion. The drops attain equilibrium through thermally driven dynamical
evolutions close to their melting temperature. They are associated with a
characteristic twin-striped morphology that transforms into the familiar focal
conic texture as the temperature is lowered. At equilibrium, large millimetric
drops are tactoidlike, elongated along the director of the surrounding nematic

dimensionless parameters, of which one is the structural cone angle of the Ntb
phase and the other, the relative strength of mismatch elastic energy at the
drop's interface. Both parameters are extracted from the observations by
measuring the aspect ratio of the equilibrium shapes and the inner corner angle
of the cusps.

all particles. However, polarizable objects may experience van der Waals shifts
when they pass the grating walls and the undesired dephasing may prevent
interferometry with massive objects. Here we explore how to minimize this
perturbation by reducing the thickness of the diffraction mask to its ultimate
physical limit, i.e. the thickness of a single atom. We have fabricated
diffraction masks in single-layer and bilayer graphene as well as in 1 nm thin
carbonaceous biphenyl membrane. We identify conditions to transform an array of
single layer graphene nanoribbons into a grating of carbon nanoscrolls. We show
that all these ultra-thin nanomasks can be used for high-contrast quantum
diffraction of massive molecules. They can be seen as a nanomechanical answer
to the question debated by Bohr and Einstein whether a softly suspended double
slit would destroy quantum interference. In agreement with Bohr's reasoning we
show that quantum coherence prevails even in the limit of atomically thin
gratings.

gamma-ray (~0.4 - 10 MeV) detectors capable of making sensitive observations. A
fast scintillator- based Compton telescope with SiPM readouts is a promising
solution to this instrumentation challenge, since the fast response of the
scintillators permits the rejection of background via time-of-flight (ToF)
discrimination. The Solar Compton Telescope (SolCompT) prototype was designed
to demonstrate stable performance of this technology under balloon-flight
conditions. The SolCompT instrument was a simple two-element Compton telescope,
consisting of an approximately one-inch cylindrical stilbene crystal for a
scattering detector and a one-inch cubic LaBr3:Ce crystal for a calorimeter
detector. Both scintillator detectors were read out by 2 x 2 arrays of
Hamamatsu S11828-3344 MPPC devices. Custom front-end electronics provided
optimum signal rise time and linearity, and custom power supplies automatically
adjusted the SiPM bias voltage to compensate for temperature-induced gain
variations. A tagged calibration source, consisting of ~240 nCi of Co-60
embedded in plastic scintillator, was placed in the field of view and provided
a known source of gamma rays to measure in flight. The SolCompT balloon payload
was launched on 24 August 2014 from Fort Sumner, NM, and spent ~3.75 hours at a
float altitude of ~123,000 feet. The instrument performed well throughout the
flight. After correcting for small (~10%) residual gain variations, we measured
an in-flight ToF resolution of ~760 ps (FWHM). Advanced scintillators with SiPM
readouts continue to show great promise for future gamma-ray instruments.

close binaries may take place over similar timescales to that around single

based on a single column density map. Such profiles are often critical to
understand the physics and chemistry of molecular cloud cores, in which star
formation takes place. The method presented here does not assume any geometry
for the object being studied, thus removing a significant source of bias.
Instead it exploits contour self-similarity in column density maps which
appears to be common in data for astronomical objects. Our method may be
applied to many types of astronomical objects and observable quantities so long
as they satisfy a limited set of conditions which we describe in detail. We
derive the method analytically, test it numerically, and illustrate its utility
using 2MASS-derived dust extinction in molecular cloud cores. While not having
made an extensive comparison of different density profiles, we find that the
overall radial density distribution within molecular cloud cores is adequately
described by an attenuated power law.

  Journal on Uncertainty Quantification",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a method for optimal control of systems governed by partial
differential equations (PDEs) with uncertain parameter fields. We consider an
objective function that involves the mean and variance of the control
objective, leading to a risk-averse optimal control problem. To make the
problem tractable, we invoke a quadratic Taylor series approximation of the
control objective with respect to the uncertain parameter. This enables
deriving explicit expressions for the mean and variance of the control
objective in terms of its gradients and Hessians with respect to the uncertain
parameter. The risk-averse optimal control problem is then formulated as a
PDE-constrained optimization problem with constraints given by the forward and
adjoint PDEs defining these gradients and Hessians. The expressions for the
mean and variance of the control objective under the quadratic approximation
involve the trace of the (preconditioned) Hessian and are thus prohibitive to
evaluate. To address this, we employ trace estimators that only require a
modest number of Hessian-vector products. We illustrate our approach with two
problems: the control of a semilinear elliptic PDE with an uncertain boundary
source term, and the control of a linear elliptic PDE with an uncertain
coefficient field. For the latter problem, we derive adjoint-based expressions
for efficient computation of the gradient of the risk-averse objective with
respect to the controls. Our method ensures that the cost of computing the
risk-averse objective and its gradient with respect to the control, measured in
the number of PDE solves, is independent of the (discretized) parameter and
control dimensions, and depends only on the number of random vectors employed
in the trace estimation. Finally, we present a comprehensive numerical study of
an optimal control problem for fluid flow in a porous medium with uncertain
permeability field.

on the relative values of the positions and each of them submits a single bid
that is interpreted in terms of these values. Motivated by current practice in
sponsored search we consider a situation where the auctioneer uses estimates of
the relative values, which may be imprecise, and show that under both complete
and incomplete information a non-truthful mechanism is able to support an
efficient outcome in equilibrium for a wider range of these estimates than the
VCG mechanism. We thus exhibit a property of the VCG mechanism that may help
explain the surprising rarity with which it is used even in settings with unit
demand, a relative lack of robustness to misspecification of the bidding
language. The result for complete information concerns the generalized
second-price mechanism and lends additional theoretical support to the use of
this mechanism in practice. Particularly interesting from a technical
perspective is the result for incomplete information, which is driven by a
surprising connection between equilibrium bids in the VCG mechanism and the
generalized first-price mechanism.

absent. A large absorption peak appears at resonance as the control field is
switched on. We show how such a large absorption leads to optical switching.
Further, this large absorption gets diminished and a transparency window
appears due to the saturation effects as the strength of the probe field is
increased. We further demonstrate that the threshold of the optical bistability
can be modified by suitable choices of the coupling and the control fields. In
a four-level Y-type configuration, the effect of the control field on saturable

region at different energies. We combine the data of the source monitoring in
the visible band with the X-ray data of the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on
board of SWIFT satellite and Chandra X-ray observatory. Inspecting the broad
band spectrum and lightcurves of the source we identify several microlensing
caustic crossing events, and study the details of variability of the source
during these events. The caustic crossings of image A on MJD 55150 and 55500
produce strong variations of the overall X-ray flux from the source. In the
soft X-ray band, the caustic crossing events are characterised by the
exponential growth / decay of the flux ratio between the source images with the
exponentiating time scale T_d~60 d, which corresponds to the caustic transit
time of the source of the size ~10^{14} cm. Variability induced by the
microlensing dominates the overall variability of the sum of the fluxes of four

lightcurve, if the hard X-ray source is comparably compact. Non-detection of
the caustic crossing events in the SWIFT/BAT lightcurve of the source indicates

criteria is addressed. It is demonstrated that an attacker's success
probabilities are the fundamental criteria of security that any theoretic
security criterion must relate to in order to have operational significance.
The errors committed in the prevalent interpretation of the trace distance
criterion are analyzed. The security proofs of QKD protocols are discussed and
assessed in regard to three main features: their validity, completeness, and
adequacy of the achieved numerical security level. Problems are identified in
all these features. It appears that the QKD security situation is quite
different from the common perception that a QKD-generated key is nearly
perfectly secure. Built into our discussion is a simple but complete

spinor Bose-Einstein condensate subject to a quantum ratchet realized with a

neutrality, using a game-theoretic model of provider interactions based on a
two-sided market framework: we assume that the platform--the last-mile access
providers (ISPs)--are monopolists, and consider content providers (CPs) entry
decisions. All decisions affect the choices made by users, who are sensitive
both to CP and ISP investments (in content creation and quality-of-service,
respectively). In a non-neutral regime, CPs and ISPs can charge each other,
while such charges are prohibited in the neutral regime. We assume those
charges (if any) are chosen by CPs, a direction rarely considered in the
literature, where they are assumed fixed by ISPs.
  Our analysis suggests that, unexpectedly, more CPs enter the market in a
non-neutral regime where they pay ISPs, than without such payments.
Additionally, in this case ISPs tend to invest more than in the neutral regime.
From our results, the best regime in terms of user welfare is parameter
dependent, calling for caution in designing neutrality regulations.

cache inventories are updated in a way that provides content diversity to users
who are covered by, and thus have access to, more than one station. Two
variations are proposed, namely the multi-LRU-One and -All, which differ in the
number of replicas inserted in the involved caches. By introducing spatial
approximations, we propose a Che-like method to predict the hit probability,
which gives very accurate results under the Independent Reference Model (IRM).
It is shown that the performance of multi-LRU increases the more the

in many other real networks: the arrangement of brain regions into modules and
the presence of highly connected regions (hubs) forming rich-clubs. Here, we
examine how modules and hubs shape the collective dynamics on networks and we
find that both ingredients lead to the emergence of complex dynamics. Comparing
the connectomes of C. elegans, cats, macaques and humans to surrogate networks
in which either modules or hubs are destroyed, we find that functional
complexity always decreases in the perturbed networks. A comparison between
simulated and empirically obtained resting-state functional connectivity
indicates that the human brain, at rest, lies in a dynamical state that
reflects the largest complexity its anatomical connectome can host. Last, we
generalise the topology of neural connectomes into a new hierarchical network
model that successfully combines modular organisation with rich-club forming
hubs. This is achieved by centralising the cross-modular connections through a
preferential attachment rule. Our network model hosts more complex dynamics
than other hierarchical models widely used as benchmarks.

among software artifacts. One state-of-practice approach to structure
information is to establish trace links between artifacts, a practice that is
also enforced by several development standards. Unfortunately, manually
maintaining trace links in an evolving system is a tedious task. To tackle this
issue, several researchers have proposed treating the capture and recovery of
trace links as an Information Retrieval (IR) problem. The work contains a
Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of previous evaluations of IR-based trace
recovery. We show that a majority of previous evaluations have been
technology-oriented, conducted in ""the cave of IR evaluation"", using small
datasets as experimental input. Also, software artifacts originating from
student projects have frequently been used in evaluations. We conducted a
survey among traceability researchers, and found that a majority consider
student artifacts to be only partly representative to industrial counterparts.
Our findings call for additional case studies to evaluate IR-based trace
recovery within the full complexity of an industrial setting. Also, this thesis
contributes to the body of empirical evidence of IR-based trace recovery in two
experiments with industrial software artifacts. The technology-oriented
experiment highlights the clear dependence between datasets and the accuracy of
IR-based trace recovery, in line with findings from the SLR. The human-oriented
experiment investigates how different quality levels of tool output affect the
tracing accuracy of engineers. Finally, we present how tools and methods are
evaluated in the general field of IR research, and propose a taxonomy of
evaluation contexts tailored for IR-based trace recovery.

can traverse the length at which the Nambu-Goto ground state becomes tachyonic,

excitation energies in SU(4) and SU(6) suggests that the massive world sheet
excitation associated with the k=2 binding has a scale that knows about the
group and hence the theory in the bulk, and we comment on the potential
implications of world sheet massive modes for the bulk spectrum. We provide a

clouds region at separations between 100 and 1000 AU. These data were acquired
at 1.6~$\mu$m with the NICMOS and WFC3 cameras on the Hubble Space Telescope.
Additional photometry was obtained for some of the sources at 2.05~$\mu$m with
NICMOS and in the $L'$-band with NSFCAM2 on the IRTF. Towards 129 protostars
and 197 pre-main sequence stars with disks observed with WFC3, we detect 21 and
28 candidate companions between the projected separations of 100---1000 AU, of
which less than 5 and 8, respectively, are chance line of sight coincidences.
The resulting companion fraction ($CF$) after the correction for the line of
sight contamination is 14.4$^{+1.1}_{-1.3}$% for protostars and
12.5$^{+1.2}_{-0.8}$% for the pre-main sequence stars. These values are similar
to those found for main sequence stars, suggesting that there is little
variation in the $CF$ with evolution, although several observational biases may
mask a decrease in the $CF$ from protostars to the main sequence stars. After
segregating the sample into two populations based on the surrounding surface
density of YSOs, we find that the $CF$ in the high stellar density regions
($\Sigma_{YSO} > 45$~pc$^{-2}$) is approximately 50% higher than that found in
the low stellar density regions ($\Sigma_{YSO} < 45$~pc$^{-2}$). We interpret
this as evidence for the elevated formation of companions at 100 to 1000 AU in
the denser environments of Orion. We discuss possible reasons for this elevated
formation.

only from the satellite communication community, but also from researchers
active in fields like Internet of Things and machine-to-machine. Asynchronous
(slot- and frame-wise) ALOHA-like random access protocols, are very attractive
for such applications, enabling low complexity transmitters and avoiding time
synchronization requirements. Evolutions of ALOHA employ time diversity through
proactive replication of packets, but the time diversity is not fully exploited
at the receiver. Combining techniques, as selection combining and maximal-ratio
combining, are beneficial and are adopted in the enhanced contention resolution
ALOHA (ECRA) scheme, presented here. A tight approximation of the packet loss
rate for asynchronous random access, including ECRA, well suited for the low
channel load region is derived. Finally, ECRA is evaluated in terms of spectral
efficiency, throughput and packet loss rate in comparison with recent
protocols, showing that it is able to largely outperform both slotted
synchronous and asynchronous schemes.

Equivalence Principle via observations of time delays between photons of
different radio frequencies by \citet{wei15}. These limits on differential
post-Newtonian parameters ($\Delta \gamma<2.52\times10^{-8}$) are the best yet
achieved but still rely on uncertain assumptions, namely the relative
contributions of dispersion and gravitational delays to the observed time
delays and the distances to FRBs. Also very recently, the first FRB host galaxy
has likely been identified, providing the first redshift-based distance
estimate to FRB 150418 \citep{kea16}. Moreover, consistency between the
\omegaigm\ estimate from FRB 150418 and \omegaigm~expected from $\Lambda$CDM
models and WMAP observations leads one to conclude that the observed time delay
for FRB 150418 is highly dominated by dispersion, with any gravitational delays
small contributors. This points to even tighter limits on $\Delta \gamma$. In
this paper, the technique of \citet{wei15} is applied to FRB 150418 to produce
a limit of $\Delta \gamma < 1 - 2\times10^{-9}$, approximately an order of
magnitude better than previous limits and in line with expectations by
\citet{wei15} for what could be achieved if the dispersive delay is separated
from other effects. Future substantial improvements in such limits will depend
on accurately determining the contribution of individual ionized components to
the total observed time delays for FRBs.

Rhea's southern winter pole is one of the coldest places directly observed in
our solar system: temperatures of 25.4+/-7.4 K and 24.7+/-6.8 K are inferred.
The surface temperature of the northern summer pole is warmer: 66.6+/-0.6 K.
Assuming the surface thermophysical properties of both polar regions are
comparable then these temperatures can be considered a summer and winter
seasonal temperature constraint for the polar region. These observations
provide solar longitude coverage at 133 deg and 313 deg for the summer and
winter poles respectively, with additional winter temperature constraint at 337
deg. Seasonal models with bolometric albedos of 0.70-0.74 and thermal inertias
of 1-46 MKS can provide adequate fits to these temperature constraints. Both
these albedo and thermal inertia values agree (within error) with those
previously observed on both Rhea's leading and trailing hemispheres.
Investigating the seasonal temperature change of Rhea's surface is particularly
important, as the seasonal wave is sensitive to deeper surface temperatures
(~10cm to m) than the more commonly reported diurnal wave (<1cm). The low
thermal inertia derived here implies that Rhea's polar surfaces are highly
porous even at great depths. Analysis of a CIRS 10 to 600 cm-1 stare
observation, taken between 16:22:33 and 16:23:26 UT on 2013/03/09 centered on
71.7 W, 58.7 S provides the first analysis of a thermal emissivity spectrum on
Rhea. The results show a flat emissivity spectrum with negligible emissivity
features. A few possible explanations exist for this flat emissivity spectrum,
but the most likely for Rhea is that the surface is both highly porous and
composed of small particles (less than approximately 50 um).

hadro-dynamics by including contributions from two-loop (TL) diagrams arising
from the exchange of iso-scalar and iso-vector mesons between nucleons. Our
extension of mean-field theory (MFT) employs the same five density-independent
coupling strengths which are calibrated using the empirical properties at the
equilibrium density of iso-spin symmetric matter. Results of calculations from
the MFT and TL approximations are compared for conditions of density,
temperature, and proton fraction encountered in astrophysics applications
involving compact objects. The TL results for the equation of state (EOS) of
cold pure neutron matter at sub- and near-nuclear densities agree well with
those of modern quantum Monte Carlo and effective field-theoretical approaches.
Although the high-density EOS in the TL approximation for neutron-star matter
is substantially softer than its MFT counterpart, it is able to support a
$2M_\odot$ neutron star required by recent precise determinations. In addition,
radii of $1.4M_\odot$ stars are smaller by $\sim 1$ km than obtained in MFT. In
contrast to MFT, the TL results also give a better account of the
single-particle or optical potentials extracted from analyses of medium-energy
proton-nucleus and heavy-ion experiments. In degenerate conditions, the thermal
variables are well reproduced by results of Landau's Fermi-Liquid theory in
which density-dependent effective masses feature prominently. The ratio of the
thermal components of pressure and energy density expressed as
$\Gamma_{th}=1+(P_{th}/\epsilon_{th})$, often used in astrophysical
simulations, exhibits a stronger dependence on density than on proton fraction
and temperature in both MFT and TL calculations. The prominent peak of
$\Gamma_{th}$ at supra-nuclear density found in MFT is, however, suppressed in
TL calculations.

meta-level where game-theoretic logical semantics is applied to ATL. We unify
these two perspectives into semantic evaluation games specially designed for

unbounded and (ordinal) bounded GTS and prove these to be equivalent to the
standard (Tarski-style) compositional semantics. We show that in these both

guarantees although there exist classical algorithms that have better

theoretic assumptions, the output distribution of even the lowest depth version
cannot be efficiently simulated on any classical device. We contrast this with
the case of sampling from the output of a quantum computer running the Quantum
Adiabatic Algorithm (QADI) with the restriction that the Hamiltonian that
governs the evolution is gapped and stoquastic. Here we show that there is an
oracle that would allow sampling from the QADI but even with this oracle, if
one could efficiently classically sample from the output of the QAOA, the
Polynomial Hierarchy would collapse. This suggests that the QAOA is an
excellent candidate to run on near term quantum computers not only because it
may be of use for optimization but also because of its potential as a route to
establishing quantum supremacy.

kinematics in the Gaia observable space. We also estimate the Gaia capabilities
of detecting the predicted signatures. We use both controlled orbital
integrations in analytic potentials and self-consistent simulations. We
introduce a new strategy, which consists of comparing the stellar kinematics of
symmetric Galactic longitudes (+l and -l), in particular the median transverse
velocity (from parallaxes and proper motions). This approach does not require
the assumption of an axisymmetric model. The typical differences between the
transverse velocity in symmetric longitudes in the models are of ~2 km/s, but
can be larger than 10 km/s for certain longitudes and distances. The kinematic
differences for +l and -l show trends that depend on the properties of spiral
arms. Thus, this method can be used to quantify the importance of the effects
of spiral arms on the orbits of stars in the different disk regions, and to
constrain the location of the arms, main resonances and, thus, pattern speed.
Moreover, the method allows us to test the dynamical nature of the spiral
structure (e.g. grand design versus transient multiple arms). We estimate the
number of stars of each spectral type that Gaia will observe in representative
Galactic longitudes, their errors in distance and transverse velocity, and the
error in computing the median velocity as a function of distance. We will be
able to measure the median transverse velocity with Gaia data, with precision
smaller than ~1 km/s up to distances of ~4-6 kpc for certain giant stars, and
up to ~2-4 kpc and better kinematic precision (<= 0.5 km\s) for certain
sub-giants and dwarfs. These are enough to measure the typical signatures seen
in the models. We also show that a similar strategy can be used with
line-of-sight velocities from other upcoming spectroscopic surveys.(Abridged)

this peculiar class of systems. We investigate here the relation between the
dynamical, stellar and gaseous disk center and the bar. In all our simulations
the bar center always coincides with the dynamical center, while the stellar
disk becomes highly asymmetric during the encounter causing the photometric
center of the Magellanic galaxy disk to become mismatched with both the bar and
the dynamical center. The disk asymmetries persist for almost 2 Gyrs, the time
that it takes for the disk to be re-centered with the bar, and well after the
companion has passed. This explains the nature of the offset bar found in many
Magellanic-type galaxies, including the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and NGC
3906. In particular, these results, once applied to the LMC, suggest that the
dynamical center should reside in the bar center instead of the HI center as

$\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(N)$ gauge theory sector, which we obtain from a twisted
dimensional reduction of a seven-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ $SU(N)$ gauge
theory on the surface $S$. A variant of the Vafa-Witten equations governs the
moduli space of the gauge theory, which, for a trivial $SU(N)$ principal bundle
over $S$, admits a Coulomb and a Higgs branch. In M-theory these two gauge
theory branches arise from a resolution and a deformation to smooth Calabi-Yau
fourfolds, respectively. We find that the deformed Calabi-Yau fourfold
associated to the Higgs branch requires for consistency a non-trivial four-form
background flux in M-theory. The flat directions of the flux-induced
superpotential are in agreement with the gauge theory prediction for the moduli
space of the Higgs branch. We illustrate our findings with explicit examples
that realize the Coulomb and Higgs phase transition in Calabi-Yau fourfolds
embedded in weighted projective spaces. We generalize and enlarge this class of
examples to Calabi-Yau fourfolds embedded in toric varieties with an $A_{N-1}$

cooling luminosity of up to ~ 1e38(M_gas/1e6 Msun)^2 erg/s. The Lya production
rate can be significantly larger during the final stages of collapse, but
collisional deexcitation efficiently suppresses the emerging Lya flux.
Photoionization by a central source boosts the Lya luminosity to
L~1e43(M_BH/1e6 M_sun) erg/s during specific evolutionary stages of the cloud,
where M_BH denotes the mass of the black hole powering this source. We predict
that the width and velocity off-set of the Lya spectral line range from a few
tens to few thousands km/s, depending sensitively on the evolutionary state of
the cloud. We also compare our predictions to observations of CR7 (Sobral et
al. 2015), a luminous Lya emitter at z~7, which is potentially associated with
a DCBH. If CR7 is powered by a black hole, then its Lya flux alone requires
that M_BH> 1e7 M_sun, which exceeds the mass of DCBHs when they first form. The
observed width of the Lya spectrum favors the presence of only a low column
density of hydrogen, log [N_HI/cm^-2]~19-20. The shape of the Lya spectrum
indicates that this gas is outflowing. These requirements imply that if CR7
harbors a DCBH, then the physical conditions that enabled its formation have
been mostly erased, which is in agreement with theoretical expectations.

the formation of a debris disk around the BH/NS. Efficient accretion of a
fraction $(f_{acc}=0.1$ of the debris may then give rise to bright energetic
long ($10^{3}-10^{4}\,s$), X-ray/Gamma-ray flares, with total energies of up to

resembling ultra-long GRBs/XRFs. The energy of such flares depends on the
poorly constrained accretion processes. Significantly fainter flares might be
produced if most of the disk mass is blown away through strong outflows. We
suggest three dynamical origins for such disruptions. In the first, a
star/planet is tidally disrupted following a close random encounter with a
BH/NS in a dense cluster. We estimate the BH (NS) micro-TDE rates from this

Milky-Way galaxy. Another scenario involves the interaction of wide companions
due to perturbations by stars in the field, likely producing comparable but
lower rates. Finally, a third scenario involves a BH/NS which gain a natal
velocity kick at birth, leading to a close encounter with a binary companion
and the tidal disruption of that companion. Such events could be associated
with a supernova, or even with a preceding GRB/XRF event, and would likely
occur hours to days after the prompt explosion; the rates of such events could
be larger than those obtained from the other scenarios, depending on the

simulations in the context of large scale general relativistic effects. We look
for simple modifications to the nonlinear evolution of the gravitational
potential $\psi$ that lead on large scales to the correct, fully relativistic
description of density perturbations in the Newtonian gauge. We note that the
relativistic constraint equation for $\psi$ can be cast as a diffusion
equation, with a diffusion length scale determined by the expansion of the
Universe. Exploiting the weak time evolution of $\psi$ in all regimes of
interest, this equation can be further accurately approximated as a Helmholtz
equation, with an effective relativistic 'screening' scale $\ell$ related to
the Hubble radius. We demonstrate that it is thus possible to carry out N-body
simulations in the Newtonian gauge by replacing Poisson's equation with this
Helmholtz equation, involving a trivial change in the Green's function kernel.
Our results also motivate a simple, approximate (but very accurate) gauge
transformation - $\delta_{\rm N}(\mathbf{k}) \approx \delta_{\rm
sim}(\mathbf{k})\times (k^2+\ell^{-2})/k^2$ - to convert the density field
$\delta_{\rm sim}$ of standard collisionless N-body simulations (initialised in
the comoving synchronous gauge) into the Newtonian gauge density $\delta_{\rm
N}$ at arbitrary times. A similar conversion can also be written in terms of
particle positions. Our results can be interpreted in terms of a Jeans
stability criterion induced by the expansion of the Universe. The appearance of
the screening scale $\ell$ in the evolution of $\psi$, in particular, leads to
a natural resolution of the 'Jeans swindle' in the presence of super-horizon
modes.

slightly blueshifted or at the systemic velocity of the galaxy. Taken together,
the velocity structure of the MgII and FeII emission is consistent with arising
through scattering in galactic winds. Assuming a thin shell geometry for the

the various observing epochs and between different interferometric data types,
with the latter providing significant support for this class of models of Sgr

magnitude and its orientation within this model context, finding a spin
magnitude of $a=0.10^{+0.30+0.56}_{-0.10-0.10}$, an inclination with respect to
the line of sight of
$\theta={60^\circ}^{+5^\circ+10^\circ}_{-8^\circ-13^\circ}$, and a position
angle of $\xi={156^\circ}^{+10^\circ+14^\circ}_{-17^\circ-27^\circ}$ east of

previous $180^\circ$ degeneracy in the position angle has now been conclusively
broken by the inclusion of the closure phase measurements. A reflection
degeneracy in the inclination remains, permitting two localizations of the spin
vector orientation, one of which is in agreement with the orbital angular
momentum of the infrared gas cloud G2 and the clockwise disk of young stars.
This possibly supports a relationship between Sgr A*'s accretion flow and these
larger-scale features.

loop contribution from the $W'$. To initiate gluon fusion production, it is
necessary to extend the G221 symmetry to the Pati-Salam and SO(10) symmetry. We
investigate the possibilities that the light colored scalars or vectorlike
fermions survive in the SO(10) theory and provide large gluon fusion rate for
the diphoton signature. It is possible to test the G221 interpretation by
direct searches of W' using the multi-gauge boson production channel at the Run
2 LHC.

rapid electromagnetic follow-up is required to understand the astrophysical

radiation are likely to reside in galaxies, it would make sense to search first
in regions where the LIGO-Virgo probability is large and where the density of
galaxies is large as well. Under the assumption that the probability of a
gravitational-wave event from a given region of space is proportional to the
density of galaxies within the probed volume, one can calculate an improved
localisation of the position of the source simply by multiplying the LIGO-Virgo

interferometry is set to revolutionize studies of the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and
epoch of reionization (EoR), eventually resulting in 3D maps of the first
billion years of our Universe. Progress will depend on sophisticated data
analysis pipelines, which are in turn tested on large-scale mock observations.
Here we present the 2016 EOS data release, consisting of the largest (1.6 Gpc
on side with a 1024^3 grid), public 21-cm simulations of the CD and EoR. We
include calibrated, sub-grid prescriptions for inhomogeneous recombinations and
photo-heating suppression of star formation in small mass galaxies. We present
two simulation runs that approximately bracket the contribution from faint
unseen galaxies. From these two extremes, we predict that the duration of
reionization (defined as a change in the mean neutral fraction from 0.9 to 0.1)
should be between 2.7 < Delta z < 5.7. The large-scale 21-cm power during the
advanced EoR stages can be different by up to a factor of ~10, depending on the
model. This difference has a comparable contribution from: (i) the typical bias
of sources; and (ii) a more efficient negative feedback in models with an
extended EoR driven by faint galaxies. We also make detectability forecasts.
With a 1000h integration, HERA and SKA1-low should achieve a signal-to-noise of
~few-hundreds throughout the EoR/CD, while in the maximally optimistic scenario
of perfect foreground cleaning, all instruments should make a statistical
detection of the cosmic signal. We also caution that our ability to clean
foregrounds determines the relative performance of narrow/deep vs. wide/shallow
surveys expected with SKA1. Our 21-cm power spectra, simulation outputs and

for the interfaces in many natural environments, such as the oceans. For both
boundary conditions the flow is dominated by fingers and the global responses
follow the same scaling laws, with enhanced prefactors for the free-slip cases.
Therefore, the laboratory experiments with the no-slip boundaries serve as a
good model for the finger layers in the ocean. Moreover, in the free-slip case
although the tangential shear stress is eliminated at the boundaries, the local
dissipation rate in the near-wall region may exceed the value found in the
no-slip cases, which is caused by the stronger vertical motions of fingers and
sheet structures near the free-slip boundaries. This counter intuitive result
might be relevant for properly estimating and modelling the mixing and

expanding ring of shocked molecular gas centered on the exciting star cluster
NGC346, whereas a more distant dense molecular cloud is being eroded by UV
radiation from the same cluster. In the N25+N26 and N88 maps, diffuse [CII]
emission at a relatively low surface brightness extends well beyond the compact
boundaries of the bright emission associated with the [CII] regions. In all
regions, the distribution of this bright [CII] emission and the less prominent
[CI] emission closely follows the outline of the CO complexes, but the
intensity of the [CII] and [CI] emission is generally anticorrelated, which can
be understood by the action of photodissociation and photoionization processes.
Notwithstanding the overall similarity of CO and [CII] maps, the intensity
ratio of these lines varies significantly, mostly due to changes in CO
brightness. [CII] emission line profiles are up to 50% wider in velocity than
corresponding CO profiles. A radiative transfer analysis shows that the [CII]
line is the dominant tracer of (CO-dark) molecular hydrogen in the SMC. CO
emission traces only a minor fraction of the total amount of gas. The
similarity of the spatial distribution and line profile shape, and the
dominance of molecular gas associated with [[CII] rather than CO emission imply
that in the low-metallicity environment of the SMC the small amount of dense
molecular gas traced by CO is embedded in the much more extended molecular gas
traced only by [CII] emission. The contribution from neutral atomic and ionized
hydrogen zones is negligible in the star-forming regions observed.

  Superradiance is a radiation enhancement process that involves rotating
dissipative systems. In BH spacetimes, superradiance is due to dissipation at
the event horizon, with interesting associated phenomena, namely floating
orbits and BH-bombs. BH superradiance is a very interdisciplinary topic, and
its study allows us to obtain important results in the area of particle
physics. The scattering of a scalar field by a rotating BH leads to the
formation of quasi-boundstates. In rotational systems, these states can give
rise to superradiant instabilities. These results were recently used to impose
constraints to the mass of fundamental particles and darkmatter candidates.
  In this work, it is shown that, when dissipation is properly included,
similar results are achievable in self-gravitating systems other than
black-holes, such as perfect fluid stars. It is also demonstrated that the
relativistic effects related to the phenomenon of frame-dragging are
neglectable in this calculation.

empirical error is close to its true error---is surprisingly brittle. As has
recently been noted in [DFH+15b], even if several algorithms have this
guarantee in isolation, the guarantee need not hold if the algorithms are
composed adaptively. In this paper, we study three notions of
generalization---increasing in strength---that are robust to postprocessing and
amenable to adaptive composition, and examine the relationships between them.
We call the weakest such notion Robust Generalization. A second, intermediate,
notion is the stability guarantee known as differential privacy. The strongest
guarantee we consider we call Perfect Generalization. We prove that every
hypothesis class that is PAC learnable is also PAC learnable in a robustly

random walk. While there are some results on the cover time of the rotor-router
model, which is a deterministic random walk corresponding to a simple random
walk, nothing is known about the cover time of deterministic random walks
emulating general transition probabilities. This paper is concerned with the
SRT-router model with multiple tokens, which is a deterministic process coping
with general transition probabilities possibly containing irrational numbers.
For the model, we give an upper bound of the cover time, which is the first
result on the cover time of deterministic random walks for general transition
probabilities. Our upper bound also improves the existing bounds for the
rotor-router model in some cases.

millimeter (mmWave) frequencies, roughly above 10~GHz, have been attracting
growing attention for next-generation micro- and pico- cellular wireless
networks. A fundamental and open question is how these bands should be used by
cellular operators. Cellular spectrum has been traditionally allocated
following an exclusive ownership model. However, in this paper we argue that
the distinct nature of mmWave communication -- the massive bandwidth degrees of
freedom, directional isolation and high susceptibility to blockage -- suggest
that spectrum and infrastructure sharing between multiple operators may be
necessary to exploit the full potential of these bands. High-level capacity
analyses are presented that reveal significant possible gains under spectrum
and infrastructure sharing, even under minimal coordination between operators.
Moreover, we discuss how network technologies including software defined
networks (SDNs) and network function virtualization (NFV) can easily enable
resource sharing by having a programmable core entity provide transparent

analyzing thermal transport in structures that have real-space roughness or are
too large to simulate directly using atomistic techniques. PMC hinges on the
generation and use of \textit{random variates} -- specific values of the random
variables that correspond to physical observables -- in a way that accurately
and efficiently captures the appropriate distribution functions. We present the
relative merits of the inversion and rejection techniques for generating random
variates on several examples relevant in thermal transport: drawing phonons
from a thermal distribution and with full or isotropic dispersion, randomizing
outgoing momentum upon diffuse boundary scattering, implementing contacts
(boundary and internal), and conserving energy in the simulation. We also
identify common themes in phonon generation and scattering that are helpful for
reusing code in the simulation (generating thermal-phonon attributes vs
internal contacts; diffuse surface scattering vs boundary contacts). We hope
these examples will inform the reader about the mechanics of random-variate
generation and how to choose a good approach for whatever problem is at hand,

  Using Moving Horizon Estimation",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates robust fault diagnosis of multiple air data sensor
faults in the presence of winds. The trade-off between robustness to winds and
sensitivity to faults is challenging due to simultaneous influence of winds and
latent faults on monitored sensors. Different from conventional residual
generators that do not consider any constraints, we propose a constrained
residual generator using moving horizon estimation. The main contribution is
improved fault sensitivity by exploiting known bounds on winds in residual
generation. By analyzing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the formulated
moving horizon estimation problem, it is shown that this improvement is
attributed to active inequality constraints caused by faults. When the
weighting matrices in the moving horizon estimation problem are tuned to
increase robustness to winds, its fault sensitivity does not simply decrease as
one would expect in conventional unconstrained residual generators. Instead,
its fault sensitivity increases when the fault is large enough to activate some
inequality constraints. This fault sensitivity improvement is not restricted to
this particular application, but can be achieved by any general moving horizon
estimation based residual generator. A high-fidelity Airbus simulator is used
to illustrate the advantage of our proposed approach in terms of fault
sensitivity.

good performance across application domains and languages. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of the mention detection systems, one of the
fundamental tasks in information extraction, via recurrent neural networks
(RNNs). The advantage of RNNs over the traditional approaches is their capacity
to capture long ranges of context and implicitly adapt the word embeddings,
trained on a large corpus, into a task-specific word representation, but still
preserve the original semantic generalization to be helpful across domains. Our
systematic evaluation for RNN architectures demonstrates that RNNs not only
outperform the best reported systems (up to 9\% relative error reduction) in
the general setting but also achieve the state-of-the-art performance in the
cross-domain setting for English. Regarding other languages, RNNs are
significantly better than the traditional methods on the similar task of named
entity recognition for Dutch (up to 22\% relative error reduction).

where information is modulated in the release timing of small information
particles, and decoded from the time of arrivals at the receiver. It is shown
that the random time of arrival can be represented as an additive noise
channel, and for the diffusion-based MT (DBMT) channel this noise is
distributed according to the L\'evy distribution. Lower and upper bounds on the
capacity of the DBMT channel are derived for the case where the delay
associated with the propagation of the information particles in the channel is
finite, namely, when the information particles dissipate after a finite time
interval. For the case where a single particle is released per channel use,
these bounds are shown to be tight. When the transmitter simultaneously
releases a large number of particles, the detector at the receiver may not be
able to precisely detect the arrival time of all the particles. Therefore, two
alternative models are considered: detection based on the particle that arrives
first, or detection based on the average arrival times. Tight lower and upper
bounds are derived for these two models. It is shown that by controlling the
maximal delay of the information particles, the capacity can increase
poly-logarithmically with the number of released particles. As each particle
takes a random independent path, this diversity of paths is analogous to
receiver diversity and can be used to considerably increase the achievable data
rates.

classified by means of purely combinatorial and geometric objects such as
Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams and indecomposable irreducible root systems, is
arguably one of the most elegant results in mathematics. The definition of the
root system is done by fixing a Cartan subalgebra of the given Lie algebra. The
remarkable fact is that (up to isomorphism) this construction is independent of
the choice of the Cartan subalgebra. The modern way of establishing this fact
is by showing that all Cartan subalgebras are conjugate.
  For symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebras, with the appropriate definition of
Cartan subalgebra, conjugacy has been established by Peterson and Kac. An
immediate consequence of this result is that the root systems and generalized
Cartan matrices are invariants of the Kac-Moody Lie algebras. The purpose of
this paper is to establish conjugacy of Cartan subalgebras for extended affine
Lie algebras; a natural class of Lie algebras that generalizes the
finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra and affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras.

support our society. However, their vulnerabilities have raised great concern
recently due to several large-scale blackouts around the world. In this paper,
we investigate the robustness of power systems against cascading failures
initiated by a random attack. This is done under a simple yet useful model
based on global and equal redistribution of load upon failures. We provide a
complete understanding of system robustness by i) deriving an expression for
the final system size as a function of the size of initial attacks; ii)
deriving the critical attack size after which system breaks down completely;
iii) showing that complete system breakdown takes place through a first-order
(i.e., discontinuous) transition in terms of the attack size; and iv)
establishing the optimal load-capacity distribution that maximizes robustness.
In particular, we show that robustness is maximized when the difference between
the capacity and initial load is the same for all lines; i.e., when all lines
have the same redundant space regardless of their initial load. This is in
contrast with the intuitive and commonly used setting where capacity of a line
is a fixed factor of its initial load.

new force that couples to muons, but not to electrons. An effective field
theory analysis using Non Relativistic Quantum Electrodynamics (NRQED)
indicates that the muonic hydrogen result can be interpreted as a large,
compared to some model estimates, muon-proton spin-independent contact
interaction. The muonic hydrogen result can be tested by a muon-proton
scattering experiment, MUSE, that is planned at the Paul Scherrer Institute in
Switzerland. The typical momenta of the muons in this experiment are of the
order of the muon mass. In this energy regime the muons are relativistic but
the protons are still non-relativistic. The interaction between the muons and
protons can be described by a hybrid QED-NRQED effective field theory. We
present some elements of this effective field theory. In particular we consider
${\cal O}(Z\alpha)$ scattering up to power $m^2/M^2$, where $m$ ($M$) is the

actually has resulted elusive. The problem with its absence may be related to
poor structural characteristics of the studied specimens, and/or to the
non-existence of this spike characteristic. Recent calculations have shown that
the fine structure indeed exists, but only for two dimensional approximants
phases. The aim of the present study is to show our recent experimental studies
with point contacts tunnel junction spectroscopy performed in samples of very
high quality. The studies were performed in icosahedral QC alloys with
composition Tb$_9$Mg$_{35}$Zn$_{56}$. We found the presence of a pseudogap
feature at the Fermi level, small as compared to the pseudogap of other
icosahedral materials. This study made in different spots on the QC shows quite
different spectroscopic features, where the observed DOS was a fine non-spiky
structure, distinct to theoretical predictions. In some regions of the
specimens the spectroscopic features could be related to Kondo characteristics
due to Tb magnetic atoms acting as impurities. Additionally, we observed that
the spectroscopic features vanished under magnetic field.

believed that the magnetorotational instability (MRI) generates turbulence

the field. The results show that the CRs randomly gain or lose their energies
through the interaction with the turbulent fields. The CRs diffuse in the
configuration space anisotropically: The diffusion coefficient in direction of
the unperturbed flow is about twenty times higher than the Bohm coefficient,
while those in the other directions are only a few times higher than the Bohm.
The momentum distribution is isotropic, and its evolution can be described by
the diffusion equation in momentum space where the diffusion coefficient is a
power-law function of the CR momentum. We show that the shear acceleration
efficiently works for energetic particles. We also cautiously note that in the
shearing box approximation, particles that cross the simulation box many times
along the radial direction suffer unphysical runaway acceleration by the
Lorentz transformation, which needs to be taken with special care.

negative correlation in 2007-2010 should be caused by the cessation of mass
loss from the Be star just before the decline in $V$-band brightness began
(around our 2007 observations). With the extension of the ejection material,
the largest circumstellar disk during the last two decades has been observed in
our 2010 observations with an equivalent width of $\sim$$-12.88$ \AA, which
corresponds to a circumstellar disk with a size of 12.9 times the radius of the

55444, and 55591 might be connected with the largest circumstellar disk around

constrain the structure of the circumstellar disk and estimate the eccentricity
of the binary system to be $\ge$ 0.4. After three years of the H$\alpha$

formed around the Be star after our 2013 observations.

computing this time is infeasible for large graphs. With this motivation, we
construct an absorbing Markov chain with a state for each degree of the graph,

there are graphs for which the proposed Markov model does and graphs for which
the model does not capture the absorbtion time, ii) there are graphs where
random sampling outperforms biased random walks, and graphs where biased random
walks are superior, and iii) the optimal bias parameter for the random walk is

still a controversial issue. In this work, we present multi-wavelength
observations of sympathetic eruptions, associated flares and coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) occurring on 2013 November 17 in two close-by active regions.
Two filaments i.e., F1 and F2 are observed in between the active regions.
Successive magnetic reconnections, caused by different reasons (flux
cancellation, shear and expansion) have been identified during the whole event.
The first reconnection occurred during the first eruption via flux cancellation
between the sheared arcades overlying filament F2, creating a flux rope and
leading to the first double ribbon solar flare. During this phase we observed
the eruption of overlaying arcades and coronal loops, which leads to the first
CME. The second reconnection is believed to occur between the expanding flux
rope of F2 and the overlying arcades of the filament F1. We suggest that this
reconnection destabilized the equilibrium of filament F1, which further
facilitated its eruption. The third stage of reconnection occurred in the wake
of the erupting filament F1 between the legs of overlying arcades. This may
create a flux rope and the second double ribbon flare and a second CME. The
fourth reconnection was between the expanding arcades of the erupting filament
F1 and the nearby ambient field, which produced the bi-directional plasma flows
towards both upward and downward. Observations and a nonlinear force-free field
extrapolation confirm the possibility of reconnection and the causal link
between the magnetic systems.

the minimal sampling tree analyses, we have extracted 13 stellar cores of 8 or
more members, which contains 60\% of the total YSOs. The typical core is
$\sim$0.6 pc in radii and somewhat elongated (aspect ratio of 1.45), of
relatively low stellar density (surface density 60 pc$^{-2}$), consisting of a
small (35) number of YSOs of relatively young sources (66\% Class I ), and
partially embedded (median $A_K$ =1.1 mag). But the cores show a wide range in
their mass distribution ($\sim$20 to 2400 M$_\odot$) with a median value of
around 130 M$_\odot$. We have found the star formation efficiencies in the

with the efficiencies needed to link the core mass function to the initial mass
function. We also found a linear relation between the density of the clouds and
the number of YSOs. The peaked nearest neighbor spacing distributions of the
YSOs and the ratio of Jeans lengths to the YSOs separations indicates a
significant degree of non-thermally driven fragmentation in these BRCs.

Networks Analysis field to extract such a network rely on an integration of
time, either over the whole considered period, or as a sequence of several
time-slices. However, they turn out to be inappropriate in the case of TV
series, due to the fact the scenes showed onscreen alternatively focus on
parallel storylines, and do not necessarily respect a traditional chronology.
This makes existing extraction methods inefficient to describe the dynamics of
relationships between characters, or to get a relevant instantaneous view of
the current social state in the plot. This is especially true for characters
shown as interacting with each other at some previous point in the plot but
temporarily neglected by the narrative. In this article, we introduce narrative
smoothing, a novel, still exploratory, network extraction method. It smooths
the relationship dynamics based on the plot properties, aiming at solving some
of the limitations present in the standard approaches. In order to assess our
method, we apply it to a new corpus of 3 popular TV series, and compare it to
both standard approaches. Our results are promising, showing narrative
smoothing leads to more relevant observations when it comes to the
characterization of the protagonists and their relationships. It could be used
as a basis for further modeling the intertwined storylines constituting TV
series plots.

  on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP 2016)",,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The thickness of a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices is the minimum number of
planar subgraphs of $G$ whose union is $G$. A polyline drawing of $G$ in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ is a drawing $\Gamma$ of $G$, where each vertex is mapped to a
point and each edge is mapped to a polygonal chain. Bend and layer complexities
are two important aesthetics of such a drawing. The bend complexity of $\Gamma$
is the maximum number of bends per edge in $\Gamma$, and the layer complexity
of $\Gamma$ is the minimum integer $r$ such that the set of polygonal chains in
$\Gamma$ can be partitioned into $r$ disjoint sets, where each set corresponds
to a planar polyline drawing. Let $G$ be a graph of thickness $t$. By
F\'{a}ry's theorem, if $t=1$, then $G$ can be drawn on a single layer with bend
complexity $0$. A few extensions to higher thickness are known, e.g., if $t=2$
(resp., $t>2$), then $G$ can be drawn on $t$ layers with bend complexity 2
(resp., $3n+O(1)$). However, allowing a higher number of layers may reduce the
bend complexity, e.g., complete graphs require $\Theta(n)$ layers to be drawn
using 0 bends per edge.
  In this paper we present an elegant extension of F\'{a}ry's theorem to draw
graphs of thickness $t>2$. We first prove that thickness-$t$ graphs can be
drawn on $t$ layers with $2.25n+O(1)$ bends per edge. We then develop another
technique to draw thickness-$t$ graphs on $t$ layers with bend complexity,
i.e., $O(\sqrt{2}^{t} \cdot n^{1-(1/\beta)})$, where $\beta = 2^{\lceil (t-2)/2
\rceil }$. Previously, the bend complexity was not known to be sublinear for
$t>2$. Finally, we show that graphs with linear arboricity $k$ can be drawn on
$k$ layers with bend complexity $\frac{3(k-1)n}{(4k-2)}$.

study by separately investigating the roles of substrate and polymer residues
on spin relaxation. First, the comparison between spin valves fabricated on
SiO2 and BN substrates suggests that substrate-related charged impurities,
phonons and roughness do not limit the spin transport in current devices. Next,
the observation of a 5-fold enhancement in spin relaxation time in the
encapsulated device highlights the significance of polymer residues on spin
relaxation. We observe a spin relaxation length of ~ 10 um in the encapsulated
bilayer with a charge mobility of 24000 cm2/Vs. The carrier density dependence
of spin relaxation time has two distinct regimes; n<4 x 1012 cm-2, where spin
relaxation time decreases monotonically as carrier concentration increases, and
n>4 x 1012 cm-2, where spin relaxation time exhibits a sudden increase. The
sudden increase in the spin relaxation time with no corresponding signature in
the charge transport suggests the presence of a magnetic resonance close to the
charge neutrality point. We also demonstrate, for the first time, spin
transport across bipolar p-n junctions in our dual-gated device architecture

temperatures, strong suppression of the spin signal was observed while a
transport gap was induced, which is interpreted as a novel manifestation of
impedance mismatch within the spin channel.

of minimizing a general quadratic objective function subject to a general

symmetric matrices in both the objective and constraint functions. By
exploiting the block separability of the canonical form, we show that all GTRSs

diagonalizability of the two matrices in the objective and constraint

as a semi-definite programming problem, our SOCP reformulation delivers a much
faster solution algorithm. We further extend our method to two variants of the
GTRS in which the inequality constraint is replaced by either an equality

simplified versions of the classical S-lemma, the S-lemma with equality, and
the S-lemma with interval bounds.

for low-energy electronic states is derived from the two-orbital Hubbard model
with a finite energy difference corresponding to the crystalline field
splitting. The effective model is represented by the spin operators and the
pseudo-spin operators for the spin-state degrees of freedom. The ground state
phase diagram is analyzed by the mean-field approximation. In addition to the
low-spin state and high-spin state phases, two kinds of the excitonic
insulating phases emerge as a consequence of the competition between the
crystalline field effect and the Hund coupling. The excitonic transition is
classified to be an Ising-like transition reflecting a spontaneous breaking of
the $Z_2$ symmetry. Magnetic structures in the two excitonic insulating phases
are different from each other; an antiferromagnetic order and a spin nematic
order. Collective excitations in each phase are examined by using the
generalized spin-wave method. The Goldstone modes in the excitonic insulating
phases appear in the dynamical correlation functions for the spins and
pseudo-spin operators. Both the transverse and longitudinal spin excitation
modes are active in the two excitonic insulating phases in contrast to the
low-spin state and high-spin state phases. Connections of the present results
to the perovskite cobalt oxides are discussed.

mass and radius with orbital periods below $2$--$4$ d. This cannot be explained
by observational biases because many Neptunian planets with longer orbital
periods have been detected. The existence of this desert is similar to the
appearance of the so-called brown-dwarf desert that suggests different
formation mechanisms of planets and stellar companions with short orbital
periods. Similarly, the Neptunian desert might indicate different mechanisms of
formation and evolution for hot Jupiters and short-period super-Earths. We here
follow a previous study and examine the location and shape of the desert in
both the period-mass and period-radius planes, using the currently available
large samples of planets. The desert in the period-mass plane has a relatively
sharp upper edge, with a planetary mass that is inversely proportional to the
planetary orbital period, while the lower, somewhat blurred, boundary is
located along masses that are apparently linearly proportional to the period.
The desert in the period-radius plane of the transiting planets is less clear.
It seems as if the radius along the upper boundary is inversely proportional to
the period to the power of one-third, while the lower boundary shows a radius
that is proportional to the period to the power of two-thirds. The combination
of the two upper bounds of the desert, in the period-mass and period-radius
planes, yields a planetary mass-radius relation of $R_{\rm p}/R_{\rm Jup}\simeq
(1.2\pm0.3)(M_{\rm p}/M_{\rm Jup})^{0.27\pm0.11}\,$ for $ 0.1\lesssim M_{\rm

up to periods of $5$--$10$ d, could shed some light on the formation and
evolution of close-in planets.

of novae in elliptical-like galaxies at the present epoch are characterized by
low mass white dwarfs (WDs), long decay times, relatively faint absolute

accumulation of somatic DNA changes, with respect to wildtype conditions.
Cancer and HIV are two common examples of such diseases, where the mutational
load in the cancerous/viral population increases over time. In these cases,
selective pressures are often observed along with competition, cooperation and
parasitism among distinct cellular clones. Recently, we presented a
mathematical framework to model these phenomena, based on a combination of
Bayesian inference and Suppes' theory of probabilistic causation, depicted in
graphical structures dubbed Suppes-Bayes Causal Networks (SBCNs). SBCNs are
generative probabilistic graphical models that recapitulate the potential
ordering of accumulation of such DNA changes during the progression of the
disease. Such models can be inferred from data by exploiting likelihood-based
model-selection strategies with regularization. In this paper we discuss the
theoretical foundations of our approach and we investigate in depth the
influence on the model-selection task of: (i) the poset based on Suppes' theory
and (ii) different regularization strategies. Furthermore, we provide an
example of application of our framework to HIV genetic data highlighting the

mitigation in multicell networks due to its ability to completely cancel the
intercell interference through linear precoding and receive filtering. In small
networks, the amount of required channel state information (CSI) is modest and
IA is therefore typically applied jointly over all base stations. In large
networks, where the channel coherence time is short in comparison to the time
needed to obtain the required CSI, base station clustering must be applied
however. We model such clustered multicell networks as a set of coalitions,
where CSI acquisition and IA precoding is performed independently within each
coalition. We develop a long-term throughput model which includes both CSI
acquisition overhead and the level of interference mitigation ability as a
function of the coalition structure. Given the throughput model, we formulate a
coalitional game where the involved base stations are the rational players.
Allowing for individual deviations by the players, we formulate a distributed
coalition formation algorithm with low complexity and low communication
overhead that leads to an individually stable coalition structure. The dynamic
clustering is performed using only long-term CSI, but we also provide a robust
short-term precoding algorithm which accounts for the intercoalition
interference when spectrum sharing is applied between coalitions. Numerical
simulations show that the distributed coalition formation is generally able to
reach long-term sum throughputs within 10 % of the global optimum.

energy definitions depend on the conditions one imposes on the boundary

propose a method to define and investigate systems in terms of their matter
plus gravitational energy content. We adopt a generic construction, that
involves embedding of an arbitrary dimensional world sheet into an arbitrary
dimensional spacetime, to a 2 + 2 picture. In our case, the closed
2-dimensional spacelike surface $\mathbb{S}$, that is orthogonal to the
2-dimensional timelike world sheet $\mathbb{T}$ at every point, encloses the
system in question. The integrability conditions of $\mathbb{T}$ and
$\mathbb{S}$ correspond to three null tetrad gauge conditions once we transform
our notation to the one of the null cone observables. We interpret the
Raychaudhuri equation of $\mathbb{T}$ as a work-energy relation for systems
that are not in equilibrium with their surroundings. We achieve this by
identifying the quasilocal charge densities corresponding to rotational and
nonrotational degrees of freedom, in addition to a relative work density
associated with tidal fields. We define the corresponding quasilocal charges
that appear in our work-energy relation and which can potentially be exchanged
with the surroundings. These charges and our tetrad conditions are invariant
under type-III Lorentz transformations, i.e., the boosting of the observers in
the directions orthogonal to $\mathbb{S}$. We apply our construction to a
radiating Vaidya spacetime, a $C$-metric and the interior of a Lanczos-van
Stockum dust metric. The delicate issues related to the axially symmetric
stationary spacetimes and possible extensions to the Kerr geometry are also

fast and easily applicable scoring function that works well for even
high-dimensional data. We demonstrate the favourable performance of our

stochastic evaluation of the cocoercive introduced in the first step. We prove
weak almost sure convergence of the iterates by showing that the primal-dual

through UV line-scattering. For OB stars with an orbiting circumstellar disk,
we explore the effect of such line-scattering in ablating disk material,
initially focusing on the marginally optically thin decretion disks of
classical Oe and Be stars. For this we apply a multi-dimensional
radiation-hydrodynamics code, assuming optically thin ray tracing for the
stellar continuum and a multi-ray Sobolev treatment of the line transfer. This
accounts for desaturation of line-absorption by Keplerian shear in the disk,
and associated driving by non-radial photons. Results show dense,
intermediate-speed surface ablation, consistent with the strong, blue-shifted
absorption seen in UV wind lines of Be shell stars. The asymptotic ablation
rate is typically an order-unity factor times the stellar wind mass loss rate,
leading to disk destruction times of order months to years for Be disks,
consistent with observations. The much stronger radiative forces of O stars
reduce this time to order days, making sustaining a disk difficult, and so
providing a natural explanation for the rarity of Galactic Oe stars.
Additionally, the weakened line-driving at lower metallicity implies both a
reduction in the winds that help spin-down stars from near-critical rotation,
and in the ablation of decretion disks, thus providing a natural explanation
for the higher fraction of Classical Be stars, and the presence of Oe stars, in
the Magellanic Clouds. We conclude with a discussion of future extensions to
study line-driven ablation of denser, optically thick, accretion disks around
pre-main-sequence massive stars.

solutions of gravitational theories and they evolve with time. Moreover, the
natural way of defining thermodynamic entities for the stationary ones is not

discussion within the Sultana-Dyer metric which is a cosmological black hole
solution of Einstein's gravity. In literature, there exists two expressions of
horizon temperature -- one is time dependent and the other does not depend on
time. To single out the correct one we find the temperature by studying the
Hawking effect in the tunnelling formalism. This leads to time dependent
structure. After identifying the correct one, the Einstein's equations are
written on the horizon and we show that this leads to the first law of
thermodynamics. In this process the expressions for horizon entropy and energy,
obtained earlier by explicit calculations, are being used. This provides the
evidence that Einstein's equations have thermodynamic structure even for a
cosmological black hole spacetime. Moreover, this study further clarifies the
correctness of the expressions for the thermodynamic quantities; like
temperature, entropy and internal energy.

as an exotic quasar at $z_{\rm em}=3.020$. In contrast to prominent broad
metal--line emissions with FWHM~9000 km/s, only a narrow Ly \alpha emission
line is present with FWHM~1000 km/s. The absence of broad Ly alpha emission
line has been a mystery for more than a decade. In this paper, we demonstrate
that this is due to dark Proximate Damped Ly alpha Absorption (PDLA) at $z_{\rm
abs}=3.010$ by identifying associated Lyman absorption line series from the
damped Ly beta up to Ly9, as well as the Lyman limit absorption edge. The PDLA
cloud has a column density of $\log N_{\rm H\,I}({\rm cm}^{-2})=21.8\pm0.2$, a
metallicity of [Zn/H]$>-1.0$, and a spatial extent exceeding the Narrow
Emission Line Region (NELR) of the quasar. With a luminosity of $L_{{\rm
Ly}\alpha}\sim10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the residual Ly alpha emission superposed
on the PDLA trough is of two orders of magnitude stronger than previous
reports. This is best explained as re-radiated photons arising from the quasar
outflowing gas at a scale larger than the NELR. The PDLA here, acting like a
natural coronagraph, provides us with a good insight into the illuminated gas
in the vicinity of the quasar, which are usually hard to resolve due to their
small size and ""seeing fuzz"" of bright quasars. Notably, SDSS J0952+0114
analogs might be easily omitted in the spectroscopic surveys of DLAs and PDLAs,
as their damped Ly alpha troughs can be fully filled by additional strong Ly
alpha emissions. Our preliminary survey shows that such systems are not very
rare. They are potentially a unique sample for probing strong quasar feedback
phenomena in the early universe.

explore optical absorption contrast based on nanosecond laser illumination. In
this paper, we report a long laser pulse induced dual photoacoustic (LDPA)
nonlinear effect, which originates from unsatisfied stress and thermal
confinements. Being different from conventional short laser pulse illumination,
the proposed method utilizes a long square-profile laser pulse to induce dual
photoacoustic signals. Without satisfying the stress confinement, the dual
photoacoustic signals are generated following the positive and negative edges
of the long laser pulse. More interestingly, the first expansion-induced
photoacoustic signal exhibits positive waveform due to the initial sharp rising
of temperature. On the contrary, the second contraction-induced photoacoustic
signal exhibits exactly negative waveform due to the falling of temperature, as
well as pulse-width-dependent signal amplitude which is caused by the
concurrent heat accumulation and thermal diffusion during the long laser
illumination. An analytical model is derived to describe the generation of the
dual photoacoustic pulses, incorporating Gruneisen saturation and thermal
diffusion effect, which is experimentally proved. Lastly, an alternate of LDPA
technique using quasi-CW laser excitation is also introduced and demonstrated
for both super-contrast in vitro and in vivo imaging. Compared with existing
nonlinear PA techniques, the proposed LDPA nonlinear effect could enable a much
broader range of potential applications.

(FH4) contributions to the effective potentials are built upon Ne-Ne and
Ne-coronene analytical potentials. In particular, a new corrected expression

weakly-interacting initially-double (C=C) bonds. The relevant total energies
are represented in the form of power series, wherein the averaged resonance
parameter of initially-single (C-C) bonds underlies the expansion. To
rationalize the resulting distinctions in total energies, interrelations are
sought between separate members of the series, on the one hand, and presence of
definite substructures in the given Kekule valence structure, on the other
hand. It is shown that monocycles S_1 and S_2 correspondingly containing two

[4]radialene) participate in the formation of energy corrections of the
relevant Kekule valence structures along with the usual conjugated circuits of

aim to discriminate between four different galaxy formation models based on two
accretion scenarios and two different star formation recipes. We address the
impact of a bimodal accretion scenario and a strongly regulated star formation
recipe. We present a new extension of the eGalICS model, which allows us to
track the metal enrichment process. Our new chemodynamical model is applicable
for situations ranging from metal-free primordial accretion to very enriched
interstellar gas contents. We use this new tool to predict the metallicity
evolution of both the stellar populations and gas phase. We also address the
evolution of the gas metallicity with the star formation rate (SFR). We then
focus on a sub-sample of Milky Way-like galaxies. We compare both the cosmic
stellar mass assembly and the metal enrichment process of such galaxies with
observations and detailed chemical evolution models. Our models, based on a
strong star formation regulation, allow us to reproduce well the stellar mass
to gas-phase metallicity relation observed in the local universe. However, we
observe a systematic shift towards high masses. Our $Mstar-Zg-SFR relation is
in good agreement with recent measurements: our best model predicts a clear
dependence with the SFR. Both SFR and metal enrichment histories of our Milky
Way-like galaxies are consistent with observational measurements and detailed
chemical evolution models. We finally show that Milky Way progenitors start
their evolution below the observed main sequence and progressively reach this

decays into a pair of the axions. We find that the mixings between the axion

branching ratio into two photons. The axion decay length can be suitable for
explaining the diphoton excess by the di-axion production when its decay
constant $f_a \simeq 1$ TeV. We also find that our model allows multiple sets

quantum stochastic systems with multichannel nondemolition measurements. The
system-observation dynamics are governed by a Markovian Hudson-Parthasarathy
quantum stochastic differential equation driven by quantum Wiener processes of
bosonic fields in vacuum state. The Hamiltonian and system-field coupling
operators, as functions of the system variables, are represented in a Weyl
quantization form. Using the Wigner-Moyal phase-space framework, we obtain a
stochastic integro-differential equation for the posterior quasi-characteristic
function (QCF) of the system conditioned on the measurements. This equation is
a spatial Fourier domain representation of the Belavkin-Kushner-Stratonovich
stochastic master equation driven by the innovation process associated with the
measurements. We also discuss a more specific form of the posterior QCF
dynamics in the case of linear system-field coupling and outline a Gaussian
approximation of the posterior quantum state.

fundamental plane (FP$_*$) using the early-type galaxy sample from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7).
  Methods. The FP$_*$ is calculated by replacing the luminosity in the
fundamental plane (FP) with stellar mass. Based on the SDSS group catalog, we
characterize the galaxy environment according to the mass of the host dark
matter halo and the position in the halo. In halos with the same mass bin, the
color distributions of central and satellite galaxies are different. Therefore,
we calculate FP$_*$ coefficients of galaxies in different environments and
compare them with those of the FP to study the contribution of the stellar
population.
  Results. We find that coefficient $a$ of the FP$_*$ is systematically larger
than that of the FP, but coefficient $b$ of the FP$_*$ is similar to the FP.
Moreover, the environmental dependence of the FP$_*$ is similar to that of the
FP. For central galaxies, FP$_*$ coefficients are significantly dependent on
the halo mass. For satellite galaxies, the correlation between FP$_*$
coefficients and the halo mass is weak.
  Conclusions. We conclude that the tilt of the FP is not primarily driven by
the stellar population.

photometric variability in the I-band, with amplitudes between 0.1-0.8 mag, The
spectra, however, remain remarkably constant, with spectral type changes less
than 0.5 subtypes. Thus, the brightness changes are not caused by veiling that
'fills in' absorption features. Three objects in the $\sigma$ Ori cluster (age
$\sim$3 Myr) exhibit strong H$\alpha$ emission and H$\alpha$ variability, in
addition to the continuum variations. Their behaviour is mostly consistent with
the presence of spots with temperature of $\sim300$ K above the photosphere and
filling factors between 0.2-0.4, in contrast to typical hot spots observed in
more massive stars. The remaining targets near $\epsilon$ Ori, likely to be
older, show eclipse-like lightcurves, no significant H$\alpha$ activity and are
better represented by variable extinction due to circumstellar material.
Interestingly, two of them show no evidence of infrared excess emission. Our
study shows that high-amplitude variability in young very low mass stars can be
caused by different phenomena than in more massive T Tauri stars and can
persist when the disk has disappeared and accretion has ceased.

multiple imputation. We show that three of the four approaches yield valid
inference, but that the performance of the methods varies with respect to the
number of imputed data sets and the extent of missingness. Simulation studies
reveal the behavior of our approaches in finite samples. A topical analysis
from HIV treatment research, which determines the optimal timing of
antiretroviral treatment initiation in young children, demonstrates the
practical implications of the four methods in a sophisticated and realistic
setting. This analysis suffers from missing data and uses the $g$-formula for
inference, a method for which no standard errors are available.

the state of the art Doppler precision and identified the critical path
challenges for reaching 10 cm/s measurement precision. The presentations and
discussion of key issues for instrumentation and data analysis and the workshop
recommendations for achieving this precision are summarized here.
  Beginning with the HARPS spectrograph, technological advances for precision
radial velocity measurements have focused on building extremely stable
instruments. To reach still higher precision, future spectrometers will need to
produce even higher fidelity spectra. This should be possible with improved
environmental control, greater stability in the illumination of the
spectrometer optics, better detectors, more precise wavelength calibration, and
broader bandwidth spectra. Key data analysis challenges for the precision
radial velocity community include distinguishing center of mass Keplerian
motion from photospheric velocities, and the proper treatment of telluric
contamination. Success here is coupled to the instrument design, but also
requires the implementation of robust statistical and modeling techniques.
Center of mass velocities produce Doppler shifts that affect every line
identically, while photospheric velocities produce line profile asymmetries
with wavelength and temporal dependencies that are different from Keplerian
signals.
  Exoplanets are an important subfield of astronomy and there has been an
impressive rate of discovery over the past two decades. Higher precision radial
velocity measurements are required to serve as a discovery technique for
potentially habitable worlds and to characterize detections from transit
missions. The future of exoplanet science has very different trajectories
depending on the precision that can ultimately be achieved with Doppler
measurements.

for solving practical optimization problems is their inability to encode even
moderately sized problems---the main reason for this being the rigid layout of
their quantum bits as well as their sparse connectivity. In particular, the
implementation of constraints has become a major bottleneck in the embedding of
practical problems, because the latter is typically achieved by adding harmful
penalty terms to the problem Hamiltonian --- a technique that often requires an
`all-to-all' connectivity between the qubits. Recently, a novel technique
designed to obviate the need for penalty terms was suggested; it is based on
the construction of driver Hamiltonians that commute with the constraints of
the problem, rendering the latter constants of motion. In this work we propose
general guidelines for the construction of such driver Hamiltonians given an
arbitrary set of constraints. We illustrate the broad applicability of our
method by analyzing several diverse examples, namely, graph isomorphism,
not-all-equal 3SAT, and the so-called Lechner, Hauke and Zoller constraints. We
also discuss the significance of our approach in the context of current and
future experimental quantum annealers.

useful model for virus capsids and colloidosomes. Indeed, icosahedral symmetry
observed in virus capsids corresponds to potential energy minima that occur for
magic numbers of, e.g., 12, 32 and 72 identical Lennard-Jones particles, for
which the packing has exactly the minimum number of twelve five-fold defects.
It is unclear, however, how stable these structures are against thermal
agitation. We investigate this property by means of basin-hopping global
optimisation and Langevin dynamics for particle numbers between ten and one
hundred. An important measure is the number and type of point defects, that is,
particles that do not have six nearest neighbours. We find that small
icosahedral structures are the most robust against thermal fluctuations,
exhibiting fewer excess defects and rearrangements for a wide temperature
range. Furthermore, we provide evidence that excess defects appearing at low
non-zero temperatures lower the potential energy at the expense of entropy. At
higher temperatures defects are, as expected, thermally excited and thus
entropically stabilised. If we replace the Lennard-Jones potential by a very
short-ranged (Morse) potential, which is arguably more appropriate for colloids
and virus capsid proteins, we find that the same particle numbers give a
minimum in the potential energy, although for larger particle numbers these
minima correspond to different packings. Furthermore, defects are more
difficult to excite thermally for the short-ranged potential, suggesting that
the short-ranged interaction further stabilises equilibrium structures.

sources of long gravitational waves prior to merging. These systems are good
candidates to be observed with forthcoming space-borne detectors. Only a few of
these systems, however, have been firmly identified to date.
  Aims. We aim at providing a criterion for the identification of some
supermassive black hole binaries based on the characteristics of the
high-energy emission of a putative relativistic jet launched from the most
massive of the two black holes.
  Methods. We study supermassive black hole binaries where the less massive
black hole has carved an annular gap in the circumbinary disk, but nevertheless
there is a steady mass flow across its orbit. Such a perturbed disk is hotter
and more luminous than a standard thin disk in some regions. Assuming that the
jet contains relativistic electrons, we calculate its broadband spectral energy
distribution focusing on the inverse Compton up-scattering of the disk photons.
We also compute the opacity to the gamma rays produced in the jet by photon
annihilation with the disk radiation and take into account the effects of the
anisotropy of the target photon field as seen from the jet.
  Results. We find that the excess of low-energy photons radiated by the
perturbed disk causes an increment in the external Compton emission from the
jet in the X-ray band, and a deep absorption feature at energies of tens of
TeVs for some sets of parameters. According to our results, observations with
Cherenkov telescopes might help in the identification of supermassive black
hole binaries, especially those black hole binaries that host primaries from
tens to hundreds of million of solar masses.

(mmWave) systems, where the base station (BS) and mobile stations (MSs) are
equipped with large antenna arrays to provide sufficient beamforming gain for
outdoor wireless communications. Hybrid analog and digital beamforming
structures are employed by both the BS and the MS due to hardware constraints.
We propose a layered pilot transmission scheme and a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)
decomposition-based method for joint estimation of the channels from multiple
users (i.e. MSs) to the BS. The proposed method exploits the sparse scattering
nature of the mmWave channel and the intrinsic multi-dimensional structure of
the multiway data collected from multiple modes. The uniqueness of the CP
decomposition is studied and sufficient conditions for essential uniqueness are
obtained. The conditions shed light on the design of the beamforming matrix,
the combining matrix and the pilot sequences, and meanwhile provide general
guidelines for choosing system parameters. Our analysis reveals that our
proposed method can achieve a substantial training overhead reduction by
employing the layered pilot transmission scheme. Simulation results show that
the proposed method presents a clear advantage over a compressed sensing-based
method in terms of both estimation accuracy and computational complexity.

not be closely related to each other, there can be distant (cryptic)
relationships that confound the evidence of disease association. These cryptic
relationships violate the GWAS assumption regarding the independence of the
subjects' genomes, and failure to account for these relationships results in
both false positives and false negatives.
  This paper presents a method to correct for these cryptic relationships. We
accurately detect distant relationships using an expectation maximization (EM)
algorithm for finding the identity coefficients from genotype data with know
prior knowledge of relationships. From the identity coefficients we compute the
kinship coefficients and employ a kinship-corrected association test.
  We assess the accuracy of our EM kinship estimation algorithm. We show that
on genomes simulated from a Wright-Fisher pedigree, our method converges
quickly and requires only a relatively small number of sites to be accurate. We
also demonstrate that our kinship coefficient estimates outperform
state-of-the-art covariance-based approaches and PLINK's kinship estimate.
  To assess the kinship-corrected association test, we simulated individuals
from deep pedigrees and drew one site to recessively determine the disease
status. We applied our EM algorithm to estimate the kinship coefficients and
ran a kinship-adjusted association test. Our approach compares favorably with
the state-of-the-art and far out-performs a na\""ive association test.
  We advocate use of our method to detect cryptic relationships and for
correcting association tests. Not only is our model easy to interpret due to
the use of identity states as latent variables, but also inference provides
state-of-the-art accuracy.

of ""subwavelength"" or ""sub-diffraction-limit"" focusing, which can be
principally broken down into three broad categories: (i) ""super-resolution"",
i.e. the technique based on the modification of the pupil of the optical system
to reduce the width of the central maximum in the intensity distribution at the
expense of increasing side bands; (ii) solid immersion lenses, making use of
metamaterials with a high effective index; (iii) concentration of intensity by
a subwavelength structure such as an antenna. Even though a lot of interesting

understanding of the fates of stellar systems. They are less luminous than
other supernova (SN) types and they evolve more rapidly to reveal nebular
spectra dominated by strong calcium lines with weak or absent signatures of
other intermediate- and iron-group elements, which are seen in other SNe.
Strikingly, their explosion sites also mark them out as distinct from other SN
types. Their galactocentric offset distribution is strongly skewed to very
large offsets (around one third are offset greater than 20 kpc), meaning they
do not trace the stellar light of their hosts. Many of the suggestions to
explain this extreme offset distribution have invoked the necessity for unusual
formation sites such as globular clusters or dwarf satellite galaxies, which
are therefore difficult to detect. Building on previous work attempting to
detect host systems of nearby Ca-rich SNe, we here present Hubble Space
Telescope imaging of 5 members of the class - 3 exhibiting large offsets and 2
coincident with the disk of their hosts. We find no underlying sources at the
explosion sites of any of our sample. Combining with previous work, the lack of
a host system now appears to be a ubiquitous feature amongst Ca-rich SNe. In
this case the offset distribution is most readily explained as a signature of
high-velocity progenitor systems that have travelled significant distances
before exploding.

distortion of some surface features, so too is it impossible to project the
behavior of light from the vacuum into a dielectric analog residing in
Minkowski space-time without introducing distortions. We study the covariance
properties of dielectric analog space-times and the kinematics of a congruence
of light in the analog, and show how certain features can be faithfully
emulated in the analog depending on the choice of projection, but that not all
features can be simultaneously emulated without distortion. These findings
indicate conceptual weaknesses in the idea of using analog space-times as a
basis for transformation optics, and we show that a certain formulation of
transformation optics closely related to analog space-times resolves these
issues.

Further, we investigated some algebraic operations of neutrosophic recommender

bold intersection, bounded difference, symmetric difference, convex linear sum
of min and max operators, Cartesian product, associativity, commutativity and
distributive. Based on these operations, we studied the algebraic structures
such as lattices, Kleen algebra, de Morgan algebra, Brouwerian algebra, BCK

of similarity measures based on these algebraic operations and studied some of
their theoretic properties. Moreover, we accomplished a prediction formula
using the proposed algebraic similarity measure. We also proposed a new

Finally to check the validity of the proposed methodology, we made experiments
on the datasets Heart, RHC, Breast cancer, Diabetes and DMD. At the end, we
presented the MSE and computational time by comparing the proposed algorithm
with the relevant ones such as ICSM, DSM, CARE, CFMD, as well as other variants

due to fact that many times, in the space and time variables we are dealing
which exhibit coarse-grained phenomena, meaning that infinitesimal quantities
cannot be placed arbitrarily to zero-rather they are non-zero with a minimum
length. Especially when we are dealing in microscopic to mesoscopic level of
systems. Meaning if we denote x the point in space and t as point in time; then
the differentials dx (and dt) cannot be taken to limit zero, rather it has
spread. A way to take this into account is to use infinitesimal quantities as
(\Deltax)^\alpha (and (\Deltat)^\alpha) with 0<\alpha<1, which for very-very
small \Deltax (and \Deltat); that is trending towards zero, these 'fractional'
differentials are greater that \Deltax (and \Deltat). That is
(\Deltax)^\alpha>\Deltax. This way defining the differentials-or rather
fractional differentials makes us to use fractional derivatives in the study of
dynamic systems. In fractional calculus the fractional order trigonometric
functions play important role. The Mittag-Leffler function which plays
important role in the field of fractional calculus; and the fractional order
trigonometric functions are defined using this Mittag-Leffler function. In this
paper we established the fractional order Schrodinger equation-composed via
Jumarie fractional derivative; and its solution in terms of Mittag-Leffler
function with complex arguments and derive some properties of the fractional
Schrodinger equation that are studied for the case of particle in one
dimensional infinite potential well.

applications such as depth measurements, detection of objects, and undersea
mapping. To cope with the long channel delay spread and the low signal-to-noise
ratio, hydroacoustic signals are constructed with a large time-bandwidth
product, $N$. A promising detector for hydroacoustic signals is the normalized
matched filter (NMF). For the NMF, the detection threshold depends only on $N$,
thereby obviating the need to estimate the characteristics of the sea ambient
noise which are time-varying and hard to estimate. While previous works
analyzed the characteristics of the normalized matched filter (NMF), for
hydroacoustic signals with large $N$ values the expressions available are
computationally complicated to evaluate. Specifically for hydroacoustic signals
of large $N$ values, this paper presents approximations for the probability
distribution of the NMF. These approximations are found extremely accurate in
numerical simulations. We also outline a computationally efficient method to
calculate the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) which is required to
determine the detection threshold. Results from an experiment conducted in the
Mediterranean sea at depth of 900~m agree with the analysis.
