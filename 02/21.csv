principles in a variety of contexts that share deep features. One way to help
students learn physics is via analogical reasoning. Students can be taught to
make an analogy between situations that are more familiar or easier to
understand and another situation where the same physics principle is involved
but that is more difficult to handle. Here, we examine introductory physics
students' ability to use analogies in solving problems involving Newton's
second law. Students enrolled in an algebra-based introductory physics course
were given a solved problem involving tension in a rope and were then asked to
solve another problem for which the physics is very similar but involved a
frictional force. They were asked to point out the similarities between the two
problems and then use the analogy to solve the friction problem.

scale wake structure is formed downstream of the Moon. However, recent in-situ
observations have revealed the presence of protons in the near-lunar wake (100
km to 200 km from the surface). The solar wind, either directly or after
interaction with the lunar surface (including magnetic anomalies), is the
source of these protons in the near-wake region. Using the entire data from the
SWIM sensor of the SARA experiment onboard Chandrayaan-1, we analysed the
velocity distribution of the protons observed in the near-lunar wake. The
average velocity distribution functions, computed in the solar wind rest frame,
were further separated based on the angle between the upstream solar wind
velocity and the IMF. Several proton populations were identified from the
velocity distribution and their possible entry mechanism were inferred based on
the characteristics of the velocity distribution. These entry mechanisms
include (i) diffusion of solar wind protons into the wake along IMF, (ii) the
solar wind protons with finite gyro-radii that are aided by the wake boundary
electric field, (iii) solar wind protons with gyro-radii larger than lunar
radii from the tail of the solar wind velocity distribution, and (iv)
scattering of solar wind protons from the dayside lunar surface or from
magnetic anomalies. In order to gain more insight into the entry mechanisms
associated with different populations, backtracing is carried out for each of
these populations. For most of the populations, the source of the protons
obtained from backtracing is found to be in agreement with that inferred from
the velocity distribution. There are few populations that could not be
explained by the known mechanisms and remain unknown.

description of isolated ions, as exact as possible, and treating their
(exchange) interaction at a later stage. We show that this standard approach
may break down in many cases, especially in $4d$ and $5d$ compounds. We argue
that there is an important intersite effect -- an orbital-selective formation
of covalent metal-metal bonds, which leads to an ""exclusion"" of corresponding
electrons from the magnetic subsystem, and thus strongly affects magnetic
properties of the system. This effect is especially prominent for noninteger
electron number, when it results in suppression of the famous double exchange,
the main mechanism of ferromagnetism in transition metal compounds. We study
this novel mechanism analytically and numerically and show that it explains
magnetic properties of not only several $4d-5d$ materials, including
Nb$_2$O$_2$F$_3$ and Ba$_5$AlIr$_2$O$_{11}$, but can also be operative in $3d$
transition metal oxides, e.g. in CrO$_2$ under pressure. We also discuss the
role of spin-orbit coupling on the competition between covalency and magnetism.
Our results demonstrate that strong intersite coupling may invalidate the
standard single-site starting point for considering magnetism, and can lead to
a qualitatively new behaviour.

well as the response time to a current step. Concerning the diffusion limited
current, a lower bound was derived from the concentration profile and an upper
bound was obtained from the limiting current of the semi-infinite case. The
lower bound, which is valid when Kirchhoff's current law applies to the unit

  Patterning against Complete Spatial Randomness","17 pages, 2 figures",,,,"stat.ML q-bio.QM stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We derive generalized estimators for a number of spatial statistics that have
been used in the analysis of spatially resolved omics data, such as Ripley's K,
H and L functions, clustering index, and degree of clustering, which allow
these statistics to be calculated on data modelled by arbitrary random measures
(RMs). Our estimators generalize those typically used to calculate these
statistics on point process data, allowing them to be calculated on RMs which
assign continuous values to spatial regions, for instance to model protein
intensity. The clustering index (H*) compares Ripley's H function calculated
empirically to its distribution under complete spatial randomness (CSR),
leading us to consider CSR null hypotheses for RMs which are not
point-processes when generalizing this statistic. We thus consider restricted
classes of completely random measures which can be simulated directly (Gamma
processes and Marked Poisson Processes), as well as the general class of all
CSR RMs, for which we derive an exact permutation-based H* estimator. We
establish several properties of the estimators, including bounds on the
accuracy of our general Ripley K estimator, its relationship to a previous
estimator for the cross-correlation measure, and the relationship of our
generalized H* estimator to previous statistics. To test the ability of our
approach to identify spatial patterning, we use Fluorescent In Situ
Hybridization (FISH) and Immunofluorescence (IF) data to probe for mRNA and
protein subcellular localization patterns respectively in polarizing mouse
fibroblasts on micropattened cells. We observe correlated patterns of
clustering over time for corresponding mRNAs and proteins, suggesting a
deterministic effect of mRNA localization on protein localization for several
pairs tested, including one case in which spatial patterning at the mRNA level
has not been previously demonstrated.

events (RSEs) present in the Web, such as e-mail conversations or Twitter
hashtags, is not trivial. Reports found in the literature reveal two apparent
conflicting visions of how RSEs should be modeled. From one side, the
Poissonian processes, of which consecutive events follow each other at a
relatively regular time and should not be correlated. On the other side, the
self-exciting processes, which are able to generate bursts of correlated events
and periods of inactivities. The existence of many and sometimes conflicting
approaches to model RSEs is a consequence of the unpredictability of the
aggregated dynamics of our individual and routine activities, which sometimes
show simple patterns, but sometimes results in irregular rising and falling
trends. In this paper we propose a highly parsimonious way to characterize
general RSEs, namely the Burstiness Scale (BuSca) model. BuSca views each RSE
as a mix of two independent process: a Poissonian and a self-exciting one. Here
we describe a fast method to extract the two parameters of BuSca that,
together, gives the burstyness scale, which represents how much of the RSE is
due to bursty and viral effects. We validated our method in eight diverse and
large datasets containing real random series of events seen in Twitter, Yelp,
e-mail conversations, Digg, and online forums. Results showed that, even using
only two parameters, BuSca is able to accurately describe RSEs seen in these
diverse systems, what can leverage many applications.

missing feature theory-based speech recognition system to recognize the speech
from simultaneous Japanese speakers in the context of a humanoid robot.
Recognition rates are presented for three simultaneous speakers located at 2
meters from the robot. The system was evaluated on a 200 word vocabulary at
different azimuths between sources, ranging from 10 to 90 degrees. Compared to
the use of the microphone array source separation alone, we demonstrate an
average reduction in relative recognition error rate of 24% with the
post-filter and of 42% when the missing features approach is combined with the
post-filter. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-source microphone
array post-filter and the improvement it provides when used in conjunction with
the missing features theory.

existing models of random motion in random media and admits a transparent
physical interpretation. More specifically, a random walk in a sparse random
environment can be characterized as a ""locally strong"" perturbation of a simple
random walk by a random potential induced by ""rare impurities,"" which are
randomly distributed over the integer lattice. Interestingly, in the critical
(recurrent) regime, our model generalizes Sinai's scaling of $(\log n)^2$ for
the location of the random walk after $n$ steps to $(\log n)^\alpha,$ where
$\alpha>0$ is a parameter determined by the distribution of the distance

sense of rotation. It then transforms from its normal form first to the
transient semicoiled state and subsequently to the curly-I state. The dynamics
of polymorphism is effectively modeled by describing flagellar elasticity
through an extended Kirchhoff free energy. However, the complete landscape of
the free energy remains undetermined because the ground state energies of the
polymorphic forms are not known. We investigate how variations in these ground
state energies affect the dynamics of a reversely rotated flagellum of a
swimming bacterium. We find that the flagellum exhibits a number of distinct
dynamical states and comprehensively summarize them in a state diagram. As a
result, we conclude that tuning the landscape of the extended Kirchhoff free
energy alone cannot generate the intermediate full-length semicoiled state.
However, our model suggests an ad hoc method to realize the sequence of
polymorphic states as observed for a real bacterium. Since the elastic
properties of bacterial flagella are similar, our findings can easily be
extended to other peritrichous bacteria.

optical wavefront by employing a transmissive spatial light modulator (SLM).
Conventionally, optical Airy beams are created by employing SLMs in the
so-called all phase mode. In the first method, a numerically simulated lens
phase distribution is loaded directly onto the SLM, together with the cubic
phase distribution. An Airy beam is generated at the focal plane of the
numerical lens. We provide for the first time a quantitative properties of the
formed Airy beam. We derive the formula for deflection of the intensity maximum
of the so formed Airy beam, which is different to the quadratic deflection
typical of Airy beams. We cross-validate the derived formula by both
simulations and experiment. The second method is based on the fact that a
system consisting of a transmissive SLM sandwiched between two polarisers can
create a transmission function with negative values. This observation alone has
the potential for various other wavefront modulations where the transmission
function requires negative values. As an example for this method, we
demonstrate that a wavefront can be modulated by passing the SLM system with
transmission function with negative values by loading an Airy function
distribution directly onto SLM. Since the Airy function is a real-valued
function but also with negative values, an Airy beam can be generated by direct
transfer of the Airy function distribution onto such an SLM system. In this
way, an Airy beam is generated immediately behind the SLM. As both new methods
do not employ a physical lens, the two setups are more compact than
conventional setups for creating Airy beams. We compare the performance of the
two novel methods and the properties of the created Airy beams.

provide a means of measuring an animal's activity in a meaningful and
quantitative way where direct observation is not possible. In sequential
acceleration data there is a natural dependence between observations of
movement or behaviour, a fact that has been largely ignored in most analyses.
Analyses of acceleration data where serial dependence has been explicitly
modelled have largely relied on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Depending on the
aim of an analysis, either a supervised or an unsupervised learning approach
can be applied. Under a supervised context, an HMM is trained to classify
unlabelled acceleration data into a finite set of pre-specified categories,
whereas we will demonstrate how an unsupervised learning approach can be used
to infer new aspects of animal behaviour. We will provide the details necessary
to implement and assess an HMM in both the supervised and unsupervised context,
and discuss the data requirements of each case. We outline two applications to
marine and aerial systems (sharks and eagles) taking the unsupervised approach,
which is more readily applicable to animal activity measured in the field. HMMs
were used to infer the effects of temporal, atmospheric and tidal inputs on
animal behaviour. Animal accelerometer data allow ecologists to identify
important correlates and drivers of animal activity (and hence behaviour). The
HMM framework is well suited to deal with the main features commonly observed
in accelerometer data. The ability to combine direct observations of animals
activity and combine it with statistical models which account for the features
of accelerometer data offer a new way to quantify animal behaviour, energetic
expenditure and deepen our insights into individual behaviour as a constituent
of populations and ecosystems.

interdependent computational steps. Such analytic pipelines often involve
different algorithms across multiple steps, each with its own hyperparameters.
To achieve the best performance, it is often critical to select optimal
algorithms and to set appropriate hyperparameters, which requires large
computational efforts. Bayesian optimization provides a principled way for
searching optimal hyperparameters for a single algorithm. However, many
challenges remain in solving pipeline optimization problems with
high-dimensional and highly conditional search space. In this work, we propose
Fast LineAr SearcH (FLASH), an efficient method for tuning analytic pipelines.
FLASH is a two-layer Bayesian optimization framework, which firstly uses a
parametric model to select promising algorithms, then computes a nonparametric
model to fine-tune hyperparameters of the promising algorithms. FLASH also
includes an effective caching algorithm which can further accelerate the search
process. Extensive experiments on a number of benchmark datasets have
demonstrated that FLASH significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods in both search speed and accuracy. Using 50% of the time budget, FLASH
achieves up to 20% improvement on test error rate compared to the baselines.
FLASH also yields state-of-the-art performance on a real-world application for
healthcare predictive modeling.

recombination rate of ionized gas substantially, affecting the growth of HII
regions during reionization. Previous attempts to quantify this effect
typically failed to resolve down to the Jeans scale in the pre-ionization IGM,
which is important in establishing this effect, along with the hydrodynamical
back-reaction of reionization on it. Towards that end, we perform a set of
fully-coupled, radiation-hydrodynamics simulations from cosmological initial
conditions, extending the mass resolution of previous work to the scale of
minihalos. Pre-reionization structure is evolved until a redshift $z_i$ at
which the ionizing radiation from external sources arrives to sweep an R-type
ionization front supersonically across the volume in a few Myr, until it is
trapped on the surfaces of minihalos and converted to D-type, after which the
minihalo gas is removed by photoevaporative winds. Small-scale density
structures during this time lead to a high ($>$10) clumping factor for ionized
gas, which hugely boosts the recombination rate until the structures are
disrupted by the hydrodynamic feedback after $\sim 10-100~\rm{Myr}$. For
incoming stellar radiation with intensity $J_{21}$ in a $200~h^{-1}~\rm{kpc}$
box with the mean density contrast $\bar\delta$, the number of extra
recombinations per H atom, on top of what is expected from homogeneously
distributed gas, is given by
$0.32[J_{21}]^{0.12}[(1+z_i)/11]^{-1.7}[1+\bar\delta]^{2.5}$. In models in
which most of the volume is ionized toward the end of reionization, this can
add more than one recombination per H atom to the ionizing photon budget to
achieve reionization.

distribution of accelerated particles between the two sources. In this context,

the cosmic-ray precursor and the hardness of the cosmic-ray energy

electric fields, magnetic fields, temperature gradients, concentration
gradients, etc., where each component, which is possibly anisotropic, may cross
couple the various fields with different fluxes, such as electrical currents,
electrical displacement currents, magnetic induction fields, energy fluxes,
particle fluxes, etc. We obtain the form of the perturbation expansions of the
fields and response tensor in powers of matrices which measure the difference
between each component tensor and a homogeneous reference tensor ${\bf L}_0$.
For the case of a statistically homogeneous or periodic composite the expansion
coefficients can be expressed in terms of positive semidefinite normalization
matrices alternating with positive semidefinite weight matrices, which at each
given level sum to the identity matrix. In an appropriate basis the projection
operators onto the relevant subspaces can be expressed in block tridiagonal
form, where the blocks are functions of these weight and normalization
matrices. This leads to continued fraction expansions for the effective tensor,
and by truncating the continued fraction at successive levels one obtains a
nested sequence of bounds on the effective tensor incorporating successively
more weight and normalization matrices. The weight matrices and normalization
matrices can be calculated from the series expansions of the fields which solve
the conductivity problem alone, without any couplings to other fields, and then
they can be used to obtain the solution for the fields and effective tensor in

spin linear response functions of a dilute superfluid Fermi gas in the BCS-BEC
crossover in both three and two dimensions. The derivation of the response
functions is based on the elegant functional path integral approach which
allows us to calculate the density-density and spin-spin correlation functions
by introducing the external sources for the density and the spin density. Since
the generating functional cannot be evaluated exactly, we consider two gapless
approximations which ensure a gapless collective mode (Goldstone mode) in the
superfluid state: the BCS-Leggett mean-field theory and the
Gaussian-pair-fluctuation (GPF) theory. In the mean-field theory, our results
of the response functions agree with the known results from the random phase
approximation. We further consider the pair fluctuation effects and establish a
theoretical framework for the dynamic responses within the GPF theory. We show
that the GPF response theory naturally recover three kinds of famous
diagrammatic contributions: the Self-Energy contribution, the Aslamazov-Lakin
contribution, and the Maki-Thompson contribution. We also show that unlike the
equilibrium state, in evaluating the response functions, the linear
(first-order) terms in the external sources as well as the induced order
parameter perturbations should be treated carefully. In the superfluid state,
there is an additional order parameter contribution which ensures that in the
static and long wavelength limit, the density response function recovers the
result of the compressibility (compressibility sum rule). We expect that the
$f$-sum rule is manifested by the full number equation which includes the

represents a significant problem in disease management and has socio-economic
implications. Development of genetic and molecular markers of clinically
significant disease in patients diagnosed with low grade localized PC would
have a major impact in disease management. A gene expression signature (GES) is
reported for lethal PC in biopsy specimens obtained at the time of diagnosis
from patients with Gleason 6 and Gleason 7 tumors in a Swedish watchful waiting
cohort with up to 30 years follow-up. A 98-genes GES identified 89 and 100
percent of all death events 4 years after diagnosis in G7 and G6 patients,
respectively; at 6 years follow-up, 83 and 100 percent of all deaths events
were captured. Remarkably, the 98-genes GES appears to perform successfully in
patients stratification with as little as 2% of cancer cells in a specimen,
strongly indicating that it captures a malignant field effect in prostates
harboring cancer cells of different degrees of aggressiveness. In G6 and G7
tumors from PC patients of age 65 or younger, GES identified 86 percent of all
death events during the entire follow-up period. In G6 and G7 tumors from PC
patients of age 70 or younger, GES identified 90 percent of all death events 6
years after diagnosis. Classification performance of the reported in this study
98-genes GES of lethal PC appeared suitable to meet design and feasibility
requirements of a prospective 4 to 6 years clinical trial, which is essential
for regulatory approval of diagnostic and prognostic tests in clinical setting.
Prospectively validated GES of lethal PC in biopsy specimens of G6 and G7
tumors will help physicians to identify, at the time of diagnosis, patients who
should be considered for exclusion from active surveillance programs and who
would most likely benefit from immediate curative interventions.

the stochastic block model literature to the case of uniform and non-uniform
hypergraphs. The present paper continues the same line of study, where we focus
on partitioning weighted uniform hypergraphs---a problem often encountered in
computer vision. This work is motivated by two issues that arise when a
hypergraph partitioning approach is used to tackle computer vision problems:
(i) The uniform hypergraphs constructed for higher-order learning contain all
edges, but most have negligible weights. Thus, the adjacency tensor is nearly
sparse, and yet, not binary. (ii) A more serious concern is that standard
partitioning algorithms need to compute all edge weights, which is
computationally expensive for hypergraphs. This is usually resolved in practice
by merging the clustering algorithm with a tensor sampling strategy---an
approach that is yet to be analysed rigorously. We build on our earlier work on
partitioning dense unweighted uniform hypergraphs (Ghoshdastidar and Dukkipati,
ICML, 2015), and address the aforementioned issues by proposing provable and
efficient partitioning algorithms. Our analysis justifies the empirical success
of practical sampling techniques. We also complement our theoretical findings

might be controllable over super-Planckian field ranges and therefore as
possible candidates for inflatons in large field inflation. Axion monodromy
scenarios are setups where the axion shift symmetry is broken by some effect
such that the axion can traverse a large number of periods potentially leading
to super-Planckian excursions. We study such scenarios in type IIA string
theory where the axion shift symmetry is broken by background fluxes. In
particular we calculate the backreaction of the energy density induced by the
axion vacuum expectation value on its own field space metric. We find universal
behaviour for all the compactifications studied where up to a certain critical
axion value there is only a small backreaction effect. Beyond the critical
value the backreaction is strong and implies that the proper field distance as
measured by the backreacted metric increases at best logarithmically with the
axion vev, thereby placing strong limitations on extending the field distance
any further. The critical axion value can be made arbitrarily large by the
choice of fluxes. However the backreaction of these fluxes on the axion field
space metric ensures a precise cancellation such that the proper field distance
up to the critical axion value is flux independent and remains sub-Planckian.
We also study an axion alignment scenario for type IIA compactifications on a
twisted torus with four fundamental axions mixing to leave an axion with an
effective decay constant which is flux dependent. There is a choice of fluxes
for which the alignment parameter is unconstrained by tadpoles and can in
principle lead to a parametrically enhanced effective decay constant. However
we show that these fluxes backreact on the fundamental decay constants so as to
precisely cancel any enhancement.

covariant description of nuclear dynamics based on light-front Hamiltonian
dynamics. The key quantity is the light-front spectral function, where both
normalization and momentum sum rule can be satisfied at the same time.
Preliminary results are discussed for an initial analysis of the role of
relativity in the EMC effect in 3He. A second issue, very challenging, is
considered in a non-relativistic framework, namely a distorted spin-dependent
spectral function for 3He in order to take care of the final state interaction
between the observed pion and the remnant in semi-inclusive deep inelastic
electron scattering off polarized 3He. The generalization of the analysis
within the light-front dynamics is outlined.

and one of the most fascinating and challenging problems of recent complex
network theory is to map a given network to its hyperbolic space. The
Popularity Similarity Optimization (PSO) model represents - at the moment - the
climax of this theory. It suggests that the trade-off between node popularity
and similarity is a mechanism to explain how complex network topologies emerge
- as discrete samples - from the continuous world of hyperbolic geometry. The
hyperbolic space seems appropriate to represent real complex networks. In fact,
it preserves many of their fundamental topological properties, and can be
exploited for real applications such as, among others, link prediction and
community detection. Here, we observe for the first time that a
topological-based machine learning class of algorithms - for nonlinear
unsupervised dimensionality reduction - can directly approximate the network's
node angular coordinates of the hyperbolic model into a two-dimensional space,
according to a similar topological organization that we named angular
coalescence. On the basis of this phenomenon, we propose a new class of
algorithms that offers fast and accurate coalescent embedding of networks in
the hyperbolic space even for graphs with thousands of nodes.

the burden of security officers in analyzing surveillance videos. Keywords or
attributes are generally chosen manually based on expert knowledge of
surveillance. Most existing works primarily aim at either supervised learning
approaches relying on extensive manual labelling or hierarchical probabilistic
models that assume the features are extracted using the bag-of-words approach;
thus limiting the utilization of the other features. To address this, we turn
our attention to automatic attribute discovery approaches. However, it is not
clear which automatic discovery approach can discover the most meaningful
attributes. Furthermore, little research has been done on how to compare and
choose the best automatic attribute discovery methods. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach, based on the shared structure exhibited amongst
meaningful attributes, that enables us to compare between different automatic
attribute discovery approaches.We then validate our approach by comparing
various attribute discovery methods such as PiCoDeS on two attribute datasets.
The evaluation shows that our approach is able to select the automatic
discovery approach that discovers the most meaningful attributes. We then
employ the best discovery approach to generate keywords for videos recorded
from a surveillance system. This work shows it is possible to massively reduce
the amount of manual work in generating video keywords without limiting
ourselves to a particular video feature descriptor.

that the late-time behavior of such correlators is determined by universal
properties of the rational conformal field theory such as the modular S-matrix
and conformal spins. Using the bulk-boundary correspondence between rational
conformal field theories and (2+1)-dimensional topologically ordered states, we
show that the late time behavior of out-of-time-order-correlators is
intrinsically connected with fractional statistics in the topological order. We
also propose a quantitative measure of chaos in a rational conformal field
theory, which turns out to be determined by the topological entanglement
entropy of the corresponding topological order.

EuFe$_{2}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$ by using Fourier-transform infrared
spectroscopy. In spite of the fact that Eu$^{2+}$ local moments order around
$T_\text{Eu} \approx 20$\,K, the overall optical response is strikingly similar
to the one of the well-known Ba-122 pnictides. The main difference lies within
the suppression of the lower spin-density-wave gap feature. By analysing our
spectra with a multi-component model, we find that the high-energy feature
around 0.7\,eV -- often associated with Hund's rule coupling -- is highly
sensitive to the spin-density-wave ordering, this further confirms its direct
relationship to the dynamics of itinerant carriers. The same model is also used
to investigate the in-plane anisotropy of magnetically detwinned
EuFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ in the antiferromagnetically ordered state, yielding a
higher Drude weight and lower scattering rate along the crystallographic
$a$-axis. Finally, we analyse the development of the room temperature spectra
with isovalent phosphor substitution and highlight changes in the scattering
rate of hole-like carriers induced by a Lifshitz transition.

viscosity in microcapillaries. Microvascular bifurcations have a significant
influence on the distribution of the blood cells and blood flow behavior. This
paper presents a simulation study performed on the two-dimensionalmotions and
deformation of multiple red blood cells in microvessels with diverging and
converging bifurcations. Fluid dynamics and membrane mechanics were
incorporated. Effects of cell shape, hematocrit, and deformability of the cell
membrane on rheological behavior of the red blood cells and the hemodynamics
have been investigated. It was shown that the blood entering the daughter
branch with a higher flow rate tended to receive disproportionally more cells.
The results also demonstrate that red blood cells in microvessels experienced
lateral migration in the parent channel and blunted velocity profiles in both
straight section and daughter branches, and this effect was influenced by the
shape and the initial position of the cells, the hematocrit, and the membrane
deformability. In addition, a cell free region around the tip of the confluence
was observed. The simulation results are qualitatively consistent with existing
experimental findings. This study may provide fundamental knowledge for a
better understanding of hemodynamic behavior of micro-scale blood flow.

  application of the concept to radiation",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Experiments involving single or few elementary particles are completely
described by Quantum Mechanics. Notwithstanding the success of that
quantitative description, various aspects of observations, as nonlocality and
the statistical randomness of results, remain as mysterious properties apart
from the quantum theory, and they are attributed to the strangeness of the
microscopic world. Here we restart from the fundamental relations of
uncertainty to reformulate the probability law of Born including the temporal
variable. Considering that both the spatial and the temporal variables play a
symmetric role in the wave-function \Psi (x,t) , a temporal wavepacket is built
and analysed. The probability density is written as p(x,t) = | \Psi (x,t) |^2,
where the probabilistic interpretation for the temporal wavepacket is
equivalent to Born's law for the spatial variable, x. For the convenience of
the discussion of the role of the temporal variable, we write p(x_0,t) = | \Psi
(x_0,t) |^2 for a free particle, expressing only the temporal wavepacket, then
we discuss its spread. In the light of the evolution of this temporal
wavepacket we analyse basic processes of matter-wave interaction, involving
single and entangled entities. Nonlocality appears then as a consequence of the
spread of the temporal wavepacket; and the position of each detected event in
two-slits interferometry as due to the independent phases of the spatial and
temporal wavepackets.

  a Batted Ball",,,,,"stat.AP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an algorithm for learning the intrinsic value of a batted ball in
baseball. This work addresses the fundamental problem of separating the value
of a batted ball at contact from factors such as the defense, weather, and
ballpark that can affect its observed outcome. The algorithm uses a Bayesian
model to construct a continuous mapping from a vector of batted ball parameters
to an intrinsic measure defined as the expected value of a linear weights
representation for run value. A kernel method is used to build nonparametric
estimates for the component probability density functions in Bayes theorem from
a set of over one hundred thousand batted ball measurements recorded by the
HITf/x system during the 2014 major league baseball (MLB) season.
Cross-validation is used to determine the optimal vector of smoothing
parameters for the density estimates. Properties of the mapping are visualized
by considering reduced-dimension subsets of the batted ball parameter space. We
use the mapping to derive statistics for intrinsic quality of contact for
batters and pitchers which have the potential to improve the accuracy of player
models and forecasting systems. We also show that the new approach leads to a
simple automated measure of contact-adjusted defense and provides insight into
the impact of environmental variables on batted balls.
