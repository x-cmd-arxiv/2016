  Thermodynamics to Understand the Jamming Phenomena","34 pages,15 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For the purpose of applying laws or principles originated from thermal
systems to granular athermal systems, we may need to properly define the
critical temperature concept in granular powders. The conventional
environmental temperature in thermal systems is too weak to drive movements of
particles in granular powders and cannot function as a thermal energy
indicator. For maintaining the same functionality as in thermal systems, the
temperature in granular powders is defined analogously and uniformly in this
article. The newly defined granular temperature is utilized to describe and
explain one of the most important phenomena observed in granular powders, the
jamming transition, by introducing jamming temperature and jamming volume
fraction concepts. The predictions from the equations of the jamming volume
fractions for several cases like granular powders under shear or vibration are
in line with experimental observations and empirical solutions in powder
handlings. The goal of this article is to establish similar concepts in
granular powders, allowing granular powders to be described with common laws or
principles we are familiar with in thermal systems. Our intention is to build a
bridge between thermal systems and granular powders to account for many
similarities already found between these two systems.

imaging. Its role is almost as important as the choice of a coronagraph or a
wavefront control system, and it is intertwined with the chosen observing
strategy. Among the data processing techniques for angular differential imaging
(ADI), the most recent is the family of principal component analysis (PCA)
based algorithms. PCA serves, in this case, as a subspace projection technique
for constructing a reference point spread function (PSF) that can be subtracted
from the science data for boosting the detectability of potential companions
present in the data. Unfortunately, when building this reference PSF from the
science data itself, PCA comes with certain limitations such as the sensitivity
of the lower dimensional orthogonal subspace to non-Gaussian noise. Inspired by
recent advances in machine learning algorithms such as robust PCA, we aim to
propose a localized subspace projection technique that surpasses current
PCA-based post-processing algorithms in terms of the detectability of
companions at near real-time speed, a quality that will be useful for future
direct imaging surveys. We used randomized low-rank approximation methods
recently proposed in the machine learning literature, coupled with entry-wise
thresholding to decompose an ADI image sequence locally into low-rank, sparse,
and Gaussian noise components (LLSG). This local three-term decomposition
separates the starlight and the associated speckle noise from the planetary
signal, which mostly remains in the sparse term. We tested the performance of
our new algorithm on a long ADI sequence obtained on beta Pictoris with
VLT/NACO. Compared to a standard PCA approach, LLSG decomposition reaches a
higher signal-to-noise ratio and has an overall better performance in the
receiver operating characteristic space. (abridged).

precisely how well JWST will perform and which of its myriad instruments and
observing modes will be best suited for transiting exoplanet studies. In this
article, we describe a prefatory JWST Early Release Science (ERS) program that
focuses on testing specific observing modes to quickly give the community the
data and experience it needs to plan more efficient and successful future
transiting exoplanet characterization programs. We propose a multi-pronged
approach wherein one aspect of the program focuses on observing transits of a
single target with all of the recommended observing modes to identify and
understand potential systematics, compare transmission spectra at overlapping
and neighboring wavelength regions, confirm throughputs, and determine overall
performances. In our search for transiting exoplanets that are well suited to
achieving these goals, we identify 12 objects (dubbed ""community targets"") that
meet our defined criteria. Currently, the most favorable target is WASP-62b
because of its large predicted signal size, relatively bright host star, and
location in JWST's continuous viewing zone. Since most of the community targets
do not have well-characterized atmospheres, we recommend initiating preparatory
observing programs to determine the presence of obscuring clouds/hazes within
their atmospheres. Measurable spectroscopic features are needed to establish
the optimal resolution and wavelength regions for exoplanet characterization.
Other initiatives from our proposed ERS program include testing the instrument
brightness limits and performing phase-curve observations.(Abridged)

of the evolution of such discs, focussing more on discs in young stellar
system, than on discs in active galactic nuclei. We consider the conditions
under which such discs may fragment to form bound objects, and when they might,
instead, be expected to settle into a quasi-steady, self-regulated state. We
also discuss how this understanding may depend on the mass of the disc relative
to the mass of the central object, and how it might depend on the presence of
external irradiation. Additionally, we consider whether or not fragmentation
might be stochastic, where we might expect it to occur in an actual
protostellar disc, and if there is any evidence for fragmentation actually
playing a role in the formation of planetary-mass bodies. Although there are
still a number of outstanding issue, such as the convergence of simulations of
self-gravitating discs, whether or not there is more than one mode of
fragmentation, and quite what role self-gravitating discs may play in the
planet formation process, our general understanding of these systems seems
quite robust.

by many celebrated approximation algorithms, commonly adopted in industrial
practice for large scale-search and learning. The resource bottleneck of the
algorithms is the computation of multiple (typically a few hundreds to
thousands) independent hashes of the data. The fastest hashing algorithm is by
Ioffe \cite{Proc:Ioffe_ICDM10}, which requires one pass over the entire data
vector, $O(d)$ ($d$ is the number of non-zeros), for computing one hash.
However, the requirement of multiple hashes demands hundreds or thousands
passes over the data. This is very costly for modern massive dataset.
  In this work, we break this expensive barrier and show an expected constant
amortized time algorithm which computes $k$ independent and unbiased WMH in
time $O(k)$ instead of $O(dk)$ required by Ioffe's method. Moreover, our
proposal only needs a few bits (5 - 9 bits) of storage per hash value compared
to around $64$ bits required by the state-of-art-methodologies. Experimental
evaluations, on real datasets, show that for computing 500 WMH, our proposal
can be 60000x faster than the Ioffe's method without losing any accuracy. Our
method is also around 100x faster than approximate heuristics capitalizing on
the efficient ""densified"" one permutation hashing schemes

significant advantages, we hope that it will replace existing implementations

total transmission power required to ensure that target
signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios at the receivers are met, subject to a
specified outage probability. We consider scenarios in which the errors in the
base station's channel estimates can be modelled as being zero-mean and
Gaussian. Such a model is particularly suitable for time division duplex (TDD)
systems with quasi-static channels, in which the base station estimates the
channel during the uplink phase. Under that model, we employ a precise
deterministic characterization of the outage probability to transform the
chance-constrained formulation to a deterministic one. Although that
deterministic formulation is not convex, we develop a coordinate descent
algorithm that can be shown to converge to a globally optimal solution when the
starting point is feasible. Insight into the structure of the deterministic
formulation yields approximations that result in coordinate update algorithms
with good performance and significantly lower computational cost. The proposed
algorithms provide better performance than existing robust power loading

even provide better performance than robust precoding algorithms based on such

density resembles the shape of a butterfly. Here, we report on the
photoassociation of butterfly Rydberg molecules and their orientation in a weak
electric field. Starting from a Bose-Einstein condensate of rubidium atoms, we
fully control the external degrees of freedom and spectroscopically resolve the
rotational structure and the emerging pendular states in an external electric
field. This not only allows us to extract the bond length, the dipole moment
and the angular momentum of the molecule but also to deterministically create
molecules with a tunable bond length and orientation. We anticipate direct
applications in quantum chemistry, many-body quantum physics and quantum
information processing.

analyzed together with the X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton, Suzaku and RXTE.
These broad-band data were fitted with a model assuming a thermal
Comptonization as a primary continuum component. We tested several model
options through a fitting of the Comptonized continuum accompanied by a complex
absorption and a Compton reflection. Both the large data set used and the model
space explored allowed us to accurately determine a mean temperature kTe of the
electron plasma, the Compton parameter y and the Compton reflection strength R
for the majority of objects in the sample. Our main finding is that a vast
majority of the sample (20 objects) is characterized by kTe < 100 keV, and only
for two objects we found kTe > 200 keV. The median kTe for entire sample is
48(-14,+57) keV. The distribution of the y parameter is bimodal, with a broad
component centered at ~0.8 and a narrow peak at ~1.1. A complex, dual absorber
model improved the fit for all data sets, compared to a simple absorption
model, reducing the fitted strength of Compton reflection by a factor of about
2. Modest reflection (median R ~0.32) together with a high ratio of Comptonized
to seed photon fluxes point towards a geometry with a compact hard X-ray
emitting region well separated from the accretion disc. Our results imply that
the template Seyferts spectra used in AGN population synthesis models should be
revised.

different to what is normally done in a weakly supervised setting. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 show that (1) using human verification to update
detectors and reduce the search space leads to the rapid production of
high-quality bounding-box annotations; (2) our scheme delivers detectors
performing almost as good as those trained in a fully supervised setting,
without ever drawing any bounding-box; (3) as the verification task is very

initial chiral asymmetry in the symmetric phase at temperatures higher than the
transition temperature, as well as the existence of magnetic fields, it is
demonstrated that the asymmetry typically grows with time, until it undergoes a
fast decrease at the transition, and then eventually gets damped at lower
temperatures in the broken phase. We argue that it is unlikely to have any
significant magnetic field amplification as a consequence of the electroweak
transition in the Standard model, even when the chiral anomaly is introduced.
The presence of a chiral asymmetry between left- and right-handed charge
carriers naturally leads to the creation of helical magnetic fields from

health-related messages as they arrive. We employ a hybrid approach, which
combines human and machine intelligence that seeks to resolve the information
overload issue by introducing processing of large-scale data at high-speed
while maintaining a high classification accuracy. The system has recently been
tested in conjunction with UNICEF in Zambia to classify short messages received
via the U-Report platform on various health related issues. The system is

of an optical cavity leads to quantum phases of matter, which at the same time
posses properties of systems with both short- and long-range interactions. This
opens perspectives for novel quantum simulators of finite-range interacting
systems, even though the light-induced interaction is global (i.e. infinitely
long range). This is achieved by spatial structuring of the global light-matter
coupling at a microscopic scale. Such simulators can directly benefit from the
collective enhancement of the global light-matter interaction and constitute an
alternative to standard approaches using Rydberg atoms or polar molecules. The
system in the steady state of light induces effective many-body interactions
that change the landscape of the phase diagram of the typical Bose-Hubbard
model. Therefore, the system can support non-trivial superfluid states, bosonic
dimer, trimers, etc. states and supersolid phases depending on the choice of
the wavelength and pattern of the light with respect to the classical optical
lattice potential. We find that by carefully choosing the system parameters one
can investigate diverse strongly correlated physics with the same setup, i.e.,
modifying the geometry of light beams. In particular, we present the interplay
between the density and bond (or matter-wave coherence) interactions. We show
how to tune the effective interaction length in such a hybrid system with both
short-range and global interactions.

plays an important role in medical image analysis, e.g. in anatomy
reconstruction from tomographic measurements or in the process of aligning
intra-operative navigation and preoperative planning data. In such scenarios,
one usually has to deal with sparse data, which significantly aggravates the
problem of reconstruction. However, medical applications often provide
contextual information about the 3D point data that allow to incorporate prior
knowledge about the shape that is to be reconstructed. To this end, we propose
the use of a statistical shape model (SSM) as a prior for surface
reconstruction. The SSM is represented by a point distribution model (PDM),
which is associated with a surface mesh. Using the shape distribution that is
modelled by the PDM, we formulate the problem of surface reconstruction from a
probabilistic perspective based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). In order to
do so, the given points are interpreted as samples of the GMM. By using mixture
components with anisotropic covariances that are ""oriented"" according to the
surface normals at the PDM points, a surface-based fitting is accomplished.
Estimating the parameters of the GMM in a maximum a posteriori manner yields
the reconstruction of the surface from the given data points. We compare our
method to the extensively used Iterative Closest Points method on several
different anatomical datasets/SSMs (brain, femur, tibia, hip, liver) and
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness on sparse data.

of the matter power spectrum below the neutrino free streaming scale: massive
neutrinos erase power at these scales. Detection of a lack of small-scale
power, however, could also be due to a host of other effects. It is therefore
of paramount importance to validate neutrinos as the source of power
suppression at small scales. We show that, independent on hierarchy, neutrinos
always show a footprint on large, linear scales; the exact location and
properties can be related to the measured power suppression (an astrophysical
measurement) and atmospheric neutrinos mass splitting (a neutrino oscillation
experiment measurement). This feature can not be easily mimicked by systematic
uncertainties or modifications in the cosmological model. The measurement of
such a feature, up to 1% relative change in the power spectrum, is a smoking

and that the host candidate, WISE J071634.59-190039.2, is instead a radio
variable: the available data did not exclude this possibility; a random radio
variable consistent with the observations is not unlikely to have a redshift
compatible with the FRB dispersion measure; and the proposed transient light
curve is better explained as a scintillating steady source, perhaps also
showing an active galactic nucleus (AGN) flare, than a synchrotron-emitting
blastwave. The radio luminosity of the host candidate implies that it is an AGN
and we present new late-time Very Large Array observations showing that the
galaxy is indeed variable at a level consistent with the claimed transient.

(JT) can improve the overall system performance. In this paper, from the load
balancing perspective, we study how the maximum load can be reduced by
optimizing JT pattern that characterizes the association between cells and User
Equipments (UEs). To give a model of the interference caused by cells with
different time-frequency resource usage, we extend a load coupling model, by
taking into account JT. In this model, the mutual interference depends on the
load of cells coupled in a non-linear system with each other. Under this model,
we study a two-cell case and proved that the optimality is achieved in linear
time in the number of UEs. After showing the complexity of load balancing in
the general network scenario, an iterative algorithm for minimizing the maximum
load, named JT-MinMax, is proposed. We evaluate JT-MinMax in a Heterogeneous
Network (HetNet), though it is not limited to this type of scenarios. Numerical
results demonstrate the significant performance improvement of JT-MinMax on
min-max cell load, compared to the conventional non-JT solution where each UE
is served by the cell with best received transmit signal.

for identifying the best among a finite set of options or designs. An
experimenter sequentially chooses designs to measure and observes noisy signals
of their quality with the goal of confidently identifying the best design after
a small number of measurements. This paper proposes three simple and intuitive
Bayesian algorithms for adaptively allocating measurement effort, and
formalizes a sense in which these seemingly naive rules are the best possible.
One proposal is top-two probability sampling, which computes the two designs
with the highest posterior probability of being optimal, and then randomizes to
select among these two. One is a variant of top-two sampling which considers
not only the probability a design is optimal, but the expected amount by which
its quality exceeds that of other designs. The final algorithm is a modified
version of Thompson sampling that is tailored for identifying the best design.
We prove that these simple algorithms satisfy a sharp optimality property. In a
frequentist setting where the true quality of the designs is fixed, one hopes
the posterior definitively identifies the optimal design, in the sense that
that the posterior probability assigned to the event that some other design is
optimal converges to zero as measurements are collected. We show that under the
proposed algorithms this convergence occurs at an exponential rate, and the
corresponding exponent is the best possible among all allocation

Concretely, the movement pattern of a group of node(s) can be extracted from

the relay node(s) set and the destination node is obtained, by which we can
further evaluate the co-delivery probability of the relay node(s) set. Both

designed for implementing the under-controlled replication strategy. To reduce

nitrogen oxides. It has been suggested that some such events are visible as
layers of nitrate in ice cores, yielding archives of energetic, high fluence
solar proton events (SPEs). There has been controversy, due to slowness of
transport for these species down from the upper stratosphere; past numerical
simulations based on an analytic calculation have shown very little ionization
below the mid stratosphere. These simulations suffer from deficiencies: they
consider only soft SPEs and narrow energy ranges; spectral fits are poorly
chosen; with few exceptions secondary particles in air showers are ignored.
Using improved simulations that follow development of the proton-induced air
shower, we find consistency with recent experiments showing substantial excess
ionization down to 5 km. We compute nitrate available from the 23 February 1956
SPE, which had a high fluence, hard spectrum, and well-resolved associated
nitrate peak in a Greenland ice core. For the first time, we find this event
can account for ice core data with timely (~ 2 months) transport downward
between 46 km and the surface, thus indicating an archive of high fluence, hard
spectrum SPE covering the last several millennia. We discuss interpretations of
this result, as well as the lack of a clearly-defined nitrate spike associated
with the soft-spectrum 3-4 August 1972 SPE. We suggest that hard-spectrum SPEs,
especially in the 6 months of polar winter, are detectable in ice cores, and
that more work needs to be done to investigate this.

The reason for this limit is well understood in terms of separation of the

and fast degrees of freedom. The fast degrees of freedom are introduced as the
variation of the angular momentum responsible for the inertia. In order to
study the effect of the fast degrees of freedom on the precession, we calculate

developed by Kolb and Letzter. We introduce a class of generalized Satake
diagrams that give rise to (not necessarily involutive) automorphisms of the
second kind of symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras $\mathfrak{g}$. These lead to
right coideal subalgebras $B_{\mathbf{c},\mathbf{s}}$ of quantized enveloping
algebras $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$. In the case that $\mathfrak{g}$ is a twisted or
untwisted affine Lie algebra of classical type Jimbo found intertwiners
(equivariant maps) of the vector representation of $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ yielding
trigonometric solutions to the parameter-dependent quantum Yang-Baxter
equation. In the present paper we compute intertwiners of the vector
representation restricted to the subalgebras $B_{\mathbf{c},\mathbf{s}}$ when
$\mathfrak{g}$ is of type ${\rm A}^{(1)}_n$, ${\rm B}^{(1)}_n$, ${\rm
C}^{(1)}_n$ and ${\rm D}^{(1)}_n$. These intertwiners are matrix solutions to
the parameter-dependent quantum reflection equation known as trigonometric
reflection matrices. They are symmetric up to conjugation by a diagonal matrix
and in many cases satisfy a certain sparseness condition: there are at most two
nonzero entries in each row and column. Conjecturally, this classifies all such
solutions in vector spaces carrying this representation. A group of Hopf
algebra automorphisms of $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ acts on these reflection matrices,
allowing us to show that each reflection matrix found is equivalent to one with
at most two additional free parameters. Additional characteristics of the
reflection matrices such as eigendecompositions and affinization relations are
also obtained. The eigendecompositions suggest that for all these matrices
there should be a natural interpretation in terms of representations of
Hecke-type algebras.

the problem of secure outsourcing of exponentiation operations to one single

number of modular multiplications at local mobile environment thus it can
achieve impressive computational gain. ExpSOS also provides a secure
verification scheme with probability approximately 1 to ensure that the mobile
end-users can always receive valid results. The comprehensive analysis as well
as the simulation results in real mobile device demonstrates that our proposed
ExpSOS can significantly improve the existing schemes in efficiency, security
and result verifiability. We apply ExpSOS to securely outsource several

that the enhancement in pair-pair correlations is not related to

manifests itself as a charge-ordered state in other charge-transfer solids.
Long-range superconducting order does not appear to be present in the purely

foundations of large-scale graph computations, we study some fundamental graph
problems in a message-passing model for distributed computing where $k \geq 2$
machines jointly perform computations on graphs with $n$ nodes (typically, $n
\gg k$). The input graph is assumed to be initially randomly partitioned among
the $k$ machines, a common implementation in many real-world systems.
Communication is point-to-point, and the goal is to minimize the number of
communication {\em rounds} of the computation.
  Our main contribution is the {\em General Lower Bound Theorem}, a theorem
that can be used to show non-trivial lower bounds on the round complexity of
distributed large-scale data computations. The General Lower Bound Theorem is
established via an information-theoretic approach that relates the round
complexity to the minimal amount of information required by machines to solve
the problem. Our approach is generic and this theorem can be used in a
""cookbook"" fashion to show distributed lower bounds in the context of several
problems, including non-graph problems. We present two applications by showing
(almost) tight lower bounds for the round complexity of two fundamental graph
problems, namely {\em PageRank computation} and {\em triangle enumeration}. Our
approach, as demonstrated in the case of PageRank, can yield tight lower bounds
for problems (including, and especially, under a stochastic partition of the
input) where communication complexity techniques are not obvious.
  Our approach, as demonstrated in the case of triangle enumeration, can yield
stronger round lower bounds as well as message-round tradeoffs compared to
approaches that use communication complexity techniques.

observed on both sides (immediate upstream and downstream) of the EDR, leading

plus Hubbard $U$ (DFT+$U$) calculations. Trigonal prismatic VS$_2$ has an
isolated low-energy band that emerges from a confluence of crystal field
splitting and direct V--V hopping. Within spin density functional theory,
ferromagnetism splits the isolated band of the trigonal prismatic structure,
leading to a low-band-gap $S=1/2$ ferromagnetic Stoner insulator; the
octahedral phase is higher in energy. Including the on-site interaction $U$
increases the band gap, leads to Mott insulating behavior, and for sufficiently
high values stabilizes the ferromagnetic octahedral phase. The validity of DFT
and DFT+$U$ for these two-dimensional materials with potential for strong
electronic correlations is discussed. A clear benchmark is given by examining
the experimentally observed charge density wave (CDW) in octahedral VS$_2$, for
which DFT grossly overestimates the bond length differences compared to known
experiments; the presence of CDWs is also probed for the trigonal prismatic

materials, we present new theory for the emergence of plant structure at a
range of scales dictated by levels of ionization (charge density), which can be
traced directly back to proteins transcribed from genetic code and their
interaction with external sources of charge (such as CO2) in real plants.
Beyond a critical percolation threshold, individual charge induced quantum
poten- tials (driven by dissipative systems) merge to form a complex,
interconnected geometric web, creating macroscopic quantum potentials, which
lead to the emergence of macroscopic quantum processes. The assembly of
molecules into larger, ordered structures operates within these charge-induced
coherent bosonic fields, acting as a structuring force in competition with
exterior potentials. Within these processes many of the phenomena associated
with standard quantum theory are recovered, including quantization,
non-dissipation, self-organization, confinement, structuration conditioned by
the environment, environmental fluctuations leading to macroscopic quantum
decoherence and evolutionary time described by a time dependent
Schrodinger-like equation, which describes models of bifurcation and
duplication. The work provides a strong case for the existence of
quintessence-like behaviour, with macroscopic quantum potentials and associated
forces having their equivalence in standard quantum mechanics and gravitational
forces in general relativity. The theory offers new insight into evolutionary
processes in structural biology, with selection at any point in time, being
made from a wide range of spontaneously emerging potential structures
(dependent on conditions), which offer advantage for a specific organism. This
is valid for both the emergence of structures from a prebiotic medium and the
wide range of different plant structures we see today.

Abell 611. We perform a strong lensing analysis of the cluster core and use
velocity dispersion measurements for individual cluster members as additional
constraints. Despite the small number of multiply-imaged systems and cluster
members with central velocity dispersions available in the core of A611, the
addition of velocity dispersion measurements leads to tighter constraints on
the mass associated with the galaxy component, and as a result, on the mass
associated with the dark matter halo. Without the spectroscopic velocity
dispersions, we would overestimate the mass of the galaxy component by a factor
of $\sim1.5$, or, equivalently, we would underestimate the mass of the cluster
dark halo by $\sim5\%$. We perform an additional lensing analysis using surface
brightness (SB) reconstruction of the tangential giant arc. This approach
improves the constraints on the mass parameters of the 5 galaxies close to the
arc by up to a factor $\sim10$. The galaxy velocity dispersions resulting from
the SB analysis are consistent at the 1$\sigma$ confidence level with the
spectroscopic measurements and with the prediction from the simple pointlike
analysis. In contrast the truncation radii for 2-3 galaxies depart
significantly from the galaxy scaling relation and suggest differences in the
stripping history from galaxy to galaxy.

the name GW150914, is described in detail elsewhere. By prior arrangement,
preliminary estimates of the time, significance, and sky location of the event
were shared with 63 teams of observers covering radio, optical, near-infrared,
X-ray, and gamma-ray wavelengths with ground- and space-based facilities. In
this Letter we describe the low-latency analysis of the GW data and present the
sky localization of the first observed compact binary merger. We summarize the
follow-up observations reported by 25 teams via private Gamma-ray Coordinates
Network circulars, giving an overview of the participating facilities, the GW
sky localization coverage, the timeline and depth of the observations. As this
event turned out to be a binary black hole merger, there is little expectation
of a detectable electromagnetic (EM) signature. Nevertheless, this first
broadband campaign to search for a counterpart of an Advanced LIGO source
represents a milestone and highlights the broad capabilities of the transient
astronomy community and the observing strategies that have been developed to
pursue neutron star binary merger events. Detailed investigations of the EM
data and results of the EM follow-up campaign are being disseminated in papers
by the individual teams.

of free field theories and studies of conical defects, fails holographically.

remnant shocks that propagate in the interstellar medium up to the densest
parts of molecular clouds, losing energy and their ionisation efficiency
because of the presence of magnetic fields and collisions with molecular
hydrogen. Recent observations hint at high levels of ionisation and at the
presence of synchrotron emission in protostellar systems, which leads to an
apparent contradiction. We want to explain the origin of these CRs accelerated
within young protostars as suggested by observations. Our modelling consists of
a set of conditions that has to be satisfied in order to have an efficient CR
acceleration through diffusive shock acceleration. We analyse three main
acceleration sites, then we follow the propagation of these particles through
the protostellar system up to the hot spot region. We find that jet shocks can
be strong accelerators of CR protons, which can be boosted up to relativistic
energies. Other promising acceleration sites are protostellar surfaces, where
shocks caused by impacting material during the collapse phase are strong enough
to accelerate CR protons. In contrast, accretion flow shocks are too weak to
efficiently accelerate CRs. Though CR electrons are weakly accelerated, they
can gain a strong boost to relativistic energies through re-acceleration in
successive shocks. We suggest a mechanism able to accelerate both CR protons
and electrons through the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism, which can be
used to explain the high ionisation rate and the synchrotron emission observed
towards protostellar sources. The existence of an internal source of energetic
particles can have a strong and unforeseen impact on the ionisation of the
protostellar disc, on the star and planet formation processes, and on the
formation of pre-biotic molecules.

the orbital alignment of Kuiper Belt objects, and other Solar System
properties, which suggest a Neptune-mass object on an eccentric orbit with
semimajor axis $a_9\approx400-1500$ AU. With such a wide orbit, Planet Nine has
a large interaction cross section, and is susceptible to disruption by passing
stars. Using a large ensemble of numerical simulations (several million), and
Monte Carlo sampling, we calculate the cross sections for different classes of
orbit-altering events: [A] scattering the planet into its proposed orbit from a
smaller orbit, [B] ejecting it from the Solar System from its current orbit,
[C] capturing the planet from another system, and [D] capturing a free-floating
planet. Results are presented for a range of orbital elements with planetary
mass $m_9=10M_{earth}$. Removing Planet Nine from the Solar System is the most
likely outcome. Specifically, we obtain ejection cross sections
$\sigma_{int}\sim5\times10^6$ AU$^2$ ($5\times10^4$ AU$^2$) for environments
corresponding to the birth cluster (field). With these cross sections, Planet
Nine is likely to be ejected if the Sun resides within its birth cluster longer
than $\Delta{t} \gtrsim 100$ Myr. The probability of ejecting Planet Nine due
to passing field stars is $\lesssim 3\%$ over the age of the Sun. Probabilities
for producing the inferred Planet Nine orbit are low $(\lesssim 5\%)$.

determination method based on Self Organizing Maps and Bayesian Inference
(SOMBI). SOMBI aims to automatically identify relations between different
observed parameters in unstructured cosmological or astrophysical surveys by
automatically identifying data clusters in high-dimensional datasets via the
Self Organizing Map neural network algorithm. Parameter relations are then
revealed by means of a Bayesian inference within respective identified data
clusters. Specifically such relations are assumed to be parametrized as a
polynomial of unknown order. The Bayesian approach results in a posterior
probability distribution function for respective polynomial coefficients. To
decide which polynomial order suffices to describe correlation structures in
data, we include a method for model selection, the Bayesian Information
Criterion, to the analysis. The performance of the SOMBI algorithm is tested
with mock data. As illustration we also provide applications of our method to
cosmological data. In particular, we present results of a correlation analysis
between galaxy and AGN properties provided by the SDSS catalog with the cosmic
large-scale-structure (LSS). The results indicate that the combined galaxy and
LSS dataset indeed is clustered into several sub-samples of data with different
average properties (for example different stellar masses or web-type
classifications). The majority of data clusters appear to have a similar
correlation structure between galaxy properties and the LSS. In particular we
revealed a positive and linear dependency between the stellar mass, the
absolute magnitude and the color of a galaxy with the corresponding cosmic
density field. A remaining subset of data shows inverted correlations, which
might be an artifact of non-linear redshift distortions.

The theory involves an infinite number of bosonic fields arising from
bosonizing the fluctuations of the shape of the composite Fermi surface. At
zero momentum there are $O(N)$ neutral excitations, each carrying a
well-defined spin that runs integer values $2,3,\ldots$. The mixing of modes at
nonzero momentum $q$ leads to the characteristic bending down of the lowest
excitation and the appearance of the magnetoroton minima. A purely algebraic
argument shows that the magnetoroton minima are located at
$q\ell_B=z_i/(2N+1)$, where $\ell_B$ is the magnetic length and $z_i$ are the
zeros of the Bessel function $J_1$, independent of the microscopic details. We
argue that these minima are universal features of any two-dimensional Fermi
surface coupled to a gauge field in a small background magnetic field.

infrared galaxies (LIRGs) from the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey
(GOALS) sample using non-parametric coefficients and compare their morphology
as a function of wavelength. We rely on images obtained in the optical (B- and
I-band) as well as in the infrared (H-band and 5.8$\mu$m). Our classification
is based on the calculation of $Gini$ and the second order of light ($M_{20}$)
non-parametric coefficients which we explore as a function of stellar mass
($M_\star$), infrared luminosity ($L_{IR}$) and star formation rate (SFR). We
investigate the relation between $M_{20}$, the specific SFR (sSFR) and the dust
temperature ($T_{dust}$) in our galaxy sample. We find that $M_{20}$ is a
better morphological tracer than $Gini$, as it allows to distinguish systems
formed by double systems from isolated and post-merger LIRGs. The
multi-wavelength analysis allows us to identify a region in the $Gini$-$M_{20}$
parameter space where ongoing mergers reside, regardless of the band used to
calculate the coefficients. In particular when measured in the H-band, this
region can be used to identify ongoing mergers, with a minimal contamination
from LIRGs in other stages. We also find that while the sSFR is positively
correlated with $M_{20}$ when measured in the mid-infrared, i.e. star-bursting
galaxies show more compact emission, it is anti-correlated with the B-band
based $M_{20}$. We interpret this as the spatial decoupling between obscured
and un-obscured star formation, whereby the ultraviolet/optical size of a LIRGs
experience an intense dust enshrouded central starburst is larger than in the
one in the mid-infrared since the contrast between the nuclear to the extended
disk emission is smaller in the mid-infrared. This has important implications
for high redshift surveys of dusty sources. [abridged]

$X=\gamma,h,Z$) are always accompanied, at lower energies, by a continuum
gamma-ray spectrum stemming both from radiative corrections ($X=\gamma$) and
from the decay debris of the second particle possibly present in the final
state ($X=h,Z$). This model-independent gamma-ray emission can be exploited to
derive novel limits on gamma-ray lines that do not rely on the line-feature.
Although such limits are not expected to be as stringent, they can be used to
probe the existence of $\gamma$-ray lines for dark matter masses beyond the
largest energies accessible to current telescopes. Here, we use continuous
gamma-ray searches from Fermi-LAT observations of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal
galaxies and from H.E.S.S. observations of the Galactic Halo to extend the
limits on the annihilation cross sections into monochromatic photons to dark
matter masses well beyond $500$ GeV (Fermi-LAT) and $20$ TeV (H.E.S.S.). In
this large mass regime, our results provide the first constraints on

as lognormal random fields, and this approach has been successfully applied in
the past to the matter density and weak lensing convergence fields separately.
We argue that this approach has fundamental limitations which prevent its use
for jointly modelling these two fields since the lognormal distribution's shape
can prevent certain correlations to be attainable. Given the need of ongoing
and future large-scale structure surveys for fast joint simulations of
clustering and weak lensing, we propose two ways of overcoming these
limitations. The first approach slightly distorts the power spectra of the
fields using one of two algorithms that minimises either the absolute or the
fractional distortions. The second one is by obtaining more accurate
convergence marginal distributions, for which we provide a fitting function, by
integrating the lognormal density along the line of sight. The latter approach
also provides a way to determine directly from theory the skewness of the
convergence distribution and, therefore, the parameters for a lognormal fit. We
present the public code Full-sky Lognormal Astro-fields Simulation Kit (FLASK)
which can make tomographic realisations on the sphere of an arbitrary number of
correlated lognormal or Gaussian random fields by applying either of the two
proposed solutions, and show that it can create joint simulations of clustering
and lensing with sub-per-cent accuracy over relevant angular scales and
redshift ranges.

[U]LIRGs, which mainly covers the less explored LIRG luminosity range. This
study is based on the analysis of the spatially integrated and spatially
resolved spectra of the NaD feature obtained with the VIMOS/VLT-IFS. Analyzing
spatially integrated spectra, we find that the contribution of stars to the
observed NaD-EWs is generally small (<35%), and therefore this feature is
dominated by ISM absorption. After subtracting the stellar contribution, we
find that the pure-ISM integrated spectra generally show blueshifted NaD
profiles, indicating neutral gas outflow velocities V in the range 65-260 km/s.
Excluding galaxies with AGNs, V shows a dependency with the SFR of the type V
\propto SFR^0.15 (in rather good agreement with previous results). The
spatially resolved analysis was performed for 40 galaxies, 22 of which have
neutral gas velocity fields dominated by noncircular motions with signatures of
cone-like winds. However, a modest number of targets (11/40) show disk
rotation. We found that the wind masses are in the range (0.4-7.5)x10^8 Msun,
reaching up to 3% of the dynamical mass of the host. The mass rates are
typically only 0.2-0.4 times the SFR indicating that, the mass loss is too
small to slow down the SF significantly. In the majority of cases, the velocity
of the outflowing gas is not sufficient to escape the host potential well and,
therefore, most of the gas rains back into the disk. On average V/v(esc) is
higher in less massive galaxies, confirming that the galaxy mass has a primary
role in shaping the recycling of gas and metals. The comparison between the
wind power and kinetic power of the starburst associated with SNe indicates
that the starburst could drive the outflows in nearly all the [U]LIRGs
galaxies, as the wind power is generally lower than 20% of the kinetic power
supplied by the starburst.

significant number of real-time line monitoring devices in the distribution

collected from the grid loads. The learning algorithm is based on conditional
independence tests for continuous variables over chordal graphs and has wide
applicability. It is proven that the scheme can be used for several power flow
laws (DC or AC approximations) and more importantly is independent of the
specific probability distribution controlling individual bus power usage. The
complexity of the algorithm is discussed and its performance is demonstrated by

  Processing",,,"10.1137/15M1038074",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent work in image processing suggests that operating on (overlapping)
patches in an image may lead to state-of-the-art results. This has been
demonstrated for a variety of problems including denoising, inpainting,
deblurring, and super-resolution. The work reported in [1,2] takes an extra
step forward by showing that ordering these patches to form an approximate
shortest path can be leveraged for better processing. The core idea is to apply
a simple filter on the resulting 1D smoothed signal obtained after the
patch-permutation. This idea has been also explored in combination with a
wavelet pyramid, leading eventually to a sophisticated and highly effective
regularizer for inverse problems in imaging. In this work we further study the
patch-permutation concept, and harness it to propose a new simple yet effective
regularization for image restoration problems. Our approach builds on the
classic Maximum A'posteriori probability (MAP), with a penalty function
consisting of a regular log-likelihood term and a novel permutation-based
regularization term. Using a plain 1D Laplacian, the proposed regularization
forces robust smoothness (L1) on the permuted pixels. Since the permutation
originates from patch-ordering, we propose to accumulate the smoothness terms
over all the patches' pixels. Furthermore, we take into account the found
distances between adjacent patches in the ordering, by weighting the Laplacian
outcome. We demonstrate the proposed scheme on a diverse set of problems: (i)
severe Poisson image denoising, (ii) Gaussian image denoising, (iii) image
deblurring, and (iv) single image super-resolution. In all these cases, we use
recent methods that handle these problems as initialization to our scheme. This
is followed by an L-BFGS optimization of the above-described penalty function,
leading to state-of-the-art results, and especially so for highly ill-posed
cases.

timing analysis performed with TempoNest yields the detection of several new
parameters: seven parallaxes, nine proper motions and, in the case of six
binary pulsars, an apparent change of the semi-major axis. We find the NE2001
Galactic electron density model to be a better match to our parallax distances
(after correction from the Lutz-Kelker bias) than the M2 and M3 models by
Schnitzeler (2012). However, we measure an average uncertainty of 80\%
(fractional) for NE2001, three times larger than what is typically assumed in
the literature. We revisit the transverse velocity distribution for a set of 19
isolated and 57 binary MSPs and find no statistical difference between these
two populations. We detect Shapiro delay in the timing residuals of PSRs

the grid has a constant number of rows, a constant number of different

of the small lobe of its bilobate nucleus. Such activity is unique among the
comet nuclei visited by spacecraft, and suggests that CO2 ice is very near the
surface, which is inconsistent with our expectations of an object that
thermophysically evolved for ~45 million years prior to entering the Jupiter
Family of comets. Here we explain this pattern of activity by showing that a
very plausible recent episode of rapid rotation (rotation period of ~11 [10-13]
hours) would have induced avalanches in Hartley 2's currently active regions
that excavated down to CO2-rich ices and activated the small lobe of the
nucleus. At Hartley 2's current rate of spindown about its principal axis, the
nucleus would have been spinning fast enough to induce avalanches ~3-4 orbits
prior to the DIXI flyby (~1984-1991). This coincides with Hartley 2's discovery
in 1986, and implies that the initiation of CO2 activity facilitated the
comet's discovery. During the avalanches, the sliding material would either be
lofted off the surface by gas activity, or possibly gained enough momentum
moving downhill (toward the tip of the small lobe) to slide off the nucleus.
Much of this material would have failed to reach escape velocity, and would
reimpact the nucleus, forming debris deposits. The similar size frequency
distribution of the mounds observed on the surface of Hartley 2 and chunks of
material in its inner coma suggest that the 20-40 meter mounds observed by the
DIXI mission on the surface of Hartley 2 are potentially these fallback debris
deposits. As the nucleus spun down from a rotation period of ~11 hours to 18.34
hours at the time of the DIXI flyby, the location of potential minima, where
materials preferentially settle, migrated about the surface, allowing us to
place relative ages on most of the imaged terrains of the nucleus.

helicity-dependent and later helicity-independent switching was also
demonstrated on the same material. Recently, all-optical switching has also
been discovered for a much larger variety of magnetic materials (ferrimagnetic,
ferromagnetic films and granular nanostructures), where the theoretical models
explaining the switching in GdFeCo films do not appear to apply, thus
questioning the uniqueness of the microscopic origin of all-optical switching.
Here, we show that two different all-optical switching mechanisms can be
distinguished; a ""single pulse"" switching and a ""cumulative"" switching process
whose rich microscopic origin is discussed. We demonstrate that the latter is a
two-step mechanism; a heat-driven demagnetization followed by a
helicity-dependent remagnetization. This is achieved by an all-electrical and
time-dependent investigation of the all-optical switching in ferrimagnetic and
ferromagnetic Hall crosses via the anomalous Hall effect, enabling to probe the
all-optical switching on different timescales.

Communication among cells is a primary means for cells to interact with each

of cells and the diversity of intracellular and intercellular interactions,
makes understanding multicellular systems a daunting task. To overcome this

Starting with thin, c-axis ice needle crystals, the subsequent growth
morphologies ranged from solid prismatic columns to hollow columns to complex
""fishbone"" dendritic structures as the supersaturation was increased. We
modeled the simpler morphologies using analytical techniques together with a
cellular-automata method that yields faceted crystalline structures in
diffusion-limited growth. We found that the molecular attachment coefficient
$\alpha_{prism}$ on faceted prism surfaces in air at -5 C is substantially
lower than that measured at low background air pressure. Our data show that
increasing $p_{air}$ from 0.01 to 1 bar reduces $\alpha_{prism}$ by nearly two
orders of magnitude at this temperature. In contrast, we find that
$\alpha_{basil}$ is essentially unaffected by air pressure over this range.
These and other measurements indicate that ice surfaces near the melting point
undergo a series of complex structural and dynamical changes with temperature
that remain largely unexplained at even a qualitative level.

matrix with i.i.d. standard Gaussian entries, which has a large average entry.
It was shown earlier by Bhamidi et al. that the largest average value of such a
matrix is $2\sqrt{\log n/k}$ with high probability. In the same paper an
evidence was provided that a natural greedy algorithm called Largest Average
Submatrix ($\LAS$) should produce a matrix with average entry approximately
$\sqrt{2}$ smaller.
  In this paper we show that the matrix produced by the $\LAS$ algorithm is
indeed $\sqrt{2\log n/k}$ w.h.p. Then by drawing an analogy with the problem of
finding cliques in random graphs, we propose a simple greedy algorithm which
produces a $k\times k$ matrix with asymptotically the same average value. Since
the greedy algorithm is the best known algorithm for finding cliques in random
graphs, it is tempting to believe that beating the factor $\sqrt{2}$
performance gap suffered by both algorithms might be very challenging.
Surprisingly, we show the existence of a very simple algorithm which produces a
matrix with average value $(4/3)\sqrt{2\log n/k}$.
  To get an insight into the algorithmic hardness of this problem, and
motivated by methods originating in the theory of spin glasses, we conduct the
so-called expected overlap analysis of matrices with average value
asymptotically $\alpha\sqrt{2\log n/k}$. The overlap corresponds to the number
of common rows and common columns for pairs of matrices achieving this value.
We discover numerically an intriguing phase transition at $\alpha^*\approx
1.3608..$: when $\alpha<\alpha^*$ the space of overlaps is a continuous subset
of $[0,1]^2$, whereas $\alpha=\alpha^*$ marks the onset of discontinuity, and
the model exhibits the Overlap Gap Property when $\alpha>\alpha^*$. We
conjecture that $\alpha>\alpha^*$ marks the onset of the algorithmic hardness.

the impact of hardware impairments on the secrecy performance of downlink
massive MIMO systems in the presence of a passive multiple-antenna
eavesdropper. Thereby, for the BS and the legitimate users, the joint effects
of multiplicative phase noise, additive distortion noise, and amplified
receiver noise are taken into account, whereas the eavesdropper is assumed to
employ ideal hardware. We derive a lower bound for the ergodic secrecy rate of
a given user when matched filter (MF) data precoding and artificial noise (AN)
transmission are employed at the BS. Based on the derived analytical
expression, we investigate the impact of the various system parameters on the
secrecy rate and optimize both the pilot sets used for uplink training and the
AN precoding. Our analytical and simulation results reveal that 1) the additive
distortion noise at the BS may be beneficial for the secrecy performance,
especially if the power assigned for AN emission is not sufficient; 2) all

water motions in their vicinity and, thus, in their rheotactic behavior. Here,
we propose a theoretical model consisting of a fishlike body equipped with
lateral pressure sensors in oncoming uniform flows. We compute the optimal
sensor locations that maximize the sensory output. Our results confirm recent
experimental findings that correlate the layout of the lateral line sensors

examine the behavioral response of the fishlike model as a function of its
orientation and swimming speed relative to the background flow. Our working
hypothesis is that fish respond to sensory information by adjusting their

a source $X$ wants to send information to a destination $Y$ with the help of a
relay $Z$ and the relay can communicate to the destination via an error-free
digital link of rate $R_0$, while $Y$ and $Z$ are conditionally independent and
identically distributed given $X$. We develop two new upper bounds on the
capacity of this channel that are tighter than existing bounds, including the
celebrated cut-set bound. Our approach significantly deviates from the standard
information-theoretic approach for proving upper bounds on the capacity of
multi-user channels. We build on the blowing-up lemma to analyze the
probabilistic geometric relations between the typical sets of the $n$-letter
random variables associated with a reliable code for communicating over this
channel. These relations translate to new entropy inequalities between the
$n$-letter random variables involved.
  As an application of our bounds, we study an open question posed by (Cover,
1987), namely, what is the minimum needed $Z$-$Y$ link rate $R_0^*$ in order
for the capacity of the relay channel to be equal to that of the broadcast cut.
We consider the special case when the $X$-$Y$ and $X$-$Z$ links are both binary
symmetric channels. Our tighter bounds on the capacity of the relay channel
immediately translate to tighter lower bounds for $R_0^*$. More interestingly,
we show that when $p\to 1/2$, $R_0^*\geq 0.1803$; even though the broadcast
channel becomes completely noisy as $p\to 1/2$ and its capacity, and therefore
the capacity of the relay channel, goes to zero, a strictly positive rate $R_0$
is required for the relay channel capacity to be equal to the broadcast bound.

robust and continuous mapping between voids at different redshifts, from
initial conditions to the present time. We discuss how the new approach
eliminates strong spurious effects of numerical origin when voids evolution is
traced by matching voids between successive snapshots (by analogy to halo
merger trees). We apply the new method to a cosmological simulation of a
standard LambdaCDM cosmological model and study evolution of basic properties
of typical voids (with effective radii between 6Mpc/h and 20Mpc/h at redshift

evolve in a collective way which barely modifies the overall distribution of
the axial ratios. The evolution appears to have a weak impact on mutual
alignments of voids implying that the present state is in large part set up by
the primordial density field. We present evolution of dark matter density
profiles computed on iso-density surfaces which comply with the actual shapes

recently, a different scaling behaviour has been shown to occur when the quench

investigation of the overall sediment budget for coastal regions. This overall
budget is crucial for the prediction of the morphological change of coastline
in engineering applications. Since the sediment transport in oscillatory flows
is dense particle-laden flow, appropriate modeling of the particle interaction
is critical. Although traditional two-fluid approaches have been applied to the
study of sediment transport in oscillatory flows, the approaches do not resolve
the interaction of the particles. Particle-resolved modeling of sediment
transport in oscillatory flows and the study of micromechanics of sediment
particles are still lacking. In this work, a parallel CFD-DEM solver that can
resolve the inter-particle collision is applied to study the granular
micromechanics of sediment particles in oscillatory flows. The results obtained
from the CFD-DEM solver are validated by using the experimental data of coarse
and medium sands. The comparison with experimental results suggests that the
flow velocity, the sediment flux and the net sediment transport rate predicted
by are satisfactory. Moreover, the micromechanic quantities of the sediment bed
are presented in detail, including Voronoi concentration, coordination number,
and particle interaction force. It is demonstrated that variation of these
micromechanic quantities at different phases in the oscillatory cycle is
significant, which is due to different responses of the sediment bed. To
investigate the structural properties of the sediment bed, the correlation of
the Voronoi volume fraction and coordination number are compared to the results
from the fluidized bed simulations. The consistency in the comparison indicates
the structural micromechanics of sediment transport and fluidized bed are
similar despite the differences in flow patterns.

mechanism and efficiency of cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration at supernova remnant
(SNR) shock fronts. The northeastern rim of the SNR RCW 86 is thought to be a
particularly efficient CR acceleration site, owing to the recent result in
which an extremely high shock velocity of ~6000 km/s was claimed (Helder et al.
2009). Here we revisit the same SNR rim with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, 11
years after the first observation. This longer baseline than previously
available allows us to determine a more accurate proper motion of the
nonthermal X-ray filament, revealing a much lower velocity of 3000 \pm 340 km/s
(and even slower at a brighter region). Although the value has dropped to a
half of that from the previous X-ray measurement, it is still higher than the
mean velocity of the H-alpha filaments in this region (~1200 km/s). This
discrepancy implies that the filaments bright in nonthermal X-rays and H-alpha
emission trace different velocity components, and thus a CR pressure
constrained by combining the X-ray kinematics and the H-alpha spectroscopy can
easily be overestimated. We also measure the proper motion of the thermal X-ray
filament immediately to the south of the nonthermal one. The inferred velocity
(720 \pm 360 km/s) is significantly lower than that of the nonthermal filament,
suggesting the presence of denser ambient material, possibly a wall formed by a
wind from the progenitor, which has drastically slowed down the shock.

per year, primarily due to minimum-ionizing electrons and positrons that arise
in the induced electromagnetic showers of e+e- `beamstrahlung' pairs produced
in the ILC beam-beam interaction. However, radiation damage to calorimeter
sensors may be dominated by hadrons induced by nuclear interactions of shower
photons, which are much more likely to contribute to the non-ionizing energy
loss that has been observed to damage sensors exposed to hadronic radiation. We
report here on the results of SLAC Experiment T-506, for which several
different types of silicon diode and gallium-arsenide sensors were exposed to

embedding the sensor under irradiation within a tungsten radiator, the exposure

essential importance for the dynamics, stability and function of biological

at the interfaces of lipid bilayers. Various force fields, such as the
united-atom Berger force field, its two improved versions by Kukol and by
Poger, and the all-atom Slipid force field developed recently, can be applied
to simulating the structures of lipid bilayer, with their structural
predictions in good agreement with experimental data. In this work, we show
that despite the similarity in structural predictions of lipid bilayers, there
are observable differences in formation of hydrogen bonds and the interaction
energy profiles between water and phospholipid groups at the lipid
bilayer/water interfaces, when four force fields for
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) phospholipids are employed in molecular
dynamics simulations. In particular, the Slipid force field yields more
hydrogen bonds between water and phospholipids and more symmetrical interaction
energy distributions for the two carboxylic groups on their respective acyl
tails, compared to the Berger and its two improved force fields. These
differences are mainly attributed to the different interfacial water
distributions and ability to form hydrogen bonds between interfacial water and
oxygen atoms of the DPPC lipids using different force fields. These results
would be helpful in understanding the behaviors of water as well as its
interaction with phospholipids at the lipid bilayer/water interfaces, and
provide a guide for making the appropriate choice on the force field in

hardware implementations. In this work, we focus on designing energy efficient
on-chip storage for the synaptic weights. In order to minimize the power
consumption of typical digital CMOS implementations of such large-scale
networks, the digital neurons could be operated reliably at scaled voltages by
reducing the clock frequency. On the contrary, the on-chip synaptic storage
designed using a conventional 6T SRAM is susceptible to bitcell failures at
reduced voltages. However, the intrinsic error resiliency of NNs to small
synaptic weight perturbations enables us to scale the operating voltage of the
6TSRAM. Our analysis on a widely used digit recognition dataset indicates that
the voltage can be scaled by 200mV from the nominal operating voltage (950mV)
for practically no loss (less than 0.5%) in accuracy (22nm predictive
technology). Scaling beyond that causes substantial performance degradation
owing to increased probability of failures in the MSBs of the synaptic weights.
We, therefore propose a significance driven hybrid 8T-6T SRAM, wherein the
sensitive MSBs are stored in 8T bitcells that are robust at scaled voltages due
to decoupled read and write paths. In an effort to further minimize the area
penalty, we present a synaptic-sensitivity driven hybrid memory architecture

framework shows that the proposed synaptic-sensitivity driven architecture

regression coefficients is an appropriate choice in the absence of any prior
information, a proper normal prior is desirable when prior information is
available or in modern high dimensional settings where the number of
coefficients ($p$) is greater than the sample size ($n$). For both choices of
priors, the resulting posterior density is intractable and a Data Dugmentation
(DA) Markov chain is used to generate approximate samples from the posterior
distribution. Establishing geometric ergodicity for this DA Markov chain is
important as it provides theoretical guarantees for constructing standard
errors for Markov chain based estimates of posterior quantities. In this paper,
we first show that in case of proper normal priors, the DA Markov chain is
geometrically ergodic *for all* choices of the design matrix $X$, $n$ and $p$
(unlike the improper prior case, where $n \geq p$ and another condition on $X$
are required for posterior propriety itself). We also derive sufficient
conditions under which the DA Markov chain is trace-class, i.e., the
eigenvalues of the corresponding operator are summable. In particular, this
allows us to conclude that the Haar PX-DA sandwich algorithm (obtained by
inserting an inexpensive extra step in between the two steps of the DA
algorithm) is strictly better than the DA algorithm in an appropriate sense.

inclusion, equivalence and sequential uniformisation problems are known to be
undecidable. In this paper, we investigate stronger variants of inclusion,
equivalence and sequential uniformisation, based on a general notion of
transducer resynchronisation, and show their decidability. We also investigate
the classes of finite-valued rational transductions and deterministic rational
transductions, which are known to have a decidable equivalence problem. We show
that sequential uniformisation is also decidable for them.

  frequency and burst size","27 pages, 11 figures",,,,"q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inside individual cells, expression of genes is stochastic across organisms
ranging from bacterial to human cells. A ubiquitous feature of stochastic
expression is burst-like synthesis of gene products, which drives considerable
intercellular variability in protein levels across an isogenic cell population.
One common mechanism by which cells control such stochasticity is negative
feedback regulation, where a protein inhibits its own synthesis. For a single
gene that is expressed in bursts, negative feedback can affect the burst
frequency or the burst size. In order to compare these feedback types, we study
a piecewise deterministic model for gene expression of a self-regulating gene.
Mathematically tractable steady-state protein distributions are derived and
used to compare the noise suppression abilities of the two feedbacks. Results
show that in the low noise regime, both feedbacks are similar in term of their
noise buffering abilities. Intriguingly, feedback in burst size outperforms the
feedback in burst frequency in the high noise regime. Finally, we discuss
various regulatory strategies by which cells implement feedback to control
burst sizes of expressed proteins at the level of single cells.

significant intrinsic uncertainty. Unfortunately, analysing and quantifying
this uncertainty is very challenging, particularly in high-dimensional
problems. As a result, while most modern mathematical imaging methods produce
impressive point estimation results, they are generally unable to quantify the
uncertainty in the solutions delivered. This paper presents a new general
methodology for approximating Bayesian high-posterior-density credibility
regions in inverse problems that are convex and potentially very
high-dimensional. The approximations are derived by using recent concentration
of measure results related to information theory for log-concave random
vectors. A remarkable property of the approximations is that they can be
computed very efficiently, even in large-scale problems, by using standard
convex optimisation techniques. In particular, they are available as a
by-product in problems solved by maximum-a-posteriori estimation. The
approximations also have favourable theoretical properties, namely they
outer-bound the true high-posterior-density credibility regions, and they are
stable with respect to model dimension. The proposed methodology is illustrated
on two high-dimensional imaging inverse problems related to tomographic
reconstruction and sparse deconvolution, where the approximations are used to
perform Bayesian hypothesis tests and explore the uncertainty about the
solutions, and where proximal Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are used as
benchmark to compute exact credible regions and measure the approximation

attracted considerable attention. Compared to deterministic approaches, the
probabilistic representation of the solution by the posterior distribution can
be exploited to explore and quantify its uncertainties. In applications where
the inverse solution is subject to further analysis procedures, this can be a
significant advantage. Alongside theoretical progress, various new
computational techniques allow to sample very high dimensional posterior
distributions: In [Lucka2012], a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posterior
sampler was developed for linear inverse problems with $\ell_1$-type priors. In
this article, we extend this single component Gibbs-type sampler to a wide
range of priors used in Bayesian inversion, such as general $\ell_p^q$ priors
with additional hard constraints. Besides a fast computation of the
conditional, single component densities in an explicit, parameterized form, a
fast, robust and exact sampling from these one-dimensional densities is key to
obtain an efficient algorithm. We demonstrate that a generalization of slice
sampling can utilize their specific structure for this task and illustrate the
performance of the resulting slice-within-Gibbs samplers by different computed
examples. These new samplers allow us to perform sample-based Bayesian
inference in high-dimensional scenarios with certain priors for the first time,

investigate this issue by analysing a well defined sample. To this end we use
the hard-band (2-10 keV) X-ray selected sources of the Chandra AEGIS fields,
chosen because of the availability of accurately derived flux sensitivity maps.
In particular we use the 186 hard-band sources with spectroscopic redshifts in
the range z=0.3-1.3, a range selected in order to contain the bulk of the AGN
while minimizing the contribution of unknown clustering and luminosity
evolution from very high redshifts. Using the projected spatial
auto-correlation function, we derive a clustering comoving length of 5.4+-1.0
Mpc (for gamma=1.8), consistent with results in the literature. We further
derive the angular correlation function and the corresponding spatial
clustering length using the Limber's inversion equation and a novel
parametrization of the clustering evolution model that also takes into account
the bias evolution of the host dark matter halo. The Limber's inverted spatial
comoving clustering length of 5.5+-1.2 Mpc at a median redshift of z~0.75,
matches the directly measured one, from the spatial correlation function
analysis, but for a significant non-linear contribution to the growing mode of
perturbations, estimated independently from literature results of x_0 at
different redshifts. Therefore, using this sample of X-ray AGN and our

depends on the approximation of the unresolvable scales of the continuous
solution. In general, subgrid scale techniques consist in the addition of a
residual based term to the basic Galerkin formulation. The application of a
standard residual based stabilization method to a linear eigenvalue problem
leads to a quadratic eigenvalue problem in discrete form which is physically
inconvenient. As a distinguished feature of the present study, we take the
space of the unresolved subscales orthogonal to the finite element space, which
promises a remedy to the above mentioned complication. In essence, we put
forward that only if the orthogonal projection is used, the residual is
simplified and the use of term by term stabilization is allowed. Thus, we do
not need to put the whole residual in the formulation, and the linear
eigenproblem form is recovered properly. We prove that the method applied is
convergent, and present the error estimates for the eigenvalues and the

addition to mobility of the drone-cells in the vertical dimension as well as
the horizontal dimension, the differences between the air-to-ground and

placement of terrestrial base stations. In this paper, we first highlight the
properties of the dronecell placement problem, and formulate it as a 3-D

He created them by his habitually distorted presentation of data. One of his
self-created mysteries is the mystery of the alleged sudden spurt in the growth
rate of income per capita. This sudden spurt never happened. In order to
understand the growth rate of income per capita, its mathematical properties
are now explored and explained. The explanation is illustrated using the
historical world economic growth. Galor also wonders about the sudden spurt in
the growth rate of population. We show that this sudden spurt was also created

growth and of the growth of human population is yet to be explained but it
would be unproductive to try to explain the non-existing and self-created
mysteries of the growth process described in the scientifically unacceptable
Unified Growth Theory. However, the problem is much deeper than just the
examination of this theory. Demographic Growth Theory is based on the incorrect

generally accepted in the economic and demographic research, postulates
revolving around the concept of Malthusian stagnation and around a transition
from stagnation to growth. The study presented here and earlier similar

based on the mathematical analysis of data and on the correct understanding of
hyperbolic distributions.

three distinctly different phases. A Maxwell phase is followed by a
charge-rearrangement phase. Charging of cell membranes is completed in a third
phase. All three phases contribute to depolarization or hyperpolarization of
cell membranes. Due to the short duration of the spike the charge transfer is

Planck energy scale coming close to which the gravitational effects of physical
processes would inflate and struggle for equal rights so as to spoil the
validity of pure non-gravitational physical theories that governed well below
the Planck energy. Near the Planck scale, the Planck charges, Planck currents,
or Planck parameters can be defined and assigned to physical quantities such as
the single particle electric charge and magnetic charge as the ceiling value
obeyed by the low energy ordinary physics. The Dirac electric-magnetic charge
quantization relation as one form of electric-magnetic duality dictates that,
the present low value electric charge corresponds to a huge magnetic charge
value already passed the Planck limit so as to render theories of magnetic
monopoles into the strong coupling regime, and vice versa, that small and
tractable magnetic charge values correspond to huge electric charge values. It
suggests that for theoretic models in which the renormalization group equation
provides rapid growth for the running electric coupling constant, it is easier
for the dual magnetic monopoles to emerge at lower energy scales. Allowing
charges to vary with the Dirac electric-magnetic charge quantization relation
while keeping values under the Planck limit informs that the magnetic charge
value drops below the Planck ceiling value into the manageable region when the
electric coupling constant grows to one fourth at a model dependent energy
scale, and continues dropping towards half the value of the Planck magnetic
charge as the electric coupling constant continues growing at the model
dependent rate towards one near Planck energy scale.
