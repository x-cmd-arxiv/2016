unintentionally, use too general or inappropriate keywords to express their
requests. To overcome this situation, query expansion techniques aim at
transforming the user request by adding new terms, referred as expansion
features, that better describe the real intent of the users. We propose a
method that relies exclusively on relevant structures (as opposed to the use of
semantics) found in knowledge bases (KBs) to extract the expansion features. We
call our method Structural Query Expansion (SQE). The structural analysis of
KBs takes us to propose a set of structural motifs that connect their strongly
related entries, which can be used to extract expansion features. In this paper
we use Wikipedia as our KB, which is probably one of the largest sources of
information. SQE is capable of achieving more than 150% improvement over non
expanded queries and is able to identify the expansion features in less than
0.2 seconds in the worst case scenario. Most significantly, we believe that we
are contributing to open new research directions in query expansion, proposing
a method that is orthogonal to many current systems. For example, SQE improves
pseudo-relevance feedback techniques up to 13%

Einstein-Maxwell theory - absolutely no new physics has been inserted. The
fresh item is that the well-known asymptotically flat solutions of the
Einstein-Maxwell theory are transformed to a new coordinate system with
surprising and (seemingly) inexplicable results. We begin with the standard
description of (Null) Asymptotically Flat Space-Times described in conventional
Bondi-coordinates. After transforming the variables (mainly the asymptotic Weyl
tensor components) to a very special set of NU (Newman-Unti) coordinates, we
find a series of relations totally mimicking standard Newtonian classical
mechanics and Maxwell theory. The surprising and troubling aspect of these
relations is that the associated motion and radiation does not take place in
physical space-time. Instead these relations takes place in an unusual
inherited complex four-dimensional manifold referred to as H-Space that has no
immediate relationship with space-time. In fact these relations appear in two
such spaces, H-Space and its dual space H. 1

chiral anomaly~\cite{Adler,Bell}, predicted to occur in both systems, was
recently observed as a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR) in
Na$_3$Bi and in TaAs. An important issue is whether Weyl physics appears in a
broader class of materials. We report evidence for the chiral anomaly in the
half-Heusler GdPtBi. In zero field, GdPtBi is a zero-gap semiconductor with
quadratic bands. In a magnetic field, the Zeeman energy leads to Weyl nodes. We
have observed a large negative LMR with the field-steering properties specific
to the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly also induces strong suppression of
the thermopower. We report a detailed study of the thermoelectric response
function $\alpha_{xx}$ of Weyl fermions. The scheme of creating Weyl nodes from
quadratic bands suggests that the chiral anomaly may be observable in a broad
class of semimetals.

specifically, this article proves the pentagonal ice-ray conjecture of Henley

packing of congruent regular pentagons in the plane is a double lattice, formed
by aligned vertical columns of upward pointing pentagons alternating with
aligned vertical columns of downward pointing pentagons. The strategy is based
on estimates of the areas of Delaunay triangles. Our strategy reduces the
pentagonal ice-ray conjecture to area minimization problems that involve at
most four Delaunay triangles. These minimization problems are solved by
computer. The computer-assisted portions of the proof use techniques such as
interval arithmetic, automatic differentiation, and a meet-in-the-middle

NICA collider facility are expected to produce systems of extreme net-baryon
densities and can thus reach yet unexplored regions of the QCD phase diagram.
Here, one expects the phase transition between the plasma of deconfined quarks
and gluons and the hadronic matter to be of first order. A discovery of the
first-order phase transition would as well prove the existence of the QCD
critical point, a landmark in the phase diagram. In order to understand
possible signals of the first-order phase transition in heavy-ion collision
experiments it is very important to develop dynamical models of the phase
transition. Here, we discuss the opportunities of studying dynamical effects at
the QCD first-order phase transition within our model of nonequilibrium chiral

AF networks that simultaneously avoid 1) exponential capacity decay and 2)
exponential transmit power growth across the network. This is achieved by
ensuring the network's Lyapunov exponent is zero.

forecast to occur under global climate change. The impacts of climate extremes
on forest productivity and health are complicated by potential interactions
with disturbance events and stand dynamics. The effects of stand dynamics on
forest responses to climate and disturbance are particularly important given
forest characteristics driven by stand dynamics can be modified through forest
management with the goal of increasing forest resistance and resilience to
climate change. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian state-space model allowing
climate effects on tree growth to vary over time and in relation to climate
extremes, disturbance events, and stand dynamics. We apply the model to a
dendrochronology dataset comprising measurements from forest stands of varying
composition, structure, and development stage in northeastern Minnesota.
Results indicate average forest growth was most sensitive to variables
describing climatic water deficit. Forest growth responses to water deficit
were partitioned into responses driven by climatic threshold exceedances and
interactions with forest tent caterpillar defoliation. Forest growth was both
resistant and resilient to climate extremes with the majority of forest growth
responses occurring after multiple climatic threshold exceedances or insect
defoliation events. Forest growth was most sensitive to water deficit during
periods of high stem density following major regeneration events when average
inter-tree competition was high. Results suggest that forest growth resistance
and resilience to interactions between climate extremes and insect defoliation
can be increased through management steps such as thinning to reduce
competition during early stages of stand development and small-group selection
harvests to maintain forest structures characteristic of older, mature stands.

  We further introduce the notion of a trapezoidal diagram of a crossing-free

In essence, such a diagram is obtained by augmenting the geometric graph in
question with its trapezoidal decomposition, and then forgetting about the
precise coordinates of individual vertices while preserving the vertical
visibility relations between vertices and segments. We note that trapezoidal
diagrams of triangulations are closely related to abstract upward
triangulations.
  We study the numbers of such diagrams in the cases of (i) perfect matchings

2014/10 within approximately 40 degrees from disk center. I select the roughly
4% of all regions that display a distinctly nonpotential coronal configuration
in loops with a length comparable to the scale of the active region, and all
that emit GOES X-class flares. The data for 41 regions confirm, with a single
exception, that strong-field, high-gradient polarity inversion lines (SHILs)
created during emergence of magnetic flux into, and related displacement
within, pre-existing active regions are associated with X-class flares. Obvious
nonpotentiality in the active region-scale loops occurs in 6 of 10 selected
regions with X-class flares, all with relatively long SHILs along their primary
polarity inversion line, or with a long internal filament there.
Nonpotentiality can exist in active regions well past the flux-emergence phase,
often with reduced or absent flaring. I conclude that the dynamics of the flux
involved in the compact SHILs is of preeminent importance for the large-flare
potential of active regions within the next day, but that their associated
currents may not reveal themselves in active region-scale nonpotentiality. In
contrast, active region-scale nonpotentiality, which can persist for many days,
may inform us about the eruption potential other than those from SHILs which is
almost never associated with X-class flaring.

  Point-Source Analysis of Fermi Large Area Telescope Data","Accepted for publication in ApJS","ApJS 223 26 (2016)","10.3847/0067-0049/223/2/26",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most of the celestial gamma rays detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT)
aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope originate from the interstellar
medium when energetic cosmic rays interact with interstellar nucleons and
photons. Conventional point and extended source studies rely on the modeling of
this diffuse emission for accurate characterization. We describe here the
development of the Galactic Interstellar Emission Model (GIEM) that is the
standard adopted by the LAT Collaboration and is publicly available. The model
is based on a linear combination of maps for interstellar gas column density in
Galactocentric annuli and for the inverse Compton emission produced in the
Galaxy. We also include in the GIEM large-scale structures like Loop I and the
Fermi bubbles. The measured gas emissivity spectra confirm that the cosmic-ray
proton density decreases with Galactocentric distance beyond 5 kpc from the
Galactic Center. The measurements also suggest a softening of the proton
spectrum with Galactocentric distance. We observe that the Fermi bubbles have
boundaries with a shape similar to a catenary at latitudes below 20 degrees and
we observe an enhanced emission toward their base extending in the North and
South Galactic direction and located within 4 degrees of the Galactic Center.

sensitive detectors with Anger camera type readout. The simulation module of
ANTS2 is based on ROOT package from CERN, which is used to store the detector
geometry and to perform 3D navigation. The module is capable of simulating
particle sources, performing particle tracking, generating photons of primary
and secondary scintillation, tracing optical photons and generating photosensor
signals. The reconstruction module features several position reconstruction
methods based on the statistical reconstruction algorithms (including GPU-based
implementations), artificial neural networks and k-NN searches. The module can
process simulated as well as imported experimental data containing photosensor
signals. A custom library for B-spline parameterization of spatial response of
photosensors is implemented which can be used to calculate and parameterize the
spatial response of a detector. The package includes a graphical user interface
with an extensive set of configuration, visualization and analysis tools. ANTS2
is being developed with the focus on the iterative (adaptive) reconstruction of
the detector response using flood field irradiation data. The package is
implemented in C++ programming language and it is a multiplatform, open source
project.

first identify the distinct spatial components of the underlying system,
referred to as ""domains"", and second to infer the connections between them. A
domain is a spatially contiguous region of highly correlated temporal activity.
The core of a domain is a point or subregion at which a metric of local
homogeneity is maximum across the entire domain. We compute a domain as the
maximum-sized set of spatially contiguous cells that include the detected core
and satisfy a homogeneity constraint, expressed in terms of the average
pairwise cross-correlation across all cells in the domain. Domains may be
spatially overlapping. Different domains may have correlated activity,
potentially at a lag, because of direct or indirect interactions. The proposed
edge inference method examines the statistical significance of each lagged
cross-correlation between two domains, infers a range of lag values for each
edge, and assigns a weight to each edge based on the covariance of the two
domains. We illustrate the application of {\delta}-MAPS on data from two
domains: climate science and neuroscience.

the $b$ hadron production mechanism at a hadron collider. The first network is
trained to select charged kaons produced in association with the $B_s^0$ meson.
The second network combines the kaon charges to assign the $B_s^0$ flavour and
estimates the probability of a wrong assignment. The algorithm is calibrated
using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$ collected
by the LHCb experiment in proton-proton collisions at 7 and 8 TeV
centre-of-mass energies. The calibration is performed in two ways: by resolving
the $B_s^0$-$\bar{B}_s^0$ flavour oscillations in $B_s^0 \to D_s^- \pi^+$
decays, and by analysing flavour-specific $B_{s 2}^{*}(5840)^0 \to B^+ K^-$
decays. The tagging power measured in $B_s^0 \to D_s^- \pi^+$ decays is found
to be $(1.80 \pm 0.19({\rm stat}) \pm 0.18({\rm syst}))$\%, which is an
improvement of about 50\% compared to a similar algorithm previously used in

introductory physics courses. One characteristic distinguishing more
experienced physicists from novice students is that they make better use of
problem solving as a learning opportunity. Experts were found to spend more
time than novices in monitoring their work, reflecting upon their possibly
deficient approach to solving a problem, reconsidering their choices as
necessary, and extending and refining their knowledge structure. Moreover,
research on worked-out examples suggests that better performing students are
those who self-explain, that is, elaborate to themselves what they are learning
from those examples, generate inferences, acknowledge mismatches between their
own approach and that of the example, and attempt to resolve conflicts
(self-repair). Indeed, physics instructors often express concern that many
students do not make an effort to learn from their mistakes after the graded
problems are returned to them. Here, we discuss an investigation focusing on
how well introductory physics students self-diagnose their mistakes in their
quiz solutions and its effect on subsequent problem solving in different
interventions.

a user may be simultaneously served by multiple base stations. Second, we
account for, mathematically, the coupling relation between the base stations'
load levels that are dependent on each other due to inter-cell interference. We
formulate two optimization problems, sum load minimization (MinSumL) and
maximum load minimization (MinMaxL). We prove that both MinSumL and MinMaxL are
NP-hard. We propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based scheme by
means of linearization. This approach also leads to a bounding scheme for
performance benchmarking. Then, we derive a set of partial optimality
conditions. Fulfillment of the conditions will guarantee performance
improvement for both MinSumL and MinMaxL. A solution algorithm is then derived
based on the conditions. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the

energy is introduced. The difference between this latter and its equilibrium
form represents the minimal work done by the chemostats to bring the network in
its nonequilibrium state. It is minimized in nondriven detailed-balanced
networks (i.e. networks which relax to equilibrium states) and has an
interesting information-theoretic interpretation. We further show that the
entropy production of complex balanced networks (i.e. networks which relax to
special kinds of nonequilibrium steady states) splits into two non-negative
contributions. One charaterizing the dissipation of the nonequilibrium steady
state and the other the transients due to relaxation and driving. Our theory

image recognition performance in recent years. One example is the Inception
architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively
low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in
conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art
performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the
latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question of whether
there are any benefit in combining the Inception architecture with residual
connections. Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual
connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There
is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly
expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We
also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and
non-residual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame
recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly.

very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and

(HGT). While it is widely recognized that horizontal acquisitions frequently
encompass multiple genes, it is unclear what the size distribution of
successfully transferred DNA segments looks like and what evolutionary forces
shape this distribution. Here, we identified 1790 gene family pairs that were
consistently co-gained on the same branches across a phylogeny of 53 E. coli
strains. We estimated a lower limit of their genomic distances at the time they
were transferred to their host genomes; this distribution shows a sharp upper
bound at 30 kb. The same gene-pairs can have larger distances (up to 70 kb) in
other genomes. These more distant pairs likely represent recent acquisitions
via transduction that involve the co-transfer of excised prophage genes, as
they are almost always associated with intervening phage-associated genes. The
observed distribution of genomic distances of co-transferred genes is much
broader than expected from a model based on the co-transfer of genes within
operons; instead, this distribution is highly consistent with the size
distribution of supra-operonic clusters (SOCs), groups of co-occurring and
co-functioning genes that extend beyond operons. Thus, we propose that SOCs
form a basic unit of horizontal gene transfer.

we focus our discussion on the magnetocaloric effect of this model by
presenting the isentropic curves and the Gruneisen parameters, as well as
showing the regions where the model exhibits an efficient magnetocaloric

the strong XY-anisotropy exhibits a particular behavior with a magnetocaloric

Hamiltonian version (Lagrangian version was presented in a previous paper). It
is universal, in the sense that it applies equally well to time dynamics and to
field theories on space-time. It is based on the notion of (Hamiltonian)
histories, which are sections of the (extended) phase space bundle. It is
developed in the space of sections, in contradistinction with the usual
formalism which works in the bundle manifold. In field theories, the formalism
remains covariant and does not require a spitting of space-time. It considers
space-time exactly in the same manner than time in usual dynamics, both being
particular cases of the evolution domain. It applies without modification when
the histories (the fields) are forms rather than scalar functions, like in
electromagnetism or in tetrad general relativity. We develop a differential
calculus in the infinite dimensional space of histories. It admits a

from dark matter (DM) annihilations. In the case of discrepancies between

cross section into cosmic rays by studying the shape of the energy spectrum. So
far all analyses of the extragalactic DM signal have assumed the standard
cosmological model (LambdaCDM) as the underlying theory. However, there are
alternative DM scenarios where the number of low-mass objects is significantly
suppressed. Therefore the characteristics of the gamma-ray and neutrino
emission in these models may differ from LambdaCDM as a result. Here we show
that the extragalactic isotropic signal in these alternative models has a
similar energy dependence to that in LambdaCDM, but the overall normalisation
is reduced. The similarities between the energy spectra combined with the flux
suppression could lead one to misinterpret possible evidence for models beyond
LambdaCDM as being due to CDM particles annihilating with a much weaker cross

generalizes and unifies several recent abstract convergence theorems. It is

stationary point of the objective function. Additional flexibility compared to
related approaches is gained by a descent property that is formulated with
respect to a function that is allowed to change along the iterations, a generic
distance measure, and an explicit/implicit relative error condition with
respect to finite linear combinations of distance terms. As an application of
the gained flexibility, the convergence of a block coordinate variable metric

shown that the trajectory of a ZEO has precisely one turning point that lies on
the boundary of the ergoregion for photons and inside the ergoregion for
massive particles. As a consequence, such trajectories enter the ergosphere
from the white hole region under horizon and leave it crossing the horizon

depend on the angular momentum. For particles with $% E>0$ this velocity is
bigger than for a ZEO, for $E<0$ it is smaller. General limitations on the

spectral index ($\alpha_{1.6}^{8.4} = 0.03$) and high brightness temperature

from the AGN. The radio to X-ray luminosity ratio of ${\rm log}(L_{\rm

emission from magnetized coronal winds, although unresolved radio jets are also
consistent with the data. Comparing new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array

$34\%$, and (insignificantly) $13\%$ flux density decreases between the 1990s

possibly due to the expansion and fading of internal shocks within the

variability demonstrates the AGN accretion-outflow connection, confirming that
the changing-look behaviour in Mrk 590 originates from variable accretion rates

J2212.5+0703 shows evidence of being spatially extended. If a gamma-ray source
without detectable emission at other wavelengths were unambiguously determined
to be spatially extended, it could not be explained by known astrophysics, and
would constitute a smoking gun for dark matter particles annihilating in a
nearby subhalo. With this prospect in mind, we scrutinize the gamma-ray
emission from this source, finding that it prefers a spatially extended profile
over that of a single point-like source with 5.1 sigma statistical
significance. We also use a large sample of active galactic nuclei and other
known gamma-rays sources as a control group, confirming, as expected, that
statistically significant extension is rare among such objects. We argue that
the most likely (non-dark matter) explanation for this apparent extension is a
pair of bright gamma-ray sources that serendipitously lie very close to each
other, and estimate that there is a chance probability of ~2% that such a pair
would exist somewhere on the sky. In the case of 3FGL J2212.5+0703, a model
with a second gamma-ray point source at the location of a known BZCAT/CRATES
radio source yields fits that are comparable in quality to those obtained for a
single extended source. If 3FGL J2212.5+0703 is a dark matter subhalo, it would
imply that dark matter particles have a mass of ~18-33 GeV and an annihilation
cross section on the order of sigma v ~ 10^-26 cm^3/s (for the representative
case of annihilations to bb), similar to the values required to generate the
Galactic Center gamma-ray excess.

CIZA J2242.8+5301 (the ""Sausage"" Cluster) is associated with cosmic ray (CR)
electrons that are accelerated at a shock through the diffusive shock
acceleration (DSA) mechanism. However, recent radio observations have shown
that the radio spectrum is curved, which is inconsistent with the prediction of
a simple DSA model. Moreover, the CR electron spectrum before being affected by
radiative cooling seems to be too hard for DSA. In this study, we show that
these facts are natural consequences if the electrons are reaccelerated in
turbulence downstream of the shock. In this model, DSA is not the main
mechanism for generating high-energy electrons. We find that the mean free path
of the electrons should be much shorter than the Coulomb mean free path for
efficient reacceleration. The scale of the turbulent eddies must be smaller
than the width of the relic. We also predict hard X-ray spectra of inverse
Compton scattering of photons.

outflow by a central source (possibly a T Tauri star) moving on G2's orbit and
interacting with a hot atmosphere surrounding SgrA* can have G2 and G2t as a
byproduct. G2 would be the bow-shock formed in the head of the source, while
G2t might be the result of the stripping of the rest of the shocked material by
the ram pressure of the surrounding hot gas and of its successive accumulation
in the trailing region. Mock position-velocity diagrams for the Br$\gamma$
emission for this simulation can indeed reproduce the correct position and
velocity of G2t, as well as the more tenuous material in between. Though some
tension between the observations and the simulated model remains, we argue that
this might be due to issues in the construction of observed position-velocity

hydrodynamic mixing - in our simulation.

the a priori assumption of a number of hypotheses on either the ICL morphology,
its surface brightness level or some properties of the brightest cluster galaxy

bound the ICL fraction in present-day galaxy clusters to the range 10-50%. We
developed a new algorithm based on the Chebyshev-Fourier functions (CHEFs) to
estimate the ICL fraction without relying on any a priori assumption on the
physical or geometrical characteristics of the ICL. We are able to not only
disentangle the ICL from the galatic luminosity but mark out the limits of the

Lovelock theories in which the gravitational action depends on some arbitrary

paper we study several aspects of these theories in general dimensions. We
start by identifying the generalized boundary term which makes the
gravitational variational problem well-posed. Then, we show that these theories
are equivalent to certain scalar-tensor theories and how this relation is
characterized by the Hessian of f. We also study the linearized equations of
the theory on general maximally symmetric backgrounds. Remarkably, we find that
these theories do not propagate the usual ghost-like massive gravitons
characteristic of higher-derivative gravities on such backgrounds. In some
non-trivial cases, the additional scalar associated to the trace of the metric
perturbation is also absent, being the usual graviton the only dynamical field.
In those cases, the linearized equations are exactly the same as in Einstein
gravity up to an overall factor, making them appealing as holographic toy
models. We also find constraints on the couplings of a broad family of
five-dimensional f(Lovelock) theories using holographic entanglement entropy.
Finally, we construct new analytic asymptotically flat and AdS/dS black hole

state networks (RS-networks) reflect underlying structural connectivity (SC).
If the connectome constrains how brain areas are functionally connected, the
stimulation of specific brain areas should produce a characteristic wave of
activity ultimately resolving into RS-networks. To systematically test this
hypothesis, we use a connectome-based network model of the human brain with
detailed realistic SC. We systematically activate all possible thalamic and
cortical areas with focal stimulation patterns and confirm that the stimulation
of specific areas evokes network patterns that closely resemble RS-networks.
For some sites, one or no RS-network is engaged, whereas for other sites more
than one RS-network may evolve. Our results confirm that the brain is operating
at the edge of criticality, wherein stimulation produces a cascade of
functional network recruitments, collapsing onto a smaller subspace that is
constrained in part by the anatomical local and long-range SCs. We suggest that
information flow, and subsequent cognitive processing, follows specific routes
imposed by connectome features, and that these routes explain the emergence of
RS-networks. Since brain stimulation can be used to diagnose/treat neurological
disorders, we provide a look-up table showing which areas need to be stimulated
to activate specific RS-networks.

decrease from Class 0 to Class I to flat-spectrum protostars, despite the broad

envelopes that inflate the stellar radii by a factor of several and are capped
by a denser shell of gas. Inflated envelopes and density inversions are
hallmarks of envelopes that become super-Eddington as they cross the iron-group
opacity peak, but these features disappear when mass loss is sufficiently
rapid. We re-examine the structures of steady, spherically symmetric wind
solutions that cross a sonic point at high optical depth, identifying the
physical mechanism by which outflow affects the stellar structure, and provide
an improved analytical estimate for the critical mass loss rate above which
extended structures are erased. Weak-flow solutions below this limit resemble
hydrostatic stars even in supersonic zones; however, we infer that these fail
to successfully launch optically thick winds. Wolf-Rayet envelopes will
therefore likely correspond to the strong, compact solutions. We also find that
wind solutions with negligible gas pressure are stably stratified at and below
the sonic point. This implies that convection is not the source of variability
in Wolf-Rayet stars, as has been suggested; but, acoustic instabilities provide
an alternative explanation. Our solutions are limited to high optical depths by
our neglect of Doppler enhancements to the opacity, and do not account for
acoustic instabilities at high Eddington factors; yet they provide useful
insights into Wolf-Rayet stellar structures.

local minima. More recently, some researchers observed that under reasonable
assumptions, the vast majority of critical points are saddle points, not true
minima. Both descriptions suggest that weights converge around a point in
weight space, be it a local optima or merely a critical point. However, it's
possible that neither interpretation is accurate. As neural networks are
typically over-complete, it's easy to show the existence of vast continuous
regions through weight space with equal loss. In this paper, we build on recent
work empirically characterizing the error surfaces of neural networks. We
analyze training paths through weight space, presenting evidence that apparent
convergence of loss does not correspond to weights arriving at critical points,
but instead to large movements through flat regions of weight space. While it's
trivial to show that neural network error surfaces are globally non-convex, we
show that error surfaces are also locally non-convex, even after breaking
symmetry with a random initialization and also after partial training.

serve as an estimator for driver gaze by connecting head rotation data with
manually coded gaze region data using both a statistical analysis approach and
a predictive (i.e., machine learning) approach. For the latter, classification
accuracy increased as visual angles between two glance locations increased. In
other words, the greater the shift in gaze, the higher the accuracy of
classification. This is an intuitive but important concept that we make
explicit through our analysis. The highest accuracy achieved was 83% using the
method of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for the binary gaze classification problem
of (1) the forward roadway versus (2) the center stack. Results suggest that
although there are individual differences in head-glance correspondence while
driving, classifier models based on head-rotation data may be robust to these
differences and therefore can serve as reasonable estimators for glance
location. The results suggest that driver head pose can be used as a surrogate
for eye gaze in several key conditions including the identification of

for s-wave pions up-to-and-including next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in
the formulation of chiral effective field theory, which includes pions,
nucleons and $\Delta(1232)$ degrees of freedom. In this paper we calculate the
near threshold cross section for the $pp \to d \pi^{+}$ reaction by performing
the convolution of the obtained operators with nuclear wave functions based on
modern phenomenological and chiral potentials. The available chiral $NN$ wave
functions are constructed with a cutoff comparable with the momentum transfer
scale inherent in pion production reactions. Hence, a significant portion of
the dynamical intermediate-range physics is thereby cut off by them. On the
other hand, the NNLO amplitudes evaluated with phenomenological wave functions
appear to be largely independent of the $NN$ model used and give corrections to
the dominant leading order contributions as expected from dimensional analysis.
The result gives support to the counting scheme used to classify the pion

the chirally suppressed neutral pion production. The explicit inclusion of the
$\Delta(1232)$ is found to be important but smaller than expected due to

This method makes use of Information Filtering Networks to produce a robust

inverse covariances computed on small sub-parts of the network. Being based on
local and low-dimensional inversions, this method is computationally very
efficient and statistically robust even for the estimation of inverse
covariance of high-dimensional, noisy and short time-series. Applied to
financial data our method results computationally more efficient than
state-of-the-art methodologies such as Glasso producing, in a fraction of the
computation time, models that can have equivalent or better performances but
with a sparser inference structure. We also discuss performances with sparse
factor models where we notice that relative performances decrease with the
number of factors. The local nature of this approach allows us to perform
computations in parallel and provides a tool for dynamical adaptation by
partial updating when the properties of some variables change without the need
of recomputing the whole model. This makes this approach particularly suitable
to handle big datasets with large numbers of variables. Examples of practical
application for forecasting, stress testing and risk allocation in financial

designed to elicit predictions about uncertain events without revealing too
much information about market participants' actions or beliefs. Our goal is to
design market mechanisms in which participants' trades or wagers influence the
market's behavior in a way that leads to accurate predictions, yet no single
participant has too much influence over what others are able to observe. We
study the possibilities and limitations of such mechanisms using tools from
differential privacy. We begin by designing a private one-shot wagering
mechanism in which bettors specify a belief about the likelihood of a future
event and a corresponding monetary wager. Wagers are redistributed among
bettors in a way that more highly rewards those with accurate predictions. We
provide a class of wagering mechanisms that are guaranteed to satisfy
truthfulness, budget balance in expectation, and other desirable properties
while additionally guaranteeing epsilon-joint differential privacy in the
bettors' reported beliefs, and analyze the trade-off between the achievable
level of privacy and the sensitivity of a bettor's payment to her own report.
We then ask whether it is possible to obtain privacy in dynamic prediction
markets, focusing our attention on the popular cost-function framework in which
securities with payments linked to future events are bought and sold by an
automated market maker. We show that under general conditions, it is impossible
for such a market maker to simultaneously achieve bounded worst-case loss and
epsilon-differential privacy without allowing the privacy guarantee to degrade
extremely quickly as the number of trades grows, making such markets
impractical in settings in which privacy is valued. We conclude by suggesting
several avenues for potentially circumventing this lower bound.

efficiency of single-carrier and OFDM transmission in massive MIMO systems that
use one-bit ADCs. A closed-form achievable rate, i.e., a lower bound on
capacity, is derived for a wideband system with a large number of channel taps
that employs low-complexity linear channel estimation and symbol detection.
Quantization results in two types of error in the symbol detection. The
circularly symmetric error becomes Gaussian in massive MIMO and vanishes as the
number of antennas grows. The amplitude distortion, which severely degrades the
performance of OFDM, is caused by variations between symbol durations in
received interference energy. As the number of channel taps grows, the
amplitude distortion vanishes and OFDM has the same performance as
single-carrier transmission. A main conclusion of this paper is that wideband
massive MIMO systems work well with one-bit ADCs.

axial-imaging method, but its practical use is limited by the weakness of the
light source and by artifacts in the images. A recent study using chirped-pulse
interferometry (CPI) has demonstrated dispersion-canceled and artifact-free OCT
with a classical system; however, unwanted background signals still remain
after removing the artifacts. Here, we propose a classical optical method that
realizes dispersion-canceled, artifact-free, and background-free OCT. We employ
a time-reversed system for Q-OCT with transform-limited input laser pulses to
achieve dispersion-canceled OCT with a classical system. We have also
introduced a subtraction method to remove artifacts and background signals.
With these methods, we experimentally demonstrated dispersion-canceled,
artifact-free, and background-free axial imaging of a coverglass and
cross-sectional imaging of the surface of a coin.

forces. Electroconvection is shown to enhance ion mixing and the net rate of
transport. However, systems subject to electroconvection inherently involve
fluid density variation set by salinity gradient in the bulk fluid. In this
study we thoroughly examine the interplay of gravitational convection and
chaotic electroconvection. Our results reveal that buoyant forces can
significantly influence the transport rates, otherwise set by
electroconvection, when the Rayleigh number $Ra$ of the system exceeds a value
$Ra \sim 1000$. We show that buoyancy forces can significantly alter the flow
patterns in these systems. When the buoyancy acts in the stabilizing direction,
it limits the extent of penetration of electroconvection, but without
eliminating it. When the buoyancy destabilizes the flow, it alters the
electroconvective patterns by introducing upward and downward fingers of
respectively light and heavy fluid.

$f:(\mathbb{P}^1,A)\to (\mathbb{P}^1,B)$ where $A \subseteq B$, allowing for

the enigmatic binary T-Tauri system VV Corona Australis, in which both
components host discs, but only one is visible at optical wavelengths. We seek
to understand the peculiarities of this system by searching for a model for the
binary which explains all the available continuum observations of the system.
We present new mid-infrared interferometry and near-infrared spectroscopy along
with archival millimetre-wave observations, which resolve the binary at 1.3mm
for the first time. We compute a grid of pre-main-sequence radiative transfer
models and calculate their posterior probabilities given the observed spectral
energy distributions and mid-infrared interferometric visibilities of the
binary components, beginning with the assumption that the only differences
between the two components are their inclination and position angles. Our
best-fitting solution corresponds to a relatively low luminosity T-tauri
binary, with each component's disc having a large scale height and viewed at
moderate inclination ($\sim 50^\circ$), with the infrared companion inclined by
$\sim 5^\circ$ degrees more than the primary. Comparing the results of our
model to evolutionary models suggests stellar masses $\sim 1.7$M$_\odot$ and an
age for the system of 3.5Myr, towards the upper end of previous estimates.
Combining these results with accretion indicators from near-IR spectroscopy, we
determine an accretion rate of 4.0$\times 10^{-8}$M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for the
primary. We suggest that future observations of VV~CrA and similar systems
should prioritise high angular resolution sub-mm and near-IR imaging of the

ratios are consistent with those of XRBs. These results, combined with their

models that are nevertheless flexible enough to capture the response properties
of real neurons. Here we examine the capabilities of recurrent point process
models known as Poisson generalized linear models (GLMs). These models are
defined by a set of linear filters, a point nonlinearity, and conditionally
Poisson spiking. They have desirable statistical properties for fitting and
have been widely used to analyze spike trains from electrophysiological
recordings. However, the dynamical repertoire of GLMs has not been
systematically compared to that of real neurons. Here we show that GLMs can
reproduce a comprehensive suite of canonical neural response behaviors,
including tonic and phasic spiking, bursting, spike rate adaptation, type I and
type II excitation, and two forms of bistability. GLMs can also capture
stimulus-dependent changes in spike timing precision and reliability that mimic
those observed in real neurons, and can exhibit varying degrees of
stochasticity, from virtually deterministic responses to greater-than-Poisson
variability. These results show that Poisson GLMs can exhibit a wide range of
dynamic spiking behaviors found in real neurons, making them well suited for
qualitative dynamical as well as quantitative statistical studies of
single-neuron and population response properties.

Existing strong coupling theories rely heavily on the so-called many-body

acknowledging the fact that the effective interparticle interaction (i.e., the
vertex function) becomes smaller above three dimensions, we propose an

application, we solve the equation of state for three- and two-dimensional

reversible fluctuations, similar to information theory where a constant number

bath states yields fluctuations that exhibit standard white noise; whereas with
bath states the power spectral density varies as S(f)~1/f over a wide range of

in this model. Both forms of the model match Crooks' fluctuation theorem

this end the photon's angular distribution is calculated in the potential
model. It contains contributions from electric dipole and quadrupole
transitions and their interference, which dramatically changes the photon's
angular distribution. The calculated distributions at different Big Bang
energies have a single peak at $\sim 50^{\circ}$. These calculations provide
the best kinematic conditions to measure the ${}^{2}{\rm

section and astrophysical factor are also derived by integrating the
differential cross section over the photon's solid angle. The LUNA data are in
excellent agreement with our calculations using a potential approach combined
with a well established asymptotic normalization coefficient for ${}^{6}{\rm

  Mechanics 2015",,"10.1088/1742-6596/701/1/012002",,"quant-ph physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In light of a recent reformulation of Bell's theorem from causal principles
by Howard Wiseman and the author, I argue that the conflict between quantum
theory and relativity brought up by Bell's work can be softened by a revision
of our classical notions of causation. I review some recent proposals for a
quantum theory of causation that make great strides towards that end, but
highlight a property that is shared by all those theories that would not have
satisfied Bell's realist inclinations. They require (implicitly or explicitly)
agent-centric notions such as ""controllables"" and ""uncontrollables"", or
""observed"" and ""unobserved"". Thus they relieve the tensions around Bell's
theorem by highlighting an issue more often associated with another deep
conceptual issue in quantum theory: the measurement problem. Rather than
rejecting those terms, however, I argue that we should understand why they seem
to be, at least at face-value, needed in order to reach compatibility between
quantum theory and relativity. This seems to suggest that causation, and thus
causal structure, are emergent phenomena, and lends support to the idea that a
resolution of the conflict between quantum theory and relativity necessitates a
solution to the measurement problem.

  Nonvanishing Noise",,,,,"math.DS math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For stochastic systems with nonvanishing noise, i.e., at the desired state
the noise port does not vanish, it is impossible to achieve the global
stability of the desired state in the sense of probability. This bad property
also leads to the loss of stochastic passivity at the desired state if a
radially unbounded Lyapunov function is expected as the storage function. To
characterize a certain (globally) stable behavior for such a class of systems,
the stochastic asymptotic weak stability is proposed in this paper which
suggests the transition measure of the state to be convergent and the
ergodicity. By defining stochastic weak passivity that admits stochastic
passivity only outside a ball centered around the desired state but not in the
whole state space, we develop stochastic weak passivity theorems to ensure that
the stochastic systems with nonvanishing noise can be globally\locally
stabilized in weak sense through negative feedback law. Applications are shown
to stochastic linear systems and a nonlinear process system, and some
simulation are made on the latter further.

superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is firstly slightly enhanced by
partial substitution of Pd with Ir and then it is suppressed gradually as Ir
content increases further. Meanwhile Ag substitution quickly suppresses the
system to a nonsuperconducting ground state. Hall effect measurements indicate
the variations of charge carrier density caused by Ir or Ag doping. The

strain rate tensor and the helical ends will respond to the strain field by
spinning around its long axis. The mean of the measured spinning rate is
non-zero and reflects the average stretching the particles experience. We use
Stokesian dynamics simulations of chiral dipoles in pure strain flow to
quantify the dependence of spinning on particle shape. Based on the known

producing coherent photon output. Despite negatively-charged nitrogen-vacancy
(NV$^-$) centres being discussed as a potential laser medium since the 1980's,
there have been no definitive observations of stimulated emission from
ensembles of NV$^-$ to date. Reasons for this lack of demonstration include the
short excited state lifetime and the occurrence of photo-ionisation to the
neutral charge state by light around the zero-phonon line. Here we show both
theoretical and experimental evidence for stimulated emission from NV$^-$
states using light in the phonon-sidebands. Our system uses a continuous wave
pump laser at 532 nm and a pulsed stimulating laser that is swept across the
phononic sidebands of the NV$^-$. Optimal stimulated emission is demonstrated
in the vicinity of the three-phonon line at 700 nm. Furthermore, we show the
transition from stimulated emission to photoionisation as the stimulating laser
wavelength is reduced from 700nm to 620 nm. While lasing at the zero-phonon

self-propelled dumbbells in two dimensions, we study how the behavior of the

inertial effects. We find in particular that the force exerted on a moving wall
between two chambers at equal density continuously vanishes at low damping
coefficient, and exhibits a complex dependence on the damping coefficient at
low density, when collisions are scarce. We further show that this behavior of
the pressure can to a significant extent be understood in terms of the
trajectories of individual particles close to and in contact with the wall.

nonparametrics to discover discriminative latent features for link prediction.
It inherits the advances of nonparametric Bayesian methods to infer the unknown
latent social dimension, while for discriminative link prediction, it adopts
the max-margin learning principle by minimizing a hinge-loss using the linear
expectation operator, without dealing with a highly nonlinear link likelihood
function. For posterior inference, we develop an efficient stochastic
variational inference algorithm under a truncated mean-field assumption. Our
methods can scale up to large-scale real networks with millions of entities and
tens of millions of positive links. We also provide a full Bayesian
formulation, which can avoid tuning regularization hyper-parameters.
Experimental results on a diverse range of real datasets demonstrate the
benefits inherited from max-margin learning and Bayesian nonparametric

conditions. The imposed basic states are so-called Chandrasekhar states, where
the azimuthal flow $U_\phi$ and magnetic field $B_\phi$ have the same radial
profiles. Mainly three particular profiles are considered: the Rayleigh limit,
quasi-Keplerian, and solid-body rotation. In each case we begin by computing
linear instability curves and their dependence on the magnetic Prandtl number
Pm. For the azimuthal wavenumber m=1 modes, the instability curves always scale
with the Reynolds number and the Hartmann number. For sufficiently small Pm
these modes therefore only become unstable for magnetic Mach numbers less than
unity, and are thus not relevant for most astrophysical applications. However,
modes with m>10 can behave very differently. For sufficiently flat profiles,
they scale with the magnetic Reynolds number and the Lundquist number, thereby
allowing instability also for the large magnetic Mach numbers of astrophysical
objects. We further compute fully nonlinear, three-dimensional equilibration of
these instabilities, and investigate how the energy is distributed among the
azimuthal (m) and axial (k) wavenumbers. In comparison spectra become steeper
for large m, reflecting the smoothing action of shear. On the other hand
kinetic and magnetic energy spectra exhibit similar behavior: if several
azimuthal modes are already linearly unstable they are relatively flat, but for
the rigidly rotating case where m=1 is the only unstable mode they are so steep
that neither Kolmogorov nor Iroshnikov-Kraichnan spectra fit the results. The
total magnetic energy exceeds the kinetic energy only for large magnetic
Reynolds numbers Rm>100.

presented. The latter, compared with the standard model, has an extended field
content adopting now an additional $A_4$ symmetry structure (along with the
standard model symmetry). As before, the see-saw mechanism can be realized in
several models of different types depending on different ways of neutrino mass
generation corresponding to the introduction of new (heavy in general) fields
with different symmetry structures. In the present paper, a general description
of all these see-saw types is made with a more detailed investigation on type-I
models, while for type-II and type-III models a similar strategy can be
followed. As within the original see-saw mechanism, the symmetry structure of
the standard model fields decides the number and the symmetry structure of the
new fields. In a model considered here, the scalar sector consists of three
standard-model-Higgs-like iso-doublets ($SU_L(2)$-doublets) forming together an
$A_4$-triplet, and three iso-singlets transforming as three singlets (1,$1^{'}$
and $1^{''}$) of $A_4$. In the lepton sector, the three left-handed lepton
iso-doublets form an $A_4$-triplet, while the three right-handed charged
leptons are either $A_4$-singlets in one version of the model, or components of
an $A_4$-triplet in another version. To generate neutrino masses through, say,
the type-I see-saw mechanism, it is natural to add four right-handed neutrino
multiplets, including one $A_4$-triplet and three $A_4$-singlets. For an
interpretation, the model is applied to deriving some physics quantities such
as neutrinoless double beta decay effective mass $|\langle m_{ee}\rangle|$, CP

ferroelectrics ideal candidates for the use in many applications such as memory

ferroelectric (FE) materials has become a flourishing field. One promising
route is to design the so-called hybrid improper ferroelectricity. However, the
previous approach based on the Landau theory is not easily adopted to the
systems that are unrelated to the Pbnm perovskite structure. To this end, we
develop a general design rule that is applicable to any systems. By combining
this rule with density functional theory calculations, we identify previously
unrecognized classes of FE materials. It shows that the R-3c perovskite
structure can become FE by substituting half of the B-site cations. ZnSrO2 with
a non-perovskite layered structure can also be FE through the anion
substitution. Moreover, our approach can be used to design new multiferroics as
illustrated in the case of fluorine substituted LaMnO3.

successfully exploited to transmit very large data-rates over short distances
to slowly moving users. Due to hardware complexity and cost constraints,
single-carrier modulation schemes, as opposed to the popular multi-carrier
schemes, are being considered for use at mmWave frequencies. This paper
presents preliminary studies on the achievable spectral efficiency on a
wireless MIMO link operating at mmWave in a typical 5G scenario. Two different
single-carrier modem schemes are considered, i.e. a traditional modulation
scheme with linear equalization at the receiver, and a single-carrier
modulation with cyclic prefix, frequency-domain equalization and FFT-based
processing at the receiver. Our results show that the former achieves a larger
spectral efficiency than the latter. Results also confirm that the spectral
efficiency increases with the dimension of the antenna array, as well as that
performance gets severely degraded when the link length exceeds 100 meters and
the transmit power falls below 0dBW. Nonetheless, mmWave appear to be very
suited for providing very large data-rates over short distances.

the identification of causes of contagion. Our methodology can thereby identify
the most relevant nodes with respect to onset of contagion in the network of

based on Compressed Sensing (CS). It achieves scalability through 3-Dimensional
Discrete Wavelet Transform (3-D DWT) and better compression ratio by exploiting
the inherent sparsity of the high-frequency wavelet sub-bands through CS. By
using 3-D DWT and a proposed adaptive measurement scheme called AMS at the
encoder, one can succeed in improving the compression ratio and reducing the
complexity of the decoder. The proposed video codec uses only 7% of the total
number of multipliers needed in a conventional CS-based video coding system. A
codebook of Bernoulli matrices with different sizes corresponding to the
predefined sparsity levels is maintained at both the encoder and the decoder.
Based on the calculated l0-norm of the input vector, one of the sixteen
possible Bernoulli matrices will be selected for taking the CS measurements and
its index will be transmitted along with the measurements. Based on this index,
the corresponding Bernoulli matrix has been used in CS reconstruction algorithm
to get back the high-frequency wavelet sub-bands at the decoder. At the
decoder, a new Enhanced Approximate Message Passing (EAMP) algorithm has been
proposed to reconstruct the wavelet coefficients and apply the inverse wavelet
transform for restoring back the video frames. Simulation results have
established the superiority of the proposed framework over the existing schemes
and have increased its suitability for VLSI implementation. Moreover, the coded
video is found to be scalable with an increase in a number of levels of wavelet
decomposition.

are produced non-perturbatively near the Enhanced Symmetry Point (ESP). Just
after the particle production, when the Higgs field is going away from the ESP,
these gauge bosons gain mass and decay or annihilate into Standard Model (SM)
fermions. Left-handed neutrinos can be generated in that way. If one assumes
the see-saw mechanism, the mass matrix of a pair of left and right-handed
neutrinos is non-diagonal. Although their mixing in the mass eigenstates is
negligible in the true vacuum, it could be significant near the edge of the
Higgs oscillation, where the off-diagonal component is large. Therefore, the
left-handed neutrinos generated from the gauge bosons can start neutrino
oscillation between the right-handed neutrinos. We study the particle
production when such L-R neutrino oscillation is significant. For a working
example, the non-thermal leptogenesis scenario after Higgs inflation is
examined, which cannot be realized without the L-R neutrino oscillation. The

non-compact 4-manifolds, which extend the known ones for closed 4-manifolds.
Assuming $M$ to be a connected oriented PL 4-manifold, our main results are the
following: (1) if $M$ is compact with (possibly empty) boundary, there exists a
simple branched cover $p:M \to S^4 - \mathop{\mathrm{Int}}(B^4_1 \cup \dots
\cup B^4_n)$, where the $B^4_i$'s are disjoint PL 4-balls, $n \geq 0$ is the
number of boundary components of $M$; (2) if $M$ is open, there exists a simple
branched cover $p : M \to S^4 - \mathop{\mathrm{End}} M$, where
$\mathop{\mathrm{End}} M$ is the end space of $M$ tamely embedded in $S^4$. In
both cases, the degree $d(p)$ and the branching set $B_p$ of $p$ can be assumed
to satisfy one of these conditions: (1) $d(p)=4$ and $B_p$ is a properly
self-transversally immersed locally flat PL surface; (2) $d(p)=5$ and $B_p$ is
a properly embedded locally flat PL surface. In the compact (resp. open) case,
by relaxing the assumption on the degree we can have $B^4$ (resp. $R^4$) as the
base of the covering. We also define the notion of branched covering between
topological manifolds, which extends the usual one in the PL category. In this
setting, as an interesting consequence of the above results, we prove that any
closed oriented topological 4-manifold is a 4-fold branched covering of $S^4$.
According to almost-smoothability of 4-manifolds, this branched cover could be
wild at a single point.

for relatively small molecules. The main bottlenecks lie in the construction of
the potential energy surface and in the size of the excitation space in the
vibrational configuration interaction (VCI) calculations. To address these
challanges, we use localized-mode coordinates to construct potential energy
surfaces and perform vibrational self-consistent field (L-VSCF) and L-VCI
calculations [P. T. Panek, Ch. R. Jacob, ChemPhysChem 15, 3365 (2014)] for all
vibrational modes of two prototypical test cases, the ethene and furan
molecules. We find that the mutual coupling between modes is reduced when
switching from normal-mode coordinates to localized-mode coordinates. When
using such localized-mode coordinates, we observe a faster convergence of the
$n$-mode expansion of the potential energy surface. This makes it possible to
neglect higher-order contributions in the $n$-mode expansion of the potential
energy surface or to approximate higher-oder contributions in hybrid potential
energy surfaces, which reduced the computational effort for the construction of
the anharmonic potential energy surface significantly. Moreover, we find that
when using localized-mode coordinates, the convergence with respect to the VCI
excitation space proceeds more smoothly and that the error at low orders is
reduced significantly. This makes it possible to devise low-cost models for
obtaining a first approximation of anharmonic corrections. This demonstrates
that the use of localized-mode coordinates can be beneficial already in
anharmonic vibrational calculations of small molecules, and provides a possible
avenue for enabling such accurate calculations also for larger molecules.

ferromagnet-normal metal (FM/NM) structures can be used to tailor the local

with respect to the applied MW field which depends on the sample geometry. The
induced fields can thus partially compensate the applied MW field, effectively
screening the FM in selected parts of the sample. The highly localized fields
produced by eddy currents enable the excitation of spin wave modes with
non-zero wave vectors, in contrast to the uniform k = 0 mode normally excited
in FMR experiments. We find that the orientation of the applied MW field is one
of the key parameters controlling the eddy-current effects. The induced
currents are maximized when the applied MW field is oriented perpendicular to
the sample plane. Increasing the magnitude of the eddy currents results in a
stronger induced MW field, enabling a more effective screening of the applied

build a simple network using only labels and then we test how much adding a

The proposed approach does not require transformation of label space, gives
interpretable results and allows for attractive visualization of dependency

some theoretical properties of the Ising model and the score statistic. We also
discuss feature ranking procedure based on fitting Ising model using $l_1$

research if open source technology can be used to mirror the contents of a

galaxies appear to have been discovered in the so-called Fast Radio Bursts.
These signals are dispersed according to a precise physical law and this
dispersion is a key observable quantity which, in tandem with a redshift
measurement, can be used for fundamental physical investigations. While every
fast radio burst has a dispersion measurement, none before now have had a
redshift measurement, due to the difficulty in pinpointing their celestial
coordinates. Here we present the discovery of a fast radio burst and the
identification of a fading radio transient lasting $\sim 6$ days after the
event, which we use to identify the host galaxy; we measure the galaxy's
redshift to be $z=0.492\pm0.008$. The dispersion measure and redshift, in
combination, provide a direct measurement of the cosmic density of ionised
baryons in the intergalactic medium of $\Omega_{\mathrm{IGM}}=4.9 \pm 1.3\%$,
in agreement with the expectation from WMAP, and including all of the so-called
""missing baryons"". The $\sim6$-day transient is largely consistent with a short
gamma-ray burst radio afterglow, and its existence and timescale do not support
progenitor models such as giant pulses from pulsars, and supernovae. This
contrasts with the interpretation of another recently discovered fast radio
burst, suggesting there are at least two classes of bursts.

finite structure and DB-ASMs are restricted by allowing quantifiers only over
the database part of a state, we resolve this problem by taking update sets
explicitly into the logic, i.e. by using an additional modal operator $[X]$,

The DB-ASM logic provides a powerful verification tool to study properties of

discovered to have a shallow decay phase by the {\em Swift} satellite, whose

phase, relativistic wind bubbles (RWBs) and structured ejecta, which could
originate from millisecond magnetars and rapidly-rotating black holes,
respectively. Based on these models, we here investigate polarization evolution
in the shallow decay phase of X-ray and optical afterglows. We find that in the
RWB model, a significant bump of the polarization degree evolution curve
appears during the shallow decay phase of both optical and X-ray afterglows,
while the polarization position angle changes its direction by $90^\circ$
abruptly. In the structured ejecta model, however, the polarization degree does
not evolve significantly during the shallow decay phase of afterglows, no
matter whether the magnetic field configuration in the ejecta is random or
globally large-scale. Therefore, we conclude that these two models for the
shallow decay phase and relevant central engines would be testable with future
polarization observations.

qualitative features of rough contact problems (linearity in area-load,
negative exponential dependence of load on separation which means also
linearity of stiffness with load), the exact value of the coefficients are not
precise for the idealized case of Gaussian distribution of heigths. This is due
to the intrinsic simplifications, neglecting asperity coalescence and
interaction effects. However, the issue of Gaussianity has not been proved or
experimentally verified in many cases, and here we show that, for example,
assuming a Weibull distribution of asperity heigths, the area-load linear
coefficient is not much affected, while the relationships load-separation and
therefore also stiffness-load do change largely, particularly when considering
bounded distributions of asperity heigths. It is suggested that Gaussianity of

sophisticated rough contact models based on the Gaussian assumption.

  Instrumentation and Methods in Physics Research A",,"10.1016/j.nima.2016.02.069",,"physics.ins-det nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work reports on a new reconstruction algorithm allowing to reconstruct
the decays of ortho-positronium atoms into three photons using the places and
times of photons recorded in the detector. The method is based on trilateration
and allows for a simultaneous reconstruction of both location and time of the
decay. Results of resolution tests of the new reconstruction in the J-PET
detector based on Monte Carlo simulations are presented, which yield a spatial
resolution at the level of 2 cm (FWHM) for X and Y and at the level of 1 cm
(FWHM) for Z available with the present resolution of J-PET after application
of a kinematic fit. Prospects of employment of this method for studying angular
correlations of photons in decays of polarized ortho-positronia for the needs
of tests of CP and CPT discrete symmetries are also discussed. The new
reconstruction method allows for discrimination of background from random
three-photon coincidences as well as for application of a novel method for
determination of the linear polarization of ortho-positronium atoms, which is
also introduced in this work.

non-uniform equilibrium nematic phase that presents a spontaneous bend with a
precession of the nematic director, $\textbf{n}$, on a conical helix with a
tilt angle $\theta$ and helical pitch $P$. The stability of the $\rm N_{tb}$
phase has been recently demonstrated from the elastic point of view by
extending the Frank elastic energy density of the nematic phase to include the
symmetry element of helical axis, $\bf t$. In the present communication, we
investigate the influence of an external bulk field (magnetic or electric) on
the pitch of the $\rm N_{tb}$ phase. For a material with positive magnetic
susceptibility anisotropy, when the magnetic field $\bf{H}$ is parallel to the
helical axis, $\bf{t}$, the field modifies the coupling parameter between the
director and the helical axis, thus shifting the interval of values for which
this coupling results in the $\rm N_{tb}$ phase. If $\bf{H}$ is perpendicular
to $\bf{t}$, it is shown that the pitch of the nematic director $\bf n$
precession increases with $\bf{H}$, and at a critical value of $H_c$ it becomes
infinite as in a cholesteric liquid crystal, that is, one gets a uniform
orientation of n. Our results include the behaviour of a cholesteric under
field as a limiting case.

calculate their masses using the color-spin interaction. In specific, the
hyperfine masses of the color-spin interaction are calculated for the possible
states in spin-0, spin-1, spin-2 channels. The two states in spin-0 channel as
well as the two states in spin-1 channel are diagonalized in order to generate
the physical hyperfine masses. By matching the difference in hyperfine masses
with the splitting in corresponding hadron masses and using the $X(3872)$ mass
as an input, we estimate the masses corresponding to the states $J^{PC}=0^{++},
1^{+-},2^{++}$. We find the masses of two states in $1^{+-}$ are close to those
of $X(3823)$, $X(3900)$, and the mass of the $2^{++}$ state is close to that of
$X(3940)$. For them, the discrepancies are about $\sim 10$ MeV. This may
suggest that the quantum numbers of the controversial states are
$X(3823)=1^{+-}, X(3900)=1^{+-}, X(3940)=2^{++}$. In this work, we use the same
inputs parameters, the constituent quark masses and the strength of the
color-spin interaction, that have been adopted in the previous work on the $D$
or $B$-meson excited states. There, it was shown that the four-quark structure
can be manifested in their excited states. Thus, our results in this work
provide a consistent treatment on open- and hidden-charm mesons as far as the
four-quark model is concerned.

seconds to $\sim$1 year, using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) at 182 MHz.
Down to a detection threshold of 0.285 Jy, no transient candidates were
identified, making this the most constraining low-frequency survey to date and
placing a limit on the surface density of transients of $<4.1 \times 10^{-7}$
deg$^{-2}$ for the shortest timescale considered. At these frequencies,
emission from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is expected to be detectable in the
shortest timescale images without any corrections for interstellar or
intergalactic dispersion. At an FRB limiting flux density of 7980 Jy, we find a
rate of $<$82 FRBs per sky per day for dispersion measures $<$700 pc cm$^{-3}$.
Assuming a cosmological population of standard candles, our rate limits are
consistent with the FRB rates obtained by Thornton et al. (2013) if they have a
flat spectral slope. Finally, we conduct an initial variability survey of
sources in the field with flux densities $\gtrsim$0.5 Jy and identify no
sources with significant variability in their lightcurves. However, we note
that substantial further work is required to fully characterise both the short
term and low level variability within this field.

called primitive if there exist indices $i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_m$ such that
$M_{i_1} M_{i_2} \ldots M_{i_m}$ is positive (i.e. has all its entries $>0$).
The length of the shortest such product is called the exponent of
$\mathcal{M}$. The concept of primitive sets of matrices comes up in a number
of problems within control theory, non-homogeneous Markov chains, automata
theory etc. Recently, connections between synchronizing automata and primitive
sets of matrices were established. In the present paper, we significantly
strengthen these links by providing equivalence results, both in terms of
combinatorial characterization, and computational aspects. We study the maximal
exponent among all primitive sets of $n \times n$ matrices, which we denote by
$\exp(n)$. We prove that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \tfrac{\log \exp(n)}{n} =
\tfrac{\log 3}{3}$, and moreover, we establish that this bound leads to a
resolution of the \v{C}ern\'{y} problem for carefully synchronizing automata.
We also study the set of matrices with no zero rows and columns, denoted by
$\mathcal{NZ}$, due to its intriguing connections to the \v{C}ern\'{y}
conjecture and the recent generalization of Perron-Frobenius theory for this
class. We characterize computational complexity of different problems related
to the exponent of $\mathcal{NZ}$ matrix sets, and present a quadratic bound on
the exponents of sets belonging to a special subclass. Namely, we show that the
exponent of a set of matrices having total support is bounded by $2n^2 -5n +5$.

decomposition. Compared to conventional, space-only domain decomposition, it
communicates similar amount of data, but in fewer messages. The swept rule
achieves this by decomposing space and time among computing nodes in ways that
exploit the domains of influence and the domain of dependency, making it
possible to communicate once per many time steps with no redundant computation.
By communicating less often, the swept rule effectively breaks the latency
barrier, advancing on average more than one time step per ping-pong latency of
the network. The article presents simple theoretical analysis to the
performance of the swept rule in two spatial dimensions, and supports the
analysis with numerical experiments.

set of target states and positive integer costs associated with every
transition. The traditional optimization objective (stochastic shortest path)
asks to minimize the expected total cost until the target set is reached. We
extend the traditional framework of POMDPs to model energy consumption, which
represents a hard constraint. The energy levels may increase and decrease with
transitions, and the hard constraint requires that the energy level must remain
positive in all steps till the target is reached. First, we present a novel
algorithm for solving POMDPs with energy levels, developing on existing POMDP
solvers and using RTDP as its main method. Our second contribution is related
to policy representation. For larger POMDP instances the policies computed by
existing solvers are too large to be understandable. We present an automated
procedure based on machine learning techniques that automatically extracts
important decisions of the policy allowing us to compute succinct human
readable policies. Finally, we show experimentally that our algorithm performs
well and computes succinct policies on a number of POMDP instances from the
literature that were naturally enhanced with energy levels.

respect to different features, such as the expected completion time, would
allow business managers to timely counteract to undesired situations, in order

of running business process instances would be a very helpful aid when managing
processes, especially under service level agreement constraints. However,
making such accurate forecasts is not easy: many factors may influence the
predicted features.
  Many approaches have been proposed to cope with this problem but all of them
assume that the underling process is stationary. However, in real cases this
assumption is not always true. In this work we present new methods for
predicting the remaining time of running cases. In particular we propose a
method, assuming process stationarity, which outperforms the state-of-the-art

non-stationary processes. We also describe an approach able to predict the full
sequence of activities that a running case is going to take. All these methods

  C) have been present since the initial version",,,,"cs.GT cs.DS cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a ubiquitous scenario in the Internet economy when individual
decision-makers (henceforth, agents) both produce and consume information as
they make strategic choices in an uncertain environment. This creates a
three-way tradeoff between exploration (trying out insufficiently explored
alternatives to help others in the future), exploitation (making optimal
decisions given the information discovered by other agents), and incentives of
the agents (who are myopically interested in exploitation, while preferring the
others to explore). We posit a principal who controls the flow of information
from agents that came before, and strives to coordinate the agents towards a
socially optimal balance between exploration and exploitation, not using any
monetary transfers. The goal is to design a recommendation policy for the
principal which respects agents' incentives and minimizes a suitable notion of
regret.
  We extend prior work in this direction to allow the agents to interact with
one another in a shared environment: at each time step, multiple agents arrive
to play a Bayesian game, receive recommendations, choose their actions, receive
their payoffs, and then leave the game forever. The agents now face two sources
of uncertainty: the actions of the other agents and the parameters of the
uncertain game environment.
  Our main contribution is to show that the principal can achieve constant
regret when the utilities are deterministic (where the constant depends on the
prior distribution, but not on the time horizon), and logarithmic regret when
the utilities are stochastic. As a key technical tool, we introduce the concept
of explorable actions, the actions which some incentive-compatible policy can
recommend with non-zero probability. We show how the principal can identify
(and explore) all explorable actions, and use the revealed information to
perform optimally.

  based on first order phase transition",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The site reduction of U(1) lattice gauge theory is used to model the 0-branes
in the dual theory. The reduced theory is the 1D plane-rotator model of the
angle-valued coordinates on discrete world-line. The energy spectrum is
obtained exactly via the transfer-matrix method, with a minimum in the lowest
energy as a direct consequence of compact nature of coordinates. Below the
critical coupling $g_c=1.125$ and temperature $T_c=0.335$ the system undergoes
a first order phase transition between coexistent phases with lower and higher
gauge couplings. The possible relation between the model and the proposed role
for magnetic monopoles in confinement mechanism based on dual Meissner effect
is pointed.

physics in the US reach pre-teen girls through senior women. Programs exist at
both the local and national levels. In addition, researchers have investigated
issues related to gender equity in physics and physics education. Anecdotal
evidence suggests increased media coverage of the underrepresentation of women
in science. All of these efforts are both motivated and made more effective by
the collection and presentation of data on the presence, persistence, and
promise of women in physics.

with pure acoustic information without recognizing accented speech. This work
combines phonetic knowledge such as vowels with acoustic information to build
Guassian Mixture Model (GMM) classifier with Perceptual Linear Predictive (PLP)
features, optimized by Hetroscedastic Linear Discriminant Analysis (HLDA). With
input about 20-second accented speech, this system achieves classification rate
of 51% on a 7-way classification system focusing on the major types of accents
in English, which is competitive to the state-of-the-art results in this field.
