problem in the model where each of the $n$ nodes of a graph receives a row of
the adjacency matrix, and broadcasts a single sublinear size message to all

called the broadcast congested clique. Specifically, we exhibit a deterministic
protocol that computes the connected components of the input graph in $\lceil

adsorption which involves an unusual clam shell-like `unhinging' of the protein
at an interface. Interestingly, there is no concomitant denaturation of the
secondary structural elements of Rsn-2 with the large scale transformation of
its tertiary structure. In this work we use both experiment and simulation to
better understand the driving forces underpinning this unusual process. We
develop a modified G\={o}-model approach where we have included explicit
representation of the side-chains in order to realistically model the
interaction between the secondary structure elements of the protein and the
interface. Doing so allows for the study of the underlying energy landscape
which governs the mechanism of Rsn-2 interfacial adsorption. Experimentally, we
study targeted mutants of Rsn-2, using the Langmuir trough, pendant drop
tensiometry and circular dichroism, to demonstrate that the clam-shell model is
correct. We find that Rsn-2 adsorption is in fact a two-step process: the
hydrophobic N-terminal tail recruits the protein to the interface after which
Rsn-2 undergoes an unfolding transition which maintains its secondary
structure. Intriguingly, our simulations show that the conformation Rsn-2
adopts at an interface is an arrested state along the denaturation pathway.
More generally, our computational model should prove a useful, and
computationally efficient, tool in studying the dynamics and energetics of
protein-interface interactions.

Shao's (2011) dependent wild bootstrap is valid for a much larger class of
processes than originally considered. It is also valid for residuals from a
general class of parametric models as long as the bootstrap is applied to a
first order expansion of the sample correlation. We prove the bootstrap
validity without exploiting extreme value theory (standard in the literature)
or recent Gaussian approximation theory. Finally, we extend Escanciano and
Lobato's (2009) automatic maximum lag selection to our setting with an
unbounded choice set, and find it works strikingly well in controlled

weight average molecular weights $5 < M_\textrm{w} < 490$ kg/mol. Flow dynamics
and rim morphology of dewetting holes were captured using optical and atomic
force microscopy. Slip properties are assessed in the framework of hydrodynamic
models describing the rim height profile of dewetting holes. We show that short
chains with $M_\textrm{w}$ below the polymer critical molecular weight for
entanglements, $M_\textrm{c}$, can play an important role in slip of highly
entangled polymers. Among mixtures of the same $M_\textrm{w}$, those containing
chains with $M<M_\textrm{c}$ exhibit larger slip lengths as the number average
molecular weight, $M_\textrm{n}$, decreases. The slip enhancement effect is
only applicable when chains with $M<M_\textrm{c}$ are mixed with highly
entangled chains such that the content of the long chain component,
$\phi_\textrm{L}$, is dominant ($\phi_\textrm{L}<0.5$). These results suggest
that short chains affect slip of highly entangled polymers on non-wetting
surfaces due to the physical or chemical disparities of end groups, and any
associated dynamical effect their presence may have, as compared to the
backbone units. The enhanced slip in this regard is attributed to the impact of
chain end groups or short chain enrichment on the effective interfacial
friction coefficient. Accordingly, for entangled PS, a higher concentration of
end groups or short chains at the interface results in a lower effective
friction coefficient which consequently enhances the slip length.

regularisation for heavy quarks. Within the framework of quenched QCD with the
tree-level improved Symanzik gauge action we identify the DWF parameters which
minimise discretisation effects. We find the corresponding effective 4$d$
overlap operator to be exponentially local, independent of the quark mass. We
determine a maximum bare heavy quark mass of $am_h\approx 0.4$, below which the
approximate chiral symmetry and O(a)-improvement of DWF are sustained. This
threshold appears to be largely independent of the lattice spacing. Based on
these findings, we carried out a detailed scaling study for the heavy-strange
meson dispersion relation and decay constant on four ensembles with lattice
spacings in the range $2.0-5.7\,\mathrm{GeV}$. We observe very mild $a^2$
scaling towards the continuum limit. Our findings establish a sound basis for

the driving of the system. We develop a framework which allows to quantify the
role that limited control over the system has on the performance. Specifically,
we show that optimizing the driving entering the work extraction for a given
temperature protocol leads to a universal, one-parameter dependence for both
maximum efficiency and maximum power as a function of efficiency. In
particular, we show that reaching Carnot efficiency (and, hence, Curzon-Ahlborn
efficiency at maximum power) requires to have control over the amplitude of the
full Hamiltonian of the system. Since the kinetic energy cannot be controlled
by an external parameter, heat engines based on underdamped dynamics can
typically not reach Carnot efficiency. We illustrate our general theory with a
paradigmatic case study of a heat engine consisting of an underdamped charged
particle in a modulated two-dimensional harmonic trap in the presence of a

observing the surface composition of long-lived very iron-poor stars born

interesting clues on physical processes having occurred in the first stars can
be obtained just based on nuclear aspects. Two facts are particularly clear, 1)
in these first massive stars, mixing must have occurred between the H-burning
and the He-burning zone during their nuclear lifetimes; 2) only the outer
layers of these massive stars have enriched the material from which the very
iron-poor stars, observed today in the halo, have formed. These two basic
requirements can be obtained by rotating stellar models at very low
metallicity. In the present paper, we discuss the arguments supporting this

have an obvious topological interpretation. As is shown in the present paper,
it appears naturally where in the classical proof that sequentially continuous

whether the witness condition appears in the general continuity theorem only

motivated by biological reasoning and experiments, and possibly by hardware

deviations analysis which unveiled the existence of peculiar dense regions in
the space of synaptic states which accounts for the possibility of learning
efficiently in networks with binary synapses. We extend the analysis to
synapses with multiple states and generally more plausible biological features.
The results clearly indicate that the overall qualitative picture is unchanged
with respect to the binary case, and very robust to variation of the details of
the model. We also provide quantitative results which suggest that the
advantages of increasing the synaptic precision (i.e.~the number of internal
synaptic states) rapidly vanish after the first few bits, and therefore that,
for practical applications, only few bits may be needed for near-optimal
performance, consistently with recent biological findings. Finally, we
demonstrate how the theoretical analysis can be exploited to design efficient

multiple, infinitely wide hidden layers. DGPs are nonparametric probabilistic
models and as such are arguably more flexible, have a greater capacity to
generalise, and provide better calibrated uncertainty estimates than
alternative deep models. This paper develops a new approximate Bayesian
learning scheme that enables DGPs to be applied to a range of medium to large
scale regression problems for the first time. The new method uses an
approximate Expectation Propagation procedure and a novel and efficient
extension of the probabilistic backpropagation algorithm for learning. We
evaluate the new method for non-linear regression on eleven real-world
datasets, showing that it always outperforms GP regression and is almost always
better than state-of-the-art deterministic and sampling-based approximate
inference methods for Bayesian neural networks. As a by-product, this work
provides a comprehensive analysis of six approximate Bayesian methods for
training neural networks.

of the fraction of attributable risk (FAR) or the risk ratio (RR) and
associated confidence intervals. Many such analyses use climate model output to
characterize extreme event behavior with and without anthropogenic influence.
However, such climate models may have biases in their representation of extreme
events. To account for discrepancies in the probabilities of extreme events
between observational datasets and model datasets, we demonstrate an
appropriate rescaling of the model output based on the quantiles of the
datasets to estimate an adjusted risk ratio. Our methodology accounts for
various components of uncertainty in estimation of the risk ratio. In
particular, we present an approach to construct a one-sided confidence interval
on the lower bound of the risk ratio when the estimated risk ratio is infinity.
We demonstrate the methodology using the summer 2011 central US heatwave and

Coulomb phase, having free massless photons, from a strong coupling phase.
However, the phase transition was found to be of first order, ruling out any
nontrivial theory resulting from a continuum limit from the strong coupling
side. In this work, a compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory is studied with
addition of a dimension-two mass counterterm and a higher derivative (HD) term
that ensures a unique vacuum and produces a covariant gauge-fixing term in the
naive continuum limit. For a reasonably large coefficient of the HD term, now
there exists a continuous transition from a regular ordered phase to a
spatially modulated ordered phase. For weak gauge couplings, a continuum limit
from the regular ordered phase results in a familiar theory consisting of free
massless photons. For strong gauge couplings with $g\ge {\cal{O}}(1)$, this
transition changes from first order to continuous as the coefficient of the HD
term is increased, resulting in tricritical points which appear to be a
candidate in this theory for a possible nontrivial continuum limit.

in 2005. A relevant further step was achieved in 2005 when the possibility was
advanced that they could reflect an entire infinite algebra based on
combinations of the self-dual relations $q \to 2-q$ ({\it additive duality})
and $q \to 1/q$ ({\it multiplicative duality}). The entire algebra collapses
into the single fixed point $q=1$, corresponding to the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy
and statistical mechanics. For $q \ne 1$, an infinite set of indices $q$
appears, corresponding in principle to an infinite number of physical
properties of a given complex system describable in terms of the so called
$q$-statistics. The basic idea that is put forward is that, for a given
universality class of systems, a small number (typically one or two) of
independent $q$ indices exist, the infinite others being obtained from these
few ones by simply using the relations of the algebra. The $q$-triplets appear
to constitute a few central elements of the algebra. During the last decade, an
impressive amount of $q$-triplets have been exhibited in analytical,
computational, experimental and observational results in natural, artificial
and social systems. Some of them do satisfy the available algebra constructed
solely with the additive and multiplicative dualities, but some others seem to
violate it. In the present work we generalize those two dualities with the hope
that a wider set of systems can be handled within. The basis of the
generalization is given by the {\it selfdual} relation $q \to q_a(q) \equiv
\frac{(a+2) -aq}{a-(a-2)q} \,\, (a \in {\cal R})$. We verify that $q_a(1)=1$,
and that $q_2(q)=2-q$ and $q_0(q)=1/q$. To physically motivate this
generalization, we briefly review illustrative applications of $q$-statistics,
in order to exhibit possible candidates where the present generalized algebras
could be useful.

contemporary condensed matter physics. When crystallization is bypassed by
rapid cooling, a supercooled liquid, retaining amorphous particle arrangment,
results. The physical phenomenology of supercooled liquids is as vast as it is
interesting. Most significant, the viscosity of the supercooled liquid displays
an incredible increase over a narrow temperature range. Eventually, the
supercooled liquid ceases to flow, becomes a glass, and gains rigidity and
solid-like behaviors. Understanding what underpins the monumental growth of
viscosity, and how rigidity results without long range order is a long-sought
goal. Many theories of the glassy slowdown require the growth of static
lengthscale related to structure with lowering of the temperature. To that end,
we have proposed a new, natural lengthscale- ""the shear penetration depth"".
This lengthscale quantifies the structural connectivity of the supercooled
liquid. The shear penetration depth is defined as the distance up to which a
shear perturbation applied to the boundary propagates into the liquid. We
provide numerical data, based on the simulations of $NiZr_2$, illustrating that

approach to the glass transition. We further discuss this in relation to

discovered by LIGO (GW150914), using a combination of the Pan-STARRS1
wide-field telescope and the PESSTO spectroscopic follow-up programme. As the
final LIGO sky maps changed during analysis, the total probability of the
source being spatially coincident with our fields was finally only 4.2 per
cent. Therefore we discuss our results primarily as a demonstration of the
survey capability of Pan-STARRS and spectroscopic capability of PESSTO. We
mapped out 442 square degrees of the northern sky region of the initial map. We
discovered 56 astrophysical transients over a period of 41 days from the
discovery of the source. Of these, 19 were spectroscopically classified and a
further 13 have host galaxy redshifts. All transients appear to be fairly
normal supernovae and AGN variability and none is obviously linked with
GW150914. We illustrate the sensitivity of our survey by defining parameterised
lightcurves with timescales of 4, 20 and 40 days and use the sensitivity of the
Pan-STARRS1 images to set limits on the luminosities of possible sources. The
Pan-STARRS1 images reach limiting magnitudes of i = 19.2, 20.0 and 20.8
respectively for the three timescales. For long timescale parameterised
lightcurves (with FWHM=~40d) we set upper limits of M_i <= -17.2 -0.9/+1.4 if
the distance to GW150914 is D = 400 +/- 200Mpc. The number of type Ia SN we
find in the survey is similar to that expected from the cosmic SN rate,
indicating a reasonably complete efficiency in recovering supernova like
transients out to D = 400 +/- 200 Mpc.

of Nash-Stampacchia equilibrium points is introduced via variational
inequalities on Riemannian manifolds. Characterizations, existence, and
stability of Nash-Stampacchia equilibria are studied when the strategy sets are
compact/noncompact geodesic convex subsets of Hadamard manifoleds, exploiting
two well-known geometrical features of these spaces both involving the metric
projection map. These properties actually characterize the {non-positivity} of
the sectional curvature of complete and simply connected Riemannian spaces,
delimiting the Hadamard manifolds as the optimal geometrical framework of
Nash-Stampacchia equilibrium problems. Our analytical approach exploits various
elements from set-valued and variational analysis, dynamical systems, and
non-smooth calculus on Riemannian manifolds. Examples are presented on the
Poincar\'e upper-plane model and on the open convex cone of symmetric positive
definite matrices endowed with the trace-type Killing form.

With an equivalent isotropic energy output of $8.5\times10^{53}$ erg and
redshift $z=0.34$, it uniquely combined very high energetics with a relative
proximity to Earth. As a consequence, its X-ray afterglow has been detected by
sensitive X-ray observatories such as XMM-Newton and Chandra for a
record-breaking baseline longer than 80 million seconds. We present the X-ray

power-law decay with a slope $\alpha = 1.309 \pm 0.007$ over more than three

a few models proposed so far to interpret GRB 130427A, and more in general the
significance of this outcome in the context of the standard forward shock
model. We find that this model has difficulty in explaining our data, in both

the resulting two transmission channels, one where the spins of both members of

the current is a periodic function of the strength of the spin-orbit

an identical effect appears due to strain-induced spin-orbit coupling. In
contrast, no spin-orbit induced interference effect can influence the current
through a single weak link connecting two normal metals.

spin-dependent Shockley-Read-Hall recombination in a semiconductor in a
magnetic field at an arbitrary angle between the field and circularly polarized
exciting beam. The experiments are performed at room temperature in GaAsN
alloys where deep paramagnetic centers are responsible for the spin-dependent
recombination. The observed magnetic-field dependences of the circular
polarization r(B) and intensity J(B) of photoluminescence can be approximately
described as a superposition of two Lorentzian contours, normal and inverted,
with their half-widths differing by an order of magnitude. The normal (narrow)
Lorentzian contour is associated with depolarization of the transverse (to the
field) component of spin polarization of the localized electrons, whereas the
inverted (broad) Lorentzian is due to suppression of the hyperfine interaction
of the localized electron with the defect nucleus. The ratio between the height
of one Lorentzian and depth of the other is governed by the field tilt angle.
In contrast to the hyperfine interaction of a shallow-donor-bound electron with
a large number of nuclei of the crystal lattice, in the optical orientation of
the electron-nuclear system under study no additional narrow peak appears in
the oblique field. This result demonstrates that in the GaAsN alloys the
hyperfine interaction of the localized electron with the single nucleus of the
paramagnetic center remains strong even at room temperature. For a theoretical
description of the experiment, we have extended the theory of spin-dependent
recombination via deep paramagnetic centers with the nuclear angular momentum I
= 1/2 developed previously for the particular case of the longitudinal field.
The calculated curves r(B), J(B) agree with the approximate description of the
experimental dependences as a sum of two Lorentzians.

only a few diquark and dilepton models can explain the observed diphoton cross
section without conflicting the experimental mass bounds. When we take
vector-like fermions for the new particles, we find rather different situations
depending on whether their couplings to $X$ are scalar or pseudoscalar type. In
the former case, a few models are allowed if we introduce only one species of
fermions. The more fermions we introduce, the more models are allowed. In the
later case, the most of the models are allowed because of the large coupling
between $X$ and photon. It is interesting that the allowed mass regions of the

2012Ap.....55..536A, which uses the locally-dependent shapes of eclipses in an
addition to the trigonometric polynomial of the second order (which typically
describes the ""out-of-eclipse"" part of the light curve with effects of
reflection, ellipticity and O'Connell). Eclipsing binary stars are believed to
show distinct eclipses only if belonging to the EA type. With a decreasing
eclipse width, the statistically optimal value of the trigonometric polynomial
s (2003ASPC..292..391A) drastically increases from ~2 for elliptic (EL)
variables without eclipses, ~6-8 for EW and up to ~30-50 for some EA with
narrow eclipses. In this case of large number of parameters, the smoothing
curve becomes very noisy and apparent waves (the Gibbs phenomenon) may be seen.
The NAV set of the parameters may be used for classification in the GCVS, VSX
and similar catalogs. The maximal number of parameters is m=12, which
corresponds to s=5, if correcting both the period and the initial epoch. We
have applied the method to few stars, also in a case of multi-color photometry
(2015JASS...32..127A), when it is possible to use the phenomenological
parameters from the NAV fit to estimate physical parameters using statistical
dependencies. We conclude that the NAV approximation is better than the TP one
even for the case of EW-type stars with much wider eclipses. It may also be
used to determine timings (see 2005ASPC..335...37A for a review of methods) or
to determine parameters in the case of variable period, using a complete light
curve modeling the phase variations. The method is illustrated on 2MASS
J11080447-6143290 (EA-type), USNO-B1.0 1265-0306001 and USNO-B1.0 1266-0313413

vertices of two graphs such that, if two nodes are connected in the first
graph, their images are connected in the second graph. This problem arises in
many fields such as computational biology, social sciences, and computer vision
and is often cast as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP). Most standard graph
alignment methods consider an optimization that maximizes the number of matches
between the two graphs, ignoring the effect of mismatches. We propose a
generalized graph alignment formulation that considers both matches and
mismatches in a standard QAP formulation. This modification can have a major
impact in aligning graphs with different sizes and heterogenous edge densities.
Moreover, we propose two methods for solving the generalized graph alignment
problem based on spectral decomposition of matrices. We compare the performance
of proposed methods with some existing graph alignment algorithms including
Natalie2, GHOST, IsoRank, NetAlign, Klau's approach as well as a semidefinite
programming-based method over various synthetic and real graph models. Our
proposed method based on simultaneous alignment of multiple eigenvectors leads
to consistently good performance in different graph models. In particular, in
the alignment of regular graph structures which is one of the most difficult
graph alignment cases, our proposed method significantly outperforms other
methods.

to leverage transistors when they cannot all be used at the same time. In
modern SOCs, these transistors are often used to create specialized
accelerators which improve energy efficiency for some applications by 10-1000X.
While this might seem like the magic bullet we need, for most CPU applications
more energy is dissipated in the memory system than in the processor: these
large gains in efficiency are only possible if the DRAM and memory hierarchy
are mostly idle. We refer to this desirable state as Dark Memory, and it only
occurs for applications with an extreme form of locality.
  To show our findings, we introduce Pareto curves in the energy/op and
mm$^2$/(ops/s) metric space for compute units, accelerators, and on-chip
memory/interconnect. These Pareto curves allow us to solve the power,
performance, area constrained optimization problem to determine which
accelerators should be used, and how to set their design parameters to optimize
the system. This analysis shows that memory accesses create a floor to the
achievable energy-per-op. Thus high performance requires Dark Memory, which in
turn requires co-design of the algorithm for parallelism and locality, with the
hardware.

storage material with exceptional hydrogen densities by weight and volume and a
low hydrogen desorption temperature. But, unfortunately, its production of
diborane (B$_2$H$_6$) gases upon heating to release the hydrogen restricts its
practical use. To elucidate this issue, we investigate the properties of a
number of metal borohydrides with the same problem and find that the
electronegativity of the metal cation is not the best descriptor of diborane
production. We show that, instead, the closely related formation enthalpy is a
better descriptor and we find that diborane production is an exponential
function thereof. We conclude that diborane production is sufficiently
suppressed for formation enthalpies of $-$80 kJ/mol BH$_4$ or lower, providing
specific design guidelines to tune existing metal borohydrides or synthesize
new ones. We then use first-principles methods to study the effects of Sc
alloying in Al(BH$_4$)$_3$. Our results for the thermodynamic properties of the
Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$(BH$_4$)$_3$ alloy clearly show the stabilizing effect of Sc
alloying and thus the suppression of diborane production. We conclude that
stabilizing Al(BH$_4$)$_3$ and similar borohydrides via alloying or other means
is a promising route to suppress diborane production and thus develop viable
hydrogen storage materials.

optimization tasks, i.e. problems characterized by a discrete search space. In
particular, we focus on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), i.e. a famous
problem whose search space grows exponentially, increasing the number of
cities, up to becoming NP-hard. The solutions of the TSP can be codified by
arrays of cities, and can be evaluated by fitness, computed according to a cost
function (e.g. the length of a path). Our method is based on the evolution of
an agent population by means of an imitative mechanism, we define `partial
imitation'. In particular, agents receive a random solution and then,
interacting among themselves, may imitate the solutions of agents with a higher
fitness. Since the imitation mechanism is only partial, agents copy only one
entry (randomly chosen) of another array (i.e. solution). In doing so, the
population converges towards a shared solution, behaving like a spin system
undergoing a cooling process, i.e. driven towards an ordered phase. We
highlight that the adopted `partial imitation' mechanism allows the population
to generate solutions over time, before reaching the final equilibrium. Results
of numerical simulations show that our method is able to find, in a finite
time, both optimal and suboptimal solutions, depending on the size of the
considered search space.

initial probability distribution for their energy and opening angle as in
proton-proton (pp) collisions, as they propagate through an expanding cooling
droplet of strongly coupled plasma as in heavy ion collisions. We identify two
competing effects: (i) each individual jet widens as it propagates; (ii) the
opening angle distribution for jets emerging from the plasma within any
specified range of energies has been pushed toward smaller angles, comparing to
pp jets with the same energies. The second effect arises because small-angle
jets suffer less energy loss and because jets with a higher initial energy are
less probable in the ensemble. We illustrate both effects in a simple
two-parameter model, and find that their consequence in sum is that the opening
angle distribution for jets in any range of energies contains fewer narrow and
wide jets. Either effect can dominate in the mean opening angle, for not
unreasonable values of the parameters. So, the mean opening angle for jets with
a given energy can easily shift toward smaller angles, as experimental data may
indicate, even while every jet in the ensemble broadens.

gravitational wave event GW150914, the first trigger from the Advanced LIGO
gravitational wave detectors. We used the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to image a
102 deg$^2$ area, corresponding to 38% of the initial trigger high-probability
sky region and to 11% of the revised high-probability region. We observed in i
and z bands at 4-5, 7, and 24 days after the trigger. The median $5\sigma$
point-source limiting magnitudes of our search images are i=22.5 and z=21.8
mag. We processed the images through a difference-imaging pipeline using
templates from pre-existing Dark Energy Survey data and publicly available
DECam data. Due to missing template observations and other losses, our
effective search area subtends 40 deg$^{2}$, corresponding to 12% total
probability in the initial map and 3% of the final map. In this area, we search
for objects that decline significantly between days 4-5 and day 7, and are
undetectable by day 24, finding none to typical magnitude limits of i=
21.5,21.1,20.1 for object colors (i-z)=1,0,-1, respectively. Our search
demonstrates the feasibility of a dedicated search program with DECam and bodes
well for future research in this emerging field.

radiation. While this process will usually produce a luminous supernova, the
optical signatue could be subluminous and a direct collapse to a black hole,
with the star just disappearing, is possible. The gravitational wave event
GW150914 reported by the LIGO Virgo Collaboration (LVC) on 2015 September 16,
was detected by a burst analysis and whose high probability spatial
localization included the Large Magellanic Cloud. Shortly after the
announcement of the event, we used the Dark Energy Camera to observe 102
deg$^2$ of the localization area, including a 38 deg$^2$ area centered on the
LMC. Using a catalog of 152 LMC luminous red supergiants, candidates to undergo
a core collapse without a visible supernova, we find that the positions of 144
of these are inside our images, and that all are detected - none have
disappeared. There are other classes of candidates: we searched existing
catalogs of red supergiants, yellow supergiants, Wolf-Rayet stars, and luminous
blue variable stars, recovering all that were inside the imaging area. Based on
our observations, we conclude that it is unlikely that GW150914 was caused by
the core collapse of a supergiant in the LMC, consistent with the LIGO
Collaboration analyses of the gravitational wave form as best described by a
binary black hole merger. We discuss how to generalize this search for future
very nearby core collapse candidates.

significantly change from those of MSSM, and the infrared-free nature of the

squark mass to the gluino mass, and scalar trilinear couplings are enhanced at
the low-energy scale. Consequently, even in gaugino mediation models, the Higgs

wireless network with $K_T$ transmitters, each equipped with a local cache of
size of $M_T$ files, and $K_R$ receivers, each equipped with a local cache of
size of $M_R$ files. Each receiver will ask for one of the $N$ files in the
library, which needs to be delivered. The objective is to design the cache
placement (without prior knowledge of receivers' future requests) and the
communication scheme to maximize the throughput of the delivery. In this
setting, we show that the sum degrees-of-freedom (sum-DoF) of
$\min\left\{\frac{K_T M_T+K_R M_R}{N},K_R\right\}$ is achievable, and this is
within a factor of 2 of the optimum, under one-shot linear schemes. This result
shows that (i) the one-shot sum-DoF scales linearly with the aggregate cache
size in the network (i.e., the cumulative memory available at all nodes), (ii)
the transmitters' and receivers' caches contribute equally in the one-shot
sum-DoF, and (iii) caching can offer a throughput gain that scales linearly
with the size of the network.
  To prove the result, we propose an achievable scheme that exploits the
redundancy of the content at transmitters' caches to cooperatively zero-force
some outgoing interference and availability of the unintended content at
receivers' caches to cancel (subtract) some of the incoming interference. We
develop a particular pattern for cache placement that maximizes the overall
gains of cache-aided transmit and receive interference cancellations. For the
converse, we present an integer optimization problem which minimizes the number
of communication blocks needed to deliver any set of requested files to the
receivers. We then provide a lower bound on the value of this optimization
problem, hence leading to an upper bound on the linear one-shot sum-DoF of the
network, which is within a factor of 2 of the achievable sum-DoF.

observation, in this paper we determine the quasi-topological 8D theory which
governs the vacua of 2D N = (0,2) gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) obtained
from compactifications of type I and heterotic strings on a Calabi-Yau

elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fivefold, where matter fields and interaction
terms localize on lower-dimensional subspaces, i.e. defect operators. To cancel
anomalies / cancel tadpoles, these GLSMs must couple to additional chiral
sectors, which in some cases do not admit a known description in terms of a UV

sometimes break supersymmetry due to spacetime filling anti-branes. We also
study various canonical examples such as the standard embedding of heterotic

and SMC) using a low cost telephoto lens with a wide field of view to explore
stellar substructure in the outskirts of the stellar disk of the LMC (r < 10
degrees from the center). These data have higher resolution than existing star
count maps, and highlight the existence of stellar arcs and multiple spiral
arms in the northern periphery, with no comparable counterparts in the South.
We compare these data to detailed simulations of the LMC disk outskirts,
following interactions with its low mass companion, the SMC. We consider
interaction in isolation and with the inclusion of the Milky Way tidal field.
The simulations are used to assess the origin of the northern structures,
including also the low density stellar arc recently identified in the DES data
by Mackey et al. 2015 at ~ 15 degrees. We conclude that repeated close
interactions with the SMC are primarily responsible for the asymmetric stellar
structures seen in the periphery of the LMC. The orientation and density of
these arcs can be used to constrain the LMC's interaction history with and
impact parameter of the SMC. More generally, we find that such asymmetric
structures should be ubiquitous about pairs of dwarfs and can persist for 1-2
Gyr even after the secondary merges entirely with the primary. As such, the
lack of a companion around a Magellanic Irregular does not disprove the
hypothesis that their asymmetric structures are driven by dwarf-dwarf
interactions.

ground states of some spin-chain Hamiltonians: the XY model, the Ising model in
a transverse field (ITF) and the XXZ models. In the XY and ITF cases,
entanglement only takes place between states with opposite momenta. Thus, an
anisotropy in the interaction induces entanglement in the momentum pairs. In
the ITF case, the ferromagnetic phase is characterized by a total entropy
between left- and right-moving modes which is independent on the external
field. This result characterizes the Ising phase transition in momentum space.
In the critical XXZ case, we provide evidence that the maximal entropy between
energy modes around the Fermi point grows logarithmically with the system size,
with a prefactor which depends on the compactification radius. The slow growth
of the entanglement in Fourier space with the system size provides an
explanation for the success of the renormalization techniques in momentum

of He interacting with graphene, and determine how they depend on strain. At
short distances, we find that strain tends to reduce the interaction strength

quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees for delay-sensitive traffic in the downlink
orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) networks. This design is
based on Wu's $\textit{effective capacity}$ (EC) concept [1], which
characterizes the maximum throughput of a system subject to statistical
delay-QoS requirements at the data-link layer. In the particular context
considered, our main contributions consist of quantifying the
$\textit{effective energy-efficiency}$ (EEE)-versus-EC tradeoff and
characterizing the delay-sensitive traffic as a function of the QoS-exponent
$\theta$, which expresses the exponential decay rate of the delay-QoS violation
probabilities. Upon exploiting the properties of fractional programming, the
originally quasi-concave EEE optimization problem having a fractional form is
transformed into a subtractive optimization problem by applying Dinkelbach's
method. As a result, an iterative inner-outer loop based resource allocation
algorithm is conceived for efficiently solving the transformed EEE optimization
problem. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme converges
within a few Dinkelbach algorithm's iterations to the desired solution
accuracy. Furthermore, the impact of the circuitry power, of the QoS-exponent
and of the power amplifier inefficiency is characterized numerically. These
results reveal that the optimally allocated power maximizing the EEE decays
exponentially with respect to both the circuitry power and the QoS-exponent,
whilst decaying linearly with respect to the power amplifier inefficiency.

that the jet was produced due to magnetic reconnection. At the base of the jet,
a fan-spine structure was clearly resolved by the NST, including the spine and

liquid state. One possible explanation of the origin of these anomalies lies in
the existence of a metastable liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) between two
(high and low density) forms of water. While the anomalies are observed in
experiments on bulk and confined water and by computer simulation studies of
water-like models, the existence of a LLPT in water is still debated.
Unambiguous experimental proof of the existence of a LLPT in bulk supercooled
water is hampered by fast ice nucleation which is a precursor of the
hypothesized LLPT. Moreover, the hypothesized LLPT, being metastable, in
principle cannot exist in the thermodynamic limit (infinite size, infinite
time). Therefore, computer simulations of water models are crucial for
exploring the possibility of the metastable LLPT and the nature of the
anomalies. In this work, we present new simulation results in the NVT ensemble
for one of the most accurate classical molecular models of water, TIP4P/2005.
To describe the computed properties and explore the possibility of a LLPT we
have applied two-structure thermodynamics, viewing water as a non-ideal mixture
of two interconvertible local structures (""states""). The results suggest the
presence of a liquid-liquid critical point and a LLPT in this model for the
simulated length and time scales. We have compared the behavior of TIP4P/2005
with other popular water-like models, namely mW and ST2, and with real water,
all of which are well described by two-state thermodynamics. In view of the
current debate involving different studies of TIP4P/2005, we discuss
consequences of metastability and finite size in observing the liquid-liquid
separation. We also address the relationship between the phenomenological order
parameter of two-structure thermodynamics and the microscopic nature of the
low-density structure.

  We study compression algorithms that leverage the relational structure to
compress datasets to a much greater extent. We develop Squish, a system that
uses a combination of Bayesian Networks and Arithmetic Coding to capture
multiple kinds of dependencies among attributes and achieve near-entropy
compression rate. Squish also supports user-defined attributes: users can
instantiate new data types by simply implementing five functions for a new
class interface. We prove the asymptotic optimality of our compression
algorithm and conduct experiments to show the effectiveness of our system:
Squish achieves a reduction of over 50\% in storage size relative to systems
developed in prior work on a variety of real datasets.

additional investigations and possibly prevent future readmissions. This not
only improves the quality of care but also reduces the medical expenses on
readmission. Machine learning methods have been leveraged on public health data
to build a system for identifying diabetic patients facing a high risk of
future readmission. Number of inpatient visits, discharge disposition and
admission type were identified as strong predictors of readmission. Further, it
was found that the number of laboratory tests and discharge disposition
together predict whether the patient will be readmitted shortly after being
discharged from the hospital (i.e. <30 days) or after a longer period of time
(i.e. >30 days). These insights can help healthcare providers to improve
inpatient diabetic care. Finally, the cost analysis suggests that \$252.76

processing and communication with many positive and negative results. Although
it is established that adaptivity does not offer substantial reductions in
minimax mean square error for a fixed number of measurements, existing results
have shown several advantages of adaptivity in complexity of reconstruction,
accuracy of support detection, and gain in signal-to-noise ratio, under
constraints on sensing energy. Sensing energy has often been measured in terms
of the Frobenius Norm of the sensing matrix. This paper uses a different metric
that we call the $l_0$ cost of a sensing matrix-- to quantify the complexity of
sensing. Thus sparse sensing matrices have a lower cost. We derive
information-theoretic lower bounds on the $l_0$ cost that hold for any
non-adaptive sensing strategy. We establish that any non-adaptive sensing
strategy must incur an $l_0$ cost of $\Theta\left( N \log_2(N)\right) $ to
reconstruct an $N$-dimensional, one--sparse signal when the number of
measurements are limited to $\Theta\left(\log_2 (N)\right)$. In comparison,
bisection-type adaptive strategies only require an $l_0$ cost of at most
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ for an equal number of measurements. The problem has an
interesting interpretation as a sphere packing problem in a multidimensional
space, such that all the sphere centres have minimum non-zero co-ordinates. We
also discuss the variation in $l_0$ cost as the number of measurements increase
from $\Theta\left(\log_2 (N)\right)$ to $\Theta\left(N\right)$.

distance scale $\Delta z\simeq U_1/ \Omega _{\mathrm e}$ (first part of the
transition layer), where $\Omega_{\mathrm e}$ is the electron gyro-frequency
and $U_1$ is the upstream speed. This electric field both decelerates the
supersonic ion flow and accelerates the electrons up to high velocities. In
this part of the transition region, the electric forces connected with the
deceleration of the ion flow strongly dominate over the Lorentz forces. We,
therefore, call this part the demagnetization region. In the second phase,
Lorentz forces due to convected magnetic fields compete with the electric
field, and the highly anisotropic and energetic electron distribution function
is converted into a shell distribution with energetic shell electrons storing
about 3/4 of the upstream ion kinetic energy. In the third phase, the plasma
particles thermalize due to the relaxation of free energy by plasma
instabilities. The first part of the transition region opens up a new
thermodynamic degree of freedom never before taken into account for the
electrons, since the electrons are usually considered to be enslaved to follow
the behavior of the protons in all velocity moments like density, bulk
velocity, and temperature. We show that electrons may be the downstream plasma
fluid that dominates the downstream plasma pressure.

the footsteps of~\cite{wong2017lasso}, this paper relies only on (strict)
stationarity and $ \beta $-mixing condition to establish consistency of lasso
when data comes from a $\beta$-mixing process with marginals having subgaussian
tails. Because of the general assumptions, the data can come from DGMs
different than standard time series models such as VAR or ARCH. When the true
DGM is not VAR, the lasso estimates correspond to those of the best linear
predictors using the past observations. We establish non-asymptotic
inequalities for estimation and prediction errors of the lasso estimates.
Together with~\cite{wong2017lasso}, we provide lasso guarantees that cover full
spectrum of the parameters in specifications of $ \beta $-mixing subgaussian
time series. Applications of these results potentially extend to non-Gaussian,
non-Markovian and non-linear times series models as the examples we provide
demonstrate. In order to prove our results, we derive a novel Hanson-Wright

the defects are mainly superparamagnetic clusters for R = Ce, Pr, and Nd with
strong intercluster interactions, implying that defects are locally

fraction correspondingly decreases. The properties of ETGs on galaxy scaling
relations, and in particular the $(M_{\ast}, R_{\rm e})$ diagram, and their
dependence on environment, indicate two main independent channels for galaxy
evolution. Fast rotators ETGs start as star forming disks and evolve trough a
channel dominated by gas accretion, bulge growth and quenching. While slow
rotators assemble near the center of massive halos via intense star formation
at high redshift, and remain as such for the rest of their evolution via a
channel dominated by gas poor mergers. This is consistent with independent

(TMDs) originates from the spin-orbit coupling. Presence of spin-orbit fields
of opposite signs for electrons in K and K' valleys in combination with
possibility of intervalley scattering result in a nontrivial spin dynamics.
This dynamics is reflected in the dependence of nonlocal resistance on external
magnetic field (the Hanle curve). We calculate theoretically the Hanle shape in
TMDs. It appears that, unlike conventional materials without valley asymmetry,
the Hanle shape in TMDs is different for normal and parallel orientations of
the external field. For normal orientation, it has two peaks for slow
intervalley scattering, while, for fast intervalley scattering the shape is
usual. For parallel orientation, the Hanle curve exhibits a cusp at zero field.
This cusp is a signature of a slow-decaying valley-asymmetric mode of the spin
dynamics.

ground-breaking performance in important domains such as computer vision,

significant attention from industry. However, these models require incredible

processing units (GPU) as general purpose processors (GPGPU), the use of field
programmable gate arrays (FPGA) provide an interesting alternative. Current
trends in design tools for FPGAs have made them more compatible with the
high-level software practices typically practiced in the deep learning
community, making FPGAs more accessible to those who build and deploy models.
Since FPGA architectures are flexible, this could also allow researchers the

Fluctuation of the absorbing clouds in the line of sight of the extended X-ray

anti-correlation between the direct (not covered) spectral component and the

for adaptive data analysis. Assuming Gaussianity of queries, we establish the
first sharp minimax lower bound on the squared error in the order of
$O(\frac{\sqrt{k}\sigma^2}{n})$, where $k$ is the number of queries asked, and
$\sigma^2/n$ is the ordinary signal-to-noise ratio for a single query. Our

by overfitting. This approximately least favorable adversary uses only one
level of adaptivity, suggesting that the minimax risk for 1-step adaptivity
with k-1 initial releases and that for $k$-step adaptivity are on the same
order. The key technical component of the lower bound proof is a reduction to
finding the convoluting distribution that optimally obfuscates the sign of a
Gaussian signal. Our lower bound construction also reveals a transparent and
elementary proof of the matching upper bound as an alternative approach to
Russo and Zou (2015), who used information-theoretic tools to provide the same

engine that relies on Bayesian adaptive exploration where the optimal

implies that the measurement outcomes of two incompatible observables can not
be predicted simultaneously. In quantum information theory, this principle can
be expressed in terms of entropic measures. Berta \emph{et al}.
[\href{http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nphys1734}{ Nature Phys. 6, 659
(2010) }] have indicated that uncertainty bound can be altered by considering a
particle as a quantum memory correlating with the primary particle. In this
article, we obtain a lower bound for entropic uncertainty in the presence of a
quantum memory by adding an additional term depending on Holevo quantity and
mutual information. We conclude that our lower bound will be tighten with
respect to that of Berta \emph{et al.}, when the accessible information about
measurements outcomes is less than the mutual information of the joint state.
Some examples have been investigated for which our lower bound is tighter than
the Berta's \emph{et al.} lower bound. Using our lower bound, a lower bound for
the entanglement of formation of bipartite quantum states has obtained, as well
as an upper bound for the regularized distillable common randomness.

of $A[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/\mathfrak{a}$ has several equivalent algorithmic

give a Gr\""obner basis method to compute it for residue class polynomial rings

application of this relation is that it gives a uniform method, the first of

Hilbert polynomials and show that Gr\""obner basis methods can be used to
compute these quantities. We then proceed to show that the combinatorial

datasets is an important problem for intelligent transportation systems and
sustainability. However, it is challenging due to the complex topological
dependencies and high dynamics associated with changing road conditions. In
this paper, we propose a Latent Space Model for Road Networks (LSM-RN) to
address these challenges. In particular, given a series of road network
snapshots, we learn the attributes of vertices in latent spaces which capture
both topological and temporal properties. As these latent attributes are
time-dependent, they can estimate how traffic patterns form and evolve. In
addition, we present an incremental online algorithm which sequentially and
adaptively learn the latent attributes from the temporal graph changes. Our
framework enables real-time traffic prediction by 1) exploiting real-time
sensor readings to adjust/update the existing latent spaces, and 2) training as
data arrives and making predictions on-the-fly with given data. By conducting
extensive experiments with a large volume of real-world traffic sensor data, we
demonstrate the utility superiority of our framework for real-time traffic
prediction on large road networks over competitors as well as a baseline
graph-based LSM.

Previous work has found that under differential privacy, computing multiple
correlated aggregates as a batch, using an appropriate \emph{strategy}, may
yield higher accuracy than computing each of them independently. However,
finding the best strategy that maximizes result accuracy is non-trivial, as it
involves solving a complex constrained optimization program that appears to be
non-linear and non-convex. Hence, in the past much effort has been devoted in
solving this non-convex optimization program. Existing approaches include
various sophisticated heuristics and expensive numerical solutions. None of
them, however, guarantees to find the optimal solution of this optimization
problem.
  This paper points out that under ($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-differential privacy,
the optimal solution of the above constrained optimization problem in search of
a suitable strategy can be found, rather surprisingly, by solving a simple and
elegant convex optimization program. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm
based on Newton's method, which we prove to always converge to the optimal
solution with linear global convergence rate and quadratic local convergence
rate. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the
proposed solution.

Neptune Trojans (NTs) and how they are affected by the planetary migration of

damped during planetary migration, then their eccentricities and inclinations
were higher prior and during migration than their current values. Using test
particle integrations we study the stability of primordial NTs, objects that
were initially Trojans with Neptune prior to migration. We also study
Trans-Neptunian objects captured into resonance with Neptune and becoming NTs
during planet migration. We find that most primordial NTs were unstable and
lost if eccentricity and inclination damping took place during planetary
migration. With damping, secular resonances with Neptune can increase a low
eccentricity and inclination population of Trans-Neptunian objects increasing
the probability that they are captured into 1:1 resonance with Neptune,
becoming high inclination NTs. We suggest that the resonant trapping scenario
is a promising and more effective mechanism explaining the origin of NTs that
is particularly effective if Uranus and Neptune experienced eccentricity and
inclination damping during planetary migration.

theories of gravity in dimension four for spacetimes endowed with two commuting
Killing vector fields. Assuming there is no curvature singularity anywhere on

similar to Einstein's gravity, we must have $T_{ab}k^ak^b=0$ on the Killing
horizon, where $k^a$ is a null geodesic tangent to the horizon. For
axisymmetric spacetimes, the effective gravitational coupling
$\sim\,F'^{-1}(R)$ should usually depend upon the polar coordinate and hence
need not necessarily be a constant on the Killing horizon. We prove that the
surface gravity of such a Killing horizon must be a constant, irrespective of
whether $F'(R)$ is a constant there or not. We next apply these results to
investigate some further basic features. In particular, we show that any hairy
solution for the real massive vector field in such theories is clearly ruled
out, as long as the potential of the scalar field generated in the
corresponding Einstein's frame is a positive definite quantity.

broad-band (0.1-100 keV) X-ray observations are available, the spectral energy
distribution of these sources is usually investigated by adopting pure
phenomenological models, rather than models linked to the physics of accretion.
In this paper, a detailed spectral study of the X-ray emission recorded from
the high-mass X-ray binary pulsars Cen X-3, 4U 0115+63, and Her X-1 is carried
out by using BeppoSAX and joined Suzaku+NuStar data, together with an advanced
version of the compmag model. The latter provides a physical description of the
high energy emission from accreting pulsars, including the thermal and bulk
Comptonization of cyclotron and bremsstrahlung seed photons along the neutron
star accretion column. The compmag model is based on an iterative method for
solving second-order partial differential equations, whose convergence
algorithm has been improved and consolidated during the preparation of this
paper. Our analysis shows that the broad-band X-ray continuum of all considered
sources can be self-consistently described by the compmag model. The cyclotron
absorption features, not included in the model, can be accounted for by using
Gaussian components. From the fits of the compmag model to the data we inferred
the physical properties of the accretion columns in all sources, finding values
reasonably close to those theoretically expected according to our current
understanding of accretion in highly magnetized neutron stars. The updated
version of the compmag model has been tailored to the physical processes that
are known to occur in the columns of highly magnetized accreting neutron stars
and it can thus provide a better understanding of the high energy radiation

nonlinear, dispersive regularization of compressible flow and ideal MHD, in
analogy with the KdV regularization of the 1D kinematic wave equation. This
work extends and significantly generalizes earlier work on incompressible Euler
and ideal MHD. It involves a micro-scale cutoff length lambda which is a
function of density, unlike in the incompressible case. In MHD, it can be taken
to be of order the electron collisionless skin depth c/omega_pe. Our
regularization preserves the symmetries of the original systems, and with
appropriate boundary conditions, leads to associated conservation laws. Energy
and enstrophy are subject to a priori bounds determined by initial data in
contrast to the unregularized systems. A Hamiltonian and Poisson bracket
formulation is developed and applied to generalize the constitutive relation to
bound higher moments of vorticity. A `swirl' velocity field is identified, and
shown to transport w/rho and B/rho, generalizing the Kelvin-Helmholtz and
Alfven theorems. The steady regularized equations are used to model a rotating
vortex, MHD pinch and a plane vortex sheet. The proposed regularization could
facilitate numerical simulations of fluid/MHD equations and provide a
consistent statistical mechanics of vortices/current filaments in 3D, without
blowup of enstrophy. Implications for detailed analyses of fluid and plasma

Rigorous, purely numerical, nonperturbative solutions of this equation are

critical current densities ($\textit{J}_{c}$) that can be further increased

However, these gains are accompanied by increases in the flux creep rate, a
manifestation of competition between the different types of defects. Here, we
study this competition to better understand how to design pinning landscapes
that simultaneously increase $\textit{J}_{c}$ and reduce creep. CCs grown by
metal organic deposition show non-monotonic changes in the
temperature-dependent creep rate, $\textit{S}(\textit{T})$. Notably, in low
fields, there is a conspicuous dip to low $\textit{S}$ as temperature
($\textit{T}$) increases from ~20 K to ~65 K. Oxygen-, proton-, and
Au-irradiation substantially increase $\textit{S}$ in this temperature range.
Focusing on an oxygen-irradiated CC, we investigate the contribution of
different types of irradiation-induced defects to the flux creep rate.
Specifically, we study $\textit{S}(\textit{T})$ as we tune the relative density
of point defects to larger defects by annealing both an as-grown and an
irradiated CC in O$_{2}$ at temperatures $\textit{T}_{A}$ = 250${\deg}$C to
600${\deg}$C. We observe a steady decrease in $\textit{S}$($\textit{T}$ > 20 K)

nanoparticle precipitates in creating the dip in $\textit{S}(\textit{T})$ and
point defects and clusters in increasing $\textit{S}$ at intermediate

Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT). We first look at the
robust design problem of achieving max-min fairness amongst users (in the
worst-case sense). Contrary to the conventional approach adopted in literature,
we propose a rather unorthodox design based on a Rate-Splitting (RS) strategy.
Each user's message is split into two parts, a common part and a private part.
All common parts are packed into one super common message encoded using a
public codebook, while private parts are independently encoded. The resulting
symbol streams are linearly precoded and simultaneously transmitted, and each
receiver retrieves its intended message by decoding both the common stream and
its corresponding private stream. For CSIT uncertainty regions that scale with
SNR (e.g. by scaling the number of feedback bits), we prove that a RS-based
design achieves higher max-min (symmetric) Degrees of Freedom (DoF) compared to
conventional designs (NoRS). For the special case of non-scaling CSIT (e.g.
fixed number of feedback bits), and contrary to NoRS, RS can achieve a
non-saturating max-min rate. We propose a robust algorithm based on the
cutting-set method coupled with the Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (WMMSE)
approach, and we demonstrate its performance gains over state-of-the art
designs. Finally, we extend the RS strategy to address the Quality of Service
(QoS) constrained power minimization problem, and we demonstrate significant
gains over NoRS-based designs.

is the curvature vector, an appropriate Lagrangian has been defined for both
free-field and fields with sources. Solutions to the corresponding field
equations have been developed. In this paper we use the static spherically
symmetric tetrad field with sources to model the universe. Our fundamental
assumption is that the total density comprised of both ordinary and dark matter
should be constant. The resulting model with one adjustable parameter predicts
that ordinary matter is approximately 77\% of the total mass content, but this
percentage is near 0\% for regions near the center of the universe. The space
is approximately isotropic for $r$ near zero. The radial and tangential
pressures are negative and unequal. The redshift is also modeled without the

is given. Equations governing particle motion are also derived which can
produce a repulsive effect and produce even larger redshifts. Finally, the
cosmic microwave background and its anisotropies are addressed and heuristic
arguments are given that suggest that our theory is not inconsistent with these
observations. These results add further confirmation that the theory developed

individual data scientists to all become 'full stack', taking control of their
own destinies from the exploration and research phase, through algorithm
development, experiment setup, and deep experiment analytics. We describe
algorithms tested and deployed in 2015, as well as some key insights obtained
from experiments leading to the launch of the new recommender system at Udemy.
Finally, we outline the current areas of research, which include search,

($\Delta$), can reveal stationarity breaking and coupling between physical
systems. We demonstrate that it is possible to detect small variations in a
dynamical system based only on temporal signal displayed by another system
coupled to it. To introduce basic ideas, we consider a well known dynamical
system composed of two master-slave coupled Lorenz oscillators. We start
evidencing that due to the sensitivity of $\Delta$ computed from temporal time
series of slave oscillator, its is possible to detect the stationary breaking
imposed in the master oscillator. As a second example, the method is carried
out in a real physiological data acquired from accelerometer sensors
($\mathrm{A_{cc}}$) and used to detect micro arousal phenomenology (described
by a sharp burst in $\mathrm{A_{cc}}$ signal) during sleep periods in mice.
Moreover, we show for the first time that making use of recurrence quantifier
it is possible to infer a coupling between electric signals from hippocampus
and ""locomotor brain areas"" of mice, based only on non invasive data from
$\mathrm{A_{cc}}$. Our results suggest new possibilities of analysis of coupled
systems making use of accessible time series. Our second example supports an
interpretation of an internal coupling detectable as a stationarity breaking in
$\mathrm{A_{cc}}$ that occurs some seconds before micro arousal processes
during sleep periods in rodents, contributing to the idea that micro arousals
are elements of sleep taking part in the regulation of sleep process. Such a
characterization of micro arousals can improve our knowledge about sleep
fostering tools of sleep diagnose and pharmacology research for mammals in
general.

  Hypothesis","25 pages; 7 figures",,,,"math-ph math.MP math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The location of zeros of the basic double sum over the square lattice is
studied. This sum can be represented in terms of the product of the Riemann
zeta function and the Dirichlet beta function, so that the assertion that all
its non-trivial zeros lie on the critical line is a particular case of the
Generalised Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). It is shown that a new necessary and
sufficient condition for this special case of the GRH to hold is that a
particular set of equimodular and equiargument contours of a ratio of MacDonald
function double sums intersect only on the critical line. It is further shown
that these contours could only intersect off the critical line on the boundary
of discrete regions of the complex plane called ""inner islands"". Numerical
investigations are described related to this geometrical condition, and it is
shown that for the first ten thousand zeros of both the zeta function and the
beta function over 70\% of zeros lie outside the inner islands, and thus would
be guaranteed to lie on the critical line by the arguments presented here. A
new sufficient condition for the Riemann Hypothesis to hold is also presented.

computational logics, where meanings of sentences are represented by pieces of
quantum information (generally, density operators of some Hilbert spaces),
which can be stored and transmitted by means of quantum particles. This
approach can be applied to a semantic characterization of epistemic logical
operations, which may occur in sentences like ""At time t0 Bob knows that at
time t Alice knows that the spin-value is up"". Each epistemic agent (say,
Alice, Bob,...) has a characteristic truth-perspective, corresponding to a
particular orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space C^2. From a physical point of
view, a truth-perspective can be associated to an apparatus that allows one to
measure a given observable. An important feature that characterizes the
knowledge of any agent is the amount of information that is accessible to
him/her (technically, a special set of density operators, which also represents
the internal memory of the agent in question). One can prove that interesting
epistemic operations are special examples of quantum channels, which generally
are not unitary. The act of knowing may involve some intrinsic irreversibility
due to possible measurement procedures or to a loss of information about the
environment. We also illustrate some relativistic-like effects that arise in
the behavior of epistemic agents.

circuit-theory in quantum computation. In these logics formulas are supposed to
denote pieces of quantum information (qubits, quregisters or mixtures of
quregisters), while logical connectives correspond to (quantum logical) gates
that transform quantum information in a reversible way. The characteristic
holistic features of the quantum theoretic formalism (which play an essential
role in entanglement-phenomena) can be used in order to develop a holistic
version of the quantum computational semantics. In contrast with the
compositional character of most standard semantic approaches, meanings of
formulas are here dealt with as global abstract objects that determine the
contextual meanings of the formulas' components (from the whole to the parts).
We present a survey of the most significant logical arguments that are valid or
that are possibly violated in the framework of this semantics. Some logical
features that may appear prima facie strange seem to reflect pretty well
informal arguments that are currently used in our rational activity.

they are somehow more fundamental than probabilities. Square roots of
probabilities appear in expressions of the Fisher-Rao Metric and the
Hellinger-Bhattacharyya distance. They also come into play in Quantum Mechanics
via the Born rule where probabilities are found by taking the squared modulus
of the quantum amplitude. Why should this be the case and why do these square
roots not arise in the various formulations of probability theory?
  In this short, inconclusive exploration, I consider quantifying a logical
statement with a vector defined by a set of components each quantifying one of
the atomic statements defining the hypothesis space. I show that conditional
probabilities (bi-valuations), such as $P(x|y)$, can be written as the dot
product of the two vectors quantifying the logical statements $x$ and $y$ each
normalized with respect to the vector quantifying the conditional $y$. The
components of the vectors are proportional to the square root of the
probability. As a result, this formulation is shown to be consistent with a
concept of orthogonality applied to the set of mutually exclusive atomic
statements such that the sum rule is represented as the sum of the squares of
the square roots of probability.

carried out by implementing the system over different modulation schemes,
different frame sizes, and different code rates in order to achieve a fair
comparison between irregular turbo code and regular Turbo Code. The simulation
results showed that the Irregular Turbo Code with 64QAM modulation is capable
of achieving a coding gain of 1.29 dB over its corresponding Turbo Code for a
