remnants, we present results of 2D3V particle-in-cell simulations of a
non-relativistic plasma shock with a large-scale perpendicular magnetic field
inclined at 45-deg angle to the simulation plane to approximate 3D physics. We
developed an improved clean setup that uses the collision of two plasma slabs
with different density and velocity, leading to the development of two
distinctive shocks and a contact discontinuity. The shock formation is mediated
by Weibel-type filamentation instabilities that generate magnetic turbulence.
Cyclic reformation is observed in both shocks with similar period, for which we
note global variations on account of shock rippling and local variations
arising from turbulent current filaments. The shock rippling occurs on spatial
and temporal scales given by gyro-motions of shock-reflected ions. The drift
motion of electrons and ions is not a gradient drift, but commensurates with E
x B drift. We observe a stable suprathermal tail in the ion spectra, but no
electron acceleration because the amplitude of Buneman modes in the shock foot
is insufficient for trapping relativistic electrons. We see no evidence of
turbulent reconnection. A comparison with other 2D simulation results suggests
that the plasma beta and the ion-to-electron mass ratio are not decisive for
efficient electron acceleration, but pre-acceleration efficacy might be reduced
with respect to the 2D results once three-dimensional effects are fully
accounted for. Other microphysical factors may also be at play to limit the
amplitude of Buneman waves or prevent return of electrons to the foot region.

  Processing (STAP)",,,,,"stat.AP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimating the disturbance or clutter covariance is a centrally important
problem in radar space time adaptive processing (STAP). The disturbance
covariance matrix should be inferred from training sample observations in
practice. Large number of homogeneous training samples are generally not
available because of difficulty of guaranteeing target free disturbance
observation, practical limitations imposed by the spatio-temporal
nonstationarity, and system considerations. In this dissertation, we look to
address the aforementioned challenges by exploiting physically inspired
constraints into ML estimation. While adding constraints is beneficial to
achieve satisfactory performance in the practical regime of limited training,
it leads to a challenging problem. We focus on breaking this classical
trade-off between computational tractability and desirable performance
measures, particularly in training starved regimes. In particular, we exploit
both the structure of the disturbance covariance and importantly the knowledge
of the clutter rank to yield a new rank constrained maximum likelihood (RCML)
estimator. In addition, we derive a new covariance estimator for STAP that
jointly considers a Toeplitz structure and a rank constraint on the clutter
component.
  Finally, we address the problem of working with inexact physical radar
parameters under a practical radar environment. We propose a robust covariance
estimation method via an expected likelihood (EL) approach. We analyze
covariance estimation algorithms under three different cases of imperfect
constraints: 1) only rank constraint, 2) both rank and noise power constraint,
and 3) condition number constraint. For each case, we formulate estimation of
the constraint as an optimization problem with the EL criterion and formally
derive and prove a significant analytical result such as uniqueness of the
solution.

is that the performance with ten increments closely approaches the performance

additive-white Gaussian noise (BI-AWGN) channels but also demonstrates that the
normal approximation works well on examples of fading channels as well as
high-SNR AWGN channels that require larger QAM constellations. The paper
explores both variable-length feedback codes with termination (VLFT) and the
more practical variable length feedback (VLF) codes without termination that

appropriately describe the spin susceptibility, $\chi_s$, and the intervalley
electron-phonon coupling in Li$_x$ZrNCl. At low doping, Li$_x$ZrNCl behaves as
a two-dimensional two-valley electron gas, with parabolic bands. In such a
system, $\chi_s$ increases with decreasing doping because of the
electron-electron interaction. We show that DFT with local functionals
(LDA/GGA) is not capable of reproducing this behavior. The use of exact
exchange in Hartree-Fock (HF) or in DFT hybrid functionals enhances $\chi_s$.
HF, B3LYP, and PBE0 approaches overestimate $\chi_s$, whereas the
range-separated HSE06 functional leads to results similar to those obtained in
the random phase approximation (RPA) applied to a two-valley two-spin electron
gas. Within HF, Li$_x$ZrNCl is even unstable towards a ferromagnetic state for
$x<0.16$. The intervalley phonons induce an imbalance in the valley occupation
that can be viewed as the effect of a pseudomagnetic field. Thus, similarly to
what happens for $\chi_s$, the electron-phonon coupling of intervalley phonons
is enhanced by the electron-electron interaction. Only hybrid DFT functionals
capture such an enhancement and the HSE06 functional reproduces the RPA results
presented in M. Calandra {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 114}, 077001
(2015)]. These results imply that the description of the susceptibility and
electron-phonon coupling with a range-separated hybrid functional would be
important also in other two-dimensional weakly doped semiconductors, such as
transition-metal dichalcogenides and graphene.

difficulties arising from sewing together classical and quantum mechanics:
deterministic operators, weak measurements and post-selection. Weak
Measurement, based on a very weak von Neumann coupling, is a unique kind of
quantum measurement with numerous theoretical and practical applications. In
contrast to other measurement techniques, it allows to gather a small amount of
information regarding the quantum system, with only a negligible probability of
collapsing it. A single weak measurement yields an almost random outcome, but
when performed repeatedly over a large ensemble, the averaged outcome becomes
increasingly robust and accurate. Importantly, a long sequence of weak
measurements can be thought of as a single projective measurement. I claim in
this work that classical variables appearing in the macro-world, such as centre
of mass, moment of inertia, pressure and average forces, result from a
multitude of quantum weak measurements performed in the micro-world. Here
again, the quantum outcomes are highly uncertain, but the law of large numbers
obliges their convergence to the definite quantities we know from our everyday
lives. By augmenting this description with a final boundary condition and
employing the notion of ""classical robustness under time-reversal"" I will draw
a quantitative borderline between the classical and quantum regimes. I will
conclude by analyzing the role of macroscopic systems in amplifying and
recording quantum outcomes.

show evidence for an unexpectedly similar suppression of both light and heavy
flavor jets. Furthermore, the role of radiative energy loss of heavy quarks is
still under active discussion within the theoretical community. By employing
the parton cascade Boltzmann Approach to Multi-Parton Scatterings (BAMPS),
which numerically solves the 3+1D Boltzmann equation both for light and heavy
flavor partons, we calculate the nuclear modification factor of inclusive and
b-tagged reconstructed jets in 0-10% central $\sqrt{s_{\rm LHC}}$ = 2.76 ATeV
Pb+Pb collisions. Based on perturbative QCD cross sections we find a
suppression of both light and heavy flavor jets. While the inclusive jets are
slightly too strong suppressed within BAMPS in comparison with data, both
elastic+radiative and only elastic interactions lead to a realistic b-tagged
jet suppression. To further investigate light and heavy flavor energy loss we
predict the R dependence of inclusive and b-tagged jet suppression.
Furthermore, we propose the medium modification of b-tagged jet shapes as an
observable for discriminating between different heavy quark energy loss
scenarios.

a quantum bus, and high-fidelity readout are important tasks for quantum
technology. Realizing these tasks is challenging in the presence of realistic
couplings to an environment. Here, we introduce and assess protocols that can
be used in cavity QED to perform high-fidelity quantum state transfer and fast
quantum nondemolition qubit readout through Hamiltonian engineering. We show
that high-fidelity state transfer between a cavity and a single qubit can be
performed, even in the limit of strong dephasing due to inhomogeneous
broadening. We generalize this result to state transfer between a cavity and a
logical qubit encoded in a collective mode of a large ensemble of $N$ physical
qubits. Under a decoupling sequence, we show that inhomogeneity in the ensemble
couples two collective bright states to only two other collective modes,
leaving the remaining $N-3$ single-excitation states dark. Moreover, we show
that large signal-to-noise and high single-shot fidelity can be achieved in a
cavity-based qubit readout, even in the weak-coupling limit. These ideas may be
important for novel systems coupling single spins to a microwave cavity.

the measured upper limit on the abundance of 59Ni in the cosmic ray flux with
the 59Ni abundance predictions of the up-to-date stellar evolution models.
Non-detection of 59Ni in the cosmic ray flux has previously been attributed to
a large time delay of the order of 1e5 yr between the moment of supernova
explosion and the onset of particle acceleration process. This large time delay
was considered as an argument in favour of the ""superbubble"" scenario. We show
that the recent calculation of the 59Ni yield of massive stars, which takes
into account the initial mass range up to 120 solar masses and includes stellar
rotation, results in prediction of low 59Ni abundance relative to its decay
product 59Co. The predicted abundance is consistent with the upper bound on
59Ni abundance in the cosmic ray flux for the supernova parameters assumed.
This result removes the necessity of decay of 59Ni in the time interval between
the supernova explosion and the onset of acceleration process and restores the
consistency of measurements of 59Ni / 59Co abundances with the ""supernova""

act as an access point for other users. To incentivize user participation in
this network, we allow the users to trade their data plan and obtain some
profits by selling and buying leftover data capacities (caps) from each other.
We formulate the buyers and sellers association for data trading as a matching
game. In this game, buyers and sellers rank one another based on preference
functions that capture buyers' data demand and QoS requirements, sellers'
available data and energy resources. We show that these preferences are
interdependent and influenced by the existing network-wide matching. For this
reason, the game can be classified as a one-to-many matching game with
externalities. To solve this game, a distributed algorithm that combines
notions from matching theory and market equilibrium is proposed. The algorithm
enables the players to self-organize into a stable matching and dynamic
adaptation of price to data demand and supply. The properties of the resulting
matching are discussed. Moreover, the price benchmark for the users to join the
UPN and the operator gain are also determined. Simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm yields an improvement of the average utility per user up to
25% and 50% relative to random matching and worst case utility, respectively.

show that colored-in-time excitation of the Navier-Stokes equations can also be

understood. The proximity of Betelgeuse makes it an appealing target to study
its atmosphere, map the shape of its envelope, and follow the structure of its
wind from the photosphere out to the interstellar medium. Aims. A link is
suspected between the powerful convective motions in Betelgeuse and its mass
loss. We aim to constrain the spatial structure and temporal evolution of the
convective pattern on the photosphere and to search for evidence of this link.
Methods. We report new interferometric observations in the infrared H band
using the VLTI/PIONIER instrument. We monitored the photosphere of Betelgeuse
between 2012 January and 2014 November to look for evolutions that may trigger
the outflow. Results. Our interferometric observations at low spatial
frequencies are compatible with the presence of a hot spot on the photosphere
that has a characteristic width of one stellar radius. It appears to be
superposed on the smaller scale convective pattern. In the higher spatial
frequency domain, we observe a significant difference between the observations
and the predictions of 3D hydrodynamical simulations. Conclusions. We bring new
evidence for the presence of a convective pattern in the photosphere of red
supergiants. The inferred hot spot is probably the top of a giant convection
cell although an asymmetric extension of the star cannot be excluded by these
interferometric observations alone. The properties of the observed surface
features show a stronger contrast and inhomogeneity as predicted by 3D
radiative hydrodynamical simulations. We propose that the large observed
feature is modifying the signature of the convective pattern at the surface of
the star in a way that simulations cannot reproduce.

the famous almost Mathieu operator, allowing for a wider range of lattice
geometries (parametrized by three coupling parameters) by permitting 2D
electrons to hop to both nearest and next nearest neighboring (NNN) lattice
sites, while still exhibiting its characteristic symmetry (Aubry duality).
Previous understanding of the spectral theory of this model was restricted to
two dual regions of the parameter space, one of which is characterized by the
positivity of the Lyapunov exponent. In this paper, we complete the picture
with a description of the spectral measures over the entire remaining
(self-dual) region, for all irrational values of the frequency parameter (the
magnetic flux in the model). Most notably, we prove that in the entire interior
of this regime, the model exhibits a collapse from purely ac spectrum to purely
sc spectrum when the NNN interaction becomes symmetric. In physics literature,
extensive numerical analysis had indicated such ""spectral collapse,"" however so
far not even a heuristic argument for this phenomenon could be provided. On the
other hand, in the remaining part of the self-dual region, the spectral
measures are singular continuous irrespective of such symmetry. The analysis
requires some rather delicate number theoretic estimates, which ultimately
depend on the solution of a problem posed by Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres.

parameter estimation in sloppy models. We show that the approximate nature of
mathematical models poses challenges for experimental design in sloppy models.
In many models of complex biological processes it is unknown what are the
relevant physics that must be included to explain collective behaviors. As a
consequence, models are often overly complex, with many practically
unidentifiable parameters. Furthermore, which details are relevant/irrelevant
vary among potential experiments. By selecting complementary experiments,
experimental design may inadvertently make details that were ommitted from the
model become relevant. When this occurs, the model will fail to give a good fit
to the data. We use a simple hyper-model of model error to quantify a model's
inadequacy and apply it to two models of complex biological processes (EGFR
signaling and DNA repair) with optimally selected experiments. We find that
although parameters may be accurately estimated, the error in the model renders
it less predictive than it was in the sloppy regime where model error is small.
We introduce the concept of a \emph{sloppy system}--a sequence of models of
increasing complexity that become sloppy in the limit of microscopic accuracy.
We explore the limits of accurate parameter estimation in sloppy systems and
argue that system identification better approached by considering a hierarchy
of models of varying detail rather than focusing parameter estimation in a
single model.

smallest among all exploration algorithms not knowing the location of faults.
We design a perfectly competitive exploration algorithm for any ring, and show
that, for networks modeled by hamiltonian graphs, the overhead of any DFS

no preferred JSJ decomposition, and the right object to consider is the whole
set of JSJ decompositions, which forms a contractible space: the JSJ
deformation space (analogous to Outer Space).
  We prove that JSJ decompositions exist for any finitely presented group,

describe flexible vertices of JSJ decompositions as quadratically hanging

relatively hyperbolic groups over virtually cyclic or parabolic subgroups.
Using trees of cylinders, we obtain canonical JSJ trees (which are invariant
under automorphisms).
  We introduce a variant in which the property of being universally elliptic is
replaced by the more restrictive and rigid property of being universally
compatible. This yields a canonical compatibility JSJ tree, not just a
deformation space. We show that it exists for any finitely presented group.

associated with the merger of two compact objects, either two neutron stars, or
a neutron star and a black hole. The presence of at least one neutron star has
long been thought to be an essential element of the model: its tidal disruption
provides the needed baryonic material whose rapid accretion onto the
post-merger black hole powers the burst. The recent tentative detection by the
Fermi satellite of a short GRB in association with the gravitational wave
signal GW150914 produced by the merger of two black holes has challenged this
standard paradigm. Here we show that the evolution of two high-mass,
low-metallicity stars with main sequence rotational speeds a few tens of
percent of the critical speed eventually undergoing a weak supernova explosion
{\em can} produce a short gamma-ray burst. The outer layers of the envelope of
the last exploding star remain bound and circularize at large radii. With time,
the disk cools and becomes neutral, suppressing the magneto-rotational
instability, and hence the viscosity. The disk remains 'long-lived dead' until
tidal torques and shocks during the pre-merger phase heat it up and re-ignite
accretion, rapidly consuming the disk and powering the short gamma-ray burst.

perturbation analysis (IPA) to construct a stochastic gradient estimator and
show that this estimator is unbiased. We also show that the stochastic gradient
ascent algorithm using the constructed gradient estimator converges to a
stationary point of the q-EI surface, and therefore, as the number of multiple

grow large, the one-step Bayes optimal set of points is recovered. We show in
numerical experiments that our method for maximizing the q-EI is faster than
methods based on closed-form evaluation using high-dimensional integration,
when considering many parallel function evaluations, and is comparable in speed
when considering few. We also show that the resulting one-step Bayes optimal
algorithm for parallel global optimization finds high-quality solutions with
fewer evaluations than a heuristic based on approximately maximizing the q-EI.

  satisfiability problems",,,,,"cs.CC cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transient chaos is an ubiquitous phenomenon characterizing the dynamics of
phase space trajectories evolving towards a steady state attractor in physical
systems as diverse as fluids, chemical reactions and condensed matter systems.
Here we show that transient chaos also appears in the dynamics of certain
efficient algorithms searching for solutions of constraint satisfaction
problems that include scheduling, circuit design, routing, database problems or
even Sudoku. In particular, we present a study of the emergence of hardness in
Boolean satisfiability ($k$-SAT), a canonical class of constraint satisfaction
problems, by using an analog deterministic algorithm based on a system of
ordinary differential equations. Problem hardness is defined through the escape
rate $\kappa$, an invariant measure of transient chaos of the dynamical system
corresponding to the analog algorithm, and it expresses the rate at which the
trajectory approaches a solution.We show that for a given density of
constraints and fixed number of Boolean variables $N$, the hardness of formulas
in random $k$-SAT ensembles has a wide variation, approximable by a lognormal
distribution. We also show that when increasing the density of constraints
$\alpha$, hardness appears through a second-order phase transition at
$\alpha_{\chi}$ in the random 3-SAT ensemble where dynamical trajectories
become transiently chaotic. A similar behavior is found in 4-SAT as well,
however, such transition does not occur for 2-SAT. This behavior also implies a
novel type of transient chaos in which the escape rate has an
exponential-algebraic dependence on the critical parameter $\kappa \sim
N^{B|\alpha - \alpha_{\chi}|^{1-\gamma}}$ with $0< \gamma < 1$. We demonstrate
that the transition is generated by the appearance of metastable basins in the
solution space as the density of constraints $\alpha$ is increased.

shrinks the coefficient estimates of irrelevant covariates towards zero, thus
useful for nonlinear regressions. Also, this MDP/OLS functional methodology can
be extended to methods for analyzing the sensitivity of the

extended to a Vibration of Effects analysis. The methodology is illustrated
through the analysis of simulated and real data sets. Overall, this study

bands covering a wide range of X-ray photon energy. In all pairs of bands
compared, the harder band consistently lags the softer band by at least 1000s,
at temporal frequencies ~5E-5 Hz. In addition, soft-band lags up to 400s are
measured at frequencies ~2E-4 Hz. Light echos from an excess of soft band
emission in the inner accretion disk cannot explain the lags in these data, as
they are seen in cross-correlations with energy bands where the softer band is
expected to have no contribution from reflection. The basic properties of the
time delays have been parameterised by fitting a top hat response function that
varies with photon energy, taking fully into account the covariance between
measured time lag values. The low-frequency hard-band lags and the transition
to soft-band lags are consistent with time lags arising as reverberation delays
from circumnuclear scattering of X-rays, although greater model complexity is
required to explain the entire spectrum of lags. The scattered fraction
increases with increasing photon energy as expected, and the scattered fraction
is high, indicating the reprocessor to have a global covering fraction ~50%

active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to obtain information about the excitation
mechanisms that power it and the location where it is formed. We employ a NIR
FeII template derived in the literature and found that it successfully
reproduces the observed FeII spectrum. The FeII bump at 9200 Angstroms detected
in all objects studied confirms that Lyman-alpha fluorescence is always present
in AGNs. The The correlation found between the flux of the 9200 Angstroms bump,
the 1 micron lines and the optical FeII imply that Lyman-alpha fluorescence
plays an important role in the FeII production. We determined that at least 18%
of the optical FeII is due to this process while collisional excitation
dominates the production of the observed FeII. The line profiles of FeII 10502,
OI 11287, CaII 8664 and Paschen-beta were compared to gather information about
the most likely location where they are emitted. We found that FeII, OI and
CaII have similar widths and are, on average, 30% narrower than Paschen-beta.
Assuming that the clouds emitting the lines are virialized, we show that the
FeII is emitted in a region twice as far from the central source than
Paschen-beta. The distance though strongly varies: from 8.5 light-days for
NGC4051 to 198.2 light-days for Mrk509. Our results reinforce the importance of
the FeII in the NIR to constrain critical parameters that drive its physics and
the underlying AGN kinematics as well as more accurate models aimed at

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CC cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We prove that any algorithm for learning parities requires either a memory of
quadratic size or an exponential number of samples. This proves a recent
conjecture of Steinhardt, Valiant and Wager and shows that for some learning
problems a large storage space is crucial.
  More formally, in the problem of parity learning, an unknown string $x \in
\{0,1\}^n$ was chosen uniformly at random. A learner tries to learn $x$ from a
stream of samples $(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2) \ldots$, where each~$a_t$ is
uniformly distributed over $\{0,1\}^n$ and $b_t$ is the inner product of $a_t$
and $x$, modulo~2. We show that any algorithm for parity learning, that uses
less than $\frac{n^2}{25}$ bits of memory, requires an exponential number of
samples.
  Previously, there was no non-trivial lower bound on the number of samples
needed, for any learning problem, even if the allowed memory size is $O(n)$
(where $n$ is the space needed to store one sample).
  We also give an application of our result in the field of bounded-storage
cryptography. We show an encryption scheme that requires a private key of
length $n$, as well as time complexity of $n$ per encryption/decription of each
bit, and is provenly and unconditionally secure as long as the attacker uses
less than $\frac{n^2}{25}$ memory bits and the scheme is used at most an
exponential number of times. Previous works on bounded-storage cryptography
assumed that the memory size used by the attacker is at most linear in the time
needed for encryption/decription.

back off from modeling and merely seek good prediction. Even in M-complete
problems, taking a predictive approach can be very useful. Stacking is a model
averaging procedure that gives a composite predictor by combining individual
predictors from a list of models using weights that optimize a cross-validation
criterion. We show that the stacking weights also asymptotically minimize a
posterior expected loss. Hence we formally provide a Bayesian justification for
cross-validation. Often the weights are constrained to be positive and sum to
one. For greater generality, we omit the positivity constraint and relax the
`sum to one' constraint.
  A key question is `What predictors should be in the average?' We first verify
that the stacking error depends only on the span of the models. Then we propose
using bootstrap samples from the data to generate empirical basis elements that
can be used to form models. We use this in two computed examples to give
stacking predictors that are (i) data driven, (ii) optimal with respect to the
number of component predictors, and (iii) optimal with respect to the weight
each predictor gets.

existing internal rhythms and to establish metabolic cycles that schedule
biochemical processes in time. A periodically changing allocation of the
protein budget between reactions or pathways may increase the overall metabolic
efficiency. To study this hypothesis, I quantify the possible benefits of
small-amplitude enzyme rhythms in kinetic models. Starting from an
enzyme-optimised steady state, I score the effects of possible enzyme rhythms
on a metabolic objective and optimise their amplitudes and phase shifts.
Assuming small-amplitude rhythms around an optimal reference state, optimal
phases and amplitudes can be computed by solving a quadratic optimality
problem. In models without amplitude constraints, general periodic enzyme
profiles can be obtained by Fourier synthesis. The theory of optimal enzyme
rhythms combines the dynamics and economics of metabolic systems and explains
how optimal small-amplitude enzyme profiles are shaped by network structure,
kinetics, external rhythms, and the metabolic objective. The formulae show how
orchestrated enzyme rhythms can exploit synergy effects to improve metabolic
performance and that optimal enzyme profiles are not simply adapted to existing
metabolic rhythms, but that they actively shape these rhythms to improve their
own (and other enzymes') efficiency. The resulting optimal enzyme profiles
""portray"" the enzymes' dynamic effects in the network: for example, enzymes
that act synergistically may be coexpressed, periodically and with some optimal
phase shifts. The theory yields optimality conditions for enzyme rhythms in
metabolic cycles, with static enzyme adaptation as a special case, and predicts
how cells should combine transcriptional and posttranslational regulation to
realise enzyme rhythms at different frequencies.

number of substitutions during molecular evolution of a sequence can be
estimated for a given substitution model, no simple solution exists for the
variance of this random variable. We show in this article that the computation
of the variance is as simple as that of the mean number of substitutions for
both short and long times. Apart from its fundamental importance, this result
can be used to investigate the dispersion index R , i.e. the ratio of the
variance to the mean substitution number, which is of prime importance in the
neutral theory of molecular evolution. By investigating large classes of
substitution models, we demonstrate that although R\ge1 , to obtain R
significantly larger than unity necessitates in general additional hypotheses
on the structure of the substitution model.

M-dwarf stars are expected to be in synchronous rotation, as a consequence of
strong tidal interactions with their host stars. Previous global climate model
(GCM) studies have shown that, for slowly-rotating planets, strong convection
at the substellar point can create optically thick water clouds, increasing the
planetary albedo, and thus stabilizing the climate against a thermal runaway.
However these studies did not use self-consistent orbital/rotational periods
for synchronously rotating planets placed at different distances from the host
star. Here we provide new estimates of the inner edge of the habitable zone for
synchronously rotating terrestrial planets around late-K and M-dwarf stars
using a 3-D Earth-analog GCM with self-consistent relationships between stellar
metallicity, stellar effective temperature, and the planetary
orbital/rotational period. We find that both atmospheric dynamics and the
efficacy of the substellar cloud deck are sensitive to the precise rotation
rate of the planet. Around mid-to-late M-dwarf stars with low metallicity,
planetary rotation rates at the inner edge of the HZ become faster, and the
inner edge of the habitable zone is farther away from the host stars than in
previous GCM studies. For an Earth-sized planet, the dynamical regime of the
substellar clouds begins to transition as the rotation rate approaches ~10
days. These faster rotation rates produce stronger zonal winds that encircle
the planet and smear the substellar clouds around it, lowering the planetary
albedo, and causing the onset of the water-vapor greenhouse climatic
instability to occur at up to ~25% lower incident stellar fluxes than found in
previous GCM studies. For mid-to-late M-dwarf stars with high metallicity and
for mid-K to early-M stars, we agree with previous studies.

models. It involves only one kind of neural computation, performed in both the
first phase (when the prediction is made) and the second phase of training
(after the target or prediction error is revealed). Although this algorithm
computes the gradient of an objective function just like Backpropagation, it
does not need a special computation or circuit for the second phase, where
errors are implicitly propagated. Equilibrium Propagation shares similarities
with Contrastive Hebbian Learning and Contrastive Divergence while solving the
theoretical issues of both algorithms: our algorithm computes the gradient of a
well defined objective function. Because the objective function is defined in
terms of local perturbations, the second phase of Equilibrium Propagation
corresponds to only nudging the prediction (fixed point, or stationary
distribution) towards a configuration that reduces prediction error. In the
case of a recurrent multi-layer supervised network, the output units are
slightly nudged towards their target in the second phase, and the perturbation
introduced at the output layer propagates backward in the hidden layers. We
show that the signal 'back-propagated' during this second phase corresponds to
the propagation of error derivatives and encodes the gradient of the objective
function, when the synaptic update corresponds to a standard form of
spike-timing dependent plasticity. This work makes it more plausible that a
mechanism similar to Backpropagation could be implemented by brains, since
leaky integrator neural computation performs both inference and error
back-propagation in our model. The only local difference between the two phases
is whether synaptic changes are allowed or not.

measurements to control of individual quantum systems; however, dissipation can
also be a useful resource. Remarkably, engineered dissipation enables the
preparation of quantum states of atoms, ions or superconducting qubits as well
as their stabilization. This is achieved by a suitably engineered coupling to a
dissipative cold reservoir formed by electromagnetic modes. Similarly, in the
field of cavity electro- and optomechanics, the control over mechanical
oscillators utilizes the inherently cold, dissipative nature of the
electromagnetic degree of freedom. Breaking from this paradigm, recent
theoretical work has considered the opposite regime in which the dissipation of
the mechanical oscillator dominates and provides a cold, dissipative reservoir
to an electromagnetic mode. Here we realize this reversed dissipation regime in
a microwave cavity optomechanical system and realize a quasi-instantaneous,
cold reservoir for microwave light. Coupling to this reservoir enables to
manipulate the susceptibility of the microwave cavity, corresponding to
dynamical backaction control of the microwave field. Additionally, we observe
the onset of parametric instability, i.e. the stimulated emission of microwaves
(masing). Equally important, the reservoir can function as a useful quantum
resource. We evidence this by employing the engineered cold reservoir to
implement a large gain (above 40 dB) phase preserving microwave amplifier that
operates 0.87 quanta above the limit of added noise imposed by quantum
mechanics. Such a dissipative cold reservoir forms the basis of microwave
entanglement schemes, the study of dissipative quantum phase transitions,
amplifiers with unlimited gain-bandwidth product and non-reciprocal devices,
thereby extending the available toolbox of quantum-limited microwave
manipulation techniques.

photometry and K-band spectroscopy the massive stars are placed in a
Hertzsprung Russell diagram. By comparison with evolutionary models, their age
and hence the star formation history of W49 can be investigated. Fourteen O
type stars as well as two young stellar objects (YSOs) are identified by our
spectroscopic survey. Eleven O-stars are main sequence stars with subtypes
ranging from O3 to O9.5, with masses ranging from $\sim 20$ $M_{\odot}$ to
$\sim 120$ $M_{\odot}$. Three of the O-stars show strong wind features, and are
considered to be Of-type supergiants with masses beyond 100 $M_{\odot}$ . The
two YSOs show CO emission, indicative for the presence of circumstellar disks
in the central region of the massive cluster. The age of the cluster is
estimated as $\sim1.5$ Myr, with star formation still ongoing in different

relatively high rotational frequencies. Here we report the detection of an

Andromeda galaxy, the slowest pulsar ever found in a globular cluster. This

since the onset of high-precision photometry from space-based observations. An
exciting new theoretical result shows that the previously observed suppression
of dipole oscillation modes in red giants can be used to detect strong magnetic
fields in the stellar cores. A fundamental facet of the theory is that nearly
all the mode energy leaking into the core is trapped by the magnetic greenhouse
effect. This results in clear predictions for how the mode visibility changes
as a star evolves up the red giant branch, and how that depends on stellar
mass, spherical degree, and mode lifetime. Here, we investigate the validity of
these predictions with a focus on the visibility of different spherical
degrees. We find that mode suppression weakens for higher degree modes with an
average reduction in the quadrupole mode visibility of up to 49% for the least
evolved stars in our sample, and no detectable suppression of octupole modes,
in agreement with the theoretical predictions. We furthermore find evidence for
the influence of increasing mode lifetimes on the measured visibilities along
the red giant branch, in agreement with previous independent observations.
These results support the theory that strong internal magnetic fields are
responsible for the observed suppression of non-radial modes in red giants. We
also find preliminary evidence that stars with suppressed dipole modes on

which provides a framework to measure deviations from the concordance
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology, allowing for deviations in both geometric and/or

in our recent study of the first two HFF fields, we confine our primary search
for high-redshift candidates in the HFF imaging to the uniformly deep (i.e.
sigma_160>30 AB mag in 0.5-arcsec diameter apertures), relatively low
magnification regions. In the CLASH fields our search was confined to uniformly
deep regions where sigma_160>28.8 AB mag. Our SED fitting analysis unveils a
sample of 33 galaxy candidates at z_phot>=8.4, five of which have primary
photometric redshift solutions in the range 9.6<z_phot<11.2. By calculating a
de-lensed effective volume for each candidate, the improved statistics and
reduced cosmic variance provided by our new sample allows a more accurate
determination of the UV-selected galaxy luminosity function (LF) at z~9. Our
new results strengthen our previous conclusion that the LF appears to evolve
smoothly from z=8 to z=9, an evolution which can be equally well modelled by a
factor of ~2 drop in density, or a dimming of ~0.5 mag in M*. Moreover, based
on our new sample, we are able to place initial constraints on the z=10 LF,
finding that the number density at M_1500 ~ -19.7 is log(phi) = -4.1
(+0.2,-0.3), a factor of ~2 lower than at z=9. Finally, we use our new results
to re-visit the issue of the decline in UV luminosity density at z>=8. We
conclude that the data continue to support a smooth decline in rho_UV over the

gating with strong coupling far beyond the RWA regime. We perform numerical

realize the key Hadamard and $\frac{\pi}{8}$ gates with coupling strengths up
to several times the qubit splitting. Working in this manifestly non-RWA

more massive B-type progenitor. In this paper we study an optical/IR transient
discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC4490, which appeared similar to these merger
events (unobscured progenitor, irregular multi-peaked light curve, increasingly
red color, similar optical spectrum, IR excess at late times), but which had a
higher peak luminosity and longer duration in outburst. NGC4490-OT has less in
common with the class of SN~2008S-like transients. A progenitor detected in
pre-eruption HST images, combined with upper limits in the IR, requires a
luminous and blue progenitor that has faded in late-time HST images. The same
source was detected by Spitzer and ground-based data as a luminous IR
transient, indicating a transition to a self-obscured state qualitatively
similar to the evolution seen in other stellar mergers and in LBVs. The
post-outburst dust-obscured source is too luminous and too warm at late times
to be explained with an IR echo, suggesting that the object survived the event.
The luminosity of the enshrouded IR source is similar to that of the
progenitor. Compared to proposed merger events, the more massive progenitor of
NGC4490-OT seems to extend a correlation between stellar mass and peak
luminosity, and may suggest that both of these correlate with duration. We show
that spectra of NGC4490-OT and V838 Mon also resemble light-echo spectra of eta
Car, prompting us to speculate that eta Car may be an extreme extension of this

in their centers. Their interaction with the surrounding gas results in
accretion and exchange of angular momentum via tidal torques, facilitating
binary inspiral. Here we explore the non-trivial coupling between these two
processes and analyze how the global properties of externally supplied
circumbinary disks depend on the binary accretion rate. By formulating our
results in terms of the angular momentum flux driven by internal stresses, we
come up with a very simple classification of the possible global disk
structures, which differ from the standard constant $\dot M$ accretion disk
solution. Suppression of accretion by the binary tides, leading to a
significant mass accumulation in the inner disk, accelerates binary inspiral.
We show that once the disk region strongly perturbed by the viscously
transmitted tidal torque exceeds the binary semi-major axis, the binary can
merge in less than its mass-doubling time due to accretion. Thus, unlike the
inspirals driven by stellar scattering, the gas-assisted merger can occur even
if the binary is embedded in a relatively low mass disk (lower than its own
mass). This is important for resolving the ""last parsec"" problem for SMBH
binaries and understanding powerful gravitational wave sources in the Universe.
We argue that the enhancement of accretion by the binary found in some recent
simulations cannot persist for a long time and should not affect the long-term
orbital inspiral. We also review the existing simulations of the SMBH
binary-disk coupling and propose a numerical setup, which is particularly well
suited for verifying our theoretical predictions.

envelope of an audio signal. Conserving energy in video has the potential to
preserve textures rather than low-passing them. Explicitly quantizing a gain
allows a simple contrast masking model with no signaling cost. Vector
quantizing the shape keeps the number of degrees of freedom the same as scalar
quantization, avoiding redundancy in the representation. We demonstrate how to
predict the vector by transforming the space it is encoded in, rather than
subtracting off the predictor, which would make energy conservation impossible.
We also derive an encoding of the vector-quantized codewords that takes
advantage of their non-uniform distribution. We show that the resulting
technique outperforms scalar quantization by an average of 0.90 dB on still

could be elucidated and verified, then this will lay the foundations for
exploiting such effects in nanoscale devices and thin-film materials.When the
core of a graphene-like polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) is weakly coupled to
external electrodes by atoms i and j, the single-molecule electrical
conductance sigma-ij depends on the choice of connecting atoms i,j.
Furthermore, conductance ratios sigma-ij/sigma-lm corresponding to different
connectivities i,j and l,m are determined by quantum interference within the
PAH core. In this paper, we examine how such conductance ratios change when one
of the carbon atoms within the ""parent"" PAH core is replaced by a heteroatom to
yield a ""daughter"" molecule. For bipartite parental cores, in which
odd-numbered sites are connected to even-numbered sites only, the effect of
heteroatom substitution onto an odd-numbered site is summarized by the
following qualitative rules:
  (a) When i and j are odd, both parent and daughter have low conductances (b)
When i is odd and j is even, or vice versa both parent and daughter have high
conductances (c) When i,j are both even, the parent has a low conductance and
the daughter a high conductance. These rules are verified by comparison with
density-functional calculations on naphthalene, anthracene, pyrene and
anthanthrene cores connected via two different anchor groups to gold

(matrix completion) to the recovery of low rank tensors of higher order from a
small number of linear measurements. While the theoretical understanding of low
rank matrix recovery is already well-developed, only few contributions on the
low rank tensor recovery problem are available so far. In this paper, we
introduce versions of the iterative hard thresholding algorithm for several
tensor decompositions, namely the higher order singular value decomposition
(HOSVD), the tensor train format (TT), and the general hierarchical Tucker
decomposition (HT). We provide a partial convergence result for these
algorithms which is based on a variant of the restricted isometry property of
the measurement operator adapted to the tensor decomposition at hand that
induces a corresponding notion of tensor rank. We show that subgaussian
measurement ensembles satisfy the tensor restricted isometry property with high
probability under a certain almost optimal bound on the number of measurements
which depends on the corresponding tensor format. These bounds are extended to
partial Fourier maps combined with random sign flips of the tensor entries.
Finally, we illustrate the performance of iterative hard thresholding methods
for tensor recovery via numerical experiments where we consider recovery from
Gaussian random measurements, tensor completion (recovery of missing entries),
and Fourier measurements for third order tensors.

framework allows the transparent set-up of different types of micro-macro

we focus on the case of an interface between a classical Cauchy continuum on
one side and a relaxed micromorphic one on the other side. As expected, we find
a complete reflection in the frequency intervals for which band-gaps are known
to occur in the relaxed micromorphic continuum and precise
microstructure-related reflective patterns are identified. We repeat a similar
study for analogous connections between a classical Cauchy continuum and a
Mindlin's micromorphic one and we show that the reflective properties of the

are not allowed in standard Mindlin's micromorphic media. The present work
opens the way towards the possibility of conceiving complex metastructures in
which band-gap metamaterials and classical materials are coupled together to
produce structures with completely new and unorthodox properties with respect
to wave propagation, transmission and reflection. Last, but not least, indirect

object decaying into photons. As an atom bound by a central potential it is a
parity eigenstate, and as an atom built out of an electron and an anti-electron
it is an eigenstate of the charge conjugation operator. Therefore, the
positronium is a unique laboratory to study discrete symmetries whose precision
is limited in principle by the effects due to the weak interactions expected at
the level of (~10$^{-14}$) and photon-photon interactions expected at the level
of (~10$^{-9}$). The J-PET detector enables to perform tests of discrete
symmetries in the leptonic sector via the determination of the expectation
values of the discrete-symmetries-odd operators, which may be constructed from
the spin of ortho-positronium atom and the momenta and polarization vectors of

effective bias (or, equivalently, the exchange-correlation bias) depends
strongly on the interaction strength and the length of the central (chain)

peaked BL Lac 1ES 1011+496 (z=0.212) in flaring state at very-high energy (VHE,
E>100GeV). The flux reached a level more than 10 times higher than any
previously recorded flaring state of the source. We present the description of
the characteristics of the flare presenting the light curve and the spectral
parameters of the night-wise spectra and the average spectrum of the whole
period. From these data we aim at detecting the imprint of the Extragalactic
Background Light (EBL) in the VHE spectrum of the source, in order to constrain
its intensity in the optical band. For this we implement the method developed
by the H.E.S.S. collaboration in which the intrinsic energy spectrum of the
source is modeled with a simple function, and the EBL-induced optical depth is
calculated using a template EBL model. The likelihood of the observed spectrum
is then maximized, including a normalization factor for the EBL opacity among
the free parameters. From the data collected differential energy spectra was
produced for all nights of the observed period. Evaluating the changes in the
fit parameters we conclude that the spectral shape for most of the nights were
compatible, regardless of the flux level, which enabled us to produce an
average spectrum from which the EBL imprint could be constrained. The
likelihood ratio test shows that the model with an EBL density
1.07(-0.20,+0.24)_{stat+sys}, relative to the one in the tested EBL template
(Dominguez et al.2011), is preferred at the 4.6 sigma level to the no-EBL
hypothesis, with the assumption that the intrinsic source spectrum can be
modeled as a log-parabola. This would translate into a constraint of the EBL

sciences, and it creates a need for robust social network algorithms, which can
simultaneously provide guarantees across a spectrum of models and parameter
settings. We begin an investigation into this broad domain by studying robust
algorithms for the Influence Maximization problem, in which the goal is to
identify a set of k nodes in a social network whose joint influence on the
network is maximized.
  We define a Robust Influence Maximization framework wherein an algorithm is
presented with a set of influence functions, typically derived from different
influence models or different parameter settings for the same model. The
different parameter settings could be derived from observed cascades on
different topics, under different conditions, or at different times. The
algorithm's goal is to identify a set of k nodes who are simultaneously
influential for all influence functions, compared to the (function-specific)
optimum solutions.
  We show strong approximation hardness results for this problem unless the
algorithm gets to select at least a logarithmic factor more seeds than the
optimum solution. However, when enough extra seeds may be selected, we show
that techniques of Krause et al. can be used to approximate the optimum robust
influence to within a factor of 1 - 1/e. We evaluate this bicriteria
approximation algorithm against natural heuristics on several real-world data
sets. Our experiments indicate that the worst-case hardness does not
necessarily translate into bad performance on real-world data sets; all
algorithms perform fairly well.

with an infinite number of blocks, over any positive time horizon, it
transitions into an almost surely finite number of blocks. This is known as
`coming down from infinity'. Moreover, of the many different (exchangeable)
stochastic coalescent models, Kingman's coalescent is the `fastest' to come
down from infinity. In this article we study what happens when we counteract
this `fastest' coalescent with the action of an extreme form of fragmentation.
We augment Kingman's coalescent, where any two blocks merge at rate $c>0$, with
a fragmentation mechanism where each block fragments at constant rate,
$\lambda>0$, into it's constituent elements. We prove that there exists a phase
transition at $\lambda=c/2$, between regimes where the resulting `fast'
fragmentation-coalescence process is able to come down from infinity or not. In
the case that $\lambda<c/2$ we develop an excursion theory for the fast
fragmentation-coalescence process out of which a number of interesting

applications. The presence of discontinuous deformations - such as shear
banding or wall slip - creates new mechanisms for mixing and transport beyond
those predicted by classical dynamical systems theory. Here we show how a novel
mixing mechanism combining stretching with cutting and shuffling yields
exponential mixing rates, quantified by a positive Lyapunov exponent, an
impossibility for systems with cutting and shuffling alone or bounded systems
with stretching alone, and demonstrate it in a fluid flow. While dynamical
systems theory provides a framework for understanding mixing in smoothly
deforming media, a theory of discontinuous mixing is yet to be fully developed.
New methods are needed to systematize, explain and extrapolate measurements on
systems with discontinuous deformations. Here we investigate 'webs' of
Lagrangian discontinuities and show that they provide a template for the
overall transport dynamics. Considering slip deformations as the asymptotic
limit of increasingly localised smooth shear we also demonstrate exactly how
some of the new structures introduced by discontinuous deformations are
analogous to structures in smoothly deforming systems.

and the other half does not approve each candidate approved on the ballot. This
restores positive support, and also makes the method equivalent to the D'Hondt
party-list method for party voting. PAMSAC reduces to simple approval voting in
the single-winner case. A score voting version is described that also reduces
to simple score voting in the single-winner case.

isolate the redshifted 21cm spectral line emission from the Dark Ages and the
Epoch of Reionization and unlock the scientific potential of 21cm cosmology.
Past work has focused on characterizing mean antenna beam models using either
satellite signals or astronomical sources as calibrators, but
antenna-to-antenna variation due to imperfect instrumentation has remained
unexplored. We characterize this variation for the Murchison Widefield Array
(MWA) through laboratory measurements and simulations, finding typical
deviations of order +/- 10-20% near the edges of the main lobe and in the
sidelobes. We consider the ramifications of these results for image- and power
spectrum-based science. In particular, we simulate visibilities measured by a
100m baseline and find that using an otherwise perfect foreground model,
unmodeled beamforming errors severely limit foreground subtraction accuracy
within the region of Fourier space contaminated by foreground emission (the
""wedge""). This region likely contains much of the cosmological signal, and
accessing it will require measurement of per-antenna beam patterns. However,
unmodeled beamforming errors do not contaminate the Fourier space region
expected to be free of foreground contamination (the ""EOR window""), showing
that foreground avoidance remains a viable strategy.

origins are viable because explosive H burning in the two stellar sites could
result in quite similar proton-capture isotopic signatures. Three of the grains

inclusion of a time reversed sector and a nonconservative generalized
potential. We assume that this potential is invariant under the symmetries of
the initial conservative system. The breaking occurs because the time reversed
sector requires inverse symmetry transformations, under which the
nonconservative potential is not invariant. The resulting violation of the
conservation laws is consistent with the equations of motion. We generalize
this formulation for fermionic and sypersymmetric systems. In the case of a
supersymmetric oscillator, the effect of damping is that the bosonic and
fermionic components become different frequencies. Considering that initially
the nonconservative action is invariant under supersymmetry, and that the
breaking is associated to an instability, this result is reminiscent of
spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Teff~10000-28000K with diversified rotational velocities (vesini~ 0-250km/s)
were determined from the OI triplet lines at 7771-5A, with an aim to examine
whether this OI feature can be a reliable abundance indicator for such
high-temperature stars including rapid rotators. It revealed that the required
non-LTE abundance correction is distinctly large (ranging from ~-0.6dex to
~-1.7dex) and its consideration is indispensable. On the condition that the
non-LTE effect is taken into account, this triplet is a useful O abundance
indicator (with a precision of <~0.2dex) up to Teff <~25000K, since its total
equivalent width is sufficiently large (>~200mA). In contrast, it is not
adequate for abundance derivation for stars at Teff >~25000K, where its
strength rapidly drops down toward a hardly detectable level (except for
sharp-lined stars) and its sensitivity to Teff or log g becomes considerably
large. The resulting non-LTE oxygen abundances turned out to be almost normal
(i.e., near-solar around ~8.7-8.8 within +/-~0.2dex) for most stars without any
dependence upon projected rotational velocity as well as luminosity (or mass),
which is consistent with the prediction of recent stellar evolution
calculations.

  Equation of State","21 pages, 12 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For more than two decades, a single model for the spreading of a
surfactant-driven thin liquid film has dominated the applied mathematics
literature on the subject. Recently, through the use of fluorescently-tagged
lipids, it has become possible to make direct, quantitative comparisons between
experiments and models. These comparisons have revealed two important
discrepancies between simulations and experiments: the spatial distribution of
the surfactant layer, and the timescale over which spreading occurs. In this
paper, we present numerical simulations that demonstrate the impact of the
particular choice of the equation of state (EoS) relating the surfactant
concentration to the surface tension. Previous choices of the model EoS have
been an ad-hoc decreasing function. Here, we instead propose an
empirically-motivated equation of state; this provides a route to resolving
some discrepancies and raises new issues to be pursued in future experiments.
In addition, we test the influence of the choice of initial conditions and
values for the non-dimensional groups. We demonstrate that the choice of EoS
improves the agreement in surfactant distribution morphology between
simulations and experiments, and impacts the dynamics of the simulations. The
relevant feature of the EoS, the gradient, has distinct regions for empirically
motivated choices, which suggests that future work will need to consider more
than one timescale. We observe that the non-dimensional number controlling the
relative importance of gravitational vs. capillary forces has a larger impact
on the dynamics than the other non-dimensional groups. Finally, we observe that
the experimental approach of using a ring to contain the surfactant could
affect the surfactant and fluid dynamics if it disrupts the intended initial
surfactant distribution. However, the meniscus itself does not significantly
affect the dynamics.

2-10 keV band place fundamental constraints on various types of X-ray sources
in the Milky Way. Although the primarily discrete origin of the emission is now
well established, the responsible populations of these sources remain
uncertain, especially at relatively low fluxes. To provide insights into this
issue, we systematically characterize the Fe emission line properties of the
candidate types of the sources in the solar neighborhood and compare them with
those measured for the GRXE. Our source sample includes 6 symbiotic stars
(SSs), 16 intermediate polars (IPs), 3 polars, 16 quiescent dwarf novae (DNe)
and 4 active binaries (ABs). We find that the mean equivalent width
($EW_{6.7}$) of the 6.7-keV line and the mean 7.0/6.7-keV line ratio are
$107\pm16.0$ eV and $0.71\pm 0.04$ for intermediate polars and $221\pm 135$ eV
and $0.44\pm 0.14$ for polars, respectively, which are all substantially
different from those ($490\pm15 $~eV and $0.2\pm 0.08$) for the GRXE. Instead,
the GRXE values are better agreed by the $EW_{6.7}$ ($438\pm 84.6$~eV) and the
ratio ($0.27\pm 0.06$) observed for the DNe.
  We further find that the $EW_{6.7}$ is strongly correlated with the 2-10-keV
luminosity of the DNe, which can be characterized by the relation
$EW_{6.7}=(438\pm95 {\rm~eV}) (L/10^{31}~{\rm~ergs~s^{-1} })^{(-0.31\pm0.15)}$.
Accounting for this correlation, the agreement can be improved further,
especially when the contributions from other classes sources to the GRXE are
considered, which all have low $EW_{6.7}$ values. We conclude that the GRXE
mostly consists of typically faint, but numerous DNe, plus ABs, while magnetic
CVs are probably mainly the high-flux representatives of the responsible
populations and dominate the GRXE only in harder energy bands.

pore-scale fluid mixing is governed by the interplay between chaotic advection,
molecular diffusion and the broad (power-law) distribution of fluid particle
travel times which arise from the non-slip condition at pore walls. To
understand and quantify mixing in 3D porous media, we consider these processes

$L_{\rm crit}=L_c$ for the bipartite systems having a single qubit as one of

carried out using structured codes such as linear codes and group codes. We

by irregularity, irreversibility, energy fluctuations across many scales, and
energy transfer across many scales. Another fundamental and generic feature of
turbulence, although sometimes overlooked, is the inhomogeneous dissipation of
energy in space and in time. This is a consequence of intermittency, the
scale-dependent inhomogeneity of dynamics caused by fluctuations in the
turbulent cascade. Intermittency causes turbulent plasmas to self-organize into
coherent dissipative structures, which may govern heating, diffusion, particle
acceleration, and radiation emissions. In this paper, we present recent
progress on understanding intermittency in incompressible magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence with a strong guide field. We focus on the statistical analysis of
intermittent dissipative structures, which occupy a small fraction of the
volume but arguably account for the majority of energy dissipation. We show
that, in our numerical simulations, intermittent structures in the current
density, vorticity, and Els\""{a}sser vorticities all have nearly identical
statistical properties. We propose phenomenological explanations for the
scalings based on general considerations of Els\""{a}sser vorticity structures.
Finally, we examine the broader implications of intermittency for astrophysical
systems.

input is needed to improve nuclear models and reduce neutrino interaction
systematics which are currently dominating oscillation searches together with
neutrino flux uncertainties. A number of new detector concepts with diverse
neutrino beams and nuclear targets are currently being developed to provide
necessary inputs required for next generation oscillation experiments. This

neutrino-induced interaction will be major challenge for future direct dark

Effective Field Theory (EFT), which provides a well-motivated theoretical
framework for determining nuclear responses to dark matter scattering events.
We analyze the nuclear energy recoil spectra from the different dark
matter-nucleon EFT operators, and compare to the nuclear recoil energy spectra
that is predicted to be induced by astrophysical neutrino sources. We determine
that for 11 of the 14 possible operators, the dark matter-induced recoil
spectra can be cleanly distinguished from the corresponding neutrino-induced
recoil spectra with moderate size detector technologies that are now being
pursued, e.g., these operators would require 0.5 tonne years to be
distinguished from the neutrino background for low mass dark matter. Our
results imply that in most models detectors with good energy resolution will be
able to distinguish a dark matter signal from a neutrino signal, without the
need for much larger detectors that must rely on additional information from
timing or direction.

relatively dense networks of randomly oriented CNTs (CNT ""felt"") and predicts
the detector responsivity spectral characteristics. The detection mechanism is
the rectification of the ac current due the nonlinearity of the Schottky
contact current-voltage characteristics under the conditions of a strong
enhancement of the potential drop at this contact associated with the plasmon
excitation. We demonstrate that the excitation of the two-dimensional plasmons

peaks of the detector responsivity at the signal frequencies corresponding to
the plasmonic resonances. The detector responsivity depends on the fractions of
the s- and m-CNTs. The burning of the near-contact regions of the m-CNTs or
destruction of these CNTs leads to a marked increase in the responsivity in
agreement with our experimental data. The resonant THz detectors with
sufficiently dense lateral CNT networks can compete and surpass other THz
detectors using plasmonic effects at room temperatures.

a new task, Label Noise Reduction in Entity Typing (LNR), to be the automatic
identification of correct type labels (type-paths) for training examples, given
the set of candidate type labels obtained by distant supervision with a given
type hierarchy. The unknown type labels for individual entity mentions and the
semantic similarity between entity types pose unique challenges for solving the
LNR task. We propose a general framework, called PLE, to jointly embed entity
mentions, text features and entity types into the same low-dimensional space
where, in that space, objects whose types are semantically close have similar
representations. Then we estimate the type-path for each training example in a
top-down manner using the learned embeddings. We formulate a global objective
for learning the embeddings from text corpora and knowledge bases, which adopts
a novel margin-based loss that is robust to noisy labels and faithfully models
type correlation derived from knowledge bases. Our experiments on three public

combination may allow one to determine an approximate location and occasionally

role in electron acceleration during magnetic reconnection. In this paper,
two-dimensional (2-D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are performed to study
electron acceleration during multiple X line reconnection with a guide field.
The electrons remain almost magnetized, and we can then analyze the
contributions of the parallel electric field, Fermi and betatron mechanisms to
electron acceleration during the evolution of magnetic reconnection by
comparing with a guide-center theory. The results show that with the proceeding
of magnetic reconnection, two magnetic islands are formed in the simulation
domain. The electrons are accelerated by both the parallel electric field in
the vicinity of the X lines and Fermi mechanism due to the contraction of the
two magnetic islands. Then the two magnetic islands begin to merge into one,
and in such a process electrons can be accelerated by the parallel electric
field and betatron mechanisms. During the betatron acceleration, the electrons
are locally accelerated in the regions where the magnetic field is piled up by
the high-speed flow from the X line. At last, when the coalescence of the two
islands into a big one finishes, electrons can further be accelerated by the
Fermi mechanism because of the contraction of the big island. With the increase
of the guide field, the contributions of Fermi and betatron mechanisms to
electron acceleration become less and less important. When the guide field is
sufficiently large, the contributions of Fermi and betatron mechanisms are
almost negligible.

Josephson junctions embedded in a variety of superconducting circuits. In 1980
a theoretical conjecture by A.J. Leggett suggested a possible new and quite
different behavior for Josephson junctions at very low temperatures. A number
of experiments seemed to confirm this prediction and soon it was taken as a
given that junctions at tens of millikelvins should be regarded as macroscopic
quantum entities. As such, they would possess discrete levels in their
effective potential wells, and would escape from those wells (with the
appearance of a finite junction voltage) via a macroscopic quantum tunneling
process. A zeal to pursue this new physics led to a virtual abandonment of the
RCSJ model in this low temperature regime. In this paper we consider a
selection of essentially prototypical experiments that were carried out with
the intention of confirming aspects of anticipated macroscopic quantum behavior
in Josephson junctions. We address two questions: (1) How successful is the
non-quantum theory (RCSJ model) in replicating those experiments? (2) How
strong is the evidence that data from these same experiments does indeed

new layered superconductor family since 2012. Due to the rich variation of
crystal structure and constituent elements, the development of new physics and
chemistry of the layered Bi-chalcogenide family and its applications as
functional materials have been expected. Recently, it was revealed that the
layered Bi chalcogenides can show a relatively high thermoelectric performance
(ZT = 0.36 in LaOBiSSe at ~650 K). Here, we show the crystal structure
variation of the Bi-chalcogenide family and their thermoelectric properties.
Finally, the possible strategies for enhancing the thermoelectric performance
are discussed on the basis of the experimental and the theoretical facts

switching is driven by an unobservable Markov chain, are widely-used in
financial applications, due to their tractability and good econometric
properties. In this work we consider HMMs in continuous time with both constant
and switching volatility. In the continuous-time model with switching
volatility the underlying Markov chain could be observed due to this stochastic
volatility, and no estimation (filtering) of it is needed (in theory), while in
the discretized model or the model with constant volatility one has to filter
for the underlying Markov chain. The motivations for continuous-time models are
explicit computations in finance. To have a realistic model with unobservable
Markov chain in continuous time and good econometric properties we introduce a
regime-switching model where the volatility depends on the filter for the
underlying chain and state the filtering equations. We prove an approximation
result for a fixed information filtration and further motivate the model by
considering social learning arguments. We analyze its relation to the switching
volatility model and present a convergence result for the discretized model. We
then illustrate its econometric properties by considering numerical

Our minimalistic solution is well suited for scaling with leading-edge link

provide advanced control of TCP congestion in high-speed links and in low-power

For assessing model parameters, we analyze a limited data set of PM$_{2.5}$
levels of Beijing, Tianjin, Chengde, Hengshui, and Xingtai. This process
reveals a better fit for the t-copula dependence structure with generalized
hyperbolic marginal distributions for the PM$_{2.5}$ log-ratios of the cities.
Furthermore, we show how to efficiently simulate risk measures
clean-air-at-risk and conditional clean-air-at-risk using importance sampling
and stratified importance sampling. Our numerical results show that
clean-air-at-risk at 0.01 probability level reaches up to 352 {\mu}gm-3
(initial PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations of cities are assumed to be 100 {\mu}gm-3)

conditional excesses.

star-forming regions in four extremely metal poor (EMP) galaxies with
metallicity Z around Zsun/10 as observed by the Herschel Space Observatory.
With the good wavelength coverage of the SED, it is found that these EMP
star-forming regions show distinct SED shapes as compared to those of grand
design Spirals and higher metallicity dwarfs: they have on average much higher
f70um/f160um ratios at a given f160um/f250um ratio; single modified black-body
(MBB) fittings to the SED at \lambda >= 100 um still reveal higher dust
temperatures and lower emissivity indices compared to that of Spirals, while
two MBB fittings to the full SED with a fixed emissivity index (beta = 2) show
that even at 100 um about half of the emission comes from warm (50 K) dust, in
contrast to the cold (~20 K) dust component. Our spatially resolved images
further reveal that the far-IR colors including f70um/f160um, f160um/f250um and
f250um/f350um are all related to the surface densities of young stars as traced
by far-UV, 24 um and SFRs, but not to the stellar mass surface densities. This
suggests that the dust emitting at wavelengths from 70 um to 350 um is
primarily heated by radiation from young stars.

investigated the gas phase formation and the recondensation of the complex
organic molecules (COMs) di-methyl ether and methyl formate, induced by sudden
ice evaporation processes occurring during luminosity outbursts of different
amplitudes in protostellar envelopes. For this purpose, we updated a gas phase
chemical network forming complex organic molecules in which ammonia plays a key
role. The model calculations presented here demonstrate that ion-molecule
reactions alone could account for the observed presence of di-methyl ether and
methyl formate in a large fraction of protostellar cores, without recourse to
grain-surface chemistry, although they depend on uncertain ice abundances and
gas phase reaction branching ratios. In spite of the short outburst timescales
of about one hundred years, abundance ratios of the considered species with
respect to methanol higher than 10 % are predicted during outbursts due to
their low binding energies relative to water and methanol that delay their
recondensation during the cooling. Although the current luminosity of most
embedded protostars would be too low to produce these complex species in hot
core regions that can be observable with current sub-millimetric
interferometers, previous luminosity outburst events would induce a formation
of COMs in extended regions of protostellar envelopes with sizes increasing by
up to one order of magnitude.

concurrent programming alternative to lock-based synchronizations. However,
most TM models admit only isolated transactions, which are not adequate in
multi-threaded programming where transactions have to interact via shared data
before committing. In this paper, we present Open Transactional Memory (OTM), a
programming abstraction supporting safe, data-driven interactions between
composable memory transactions. This is achieved by relaxing isolation between
transactions, still ensuring atomicity: threads of different transactions can
interact by accessing shared variables, but then their transactions have to
commit together-actually, these transactions are transparently merged. This
model allows for loosely-coupled interactions since transaction merging is
driven only by accesses to shared data, with no need to specify participants
beforehand. In this paper we provide a specification of the OTM in the setting
of Concurrent Haskell, showing that it is a conservative extension of current
STM abstraction. In particular, we provide a formal semantics, which allows us
to prove that OTM satisfies the \emph{opacity} criterion.

of ultrathin TMDs materials is of primary importance for fundamental study and
practical applications. Raman mode intensity from substrates has been used to
identify N of intrinsic and defective multilayer graphenes up to N=100.
However, such analysis is not applicable for ultrathin TMD flakes due to the
lack of a unified complex refractive index ($\tilde{n}$) from monolayer to bulk
TMDs. Here, we discuss the N identification of TMD flakes on the SiO$_2$/Si
substrate by the intensity ratio between the Si peak from 100-nm (or 89-nm)
SiO$_2$/Si substrates underneath TMD flakes and that from bare SiO$_2$/Si
substrates. We assume the real part of $\tilde{n}$ of TMD flakes as that of
monolayer TMD and treat the imaginary part of $\tilde{n}$ as a fitting
parameter to fit the experimental intensity ratio. An empirical $\tilde{n}$,
namely, $\tilde{n}_{eff}$, of ultrathin MoS$_{2}$, WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$
flakes from monolayer to multilayer is obtained for typical laser excitations
(2.54 eV, 2.34 eV, or 2.09 eV). The fitted $\tilde{n}_{eff}$ of MoS$_{2}$ has
been used to identify N of MoS$_{2}$ flakes deposited on 302-nm SiO$_2$/Si
substrate, which agrees well with that determined from their shear and
layer-breathing modes. This technique by measuring Raman intensity from the
substrate can be extended to identify N of ultrathin 2D flakes with N-dependent
$\tilde{n}$ . For the application purpose, the intensity ratio excited by
specific laser excitations has been provided for MoS$_{2}$, WS$_{2}$ and
WSe$_{2}$ flakes and multilayer graphene flakes deposited on Si substrates

processes. In order to better interpret experimental studies of low Reynolds
number swimming, we combine experimental and numerical methods to perform an
analysis of the flow-field around the swimming nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.
We first use image processing and particle tracking velocimetry to extract the
body shape, kinematics, and flow-fields around the nematode. We then construct
a three-dimensional model using the experimental swimming kinematics and employ
a boundary element method to simulate flow-fields, obtaining very good
quantitative agreement with experiment. We use this numerical model to show
that calculation of flow shear rates using purely planar data results in
significant underestimates of the true three-dimensional value. Applying
symmetry arguments, validated against numerics, we demonstrate that the
out-of-plane contribution can be accounted for via incompressibility and
therefore simply calculated from particle tracking velocimetry. Our results
show how fundamental fluid mechanics considerations may be used to improve the
accuracy of measurements in biofluiddynamics.

are influenced by couplings between the relative motion and nuclear intrinsic
degrees of freedom of the colliding nuclei. The time-dependent Hartree-Fock
(TDHF) theory, incorporating the couplings at the mean-field level, as well as
the coupled-channels (CC) method are standard approaches to describe low energy
nuclear reactions.
  Purpose: To investigate the effect of couplings to inelastic and transfer
channels on the fusion cross sections for the reactions $^{40}$Ca+$^{58}$Ni and
$^{40}$Ca+$^{64}$Ni.
  Methods: Fusion cross sections around and below the Coulomb barrier have been
obtained from coupled-channels (CC) calculations, using the bare
nucleus-nucleus potential calculated with the frozen Hartree-Fock method and
coupling parameters taken from known nuclear structure data. The fusion
thresholds and neutron transfer probabilities have been calculated with the
TDHF method.
  Results: For $^{40}$Ca+$^{58}$Ni, the TDHF fusion threshold is in agreement
with the most probable barrier obtained in the CC calculations including the
couplings to the low-lying octupole $3_1^{-}$ state for $^{40}$Ca and to the
low-lying quadrupole $2_1^{+}$ state for $^{58}$Ni. This indicates that the
octupole and quadrupole states are the dominant excitations while neutron
transfer is shown to be weak. For $^{40}$Ca+$^{64}$Ni, the TDHF barrier is
lower than predicted by the CC calculations including the same inelastic
couplings as those for $^{40}$Ca+$^{58}$Ni. TDHF calculations show large
neutron transfer probabilities in $^{40}$Ca+$^{64}$Ni which could result in a
lowering of the fusion threshold.
  Conclusions: Inelastic channels play an important role in $^{40}$Ca+$^{58}$Ni
and $^{40}$Ca+$^{64}$Ni reactions. The role of neutron transfer channels has
been highlighted in $^{40}$Ca+$^{64}$Ni.

substantial proportion of patients. For these patients, an immunotherapy based
on injections of Interleukin 7 (IL-7) has been recently proposed as a
co-adjutant treatment in the hope of obtaining long-term reconstitution of the
T cells pool. Several questions arise as to the long-term efficiency of this
treatment and the best protocol to apply.
  We develop a model based on a system of ordinary differential equations and a
statistical model of variability and measurement. We can estimate key
parameters of this model using the data from INSPIRE, INSPIRE 2 $\&$ INSPIRE 3
trials. In all three studies, cycles of three injections have been
administered; in the last two studies, for the first time, repeated cycles of
exogenous IL-7 have been administered. Our aim was to estimate the possible
different effects of successive injections in a cycle, to estimate the effect
of repeated cycles and to assess different protocols.
  The use of dynamical models together with our complex statistical approach
allow us to analyze major biological questions. We found a strong effect of
IL-7 injections on the proliferation rate; however, the effect of the third
injection of the cycle appears to be much weaker than the first ones. Also,
despite a slightly weaker effect of repeated cycles with respect to the initial
one, our simulations show the ability of this treatment of maintaining adequate
CD4$^+$ T cells count for years. We were also able to compare different
protocols, showing that cycles of two injections should be sufficient in most
cases. %Finally, we also explore the possibility of adaptive protocols.

the solution of known positions so far (up to the 10 x 10 board) much quicker
(measured in number of investigated nodes).
  More importantly, it enables the solution of the 11 x 11 Domineering board, a
board up till now far out of reach of previous Domineering solvers. The
solution needed the investigation of 259,689,994,008 nodes, using almost half a
year of computation time on a single simple desktop computer. The results show
that under optimal play the first player wins the 11 x 11 Domineering game,
irrespective if Vertical or Horizontal starts the game.
  In addition, several other boards hitherto unsolved were solved. Using the
convention that Vertical starts, the 8 x 15, 11 x 9, 12 x 8, 12 x 15, 14 x 8,

ontic approach to inter-theoretic relationships. Our stance stresses the fact
that physical theories require the necessary consideration of a conceptual
level of discourse which determines and configures the specific field of
phenomena discussed by each particular theory. We will criticize the orthodox
line of research which has grounded the analysis about QM in two (Bohrian)
metaphysical presuppositions -accepted in the present as dogmas that all
interpretations must follow. We will also examine how the orthodox project of
""bridging the gap"" between the quantum and the classical domains has
constrained the possibilities of research, producing only a limited set of
interpretational problems which only focus in the justification of ""classical
reality"" and exclude the possibility of analyzing the possibilities of
non-classical conceptual representations of QM. The representational realist
stance introduces two new problems, namely, the superposition problem and the
contextuality problem, which consider explicitly the conceptual representation
of orthodox QM beyond the mere reference to mathematical structures and
measurement outcomes. In the final part of the paper, we revisit, from a
representational realist perspective, the quantum to classical limit and the
orthodox claim that this inter-theoretic relation can be explained through the
principle of decoherence.

the classical limits imposed on precision in the canonical phase estimation

of precision even when allowing for local unitary optimization. Conversely, we
show that random states from the symmetric subspace typically achieve the
optimal Heisenberg scaling without the need for local unitary optimization.
Surprisingly, the Heisenberg scaling is observed for states of arbitrarily low
purity and preserved under finite particle losses. Moreover, we prove that for
such states a standard photon-counting interferometric measurement suffices to
typically achieve the Heisenberg scaling of precision for all possible values
of the phase at the same time. Finally, we demonstrate that metrologically
useful states can be prepared with short random optical circuits generated from
three types of beam-splitters and a non-linear (Kerr-like) transformation.

data sets, it seemed important to provide the astronomical community with an
instrument able to fill this gap. Besides the problem of moving massive data
sets over the network, another critical point is that a great part of
astronomical data is stored in private archives that are not fully accessible
on line. So, in order to evaluate photo-z it is needed a desktop application
that can be downloaded and used by everyone locally, i.e. on his own personal
computer or more in general within the local intranet hosted by a data center.
The name chosen for the application is PhotoRApToR, i.e. Photometric Research
Application To Redshift (Cavuoti et al. 2015, 2014; Brescia 2014b). It embeds a
machine learning algorithm and special tools dedicated to preand
post-processing data. The ML model is the MLPQNA (Multi Layer Perceptron
trained by the Quasi Newton Algorithm), which has been revealed particularly
powerful for the photo-z calculation on the base of a spectroscopic sample
(Cavuoti et al. 2012; Brescia et al. 2013, 2014a; Biviano et al. 2013).
  The PhotoRApToR program package is available, for different platforms, at the

expressed as finite-valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSPs), we
establish a dichotomy on the number of levels of the Lasserre hierarchy of
semi-definite programs (SDPs) that are required to solve the problem exactly.
In particular, we show that if a finite-valued constraint problem is not solved
exactly by its basic linear programming relaxation, it is also not solved
exactly by any sub-linear number of levels of the Lasserre hierarchy. The lower
bounds are established through logical undefinability results. We show that the
linear programming relaxation of the problem, as well as the SDP corresponding
to any fixed level of the Lasserre hierarchy is interpretable in a VCSP
instance by means of formulas of fixed-point logic with counting. We also show
that the solution of an SDP can be expressed in this logic. Together, these
results give a way of translating lower bounds on the number of variables
required in counting logic to express a VCSP into lower bounds on the number of
levels required in the Lasserre hierarchy to eliminate the integrality gap. As
a special case, we obtain the same dichotomy for the class of MAXCSP problems,
generalizing some earlier Lasserre lower bound results of Schoenebeck.

Lyapunov dimension there is an effective analytical approach, proposed by G.A.
Leonov in 1991. The Leonov method is based on the direct Lyapunov method with
special Lyapunov-like functions. The advantage of this method is that it allows
one to estimate the Lyapunov dimension of invariant set without local- ization
of the set in the phase space and in many cases get effectively exact Lyapunov
dimension formula. In this survey the invariance of Lyapunov dimension with
respect to diffeomorphisms and its connection with the Leonov method are
discussed. An analog of Leonov method for discrete time dynamical systems is
suggested. In a simple but rigorous way, here it is presented the connection
between the Leonov method and the key related works in the area: by Kaplan and
Yorke (the concept of Lyapunov dimension, 1979), Douady and Oesterle (upper
bounds of Hausdorff dimension via the Lyapunov dimension of maps, 1980),
Constantin, Eden, Foias, and Temam (upper bounds of Hausdorff dimension via the
Lyapunov exponents and dimension of dynamical systems, 1985-90), and the
numerical calculation of the Lyapunov exponents and dimension.

given the significantly better angular resolution of neutrino events compared
to gravitational waves. We find no neutrino candidates in both temporal and
spatial coincidence with the gravitational wave event. Within 500 s of the
gravitational wave event, the number of neutrino candidates detected by IceCube
and ANTARES were three and zero, respectively. This is consistent with the
expected atmospheric background, and none of the neutrino candidates were
directionally coincident with GW150914. We use this non-detection to constrain
neutrino emission from the gravitational-wave event.

Globular Cluster (GC) NGC 2808 in the framework of the asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) scenario. The chemistry of the five -or more- populations is
approximately consistent with a sequence of star formation events, starting
after the supernovae type II epoch, lasting approximately until the time when
the third dredge up affects the AGB evolution (age ~90-120Myr), and ending when
the type Ia supernovae begin exploding in the cluster, eventually clearing it
from the gas. The formation of the different populations requires episodes of
star formation in AGB gas diluted with different amounts of pristine gas. In
the nitrogen-rich, helium-normal population identified in NGC 2808 by the UV
Legacy Survey of GCs, the nitrogen increase is due to the third dredge up in
the smallest mass AGB ejecta involved in the star formation of this population.
The possibly-iron-rich small population in NGC 2808 may be a result of
contamination by a single type Ia supernova. The NGC 2808 case is used to build
a general framework to understand the variety of 'second generation' stars
observed in GCs. Cluster-to-cluster variations are ascribed to differences in
the effects of the many processes and gas sources which may be involved in the
formation of the second generation. We discuss an evolutionary scheme, based on
pollution by delayed type II supernovae, which accounts for the properties of
s-Fe-anomalous clusters.

off how the parameters of the model, the topology of the graph and, possibly,
the initial diffusion of the asset, determine whether the spread of the asset
is successful or not. In particular, by means of stochastic dominations and
deterministic approximations, we provide some general results for a large class
of expansive graphs. Finally we present numerical simulations trying to expand

PhD thesis. v2: updated refereces",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding supersymmetric flux vacua is essential in order to connect
string theory to observable physics. In this thesis, flux vacua are studied by
making use of two mathematical frameworks: SU(n)-structures and generalised
complex geometry. Manifolds with SU(n)-structure are generalisations of
Calabi-Yau manifolds. Generalised complex geometry is a geometrical framework
that simultaneously generalises complex and symplectic geometry. Classes of
flux vacua of type II supergravity and M-theory are given on manifolds with
SU(4)-structure. The N= (1,1) type IIA vacua uplift to N=1 M-theory vacua, with
four-flux that need not be (2,2) and primitive. Explicit vacua are given on
Stenzel space, a non-compact Calabi-Yau. These are then generalised by
constructing families of non-CY SU(4)-structures to find vacua on
non-symplectic SU(4)-deformed Stenzel spaces. It is shown that the
supersymmetry conditions for N = (2,0) type IIB can be rephrased in the
language of generalised complex geometry, partially in terms of integrability
conditions of generalised almost complex structures. This rephrasing for d=2
goes beyond the calibration equations, in contrast to d=4,6 where the
calibration equations are equivalent to supersymmetry. Finally, Euclidean type
II theory is examined on SU(5)-structure manifolds, where generalised equations
are found which are necessary but not sufficient to satisfy the supersymmetry
equations. Explicit classes of solutions are provided here as well. Contact
with Lorentzian physics can be made by uplifting such solutions to d=1, N=1
M-theory.

many scientific and engineering applications. Here, a cluster-based control
framework is proposed to determine optimal control laws with respect to a cost
function for unsteady flows. The proposed methodology frames high-dimensional,
nonlinear dynamics into low-dimensional, probabilistic, linear dynamics which
considerably simplifies the optimal control problem while preserving nonlinear
actuation mechanisms. The data-driven approach builds upon a state space
discretization using a clustering algorithm which groups kinematically similar
flow states into a low number of clusters. The temporal evolution of the
probability distribution on this set of clusters is then described by a Markov
model. The Markov model can be used as predictor for the ergodic probability
distribution for a particular control law. This probability distribution
approximates the long-term behavior of the original system on which basis the
optimal control law is determined. The approach is applied to a separating flow
dominated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz shedding.

its partition function as the (logarithm of the) tau-function of the string
solution and show that it satisfies various properties (string, dilaton and
divisor equations plus some important degree constraints). We then formulate a
stronger version of the conjecture from [Bur15]: for any semisimple
cohomological field theory, the Dubrovin-Zhang and double ramification
hierarchies are related by a normal (i.e. preserving the tau-structure
[DLYZ14]) Miura transformation which we completely identify in terms of the
partition function of the CohFT. In fact, using only the partition functions,
the conjecture can be formulated even in the non-semisimple case (where the
Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchy is not defined). We then prove this conjecture for
various CohFTs (trivial CohFT, Hodge class, Gromov-Witten theory of
$\mathbb{CP}^1$, $3$-, $4$- and $5$-spin classes) and in genus $1$ for any
semisimple CohFT. Finally we prove that the higher genus part of the DR

and stability of the magnetic fields created by $RE$BCO coated conductor coils.
They are responsible for the AC loss, which is also important for other power
applications containing windings. Since real magnets contain coils exceeding
10000 turns, accurate modeling tools for this number of turns are necessary for
magnet design. This article presents a fast numerical method to model coils
with no loss of accuracy. We model a 10400-turn coil for its real geometry and
coils of up to 40000 turns with the continuous approximation, which we checked
that introduces negligible errors. The screening currents, the Screening
Current Induced Field (SCIF) and the AC loss is analyzed in detail. The SCIF is
maximum at the remnant state with a considerably large value and decreases
substantially after one day of relaxation. The instantaneous AC loss for an
anisotropic magnetic-field dependent $J_c$ is qualitatively different than for
a constant $J_c$, although the loss per cycle is similar. Saturation of the
magnetization currents at the end pancakes causes that the maximum AC loss at
the first ramp increases with $J_c$. The presented modeling tool can accurately
calculate the SCIF and AC loss in practical computing times for coils with any
number of turns used in real windings, enabling parameter optimization.

of ${\cal P}$, can be properly $\chi$-colored. The decomposition ${\cal P}$ is
said to be strong (resp., weak) if each of the clusters has strong (resp.,

every two vertices $u,v \in C$, the distance between them in the induced graph
$G(C)$ of $C$ (resp., in $G$) is at most $D$.
  Network decomposition is a powerful construct, very useful in distributed
computing and beyond. It was shown by Awerbuch \etal \cite{AGLP89} and
Panconesi and Srinivasan \cite{PS92}, that strong $(2^{O(\sqrt{\log
n})},2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})})$ network decompositions can be computed in
$2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}$ distributed time. Linial and Saks \cite{LS93} devised an
ingenious randomized algorithm that constructs {\em weak} $(O(\log n),O(\log
n))$ network decompositions in $O(\log^2 n)$ time. It was however open till now
if {\em strong} network decompositions with both parameters $2^{o(\sqrt{\log
n})}$ can be constructed in distributed $2^{o(\sqrt{\log n})}$ time.
  In this paper we answer this long-standing open question in the affirmative,
and show that strong $(O(\log n),O(\log n))$ network decompositions can be
computed in $O(\log^2 n)$ time. We also present a tradeoff between parameters
of our network decomposition. Our work is inspired by and relies on the
""shifted shortest path approach"", due to Blelloch \etal \cite{BGKMPT11}, and
Miller \etal \cite{MPX13}. These authors developed this approach for PRAM
algorithms for padded partitions. We adapt their approach to network
decompositions in the distributed model of computation.

thereby neglecting the effect of the interference between the additional
Z'-bosons and the Standard Model Z and {\gamma}. Recently, it has been
established that both finite width and interference effects can be dealt with
in experimental searches while still retaining the model independent approach
ensured by the NWA. This assessment has been made for the case of popular
single Z'-boson models currently probed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider

above issues for some benchmark multi Z'-boson models. In particular, we
consider Non-Universal Extra Dimensional (NUED) scenarios and the 4-Dimensional
Composite Higgs Model (4DCHM), both predicting a multi-Z' peaking structure. We
conclude that in a variety of cases, specifically those in which the leptonic
decays modes of one or more of the heavy neutral gauge bosons are suppressed
and/or significant interference effects exist between these or with the
background, especially present when their decay widths are significant,
traditional search approaches based on the assumption of rather narrow and

survey and administered it to more than 200 students at 10 institutions. The
issues targeted in the survey include the set of possible wavefunctions, bound
and scattering states, quantum measurement, expectation values, the role of the
Hamiltonian, and the time-dependence of the wavefunction and expectation
values. We find that undergraduate and graduate students have many common
difficulties with these concepts and that research-based tutorials and

as $\eta=r_i/r_o=0.909$, the inner cylinder Reynolds number was fixed to
$Re_i=3.4\cdot10^4$, and the outer cylinder was kept stationary, resulting in a
frictional Reynolds number of $Re_\tau\approx500$, except for the $\Gamma=14$

that maximizes the nonlocality of correlations with respect to some suitable
measure such as the violation of Bell inequalities. The latter has however some
drawbacks. First and foremost it is unfeasible to determine the whole set of
Bell inequalities already for a few measurements and thus unfeasible to find
the experimental setup maximizing their violation. Second, the Bell violation
suffers from an ambiguity stemming from the choice of the normalization of the
Bell coefficients. An alternative measure of nonlocality with a direct
information-theoretic interpretation is the minimal amount of classical
communication required for simulating nonlocal correlations. In the case of
many instances simulated in parallel, the minimal communication cost per
instance is called nonlocal capacity, and its computation can be reduced to a
convex-optimization problem. This quantity can be computed for a higher number
of measurements and turns out to be useful for finding the optimal experimental
setup. Focusing on the bipartite case, in this paper, we present a simple
method for maximizing the nonlocal capacity over a given configuration space
and, in particular, over a set of possible measurements, yielding the
corresponding optimal setup. Furthermore, we show that there is a functional
relationship between Bell violation and nonlocal capacity. The method is
illustrated with numerical tests and compared with the maximization of the
violation of CGLMP-type Bell inequalities on the basis of entangled two-qubit
as well as two-qutrit states. Remarkably, the anomaly of nonlocality displayed
by qutrits turns out to be even stronger if the nonlocal capacity is employed
as a measure of nonlocality.

and is absorbed upon collision with the target boundary. When reaching the
domain boundary, the searcher chooses a random direction for its new
trajectory. For circular domains and targets, we can approximate the mean first
passage time (MFPT) using a Markov chain approximation of the search process.
Our analysis and numerical simulations reveal that the time to find the target
decreases for targets closer to the domain boundary. When there is a small
probability of direction-switching within the domain, we find the time to find
the target decreases slightly with the turning probability. We also extend our
exit time analysis to the case of partitioned domains, where there is a single
target within one of multiple disjoint subdomains. Given an average time of
transition between domains $\langle T \rangle$, we find that the optimal rate
of transition that minimizes the time to find the target obeys $\beta_{{\rm
min}} \propto 1/ \sqrt{\langle T \rangle}$.

first International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) data release. We use Bayesian
methodology, performing model selection to determine the optimal description of
the stochastic signals present in each pulsar. In addition to spin-noise and
dispersion-measure (DM) variations, these models can include timing noise
unique to a single observing system, or frequency band. We show the improved
radio-frequency coverage and presence of overlapping data from different
observing systems in the IPTA data set enables us to separate both system and
band-dependent effects with much greater efficacy than in the individual PTA
data sets. For example, we show that PSR J1643$-$1224 has, in addition to DM
variations, significant band-dependent noise that is coherent between PTAs
which we interpret as coming from time-variable scattering or refraction in the
ionised interstellar medium. Failing to model these different contributions
appropriately can dramatically alter the astrophysical interpretation of the
stochastic signals observed in the residuals. In some cases, the spectral
exponent of the spin noise signal can vary from 1.6 to 4 depending upon the
model, which has direct implications for the long-term sensitivity of the
pulsar to a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background. By using a more
appropriate model, however, we can greatly improve a pulsar's sensitivity to
GWs. For example, including system and band-dependent signals in the PSR
J0437$-$4715 data set improves the upper limit on a fiducial GW background by
$\sim 60\%$ compared to a model that includes DM variations and spin-noise
only.

that binary black holes can be created in the universe, and includes the

massive stars, accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs (WDs), double WD
mergers, double neutron star (NS) mergers, and WD-NS mergers. Because the mass
of ejecta from these channels could be quite different, their light curves are
also expected to be diverse. We evaluate the dynamic evolution of optical
transients powered by millisecond magnetars. We find that the magnetar with
short spin-down timescale converts its rotational energy mostly into the
kinetic energy of the transient, while the energy of a magnetar with long
spin-down timescale goes into radiation of the transient. This leads us to
speculate that hypernovae could be powered by magnetars with short spin-down
timescales. At late times the optical transients will gradually evolve into a
nebular phase because of the photospheric recession. We treat the photosphere
and nebula separately because their radiation mechanisms are different. In some
cases the ejecta could be light enough that the magnetar can accelerate it to a
relativistic speed. It is well known that the peak luminosity of a supernova
(SN) occurs when the luminosity is equal to the instantaneous energy input
rate, as shown by Arnett (1979). We show that photospheric recession and
relativistic motion can modify this law. The photospheric recession always
leads to a delay of the peak time $t_{\mathrm{pk}}$ relative to the time
$t_{\times }$ at which the SN luminosity equals the instantaneous energy input
rate. Relativistic motion, however, may change this result significantly.

a radiating charge varies. The conventional wisdom is that the pitch angle does
not change during the radiation process. The argument is based on Larmor's
radiation formula, where in a synchrotron case the radiation power is along the
instantaneous direction of motion of the charge. Then the momentum loss will
also be parallel to that direction and therefore the pitch angle of the charge
would remain unaffected. The accordingly derived formulas for energy losses of
synchrotron electrons in radio galaxies are the standard text-book material for
the last 50 years. However, if we use the momentum transformation laws from
special relativity, then we find that the pitch angle of a radiating charge
varies. While the velocity component parallel to the magnetic field remains
unaffected, the perpendicular component does reduce in magnitude due to
radiative losses, implying a change in the pitch angle. This apparent paradox
is resolved when effects on the charge motion are calculated not from Larmor's
formula but from Lorentz's radiation reaction formula. We derive the exact
formulation by taking into account the change of the pitch angle due to
radiative losses. From this we first time derive the characteristic decay time
of synchrotron electrons over which they turn from highly relativistic into
mildly relativistic ones.

communications in the presence of eavesdroppers has increasingly being
investigated in literature. In parallel, scavenging energy from abient radio
signals for energy-constrained devices, namely \emph{wireless energy
harvesting} (WEH), has also drawn significant attention. Without relying on
external energy supply, the wireless-powered friendly jammer by WEH from
legitimate wireless devices is an effective approach to prolong their lifetime
and gain the flexibility in deployments. This paper studies the online
optimization of the placement and WEH of a set of friendly jammers in a
geographic location with the energy-efficiency (EE) consideration. We adopt a
simple ""time switching"" protocol where power transfer and jammer-assisted
secure communications occur in different time blocks when WEH requests are
launched. Our scheme has the following important advantages: 1) The proposed
online jammers placement and interfering power allocation to attack
eavesdroppers is the first distributed and scalable solutions within any
specified geographic region, 2) We model the WEH for jammers as a \emph{JAM-NET
lifetime maximization problem}, where online scheduling algorithms with
heterogeneous energy demands of each jammer (from energy sources) are designed,
3) Under our model, the problem of placing a minimum number of jammers with
distance-based power assignments is NP-hard, and near optimal PTAS
approximation algorithms are provided, 4) When durations of the eavesdropping
and legitimate communicating are available and the scenario is extended to the
multi-channels setting, our results are strengthened to see further improved EE
and reduced number of jammers. Simulations back up our theory.
