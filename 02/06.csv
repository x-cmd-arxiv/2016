the concept of holomorphic ideal, which allows one to define a blow-up in the
category of smooth manifolds. We then investigate which generalized complex
submanifolds are suitable for blowing up. Two classes naturally appear;
generalized Poisson submanifolds and generalized Poisson transversals,
submanifolds which look complex, respectively symplectic in transverse
directions. We show that generalized Poisson submanifolds carry a canonical
holomorphic ideal and give a necessary and sufficient condition for the
corresponding blow-up to be generalized complex. For the generalized Poisson
transversals we give a normal form for a neighborhood of the submanifold, and
use that to define a generalized complex blow-up, which is up to deformation
independent of choices.

therapeutic technique, developed over 100 years, and today over 50% of cancer
patients will undergo traditional X-ray radiotherapy. However, ionizing
radiation therapy is not the only option, as the high-energy photons delivering
their cell-killing radiation energy into cancerous tumor can lead to
significant damage to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor, located throughout
the beam's path. Therefore, in nowadays, advances in ionizing radiation therapy
are competitive to non-ionizing ones, as for example the laser light based
therapy, resulting in a synergism that has revolutionized medicine. The use of
non-invasive or minimally invasive (e.g. through flexible endoscopes)
therapeutic procedures in the management of patients represents a very
interesting treatment option. Moreover, as the major breakthrough in cancer
management is the individualized patient treatment, new biophotonic techniques,
e.g. photo-activated drug carriers, help the improvement of treatment efficacy
and/or normal tissue toxicity. Additionally, recent studies support that laser
technology progresses could revolutionize cancer proton therapy, by reducing
the cost of the needed installations. The aim of this review is to present some
laser-based future objectives for cancer radiation therapy, aiming to address
the relevant advances in the ionizing and non-ionizing radiation therapy, i.e.
protons and heavy ions therapy, as well as photodynamic targeted and molecular
therapies.

events near the disk center. In this paper, we analyze the magnetic field
evolution associated with the 2012 October 23 X1.8 flare in NOAA AR 11598 that
is close to the solar limb, using both the 45 s cadence line-of-sight and 12
minute cadence vector magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on
board Solar Dynamic Observatory. This flare is classified as a circular-ribbon
flare with spine-fan type magnetic topology containing a null point. In the
line-of-sight magnetograms, there are two apparent polarity inversion lines
(PIL). The PIL closer to the limb is affected more by the projection effect.
Between these two PILs there lie positive polarity magnetic fields, which are
surrounded by negative polarity fields outside the PILs. We find that after the
flare, both the apparent limb-ward and disk-ward negative fluxes decrease,
while the positive flux in-between increases. We also find that the horizontal
magnetic fields have a significant increase along the disk-ward PIL, while in
surrounding area, they decrease. Synthesizing the observed field changes, we
conclude that the magnetic fields collapse toward the surface above the
disk-ward PIL as depicted in the coronal implosion scenario, while the
peripheral field turns to a more vertical configuration after the flare. We
also suggest that this event is an asymmetric circular-ribbon flare: a flux
rope is likely present above the disk-ward PIL. Its eruption causes the
instability of the entire fan-spine structure and the implosion near that PIL.

that the effective Higgs potential develops an instability below the Planck
scale. If the energy scale of inflation is as high as the GUT scale,
inflationary quantum fluctuations of the Higgs field can easily destabilize the
standard electroweak vacuum and produce a lot of AdS domains. This
destabilization during inflation can be avoided if a relatively large
nonminimal Higgs-gravity or inflaton-Higgs coupling is introduced. Such
couplings generate a large effective mass term for the Higgs, which can raise
the effective Higgs potential and suppress the vacuum fluctuation of the Higgs
field. After primordial inflation, however, such effective masses drops rapidly
and the nonminimal Higgs-gravity or inflaton-Higgs coupling can cause large
fluctuations of the Higgs field to be generated via parametric resonance, thus
producing AdS domains in the preheating stage. Furthermore, thermal
fluctuations of the Higgs field cannot be neglected in the proceeding reheating
epoch. We discuss the Higgs vacuum fluctuations during inflation, preheating,
and reheating, and show that the Higgs metastability problem is severe unless
the energy scale of the inflaton potential is much lower than the GUT scale.

example of a Markov chain. The limiting stationary distribution of the Markov
chain represents the fraction of the time spent in each state during the
stochastic process. A standard way to compute this distribution for a random
walk on a finite set of states is to compute the Perron vector of the
associated transition matrix. There are algebraic analogues of this Perron
vector in terms of transition probability tensors of higher-order Markov
chains. These vectors are nonnegative, have dimension equal to the dimension of
the state space, and sum to one and are derived by making an algebraic
substitution in the equation for the joint-stationary distribution of a
higher-order Markov chains. Here, we present the spacey random walk, a
non-Markovian stochastic process whose stationary distribution is given by the
tensor eigenvector. The process itself is a vertex-reinforced random walk, and
its discrete dynamics are related to a continuous dynamical system. We analyze
the convergence properties of these dynamics and discuss numerical methods for
computing the stationary distribution. Finally, we provide several applications
of the spacey random walk model in population genetics, ranking, and clustering
data, and we use the process to analyze taxi trajectory data in New York. This
example shows definite non-Markovian structure.

regions where tree amplitudes are perfectly smooth. For example, a $2\to4$
gluon scattering process has a singularity in which each incoming gluon splits
into a pair of gluons, followed by a pair of $2\to2$ collisions between the
gluon pairs. This singularity mimics double parton scattering because it occurs
when the transverse momentum of a pair of outgoing gluons vanishes. The
singularity is logarithmic at fixed order in perturbation theory. We exploit
the duality between scattering amplitudes and polygonal Wilson loops to study
six-point amplitudes in this limit to high loop order in planar ${\cal N}=4$
super-Yang-Mills theory. The singular configuration corresponds to the limit in
which a hexagonal Wilson loop develops a self-crossing. The singular terms are
governed by an evolution equation, in which the hexagon mixes into a pair of
boxes; the mixing back is suppressed in the planar (large $N_c$) limit. Because
the kinematic dependence of the box Wilson loops is dictated by (dual)
conformal invariance, the complete kinematic dependence of the singular terms
for the self-crossing hexagon on the one nonsingular variable is determined to
all loop orders. The complete logarithmic dependence on the singular variable
can be obtained through nine loops, up to a couple of constants, using a
correspondence with the multi-Regge limit. As a byproduct, we obtain a simple
formula for the leading logs to all loop orders. We also show that, although
the MHV six-gluon amplitude is singular, remarkably, the transcendental
functions entering the non-MHV amplitude are finite in the same limit, at least
through four loops.

favorably at the \emph{individual} subject level because it requires spatial
transformations of DTI data that involve non-linear warping and reorientation
of the tensors. Although the commonly used reorientation strategies such as
finite strain and preservation of principle direction are expected to result in
adequate accuracy for voxel based analyses of DTI measures such as fractional
anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), the reorientations are not always exact

reorientation at individual voxel level accumulate and could potentially affect

for magnetic modeling of active regions. We use high-resolution images (0.1"")
from the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) in the Ca II 8542 A
line, the Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) instrument in the
H-alpha 6563 A line, the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) in the
2796 A line, and compare non-potential magnetic field models obtained from
those chromospheric images with those obtained from images of the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) in coronal (171 A, etc.) and in chromospheric (304 A)
wavelengths. Curvi-linear structures are automatically traced in those images
with the OCCULT-2 code, to which we forward-fitted magnetic field lines
computed with the Vertical-Current Approximation Non-Linear Force Free Field
(VCA-NLFFF) code. We find that the chromospheric images: (1) reveal crisp
curvi-linear structures (fibrils, loop segments, spicules) that are extremely
well-suited for constraining magnetic modeling; (2) that these curvi-linear
structures are field-aligned with the best-fit solution by a median
misalignment angle of ~4-7 deg; (3) the free energy computed from coronal data
may underestimate that obtained from cromospheric data by a factor of ~ 2-4,
(4) the height range of chromospheric features is confined to h ~ 4000$ km,
while coronal features are detected up to h ~ 35,000$ km; and (5) the
plasma-beta parameter is beta ~ 10^(-5)-10^(-1) for all traced features. We
conclude that chromospheric images reveal important magnetic structures that
are complementary to coronal images and need to be included in comprehensive
magnetic field models, a quest that is not accomodated in standard NLFFF codes.

AVL trees, red-black trees, weight balanced trees and treaps. We introduced
only one subroutine Join that needs to be implemented differently for each
balanced BST, and on top of which we can implement generic, simple and

work-efficiency of these Join-based set functions using a generic proof working
for all the four types of balanced BSTs.
  We also implemented and tested our algorithm on all the four balancing

three set functions perform similarly in time and speedup (more than 45x on 64
cores). We also compare the performance of our implementation to other existing

address the predicted growth in mobile traffic demand. Operators to enhance the
capacity of cellular networks are increasingly using WiFi to offload traffic
from their core networks. This paper deals with the efficient and flexible
management of a heterogeneous networking environment offering wireless access
to multimode terminals. This wireless access is evaluated under disruptive
usage scenarios, such as flash crowds, which can mean unwanted severe
congestion on a specific operator network whilst the remaining available
capacity from other access technologies is not being used. To address these
issues, we propose a scalable network assisted distributed solution that is
administered by centralized policies, and an embedded reputation system, by
which initially selfish operators are encouraged to cooperate under the threat
of churn. Our solution after detecting a congested technology, including within
its wired backhaul, automatically offloads and balances the flows amongst the
access resources from all the existing technologies, following some quality
metrics. Our results show that the smart integration of access networks can
yield an additional wireless quality for mobile flows up to thirty eight
percent beyond that feasible from the best effort standalone operation of each
wireless access technology. It is also evidenced that backhaul constraints are
conveniently reflected on the way the flow access to wireless media is granted.
Finally, we have analyzed the sensitivity of the handover decision algorithm
running in each terminal agent to consecutive flash crowds, as well as its
centralized feature that controls the connection quality offered by a
heterogeneous access infrastructure owned by distinct operators.

flows in the cooler Fe XIII line but strong upflows, up to 80-150 km/s, in the

co-temporal with the sharp intensity peak. The electron density obtained from a
Fe XIII line pair ratio exhibited fast increase (within two minutes) from the
pre-flare level of 5.01x10^(9) cm^(-3) to 3.16x10^(10) cm^(-3) during the flare

acceleration site to the lower atmospheric layers during the flare peak was
found to be 1.34x10^(10) erg/s/cm^(2) for a low-energy cut-off that was
estimated to be 16 keV. During the decline flare phase, we found a secondary
intensity and density peak of lower amplitude that was preceded by upflows of
15 km/s that were detected in both lines. The flare was also accompanied by a
filament eruption that was partly captured by the EIS observations. We derived
Doppler velocities of 250-300 km/s for the upflowing filament material.The
spectroscopic results for the flare peak are consistent with the scenario of
explosive chromospheric evaporation, although a comparatively low value of the
nonthermal energy flux density was determined for this phase of the flare. This
outcome is discussed in the context of recent hydrodynamic simulations. It
provides observational evidence that the response of the atmospheric plasma
strongly depends on the properties of the electron beams responsible for the

effective construction for producing keyed message digests using shared
secrets. HMACs have seen widespread use as ad-hoc digital signatures in many
Internet applications. While messages signed with an HMAC are secure against
sender impersonation and tampering in transit, if used alone they are
susceptible to replay attacks. We propose a construction that extends HMACs to
produce a keyed message digest that has a finite validity period. We then
propose a message signature scheme that uses this time-dependent MAC along with
an unique message identifier to calculate a set of authentication factors using
which a recipient can readily detect and ignore replayed messages, thus
providing perfect resistance against replay attacks. We further analyse
time-based message authentication codes and show that they provide stronger

cluster, dubbed Fornax Deep Survey (FDS), at the VLT Survey Telescope. In this
paper we present the deep photometry inside two square degrees around the
bright galaxy NGC1399 in the core of the cluster. We found a very extended and
diffuse envelope surrounding the luminous galaxy NGC1399: we map the surface
brightness out to 33 arcmin (~ 192 kpc) from the galaxy center and down to
about 31 mag/arcsec^2 in the g band. The deep photometry allows us to detect a
faint stellar bridge in the intracluster region between NGC1399 and NGC1387. By
analyzing the integrated colors of this feature, we argue that it could be due
to the ongoing interaction between the two galaxies, where the outer envelope
of NGC1387 on its east side is stripped away. By fitting the light profile, we
found that it exists a physical break radius in the total light distribution at
R=10 arcmin (~58 kpc) that sets the transition region between the bright
central galaxy and the outer exponential stellar halo. We discuss the main
implications of this work on the build-up of the stellar halo at the center of
the Fornax cluster. By comparing with the numerical simulations of the stellar
halo formation for the most massive BCGs, we find that the observed stellar
halo mass fraction is consistent with a halo formed through the multiple
accretion of progenitors with a stellar mass in the range 10^8 - 10^11 M_sun.
This might suggest that the halo of NGC1399 has also gone through a major
merging event. The absence of a significant number of luminous stellar streams
and tidal tails out to 192 kpc suggests that the epoch of this strong
interaction goes back to an early formation epoch. Therefore, differently from
the Virgo cluster, the extended stellar halo around NGC1399 is characterised by
a more diffuse and well-mixed component, including the ICL.

""Baryonic Tully-Fisher"" relation, BTF) has long confounded galaxy formation
models. It is steeper than the M ~ V^3 scaling relating halo virial masses and
circular velocities and its zero point implies that galaxies comprise a very
small fraction of available baryons. Such low galaxy formation efficiencies may
in principle be explained by winds driven by evolving stars, but the tightness
of the BTF relation argues against the substantial scatter expected from such
vigorous feedback mechanism. We use the APOSTLE/EAGLE simulations to show that
the BTF relation is well reproduced in LCDM simulations that match the size and
number of galaxies as a function of stellar mass. In such models, galaxy
rotation velocities are proportional to halo virial velocity and the steep
velocity-mass dependence results from the decline in galaxy formation
efficiency with decreasing halo mass needed to reconcile the CDM halo mass
function with the galaxy luminosity function. Despite the strong feedback, the
scatter in the simulated BTF is smaller than observed, even when considering
all simulated galaxies and not just rotationally-supported ones. The
simulations predict that the BTF should become increasingly steep at the faint
end, although the velocity scatter at fixed mass should remain small. Observed
galaxies with rotation speeds below ~40 km/s seem to deviate from this
prediction. We discuss observational biases and modeling uncertainties that may
help to explain this disagreement in the context of LCDM models of dwarf galaxy
formation.

electromagnetic response functions in strongly correlated fermionic

new theoretical formalism not contained in the current literature. Among
concrete examples are a rather extensive class of theoretical models which
incorporate BCS-BEC crossover as applied to the ultra cold Fermi gases, along
with theories specifically associated with the high-$T_c$ cuprates. The
challenge is to maintain gauge invariance, while simultaneously incorporating
additional self-energy terms arising from strong correlation effects. Central
to our approach is the application of the Ward-Takahashi identity, which
introduces collective mode contributions in the response functions and
guarantees that the $f$-sum rule is satisfied. We outline a powerful and very
general method to determine these collective modes in a manner compatible with
gauge invariance. Finally, as an alternative approach, we contrast with the
path integral formalism. Here, the calculation of gauge invariant response
appears more straightforward. However, the collective modes introduced are
essentially those of strict BCS theory, with no modification from correlation
effects. Since the path integral scheme simultaneously addresses
electrodynamics and thermodynamics, we emphasize that it should be subjected to
a consistency test beyond gauge invariance, namely that of the compressibility
sum-rule. We show how this sum-rule fails in the conventional path integral
approach.

evolution. At low redshift the cosmic SFR density declines smoothly, and
massive active galaxies become passive, reducing their star formation activity.
This implies that the bulk of the SFR density at low redshift is mainly driven
by low mass objects. We investigate the properties of a sample of low
luminosity Far-Infrared (FIR) sources selected at 250 microns from Pappalardo
et al. (2015). We have collected data from Ultraviolet to FIR to perform a
multi-wavelengths analysis. The main goal is to investigate the correlation
between SFR, stellar mass, and dust mass for a galaxy population with a wide
range in dust content and stellar mass, including the low mass regime that most
probably dominates the SFR density at low z. We define a main sample of ~800
sources with full Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) coverage between 0.15 <
lambda < 500 microns and an extended sample with ~5000 sources in which we
remove the constraints on the Ultraviolet and Near-Infrared bands. We analyze
both samples with two different SED fitting methods: MAGPHYS and CIGALE. In the
SFR versus stellar mass plane our samples occupy a region included between
local spirals and higher redshift star forming galaxies. The galaxies subsample
with the higher masses (M* > 3e10 Msol) does not lie on the main sequence, but
shows a small offset, as a consequence of the decreased star formation. Low
mass galaxies (M* < 1e10 Msol) settle in the main sequence with SFR and stellar
mass consistent with local spirals. Deep Herschel data allow the identification
of a mixed galaxy population, with galaxies still in an assembly phase, or
galaxies at the beginning of their passive evolution. We find that the dust
luminosity is the parameter that discriminates these two galaxy populations.

discrete chain of pointlike string bits. When the bit number $M$ is large, a
chain behaves as a continuous string. We study the simplest case that has only
one bosonic bit and one fermionic bit. The creation and annihilation operators
are adjoint representations of the $U\left(N\right)$ color group. We show that
the supersymmetry reduces the parameter number of a Hamiltonian from 7 to 3
and, at $N=\infty$, ensures a continuous energy spectrum, which implies the
emergence of one spatial dimension. The Hamiltonian $H_{0}$ is constructed so
that in the large $N$ limit it produces a world sheet spectrum with one
Grassmann world sheet field. We concentrate on numerical study of the model in
finite $N$. For the Hamiltonian $H_{0}$, we find that the would-be ground
energy states disappear at $N=\left(M-1\right)/2$ for odd $M\leq11$. Such a
simple pattern is spoiled if $H$ has an additional term $\xi\Delta H$ which
does not affect the result of $N=\infty$. The disappearance point moves to
higher (lower) $N$ when $\xi$ increases (decreases). Particularly, the
$\pm\left(H_{0}-\Delta H\right)$ cases suggest a possibility that the ground
state could survive at large $M$ and $M\gg N$. Our study reveals that the model
has stringy behavior: when $N$ is fixed and large enough, the ground energy
decreases linearly with respect to $M$, and the excitation energy is roughly of
order $M^{-1}$. We also verify that a stable system of Hamiltonian $\pm
H_{0}+\xi\Delta H$ requires $\xi\geq\mp1$.

scheme [Phys. Rev. B 89, 121105(R) (2014)]. Here we systematically examine the
accuracy and efficiency of the `interleaved' NRG (iNRG) method in the context
of the single impurity Anderson model, the two-channel Kondo model, and a
three-channel Anderson-Hund model. The performance of iNRG is explicitly
compared with `standard' NRG (sNRG): when the average number of states kept per
iteration is the same in both calculations, the accuracy of iNRG is equivalent
to that of sNRG but the computational costs are signifficantly lower in iNRG
when the same symmetries are exploited. Although iNRG weakly breaks SU(N)
channel symmetry (if present), both accuracy and numerical cost are entirely
competitive with sNRG exploiting full symmetries. iNRG is therefore shown to be
a viable and technically simple alternative to sNRG for high-symmetry models.
Moreover, iNRG can be used to solve a range of lower-symmetry multiband

is complicated by asynchronous returns, market mi- crostructure noise and
jumps. One technique for addressing both asynchronous returns and market
microstructure is the Kalman-EM (KEM) algorithm. However the KEM approach
assumes log-normal prices and does not address jumps in the return process
which can corrupt estimation of the covariance matrix.
  In this paper we extend the KEM algorithm to price models that include jumps.
We propose two sparse Kalman filtering approaches to this problem. In the first
approach we develop a Kalman Expectation Conditional Maximization (KECM)
algorithm to determine the un- known covariance as well as detecting the jumps.
For this algorithm we consider Laplace and the spike and slab jump models, both
of which promote sparse estimates of the jumps. In the second method we take a
Bayesian approach and use Gibbs sampling to sample from the posterior
distribution of the covariance matrix under the spike and slab jump model.
Numerical results using simulated data show that each of these approaches
provide for improved covariance estima- tion relative to the KEM method in a
variety of settings where jumps occur.

but unresolved problem. One of the most intriguing issues is whether or not the

the chiral symmetry. This may determine the universality class of the chiral
phase transition. Since the physics near the chiral phase transition is
essentially non-perturbative, we employ first principles lattice techniques to
address this issue. We use overlap fermions, which have exact chiral symmetry
on the lattice, to probe the anomalous U(1) symmetry violation of 2+1 flavor
dynamical QCD configurations with domain wall fermions. The latter also
optimally preserves chiral and flavor symmetries on the lattice, since it is
known that the remnant chiral symmetry of the light quarks influences the
scaling of the chiral condensate in the crossover transition region. We observe
that the anomalous U(1) is not effectively restored in the chiral crossover
region. We perform a systematic study of the finite size and cut-off effects
since the signals of U(1) violation are sensitive to it. We also provide a
glimpse of the microscopic topological structures of the QCD medium that are
responsible for the strongly interacting nature of the quark gluon plasma
phase. We study the effect of these microscopic constituents through our first
calculations for the topological susceptibility of QCD at finite temperature,

version of the data when the compressor is agnostic to the relation between the
signal and the data. This situation arises in a host of modern applications
when data is transmitted or stored prior to determining the downstream
inference task. Given a bitrate constraint and a distortion measure between the
data and its compressed version, let us consider the joint distribution
achieving Shannon's rate-distortion (RD) function. Given an estimator and a
loss function associated with the downstream inference task, define the
rate-distortion risk as the expected loss under the RD-achieving distribution.
We provide general conditions under which the operational risk in estimating
from the compressed data is asymptotically equivalent to the RD risk. The main
theoretical tools to prove this equivalence are transportation-cost
inequalities in conjunction with properties of compression codes achieving
Shannon's RD function. Whenever such equivalence holds, a recipe for designing
estimators from datasets undergoing lossy compression without specifying the
actual compression technique emerges: design the estimator to minimize the RD
risk. Our conditions simplified in the special cases of discrete memoryless or
multivariate normal data. For these scenarios, we derive explicit expressions
for the RD risk of several estimators and compare them to the optimal source
coding performance associated with full knowledge of the relation between the
latent signal and the data.

practical systems is effective only when the channel estimates at the users
have very high precision, a condition which is generally unattainable in
wireless environments. In this paper we show that substantial improvements are
possible when the state sequence is drawn from a discrete distribution, such as
a constrained input constellation, for which state decoding can be
approximately optimal. We consider the ""writing on dirty paper"" channel in
which the state sequence is multiplied by a fast fading process and derive
conditions on the fading and state distributions for which state decoding
closely approaches capacity. These conditions intuitively relate to the ability
of the receiver to correctly identify both the input and the state realization
despite of the uncertainty introduced by fading.

pre-cancellation can be attained in Gelfand-Pinsker channel with additive state

extension of Costa's model to the compound setting: M receivers each observe
the sum of the channel input, Gaussian noise and one of M Gaussian state
sequences and attempt to decode the same common message. The state sequences
are all non-causally known at the transmitter which attempts to simultaneously
pre-code its transmission against the channel state affecting each output. In
this correspondence we derive the capacity to within 2.25 bits-per-channel-use
of the carbon copying onto dirty paper channel in which the state sequences are
statistically equivalent, having the same variance and the same pairwise
correlation. For this channel capacity is approached by letting the channel
input be the superposition of two codewords: a base codeword, simultaneously
decoded at each user, and a top codeword which is pre-coded against the state
realization at each user for a portion 1/M of the time. The outer bound relies
on a recursive bounding in which incremental side information is provided at
each receiver. This result represents a significant first step toward
determining the capacity of the most general ""carbon copy onto dirty paper""

have any jointly Gaussian distribution.

In this

holographic dark energy (HDE). Two key parameters of this model are the
fractional density of cosmological constant $\Omega_{\Lambda0}$, and the
dimensionless HDE parameter $c$. Since these two parameters determine the
dynamical properties of DE and the destiny of universe, it is important to
study the impacts of different values of $\Omega_{\Lambda0}$ and $c$ on the
$\Lambda$HDE model. In this paper, we apply various DE diagnostic tools to
diagnose $\Lambda$HDE models with different values of $\Omega_{\Lambda0}$ and
$c$; these tools include statefinder hierarchy \{$S_3^{(1)}, S_4^{(1)}$\},
fractional growth parameter $\epsilon$, and composite null diagnostic (CND),
which is a combination of \{$S_3^{(1)}, S_4^{(1)}$\} and $\epsilon$. We find
that: (1) adopting different values of $\Omega_{\Lambda0}$ only has
quantitative impacts on the evolution of the $\Lambda$HDE model, while adopting
different $c$ has qualitative impacts; (2) compared with $S_3^{(1)}$,
$S_4^{(1)}$ can give larger differences among the cosmic evolutions of the
$\Lambda$HDE model associated with different $\Omega_{\Lambda0}$ or different
$c$; (3) compared with the case of using a single diagnostic, adopting a CND
pair has much stronger ability to diagnose the $\Lambda$HDE model.

exhibits striking light changes in both eclipse depths and light maxima.

the eclipsing pair is currently in a marginal contact stage with a mass ratio
of $q$=1.20, an orbital inclination of $i$=66.0 deg, a temperature difference
of $\Delta$ ($T_{1}$--$T_{2}$)=172 K, and a third light of $l_3$=75.9 \%. To

eclipse depth is primarily caused by changing amounts of contamination due to
the nearby star KIC9532228 between the {\it Kepler} Quarters and that the
variable O'Connell effect originates from the starspot activity on the less
massive primary component. Based on our light-curve timings, a period study of

orbit due to a fourth component in a wider orbit, instead of either mass
transfer or angular momentum loss.

the issue of evolving distribution of neurons in deep learning, we propose an
efficient adaptive dropout (named \textbf{evolutional dropout}) that computes
the sampling probabilities on-the-fly from a mini-batch of examples. Empirical
studies on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed dropouts
achieve not only much faster convergence and but also a smaller testing error
than the standard dropout. For example, on the CIFAR-100 data, the evolutional
dropout achieves relative improvements over 10\% on the prediction performance
and over 50\% on the convergence speed compared to the standard dropout.

mean-field dynamics of an optomechanical resonator in the large-scale-movement
regime is found and investigated. Under a weak pumping power, the mechanical
resonator damps to steady state with a nonlinear static response sensitively
modified by the quadratic coupling. When the driving powerincreases beyond the
static energy balance, the steady states lose their stabilities via Hopf
bifurcations and the resonator produces stable self-sustained
oscillation(limit-circle behavior) of discrete energies with step-like
amplitudes due to the parametric effect of the quadratic coupling, which can be
understood roughly by the power balance between gain and loss on the resonator.
A further increase of the pumping power can induce chaotic dynamic of the
resonator via a typical routine of period-doubling bifurcation but which can be
stabilized by the parametric effect through an inversion bifurcation process
back to limit-circle states. The bifurcation-to-inverse-bifurcation transitions
are numerically verified by the maximal Lyapunov exponents of the dynamics and
which indicate an efficient way to suppress the chaotic behavior of the
optomechanical resonator by the quadratic coupling. Furthermore, the parametric
effect of the quadratic coupling on the dynamic transitions of an
optomechanical resonator can be conveniently detected or traced by the output
power spectrum of the cavity field.

kinetic equations. It is superior for transition flow simulations, and has been
validated in the past years. However, compared to the well known discrete
ordinate method (DOM) which is a classical numerical method solving the kinetic
equations, the UGKS needs more computational resources. In this study, we
propose a simplification of the unified gas kinetic scheme. It allows almost
identical numerical cost as the DOM, but predicts numerical results as accurate
as the UGKS. Based on the observation that the equilibrium part of the UGKS
fluxes can be evaluated analytically, the equilibrium part in the UGKS flux is
not necessary to be discretized in velocity space. In the simplified scheme,
the numerical flux for the velocity distribution function and the numerical
flux for the macroscopic conservative quantities are evaluated separately. The
simplification is equivalent to a flux hybridization of the gas kinetic scheme
for the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations and conventional discrete ordinate method.
Several simplification strategies are tested, through which we can identify the
key ingredient of the Navier-Stokes asymptotic preserving property. Numerical
tests show that, as long as the collision effect is built into the macroscopic
numerical flux, the numerical scheme is Navier-Stokes asymptotic preserving,
regardless the accuracy of the microscopic numerical flux for the velocity
distribution function.

using SPICE compatible racetrack memory electrical model and commercial CMOS 28

as $R_{\rm H}=1/(\bar{n}_{\rm hole}e)$ while $R_{\rm H}$ approaches zero near
quarter filling, which reflects the curvature of the Fermi surface. These

Lemaitre and Hubble established the expansion of the Universe. It is strictly
based on the assumption of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric
describing a locally homogeneous and isotropic universe and that photons move
on null geodesics of the metric. Thus any violation of this assumption, within
general relativity or modified gravity, can yield a different mapping between

the proxies of magnetic activity for solar-type stars observed with Kepler
telescope. The first is named autocorrelation index $i_{AC}$, which describes
the degree of periodicity of the light curve, the second is the effective
fluctuation range of the light curve $R_{eff}$, which reflects the depth of
rotational modulation. The two measures are complementary and depict different
aspects of magnetic activities on solar-type stars. By using the two proxies
$i_{AC}$ and $R_{eff}$, we analyzed activity properties of two carefully
selected solar-type stars observed with Kepler (Kepler ID: 9766237 and
10864581), which have distinct rotational periods (14.7 vs. 6.0 days). We also
applied the two measures to the Sun for a comparative study. The result shows
that both the measures can reveal cyclic activity variations (referred to as

the Kepler star with the faster rotation rate, $i_{AC}$-cycle and
$R_{eff}$-cycle are in the same phase, while for the Sun (slower rotator), they
are in the opposite phase. By comparing the solar light curve with simultaneous

wavelengths from 625 to 1025 nm and bandwidths of 50 nm. Photometry with these
medium-bands traces the spectral energy distribution (SED) of a source, similar
to spectroscopy with resolution R $\sim$ 15. By conducting medium-band

dwarfs (the main contaminants in high redshift quasar selection) using the SED
camera for QUasars in EArly uNiverse (SQUEAN) on the 2.1-m telescope at the
McDonald Observatory, we show that these medium-band filters are superior to
multi-color broad-band color section in separating high redshift quasars from
brown dwarfs. In addition, we show that redshifts of high redshift quasars can
be determined to an accuracy of $\Delta{\rm z}/(1+{\rm z}) = 0.002$ -- $0.026$.
The selection technique can be extended to z $\sim$ 7, suggesting that the
medium-band observation can be powerful in identifying quasars even at the

companies are poorly regulated. For example, Airbnb, one of the most successful
examples of sharing economy platform, is often criticized by regulators and
policy makers. While, in theory, municipalities should regulate the emergence
of Airbnb through evidence-based policy making, in practice, they engage in a
false dichotomy: some municipalities allow the business without imposing any
regulation, while others ban it altogether. That is because there is no
evidence upon which to draft policies. Here we propose to gather evidence from
the Web. After crawling Airbnb data for the entire city of London, we find out
where and when Airbnb listings are offered and, by matching such listing
information with census and hotel data, we determine the socio-economic
conditions of the areas that actually benefit from the hospitality platform.
The reality is more nuanced than one would expect, and it has changed over the
years. Airbnb demand and offering have changed over time, and traditional
regulations have not been able to respond to those changes. That is why,
finally, we rely on our data analysis to envision regulations that are
responsive to real-time demands, contributing to the emerging idea of
""algorithmic regulation"".

In this paper, we discuss a novel application of TPM, surveying its utility in

for the BGK equation in Xiong et. al. (2015) [37], which is based on the
micro-macro formulation of the equation. The nodal discontinuous Galerkin (NDG)
method with Lagrangian basis functions for spatial discretization and globally
stiffly accurate implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta (RK) scheme as time
discretization are introduced with asymptotic preserving properties. However,
it is only necessary to solve the kinetic equation when the hydrodynamic
description breaks down. Motivated by the recent work in Filbet and Rey (2015)
[23], it is more naturally to construct a hierarchy scheme under the NDG-IMEX
framework without hybridization, as the formal analysis in [37] shows that when
$\epsilon$ is small, the NDG-IMEX scheme becomes a local discontinuous Galerkin
(LDG) scheme for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, and when
$\epsilon=0$ it is a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for the compressible
Euler equations. Moveover, we propose to combine the kinetic regime with the
hydrodynamic regime including both the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes
equations. Numerical experiments demonstrate very decent performance of the new
approach. In our numerics, all three regimes are clearly divided, leading to
great savings in terms of the computational cost.

coexist and use multiple radio access technologies (multi-RATs). The coexisting
coverage and network capacity in such a multi-RAT HetNet are hardly
investigated in prior works. To characterize the coexisting interactions in a
multi-RAT HetNet, in this paper we consider a HetNet consisting of K-tier APs
and two different RATs, RAT-L and RAT-U, are adopted in the HetNet. RAT-L is
adopted by the access points (APs) in the first K-1 tiers and APs in the Kth
tier only use RAT-U. Both noncrossing-RAT and crossing-RAT user association
scenarios are considered. In each scenario, the void probability and channel
access probability of the APs in each tier are first found and then the tight
lower bounds and their lowest limits on the proposed coexisting coverage and
network capacity are derived. We show that multi-RAT networks in general can
achieve higher link coverage and capacity by using opportunistic CSMA/CA that
avoids/alleviates severe interfering between all coexisting APs. Also,
crossing-RAT user association is shown to achieve much higher coexisting
coverage and network capacity than noncrossing-RAT user association. Finally,
numerical simulations for the LTE-U and WiFi networks coexisting in the HetNet
validate our findings.

characteristic of the base field. We show that any Betti sequence of an ideal
with linear resolution appears as the Betti sequence of the circuit ideal of
such a chordal clutter. Associated with any simplicial order is a sequence of
integers which we call the $\lambda$-sequence of the chordal clutter. All
possible $\lambda$-sequences are characterized. They are intimately related to
the Hilbert function of a suitable standard graded $K$-algebra attached to the
chordal clutter. By the $\lambda$-sequence of a chordal clutter we determine
other numerical invariants of the circuit ideal, such as the
$\textbf{h}$-vector and the Betti numbers.

a dataset constructed from the English Wikipedia. We extensively evaluate
different variants of neural net based artificial agents on WikiNav and observe
that the proposed goal-driven web navigation well reflects the advances in

Furthermore, we extend the WikiNav with question-answer pairs from Jeopardy!

outperforms the engined based approaches, demonstrating the capability of the

noisy observations of the entries, which in practice is typically formulated as
a weighted low-rank approximation problem and solved by non-convex optimization
heuristics such as alternating minimization. In this paper, we provide provable
recovery guarantee of weighted low-rank via a simple alternating minimization
algorithm. In particular, for a natural class of matrices and weights and
without any assumption on the noise, we bound the spectral norm of the
difference between the recovered matrix and the ground truth, by the spectral
norm of the weighted noise plus an additive error that decreases exponentially
with the number of rounds of alternating minimization, from either
initialization by SVD or, more importantly, random initialization. These
provide the first theoretical results for weighted low-rank via alternating
minimization with non-binary deterministic weights, significantly generalizing
those for matrix completion, the special case with binary weights, since our
assumptions are similar or weaker than those made in existing works.
Furthermore, this is achieved by a very simple algorithm that improves the
vanilla alternating minimization with a simple clipping step.
  The key technical challenge is that under non-binary deterministic weights,
na\""ive alternating steps will destroy the incoherence and spectral properties
of the intermediate solutions, which are needed for making progress towards the
ground truth. We show that the properties only need to hold in an average sense
and can be achieved by the clipping step.
  We further provide an alternating algorithm that uses a whitening step that
keeps the properties via SDP and Rademacher rounding and thus requires weaker
assumptions. This technique can potentially be applied in some other
applications and is of independent interest.

2D group-IV materials because of largest atomic mass, weakest interatomic
bonding, and enhanced ZA phonon scattering due to the breaking of an
out-of-plane symmetry selection rule. However, we show that although the
lattice thermal conductivity $\kappa$ for graphene, silicene and germanene
decreases monotonically with decreasing Debye temperature, unexpected higher
$\kappa$ is observed in stanene. By enforcing all the invariance conditions in
2D materials and including Ge $3d$ and Sn $4d$ electrons as valence electrons
for germanene and stanene respectively, the lattice dynamics in these materials
are accurately described. A large acoustic-optical gap and the bunching of the
acoustic phonon branches significantly reduce phonon scattering in stanene,
leading to higher thermal conductivity than germanene. The vibrational origin
of the acoustic-optical gap can be attributed to the buckled structure.
Interestingly, a buckled system has two competing influences on phonon
transport: the breaking of the symmetry selection rule leads to reduced thermal
conductivity, and the enlarging of the acoustic-optical gap results in enhanced
thermal conductivity. The size dependence of thermal conductivity is
investigated as well. In nanoribbons, the $\kappa$ of silicene, germanene and
stanene is much less sensitive to size effect due to their short intrinsic
phonon mean free paths. This work sheds light on the nature of phonon transport
in buckled 2D materials.

discrepancies may also be caused by a different reason: the external
classification itself. For this end we use scientific publication data which i)
exhibit a well defined modular structure and ii) hold an expert-made

with the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), taking as starting point abstracts
of articles. Through the time, abstracts have been evolving towards higher
complexity on used terminology, which makes necessary the use of sophisticated
statistical methods and answering questions including: how vocabulary is
evolving through the time? Which ones are most influential articles? And which
one are the articles that introduced new terms and vocabulary? To answer these,
we analyze a dataset composed by 506 abstracts and downloaded from 115
different journals and cover a 18 year-period.

  laddering methodology","laddering technique; personal values; business performance;
  analytical tools in Int. J. Intercultural Information Management (2015)",,"10.1504/IJIIM.2015.072543",,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Analytical tools in business management are understood as a combination of
information technologies and quantitative methods used to assist stakeholders
to make better decisions. The contemporary business environment is dramatically
changing by the massive accumulation of data. Now, as never before, the use of
analytical tools must be expanded to take advantage of this growing digital
universe. This article will apply the laddering technique to see how personal
values (or managerial functions) influence a companys adoption of analytical
tools. A set of ten in-depth interviews are conducted with CEOs, analytics
consultants, academics and businessmen in order to establish quantitative
relations among attributes, consequences and personal values. Two easy-to-read
outputs are provided to interpret our results. The most important links are
quantitatively associated through an implication matrix, and then visually
represented on a hierarchical value map. Guidelines for improving the use of
analytical tools are provided in the last section

  P2P Live Streaming",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Minimum Physical Hop (MPH) has been proposed as a peer selection algorithm
for decreasing inter-AS (Autonomous System) traffic volume in P2P live
streaming. In MPH, a newly joining peer selects a peer whose physical hop count
(i.e., the number of ASes traversed on the content delivery path) from it is
the minimum as its providing peer. However, MPH shows high inter-AS traffic
volume when the number of joining peers is large. In this paper, we propose
IMPH that tries to further decrease the inter-AS traffic volume by distributing
peers with one logical hop count (i.e., the number of peers or origin streaming
servers (OSSes) traversed on the content delivery path from an OSS to the peer)
to many ASes and encouraging the following peers to find their providing peers
within the same AS. Numerical examples show that IMPH achieves at the maximum
of 64% lower inter-AS traffic volume than MPH.
