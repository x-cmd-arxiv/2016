possible nonsupersymmetric AdS/CFT correspondence. We consider a version
formulated for complete, asymptotically Poincar\'e-Einstein Riemannian metrics
$(M,g)$ with bounded scalar curvature $R\ge -n(n-1)$. This version then asserts
that any such $(M,g)$ must have mass not less than the mass $m_0$ of a metric
$g_0$ induced on a time-symmetric slice of a certain AdS soliton spacetime. The
conjecture remains unproved, having so far resisted standard techniques. Little
is known other than that the conjecture is true for metrics which are
sufficiently small perturbations of $g_0$. We pose another test for the
conjecture. We assume its validity and attempt to prove as a corollary the
corresponding scalar curvature rigidity statement, that $g_0$ is the unique
asymptotically Poincar\'e-Einstein metric with mass $m=m_0$ obeying $R\ge
-n(n-1)$. Were a second such metric $g_1$ not isometric to $g_0$ to exist, it
then may well admit perturbations of lower mass, contradicting the assumed
validity of the conjecture. We find that the minimum mass metric must be static
Einstein, so the problem is reduced to that of static uniqueness. When $n=3$
the manifold is isometric to a time-symmetric slice of an AdS soliton
spacetime, unless it has a non-compact horizon. En route we study the mass
aspect, obtaining and generalizing known results. The mass aspect is (i)
related to the holographic energy density, (ii) a weighted invariant under
boundary conformal transformations when the bulk dimension is odd, and (iii)
zero for negative Einstein manifolds with Einstein conformal boundary.

performance of the resulting spatially-coupled CBs (SC-CBs). We introduce an
equivalent bipartite graph representation of CBs with identical
iteration-by-iteration finite-length and asymptotic performance. Based on this
equivalent representation, we then analyze the asymptotic performance of
single-layer CBs and SC-CBs under the MP decoding algorithm proposed by Lu et
al.. In particular, we derive the potential threshold of the uncoupled system
and show that it is equal to the area threshold. We also derive the Maxwell
decoder for CBs and prove that the potential threshold is an upper bound on the
Maxwell decoding threshold. We show that the area under the extended MP
extrinsic information transfer curve is equal to zero precisely at the area
threshold. This, combined with the analysis of the Maxwell decoder and
simulation results, leads us to the conjecture that the potential threshold is
equal to the Maxwell decoding threshold and hence a lower bound on the maximum
a posteriori decoding threshold. Interestingly, SC-CBs do not show the
well-known phenomenon of threshold saturation of the MP decoding threshold to
the potential threshold characteristic of spatially-coupled low-density
parity-check codes and other coupled systems. However, SC-CBs yield better MP
decoding thresholds than their uncoupled counterparts. Finally, we also
consider SC-CBs as a compressed sensing scheme and show that low undersampling

global channel estimates at each device from combining local feedback and
information exchanged through backhauls. The method adapts to arbitrary initial
information topologies and feedback noise statistics and can do that with a
combination of closed-form and convex approaches. Simulations for coordinated

An investor is modeled as a Gaussian fuzzy set (a fuzzy opinion) with the
center and standard deviation as inputs and the fuzzy set itself as output.
Investors are connected in the following fashion: the center input of an
investor is taken as the average of the neighbors' outputs, where two investors
are neighbors if their fuzzy opinions are close enough to each other, and the
standard deviation (uncertainty) input is taken with local, global or external
reference schemes to model different scenarios of how investors define
uncertainties. The centers and standard deviations of the fuzzy opinions are
the expected prices and their uncertainties, respectively, that are used as
inputs to the price dynamic equation. We prove that with the local reference
scheme the investors converge to different groups in finite time, while with
the global or external reference schemes all investors converge to a consensus
within finite time and the consensus may change with time in the external
reference case. We show how to model trend followers, contrarians and
manipulators within this mathematical framework and prove that the biggest
enemy of a manipulator is the other manipulators. We perform Monte Carlo
simulations to show how the model parameters influence the price dynamics, and

interval. Then, an analysis is carried out locally on a big data platform and
the gains of proactive caching at the base stations are investigated via
numerical simulations. It turns out that several gains are possible depending
on the level of available information and storage size. For instance, with 10%

proactive caching achieves 100% of request satisfaction and offloads 98% of the
backhaul when considering 16 base stations.

of pressure of p = 2.3 GPa causes a decrease of lambda(0) by less than 5 %,

the present data with those previously obtained for optimally doped system x =

be modelled as final coalgebras of suitable behavioural functors. These
functors have the challenging peculiarity to be circularly defined with their
own final coalgebra. Our main contribution is a general construction for
defining these functors, solving this circularity which is the essence of
higher-order behaviours. This characterisation is syntax agnostic. To achieve
this property, we shift from term passing to behaviour passing: in the former
higher-order is expressed by passing around syntactic objects (such as terms or
processes) as representations of behaviours whereas the former ditches the
syntactic encoding altogether and works directly with behaviours i.e. semantic
objects. From this perspective, the former can be seen as syntactic
higher-order whereas the later as semantic higher-order.

partial support set estimation with compressive measurements in a distributed
network. Multiple nodes in the network are assumed to observe sparse signals
which share a common but unknown support. While in the traditional compressive
sensing (CS) framework, the goal is to recover the complete sparse signal, in
sparse signal detection, complete signal recovery may not be necessary to make
a reliable detection decision. In particular, detection can be performed based
on partially or inaccurately estimated signals which requires less
computational burden than that is required for complete signal recovery. To
that end, we investigate the problem of sparse signal detection based on
partially estimated support set. First, we discuss how to determine the minimum
fraction of the support set to be known so that a desired detection performance
is achieved in a centralized setting. Second, we develop two distributed
algorithms for sparse signal detection when the raw compressed observations are
not available at the central fusion center. In these algorithms, the final
decision statistic is computed based on locally estimated partial support sets
via orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) at individual nodes. The proposed
distributed algorithms with less communication overhead are shown to provide
comparable performance (sometimes better) to the centralized approach when the
size of the estimated partial support set is very small.

processors, the number of rounds of communication, and the per-processor load
-- the number of bits each processor can send or can receive in a single round
-- that are required to compute $q$.
  When the data is free of skew, we obtain essentially tight upper and lower
bounds for one round algorithms and we show how the bounds degrade when there
is skew in the data. In the case of skewed data, we show how to improve the
algorithms when approximate degrees of the heavy-hitter elements are available,
obtaining essentially optimal algorithms for queries such as simple joins and
triangle join queries.
  For queries that we identify as tree-like, we also prove nearly matching
upper and lower bounds for multi-round algorithms for a natural class of
skew-free databases. One consequence of these latter lower bounds is that for
any $\varepsilon>0$, using $p$ processors to compute the connected components
of a graph, or to output the path, if any, between a specified pair of vertices
of a graph with $m$ edges and per-processor load that is
$O(m/p^{1-\varepsilon})$ requires $\Omega(\log p)$ rounds of communication.
  Our upper bounds are given by simple structured algorithms using MapReduce.
Our one-round lower bounds are proved in a very general model, which we call
the Massively Parallel Communication (MPC) model, that allows processors to
communicate arbitrary bits. Our multi-round lower bounds apply in a restricted
version of the MPC model in which processors in subsequent rounds after the

to communicate to other clouds to fulfill the demands and discover services
elsewhere. This scenario is called intercloud computing or cloud federation.
Intercloud computing still lacks standard architecture. Prior works discuss
some of the architectural blueprints, but none of them highlight the key issues
involved and their impact, so that a valid and reliable architecture could be
envisioned. In this paper, we discuss the importance of intercloud computing
and present in detail its architectural components. Intercloud computing also
involves some issues. We discuss key issues as well and present impact of
storage heterogeneity. We have evaluated some of the most noteworthy cloud
storage services, namely Dropbox, Amazon CloudDrive, GoogleDrive, Microsoft

Discussion on the results shows the acceptability level of these storage

investigate the topological properties of the phase of a one-dimensional Bose
field in the presence of both thermal and quantum fluctuations -- the latter
ones being tuned by the depth of an optical lattice applied along the ring. In
the regime of large filling of the lattice, quantum Monte Carlo simulations
give direct access to the full statistics of fluctuations of the Bose-field

winding-number (or topological-sector) fluctuations are driven by quantum phase
slips localized around a Josephson link between two lattice wells, and their {
susceptibility} is found to jump at the superfluid-Mott insulator transition.
At finite (but low) temperature, on the other hand, the winding number
fluctuations are driven by thermal activation of nearly uniform phase twists,
whose activation rate is governed by the superfluid fraction. A
quantum-to-thermal crossover in winding number fluctuations is therefore
exhibited by the system, and it is characterized by a conformational change in
the topologically non-trivial configurations, from localized to uniform phase
twists, which can be experimentally observed in ultracold Bose gases via
matter-wave interference.

the effect of a random polarizability term on the know example of a three level

deciding whether a given \CSTN or CHyTN is dynamically consistent is
\coNP-hard. Then, we offer a proof that deciding whether a given CHyTN is
dynamically consistent is \PSPACE-hard, provided that the input instances are
allowed to include both multi-head and multi-tail hyperarcs. In light of this,
we continue our study by focusing on CHyTNs that allow only multi-head or only
multi-tail hyperarcs, and we offer the first deterministic (pseudo)
singly-exponential time algorithm for the problem of checking the
dynamic-consistency of such CHyTNs, also producing a dynamic execution strategy
whenever the input CHyTN is dynamically consistent. Since \CSTN{s} are a
special case of CHyTNs, this provides as a byproduct the first
sound-and-complete (pseudo) singly-exponential time algorithm for checking
dynamic-consistency in CSTNs. The proposed algorithm is based on a novel
connection between CSTN{s}/CHyTN{s} and Mean Payoff Games. The presentation of
the connection between \CSTN{s}/CHyTNs and \MPG{s} is mediated by the \HTN
model. In order to analyze the algorithm, we introduce a refined notion of
dynamic-consistency, named $\epsilon$-dynamic-consistency, and present a sharp
lower bounding analysis on the critical value of the reaction time
$\hat{\varepsilon}$ where a \CSTN/CHyTN transits from being, to not being,

transfer filter-function framework for open-loop control, we provide an exact
representation of the controlled dynamics for arbitrary stationary non-Gaussian
classical and quantum noise statistics, with analytical expressions emerging
when all dephasing sources are Gaussian. This exact characterization is used to
establish two main results. First, we construct multi-qubit sequences that
ensure maximum high-order error suppression in both the time and frequency
domain and that can be exponentially more efficient than existing ones in terms
of total pulse number. Next, we show how long-time multi-qubit storage may be
achieved by meeting appropriate conditions for the emergence of a fidelity
plateau under sequence repetition, thereby generalizing recent results for
single-qubit memory under Gaussian dephasing. In both scenarios, the key step
is to endow multi-qubit sequences with a suitable displacement anti-symmetry
property, which is of independent interest for applications ranging from
environment-assisted entanglement generation to multi-qubit noise spectroscopy
protocols.

generalized synchrony alignment function, we show that a network's
synchronization properties can be systematically optimized. This framework also
allows us to study the properties of synchrony-optimized networks, and in
particular, investigate the role of directed network properties such as nodal
in- and out-degrees. For instance, we find that in optimally rewired networks
the heterogeneity of the in-degree distribution roughly matches the
heterogeneity of the natural frequency distribution, but no such relationship
emerges for out-degrees. We also observe that a network's synchronization
properties are promoted by a strong correlation between the nodal in-degrees
and the natural frequencies of oscillators, whereas the relationship between
the nodal out-degrees and the natural frequencies has comparatively little
effect. This result is supported by our theory, which indicates that
synchronization is promoted by a strong alignment of the natural frequencies

(0.9--2.5 $\mu$m) of 37 of these variables, many of them observed in a bright
state. The spectra confirm that 15/18 sources with eruptive light curves have
signatures of a high accretion rate, either showing EXor-like emission features
($\Delta$v=2 CO, Br$\gamma$) and/or FUor-like features ($\Delta$v=2 CO and
H$_{2}$O strongly in absorption). Similar features were seen in some long term
periodic YSOs and faders but not in dippers or short-term variables. The sample
includes some dusty Mira variables (typically distinguished by smooth Mira-like
light curves), 2 cataclysmic variables and a carbon star. In total we have
added 19 new objects to the broad class of eruptive variable YSOs with episodic
accretion. Eruptive variable YSOs in our sample that were observed at bright
states show higher accretion luminosities than the rest of the sample. Most of
the eruptive variables differ from the established FUor and EXor subclasses,
showing intermediate outburst durations and a mixture of their spectroscopic
characteristics. This is in line with a small number of other recent
discoveries. Since these previously atypical objects are now the majority
amongst embedded members of the class, we propose a new classification for them
as MNors. This term (pronounced emnor) follows V1647 Ori, the illuminating star
of McNeil's Nebula.

characteristics of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Arrays (HERA) antenna.
These simulations are part of a multi-faceted campaign to determine the
effectiveness of the dish's design for obtaining a detection of redshifted 21
cm emission from the epoch of reionization. Our simulations show the existence
of reflections between HERA's suspended feed and its parabolic dish reflector
that fall below -40 dB at 150 ns and, for reasonable impedance matches, have a
negligible impact on HERA's ability to constrain EoR parameters. It follows
that despite the reflections they introduce, dishes are effective for
increasing the sensitivity of EoR experiments at relatively low cost. We find
that electromagnetic resonances in the HERA feed's cylindrical skirt, which is
intended to reduce cross coupling and beam ellipticity, introduces significant
power at large delays ($-40$ dB at 200 ns) which can lead to some loss of
measurable Fourier modes and a modest reduction in sensitivity. Even in the
presence of this structure, we find that the spectral response of the antenna
is sufficiently smooth for delay filtering to contain foreground emission at
line-of-sight wave numbers below $k_\parallel \lesssim 0.2$ $h$Mpc$^{-1}$, in
the region where the current PAPER experiment operates. Incorporating these
results into a Fisher Matrix analysis, we find that the spectral structure
observed in our simulations has only a small effect on the tight constraints
HERA can achieve on parameters associated with the astrophysics of
reionization.

$^{56}$Ni mass and the photometric properties at maximum, and between the rise
time to bolometric maximum and the post-maximum decline rate. We confirm the
small scatter in ($V-R$) at 10d past $R$-band maximum. The quantity $V_{\rm m}
\equiv \sqrt{2E_{\rm kin}/M_{\rm e}}$ is comparable to the Doppler velocity
measured from HeI 5875\AA\ at maximum in SNe IIb/Ib, although some scatter
arises from the uncertain level of chemical mixing. The OI7772\AA\ line may be
used for SNe Ic, but the correspondence deteriorates with higher ejecta
mass/energy. We identify a temporal reversal of the Doppler velocity at maximum
absorption in the $\sim$1.05$\mu$m feature in all models. The reversal is due
to HeI alone and could serve as a test for the presence of helium in SNe Ic.
Because of variations in composition and ionisation, the ejecta opacity shows
substantial variations with both velocity and time. This is in part the origin
of the offset between our model light curves and the predictions from the
Arnett model.

inducing the Planck mass and a positive cosmological constant, all proportional
to the same scale $v$. All mass ratios are functions of the values of coupling
constants at that scale. Below this scale (at which the Big Bang may occur),
the model takes the usual form of Einstein-Hilbert gravity in de Sitter space
plus calculable corrections. We show that there exist regions of parameter
space in which the breaking results in a local minimum of the effective action,
and a {\bf positive} dilaton $(\hbox{mass})^2$ from two-loop corrections
associated with the conformal anomaly. Furthermore, unlike the singlet case we
considered previously, some minima lie within the basin of attraction of the
ultraviolet fixed point. Moreover, the asymptotic behavior of the coupling
constants also lie within the range of convergence of the Euclidean path
integral, so there is hope that there will be candidates for sensible vacua.
Although open questions remain concerning unitarity of all such renormalizable
models of gravity, it is not obvious that, in curved backgrounds such as those
considered here, unitarity is violated. In any case, any violation that may
remain will be suppressed by inverse powers of the reduced Planck mass.

close white dwarf (WD) companions (WD+dM; typical separations < 1 au). Our
previous analysis demonstrated that dMs with close WD companions are more
magnetically active than their field counterparts. One likely implication of
having a close binary companion is increased stellar rotation through
disk-disruption, tidal effects, and/or angular momentum exchange; increased
stellar rotation has long been associated with an increase in stellar activity.
Previous studies show a strong correlation between dMs that are magnetically
active (showing H{\alpha} in emission) and the frequency of stellar flare
rates. We examine the difference between the flare rates observed in close
WD+dM binary systems and field dMs. Our sample consists of a subset of 181
close WD+dM pairs from Morgan et al. (2012) observed in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey Stripe 82, where we obtain multi-epoch observations in the Sloan
ugriz-bands. We find an increase in the overall flaring fraction in the close
WD+dM pairs (0.09$\pm$0.03%) compared to the field dMs (0.0108$\pm$0.0007%;
Kowalski et al. 2009) and a lower flaring fraction for active WD+dMs
(0.05$\pm$0.03%) compared to active dMs (0.28$\pm$0.05%; Kowalski et al. 2009).
We discuss how our results constrain both the single and binary dM flare rates.
Our results also constrain dM multiplicity, our knowledge of the Galactic

differences between continuous and bursty star formation (SF). Our model
utilizes physically motivated analytic fits to 1D radiative transfer
simulations of HII regions around dark matter halos in a representative cosmic
volume. Constraining our simulations with observed and extrapolated UV
luminosity functions of high redshift galaxies, we find that for a fixed halo
mass, stellar populations forming in bursty models produce larger HII regions
which leave behind long-lived relic HII regions which are able to maintain
partial ionization in the intergalactic medium (IGM) in a manner similar to an
early X-ray background. The overall effect is a significant increase in the
optical depth of the IGM, $\tau_e$, and a milder increase of the redshift of
reionization. To produce $\tau_e =0.066$ observed by Planck and complete
reionization by redshift $z_{\rm re}\sim 6$, models with bursty SF require an
escape fraction $f_{\rm esc}\sim 2\%-10\%$ that is 2-10 times lower than
$f_{\rm esc}\sim 17\%$ found assuming continuous SF and is consistent with
upper limits on $f_{\rm esc}$ from observations at $z=0$ and $z\sim 1.3-6$. The
ionizing photon budget needed to reproduce the observed $\tau_e$ and $z_{\rm
re}$ depends on the period and duty cycle of the bursts of SF and the
temperature of the neutral IGM. These results suggest that the tension between
observed and predicted ionizing photon budget for reionization can be
alleviated if reionization is driven by short bursts of SF, perhaps relating to
the formation of Population~III stars and compact star clusters such as
proto-globular clusters.

excess in narrowband filters (NB) caused by an emission line. In most cases,
the width of such filters is broad compared to typical line widths, and the
throughput of the filters varies substantially within the bandpass. This leads
to substantial uncertainties in redshifts and fluxes that are derived from the
observations with one specific NB. In this work we demonstrate that the
uncertainty in measured line parameters can be sharply reduced by using
repeated observations of the same target field with filters that have slightly
different transmittance curves. Such data are routinely collected with some
large field imaging cameras that use multiple detectors and a separate filter
for each of the detectors. An example is the NB118 data from ESO's VISTA
InfraRed CAMera (VIRCAM). We carefully developed and characterized this method
to determine more accurate redshift and line flux estimates from the ratio of
apparent fluxes measured from observations in different narrowband filters and
several matching broadband filters. Then, we tested the obtainable quality of
parameter estimation both on simulated and actual observations for the example
of Ha in the VIRCAM NB118 filters combined with broadband data in Y, J, H. We
find that by using this method, the errors in the measured lines fluxes can be
reduced up to almost an order of magnitude and that an accuracy in wavelength
of better than 1nm can be achieved with the ~13nm wide NB118 filters.

exoplanet observations that will revolutionize our ability to characterize the
atmospheric structure, composition, and circulation of these worlds. These
improvements stem from significant investments in new missions and facilities,
such as JWST and the several planned ground-based extremely large telescopes.
However, while exoplanet science currently has a wide range of sophisticated
models that can be applied to the tide of forthcoming observations, the
trajectory for preparing these models for the upcoming observational challenges
is unclear. Thus, our ability to maximize the insights gained from the next
generation of observatories is not certain. In many cases, uncertainties in a
path towards model advancement stems from insufficiencies in the laboratory
data that serve as critical inputs to atmospheric physical and chemical tools.
We outline a number of areas where laboratory or ab initio investigations could
fill critical gaps in our ability to model exoplanet atmospheric opacities,
clouds, and chemistry. Specifically highlighted are needs for: (1) molecular
opacity linelists with parameters for a diversity of broadening gases, (2)
extended databases for collision-induced absorption and dimer opacities, (3)
high spectral resolution opacity data for relevant molecular species, (4)
laboratory studies of haze and condensate formation and optical properties, (5)
significantly expanded databases of chemical reaction rates, and (6)
measurements of gas photo-absorption cross sections at high temperatures. We
hope that by meeting these needs, we can make the next two decades of exoplanet
science as productive and insightful as the previous two decades. (abr)

as redshift space distortions. For both BOSS data and mock catalogs, we use the
ZOBOV algorithm to identify voids, we stack together all voids with effective
radii of 30-100Mpc/h in the redshift range 0.43-0.7, and we accurately measure
the shape of the stacked voids. Our tests with the mock catalogs show that we
measure the stacked void ellipticity with a statistical precision of 2.6%. We
find that the stacked voids in redshift space are slightly squashed along the
line of sight, which is consistent with previous studies. We repeat this
measurement of stacked void shape in the BOSS data assuming several values of
Omega_m within the flat LCDM model, and we compare to the mock catalogs in
redshift space in order to perform the AP test. We obtain a constraint of
$\Omega_m = 0.38^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$ at the 68% confidence level from the AP test.
We discuss the various sources of statistical and systematic noise that affect
the constraining power of this method. In particular, we find that the measured
ellipticity of stacked voids scales more weakly with cosmology than the
standard AP prediction, leading to significantly weaker constraints. We discuss
how AP constraints will improve in future surveys with larger volumes and

induced interaction potential using an interferometric technique with single
atom sensitivity. We use this approach to implement a two-dimensional synthetic
spin lattice and demonstrate its versatility by tuning the range and anisotropy
of the effective spin interactions. Our measurements are in remarkable
agreement with exact solutions of the many-body dynamics, providing further
evidence for the high degree of accurate interaction control in these systems.
Finally, we identify a collective many-body decay process, and discuss possible
routes to overcome this current limitation of coherence times. Our work marks
the first step towards the use of laser-controlled Rydberg interactions for the
study of exotic quantum magnets in optical lattices.

when the accretion disk is tilted with respect to the orbital plane. Slow
retrograde precession of the line-of-nodes results in a signal---the negative
superhump---with a period slightly less than the orbital period. Previous
studies have shown that tilted disks exhibit negative superhumps, but a
consensus on how a disk initially tilts has not been reached. Analytical work
by Lai suggests that a magnetic field on the primary can lead to a tilt
instability in a disk when the dipole moment is offset in angle from the spin
axis of the primary and when the primary's spin axis is, itself, not aligned
with the angular momentum axis of the binary orbit. However, Lai did not apply
his work to the formation of negative superhumps. In this paper, we add Lai's
model to an existing smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. Using this code, we
demonstrate the emergence of negative superhumps in the ""light curve"" for a
range of magnetic dipole moments. We show that the period deficits calculated
from these negative superhumps match those in simulations using manually tilted
disks. When positive superhumps appear ($q \lesssim 0.33$), we show that the
period excesses calculated from these signals are also consistent with previous
results. Using examples, we show that the disks are tilted, though the tilt
varies periodically, and that they precess in the retrograde direction. The
magnetic fields found to lead to the emergence of negative superhumps lie in
the kilogauss regime.

substan- tially more reproducible and robust quantifications, increasing the
correlation of estimates from replicate data sets by up to 10% on genes with
low or moderate expression levels (bot- tom third of all genes). Furthermore,
DICEseq permits to quantify the trade-off between temporal sampling of RNA and
depth of sequencing, frequently an important choice when planning experiments.

4.5 um in the second epoch which suggests that the underlying cause or causes
of this variability change on the timescales of months. The second-epoch [3.6]

second derivative coupling term in the adiabatic representation, and it can
have an arbitrary large magnitude when a gap between neighbouring
Born-Oppenheimer (BO) potential energy surfaces (PESs) is closing.
Nevertheless, DBOC is typically neglected in mixed quantum-classical methods of
simulating nonadiabatic dynamics (e.g., fewest-switch surface hopping (FSSH)
method). A straightforward addition of DBOC to BO PESs in the FSSH method,
FSSH+D, has been shown to lead to numerically much inferior results for models
containing conical intersections. More sophisticated variation of the DBOC
inclusion, phase-space surface-hopping (PSSH) was more successful than FSSH+D
but on model problems without conical intersections. This work comprehensively
assesses the role of DBOC in nonadiabatic dynamics of two electronic state
problems and the performance of FSSH, FSSH+D, and PSSH methods in variety of
one- and two-dimensional models. Our results show that the inclusion of DBOC
can enhance the accuracy of surface hopping simulations when two conditions are
simultaneously satisfied: 1) nuclei have kinetic energy lower than DBOC and 2)
PESs are not strongly nonadiabatically coupled. The inclusion of DBOC is
detrimental in situations where its energy scale becomes very high or even
diverges, because in these regions PESs are also very strongly coupled. In this
case, the true quantum formalism heavily relies on an interplay between
diagonal and off-diagonal nonadiabatic couplings while surface hopping
approaches treat diagonal terms as PESs and off-diagonal ones stochastically.

measures the first step in the interaction of a particle with a surface, is
usually assumed in simulations of ISM environments to be either 0.5 or 1. Here
we report on the determination of the sticking coefficient of H$_2$, D$_2$,

standard way of measuring the sticking coefficient --- the King-Wells method
--- leads to the underestimation of trapping events in which there is
incomplete energy accommodation of the molecule on the surface. Surface
scattering experiments with the use of a pulsed molecular beam are used instead
to measure the sticking coefficient. Based on the values of the measured
sticking coefficient we suggest a useful general formula of the sticking

the effect of sticking on the abundance of key molecules both on grains and in

Changing the chirp rate affects the transition to the lower state through the
conical intersection. It also affects the interference of different pathways in
the upper electronic state, due to the geometric phase acquired. Increasing the
chirp rate decreases the coherence of the wave packet in the upper electronic
state. This suggests that there is a finite momentum dependent lifetime of the
wave packet through the level-crossing as function of chirp. We dub this
lifetime the wave packet momentum lifetime.

unique capability is likely the result of the spatiotemporal arrangement of

that the axon membrane skeleton is structured as a series of actin rings
connected by spectrin filaments that are held under entropic tension. Sodium
channels also exhibit a periodic distribution pattern, as they bind to ankyrin
G, which associates with spectrin. Here, we elucidate the relationship between
the axon membrane skeleton structure and the function of the axon. By combining
cytoskeletal dynamics and continuum diffusion modeling, we show that spectrin

large systematic velocity gradients, perpendicular to the jet axis, in the
blueshifted and redshifted bullets. After discussing several alternative

the measured rotation velocities are 11.7-13.7 km/s for the blueshifted bullet

momenta of the two bullets are comparable to those of dense cores, about 10
times larger than those of protostellar envelopes, and about 20 times larger
than those of circumstellar disks. If the velocity gradients are due to the
rotation of the SVS13A jet, the significant amount of specific angular momenta
of the bullets indicates that the rotation of jets/outflows is a key mechanism
to resolve the so-called 'angular momentum problem' in the field of star
formation. The kinematics of the bullets suggests that the jet launching
footprint on the disk has a radius of about 7.2-7.7 au, which appears to
support the extended disk-wind model. We note that further observations are
needed to comprehensively understand the kinematics of the SVS13A jet, in order

and long-range interactions were studied through the free energy density
obtained by analytical methods. The competition emerges when positive
short-range interactions of strength $K$ arranged in a linear chain tend to
establish an anti-parallel spin order, whereas negative long-range interactions
$-J$ tend to align them in parallel. Thus, no ferromagnetic order exists for
$K/J > 0.25$. So, the phase-diagrams were scanned by varying the values of $K$
in this interval. As in other similar study done for the spin-1 case, the
second-order frontier separating the ferromagnetic and the paramagnetic phases
is transformed gradually into a first-order line, when $K/J$ is greater than a
certain critical value. Accordingly, there is a subinterval of $K$, for which
two tricritical points appear restricting the length of the second-order
frontier. Nevertheless, for greater values of $K/J$, the
ferromagnetic-paramagnetic frontier becomes wholly of first order. Also, the
tipical coexistence line, which divides two different ferromagnetic phases of
magnetization $m=3/2$ and $m=1/2$, becomes more complex by giving rise to
another line of coexistence with a reentrant behavior that encloses a third
ordered phase. In this case, the competition is such that there is a region in
the phase diagram, where for each spin $i$ with $S_{i}=3/2$ ($S_{i}=-3/2$),
there is another one spin $j$ with $S_{j}=-1/2$ ($S_{j}=1/2$), so the absolute

splitting-based interference channel (IFC) with simultaneous wireless
information and power transfer (SWIPT). The considered IFC consists of multiple
source-destination pairs. Each destination splits its received signal into two
parts for information decoding and energy harvesting (EH), respectively. Each
pair adjusts its transmit power and power splitting ratio to meet both the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and EH constraints at its
corresponding destination. To characterize rational behaviors of
source-destination pairs, we formulate a non-cooperative game for the
considered system, where each pair is modeled as a strategic player who aims to
minimize its own transmit power under both SINR and EH constraints at the
destination. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence
and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the formulated game. The best
response strategy of each player is derived and then the NE can be achieved
iteratively. Numerical results show that the proposed game-theoretic approach
can achieve a near-optimal performance under various SINR and EH constraints.

estimation in a variety of contexts, such as observational studies, marginal
structural models and interference. They enjoy appealing theoretical properties
such as consistency and possible efficiency under correct model specification.
However, this theoretical appeal may be diminished in practice by sensitivity
to misspecification of the propensity score model. To improve on this, we
borrow an idea from an alternative approach to causal effect estimation in
observational studies, namely subclassification estimators. It is well known
that compared to weighting estimators, subclassification methods are usually
more robust to model misspecification. In this paper, we first discuss an
intrinsic connection between the seemingly unrelated weighting and
subclassification estimators, and then use this connection to construct robust
propensity score weights via subclassification. We illustrate this idea by
proposing so-called full-classification weights and accompanying estimators for
causal effect estimation in observational studies. Our novel estimators are
both consistent and robust to model misspecification, thereby combining the
strengths of traditional weighting and subclassification estimators for causal
effect estimation from observational studies. Numerical studies show that the
proposed estimators perform favorably compared to existing methods.

approach each other and reconnect continually. The connectivity of the loops is
changed and new loops are formed and stack together. The stacked loops are
sharply bent, implying that they are greatly impacted by the magnetic tension
force. When another more reconnection process takes place, one new loop is
formed and stacks with the previously formed ones. Meanwhile, the stacked loops
retract suddenly and move toward the balance position, performing an overshoot
movement, which led to an oscillation with an average period of about 45 s. The
oscillation of newly formed loops after magnetic reconnection in the
chromosphere is observed for the first time. We suggest that the stability of
the stacked loops is destroyed due to the join of the last new loop and then
suddenly retract under the effect of magnetic tension. Because of the
retraction, another lower loop is pushed outward and performs an oscillation
with the period of about 25 s. The different oscillation periods may be due to
their difference in three parameters, i.e., loop length, plasma density, and
magnetic field strength.

(UV) radiation by ozone, leading to a modification of the temperature and wind
structures and consequently to the surface through changes in wave propagation
and circulation. While changes in total, spectrally-integrated, solar
irradiance lead to small variations in global mean surface temperature, the
`top-down' UV effect preferentially influences on regional scales at
mid-to-high latitudes with, in particular, a solar signal noted in the North
Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The amplitude of the UV variability is fundamental
in determining the magnitude of the climate response but understanding of the
UV variations has been challenged recently by measurements from the SOlar
Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite, which show UV solar cycle
changes up to 10 times larger than previously thought. Indeed, climate models
using these larger UV variations show a much greater response, similar to NAO
observations. Here we present estimates of the ozone solar cycle response using
a chemistry-climate model (CCM) in which the effects of transport are
constrained by observations. Thus the photolytic response to different spectral
solar irradiance (SSI) datasets can be isolated. Comparison of the results with
the solar signal in ozone extracted from observational datasets yields
significantly discriminable responses. According to our evaluation the SORCE UV
dataset is not consistent with the observed ozone response whereas the smaller

a notion of restricted $q$-isometry property ($q$-RIP) adapted to a dictionary,
which is a natural extension of the standard $q$-RIP, and establish a
generalized $q$-RIP condition for approximate reconstruction of signals via the
$l_q$-analysis optimization. We then determine how many random, Gaussian

resulting sufficient condition is met by fewer measurements for smaller $q$

  The introduced generalized $q$-RIP is also useful in compressed data
separation. In compressed data separation, one considers the problem of
reconstruction of signals' distinct subcomponents, which are (approximately)
sparse in morphologically different dictionaries, from few measurements. With
the notion of generalized $q$-RIP, we show that under an usual assumption that
the dictionaries satisfy a mutual coherence condition, the $l_q$ split analysis

the approximability of Directed Steiner Tree and that r-MTC can be solved in
polynomial time if the underlying graph has bounded treewidth. We also show
that the best approximation ratio for MTC is at least $O(2^{\log^{1-\epsilon}

individual discussions to a range of isomorphic problems. We examine potential
factors that may help or hinder transfer of problem-solving skills from one
problem in a pair to the other. For some paired isomorphic problems, one
context often turned out to be easier for students in that it was more often
correctly solved than the other. When quantitative and conceptual questions
were paired and given back to back, students who answered both questions in the
IPP often performed better on the conceptual questions than those who answered
the corresponding conceptual questions only. Although students often took
advantage of the quantitative counterpart to answer a conceptual question of an
IPP correctly, when only given the conceptual question, students seldom tried
to convert it into a quantitative question, solve it and then reason about the
solution conceptually. Misconceptions associated with friction in some problems
were so robust that pairing them with isomorphic problems not involving
friction did not help students discern their underlying similarities.
Alternatively, from the knowledge in pieces perspective, the activation of the
knowledge resource related to friction was so strongly and automatically
triggered by the context, which is outside the conscious control of the
student, that students did not look for analogies with paired problems or other
aids that may be present.

regular languages. It will show how to expand Jaccard distance, which works on
finite sets, to potentially-infinite regular languages. The entropy of a
regular language plays a large role in the extension. Much of the paper is
spent investigating the entropy of a regular language. This includes addressing
issues that have required previous authors to rely on the upper limit of
Shannon's traditional formulation of entropy, because its limit does not always
exist. The paper also includes proposing a new limit based formulation for the
entropy of a regular language and proves that formulation to both exist and be
equivalent to Shannon's original formulation (when it exists). Additionally,
the proposed formulation is shown to equal an analogous but formally quite
different notion of topological entropy from Symbolic Dynamics -- consequently
also showing Shannon's original formulation to be equivalent to topological
entropy. Surprisingly, the natural Jaccard-like entropy distance is trivial in
most cases. Instead, the {\it entropy sum} distance metric is suggested, and
shown to be granular in certain situations.

reflection with peers about problem solving. The recitations for an
introductory physics course with 200 students were broken into the ""Peer
Reflection"" (PR) group and the traditional group. Each week in recitation,
students in the PR group reflected in small teams on selected problems from the
homework. The graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants (TAs) in the PR
group recitations provided guidance and coaching to help students learn
effective problem solving heuristics. In the recitations for the traditional
group, students had the opportunity to ask the graduate TA questions about the
homework before they took a weekly quiz. On the final exam with only
multiple-choice questions, the PR group drew diagrams on more problems than the
traditional group, even when there was no external reward for doing so. Since
there was no partial credit for drawing the diagrams on the scratch books,
students did not draw diagrams simply to get credit for the effort shown and
must value the use of diagrams for solving problems if they drew them. We also
find that, regardless of whether the students belonged to the traditional or PR
groups, those who drew more diagrams for the multiple-choice questions
outperformed those who did not draw them.

students already know. Here, we discuss the response of graduate students
enrolled in a TA training course to categorization tasks in which they were
asked to group problems based upon similarity of solution first from their own
perspective, and later from the perspective of introductory physics students.
Many graduate students performed an expert-like categorization of introductory
physics problems. However, when asked to categorize the same problems from the
perspective of introductory students, many graduate students expressed dismay,
claiming that the task was impossible, pointless and had no relevance to their
TA duties. We will discuss how categorization can be a useful tool for
scaffolding and improving pedagogical content knowledge of teaching assistants
and instructors.
