the disappearance of the stretch-induced wrinkled pattern of thin, clamped,
elastic sheets by numerical simulation of the F\""oppl-von K\'arm\'an equations
extended to the finite in-plane strain regime. It has also been revealed that
for some aspect ratios of the rectangular domain wrinkles do not occur at all
regardless of the applied extension. To verify these predictions we carried out
experiments on thin 20 micrometer thick adhesive covered), previously
prestressed elastomer sheets with different aspect ratios under displacement
controlled pull tests. On one hand the the adjustment of the material
properties during prestressing is highly advantageous as in targeted strain
regime the film becomes substantially linearly elastic (which is far not the
case without prestress). On the other hand a significant, non-ignorable
orthotropy develops during this first extension. To enable quantitative
comparisons we abandoned the assumption about material isotropy inherent in the
original model and derived the governing equations for an orthotropic medium.
In this way we found good agreement between numerical simulations and
experimental data.
  Analysis of the negativity of the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor
revealed that the critical stretch for a bifurcation point at which the
wrinkles disappear must be finite for any aspect ratio. On the contrary there
is no such a bound for the aspect ratio as a bifurcation parameter. Physically
this manifests as complicated wrinkled patterns with more than one highly
wrinkled zones on the surface in case of elongated rectangles. These
arrangements have been found both numerically and experimentally. These
findings also support the new, finite strain model, since the F\""oppl-von
K\'arm\'an equations based on infinitesimal strains do not exhibit such a
behavior.

fiberization map, which allows us to solve an approximation problem for SI
spaces in the context of locally compact abelian groups. On the other hand, we
introduce the notion of decomposable MI spaces (MI spaces that can be
decomposed into an orthogonal sum of MI subspaces) and solve the approximation
problem for the class of these spaces. Since SI spaces having extra invariance
are in one-to-one relation to decomposable MI spaces, we also solve our
approximation problem for this class of SI spaces. Finally we prove that
translation invariant spaces are in correspondence with totally decomposable MI

The algorithm presented here uses a mixture of theoretical bounds (tight enough
to have practical implications as a screening or bounding procedure),
computational reuse, and highly tuned language libraries to achieve
computational efficiency. Currently, for many practical problems, this method
achieves better accuracy and sparsity than decision trees; further, in many

solvers based on conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) on large industrial

industrial benchmarks have been empirically found to have good community
structure, and experiments seem to show a correlation between such structure
and the efficiency of CDCL. However, in this paper we establish hardness
results suggesting that community structure is not sufficient to explain the
success of CDCL in practice. First, we formally characterize a property shared
by a wide class of metrics capturing community structure, including
""modularity"". Next, we show that the SAT instances with good community
structure according to any metric with this property are still NP-hard.
Finally, we study a class of random instances generated from the
""pseudo-industrial"" community attachment model of Gir\'aldez-Cru and Levy. We
prove that, with high probability, instances from this model that have
relatively few communities but are still highly modular require exponentially
long resolution proofs and so are hard for CDCL. We also present experimental
evidence that our result continues to hold for instances with many more
communities. This indicates that actual industrial instances easily solved by
CDCL may have some other relevant structure not captured by the community
attachment model.

be formed based on the temperature and chemical potential gradients between two
different reservoirs. A rectangular-type energy filter with width $\Gamma$ is
introduced for each engine to weaken the coupling between the particle and heat
fluxes. The efficiency at maximum power of each particle system decreases
monotonously from an upper bound $\eta^+$ to a lower bound $\eta^-$ when
$\Gamma$ increases from 0 to $\infty$. It is found that the $\eta^+$ values for
all three systems are bounded by $\eta_{\mathrm{C}}/2 \leq \eta^+ \leq
\eta_{\mathrm{C}}/(2-\eta_{\mathrm{C}})$ due to strong coupling, where
$\eta_{\mathrm{C}}$ is the Carnot efficiency. For the Bose-Einstein system, it
is found that the upper bound is approximated by the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency:
$\eta_{\mathrm{CA}}=1-\sqrt{1-\eta _{\mathrm{C}}}$. When
$\Gamma\rightarrow\infty$, the intrinsic maximum powers are proportional to the
square of the temperature difference of two reservoirs for all three systems,
and the corresponding lower bounds of efficiency at maximum power can be
simplified in the same form of

microscopy or inertial sensing \cite{RMPforce2003, Rugar2004, YazdiIEEE}. These

mechanical oscillators under applied force. Examples for such mechanical
oscillators include micro-fabricated cantilevers \cite{YazdiIEEE}, carbon
nanotubes \cite{NanotubeForce} as well as single trapped ions \cite{Bollinger,
Udem} . The best sensitivity is typically achieved when the force is
alternating at the mechanical resonance frequency of the oscillator thus
increasing its response by the mechanical quality factor. The measurement of
low-frequency forces, that are below resonance, is a more difficult task as the
resulting oscillation amplitudes are significantly lower. Here we use a single
trapped $^{88}Sr^{+}$ ion as a force sensor. The ion is trapped in a linear
harmonic trap, and is electrically driven at a frequency much lower than the
trap resonance frequency. To be able to measure the small amplitude of motion
we combine two powerful techniques. The force magnitude is determined by the
measured periodic Doppler shift of an atomic optical clock transition and the
Quantum Lock-in technique is used to coherently accumulate the phases acquired
during different force half-cycles. We demonstrate force detection both when
the oscillating force is phase-synchronized with the quantum lock-in sequence
and when it is asynchronous and report frequency force detection sensitivity as
low as $5.3\times10^{-19}\frac{\mathrm{N}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}}$ .

rotating about a common axis at slightly different rates (small Ekman number E)
has a long and celebrated history. The problem is relevant to the dynamics of
geophysical and planetary core flows, for which, in the case of electrically
conducting fluids, the possible operation of a dynamo is of considerable
interest. A comprehensive asymptotic study, in the limit E<<1, was undertaken
by Stewartson (J. Fluid Mech. 1966, vol. 26, pp. 131-144). The mainstream flow,
exterior to the E^{1/2} Ekman layers on the inner/outer boundaries and the
shear layer on the inner sphere tangent cylinder C, is geostrophic. Stewartson
identified a complicated nested layer structure on C, which comprises
relatively thick quasi-geostrophic E^{2/7} (inside C) and E^{1/4} (outside C)
layers. They embed a thinner E^{1/3} ageostrophic shear layer (on C), which
merges with the inner sphere Ekman layer to form the E^{2/5} Equatorial Ekman
layer of axial length E^{1/5}. Under appropriate scaling, this $E^{2/5}$--layer
problem may be formulated, correct to leading order, independent of E.
Accordingly, the Ekman boundary layer and ageostrophic shear layer become
features of the far-field (as identified by the large value of the scaled axial
co-ordinate z) solution. We present a numerical solution, which uses a
non-local integral boundary condition at finite $z$ to account for the
far-field behaviour. Adopting z^{-1} as a small parameter we extend
Stewartson's similarity solution for the ageostrophic shear layer to higher
orders. This far-field solution agrees well with that obtained from our
numerical model.

property of the coefficient matrix involved in the $N$-phase models based on
the pairwise surface tensions is established. Moreover, the symmetric
positive-definite property of the coefficient matrix on an $(N-1)$-dimensional
hyperplane --- which is of fundamental importance to the well-posedness of the
models --- can be proved equivalent to some physical condition for pairwise
surface tensions. The $N$-phase Allen-Cahn and $N$-phase Cahn-Hilliard
equations can then be derived from the free-energy functional. A natural
property is that the resulting dynamics of concentrations are independent of
phase variables chosen. Finite element discretizations for $N$-phase models can
be obtained as a natural extension of the existing discretizations for the
two-phase model. The discrete energy law of the numerical schemes can be proved
and numerically observed under some restrictions pertaining to time step size.
Numerical experiments including the spinodal decomposition and the evolution of

either stiff or smooth dynamics. Two closely-related examples, Nos\'e's 1984

these dynamics are consistent with Gibbs' canonical ensemble. Nos\'e's dynamics
is ""stiff"" and can present severe numerical difficulties. Nos\'e-Hoover
dynamics, though it follows exactly the same trajectory, is ""smooth"" and
relatively trouble-free. Our tutorial emphasises the power of adaptive
integrators to resolve stiff problems like the Nos\'e oscillator. The solutions
obtained illustrate the power of computer graphics to enrich numerical
solutions. Adaptive integration with computer graphics are basic to an
understanding of dynamical systems and statistical mechanics. These tools lead
naturally into the visualization of intricate fractal structures formed by

much has been written about structured programming, an important issue has been
left unanswered: given an arbitrary, compiled program, describe an algorithm to
decide whether or not it is structured, that is, whether it conforms to the
stated principles of structured programming. We refer to the classical concept
of structured programming, as described by Dijkstra. By employing a graph model
and graph-theoretic techniques, we formulate an efficient algorithm for
answering this question. To do so, we first introduce the class of graphs which
correspond to structured programs, which we call Dijkstra Graphs. Our problem
then becomes the recognition of such graphs, for which we present a greedy
$O(n)$-time algorithm. Furthermore, we describe an isomorphism algorithm for
Dijkstra graphs, whose complexity is also linear in the number of vertices of
the graph. Both the recognition and isomorphism algorithms have potential
important applications, such as in code similarity analysis.

shapes of some impenetrable or penetrable scatterers from a certain admissible

for the gesture recognition/detection. It then collects the scattered wave in a
relatively small backscattering aperture on a bounded surface containing the
point sources. The recognition algorithm consists of two steps and requires
only two incident waves of different wavenumbers. The approximate location of
the scatterer is first determined by using the measured data at a small
wavenumber and the shape of the scatterer is then identified using the computed
location of the scatterer and the measured data at a regular wavenumber. We
provide the mathematical principle with rigorous justifications underlying the
design. Numerical experiments show that the proposed device works effectively

brane in the massive gravity. Using the first law and the scaling argument, we
obtain two Smarr formulas. We show that both of them can be retrieved without

is assigned with one information beamformer and several shaping beamformers. It
is shown that the proposed REEL-BF scheme can perform general rank-$K$
beamforming for user symbols in a low-complexity and structured manner. In
addition, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee that the REEL-BF
scheme always achieves the SDP bound for linear beamforming schemes. Based on
such conditions, an efficient algorithm is then developed to obtain the optimal
REEL-BF solution in polynomial time. Numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed scheme enjoys substantial performance gains over the existing
alternatives.

approach in solving the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) system. Many of existing methods
are based on dimensional splitting, which decouples the problem into solving
linear advection problems, see {\em Cheng and Knorr, Journal of Computational
Physics, 22(1976)}. However, such splitting is subject to the splitting error.
If we consider multi-dimensional problems without splitting, difficulty arises
in tracing characteristics with high order accuracy. Specifically, the
evolution of characteristics is subject to the electric field which is
determined globally from the distribution of particle densities via the
Poisson's equation. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy of tracing
characteristics high order in time via a two-stage multi-derivative
prediction-correction approach and by using moment equations of the VP system.
With the foot of characteristics being accurately located, we proposed to use
weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) interpolation to recover function
values between grid points, therefore to update solutions at the next time
level. The proposed algorithm does not have time step restriction as Eulerian
approach and enjoys high order spatial and temporal accuracy. However, such
finite difference algorithm does not enjoy mass conservation; we discuss one
possible way of resolving such issue and its potential challenge in numerical
stability. The performance of the proposed schemes are numerically demonstrated
via classical test problems such as Landau damping and two stream
instabilities.

measured GMC properties. Using a hydrodynamical simulation of a barred spiral
galaxy, we compared the physical properties of GMCs formed in
position-position-position space (PPP) to the observational
position-position-velocity space (PPV). We assessed the effect of disc
inclination: face-on (PPV_face) and edge-on (PPV_edge), and resolution: 1.5 pc
versus 24 pc, on GMC properties and the further implications of using Larson's
scaling relations for mass-radius and velocity dispersion-radius. The
low-resolution PPV data are generated by simulating ALMA Cycle 3 observations
using the CASA package. Results show that the median properties do not differ
strongly between PPP and PPV_face under both resolutions, but PPV_edge clouds
deviate from these two. The differences become magnified when switching to the
lower, but more realistic resolution. The discrepancy can lead to opposite
results for the virial parameter's measure of gravitational binding, and
therefore the dynamical state of the clouds. The power-law indices for the two
Larson's scaling relations decrease going from PPP, PPV_face to PPV_edge and
decrease from high to low resolutions. We conclude that the relations are not
entirely driven by the underlying physical origin and therefore have to be used

new design of an external memory, wherein memories are stored in an Euclidean
key space $\mathbb R^n$. An LSTM controller performs read and write via
specialized read and write heads. It can move a head by either providing a new
address in the key space (aka random access) or moving from its previous
position via a Lie group action (aka Lie access). In this way, the ""L"" and ""R""
instructions of a traditional Turing Machine are generalized to arbitrary
elements of a fixed Lie group action. For this reason, we name this new model
the Lie Access Neural Turing Machine, or LANTM.
  We tested two different configurations of LANTM against an LSTM baseline in
several basic experiments. We found the right configuration of LANTM to
outperform the baseline in all of our experiments. In particular, we trained
LANTM on addition of $k$-digit numbers for $2 \le k \le 16$, but it was able to
generalize almost perfectly to $17 \le k \le 32$, all with the number of
parameters 2 orders of magnitude below the LSTM baseline.

Empirical Bayes (EB) statistical tests using moderated genewise variances have
been very effective for this purpose, especially when the number of biological
replicate samples is small. The EB procedures can however be heavily influenced
by a small number of genes with very large or very small variances. This
article improves the differential expression tests by robustifying the
hyperparameter estimation procedure. The robust procedure has the effect of
decreasing the informativeness of the prior distribution for outlier genes
while increasing its informativeness for other genes. This effect has the
double benefit of reducing the chance that hypervariable genes will be
spuriously identified as DE while increasing statistical power for the main
body of genes. The robust EB algorithm is fast and numerically stable. The
procedure allows exact small-sample null distributions for the test statistics
and reduces exactly to the original EB procedure when no outlier genes are
present. Simulations show that the robustified tests have similar performance
to the original tests in the absence of outlier genes but have greater power
and robustness when outliers are present. The article includes case studies for
which the robust method correctly identifies and downweights genes associated
with hidden covariates and detects more genes likely to be scientifically
relevant to the experimental conditions. The new procedure is implemented in
the limma software package freely available from the Bioconductor repository.

cues to reduce the semantic gap for image retrieval applications in today's
Multimodal Image Retrieval (MIR) systems. However, all tags are treated as
equally important in these systems, which may result in misalignment between
visual and textual modalities during MIR training. This will further lead to
degenerated retrieval performance at query time. To address this issue, we
investigate the problem of tag importance prediction, where the goal is to
automatically predict the tag importance and use it in image retrieval. To
achieve this, we first propose a method to measure the relative importance of
object and scene tags from image sentence descriptions. Using this as the
ground truth, we present a tag importance prediction model to jointly exploit
visual, semantic and context cues. The Structural Support Vector Machine (SSVM)
formulation is adopted to ensure efficient training of the prediction model.
Then, the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is employed to learn the
relation between the image visual feature and tag importance to obtain robust
retrieval performance. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show a
significant performance improvement of the proposed MIR with Tag Importance

$\rightarrow$ SO(2) is applicable for a ferrimagnet as well as a ferromagnet
and an antiferromagnet. The analysis of the particle states shows that there
exist not only massless modes with the dispersion relations $\omega \propto
|\bm{k}|,\, |\bm{k}|^2$, i.e., the so-called type-I and type-II Nambu-Goldstone
modes, respectively, but also gapped modes with $\omega \propto
m^2+|\bm{k}|^2$. We clarify how the coefficients of the terms with one time
derivative and those with two time derivatives in the effective Lagrangian
determine the order parameters specifying whether the system is in a
ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic state; we stress that the
gapped mode related to the spontaneous symmetry breaking appears only in the
ferrimagnetic system and not in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
systems. We also establish the power counting scheme and calculate the
scattering amplitudes and thereby the scattering lengths between the two
Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We show that the scattering length of the gapped mode
is finite and proportional to the gap. This characteristic property of the
gapped NG mode can be used to discriminate it from gapped excitations which
originate in other mechanisms. Finally, we study the effects of the explicit
symmetry breaking that are given by an external magnetic field and a single-ion
anisotropy, and show that the external magnetic fields do not have any effects
on the scattering amplitudes in all the spin systems as was known for the
ferromagnet system. In contrast, the anisotropy does affect the scattering
amplitudes, the phase shift, and the scattering length except for spin 1/2
systems. This result supports the possibility of the Efimov effect in spin
systems discussed in previous studies.

that the emerging correlation-induced stresses are scale-dependent. Each of
these stresses can be expanded into the sum of two components. The first one
depends on the local values of the dislocation densities and always opposes the
sum of the applied stress and long-range mean field stress generated by the
geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density; this stress acts as a
friction stress. The second component depends on the local gradients of the
dislocation densities and is inherently associated to a translation of the
elastic domain; therefore, it acts as a back-stress. We also show that these
friction and back- stresses contain symmetry-breaking components that make the
local stress experienced by dislocations to depend on the sign of their Burgers
vector.

landscapes by assuming constant growth rates and random local movement.
Mounting evidence suggests, however, that demographic stochasticity,
environmental heterogeneity and non-random movement of individuals affect
considerably the spread dynamics. Here, we show that the dynamics of biological
invasions are controlled by the spatial heterogeneity of the resource
distribution. We show theoretically that increasing the landscape resource
autocorrelation length causes a reduction in the average speed of species
spread. Demographic stochasticity plays a key role in the slowdown, which is
streghtened when individuals can actively move towards resources. The reduction
in the front propagation speed is verified in laboratory microcosm experiments
with the flagellated protist Euglena gracilis by comparing spread in habitats
characterized by different resource heterogeneity. Our theoretical and
experimental findings highlight the need to account for the intrinsic
stochasticity of population dynamics to describe spread in spatially extended
landscapes, which are inevitably characterized by heterogeneous spatial
distributions of resources controlling vital rates. Our work identifies the
resource autocorrelation length as a key modulator and a simple measure of
landscape susceptibility to biological invasions, with implications for
predicting the characters of biological invasions within naturally
heterogeneous environmental corridors.

earthquake triggering generally considered only the stress changes caused by
large events, and often discarded data uncertainties. We conducted a robust
two-fold empirical test of the static stress change hypothesis by accounting
for all events of magnitude M>=2.5 and their location and focal mechanism
uncertainties provided by catalogs for Southern California between 1981 and
2010, first after resolving the focal plane ambiguity and second after randomly
choosing one of the two nodal planes. For both cases, we find compelling
evidence supporting the static triggering with stronger evidence after
resolving the focal plane ambiguity above significantly small (about 10 Pa) but
consistently observed stress thresholds. The evidence for the static triggering
hypothesis is robust with respect to the choice of the friction coefficient,
Skempton's coefficient and magnitude threshold. Weak correlations between the
Coulomb Index (fraction of earthquakes that received positive Coulomb stress
change) and the coefficient of friction indicate that the role of normal stress
in triggering is rather limited. Last but not the least, we determined that the
characteristic time for the loss of the stress change memory of a single event
is nearly independent of the amplitude of the Coulomb stress change and varies
between ~95 and ~180 days implying that forecasts based on static stress
changes will have poor predictive skills beyond times that are larger than a
few hundred days on average.

nebulae (PNe) with supposed weak emission-line (WEL) central stars. The Wide
Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) on the ANU 2.3 m telescope has been used to provide
IFU spectroscopy for NGC 3211, NGC 5979, My 60, and M 4-2 covering the spectral
range of 3400-7000{\AA}. All objects are high excitation non-Type I PNe, with
strong He II emission, strong [Ne V] emission, and weak low-excitation lines.
They all appear to be predominantly optically-thin nebulae excited by central
stars with $T_{\rm eff} > 10^5$K. Three PNe of the sample have central stars
which have been previously classified as weak emission-line stars (WELS), and
the fourth also shows the characteristic recombination lines of a WELS.
However, the spatially-resolved spectroscopy shows that rather than arising in
the central star, the C IV and N III recombination line emission is distributed
in the nebula, and in some cases concentrated in discrete nebular knots. This
may suggest that the WELS classification is spurious, and that, rather, these
lines arise from (possibly chemically enriched) pockets of nebular gas. Indeed,
from careful background subtraction we were able to identify three of the
sample as being hydrogen rich O(H)-Type. We have constructed fully
self-consistent photoionization models for each object. This allows us to
independently determine the chemical abundances in the nebulae, to provide new
model-dependent distance estimates, and to place the central stars on the H-R
diagram. All four PNe have similar initial mass ($1.5 < M/M_{\odot} <2.0$) and
are at a similar evolutionary stage.

wireless body area network (WBAN). In this paper, We propose a distributed
\textit{C}ombined carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance
(CSMA/CA) with \textit{F}lexible time division multiple access (\textit{T}DMA)
scheme for \textit{I}nterference \textit{M}itigation in relay-assisted
intra-WBAN, namely, CFTIM. In CFTIM scheme, non interfering sources
(transmitters) use CSMA/CA to communicate with relays. Whilst, high interfering
sources and best relays use flexible TDMA to communicate with coordinator (C)
through using stable channels. Simulation results of the proposed scheme are
compared to other schemes and consequently CFTIM scheme outperforms in all
cases. These results prove that the proposed scheme mitigates interference,
extends WBAN energy lifetime and improves the throughput. To further reduce the
interference level, we analytically show that the outage probability can be
effectively reduced to the minimal.

mixed smoothness is studied here. This problem has a long history and some
fundamental problems in the area are still open. The main goal of this paper is
to develop a new method of proving the upper bounds for the entropy numbers.
This method is based on recent developments of nonlinear approximation, in
particular, on greedy approximation. This method consists of the following two
steps strategy. At the first step we obtain bounds of the best m-term
approximations with respect to a dictionary. At the second step we use general
inequalities relating the entropy numbers to the best m-term approximations.
For the lower bounds we use the volume estimates method, which is a well known
powerful method for proving the lower bounds for the entropy numbers. It was
used in a number of previous papers.

base stations (BS) are connected to a central processor (CP) via
finite-capacity backhaul links. We propose two lattice-based coding schemes. In
the first scheme, the base stations decode linear combinations of the
transmitted messages, in the spirit of compute-and-forward (CoF), but differs
from it essentially in that the decoded equations are remapped to linear
combinations of the channel input symbols, sent compressed in a lossy manner to
the central processor, and are not required to be linearly independent. Also,
by opposition to the standard CoF, an appropriate multi-user decoder is
utilized to recover the sent messages. The second coding scheme generalizes the
first one by also allowing, at each relay node, a joint compression of the
decoded equation and the received signal. Both schemes apply in general, but
are more suited for situations in which there are more users than base
stations. We show that both schemes can outperform standard CoF and successive
Wyner-Ziv schemes in certain regimes, and illustrate the gains through some
numerical examples.

the order of joins and combining results of intermediate subqueries. Recently,
several approaches have been proposed for algorithms that are ""worst-case
optimal"" wherein all relations are scanned simultaneously. An example is
Veldhuizen's Leapfrog Trie Join (LFTJ). An important advantage of LFTJ is its
small memory footprint, due to the fact that intermediate results are full
tuples that can be dumped immediately. However, since the algorithm does not
store intermediate results, recurring joins must be reconstructed from the
source relations, resulting in excessive memory traffic. In this paper, we
address this problem by incorporating caches into LFTJ. We do so by adopting
recent developments on join optimization, tying variable ordering to tree
decomposition. While the traditional usage of tree decomposition computes the
result for each bag in advance, our proposed approach incorporates caching
directly into LFTJ and can dynamically adjust the size of the cache.
Consequently, our solution balances memory usage and repeated computation, as
confirmed by our experiments over SNAP datasets.

probability that one user can successfully download its requested file either
from the local cache or via the backhaul link. We first consider a single-cell
scenario and derive a closed-form expression for the USP, which helps reveal
the impacts of various parameters, such as the file popularity distribution.
More specifically, for a highly concentrated file popularity distribution, the
required cache size is independent of the total number of files, while for a
less concentrated file popularity distribution, the required cache size is in
linear relation to the total number of files. Furthermore, we study the
multi-cell scenario, and provide a bisection search algorithm to find the
optimal cache size allocation. The optimal cache size allocation is verified by
simulations, and it is shown to play a more significant role when the file

approximation scheme to estimate the probability that a graph $G$ becomes
disconnected, given that its edges are removed independently with probability
$p$. This algorithm runs in $n^{5+o(1)} \epsilon^{-3}$ time to obtain an
estimate within relative error $\epsilon$.
  We improve this run-time through algorithmic and graph-theoretic advances.
First, there is a certain key sub-problem encountered by Karger, for which a
generic estimation procedure is employed, we show that this has a special
structure for which a much more efficient algorithm can be used. Second, we
show better bounds on the number of edge cuts which are likely to fail. Here,
Karger's analysis uses a variety of bounds for various graph parameters, we
show that these bounds cannot be simultaneously tight. We describe a new graph
parameter, which simultaneously influences all the bounds used by Karger, and
obtain much tighter estimates of the cut structure of $G$. These techniques
allow us to improve the runtime to $n^{3+o(1)} \epsilon^{-2}$, our results also
rigorously prove certain experimental observations of Karger & Tai (Proc.
ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 1997). Our rigorous proofs are
motivated by certain non-rigorous differential-equation approximations which,
however, provably track the worst-case trajectories of the relevant parameters.
  A key driver of Karger's approach (and other cut-related results) is a bound
on the number of small cuts: we improve these estimates when the min-cut size

in three-dimensional (2,0) supergravity theory. By using isometry-invariant
tensors and simple counting, we prove their existence for arbitrary $(2,0)$
supergravity models suitably defined close to a minimal model. We also analyze
their offshell supersymmetry and the supersymmetry of two geometric orbifolds.

for the detector performance. In order to reduce muon background, magnetized
muon sweepers have been used as a shielding material that is already described
in a previous study for CLIC [1]. The realistic muon sweeper has been designed
with OPERA. The design parameters of muon sweeper have also been used to
estimate muon background reduction with BDSIM Monte Carlo simulation code [2,

processes on domains separated by semi-permeable membranes, when diffusion
coefficients tend to infinity while the flux through the membranes remains
constant. In the limit, points in each domain are lumped into a single state of
a limit Markov chain. The limit chain's intensities are proportional to the
membranes' permeability and inversely proportional to the domains' sizes.
Analytically, the limit is an example of a singular perturbation in which
boundary and transmission conditions play a crucial role. This averaging
principle is strongly motivated by recent signaling pathways models of
mathematical biology, which are discussed towards the end of the paper.

  arXiv:1505.02041",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a specific class of events of the SUSY particle production at the
LHC without missing p_T. Namely, we discuss the chargino pair production with a
further decay into the W-boson and the neutralino when the masses of the
chargino and neutralino differ by 80-90 GeV. In this case, in the final state
one has two Ws and missing E_T but no missing P_T. The produced neutralinos are
just boosted along Ws. For a demonstration we consider the MSSM with
non-universal gaugino masses. In this case, such events are quite probable in
the region of parameter space where the lightest chargino and neutralino are
mostly gauginos. The excess in the W production cross-section reach about 10 %
over the Standard Model background. We demonstrate that the LHC experiments,
which presently measure the WW production cross section at the 8 % level can
probe chargino mass around 110 GeV within the suggested scenario, which is not
accessible via other searches. If the precision of WW cross section measurement
at the LHC will achieve the 3 % level, then it would probe chargino masses up
to about 150 GeV within the no missing P_T scenario.

  University of Leuven, Belgium",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This document describes a class of C functions implementing a distributed
software voting mechanism for EPX or similar message passing multi-threaded
environments. Such a tool may be used for example, to set up a restoring organ,
i.e., an NMR (i.e., N-module redundant) system with N voters. In order to
describe the tool we start defining its basic building block, the voter. A
voter is defined as a software module connected to one user module and to a
farm of fellow voters arranged into a clique. By means of the functions in the
class the user module is able: to create a static ""picture"" of the voting farm,
needed for the set up of the clique; to instantiate the local voter; to send
input or control messages to that voter. No interlocutor is needed other than
the local voter. The other user modules are supposed to create coherent
pictures and instances of voters on other nodes of the machine and to manage
consistently the task of their local intermediary. All technicalities
concerning the set up of the clique and the exchange of messages between the
voters are completely transparent to the user module. In the following the
basic functionalities of the VotingFarm class will be discussed, namely how to
set up a ""passive farm"", or a non-alive topological representation of a
yet-to-be-activated voting farm; how to initiate the voting farm; how to
control the farm.
