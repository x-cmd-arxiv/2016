  arXiv:1407.2730",,,,"cs.SY cs.FL math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Formal control synthesis approaches over stochastic systems have received
significant attention in the past few years, in view of their ability to
provide provably correct controllers for complex logical specifications in an
automated fashion. Examples of complex specifications of interest include
properties expressed as formulae in linear temporal logic (LTL) or as automata
on infinite strings. A general methodology to synthesize controllers for such
properties resorts to symbolic abstractions of the given stochastic systems.
Symbolic models are discrete abstractions of the given concrete systems with
the property that a controller designed on the abstraction can be refined (or
implemented) into a controller on the original system. Although the recent
development of techniques for the construction of symbolic models has been
quite encouraging, the general goal of formal synthesis over stochastic control
systems is by no means solved. A fundamental issue with the existing techniques
is the known ""curse of dimensionality,"" which is due to the need to discretize
state and input sets and that results in an exponential complexity over the
number of state and input variables in the concrete system. In this work we
propose a novel abstraction technique for incrementally stable stochastic
control systems, which does not require state-space discretization but only
input set discretization, and that can be potentially more efficient (and thus
scalable) than existing approaches. We elucidate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach by synthesizing a schedule for the coordination of two
traffic lights under some safety and fairness requirements for a road traffic
model. Further we argue that this 5-dimensional linear stochastic control
system cannot be studied with existing approaches based on state-space
discretization due to the very large number of generated discrete states.

acyclic one. Semantic acyclicity has been studied in the constraint-free case,
and deciding whether a query enjoys this property is NP-complete. However, in
case the database is subject to constraints such as tuple-generating
dependencies (tgds) that can express, e.g., inclusion dependencies, or
equality-generating dependencies (egds) that capture, e.g., functional
dependencies, a CQ may turn out to be semantically acyclic under the
constraints while not semantically acyclic in general. This opens avenues to
new query optimization techniques. In this paper we initiate and develop the
theory of semantic acyclicity under constraints. More precisely, we study the
following natural problem: Given a CQ and a set of constraints, is the query
semantically acyclic under the constraints, or, in other words, is the query
equivalent to an acyclic one over all those databases that satisfy the set of
constraints? We show that, contrary to what one might expect, decidability of
CQ containment is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the decidability
of semantic acyclicity. In particular, we show that semantic acyclicity is
undecidable in the presence of full tgds (i.e., Datalog rules). In view of this
fact, we focus on the main classes of tgds for which CQ containment is
decidable, and do not capture the class of full tgds, namely guarded,
non-recursive and sticky tgds. For these classes we show that semantic
acyclicity is decidable, and its complexity coincides with the complexity of CQ
containment. In the case of egds, we show that for keys over unary and binary
predicates semantic acyclicity is decidable (NP-complete). We finally consider
the problem of evaluating a semantically acyclic query over a database that
satisfies a set of constraints; for guarded tgds and functional dependencies
this problem is tractable.

cannot be avoided. In this paper, we examine the influence of disorder on such
a multi-atom lasing setup. We find that the lasing process evolves into a
self-organized stationary state that is quite robust against disorder. The
reason is that photons created by those atoms which are in or close to
resonance with the resonator stimulate the emission also of more detuned atoms.
Not only the number of photons grows with the number of atoms, but also the
width of the resonance as function of the detuning. Similar properties are
found for other types of disorder such as variations in the individual

discs may exist. We then use Monte-Carlo radiative transfer to generate
synthetic ALMA images of these self-gravitating discs to determine the subset
of this parameter space in which they generate non-axisymmetric structure that
is potentially detectable by ALMA. Recently, several transition discs have been
observed to have non-axisymmetric structure that extends out to large radii. It
has been suggested that one possible origin of these asymmetries could be
spiral density waves induced by disc self-gravity. We use our simple model to
see if these discs exist in the region of parameter space where self-gravity
could feasibly explain these spiral features. We find that for self-gravity to
play a role in these systems typically requires a disc mass around an order of
magnitude higher than the observed disc masses for the systems. The spiral
amplitudes produced by self-gravity in the local approximation are relatively
weak when compared to amplitudes produced by tidal interactions, or spirals
launched at Lindblad resonances due to embedded planets in the disc. As such,
we ultimately caution against diagnosing spiral features as being due to

entanglement entropy of a ball-shaped region may be computed as a perturbative
expansion in the coupling. A similar perturbative expansion exists for excited
states near the vacuum. Using these expansions, this work investigates the
behavior of excited state entanglement entropies of small, ball-shaped regions.
The motivation for these calculations is Jacobson's recent work on the
equivalence of the Einstein equation and the hypothesis of maximal vacuum
entropy [arXiv:1505.04753], which relies on a conjecture stating that the
behavior of these entropies is sufficiently similar to a CFT. In addition to
the expected type of terms which scale with the ball radius as $R^d$, the
entanglement entropy calculation gives rise to terms scaling as $R^{2\Delta}$,
where $\Delta$ is the dimension of the deforming operator. When
$\Delta\leq\frac{d}{2}$, the latter terms dominate the former, and suggest that
a modification to the conjecture is needed.

ALICE experiment. The aim is to more effectively combine the particle
identification capabilities of its various detectors. After a brief explanation
of the adopted methodology and formalism, the performance of the Bayesian PID
approach for charged pions, kaons and protons in the central barrel of ALICE is
studied. PID is performed via measurements of specific energy loss
($\mathrm{d}E/\mathrm{d}x$) and time-of-flight. PID efficiencies and
misidentification probabilities are extracted and compared with Monte Carlo
simulations using high-purity samples of identified particles in the decay
channels ${\rm K}^0_S \rightarrow \pi^-\pi^+$, $\phi \rightarrow {\rm K}^-{\rm
K}^+$, and $\Lambda \rightarrow {\rm p}\pi^-$ in p-Pb collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV. In order to thoroughly assess the validity of the
Bayesian approach, this methodology was used to obtain corrected $p_{\rm T}$
spectra of pions, kaons, protons, and D$^0$ mesons in pp collisions at
$\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV. In all cases, the results using Bayesian PID were found to be
consistent with previous measurements performed by ALICE using a standard PID
approach. For the measurement of D$^0 \rightarrow {\rm K}^-\pi^+$, it was found
that a Bayesian PID approach gave a higher signal-to-background ratio and a
similar or larger statistical significance when compared with standard PID
selections, despite a reduced identification efficiency. Finally, we present an
exploratory study of the measurement of $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}\rightarrow {\rm p}
{\rm K}^-\pi^+$ in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV, using the Bayesian

observations to study the effect of growing ice melt from Antarctica and
Greenland. Meltwater tends to stabilize the ocean column, inducing amplifying
feedbacks that increase subsurface ocean warming and ice shelf melting. Cold
meltwater and induced dynamical effects cause ocean surface cooling in the
Southern Ocean and North Atlantic, thus increasing Earth's energy imbalance and
heat flux into most of the global ocean's surface. Southern Ocean surface
cooling, while lower latitudes are warming, increases precipitation on the
Southern Ocean, increasing ocean stratification, slowing deepwater formation,
and increasing ice sheet mass loss. These feedbacks make ice sheets in contact
with the ocean vulnerable to accelerating disintegration. We hypothesize that
ice mass loss from the most vulnerable ice, sufficient to raise sea level
several meters, is better approximated as exponential than by a more linear
response. Doubling times of 10, 20 or 40 years yield multi-meter sea level rise
in about 50, 100 or 200 years. Recent ice melt doubling times are near the
lower end of the 10-40 year range, but the record is too short to confirm the
nature of the response. The feedbacks, including subsurface ocean warming, help
explain paleoclimate data and point to a dominant Southern Ocean role in
controlling atmospheric CO2, which in turn exercised tight control on global
temperature and sea level. The millennial (500-2000 year) time scale of deep
ocean ventilation affects the time scale for natural CO2 change and thus the
time scale for paleo global climate, ice sheet, and sea level changes, but this
paleo millennial time scale should not be misinterpreted as the time scale for
ice sheet response to a rapid large human-made climate forcing.

Absorption features in the spectrum of the star-forming complex are weaker than
in the surroundings. An absorption feature is found near 1.78um that coincides
with the location of a C2 bandhead. Emission lines of Brgamma, [FeII], and
HeI2.06um do not track the NIR continuum light. Pockets of star-forming
activity that do not have associated concentrations of red supergiants, and so
likely have ages < 8 Myr, are found along the western edge of the complex, and
there is evidence that one such pocket contains a rich population of Wolf-Rayet
stars. Unless the star-forming complex is significantly more metal-poor than
the surroundings, then a significant fraction of its total mass is in stars
with ages < 8 Myr. If the present-day star formation rate is maintained then
the time scale to double its stellar mass ranges from a few Myr to a few tens
of Myr, depending on the contribution made by stars older than ~ 8 Myr. If --
as suggested by some studies -- the star-forming complex is centered on the
galaxy nucleus, then the nucleus of NGC 253 is currently experiencing a phase
of rapid growth in its stellar mass.

potential to speed up training of neural networks by correcting for the

impractical to compute for large models, and most approximations either require
an expensive iterative procedure or make crude approximations to the curvature.
We present Kronecker Factors for Convolution (KFC), a tractable approximation
to the Fisher matrix for convolutional networks based on a structured
probabilistic model for the distribution over backpropagated derivatives.
Similarly to the recently proposed Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature
(K-FAC), each block of the approximate Fisher matrix decomposes as the
Kronecker product of small matrices, allowing for efficient inversion. KFC
captures important curvature information while still yielding comparably
efficient updates to stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We show that the
updates are invariant to commonly used reparameterizations, such as centering
of the activations. In our experiments, approximate natural gradient descent
with KFC was able to train convolutional networks several times faster than
carefully tuned SGD. Furthermore, it was able to train the networks in 10-20
times fewer iterations than SGD, suggesting its potential applicability in a

operators by means of the FFT usually yields very large speedups. When there
are incomplete observations (e.g., in the case of unknown boundaries), standard
deconvolution techniques normally involve non-diagonalizable operators,
resulting in rather slow methods, or, otherwise, use inexact convolution
models, resulting in the occurrence of artifacts in the enhanced images. In
this paper, we propose a new deconvolution framework for images with incomplete
observations that allows us to work with diagonalized convolution operators,
and therefore is very fast. We iteratively alternate the estimation of the
unknown pixels and of the deconvolved image, using, e.g., an FFT-based
deconvolution method. This framework is an efficient, high-quality alternative
to existing methods of dealing with the image boundaries, such as edge
tapering. It can be used with any fast deconvolution method. We give an example
in which a state-of-the-art method that assumes periodic boundary conditions is
extended, through the use of this framework, to unknown boundary conditions.
Furthermore, we propose a specific implementation of this framework, based on
the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We provide a proof of
convergence for the resulting algorithm, which can be seen as a ""partial"" ADMM,
in which not all variables are dualized. We report experimental comparisons
with other primal-dual methods, where the proposed one performed at the level
of the state of the art. Four different kinds of applications were tested in
the experiments: deconvolution, deconvolution with inpainting, superresolution,
and demosaicing, all with unknown boundaries.

analytics workloads to scale out to run on thousands of cores. Canary is
motivated by the observation that a central scheduler is a bottleneck for high
performance codes: a handful of multicore workers can execute tasks faster than
a controller can schedule them.
  The key insight in Canary is to reverse the responsibilities between
controllers and workers. Rather than dispatch tasks to workers, which then
fetch data as necessary, in Canary the controller assigns data partitions to
workers, which then spawn and schedule tasks locally.
  We evaluate three benchmark applications in Canary on up to 64 servers and
1,152 cores on Amazon EC2. Canary achieves up to 9-90X speedup over Spark and
up to 4X speedup over GraphX, a highly optimized graph analytics engine. While
current centralized schedulers can schedule 2,500 tasks/second, each Canary
worker can schedule 136,000 tasks/second per core and experiments show this
scales out linearly, with 64 workers scheduling over 120 million tasks per
second, allowing Canary to support optimized jobs running on thousands of
cores.

support extremely high data rate services in future wireless networks. MmWave
communications exhibit high penetration loss (blockage) and require directional
transmissions to compensate for severe channel attenuations and for high noise
powers. When blockage occurs, there are at least two simple prominent options:
1) switching to the conventional microwave frequencies (fallback option) and 2)
using an alternative non-blocked path (relay option). However, currently it is
not clear under which conditions and network parameters one option is better
than the other. To investigate the performance of the two options, this paper
proposes a novel blockage model that allows deriving maximum achievable
throughput and delay performance of both options. A simple criterion to decide
which option should be taken under which network condition is provided. By a
comprehensive performance analysis, it is shown that the right option depends
on the payload size, beam training overhead, and blockage probability. For a
network with light traffic and low probability of blockage in the direct link,
the fallback option is throughput- and delay-optimal. For a network with heavy
traffic demands and semi-static topology (low beam-training overhead), the
relay option is preferable.

applications. However, some challenges continue to impede development of high
aluminum-containing devices. The two major difficulties are growth of high
crystalline quality films with aluminum-rich compositions, and efficiently
doping such films p-type. These problems have severely limited use of
aluminum-rich nitride films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. A way around these
problems is through use of a liquid-metal-enabled approach to molecular beam
epitaxy. Although the presence of a liquid metal layer at the growth front is
reminiscent of conventional liquid phase epitaxy, this approach is different in
its details. Conventional liquid epitaxy is a near-thermodynamic equilibrium
process which liquid-metal assisted molecular beam epitaxy is not. Growth of
aluminum-rich nitrides is primarily driven by the kinetics of the molecular
vapor fluxes, and the surface diffusion of adatoms through a liquid metal layer
before incorporation. This paper reports on growth of high crystalline quality
and highly doped aluminum-containing nitride films. Measured optical and
electrical characterization data show that the approach is viable for growth of
atomically smooth aluminum-containing nitride heterostructures. Extremely high
p-type doping of up to $6 \times 10$$^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$ and n-type doping of up
to $1 \times 10$$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ in Al$_{0.7}$Ga$_{0.3}$N films was achieved.
Use of these metal-rich conditions is expected to have a significant impact on
high efficiency and high power optoelectronic and electronic devices that
require both high crystalline quality and highly doped (Al,Ga)N films.

FlashEigen performs sparse matrix multiplication in a semi-external memory

performance through caching the most recent dense matrix. Our result shows that
FlashEigen is able to achieve 40%-60% performance of its in-memory

dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) to study Ni E$_g$ $d$-orbital
polarization in strained LaNiO$_3$/LaAlO$_3$ superlattices consisting of four
layers of nominally metallic NiO$_2$ and four layers of insulating AlO$_2$
separated by LaO layers. The layer-resolved orbital polarization is calculated
as a function of strain and analyzed in terms of structural, quantum
confinement, and correlation effects. The effect of strain is determined from
the dependence of the results on the Ni-O bond-length ratio and the octahedral
rotation angles; quantum confinement is studied by comparison to bulk
calculations with similar degrees of strain; correlation effects are inferred
by varying interaction parameters within our DFT+DMFT calculations. The
calculated dependence of orbital polarization on strain in superlattices is
qualitatively consistent with recent X-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant
reflectometry data. However, interesting differences of detail are found
between theory and experiment. Under tensile strain, the two inequivalent Ni
ions display orbital polarization similar to that calculated for strained bulk
LaNiO$_3$ and observed in experiment. Compressive strain produces a larger
dependence of orbital polarization on Ni position and even the inner Ni layer
exhibits orbital polarization different from that calculated for strained bulk
LaNiO$_3$.

  In this direction, we establish quantum versions of several fundamental
classical results. First, we develop natural definitions for private-key and
public-key encryption schemes for quantum data. We then define notions of
semantic security and indistinguishability, and, in analogy with the classical
work of Goldwasser and Micali, show that these notions are equivalent. Finally,
we construct secure quantum encryption schemes from basic primitives. In

disruption events (TDEs) can launch relativistic jets. Super-Eddington
accretion produces a strong radiation field of order Eddington luminosity. In a
jetted TDE, electrons in the jet will inverse-Compton scatter the external
radiation field from the accretion disk and wind. Motivated by observations of
thermal optical-UV spectra in Swift J2058+05 and several other TDEs, we assume
the spectrum of the external radiation field intercepted by the relativistic
jet to be blackbody. Hot electrons in the jet scatter this thermal radiation
and produce luminosities 10^45-10^48 erg/s in the X/gamma-ray band.
  This model of thermal plus inverse-Compton radiation is applied to Swift
J2058+05. First, we show that the blackbody component in the optical-UV
spectrum most likely has its origin in the super-Eddington wind from the disk.
Then, using the observed blackbody component as the external radiation field,
we show that the X-ray luminosity and spectrum are consistent with the
inverse-Compton emission, under the following conditions: (1) the jet Lorentz
factor is ~5-10; (2) electrons in the jet have a powerlaw distribution with
minimum Lorentz factor ~1 and powerlaw index p = 2.4; (3) the wind is mildly
relativistic (Lorentz factor >~1.5) and has isotropic-equivalent mass-loss rate

In order to
shed light on this question ---especially aspects of this question such as a
black hole's negative specific heat---we consider the real-time dynamics of a
solitonic object in matrix quantum mechanics, which can be interpreted as a
black hole (black zero-brane) via holography. We point out that the chaotic
nature of the system combined with the flat directions of its potential
naturally leads to the emission of D0-branes from the black brane, which is
suppressed in the large $N$ limit. Simple arguments show that the black
zero-brane, like the Schwarzschild black hole, has negative specific heat, in
the sense that the temperature goes up when it evaporates by emitting
D0-branes. While the largest Lyapunov exponent grows during the evaporation,
the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy decreases. These are consequences of the generic
properties of matrix models and gauge theory. Based on these results, we give a
possible geometric interpretation of the eigenvalue distribution of matrices in
terms of gravity.
  Applying the same argument in the M-theory parameter region, we provide a
scenario to derive the Hawking radiation of massless particles from the
Schwarzschild black hole. Finally, we suggest that by adding a fraction of the
quantum effects to the classical theory, we can obtain a matrix model whose
classical time evolution mimics the entire life of the black brane, from its
formation to the evaporation.

remain invariant under the transformation $T^a_b \to T^a_b + \delta^a_b

proportional to the area measure of an equi-geodesic surface, centered at that

zero-point length in order for $f$ to remain finite. (3) The dynamics is
determined by extremizing the heat density at all events of the spacetime. The
heat density is the sum of a part contributed by matter and a part contributed
by the atoms of spacetime, with the latter being $L_P^{-4} f$. The implications

electronic repulsion, the antiferromagnetic correlations of the impurity
lattice are driven by a super-exchange interaction with SU(4) symmetry, which
emerges from the bound states degeneracy at quarter filling. We propose that
quantum spin-orbital liquids can be engineered in artificially designed
solid-state systems at vastly higher temperatures than achievable in optical

case of conventional Fermi liquids. We derive the theory of the nematic state

procedure which maps an electron liquid in half-filled Landau levels into the
composite Fermi liquid close to a nematic transition. We show that the local
fluctuations of the nematic order parameters act as an effective dynamical
metric interplaying with the underlying Chern-Simons gauge fields associated
with the flux attachment. Both the fluctuations of the Chern-Simons gauge field
and the nematic order parameter can destroy the composite fermion
quasiparticles and drive the system into a non-Fermi liquid state. The
effective field theory for the isotropic-nematic phase transition has $z = 3$
dynamical exponent due to Landau damping effects. We show that there is a Berry
phase type term which governs the effective dynamics of the nematic order
parameter fluctuations, which can be interpreted as a non-universal ""Hall
viscosity"" of the dynamical metric. We show that the effective field theory has
a Wen-Zee-type term. Both terms originate from the time-reversal breaking
fluctuation of the Chern-Simons gauge fields. We present a perturbative
computation of the Hall viscosity and also show that this term is also obtained

supercurrent that can flow through a non-superconducting (N) material connected
to two superconducting electrodes, crucially depends on the lenghth of the N
relative to the superconducting coherence length. Using graphene as the N
material we have investigated the full range of the superconducting proximity
effect, from short to long diffusive junctions. By combining several
S/graphene/S samples with different contacts and lengths, and measuring their
gate-dependent critical currents ($ I_c $) and normal state resistance $ R_N $,
we compare the product $eR_NI_c$ to the relevant energies, the Thouless energy
in long junctions and the superconducting gap of the contacts in short
junctions, over three orders of magnitude of Thouless energy. The experimental
variations strikingly follow a universal law, close to the predictions of the
proximity effect both in the long and short junction regime, as well as in the
crossover region, thereby revealing the interplay of the different energy
scales. Differences in the numerical coefficients reveal the crucial role
played by the interfacial barrier between graphene and the superconducting
electrodes, which reduces the supercurrent in both short and long junctions.
Surprisingly the reduction of supercurrent is independent of the gate voltage
and of the nature of the electrodes. A reduced induced gap and Thouless energy
are extracted, revealing the role played by the dwell time in the barrier in
the short junction, and an effective increased diffusion time in the long
junction. We compare our results to the theoretical predictions of Usadel

exacerbate the error. Stochastic micromagnetic simulations at room temperature
are used to understand and calculate energy dissipations and switching error

that these quantities have an intriguing dependence on nanomagnet size: small
nanomagnets perform better owing to the fact that they are more resilient to
the formation of metastable states and magnetization dynamics in them is more
coherent. However, for a fixed stress anisotropy energy density, smaller
nanomagnets will also have poorer resilience against thermal instability. Thus,
the challenge in straintronics is to maximize the stress anisotropy energy
density by developing materials and processes that yield the largest
magnetostriction.

electromagnetism based on charge and magnetic flux conservation, the Lorentz
force and the constitutive relations which introduce the spacetime metric. We
then proceed with the tensor formulation by assuming local, linear, homogeneous
and isotropic constitutive relations, and explore the physical, observable
consequences of Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime. The field equations,
charge conservation and the Lorentz force are explicitly expressed in general
(pseudo) Riemanian manifolds. The generalized Gauss and Maxwell-Amp\`{e}re

astrophysical applications. In all cases new electromagnetic couplings and
related phenomena are induced by spacetime curvature. The implications and
possible applications for gravity waves detection are briefly addressed. At the
foundational level, we discuss the possibility of generalizing the vacuum
constitutive relations, by relaxing the fixed conditions of homogeneity and
isotropy, and by assuming that the symmetry properties of the electro-vacuum
follow the spacetime isometries. The implications of this extension are briefly
discussed in the context of the intimate connection between electromagnetism

rotation sensors can be used to subtract the tilt component from the signal

by the sensor noise of the tilt measurement. A different approach is to
mechanically filter the tilt transmitted to the horizontal inertial sensor, as
discussed in this article. This technique does not require an auxiliary
rotation sensor, and can produce a lower noise measurement. The concept
investigated uses a mechanical suspension to isolate the inertial sensor from
input tilt. Modeling and simulations show that such a configuration can be used
to adequately attenuate the tilt transmitted to the instrument, while
maintaining translation sensitivity in the frequency band of interest. The
analysis is supported by experimental results showing that this approach is a
viable solution to overcome the tilt problem in the field of active inertial

functions that incorporate contributions from gluons which bind quarks into
these mesons and hence overcome a flaw of the commonly used handbag
approximation. The distributions therewith obtained are purely valence in
character, ensuring that dressed-quarks carry all a meson's momentum at a
characteristic hadronic scale and vanishing as $(1-x)^2$ when Bjorken-$x\to 1$.
Comparing such distributions within the pion and kaon, it is apparent that the
size of SU(3)-flavour symmetry breaking in meson parton distribution functions
is modulated by the flavour dependence of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking.
Corrections to these leading-order formulae may be divided into two classes,
responsible for shifting dressed-quark momentum into glue and sea-quarks.
Working with available empirical information, we build an algebraic framework
that is capable of expressing the principal impact of both classes of
corrections. This enables a realistic comparison with experiment which allows
us to identify and highlight basic features of measurable pion and kaon
valence-quark distributions. We find that whereas roughly two-thirds of the
pion's light-front momentum is carried by valence dressed-quarks at a
characteristic hadronic scale, this fraction rises to 95% in the kaon; evolving
distributions with these features to a scale typical of available Drell-Yan
data produces a kaon-to-pion ratio of u-quark distributions that is in
agreement with the single existing data set; and predict a u-quark distribution
within the pion that agrees with a modern reappraisal of $\pi N$ Drell-Yan
data. Precise new data are essential in order to validate this reappraisal and
because a single modest-quality measurement of the kaon-to-pion ratio cannot be
considered definitive.

the first law of thermodynamics. We show that this connection holds well beyond
asymptotically AdS black holes. In particular, we formulate the variational
problem for $\mathcal{N}=2$ STU supergravity in four dimensions with boundary
conditions corresponding to those obeyed by the so called `subtracted
geometries'. We show that such boundary conditions can be imposed covariantly
in terms of a set of asymptotic second class constraints, and we derive the
appropriate boundary terms that render the variational problem well posed in
two different duality frames of the STU model. This allows us to define finite
conserved charges associated with any asymptotic Killing vector and to
demonstrate that these charges satisfy the Smarr formula and the first law of
thermodynamics. Moreover, by uplifting the theory to five dimensions and then
reducing on a 2-sphere, we provide a precise map between the thermodynamic
observables of the subtracted geometries and those of the BTZ black hole.
Surface terms play a crucial role in this identification.

  Deep Networks for Object Recognition","8 pages, 9 figures, <Under review in IJCNN 2016>",,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a spike-based unsupervised regenerative learning scheme to train
Spiking Deep Networks (SpikeCNN) for object recognition problems using
biologically realistic leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. The training
methodology is based on the Auto-Encoder learning model wherein the
hierarchical network is trained layer wise using the encoder-decoder principle.
Regenerative learning uses spike-timing information and inherent latencies to
update the weights and learn representative levels for each convolutional layer
in an unsupervised manner. The features learnt from the final layer in the
hierarchy are then fed to an output layer. The output layer is trained with
supervision by showing a fraction of the labeled training dataset and performs
the overall classification of the input. Our proposed methodology yields
0.92%/29.84% classification error on MNIST/CIFAR10 datasets which is comparable
with state-of-the-art results. The proposed methodology also introduces
sparsity in the hierarchical feature representations on account of event-based
coding resulting in computationally efficient learning.

Laplace-Beltrami operator on a closed surface. The new stabilization term
provides control of the full $\mathbb{R}^3$ gradient on the active mesh
consisting of the elements that intersect the surface. Compared to face
stabilization, based on controlling the jumps in the normal gradient across
faces between elements in the active mesh, the full gradient stabilization is
easier to implement and does not significantly increase the number of nonzero
elements in the mass and stiffness matrices. The full gradient stabilization
term may be combined with a variational formulation of the Laplace-Beltrami
operator based on tangential or full gradients and we present a simple and
unified analysis that covers both cases. The full gradient stabilization term
gives rise to a consistency error which, however, is of optimal order for
piecewise linear elements, and we obtain optimal order a priori error estimates
in the energy and $L^2$ norms as well as an optimal bound of the condition
number. Finally, we present detailed numerical examples where we in particular
study the sensitivity of the condition number and error on the stabilization
parameter.

observations, require regularization to be well defined, perform well
empirically, and possess theoretical guarantees. The amount of regularization,
often determined by tuning parameters, is integral to achieving good
performance. One can choose the tuning parameter in a variety of ways, such as
through resampling methods or generalized information criteria. However, the
theory supporting many regularized procedures relies on an estimate for the
variance parameter, which is complicated in high dimensions. We develop a suite
of information criteria for choosing the tuning parameter in lasso regression
by leveraging the literature on high-dimensional variance estimation. We derive
intuition showing that existing information-theoretic approaches work poorly in
this setting. We compare our risk estimators to existing methods with an
extensive simulation and derive some theoretical justification. We find that
our new estimators perform well across a wide range of simulation conditions

ICM, and dark matter components in galaxy clusters, we compiled the optical and
X-ray properties of a sample of 340 clusters with redshifts $<0.5$, based on
all the available data with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and {\it
Chandra}/{\it XMM-Newton}. For each cluster, the member galaxies were
determined primarily with photometric redshift measurements. The radial ICM
mass distribution, as well as the total gravitational mass distribution, were
derived from a spatially-resolved spectral analysis of the X-ray data. When
normalizing the radial profile of galaxy number to that of the ICM mass, the
relative curve was found to depend significantly on the cluster redshift; it
drops more steeply towards outside in lower redshift subsamples. The same
evolution is found in the galaxy-to-total mass profile, while the ICM-to-total
mass profile varies in an opposite way. We interpret that the galaxies, the
ICM, and the dark matter components had similar angular distributions when a
cluster was formed, while the galaxies travelling interior of the cluster have
continuously fallen towards the center relative to the other components, and
the ICM has slightly expanded relative to the dark matter although it suffers
strong radiative loss. This cosmological galaxy infall, accompanied by an ICM
expansion, can be explained by considering that the galaxies interact strongly
with the ICM while they are moving through it. The interaction is considered to
create a large energy flow of $10^{44-45}$ erg $\rm s^{-1}$ per cluster from
the member galaxies to their environment, which is expected to continue over
cosmological time scales.

of magnetotransport effects in LaBi and LaSb, we construct a triangular
temperature-field phase diagram that illustrates how a magnetic field tunes the
electronic behavior in these materials. We show that the triangular phase
diagram can be generalized to other topological semimetals with different
crystal structures and different chemical compositions. By comparing our
experimental results to band structure calculations, we suggest that extreme
magnetoresistance in LaBi and LaSb originates from a particular orbital texture
on their qasi-2D Fermi surfaces. The orbital texture, driven by spin-orbit
coupling, is likely to be a generic feature of various topological semimetals.

connections and are both computationally and memory intensive, making them
difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources and
power budgets. While custom hardware helps the computation, fetching weights
from DRAM is two orders of magnitude more expensive than ALU operations, and
dominates the required power.
  Previously proposed 'Deep Compression' makes it possible to fit large DNNs
(AlexNet and VGGNet) fully in on-chip SRAM. This compression is achieved by
pruning the redundant connections and having multiple connections share the
same weight. We propose an energy efficient inference engine (EIE) that
performs inference on this compressed network model and accelerates the
resulting sparse matrix-vector multiplication with weight sharing. Going from
DRAM to SRAM gives EIE 120x energy saving; Exploiting sparsity saves 10x;
Weight sharing gives 8x; Skipping zero activations from ReLU saves another 3x.
Evaluated on nine DNN benchmarks, EIE is 189x and 13x faster when compared to
CPU and GPU implementations of the same DNN without compression. EIE has a
processing power of 102GOPS/s working directly on a compressed network,
corresponding to 3TOPS/s on an uncompressed network, and processes FC layers of
AlexNet at 1.88x10^4 frames/sec with a power dissipation of only 600mW. It is
24,000x and 3,400x more energy efficient than a CPU and GPU respectively.

bits from biased random sources, are important objects both in theory and in
practice. While there have been significant progress in obtaining near optimal
constructions of randomness extractors in various settings, the computational
complexity of randomness extractors is still much less studied. In particular,
it is not clear whether randomness extractors with good parameters can be
computed in several interesting complexity classes that are much weaker than P.
  In this paper we study randomness extractors in the following two models of
computation: (1) constant-depth circuits (AC0), and (2) the local computation
model. Previous work in these models, such as [Vio05a], [GVW15] and [BG13],
only achieve constructions with weak parameters. In this work we give explicit
constructions of randomness extractors with much better parameters. As an
application, we use our AC0 extractors to study pseudorandom generators in AC0,
and show that we can construct both cryptographic pseudorandom generators
(under reasonable computational assumptions) and unconditional pseudorandom
generators for space bounded computation with very good parameters.
  Our constructions combine several previous techniques in randomness
extractors, as well as introduce new techniques to reduce or preserve the
complexity of extractors, which may be of independent interest. These include
(1) a general way to reduce the error of strong seeded extractors while
preserving the AC0 property and small locality, and (2) a seeded randomness
condenser with small locality.

scenario, the goal is to minimize the total required transmit power of UAVs
while satisfying the users' rate requirements. To this end, the optimal
locations of UAVs as well as the cell boundaries of their coverage areas are
determined. To find those optimal parameters, the problem is divided into two
sub-problems that are solved iteratively. In the first sub-problem, given the
cell boundaries corresponding to each UAV, the optimal locations of the UAVs
are derived using the facility location framework. In the second sub-problem,
the locations of UAVs are assumed to be fixed, and the optimal cell boundaries
are obtained using tools from optimal transport theory. The analytical results
show that the total required transmit power is significantly reduced by
determining the optimal coverage areas for UAVs. These results also show that,
moving the UAVs based on users' distribution, and adjusting their altitudes can
lead to a minimum power consumption. Finally, it is shown that the proposed
deployment approach, can improve the system's power efficiency by a factor of
20 compared to the classical Voronoi cell association technique with fixed UAVs

large electrical conductivity due to the more spread unoccupied $e_{g}$ band of

arise, including: Which are the fundamental limits in multi-image alignment

Theoretical bounds provide a fundamental benchmark to compare methods and can
help establish whether improvements can be made. In this work, we tackle the
problem of finding the performance limits in image registration when multiple
shifted and noisy observations are available. We derive and analyze the
Cram\'er-Rao and Ziv-Zakai lower bounds under different statistical models for
the underlying image. The accuracy of the derived bounds is experimentally
assessed through a comparison to the maximum likelihood estimator. We show the
existence of different behavior zones depending on the difficulty level of the

increasing the number of images is only useful below a certain SNR threshold,

during its outburst in September 2014. Based on data of eight outbursts
observed in the last 10 years we expected to catch the start of the
hard-to-soft state transition. The fact that neither the general shape of the
observed power density spectrum nor the characteristic frequency show an energy
dependence implies that the source still stays in the low-hard state at the
time of our observation near outburst peak. The spectral properties agree with
the source being in the low-hard state and a Swift/XRT monitoring of the
outburst reveals that H 1743-322 stays in the low-hard state during the entire
outburst (a. k. a. 'failed outburst'). We derive the averaged QPO waveform and
obtain phase-resolved spectra. Comparing the phase-resolved spectra to the
phase averaged energy spectrum reveals spectral pivoting. We compare
variability on long and short time scales using covariance spectra and find
that the covariance ratio does not show an increase towards lower energies as
has been found in other black hole X-ray binaries. There are two possible
explanations: either the absence of additional disc variability on longer time

3.60 to $\sim$28.5, 28.1, and 30.7 mag in image stacks of 11-15 galaxies in the

The stacked AGN LyC light profiles are flatter than their corresponding
non-ionizing UV continuum profiles out to radii of r$\lesssim$0.""9, which may
indicate a radial dependence of porosity in the ISM. With synthetic stellar

at $z$$\simeq$2. Dust accumulating in (massive) galaxies over cosmic time
correlates with increased HI column density, which may lead to reducing $f_{\rm

often inspired by manifold learning algorithms. They ensure that the hash

encourage codes to be orthogonal or dissimilar across bits, but this couples
the binary variables and complicates the already difficult optimization. We
propose a much simpler approach: we train each hash function (or bit)

techniques from classifier ensembles. Surprisingly, we find that not only is
this faster and trivially parallelizable, but it also improves over the more

variations of millimeter wave (mmW) communications is to deploy dual-mode base
stations that integrate both mmW and microwave (\muW) frequencies. Reaping the
benefits of a dual-mode operation requires scheduling mechanisms that can
allocate resources efficiently and jointly at both frequency bands. In this
paper, a novel resource allocation framework is proposed that exploits users'
context, in terms of user application (UA) delay requirements, to maximize the
quality-of-service (QoS) of a dual-mode base station. In particular, such a
context-aware approach enables the network to dynamically schedule UAs, instead
of users, thus providing more precise delay guarantees and a more efficient
exploitation of the mmW resources. The scheduling of UAs is formulated as a
one-to-many matching problem between UAs and resources and a novel algorithm is
proposed to solve it. The proposed algorithm is shown to converge to a
two-sided stable matching between UAs and network resources. Simulation results
show that the proposed approach outperforms classical CSI-based scheduling in
terms of the per UA QoS, yielding up to 36% improvement. The results also show
that exploiting mmW resources provides significant traffic offloads reaching up
to 43% from \muW band.

Cantor minimal dynamical systems using properly ordered Bratteli diagrams. In
this study, we adopt this definition to the case of all essentially minimal
zero-dimensional systems. We consider the cases in which topological ranks are
2 and unique minimal sets are fixed points. Akin and Kolyada (2003), in their
study of Li--Yorke sensitivity, showed that if the unique minimal set of an
essentially minimal system is a fixed point, then the system must be proximal.
However, a finite topological rank implies expansiveness; furthermore, in the
case of proximal Cantor systems with topological rank 2, the expansiveness is
always from the lowest degree.
  Rank 2 zero-dimensional systems might be thought as a part of the rank 1
transformations that are considered in the vast field of ergodic theory.
However, these systems are also interesting from the perspective of topological
chaos theory; e.g., in this study, we show that all proximal Cantor systems
with topological rank 2 are residually scrambled. In addition, we investigate
the finite invariant measures on these systems. Evidently, such systems have at
most two ergodic measures. We present a necessary and sufficient condition for
the unique ergodicity of these systems. In addition, we show that the number of
ergodic measures of systems that are topologically mixing can be 1 and 2.
Moreover, we present examples that are topologically weakly mixing, not

multiuser multi-input single-output (MISO) downlink scenario and under
inaccurate channel state information (CSI). This robust problem deals with a
general-rank transmit covariance design, and it follows a safe rate-constrained
formulation under spherically bounded CSI uncertainties. Curiously, simulation
results in previous works suggested that the robust problem admits rank-one
optimal transmit covariances in most cases. Such a numerical finding is
appealing because transmission with rank-one covariances can be easily realized
by single-stream transmit beamforming. This gives rise to a fundamentally
important question, namely, whether we can theoretically identify conditions
under which the robust problem admits a rank-one solution. In this paper, we
identify one such condition. Simply speaking, we show that the robust problem
is guaranteed to admit a rank-one solution if the CSI uncertainties are not too
large and the multiuser channel is not too poorly conditioned. To establish the
aforementioned condition, we develop a novel duality framework, through which
an intimate relationship between the robust problem and a related maximin
problem is revealed. Our condition involves only a simple expression with
respect to the multiuser channel and other system parameters. In particular,
unlike other sufficient rank-one conditions that have appeared in the
literature, ours is verifiable. The application of our analysis framework to
several other CSI uncertainty models is also discussed.

applications, in which an agent should decide on immediate actions so as to
optimize a long term objective. For example, when a car tries to merge in a
roundabout it should decide on an immediate acceleration/braking command, while
the long term effect of the command is the success/failure of the merge. Such
problems are characterized by continuous state and action spaces, and by
interaction with multiple agents, whose behavior can be adversarial. We argue
that dual versions of the MDP framework (that depend on the value function and
the $Q$ function) are problematic for autonomous driving applications due to
the non Markovian of the natural state space representation, and due to the
continuous state and action spaces. We propose to tackle the planning task by
decomposing the problem into two phases: First, we apply supervised learning
for predicting the near future based on the present. We require that the
predictor will be differentiable with respect to the representation of the
present. Second, we model a full trajectory of the agent using a recurrent

multiple agents into a joint decision. If preferences are binary, i.e., ""yes""
and ""no"", every voting system can be described by a (monotone) Boolean function
$\chi\colon\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$. However, its naive encoding needs
$2^n$ bits. The subclass of threshold functions, which is sufficient for
homogeneous agents, allows a more succinct representation using $n$ weights and
one threshold. For heterogeneous agents, one can represent $\chi$ as an
intersection of $k$ threshold functions. Taylor and Zwicker have constructed a
sequence of examples requiring $k\ge 2^{\frac{n}{2}-1}$ and provided a
construction guaranteeing $k\le {n\choose {\lfloor n/2\rfloor}}\in 2^{n-o(n)}$.
The magnitude of the worst-case situation was thought to be determined by
Elkind et al.~in 2008, but the analysis unfortunately turned out to be wrong.
Here we uncover a relation to coding theory that allows the determination of
the minimum number $k$ for a subclass of voting systems. As an application, we
give a construction for $k\ge 2^{n-o(n)}$, i.e., there is no gain from a
representation complexity point of view.

captures first and second order statistics. Instead of directly classifying
each Fisher vector, it is converted into a vector of class probabilities. The

response to a harmonic modulation. Such instability has special names in
various branches of physics and is generally known as modulation instability

breather solutions of the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation (NLSE) are known to

thanks to the simultaneous readout of a 1020 pixels array at 2 mm and 1140 x 2

enhanced gas density vortex where the dust is trapped potentially promoting the
rapid growth to the planetesimal scale. AB Aur hosts a transitional disk with a
clear horseshoe morphology which strongly suggests the presence of a dust trap.
Our goal is to investigate its formation and the possible effects on the gas

investigate the chemical changes within the disk. We have used a single point
(n,T) chemical model to investigate the lifetime of gaseous CO, H2CO and SO in
the dust trap. Our model shows that for densities >10^7 cm^-3, the SO molecules
are depleted (directly frozen or converted into SO2 and then frozen out) in
less than 0.1 Myr. The lower SO abundance towards the dust trap could indicate
that a larger fraction of the gas is in a high density environment. Gas
dynamics, grain growth and gas chemistry are coupled in the planet formation
process. Because of the strong dependence of SO abundance on the gas density,
the sulfur chemistry can be used as a chemical diagnostic to detect the
birthsites of future planets. However, the large uncertainties inherent to
chemical models and the limited knowledge of the disk physical structure and
initial conditions are important drawbacks.

models of high particle number systems give more clear and comprehensive
physical descriptions of those systems than purely kinetic approaches, and can
be more easily tested experimentally as well as numerically. In particular, we
aim at developing a theory that describes both a background non-equilibrium
fluid configurations and its perturbations, to be able to account for the
backreaction of the latter on the former. Our system of equations includes the
usual conservation laws for the energy-momentum tensor and for the electric
current, and the equations for two new tensors that encode the information
about dissipation. To make contact with kinetic theory, we write the different
tensors as the moments of a non-equilibrium one-particle distribution function
(1pdf) which, for illustrative purposes, we take in the form of a Grad-like
ansatz. Although this choice limits the applicability of the formalism to
states not far from equilibrium, it retains the main features of the underlying
kinetic theory. We assume the validity of the Vlasov-Boltzmann equation, with a
collision integral given by the Anderson-Witting prescription, which is more
suitable for highly relativistic systems than Marle's (or Bhatnagar, Gross and
Krook) form, and derive the conservation laws by taking its corresponding
moments. We apply our developments to study the emergence of instabilities in
an anisotropic, but axially symmetric background. For small departures of
isotropy we find the dispersion relation for normal modes, which admit unstable

over the past few years, from local observables, to global network properties.
In this paper we introduce a novel layer of network dynamics which lives and
evolves on top of the ad hoc network. Nodes are assumed selfish and a
snow-drift type game is defined dictating the way nodes decide to allocate
their cooperative resource efforts towards other nodes in the network. The
dynamics are strongly coupled with the physical network causing the cooperation
network topology to converge towards a stable equilibrium state, a global
maximum of the total pay-off. We study this convergence from a connectivity
perspective and analyse the inherent parameter dependence. Moreover, we show
that direct reciprocity can be an efficient incentive to promote cooperation
within the network and discuss the analogies between our simple yet tractable
framework with D2D proximity based services such as LTE-Direct. We argue that
cooperative network dynamics have many application in ICT, not just ad hoc
networks, and similar models as the one described herein can be devised and
studied in their own right.

studying one of their deviations from complex quantum theory: the
non-commutativity of phases. We do so by passing single photons through a
Sagnac interferometer containing two physically different phases, having
refractive indices of opposite sign. By showing that the phases commute with
high precision, we place limits on a particular prediction of hyper-complex

various challenging computer vision tasks. Especially in object localization,
deep convolutional neural networks outperform traditional approaches based on
extraction of data/task-driven features instead of hand-crafted features.
Although location information of region-of-interests (ROIs) gives good prior
for object localization, it requires heavy annotation efforts from human
resources. Thus a weakly supervised framework for object localization is
introduced. The term ""weakly"" means that this framework only uses image-level
labeled datasets to train a network. With the help of transfer learning which
adopts weight parameters of a pre-trained network, the weakly supervised
learning framework for object localization performs well because the
pre-trained network already has well-trained class-specific features. However,
those approaches cannot be used for some applications which do not have
pre-trained networks or well-localized large scale images. Medical image
analysis is a representative among those applications because it is impossible
to obtain such pre-trained networks. In this work, we present a ""fully"" weakly
supervised framework for object localization (""semi""-weakly is the counterpart
which uses pre-trained filters for weakly supervised localization) named as
self-transfer learning (STL). It jointly optimizes both classification and
localization networks simultaneously. By controlling a supervision level of the
localization network, STL helps the localization network focus on correct ROIs
without any types of priors. We evaluate the proposed STL framework using two
medical image datasets, chest X-rays and mammograms, and achieve signiticantly
better localization performance compared to previous weakly supervised
approaches.

SDC (FWSW-SDC) iteration to converge and that in the limit of infinitely fast
waves the convergence rate of the non-split version is retained. Stability
function and discrete dispersion relation are derived and show that the method
is stable for essentially arbitrary fast-wave CFL numbers as long as the slow
dynamics are resolved. The method causes little numerical diffusion and its
semi-discrete phase speed is accurate also for large wave number modes.
Performance is studied for an acoustic-advection problem and for the linearised
Boussinesq equations, describing compressible, stratified flow. FWSW-SDC is

compound $\beta$-TeVO$_4$ is reported. Three magnetic transitions observed in
zero magnetic field are tracked in fields applied along different
crystallographic directions using magnetization, heat capacity, and
magnetostriction measurements. Qualitatively different temperature-field
diagrams are obtained below 10 T for the field applied along $a$ or $b$ and
along $c$, respectively. In contrast, a nearly isotropic high-field phase
emerges above 18 T and persists up to the saturation that occurs around 22.5 T.
Upon cooling in low fields, the transitions at $T_{\rm N1}$ and $T_{\rm N2}$
toward the spin-density-wave and stripe phases are of the second order, whereas
the transition at $T_{\rm N3}$ toward the helical state is of the first order
and entails a lattice component. Our microscopic analysis identifies frustrated
$J_1-J_2$ spin chains with a sizable antiferromagnetic interchain coupling in
the $bc$ plane and ferromagnetic couplings along the $a$ direction. The
competition between these ferromagnetic interchain couplings and the helical
order within the chain underlies the incommensurate order along the
$a$-direction, as observed experimentally. Although a helical state is
triggered by the competition between $J_1$ and $J_2$ within the chain, the
plane of the helix is not uniquely defined because of competing magnetic
anisotropies. Using high-resolution synchrotron diffraction and $^{125}$Te
nuclear magnetic resonance, we also demonstrate that the crystal structure of
$\beta$-TeVO$_4$ does not change down to 10 K, and the orbital state of
V$^{4+}$ is preserved.

cluster NGC 6397 based on more than ~18,000 spectra obtained with the novel
integral field spectrograph MUSE. While NGC 6397 is often considered a core
collapse cluster, our analysis suggests a flattening of the surface brightness
profile at the smallest radii. Although it is among the nearest globular
clusters, the low velocity dispersion of NGC 6397 of <5km/s imposes heavy
demands on the quality of the kinematical data. We show that despite its
limited spectral resolution, MUSE reaches an accuracy of 1km/s in the analysis
of stellar spectra. We find slight evidence for a rotational component in the
cluster and the velocity dispersion profile that we obtain shows a mild central
cusp. To investigate the nature of this feature, we calculate spherical Jeans
models and compare these models to our kinematical data. This comparison shows
that if a constant mass-to-light ratio is assumed, the addition of an
intermediate-mass black hole with a mass of 600M_sun brings the model
predictions into agreement with our data, and therefore could be at the origin
of the velocity dispersion profile. We further investigate cases with varying
mass-to-light ratios and find that a compact dark stellar component can also
explain our observations. However, such a component would closely resemble the
black hole from the constant mass-to-light ratio models as this component must
be confined to the central ~5arcsec of the cluster and must have a similar
mass. Independent constraints on the distribution of stellar remnants in the
cluster or kinematic measurements at the highest possible spatial resolution
should be able to distinguish the two alternatives.

segmentation with signed scalar of vertex is utilized to partition the inner
surface from the input surface mesh based on the indicated point loop. Then,
the offset surface of the inner surface is obtained through contouring the
distance field of the inner surface, and segmented to generate the outer

Finally, drilling tubes are generated according to the preoperative plan

evolution of the matter created in heavy-ion collisions. The quark-gluon plasma
(QGP) formed in heavy-ion collisions evolves from an initial QGP to the
hadronic phase via a possible mixed phase. Due to the system expansion in a
first order phase transition scenario, the speed of sound reduces to zero as
the specific heat diverges. We study the speed of sound for systems, which
deviate from a thermalized Boltzmann distribution using non-extensive Tsallis
statistics. In the present work, we calculate the speed of sound as a function
of temperature for different $q$-values for a hadron resonance gas. We observe
a similar mass cut-off behaviour in non-extensive case for $c^{2}_s$ by
including heavier particles, as is observed in the case of a hadron resonance
gas following equilibrium statistics. Also, we explicitly present that the
temperature where the mass cut-off starts, varies with the $q$-parameter which
hints at a relation between the degree of non-equilibrium and the limiting
temperature of the system. It is shown that for values of $q$ above
approximately 1.13 all criticality disappear in the speed of sound, i.e. the
decrease in the value of the speed of sound, observed at lower values of $q$,
disappears completely.

using a full-spectrum fitting method based on a large grid of PHOENIX spectra.
Results. With 18,932 spectra from 12,307 stars in NGC 6397 we have analysed the
largest sample so far available for a single globular cluster. We derived a
mean radial velocity of vrad=17.84+-0.07 km/s and a mean metallicity of

stars on the RGB. We determine T_eff and [Fe/H] from the spectra, and log g
from HST photometry. This is the first very comprehensive HRD for a globular
cluster based on the analysis of several thousands of stellar spectra, ranging
from the main sequence to the tip of the RGB. Furthermore, two interesting
objects were identified with one being a post-AGB star and the other a possible

however assumed that these reproduction processes are i.i.d. point processes

branching process explodes, that is, the process reaches infinitely many
individuals in finite time. We develop comparison techniques between
reproduction processes. We study special cases in terms of explosivity such as
age-dependent BPs, and epidemic models with contagious intervals. For this, we
superimpose a random contagious interval $[I, C]$ on every individual in the BP
and keep only the children with birth-times that fall in this interval of the

sub-micron thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films using lock-in thermography

observe asymmetric heat transport by magnons which leads to asymmetric
temperature profiles differing by several mK on both sides of the exciting
antenna, respectively. Comparison of Damon-Eshbach and backward volume modes
shows that the unidirectional heat flow is indeed due to non-reciprocal
spin-waves. Because of the finite linewidth, small asymmetries can still be
observed when only the uniform mode of ferromagnetic resonance is excited. The
latter is of extreme importance for example when measuring the inverse
spin-Hall effect because the temperature differences can result in
thermovoltages at the contacts. Because of the non-reciprocity these
thermovoltages reverse their sign with a reversal of the magnetic field which
is typically deemed the signature of the inverse spin-Hall voltage.

Our results are compared to currently available closure phase observational

its magnitude are strongly model dependent. We find that both the jet and the

Its variability has been ascribed to a sudden and repetitive increase of the
circumstellar extinction (UXor-type variable), but the physical origin of such
variation, although hypothesized, has not been fully supported on observational
basis. To get a new insight into the variability of V1184 Tau, we present new
photometric and spectroscopic observations taken in the period 2008-2015.
During these years the source has reached the same high brightness level that
had before the remarkable fading of about 5 mag undergone in 2004. The optical
spectrum is the first obtained when the continuum is at its maximum level. The
observations are interpreted in the framework of extinction driven variability.
We analyze light curves, optical and near-infrared colors, SED and optical
spectrum. The emerging picture indicates that the source fading is due to an
extinction increase of DeltaA_V about 5 mag, associated with a strong infrared
excess, attributable to a thermal component at T=1000 K. From the flux of
H(alpha) we derive a mass accretion rate between 10^-11 -5 10^-10 M_sun yr^-1
s, consistent with that of classical T Tauri stars of similar mass. The source
SED was fitted for both the high and low level of brightness. A scenario
consistent with the known stellar properties (such as spectral type, mass and
radius) is obtained only if the distance to the source is of few hundreds of
parsecs, in contrast with the commonly assumed value of 1.5 kpc. Our analysis
partially supports that presented by Grinin (2009), according to which the
circumstellar disk undergoes a periodical puffing, whose observational effects
are both to shield the central star and to evidence a disk wind activity.
However, since the mass accretion rate remains almost constant with time, the
source is likely not subject to accretion bursts.

with distinct exponents at the boundary and in the bulk, but boundary and bulk

model. For nonintegrable models, we argue that the power-law decay of the
oscillations is generic for autocorrelations in the bulk, but turns into an

excitations. The predictions of our effective field theory are compared with

of the field which cannot be fully eliminated in the experiment. Despite the

theory system of equations, that is, using $F=0$ to eliminate all auxiliary

of UHECR motion from Virgo A taking into account their deflections in galactic

comparable with GMF one, moreover the influence of EGMF sometimes is
dominating; 2) effect of EGMF demonstrates obvious asymmetry in the final

protective mechanisms against reactive oxygen species. During charge separation
in photosynthetic reaction centres, triplet states can react with molecular
oxygen generating destructive singlet oxygen. The triplet product yield in
bacteria is observed to be reduced by weak magnetic fields. Reaction centres
from plants' photosystem II share many features with bacterial reaction
centres, including a high-spin iron whose function has remained obscure. To
explain observations that the magnetic field effect is reduced by the iron, we
propose that its fast-relaxing spin plays a protective role in photosynthesis
by generating an effective magnetic field. We consider a simple model of the
system, derive an analytical expression for the effective magnetic field and
analyse the resulting triplet yield reduction. The protective mechanism is
robust for realistic parameter ranges, constituting a clear example of a
quantum effect playing a macroscopic role vital for life.

is no sense to minimize the loss on the training set too much, as it will not

the ratio between the number of constraints and the number of variables is
varied. When this ratio exceeds the satisfiability threshold no more solutions
exist; the satisfiable phase, for less constrained problems, is itself divided
in an unclustered regime and a clustered one. In the latter solutions are
grouped in clusters of nearby solutions separated in configuration space from
solutions of other clusters. In addition the rigidity transition signals the
appearance of so-called frozen variables in typical solutions: beyond this
threshold most solutions belong to clusters with an extensive number of
variables taking the same values in all solutions of the cluster. In this paper
we refine the description of this phenomenon by estimating the location of the
freezing transition, corresponding to the disappearance of all unfrozen
solutions (not only typical ones). We also unveil phase transitions for the
existence and uniqueness of locked solutions, in which all variables are
frozen. From a technical point of view we characterize atypical solutions with

(LHC) heavy-ion collisions are investigated in the framework of the Heavy Ion
Jet Interaction Generator (HIJING) code incorporated with a collective cascade
recipe. The latter is used to implement energy-momentum conservation constrains
on both primary and secondary interacting nucleons. It is found that the
energy-momentum conservation constrains on the interacting nucleons affect the
whole charged particle pseudo-rapidity density distribution
$(\frac{dN_{ch}}{d\eta})$, at different centralities (from central (0-5\%) to
peripheral (70-80\%) collisions), in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =2.76$
TeV. In particular, the kinematic constrains on interacting nucleons are shown
to reduce $(\frac{dN_{ch}}{d\eta})$ yield at mid-pseudorapidity
$(\lvert\eta\rvert<2)$ in all centrality intervals, which is consistent with
the LHC data. In addition, the model predicts an enhancement of the hadron
production at $\lvert\eta\rvert>8$, which could be checked in future ALICE Zero
Degree calorimeter. Such an enhancement is found to be mainly due to the
interactions of protons at the spectator parts of the collision. This indicates
that the kinematic constrains are important for a correct geometrical treatment
of Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energies.

Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) finite volume scheme on moving
nonconforming polygonal grids, in order to avoid the typical mesh distortion
caused by shear flows in Lagrangian-type methods. In our new approach the
nonconforming element interfaces are not defined by the user, but they are
automatically detected by the algorithm if the tangential velocity difference
across an element interface is sufficiently large. The grid nodes that are
sufficiently far away from a shear wave are moved with a standard node solver,
while at the interface we insert a new set of nodes that can slide in a
nonconforming manner. In this way, the elements on both sides of the shear wave
can move with a different velocity, without producing highly distorted
elements. The core of the proposed method is the use of a space-time
conservation formulation in the construction of the final finite volume scheme,
which completely avoids the need of an additional remapping stage and ensures
that the geometric conservation law (GCL) is automatically satisfied. Moreover,
the mesh quality remains high and, as a direct consequence, also the time step
remains almost constant in time, even for highly sheared vortex flows. The
accuracy of the new scheme has been further improved by incorporating a special
well balancing technique that is able to maintain particular stationary
solutions of the governing PDE system up to machine precision. A large set of
numerical tests has been carried out in order to check the accuracy and the
robustness of the new method. In particular we have compared the results for a
steady vortex in equilibrium solved with a standard conforming ALE method and
with our new nonconforming ALE scheme, to show that the new nonconforming
scheme is able to avoid mesh distortion even after very long simulation times.

divergence form and in its applications: the field and the flux of the solution
operator (applied to a general deterministic right-hand side), and the field
and the flux of the corrector. Homogenization is the study of the large-scale
properties of these objects. In case of random coefficients, these quantities
fluctuate and their fluctuations are a priori unrelated. Depending on the law
of the coefficient field, and in particular on the decay of its correlations on
large scales, these fluctuations may display different scalings and different
limiting laws (if any). In this contribution, we identify another crucial
intrinsic quantity, motivated by H-convergence, which we refer to as the
\emph{homogenization commutator} and is related to variational quantities first
considered by Armstrong and Smart. In the simplified setting of the random
conductance model, we show what we believe to be a general principle, namely
that the homogenization commutator drives at leading order the fluctuations of
each of the four other quantities in a strong norm in probability, which is
expressed in form of a suitable two-scale expansion and reveals the
\emph{pathwise structure} of fluctuations in stochastic homogenization. In
addition, we show that the (rescaled) homogenization commutator converges in
law to a Gaussian white noise, and we analyze to which precision the covariance
tensor that characterizes the latter can be extracted from the representative
volume element method. This collection of results constitutes a new theory of
fluctuations in stochastic homogenization that holds in any dimension and
yields optimal rates. Extensions to the (non-symmetric) continuum setting are
also discussed, the details of which are postponed to forthcoming works.

electric field outside the electrode sheaths, space and time resolved within
the RF period. Electrons are found to be heated by strong ambipolar electric
fields outside the sheath during the phase of sheath expansion in addition to
classical sheath expansion heating. By tracing individual electrons we also
show that ionization is primarily caused by electrons that collide with the
expanding sheath edge multiple times during one phase of sheath expansion due
to backscattering towards the sheath by collisions. A synergistic combination
of these different heating events during one phase of sheath expansion is
required to accelerate an electron to energies above the threshold for
ionization. The ambipolar electric field outside the sheath is found to be time
modulated due to a time modulation of the electron mean energy caused by the
presence of sheath expansion heating only during one half of the RF period at a
given electrode. This time modulation results in more electron heating than
cooling inside the region of high electric field outside the sheath on time
average. If an electric field reversal is present during sheath collapse, this
time modulation and, thus, the asymmetry between the phases of sheath expansion
and collapse will be enhanced. We propose that the ambipolar electron heating
should be included in models describing electron heating in capacitive RF
plasmas.

understand how angular momentum and mass are being radially transported in
these objects. Here, we study the role played by non-linear spiral patterns
within hydrodynamical and non self-gravitating accretion disc assuming that
external disturbances such as infall onto the disc may trigger them. To do so,
we computed self-similar solutions that describe discs in which a spiral wave
propagates. Such solutions present both shocks and critical sonic points that
we carefully analyze. For all allowed temperatures and for several spiral
shocks, we calculated the wave structure. In particular we inferred the angle
of the spiral patern, the stress it exerts on the disc as well as the
associated flux of mass and angular momentum as a function of temperature. We
quantified the rate of angular momentum transport by means of the dimensionless
$\alpha$ parameter. For the thickest disc we considered (corresponding to $h/r$
values of about 1/3), we found values of $\alpha$ as high as $0.1$, and scaling
with the temperature $T$ such that $\alpha \propto T^{3/2} \propto (h/r)^3$.
The spiral angle scales with the temperature as $\arctan(r/h)$. The existence
of these solutions suggests that perturbations occurring at disc outer
boundaries, such as for example perturbations due to infall motions, can
propagate deep inside the disc and therefore should not be ignored, even when
considering small radii.

calculate the conserved and thermodynamic quantities, which are fully

examining the validity of the first law of thermodynamics, we conduct a study
regarding the effects of different parameters on thermal stability of the

and thermodynamical pressure to study the possibility of phase transition.
Interestingly, we will show that for the specific configuration considered in
this paper, van der Waals like behavior is observed for different topology. In
other words, for flat and hyperbolic horizons, similar to spherical horizon, a
second order phase transition and van der Waals like behavior are observed.
Furthermore, we use geometrical method to construct phase space and study phase
transition and bound points for these black holes. Finally, we obtain critical
values in extended phase space through the use of a new method.

consistently described in terms of classical electrodynamics instead of taking
the electron to be a particle; we consider an electrically charged classical
wave field, an ""electron wave"", which is held in a limited region of space by
the electrostatic field of the proton. It is shown that quantum mechanics must
be considered to be not a theory of particles but a classical field theory in
the spirit of classical electrodynamics. In this case, we are not faced with
difficulties in interpreting the results of the theory. In the framework of
classical electrodynamics, all of the well-known regularities of the
spontaneous emission of the hydrogen atom are obtained, which is usually
derived in the framework of quantum electrodynamics. It is shown that there are
no discrete states and discrete energy levels of the atom: the energy of the
atom and its states change continuously. An explanation of the conventional
corpuscular-statistical interpretation of atomic phenomena is given. It is
shown that this explanation is only a misinterpretation of continuous
deterministic processes. In the framework of classical electrodynamics, the
nonlinear Schrodinger equation is obtained, which accounts for the inverse
action of self-electromagnetic radiation of the electron wave and completely
describes the spontaneous emissions of an atom.

fables in Ukrainian, Mykyta the Fox and Abu-Kasym's slippers. It consists of
two parts: the analysis of frequency-rank distributions of words and the
application of complex-network theory. The first part shows that the text sizes
are sufficiently large to observe statistical properties. This supports their
selection for the analysis of typical properties of the language networks in
the second part of the chapter. In describing language as a complex network,
while words are usually associated with nodes, there is more variability in the
choice of links and different representations result in different networks.
Here, we examine a number of such representations of the language network and
perform a comparative analysis of their characteristics. Our results suggest
that, irrespective of link representation, the Ukrainian language network used
in the selected fables is a strongly correlated, scale-free, small world. We
discuss how such empirical approaches may help form a useful basis for a
theoretical description of language evolution and how they may be used in
analyses of other textual narratives.
