billionth). Two sets of initial data, modelling simple shears and wall boundary
layers, are chosen for our computations. Most of the solutions are carried out
well into the fully turbulent regime over finely-resolved scales in space and
in time. It is found that an abrupt spatio-temporal concentration in shear
constitutes an essential part during the flow evolution. The vorticity surge
has been instigated by the non-linearity complying with instantaneous enstrophy
production, while ad hoc disturbances play no role in the process. In
particular, the present method predicts the precipitous vorticity
re-distribution and accumulation, predominantly over localised regions of
minute dimension. The growth rate depends on viscosity and is a strong function
of initial data. Nevertheless, the long-time energy decay is
history-independent and is inversely proportional to time. Our results provide
direct evidence of the vorticity proliferation embedded in the equations of
motion. The non-linear intensification is a robust feature, and is ultimately
responsible for the drastic succession in boundary layer profiles over the
intrinsic laminar-turbulent transition (Schubauer and Klebanoff 1955). The

detectors such as Kinetic Inductance Detectors requires knowledge of the
nonequilibrium quasiparticle energy distributions. We have previously
calculated the steady state distributions resulting from uniform absorption of
monochromatic sub gap and above gap frequency radiation by thin films. In this
work, we use the same methods to calculate the effect of illumination by
broadband sources, such as thermal radiation from astrophysical phenomena or
from the readout system. Absorption of photons at multiple above gap
frequencies is shown to not change the structure of the quasiparticle energy
distribution close to the superconducting gap. Hence for typical absorbed
powers, we find the effects of absorption of broadband pair breaking radiation
can simply be considered as the sum of the effects of absorption of many
monochromatic sources. Distribution averaged quantities, like quasiparticle
generation effciency $\eta$, match exactly a weighted average over the
bandwidth of the source of calculations assuming a monochromatic source. For
sub gap frequencies, however, distributing the absorbed power across multiple
frequencies does change the low energy quasiparticle distribution. For moderate
and high absorbed powers, this results in a significantly larger $\eta$ - a
higher number of excess quasiparticles for a broadband source compared to a
monochromatic source of equal total absorbed power. Typically in KIDs the
microwave power absorbed has a very narrow bandwidth, but in devices with broad
resonance characteristics (low quality factors), this increase in $\eta$ may be
measurable.

variations in Alfv\'{e}n speed and outflow velocity. The turbulence is driven
by nonlinear interactions between the counter-propagating Alfv\'{e}n waves.
Results are presented for two models of the background atmosphere. In the first
model the plasma density and Alfv\'{e}n speed vary smoothly with height,
resulting in minimal wave reflections and low energy dissipation rates. We find
that the dissipation rate is insufficient to maintain the temperature of the

dissipation rate significantly overestimates the rate derived from our RMHD
simulations, and a revised formula is proposed. In the second model we
introduce additional density variations along the flux tube with a correlation
length of 0.04 $R_\odot$ and with relative amplitude of $10 \%$. These density
variations simulate the effects of compressive MHD waves on the Alfv\'{e}n

set, but what constitutes a good clustering may depend on domain-specific and
application-specific criteria. These criteria can be difficult to formalize,
even when it is easy for an analyst to know a good clustering when she sees
one. We present a new approach to interactive clustering for data exploration,
called \ciif, based on a particularly simple feedback mechanism, in which an
analyst can choose to reject individual clusters and request new ones. The new
clusters should be different from previously rejected clusters while still
fitting the data well. We formalize this interaction in a novel Bayesian prior
elicitation framework. In each iteration, the prior is adapted to account for
all the previous feedback, and a new clustering is then produced from the
posterior distribution. To achieve the computational efficiency necessary for
an interactive setting, we propose an incremental optimization method over data
minibatches using Lagrangian relaxation. Experiments demonstrate that \ciif can
produce accurate and diverse clusterings.

The proposed integer linear programming formulation could greatly simplify the

invariance in the absence of the usual Einstein-Hilbert term and introducing
additionally either the Weyl derivative or properly rescaled fields. Such a
theory is constructed by considering the action of a non-minimally
conformally-coupled scalar field, and adding a second scalar allowing for a
nonminimal derivative coupling with the Einstein tensor and the energy-momentum
tensor of the first field. At a cosmological framework we obtain an effective
dark-energy sector constituted from both scalars. In the absence of an explicit
matter sector we extract analytical solutions, which for some parameter regions
correspond to an effective matter era and/or to an effective radiation era,
thus the two scalars give rise to ""mimetic dark matter"" or to ""dark radiation""

a cosmological evolution in agreement with observations, that is a transition
from matter to dark energy era, with the onset of cosmic acceleration.
Furthermore, for particular parameter regions, the effective dark-energy

on the basis of pairwise distances and a distance threshold. We tested three

average, internal branches in the FJ-BIC tree have higher bootstrap support
than branches in the leaf-labeled bifurcating tree constructed using RAxML.

interactions of swimming microscopic organisms with confining boundaries, or
each other, to be determined for arbitrary separation and, in particular, in
the close proximity regime where approximate methods based on point singularity
descriptions cease to be valid. We give a detailed description of the circular
motion of an arbitrary squirmer moving parallel to a no-slip spherical boundary
or flat free surface at close separation, finding that the circling generically
has opposite sense at free surfaces and at solid boundaries. While the
asymptotic interaction is symmetric under head-tail reversal of the swimmer, in
the near field microscopic structure can result in significant asymmetry. We
also find the translational velocity towards the surface for a simple model
with only the lowest two squirming modes. By comparing these to asymptotic
approximations of the interaction we find that the transition from near- to
far-field behaviour occurs at a separation of about two swimmer diameters.
These solutions are for the rotational velocity about the wall normal, or
common diameter of two spheres, and the translational speed along that same
direction, and are obtained using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem for Stokes
flows in conjunction with known solutions for the conjugate Stokes drag

the max-min fairness energy harvesting problem are formulated for both the
bounded CSI error model and the probabilistic CSI error model. These problems
are non-convex and challenging to solve. A one-dimensional search algorithm is
proposed to solve these problems based on ${\cal S}\text{-Procedure} $ under
the bounded CSI error model and based on Bernstein-type inequalities under the

prediction of superfluid phases with broken time-reversal or translational

Andreev scattering processes that create quasiparticle states with energies
inside the superconducting gap. These states cause profound restructuring of
the low-energy spectrum in the surface region of several coherence lengths
$\xi_0$ with large spatial variations of the superconducting order parameter.
In confined geometry, such as slabs, films, pores, or nano-dots, with one or
more physical dimensions $D \sim 10\xi_0$, Andreev bound states can dominate
properties of the superfluid phases, leading to modified experimental
signatures. They can dramatically change the energy landscape, and drive
transitions into new superfluid phases, that are typically unstable in the bulk
superfluid. On the examples of single-component singlet d-wave superconductor,
and triplet multi-component superfluid $^3$He I show how properties of
condensed phases in restricted geometry depend on the order parameter
structure. I will highlight the connection between Andreev bound states and
confinement-stabilized phases with additional broken symmetries, describe

The derivation of accurate dust parameters such as temperature ($T_{dust}$),
emissivity spectral index ($\beta$) and column density requires broadband
continuum observations at far-infrared wavelengths. We present Herschel-SPIRE
Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) measurements of three starless cores:
L1521E, L1521F and L1689B, covering wavelengths between 194 and 671 $\mu$m.
This paper is the first to use our recently updated SPIRE-FTS intensity
calibration, yielding a direct match with SPIRE photometer measurements of
extended sources. In addition, we carefully assess the validity of calibration
schemes depending on source extent and on the strength of background emission.
The broadband far-infrared spectra for all three sources peak near 250 $\mu$m.
Our observations therefore provide much tighter constraints on the spectral
energy distribution (SED) shape than measurements that do not probe the SED
peak. The spectra are fitted using modified blackbody functions, allowing both
$T_{dust}$ and $\beta$ to vary as free parameters. This yields $T_{dust}$ of
9.8$\pm$0.2 K, 15.6$\pm$0.5 K and 10.9$\pm$0.2 K and corresponding $\beta$ of

L1521E and L1689B exceed unity indicating that they are unstable to
gravitational collapse, and thus pre-stellar cores. By comparison, the elevated
temperature and gravitational stability of L1521F support previous arguments

two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard models, where the many-electron dynamics in the

is treated classically. The simulations are based on the solution of the
two-time Dyson (Keldysh-Kadanoff-Baym) equations using the second-order Born,
third-order and T-matrix approximations of the self-energy. As application, we
consider protons and helium nuclei with a kinetic energy between 1 and 500
keV/u passing through planar fragments of the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice
and, in particular, examine the influence of electron-electron correlations on
the energy exchange between projectile and electron system. We investigate the
time dependence of the projectile's kinetic energy (stopping power), the
electron density, the double occupancy and the photoemission spectrum. Finally,
we show that, for a suitable choice of the Hubbard model parameters, the
results for the stopping power are in fair agreement with ab-initio simulations

  Guarantees for Oja's Algorithm","Updated title",,,,"cs.LG cs.DS cs.NE stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work provides improved guarantees for streaming principle component
analysis (PCA). Given $A_1, \ldots, A_n\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ sampled
independently from distributions satisfying $\mathbb{E}[A_i] = \Sigma$ for
$\Sigma \succeq \mathbf{0}$, this work provides an $O(d)$-space linear-time
single-pass streaming algorithm for estimating the top eigenvector of $\Sigma$.
The algorithm nearly matches (and in certain cases improves upon) the accuracy
obtained by the standard batch method that computes top eigenvector of the
empirical covariance $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i \in [n]} A_i$ as analyzed by the
matrix Bernstein inequality. Moreover, to achieve constant accuracy, our
algorithm improves upon the best previous known sample complexities of
streaming algorithms by either a multiplicative factor of $O(d)$ or
$1/\mathrm{gap}$ where $\mathrm{gap}$ is the relative distance between the top
two eigenvalues of $\Sigma$.
  These results are achieved through a novel analysis of the classic Oja's
algorithm, one of the oldest and most popular algorithms for streaming PCA. In
particular, this work shows that simply picking a random initial point $w_0$
and applying the update rule $w_{i + 1} = w_i + \eta_i A_i w_i$ suffices to
accurately estimate the top eigenvector, with a suitable choice of $\eta_i$. We
believe our result sheds light on how to efficiently perform streaming PCA both
in theory and in practice and we hope that our analysis may serve as the basis
for analyzing many variants and extensions of streaming PCA.

expected to play a central role in 5th Generation (5G) cellular networks.
Overcoming the poor radio propagation and sensitivity to blockages at higher

research is focused at the physical layer. However, innovations will be
required at all layers of the protocol stack to effectively utilize the large

the location of the critical point of a noise-induced, finite-size transition
occurring in the model, on the local ordering of the system, and on the
functional form of its temporal correlations. Finally, we show how this latter

quantum Hall effect regime, have been stimulated by the search for evidence of
abelian and non-abelian anyonic statistics of fractional charges.These studies
found the ubiquitous electronic Fabry-Perot interferometer to be Coulomb
dominated, thus masking coherent Aharonov-Bohm interference. Typically, the
main signature of the Coulomb dominated regime is the lack of interference of
the outer most edge channel as the magnetic field is varied. This seemingly
surprising behavior is explained by the shrinkage of the interference area with
increasing magnetic field, thus keeping the number of electrons and the
enclosed flux constant. The model further stipulates, but with no experimental
evidence thus far, that once the area shrinks by a size corresponding to an
entire flux-quantum, it abruptly inflates to its original size leading to an
unobservable 2{\pi} phase jump. Here we report on the observation of such area
breathing by performing a partial screening of the Coulomb interactions. The
novelty is that the variation of the phase induced by the external knobs is not
fully cancelled by the area response. We infer the area variations (with a
resolution on the order of ~50 nm$^{2}$) from conductance measurements. The
latter are sensitive to the continuous phase variations, and reveal abrupt
phase-jumps (smaller than 2{\pi}). Based on our results, we propose a new
experimental tool for probing anyonic statistics.

parameters and elemental abundances. However, the number of synthetic spectra
needed for a rectilinear grid grows exponentially with the label space
dimensions, precluding the simultaneous and self-consistent fitting of more
than a few elemental abundances. Shortcuts such as fitting subsets of labels
separately can introduce unknown systematics and do not produce correct error
covariances in the derived labels. In this paper we present a new approach --
CHAT (Convex Hull Adaptive Tessellation) -- which includes several new ideas
for inexpensively generating a sufficient stellar synthetic library, using
linear algebra and the concept of an adaptive, data-driven grid. A convex hull
approximates the region where the data lie in the label space. A variety of
tests with mock datasets demonstrate that CHAT can reduce the number of
required synthetic model calculations by three orders of magnitude in an 8D
label space. The reduction will be even larger for higher-dimensional label
spaces. In CHAT the computational effort increases only linearly with the
number of labels that are fit simultaneously. Around each of these grid points
in label space an approximate synthetic spectrum can be generated through
linear expansion using a set of ""gradient spectra"" that represent flux
derivatives at every wavelength point with respect to all labels. These
techniques provide new opportunities to fit the full stellar spectra from large

explosions from the first stars on star-forming metal-free gas in a minihalo at
$z\sim25$. Starting from cosmological initial conditions, we use the smoothed
particle hydrodynamics code GADGET-2 to follow gas collapsing under the
influence of a CR background up to densities of $n=10^{12}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$, at
which point we form sink particles. Using a suite of simulations with two sets
of initial conditions and employing a range of CR background models, we follow
each simulation for $5000\,$yr after the first sink forms. CRs both heat and
ionise the gas, boosting ${\rm H}_2$ formation. Additional ${\rm H}_2$ enhances
the cooling efficiency of the gas, allowing it to fulfil the Rees-Ostriker
criterion sooner and expediting the collapse, such that each simulation reaches
high densities at a different epoch. As it exits the loitering phase, the
thermodynamic path of the collapsing gas converges to that seen in the absence
of any CR background. By the time the gas approaches sink formation densities,
the thermodynamic state of the gas is thus remarkably similar across all
simulations. This leads to a robust characteristic mass that is largely
independent of the CR background, of order $\sim$ a few $\times10\,{\rm
M}_{\odot}$ even as the CR background strength varies by five orders of
magnitude.

entropy inside ~R_500 is significantly higher than the baseline model, which is
similar to many other nearby low mass clusters or groups. The enclosed gas-mass

evidence of significant gas clumping, electron-ion non-equipartition, or
departure from the hydrostatic equilibrium approximation that are suggested to

disk, is surrounded by an optically and geometrically thick dusty structure
(""the so-called dusty torus""). The infrared radiation emitted by the dust is
nothing but a reprocessed fraction of the accretion disk emission, so the ratio
of the torus to the AGN luminosity ($L_{\text{torus}}/L_{\text{AGN}}$) should
correspond to the fraction of the sky obscured by dust, i.e. the covering
factor. We undertook a critical investigation of the
$L_{\text{torus}}/L_{\text{AGN}}$ as the dust covering factor proxy. Using
state-of-the-art 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, we calculated a grid
of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) emitted by the clumpy two-phase dusty
structure. With this grid of SEDs, we studied the relation between
$L_{\text{torus}}/L_{\text{AGN}}$ and the dust covering factor for different
parameters of the torus. We found that in the case of type 1 AGNs the torus
anisotropy makes $L_{\text{torus}}/L_{\text{AGN}}$ underestimate low covering
factors and overestimate high covering factors. In type 2 AGNs
$L_{\text{torus}}/L_{\text{AGN}}$ always underestimates covering factors. Our
results provide a novel easy-to-use method to account for anisotropy and obtain
correct covering factors. Using two samples from the literature, we
demonstrated the importance of our result for inferring the obscured AGN
fraction. We found that after the anisotropy is properly accounted for, the
dust covering factors show very weak dependence on $L_{\text{AGN}}$, with
values in the range of $\approx0.6-0.7$. Our results also suggest a higher
fraction of obscured AGNs at high luminosities than those found by X-ray

predicted by population synthesis models.

how the $z=0$ CGM varies across 5 orders of magnitude of stellar mass using OVI
and HI as proxies for hot and cold gas. The cool HI covering fraction and
column density profiles match observations well, particularly in the inner CGM.
OVI shows increasing column densities with mass, a trend seemingly echoed in
the observations. As in multiple previous simulations, the OVI column densities
in simulations are lower than observed and optically thick HI does not extend
as far out as in observations. We take a look at the collisional ionisation
fraction of OVI as a function of halo mass. We make observable predictions of
the bipolarity of outflows and their effect on the general shape of the CGM.
Bipolar outflows can be seen out to around 40 kpc in intermediate and low mass
halos ($M_{\mathrm{halo}}<10^{11}M_{\mathrm{sun}}$), but outside that radius,
the CGM is too well mixed to detect an elongated shape. Larger halos have
extended gas discs beyond the stellar disc that dominate the shape of the inner
CGM. The simulated CGM is remarkably spherical even in low mass simulations.
The chemical enrichment of both halo and disc gas follow expected increasing
trends as a function of halo mass that are well fit with power laws. These
relations can be used in non-hydrodynamic models, such as semi-analytic models.

because of their high flux density in the NIR wavelength range and the large
extinction. The equivalent widths (EWs) of DIBs were not correlated with the
column densities of C$_2$ molecules, which trace the patchy dense component,
suggesting that the NIR DIB carriers are distributed mainly in the diffuse

in Cyg OB2 and stars observed previously, $\lambda\lambda$10780, 10792, 11797,
12623, and 13175 are found to constitute a ""family"", in which the DIBs are
correlated well over the wide EW range. In contrast, the EW of $\lambda$10504

estimated from the average EW of $\lambda$10504 ($A_V\sim3.6$mag) roughly
corresponds to the lower limit of the extinction distribution of OB stars in
Cyg OB2. This suggests that $\lambda$10504 is absorbed only by the foreground
clouds, implying that the carrier of $\lambda$10504 is completely destroyed in

interpretation as an epistemic and representational practice that progressively
deepens students' computational modeling in science by valuing, rather than
deemphasizing, the subjective nature of the experience of modeling. We report
results from a study in which fourth grade children engaged in computational
modeling throughout the academic year. We present three salient themes that
characterize the development of students' disciplined interpretations in terms
of their development of computational modeling as a way of seeing and doing
science.

the complex relationship between several predictors and a response variable at
the small area level, in the presence of i) high correlation between the

highly correlated create collinearity problems when used in a standard multiple
regression model. Many methods have been proposed in the literature to address
this issue. A very common approach is to create an index which aggregates all
the highly correlated variables of interest. For example, it is well known that
there is a relationship between social deprivation measured through the
Multiple Deprivation Index (IMD) and air pollution; this index is then used as
a confounder in assessing the effect of air pollution on health outcomes (e.g.
respiratory hospital admissions or mortality). However it would be more
informative to look specifically at each domain of the IMD and at its
relationship with air pollution to better understand its role as a confounder
in the epidemiological analyses. In this paper we illustrate how the complex
relationships between the domains of IMD and air pollution can be deconstructed

structure sheds new light on the old debate on whether space and time are to be
seen as fundamental. Refraining from assuming space-time as given a priori has
a number of consequences. First, the usual definitions of randomness depend on
a causal structure and turn meaningless. So motivated, we propose an intrinsic,
physically motivated measure for the randomness of a string of bits: its length
minus its normalized work value, a quantity we closely relate to its Kolmogorov
complexity (the length of the shortest program making a universal Turing
machine output this string). We test this alternative concept of randomness for
the example of non-local correlations, and we end up with a reasoning that
leads to similar conclusions as in, but is conceptually more direct than, the
probabilistic view since only the outcomes of measurements that can actually
all be carried out together are put into relation to each other. In the same
context-free spirit, we connect the logical reversibility of an evolution to
the second law of thermodynamics and the arrow of time. Refining this, we end
up with a speculation on the emergence of a space-time structure on bit strings
in terms of data-compressibility relations. Finally, we show that logical
consistency, by which we replace the abandoned causality, it strictly weaker a
constraint than the latter in the multi-party case.

The complex orbital structure of the Kuiper belt, including several categories
of objects inside and outside of resonances with Neptune, emerged as a result
of Neptune's migration into an outer planetesimal disk. An outstanding problem
with the existing migration models is that they invariably predict excessively
large resonant populations, while observations show that the non-resonant
orbits are in fact common (e.g., the main belt population is 2-4 times larger
than Plutinos in the 3:2 resonance). Here we show that this problem can
resolved if it is assumed that Neptune's migration was grainy, as expected from
scattering encounters of Neptune with massive planetesimals. The grainy
migration acts to destabilize resonant bodies with large libration amplitudes,
a fraction of which ends up on stable non-resonant orbits. Thus, the
non-resonant--to--resonant ratio obtained with the grainy migration is higher,
up to ~10 times higher for the range of parameters investigated here, than in a
model with smooth migration. The grainy migration leads to a narrower
distribution of the libration amplitudes in the 3:2 resonance. The best fit to
observations is obtained when it is assumed that the outer planetesimal disk
below 30 AU contained 1000-4000 Plutos, or ~1000 bodies twice as massive as
Pluto. We find that the probability for an outer disk object to end up on a
stable orbit in the Kuiper belt is ~10^{-3}. Together, these results are
consistent with having only two (known) Pluto-mass bodies in the Kuiper belt
today (Pluto and Eris). The combined mass of Pluto-class objects in the
original disk was ~2-8 Earth masses (M_Earth), which represents 10-40% of the
estimated disk mass (M_disk ~ 20 M_Earth).

found in liquid crystal blue phases. The line locations are tunable via the NLC
elastic constants, the cell geometry, and the size and spacing of holes in the

propulsion of marine craft by propagating flexural waves are reported. Recent
experimental investigations of small model boats propelled by propagating
flexural waves carried out by the present author and his co-workers
demonstrated viability of this type of propulsion as an alternative to a
well-known screw propeller. In the attempts of theoretical explanation of the
obtained experimental results using the theory of Lighthill for fish
locomotion, it was found that this theory predicts zero thrust for such model
boats, which is in contradiction with the results of the experiments. One
should note in this connection that the theory developed by Lighthill assumes
that the amplitudes of propulsive waves created by fish body motion grow from
zero on the front (at fish heads) to their maximum values at the tails. This is
consistent with fish body motion in nature, but is not compatible with the
behaviour of localised flexural waves used for propulsion in the experimental
model vessels. To overcome the problem of predicting zero thrust for the above
vessels, it is suggested in the present work that nonlinear distortion of
localised flexural waves may be responsible for generation of thrust. This
hypothesis is explored in the present work by adding nonlinear harmonics of
propulsive flexural waves to the formula derived by Lighthill for generated
thrust. For simplicity, only the lowest (third) harmonic growing linearly with
the distance of propagation was used. The resulting formula for the averaged
thrust shows that, due to the effect of the third harmonic, the thrust is no
longer zero, thereby demonstrating that nonlinear distortion of the propulsive
flexural waves may be paramount for the existence of wave-like aquatic
propulsion of small marine craft using freely propagating flexural waves.

to the lack of exploiting historical dispatch records of VRG units. To bridge
this gap, this paper proposes a novel data-driven real-time dispatch approach
to maximize VRG utili-zation by using do-not-exceed (DNE) limits. This approach
defines the maximum generation output ranges that the system can ac-commodate

base points of conventional units are co-optimized by hybrid stochastic and
robust optimization, and the decision models are formulated as mixed-integer

proposed to capture the VRG uncertainty more accurately under variant

the proposed methods.

each, such that each region has $O(\sqrt{r})$ vertices (called boundary

complete graph containing all-pairs distances between its boundary nodes. A
dense distance graph of an $r$-division is the union of the $O(n/r)$ dense
distance graphs of the individual pieces. Since the introduction of dense
distance graphs by Fakcharoenphol and Rao, computing single-source shortest
paths in dense distance graphs has found numerous applications in fundamental
planar graph algorithms.
  Fakcharoenphol and Rao proposed an algorithm (later called FR-Dijkstra) for

exoplanet candidates using the transit method, including hundreds of stars with

valuable systems, it is essential to account for the unique geometric
probabilities of detecting multiple transiting extrasolar planets around the
same parent star. In order to improve on previous studies that used numerical
methods, we have constructed an efficient, semi-analytical algorithm called
CORBITS which, given a collection of conjectured exoplanets orbiting a star,
computes the probability that any particular group of exoplanets can be
observed to transit. The algorithm applies theorems of elementary differential
geometry to compute the areas bounded by circular curves on the surface of a
sphere (see Ragozzine & Holman 2010). The implemented algorithm is more
accurate and orders of magnitude faster than previous algorithms, based on
comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations. We use CORBITS to show that the
present solar system would only show a maximum of 3 transiting planets, but
that this varies over time due to dynamical evolution. We also used CORBITS to
geometrically debias the period ratio and mutual Hill sphere distributions of
Kepler's multi-transiting planet candidates, which results in shifting these
distributions towards slightly larger values. In an Appendix, we present
additional semi-analytical methods for determining the frequency of exoplanet
mutual events, i.e., the geometric probability that two planets will transit
each other (Planet-Planet Occultation, relevant to transiting circumbinary
planets) and the probability that this transit occurs simultaneously as they
transit their star. The CORBITS algorithms and several worked examples are

been proposed for sparse representation. The main purpose of this article is to
provide a comprehensive study and an updated review on sparse representation
and to supply a guidance for researchers. The taxonomy of sparse representation
methods can be studied from various viewpoints. For example, in terms of
different norm minimizations used in sparsity constraints, the methods can be
roughly categorized into five groups: sparse representation with $l_0$-norm
minimization, sparse representation with $l_p$-norm (0$<$p$<$1) minimization,
sparse representation with $l_1$-norm minimization and sparse representation
with $l_{2,1}$-norm minimization. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of
sparse representation is provided. The available sparse representation
algorithms can also be empirically categorized into four groups: greedy
strategy approximation, constrained optimization, proximity algorithm-based
optimization, and homotopy algorithm-based sparse representation. The
rationales of different algorithms in each category are analyzed and a wide
range of sparse representation applications are summarized, which could
sufficiently reveal the potential nature of the sparse representation theory.
Specifically, an experimentally comparative study of these sparse
representation algorithms was presented. The Matlab code used in this paper can

to the vast body of related literature, which considers fixed inter-element
spacing, we elaborate on a practical topology in which an increase in the
number of antennas in a fixed total space induces an inversely proportional
decrease in the inter-antenna distance. For this scenario, we derive exact and
approximate expressions, as well as simplified upper/lower bounds, for the SE
of maximum-ratio combining (MRC), zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean-squared
error receivers (MMSE) receivers. In particular, our analysis shows that the
MRC receiver is non-optimal for space-constrained massive MIMO topologies. On
the other hand, ZF and MMSE receivers can still deliver an increasing SE as the
number of BS antennas grows large. Numerical results corroborate our analysis
and show the effect of the number of antennas, the number of users, and the
total antenna array space on the sum SE performance.

square-shaped, doubly-resonant $LiNbO_3$ cavity with two flat and two convex
facets. When additional mild polishing is implemented, the Q-factor of the
resonator is found to be limited only by the material absorption loss. We show
how our monolithic square resonator may be operated as an optical parametric
oscillator that is evanescently coupled to free-space beams via birefringent
prisms. The prism arrangement allows for independent and large tuning of the
fundamental and second harmonic coupling rates. We measure $2.6\pm0.5$ dB of
vacuum squeezing at 1064 nm using our system. Potential improvements to obtain
higher degrees of squeezing are discussed.

reconnaissance but the framework demands a good switching strategy when
switching between multiple configurations for its web-stack. To address this

Bayesian game. We then formulate an optimization problem that generates an
effective switching strategy while considering the cost of switching between
different web-stack configurations. To incorporate this model into a developed
MTD system, we develop an automated system for generating attack sets of Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) for input attacker types with predefined
capabilities. Our framework obtains realistic reward values for the players
(defenders and attackers) in this game by using security domain expertise on
CVEs obtained from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). We also address
the issue of prioritizing vulnerabilities that when fixed, improves the
security of the MTD system. Lastly, we demonstrate the robustness of our
proposed model by evaluating its performance when there is uncertainty about

ideal place to probe the strength of annihilation contribution in hadronic
$B_{u,d,s}$ decays. In this paper, we study these kinds of decays in the
framework of QCD factorization, by adopting two different schemes: scheme I is
similar to the method usually adopted in the QCD factorization approach, while
scheme II is based on the infrared behavior of gluon propagator and running
coupling. For comparison, in our calculation, we adopt three kinds of wave
functions for $B_{c}$ meson. It is found that: (a) The predicted branching
ratios in scheme I are, however, quite small and are almost impossible to be
measured at the LHCb experiment. (b) In scheme II, by assigning a dynamical
gluon mass to the gluon propagator, we can avoid enhancements of the
contribution from soft endpoint region. The strength of annihilation
contributions predicted in scheme II is enhanced compared to that obtained in
scheme I. However, the predicted branching ratios are still smaller than the
corresponding ones obtained in the perturbative QCD approach. The large
discrepancies among these theoretical predictions indicate that more detailed
studies of these decays are urgently needed and will be tested by the future
measurements performed at the LHCb experiment.

are widely used in the study of biological systems. Many theoretical methods
are available for establishing existence and stability of steady states of
general evolution equations. However, except for very special cases, finding an
analytical form of stationary solutions for evolution equations is a
challenging task. In the present paper, we develop a numerical framework for
computing approximations to stationary solutions of general evolution
equations, which can also be used to produce existence and stability regions
for steady states. In particular, we use the Trotter-Kato Theorem to
approximate the infinitesimal generator of an evolution equation on a finite
dimensional space, which in turn reduces the evolution equation into a system
of ordinary differential equations. Consequently, we approximate and study the
asymptotic behavior of stationary solutions. We illustrate the convergence of
our numerical framework by applying it to a linear Sinko-Streifer structured
population model for which the exact form of the steady state is known. To
further illustrate the utility of our approach, we apply our framework to
nonlinear population balance equation, which is an extension of well-known
Smoluchowksi coagulation-fragmentation model to biological populations. We also
demonstrate that our numerical framework can be used to gain insight about the
theoretical stability of the stationary solutions of the evolution equations.

numerical simulations is freely available from our Github repository

on the problem of indirect influence: how some features might indirectly

contrasts our work with other methods that investigate feature influence like

diversity on link existence can vary substantially across networks. We find
that its positive effect on Facebook and negative effect on LinkedIn suggest
different underlying networking needs in these networks. We also discover
striking cases where diversity violates the principle of homophily---that is,
where fewer mutual connections may lead to a higher tendency to link with each
other. We then leverage structural diversity to develop a common neighborhood
signature (CNS), which we apply to a large set of networks to uncover unique
network superfamilies not discoverable by conventional methods. Our findings
shed light on the pursuit to understand the ways in which network structures

  Extrapolation",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  X-ray computed tomography (CT) is one of widely used diagnostic tools for
medical and dental tomographic imaging of the human body. However, the standard
filtered backprojection reconstruction method requires the complete knowledge
of the projection data. In the case of limited data, the inverse problem of CT
becomes more ill-posed, which makes the reconstructed image deteriorated by the
artifacts. In this paper, we consider two dimensional CT reconstruction using
the horizontally truncated projections. Over the decades, the numerous results
including the sparsity model based approach has enabled the reconstruction of
the image inside the region of interest (ROI) from the limited knowledge of the
data. However, unlike these existing methods, we try to reconstruct the entire
CT image from the limited knowledge of the sinogram via the tight frame
regularization and the simultaneous sinogram extrapolation. Our proposed model
shows more promising numerical simulation results compared with the existing
sparsity model based approach.

consequently when two vortices corresponding to non-commutative elements

chains into intervals that start when the chain enters into a subset A, then
sample another subset B far away from A and end when the chain again return to

far apart, almost independent of each other. A and B may be any subsets of the
state space that are far apart of each other and such that the movement between
the subsets is repeated several times in a long Markov chain. The expected
length of the intervals is used in a function that describes the mixing
properties of the chain and improves our understanding of Markov chains.
  The paper proves a theorem that gives a bound on the variance of the estimate
for {\pi}(A), the probability for A under the limiting density of the Markov
chain. This may be used to find the length of the Markov chain that is needed
to explore the state space sufficiently. It is shown that the length of the
periods between each time A is entered by the Markov chain, has a heavy tailed
distribution. This increases the upper bound for the variance of the estimate
{\pi}(A).
  The paper gives a general guideline on how to find the optimal scaling of
parameters in the Metropolis-Hastings simulation algorithm that implicit
determine the acceptance rate. We find examples where it is optimal to have a
much smaller acceptance rate than what is generally recommended in the
literature and also examples where the optimal acceptance rate vanishes in the

think systems and their interaction from the point of view of their
compositional behaviour.
  The obvious idea to base the composition of systems on the concept of
computable functions and their compositional behaviour leads to supersystem
formation by composing simple and recursive systems.
  But this approach does not allow to account adequately for systems that
interact with many other systems in a stateful and nondeterministic way, which
is why I introduce the concept of interactivity and cooperation. In order to
describe interactive systems satisfactorily, a balance is needed between the
representation of their relationship to all the other systems and what happens
within the systems. I thus introduce the complementary descriptions of external
interactions and internal coordination, both based on a role concept in the
sense of a projection of a system onto its interactions. It actually mirrors
the internal vs. external distinction initially introduced by the system model
and reflects the problem how systems are supposed to cooperate without melting
into a common supersystem.
  Components become systems, intended for (a given) composition and with the
notion of an interface we subsume all relevant information necessary for this
composition.
  I introduce the concept of decisions as an additional internal input alphabet
in order to determine nondeterministic interactions and thus fictitiously
assume a system function where we actually do not have the knowledge to do so.
Thus, the close relationship between protocols and games becomes obvious.
  Finally, I transfer the gained insights to the field of IT system
architecture and introduce the concept of the ""interaction oriented
architecture (IOA)"" for interactive systems with its three elements of roles,
coordination rules, and decisions.

7130, obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The CO line and
dust continuum fluxes detected in our ALMA observations are $1230\pm74$ Jy km
s$^{-1}$ and $814\pm52$ mJy, respectively, which account for 100% and 51% of
their total respective fluxes. We find that the CO(6-5) and dust emissions are
generally spatially correlated, but their brightest peaks show an offset of
$\sim$70 pc, suggesting that the gas and dust emissions may start decoupling at
this physical scale. The brightest peak of the CO(6-5) emission does not
spatially correspond to the radio continuum peak, which is likely dominated by
an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). This, together with our additional
quantitative analysis, suggests that the heating contribution of the AGN to the
CO(6-5) emission in NGC 7130 is negligible. The CO(6-5) and the
extinction-corrected Pa-$\alpha$ maps display striking differences, suggestive
of either a breakdown of the correlation between warm dense gas and star
formation at linear scales of $<$100 pc or a large uncertainty in our
extinction correction to the observed Pa-$\alpha$ image. Over a larger scale of
$\sim$2.1\,kpc, the double-lobed structure found in the CO(6-5) emission agrees
well with the dust lanes in the optical/near-infrared images.

offers the advantage to hide all technical issues related to the implementation
of the finite element method, allowing to easily implement various numerical
algorithms.Two robust and optimised numerical methods were implemented to
minimize the Gross-Pitaevskii energy: a steepest descent method based on
Sobolev gradients and a minimization algorithm based on the state-of-the-art
optimization library Ipopt. For both methods, mesh adaptivity strategies are
implemented to reduce the computational time and increase the local spatial
accuracy when vortices are present. Different run cases are made available for
2D and 3D configurations of Bose-Einstein condensates in rotation. An optional
graphical user interface is also provided, allowing to easily run predefined
cases or with user-defined parameter files. We also provide several
post-processing tools (like the identification of quantized vortices) that

order relation $<$ and a distance function $\rho$ satisfying a collection of
axioms including a set of compatibility conditions between the partial order
relation and the distance function. The distance function is defined only on a
subset of the product of the space with itself that contains the diagonal,
namely, $\rho(x,y)$ is defined if and only if $x<y$ or $x=y$. Distances between
pairs of distinct points in a triple $x,y,z$, whenever these distances are
defined, satisfy the so-called \emph{time inequality}, which is a reverse
triangle inequality $\rho(x,y)+\rho(y,z)\leq \rho(z,y)$. In the 1960s, Herbert
Busemann developed an axiomatic theory of timelike spaces and of locally
timelike spaces. His motivation comes from the geometry underlying the theory
of relativity, and he tried to adapt to this setting his geometric theory of
metric spaces, namely, his theory of $G$-spaces (geodesic spaces). The
classical example he considers is the $n$-dimensional Lorentzian space. Two
other interesting classes of examples of timelike spaces he introduced are the
timelike analogues of the Funk and Hilbert geometries. In this paper, we
investigate these two geometries, and in doing this, we introduce variants of
them, in particular the timelike relative Funk and Hilbert geometries, in the
Euclidean and spherical settings. We describe the Finsler infinitesimal
structure of each of these geometries (with an appropriate notion of Finsler
structure) and we display the interactions among the Euclidean and timelike
spherical geometries. In particular, we characterize the de Sitter geometry as
a special case of a timelike spherical Hilbert geometry. The final version of
this paper will appear in Differential Geometry and its Applications.

large range of Newtonian fluids driving transport, including air and water, we
determine the bulk transport cessation threshold $\Theta^r_t$ by extrapolating
the transport load as a function of the dimensionless fluid shear stress
(`Shields number') $\Theta$ to the vanishing transport limit. In this limit,
the simulated steady states of continuous transport can be described by simple
analytical model equations relating the average transport layer properties to
the law of the wall flow velocity profile. We use this model to calculate
$\Theta^r_t$ for arbitrary environments and derive a general Shields-like
threshold diagram in which a Stokes-like number replaces the particle Reynolds
number. Despite the simplicity of our hydrodynamic description, the predicted
cessation threshold, both from the simulations and analytical model,
quantitatively agrees with measurements for transport in air and viscous and
turbulent liquids despite not being fitted to these measurements. We interpret
the analytical model as a description of a continuous rebound motion of
transported particles and thus $\Theta^r_t$ as the minimal fluid shear stress
needed to compensate the average energy loss of transported particles during an
average rebound at the bed surface. This interpretation, supported by
simulations near $\Theta^r_t$, implies that entrainment mechanisms are needed
to sustain transport above $\Theta^r_t$. While entrainment by turbulent events
sustains intermittent transport, entrainment by particle-bed impacts sustains
continuous transport. Combining our interpretations with the critical energy
criterion for incipient motion by Valyrakis and coworkers, we put forward a new
conceptual picture of sediment transport intermittency.

Here, we show instead how such intrinsic noise enhances information transfer in
the presence of multiple circuit copies. The result is due to the contribution
of noise to the generation of autonomous responses by each copy, which are
altogether associated with a common decision. Moreover, factors that correlate
the responses of the redundant units (extrinsic noise or regulatory cross-talk)
contribute to reduce fidelity, while those that further uncouple them
(heterogeneity within the copies) can lead to stronger information gain.
Overall, our study emphasizes how the interplay of signal thresholding,
redundancy, and noise influences the accuracy of cellular decision making.
Understanding this interplay provides a basis to explain collective cell

  figures, 8.6 Mb) in french",,,,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assays (ELISA) are a range of widely used
analytical methods whose implementation requires to build antibodies (IgG) thin
films onto surfaces predominantly made of polystyrene. The high hydrophobicity
of polystyrene ensures a spontaneous and strong adhesion of proteins allowing
to easily build IgG monolayers. Since the ELISA improvements definitely lie in
the comprehension of physico-chemical mechanisms on which IgG immobilization on
hydrophobic surfaces are relied, this work develops a theorization essay
(thermodynamics of the so-called hydrophobic effect and of thin films building)
emphasized by numerical modelling (random sequential additions model, i.e. RSA)
and experimental estimations by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ELISA.
Keeping in mind the hydrophobic effect, thermodynamics (of irreversible
processes) allows to explain why IgG adhesion on polystyrene occurs whereas
numerical modelling approaches show a way of surface saturation leading to
promote IgG orientations expected for ELISA. Finally, an improvement of RSA in
a RSA+R model taking into account orientational and/or structural changes
throughout relaxation phenomena shows an obvious relationship between
deposition conditions and obtained monolayer structure. Such theoretical
results seem to be strongly correlated with experimental facts, i.e. AFM and
ELISA.

particular, very large SiC grains can survive cosmic-ray exposure time.
However, most presolar SiC grains show residence times significantly shorter

shattering in destroying VLGs, or that VLGs have larger velocity dispersions

objects. There is a relative paucity of brown dwarfs companions around FGKM
stars compared to exoplanets for orbital periods less than a few years, but
most of the short-period brown dwarf companions fully characterised by transits
and radial velocities are found around F-type stars. We examine the hypothesis
that brown dwarf companions could not survive on close orbit around stars with
important convective envelopes because the tides and angular momentum loss
through magnetic breaking should lead to a rapid orbital decay and quick
engulfment of the companion. We use a classical Skumanich-type braking law, and
constant time-lag tidal theory to assess the characteristic timescale for
orbital decay for the brown dwarf mass range as a function of the host
properties. We find that F-type stars may host massive companions for a
significantly longer time than G-type stars for a given orbital period, which
may explain the paucity of G-type hosts for brown dwarfs with orbital period
less than 5 days. On the other hand, we show that the small radius of early
M-type stars contributes to orbital decay timescales that are only half those
of F-type stars, despite their more efficient tidal dissipation and magnetic
braking. For fully convective later type M-dwarfs, orbital decay timescales
could be orders of magnitude greater than for F-type stars. For orbital periods
greater than 10 days, brown dwarf occurrence should largely be unaffected by
tidal decay, whatever the mass of the host. On closer orbital periods, the
rapid engulfment of massive companions could explain the lack of G and K-type
hosts in the sample of known systems with transiting brown dwarfs. However, the
paucity of M-type hosts can not be an effect of tidal decay alone, but may be
the result of a selection effect in the sample and/or the formation mechanism.

statistical testing of hypotheses regarding the fine-grained spatial profile of
functional connectivity and whether that profile is different between subjects

confinement and the collective modes due to long-range correlations. We show
that, as in bulk, the confined fluid has structural, diffusion and density
anomalies, that order in the water-like hierarchy, and a liquid-liquid critical
point (LLCP). The overall anomalous region moves to higher temperatures,
densities and pressure and the LLCP displaces to higher temperature compared to

asserting that every real is computable from a Martin-L\""of random real. If the
computation of the first $n$ bits of a sequence requires $n+h(n)$ bits of the
random oracle, then $h$ is the redundancy of the computation. Ku\v{c}era
implicitly achieved redundancy $n\log n$ while G\'acs used a more elaborate
coding procedure which achieves redundancy $\sqrt{n}\log n$. A similar upper
bound is implicit in the later proof by Merkle and Mihailovi\'c. In this paper
we obtain strict optimal lower bounds on the redundancy in computations from
Martin-L\""of random oracles. We show that any nondecreasing computable function
$g$ such that $\sum_n 2^{-g(n)}=\infty$ is not a general upper bound on the
redundancy in computations from Martin-L\""of random oracles. In fact, there
exists a real $X$ such that the redundancy $g$ of any computation of $X$ from a
Martin-L\""of random oracle satisfies $\sum_n 2^{-g(n)}<\infty$. Moreover, the
class of such reals is comeager and includes a $\Delta^0_2$ real as well as all
weakly 2-generic reals. This excludes many slow growing functions such as $\log
n$ from bounding the redundancy in computations from random oracles for a large
class of reals. On the other hand it was recently shown that if $\sum_n

computations of any real from some Martin-L\""of random oracle. Our results are
obtained as an application of a theory of effective betting strategies with

often characterized by high frequencies of short loops. We present here a
theoretical framework able to overcome such a limitation for the case of site
percolation. Our method is based on a message passing algorithm that discounts
redundant paths along triangles in the graph. We systematically test the
approach on 98 real-world graphs and on synthetic networks. We find excellent
accuracy in the prediction of the whole percolation diagram, with significant
improvement with respect to the prediction obtained under the locally tree-like
approximation. Residual discrepancies between theory and simulations do not
depend on clustering and can be attributed to the presence of loops longer than
three edges. We present also a method to account for clustering in bond
percolation, but the improvement with respect to the method based on the
tree-like approximation is much less apparent.

which gradually leads to the virialization of the infalling gas in the

strategy to reduce turbulent fluctuations, and therefore skin-friction drag, in

guarantees in the nonlinear turbulent regime. The novel strategy is effective
in reducing the supply of available energy to feed the turbulent fluctuations,
expressed as reducing a bound on the supply rate to a quadratic storage
function. The nonlinearity present in the equations that govern the dynamics of
the flow is known to be passive and can be considered as a feedback forcing to
the linearised dynamics (a Lur'e decomposition). Therefore, one is only
required to control the linear dynamics in order to make the system close to
passive. The ten most energy-producing spatial modes of a turbulent channel
flow were identified. Passivity-based controllers were then generated to
control these modes. The controllers require measurements of streamwise and
spanwise wall-shear stress, and they actuate via wall transpiration. Nonlinear
direct numerical simulations demonstrated that these controllers were capable
of significantly reducing the turbulent energy and skin-friction drag of the

amplitude perturbation in the form of a vortex with its axis parallel to the
axis of the pipe. At sufficiently high Reynolds numbers the recirculation
region breaks into a turbulent patch that changes position axially depending on
the strength of the perturbation. This vortex perturbation is believed to
produce a less abrupt transition than in previous studies with a tilt
perturbation, as the localized turbulence is observed via the formation of a
wavy structure at a low order azimuthal mode, which resembles an optimally
amplified perturbation. For higher amplitude, the localized turbulence remains
at a constant axial position. It is further investigated using proper

pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV is presented, using data corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 19.6 inverse femtobarns collected with the CMS
detector at the LHC. This measurement is based on the observation of events
with large missing energy and with a single photon with transverse momentum
above 145 GeV and absolute pseudorapidity in the range |eta| < 1.44. The
measured Z gamma to nu nu-bar gamma production cross section, 52.7 +/-
2.1(stat) +/- 6.4 (syst) +/- 1.4 (lumi) fb, agrees well with the standard model
prediction of 50.0 +2.4 -2.2 fb. A study of the photon transverse momentum
spectrum yields the most stringent limits to date on the anomalous Z-Z-gamma
and Z-gamma-gamma trilinear gauge boson couplings.

search and identify solar system objects serendipitously observed by Kepler.
The SkyBoT service hosted at IMCCE provides a Virtual Observatory (VO)
compliant cone-search that lists all solar system objects present within a
field of view at a given epoch. To generate such a list in a timely manner,
ephemerides are pre-computed, updated weekly, and stored in a relational
database to ensure a fast access. The SkyBoT Web service can now be used with
Kepler. Solar system objects within a small (few arcminutes) field of view are
identified and listed in less than 10 sec. Generating object data for the
entire K2 field of view (14{\deg}) takes about a minute. This extension of the
SkyBot service opens new possibilities with respect to mining K2 data for solar
system science, as well as removing solar system objects from stellar
photometric time-series.

random bits, deterministic online algorithms with advice have access to a
sequence of advice bits, i.e., bits that are set by an all powerful oracle
prior to the processing of the request sequence. Advice bits are at least as
helpful as random bits, but how helpful are they? In this work, we investigate
the power of advice bits and random bits for online maximum bipartite matching
(MBM).
  The well-known Karp-Vazirani-Vazirani algorithm is an optimal randomized
$(1-\frac{1}{e})$-competitive algorithm for \textsc{MBM} that requires access
to $\Theta(n \log n)$ uniform random bits. We show that
$\Omega(\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}) n)$ advice bits are necessary and
$O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^5} n)$ sufficient in order to obtain a
$(1-\epsilon)$-competitive deterministic advice algorithm. Furthermore, for a
large natural class of deterministic advice algorithms, we prove that
$\Omega(\log \log \log n)$ advice bits are required in order to improve on the
$\frac{1}{2}$-competitiveness of the best deterministic online algorithm, while
it is known that $O(\log n)$ bits are sufficient.
  Last, we give a randomized online algorithm that uses $c n$ random bits, for
integers $c \ge 1$, and a competitive ratio that approaches $1-\frac{1}{e}$
very quickly as $c$ is increasing. For example if $c = 10$, then the difference
between $1-\frac{1}{e}$ and the achieved competitive ratio is less than
$0.0002$.

studied using hydrodynamic theories. Their predictions are then expected to be
valid for currents which scale inversely with the system size. To study this
question in detail, we introduce a class of large-N models of one-dimensional
boundary-driven diffusive systems, whose current large deviation functions are
exactly derivable for any finite number of sites. Surprisingly, we find that
for some systems the predictions of the hydrodynamic theory may hold well
beyond their naive regime of validity. Specifically, we show that, while a
symmetric partial exclusion process exhibits non-hydrodynamic behaviors
sufficiently far beyond the naive hydrodynamic regime, a symmetric inclusion
process is well described by the hydrodynamic theory for arbitrarily large
currents. We conjecture, and verify for zero-range processes, that the
hydrodynamic theory captures the statistics of arbitrarily large currents for
all models where the mobility coefficient as a function of density is unbounded
from above. In addition, for the large-N models, we prove the additivity
principle under the assumption that the large deviation function has no
discontinuous transitions.

of the path receive the same color. For a connected graph $G$, the proper
connection number $pc(G)$ of $G$ is defined as the minimum number of colors
needed to color its edges so that every pair of distinct vertices of $G$ are
connected by at least one proper path in $G$. In this paper, we consider two
conjectures on the proper connection number of graphs. The first conjecture
states that if $G$ is a noncomplete graph with connectivity $\kappa(G) = 2$ and
minimum degree $\delta(G)\ge 3$, then $pc(G) = 2$, posed by Borozan et al.~in
[Discrete Math. 312(2012), 2550-2560]. We give a family of counterexamples to
disprove this conjecture. However, from a result of Thomassen it follows that
3-edge-connected noncomplete graphs have proper connection number 2. Using this
result, we can prove that if $G$ is a 2-connected noncomplete graph with
$diam(G)=3$, then $pc(G) = 2$, which solves the second conjecture we want to

orbits around a massive object at the common center of the discs. The mass in
both discs is assumed to be much smaller than the mass of the central object.
For each disc, the disc particles are assumed to be in near circular orbits.
The two discs are coupled to each other gravitationally. The perturbed dynamics
of the discs evolves on the order of the precession time scale of the discs,
which is much longer than the Keplerian time scale. We present results for the
azimuthal wave number $m=1$ and $m=2$, for the full range of disc mass ratio
between the prograde and retrograde discs. The eigenspectra are in general
complex, therefore all eigenmodes are unstable. Eigenfunctions are radially
more compact for $m = 1$ as compared to $m = 2$. Pattern speed of eigenmodes is
always prograde with respect to the more massive disc. The growth rate of
unstable modes increases with increasing mass fraction in the retrograde disc,
and decreases with $m$; therefore $m=1$ instability is likely to play the
dominant role in the dynamics of such systems.

high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy may produce solutions with large dwell time
variations within catheters, which may result in undesirable selective
high-dose subvolumes. Extending the optimisation model with a dwell time
modulation restriction (DTMR) that limits dwell time differences between
neighboring dwell positions has been suggested to eliminate this issue. DTMRs
may additionally reduce the sensitivity for uncertainties in dwell positions
that result from catheter reconstruction errors and source positioning
inaccuracies. This study quantifies the reduction of high-dose subvolumes and
the robustness against these uncertainties by applying a DTMR to template-based
prostate HDR brachytherapy implants.
  Three different DTMRs were consecutively applied to a linear dose-based
penalty model (LD) and a dose-volume based model (LDV), both obtained from
literature. The models were solved with DTMR levels ranging from no restriction
to uniform dwell times within catheters. Uncertainties were simulated on
clinical cases using in-house developed software, and dose-volume metrics were
calculated in each simulation. For the assessment of high-dose subvolumes, the
dose homogeneity index (DHI) and the contiguous dose volume histogram were
analysed. Robustness was measured by the improvement of the lowest $D_{90\%}$
of the planning target volume (PTV) observed in the simulations.
  For (LD), a DTMR yields an increase in DHI of 30% and reduces the size of the
largest high-dose volume by 2 to 5 cc. This came at a cost of a reduction in
$D_{90\%}$ of the PTV of 10%, which often implies that it drops below the
desired minimum of 100%. For (LDV), none of the DTMRs improved high-dose volume
measures. DTMRs were not capable of improving robustness of PTV $D_{90\%}$
against uncertainty in dwell positions for both models.

molecular clouds. Recent evidence, both observational and numerical, suggests
that molecular clouds (MCs) may be undergoing global, hierarchical
gravitational collapse. The ""hierarchical"" regime consists of small-scale
collapses within larger-scale ones. The latter implies that the star formation
rate increases systematically during the early stages of evolution, and occurs
via filamentary flows onto ""hubs"" of higher density, mass, and velocity
dispersion, and culminates a few Myr after than the small-scale collapses have
started to form stars. In turn, the small-scale collapses occur in clumps
embedded in the filaments, and are themselves falling into the larger potential
well of the still-ongoing large-scale collapse. The stars formed in the early,
small-scale collapses share the infall motion of their parent clumps towards
the larger potential trough, so that the filaments feed both gaseous and
stellar material to the hubs. This leads to the presence of older stars in a
region where new protostars are still forming, to a scale-free or fractal
structure of the clusters, in which each unit is composed of smaller-scale
ones, and to the eventual merging of the subunits, explaining the observed
structural features of open clusters.

these two-dimensional fluids. Inspired by proteins that generate membrane
curvature, sense the underlying membrane geometry, and migrate to high
curvature sites, we explore the question: Can colloids, adhered to lipid
bilayers, also sense and respond to membrane geometry? We report the curvature
migration of Janus microparticles adhered to giant unilamellar vesicles
elongated to present well defined curvature fields. However, unlike proteins,
which migrate to minimize membrane bending energy, colloids migrate by an
entirely different mechanism. By determining the energy dissipated along a
trajectory, the energy field mediating these interactions is inferred to be
linear in the local deviatoric curvature, as reported previously for colloids
trapped at curved interfaces between immiscible fluids. In this latter system,
however, the energy gradients are far larger, so particles move
deterministically, whereas the colloids on vesicles move with significant
fluctuations in regions of weak curvature gradient. By addressing the role of
Brownian motion, we show that the observed curvature migration of colloids on
bilayers is indeed a case of curvature capillary migration, with membrane
tension playing the role of interfacial tension. Furthermore, since this motion
is mediated by membrane tension and shape, it can be modulated, or even turned
""on"" and ""off"", by simply varying these parameters. While particle-particle
interactions on lipid membranes have been considered in many contributions, we
report here an exciting and previously unexplored modality to actively direct
the migration of colloids to desired locations on lipid bilayers.

biochemistry providing information on size, shape, and interactions of
macromolecules from the analysis of their migration in centrifugal fields while
free in solution. A key mechanical element in AUC is the centerpiece, a
component of the sample cell assembly that is mounted between the optical
windows to allow imaging and to seal the sample solution column against high
vacuum while exposed to gravitational forces in excess of 300,000 g. For
sedimentation velocity it needs to be precisely sector-shaped to allow
unimpeded radial macromolecular migration. During the history of AUC a great
variety of centerpiece designs have been developed for different types of
experiments. Here, we report that centerpieces can now be readily fabricated by
3D printing at low cost, from a variety of materials, and with customized
designs. The new centerpieces can exhibit sufficient mechanical stability to
withstand the gravitational forces at the highest rotor speeds and be
sufficiently precise for sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity
experiments. Sedimentation velocity experiments with bovine serum albumin as a
reference molecule in 3D printed centerpieces with standard double-sector
design result in sedimentation boundaries virtually indistinguishable from
those in commercial double-sector epoxy centerpieces, with sedimentation
coefficients well within the range of published values. The statistical error
of the measurement is slightly above that obtained with commercial epoxy, but
still below 1%. Facilitated by modern open-source design and fabrication
paradigms, we believe 3D printed centerpieces and AUC accessories can spawn a
variety of improvements in AUC experimental design, efficiency and resource

our Response article (Tanley et al 2015) to the Critique article of Shabalin et

interpretations of electron density in 4xan and removal of an organic moiety as
a ligand to the platinum ion coordinated to His15. We note Shabalin et al
(2015) model of a chlorine in that density and a close by bromine at partial
occupancy to explain the shape. However, as the bromide concentration is in
huge excess over chloride (by 20 fold), we think that the 4yem Shabalin et al
2015 interpretation highly unlikely, but nevertheless we still cannot offer an
explanation for that shape, confirming our earlier analysis described in Tanley
et al (2014). Following Shabalin et al (2015) reprocessing of the raw
diffraction data for 4g4a, we also redid the diffraction data processing for
4xan to a higher resolution using EVAL (Schreurs et al 2010) concluding in
favour of 1.3 Angstrom as the resolution limit and which is the basis for our
revised PDB file for 4xan (5HMJ). It is very interesting that there is extra
X-ray diffraction data from 1.47 to 1.30 Angstrom resolution e.g. with
<I/sigma(I)> =0.39 and CC1/2 = 0.181 in the final shell (1.30 to 1.322

our statement of approach in our Response article (Tanley et al 2015). Our
critical re-examination includes comparisons based on the 4xan diffraction data
images reprocessing with three different software packages so as to evaluate
the possibility of variations in electron density interpretations due to that.

Since the nature and cause of the cosmic acceleration are still unknown,
model-independent approaches to study the evolution of the universe are
welcome. One of the powerful model-independent approaches is the so-called
cosmography. It only relies on the cosmological principle, without postulating
any underlying theoretical model. However, there are several shortcomings in
the usual cosmography. For instance, it is plagued with the problem of
divergence (or an unacceptably large error), and it fails to predict the future
evolution of the universe. In the present work, we try to overcome or at least
alleviate these problems, and we propose two new generalizations of cosmography
inspired by the Pad\'e approximant. One is to directly parameterize the
luminosity distance based on the Pad\'e approximant, while the other is to
generalize cosmography with respect to a so-called $y_\beta$-shift
$y_\beta=z/(1+\beta z)$, which is also inspired by the Pad\'e approximant.

with limited storage and service capacities located near the end-users.
Appropriate replication of content on the front-end servers is key to maximize
the fraction of requests served by the front-end servers. Motivated by this, a
multiple cache variant of the classical single cache paging problem is studied,
which is referred to as the Multiple Cache Paging (MCP) problem. In each
time-slot, a batch of content requests arrive that have to be served by a bank
of caches, and each cache can serve exactly one request. If a content is not
found in the bank, it is fetched from the back-end server, and one currently
stored content is ejected, and counted as fault. As in the classical paging
problem, the goal is to minimize the total number of faults. The competitive
ratio of any online algorithm for the MCP problem is shown to be unbounded for
arbitrary input, thus concluding that the MCP problem is fundamentally
different from the classical paging problem. Consequently, stochastic arrivals
setting is considered, where requests arrive according to a known/unknown
stochastic process. It is shown that near optimal performance can be achieved
with simple policies that require no co-ordination across the caches.

system depends on both the initial state and the channel responsible for the
evolution. An extreme case is that of entanglement braking channels, which are
channels that acting on only one of the subsystems drives them to full
disentanglement regardless of the initial state. In general, one can find
certain combinations of initial states and channels acting on one or both
subsystems that can result in entanglement sudden death or not. Neither the
channel nor the initial state, but their combination, is responsible for this
effect, but their combination. In this work we show that, in all cases, when
entanglement sudden death occurs, the evolution can be mapped to that of an
effective entanglement breaking channel on a modified initial state. Our
results allow to anticipate which states will suffer entanglement sudden death
or not for a given evolution. An experiment with polarization entangled photons
demonstrates the utility of this result in a variety of cases.

model losses of nonlinear waves. This term amounts to a time convolution
product, which greatly penalizes the numerical modeling. A diffusive
representation of the fractional derivative is adopted here, replacing this
nonlocal operator by a continuum of memory variables that satisfy local-in-time
ordinary differential equations. Then a quadrature formula yields a system of
local partial differential equations, well-suited to numerical integration. The
determination of the quadrature coefficients is crucial to ensure both the
well-posedness of the system and the computational efficiency of the diffusive
approximation. For this purpose, optimization with constraint is shown to be a
very efficient strategy. Strang splitting is used to solve successively the
hyperbolic part by a shock-capturing scheme, and the diffusive part exactly.
Numerical experiments are proposed to assess the efficiency of the numerical
modeling, and to illustrate the effect of the fractional attenuation on the
wave propagation.

isomorphism between subtrees of two given input trees. This problem is a
natural restriction of the maximum common subgraph problem, which is ${\sf
NP}$-hard in general graphs. Confining to trees renders polynomial time
algorithms possible and is of fundamental importance for approaches on more
general graph classes. Various variants of this problem in trees have been
intensively studied. We consider the general case, where trees are neither
rooted nor ordered and the isomorphism is maximum w.r.t. a weight function on
the mapped vertices and edges. For trees of order $n$ and maximum degree
$\Delta$ our algorithm achieves a running time of $\mathcal{O}(n^2\Delta)$ by
exploiting the structure of the matching instances arising as subproblems. Thus
our algorithm outperforms the best previously known approaches. No faster
algorithm is possible for trees of bounded degree and for trees of unbounded
degree we show that a further reduction of the running time would directly
improve the best known approach to the assignment problem. Combining a
polynomial-delay algorithm for the enumeration of all maximum common subtree
isomorphisms with central ideas of our new algorithm leads to an improvement of
its running time from $\mathcal{O}(n^6+Tn^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^3+Tn\Delta)$,
where $n$ is the order of the larger tree, $T$ is the number of different
solutions, and $\Delta$ is the minimum of the maximum degrees of the input
trees. Our theoretical results are supplemented by an experimental evaluation
on synthetic and real-world instances.

importantly contribute to the observed power spectrum of magnetic fluctuations
around ion scales; AIC waves contribute to the spectrum in a narrow frequency
range whereas the coherent structures contribute to the spectrum over a wide
frequency band from the inertial range to the sub-ion frequency range. We
conclude that a particular combination of waves and coherent structures

or growing exponentially with time. Whenever two such modes coalesce both in
their resonant frequency and their rate of decay or growth, a so-called
""exceptional point"" occurs, around which many fascinating phenomena have
recently been reported to arise. Particularly intriguing behavior is predicted
to appear when encircling an exceptional point sufficiently slowly, like a
state-flip or the accumulation of a geometric phase. Experiments dedicated to
this issue could already successfully explore the topological structure of
exceptional points, but a full dynamical encircling and the breakdown of
adiabaticity inevitably associated with it remained out of reach of any
measurement so far. Here we demonstrate that a dynamical encircling of an
exceptional point can be mapped onto the problem of scattering through a
two-mode waveguide, which allows us for the first time to access the elusive
effects occurring in this context. Specifically, we present experimental
results from a waveguide structure that steers incoming waves around an
exceptional point during the transmission process. In this way mode transitions
are induced that make this device perfectly suited as a robust and asymmetric
switch between different waveguide modes. Our work opens up new and exciting
avenues to explore exceptional point physics at the crossroads between
fundamental research and practical applications.

algebraic geometry and number theory, in a situation where dialogue between
practitioners has revealed rich structure. It contains a theorem and 7
conjectures, tested deeply by 3 optimized algorithms, on relations between
Feynman integrals and L-series defined by products, over the primes, of data
determined by moments of Kloosterman sums in finite fields. There is an
extended introduction, for readers who may not be familiar with all three of
these subjects. Notable new results include conjectural evaluations of
non-critical L-series of modular forms of weights 3, 4 and 6, by determinants
of Feynman integrals, an evaluation for the weight 5 problem, at a critical
integer, and formulas for determinants of arbitrary size, tested up to 30
loops. It is shown that the functional equation for Kloosterman moments
determines much but not all of the structure of the L-series. In particular,
for problems with odd numbers of Bessel functions, it misses a crucial feature
captured in this work by novel and intensively tested conjectures. For the
9-Bessel problem, these lead to an astounding compression of data at the
primes.

there is no change except eternal spherical motion, below are two different
kinds of motion: Natural motion (without specific cause) and enforced motion.
In modern view motion is caused by gravity and by other forces. The split at
the sphere of the moon has been definitely overcome through the observation of
a supernova and several comets by Tycho Brahe. The second distinction was
eradicated by Isaak Newton who showed that gravitational motion was caused by a
force proportional to the inverse square of the distance. By the theory of
General Relativity, Albert Einstein showed that there is no gravitational force
but motion under gravity (i.e. Aristotles <natural motion>) is caused by the
curved geometry of spacetime. In this way, the Aristotelian distinction between
natural motion and enforced motion has come back in the form of two great
theories: General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory which are today
incompatible. To find a way out of this dilemma is the challenge of modern
physics.

considers an appropriate deformation of Maxwell-Boltzmann form with inverse
temperature $\beta$, in particular, a power-law truncation at the scape energy
$\varepsilon_{s}$ with exponent $\gamma>0$. This deformation is implemented
using a generalized $\gamma$-exponential function obtained from the

this proposal generalizes models of tidal stellar systems that predict
particles distributions with \emph{isothermal cores and polytropic haloes},

consequence of this study is that profiles with isothermal cores and polytropic
