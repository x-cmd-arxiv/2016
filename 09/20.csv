years. In this paper we introduce a new type-II progressive censoring scheme
for two samples. It is observed that the proposed censoring scheme is
analytically more tractable than the existing joint progressive type-II
censoring scheme proposed by Rasouli and Balakrishnan \cite{RB:2010}. It has
some other advantages also. We study the statistical inference of the unknown
parameters based on the assumptions that the lifetime distribution of the
experimental units for the two samples follow exponential distribution with
different scale parameters. The maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown
parameters are obtained and their exact distributions are derived. Based on the
exact distributions of the maximum likelihood estimators exact confidence
intervals are also constructed. For comparison purposes we have used bootstrap
confidence intervals also. It is observed that the bootstrap confidence
intervals work very well and they are very easy to implement in practice. Some
simulation experiments are performed to compare the performances of the
proposed method with the existing one, and the performances of the proposed
method are quite satisfactory. One data analysis has been performed for
illustrative purposes. Finally we propose some open problems.

High Synchrotron Peaked blazars (HSPs) dominate the -ray sky at
energies larger than a few GeV; however, only a few hundred blazars of this
type have been catalogued so far. In this paper we present the 2WHSP sample,
the largest and most complete list of HSP blazars available to date, which is
an expansion of the 1WHSP catalog of gamma-ray source candidates off the
Galactic plane.
  Methods. We cross-matched a number of multi-wavelength surveys (in the radio,
infrared and X-ray bands) and applied selection criteria based on the radio to
IR and IR to X-ray spectral slopes. To ensure the selection of genuine HSPs we
examined the SED of each candidate and estimated the peak frequency of its
synchrotron emission ($\nu_{\rm peak}$) using the ASDC SED tool, including only
sources with Synchrotron peak $\nu_{\rm peak} > 10^{15}$ Hz (equivalent to
$\nu_{\rm peak} > 4$ eV).
  Results. We have assembled the largest and most complete catalog of HSP
blazars to date, which includes 1691 sources. A number of population
properties, such as infrared colours, synchrotron peak, redshift distributions,
and -ray spectral properties, have been used to characterise the sample and
maximize completeness. We also derived the radio logN-logS distribution. This
catalog has already been used to provide seeds to discover new very high energy
objects within Fermi-LAT data and to look for the counterparts of neutrino and
ultra high energy cosmic ray sources, showing its potential for the
identification of promising high-energy gamma-ray sources and multi-messenger
targets.

the spanning trees and spanning 2-forests of the graph, respectively.
  In a previous paper with Bloch, Burgos and Fres\'an, we related this ratio to
the asymptotic of the Archimedean height pairing between degree zero divisors
on degenerating families of Riemann surfaces. Motivated by this, we consider in
this paper the variation of the ratio of the two Symanzik polynomials under
bounded perturbations of the geometry of the graph. This is a natural problem
in connection with the theory of nilpotent and SL2 orbits in Hodge theory.
  Our main result is the boundedness of variation of the ratio. For this we
define the exchange graph of a given graph which encodes the exchange
properties between spanning trees and spanning 2-forests in the graph. We
provide a description of the connected components of this graph, and use this

independently evaluate, execute, and achieve goals while respecting surrounding
rules, laws, or conventions. In doing so, an APS must rely on a broad spectrum
of dynamic, complex, and often imprecise information about its surroundings,
the task it is to perform, and its own sensors and actuators. For example,
cleaning in a home or commercial setting requires the ability to perceive,
grasp, and manipulate many physical objects, the ability to reliably perform a
variety of subtasks such as washing, folding, and stacking, and knowledge about
local conventions such as how objects are classified and where they should be
stored. The information required for reliable autonomous operation may come
from external sources and from the robot's own sensor observations or in the
form of direct instruction by a trainer. Similar considerations apply across
many domains - construction, manufacturing, in-home assistance, and healthcare.
For example, surgeons spend many years learning about physiology and anatomy
before they touch a patient. They then perform roughly 1000 surgeries under the
tutelage of an expert surgeon, and they practice basic maneuvers such as suture
tying thousands of times outside the operating room. All of these elements come
together to achieve expertise at this task. Endowing a system with robust
autonomy by traditional programming methods has thus far had limited success.
Several promising new paths to acquiring and processing such data are emerging.
This white paper outlines three promising research directions for enabling an
APS to learn the physical and information skills necessary to perform tasks
with independence and flexibility: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Human-Robot
Interaction, and Cloud Robotics.

paper makes progress towards efficient computation by focusing on a concrete

to optimize quadratic functions over hypercubes. Starting with a first guess
computed via a spectral method, the algorithm successively refines the iterates

converges to the maximum likelihood estimate---in a suitable regime. Numerical

perturbation in absorbing phase transitions for all dimensions. However, its
effect for systems other than the standard contact process (CP), its
competition with other ingredients (e.g. particle diffusion) and other kinds of
disorder (besides the standard types) are unknown. In order to shed some light
in the above mentioned points, we investigate a variant of the usual CP, namely
triplet annihilation model (TAM), in which the competition between triplet
annihilation and single particle diffusion leads to an unusual phase diagram
behavior, with reentrant shape and endless activity for sufficient large
diffusion rates. Two kinds of time-dependent disorder have been considered. In
the former, it is introduced in the creation-annihilation parameters (as
commonly considered in recent studies), whereas in the latter the diffusion
rate $D$ (so far unexplored) is allowed to be time dependent. In all cases, the
disorder follows an uniform distribution with fixed mean and width $\sigma$.
Two values of $\sigma$ have been considered, in order to exemplify the regime
of ""weaker"" and ""stronger"" temporal disorder strengths. Our results show that
in the former approach, the disorder suppresses the reentrant phase diagram
with a critical behavior deviating from the directed percolation universality
class (DP) in the regime of low diffusion rates, while they strongly suggest
that the DP class is recovered for larger hoping rates. An opposite scenario is
found in the latter disorder approach, with a substantial increase of reentrant
shape and the maximum diffusion, in which the reentrant shape also displays a
critical behavior consistent to the DP universality class (in similarity with
the pure model). Lastly, comparison with the diffusive disordered CP has been
undertaken.

we study the modification of the angular distribution of the energy within jets
in heavy ion collisions, as partons within jet showers lose energy and get
kicked as they traverse the strongly coupled plasma produced in the collision.
To describe the dynamics transverse to the jet axis, we add the effects of
transverse momentum broadening into our hybrid construction, introducing a
parameter $K\equiv \hat q/T^3$ that governs its magnitude. We show that,
because of the quenching of the energy of partons within a jet, even when
$K\neq 0$ the jets that survive with some specified energy in the final state
are narrower than jets with that energy in proton-proton collisions. For this
reason, many standard observables are rather insensitive to $K$. We propose a
new differential jet shape ratio observable in which the effects of transverse
momentum broadening are apparent. We also analyze the response of the medium to
the passage of the jet through it, noting that the momentum lost by the jet
appears as the momentum of a wake in the medium. After freezeout this wake
becomes soft particles with a broad angular distribution but with net momentum
in the jet direction. We show that the particles coming from the response of
the medium to the momentum and energy deposited in it leads to a correlation
between the momentum of soft particles well separated from the jet in angle
with the direction of the jet momentum, and find qualitative but not
quantitative agreement with experimental data on observables designed to
extract such a correlation. By confronting the results that we obtain upon
introducing transverse momentum broadening and the response of the medium to
the jet with available jet data, we highlight the importance of these processes
for understanding the internal, soft, angular structure of high energy jets.

known brown dwarf ($\sim250$ K) and one of the Sun's closest neighbors (2.2
pc), it offers a unique opportunity for studying a planet-like atmosphere in an
unexplored regime of temperature. To detect and characterize inhomogeneities in
its atmosphere (e.g., patchy clouds, hot spots), we have performed time-series
photometric monitoring of WISE 0855-0714 at 3.6 and 4.5 micron with the Spitzer
Space Telescope during two 23~hr periods that were separated by several months.
For both bands, we have detected variability with peak-to-peak amplitudes of
4-5% and 3-4% in the first and second epochs, respectively. The light curves
are semi-periodic in the first epoch for both bands, but are more irregular in
the second epoch. Models of patchy clouds have predicted a large increase in
mid-IR variability amplitudes (for a given cloud covering fraction) with the
appearance of water ice clouds at $T_{\rm eff}<$375 K, so if such clouds are
responsible for the variability of WISE 0855-0714, then its small amplitudes of
variability indicate a very small deviation in cloud coverage between
hemispheres. Alternatively, the similarity in mid-IR variability amplitudes
between WISE 0855-0714 and somewhat warmer T and Y dwarfs may suggest that they
share a common origin for their variability (i.e., not water clouds). In
addition to our variability data, we have examined other constraints on the
presence of water ice clouds in the atmosphere of WISE 0855-0714, including the
recent mid-IR spectrum from \citet{ske16}. We find that robust evidence of such
clouds is not yet available.

(dSphs) can be used to test whether or not ultralight axions with $m_a\sim
10^{-22}\text{eV}$ are a preferred dark matter candidate. However, comparisons
to theoretical predictions tend to be inconclusive for the simple reason that
while most cosmological models consider only dark matter, one observes only
baryons. Here we use realistic kinematic mock data catalogs of Milky Way dSph's
to show that the ""mass-anisotropy degeneracy"" in the Jeans equations leads to
biased bounds on the axion mass in galaxies with unknown dark matter halo
profiles. In galaxies with multiple chemodynamical components this bias can be
partly removed by modelling the mass enclosed within each subpopulation.
However, analysis of the mock data reveals that the least-biased constraints on
the axion mass result from fitting the luminosity-averaged velocity dispersion
of the individual chemodynamical components directly. Applying our analysis to
two dSph's with reported stellar subcomponents, Fornax and Sculptor, and
assuming that the halo profile has not been acted on by baryons, yields core
radii $r_{c}>1.5$ kpc and $r_c> 1.2$ kpc respectively, and $m_a<0.4\times
10^{-22}\text{eV}$ at 97.5\% confidence. These bounds are in tension with the
number of observed satellites derived from simple (but conservative) estimates
of the subhalo mass function in Milky Way-like galaxies. We discuss how
baryonic feedback might affect our results, and the impact of such a small
axion mass on the growth of structures in the Universe.

beneficial in many applications of recurrent neural networks. Nevertheless it
suffers from two major computational limitations. First, its computations for
an attention lookup scale linearly in the size of the attended sequence.
Second, it does not encode the sequence into a fixed-size representation but
instead requires to memorize all the hidden states. These two limitations
restrict the use of the softmax attention mechanism to relatively small-scale
applications with short sequences and few lookups per sequence. In this work we
introduce a family of linear attention mechanisms designed to overcome the two
limitations listed above. We show that removing the softmax non-linearity from
the traditional attention formulation yields constant-time attention lookups
and fixed-size representations of the attended sequences. These properties make
these linear attention mechanisms particularly suitable for large-scale
applications with extreme query loads, real-time requirements and memory
constraints. Early experiments on a question answering task show that these
linear mechanisms yield significantly better accuracy results than no
attention, but obviously worse than their softmax alternative.

rise to a smooth bundle of polarized Abelian varieties, endowed with a flat

paper, I develop a formalism for algorithmic design in quantum annealers, which
I call the `inference primitive' formalism. This formalism allows for a natural
description of calls to quantum annealers with a general control structure.
This more generalized control structure includes not only the ability to
include initial conditions in an annealer run, but also to control the
annealing schedules of qubits or clusters of qubits independently, thereby
representing relative certainty values of different parts of a candidate
solution. I discuss the compatability of such controls with a wide variety of
other current efforts to improve the performance of annealers, such as
non-stoquatic drivers, synchronizing freeze times for the qubits, and belief
propagation techniques. To demonstrate the power of the formalism I present
here, I discuss how this new formalism can be used to represent annealer
implementations of genetic algorithms, and can represent the addition of
genetic components to currently used algorithms. The new tools I develop will
allow a more complete understanding of the algorithmic space available to
quantum annealers, and thereby make the field more competitive.

specified dimensions, in a bipartite graph. Finding a complete subgraph in a
bipartite graph is a problem that has growing attention in several domains,
including bioinformatics, social network analysis and domain clustering. A key
step for a successful phase transition study is identifying a suitable order
parameter, when none is known. To this purpose, we have applied a decision tree
classifier to real-world instances of this problem, in order to understand what
problem features separate an instance that is hard to solve from those that is
not. We have successfully identified one such order parameter and with it the
phase transition of finding a complete bipartite subgraph of specified
dimensions. Our phase transition study shows an
easy-to-hard-to-easy-to-hard-to-easy pattern. Further, our results indicate
that the hardest instances are in a region where it is more likely that the
corresponding bipartite graph will have a complete subgraph of specified
dimensions, a positive answer. By contrast, instances with a negative answer
are more likely to appear in a region where the computational cost is
negligible. This behaviour is remarkably similar for problems of a number of
different sizes.

between $\Lambda_{\rm TC}$ and the electroweak scale depends on vacuum
(mis)alignment and can be sizable, yielding an attractive framework for natural
EWSB; ii) As the strong sector is based on SU(4)/Sp(4), a fundamental
(UV-complete) description of the strong sector is possible, that is informed by
the lattice; iii) The lightest vector resonances occur in the 10-plet, 5-plet

cancelation in the $S$ parameter, and a suppressed 5-plet contribution; iv)
Higgs coupling deviations are typically of $\mathcal O(1\%)$; v) The 10-plet
isotriplet resonances decay dominantly to a massive technipion and a gauge

underlying frequency vector can be approximated efficiently. Recently there has
been considerable effort in extending this problem to that of estimating
functions of a matrix that is presented as a data-stream. This setting
generalizes classical problems to the analogous ones for matrices. For example,
instead of estimating frequent-item counts, we now wish to estimate
""frequent-direction"" counts. A related example is to estimate norms, which now
correspond to estimating a vector norm on the singular values of the matrix.
Despite recent efforts, the current understanding for such matrix problems is
considerably weaker than that for vector problems.
  We study a number of aspects of estimating matrix norms in a stream that have
not previously been considered: (1) multi-pass algorithms, (2) algorithms that
see the underlying matrix one row at a time, and (3) time-efficient algorithms.
Our multi-pass and row-order algorithms use less memory than what is provably
required in the single-pass and entrywise-update models, and thus give
separations between these models (in terms of memory). Moreover, all of our
algorithms are considerably faster than previous ones. We also prove a number
of lower bounds, and obtain for instance, a near-complete characterization of

In a
public-goods game, each individual pays a cost for cooperation, or to prevent
defection, and receives a reward from the collected cost in a group. Thus,
defection is beneficial for each individual, while cooperation is beneficial
for the group. Now, groups (say, countries) consisting of individual players
also play games. To study such a multi-level game, we introduce a hierarchical
public-goods (HPG) game in which two groups compete for finite resources by
utilizing costs collected from individuals in each group. Analyzing this HPG
game, we found a hierarchical prisoner's dilemma, in which groups choose the
defection policy (say, armaments) as a Nash strategy to optimize each group's
benefit, while cooperation optimizes the total benefit. On the other hand, for
each individual within a group, refusing to pay the cost (say, tax) is a Nash
strategy, which turns to be a cooperation policy for the group, thus leading to
a hierarchical dilemma. Here, the reward received by one group increases with
the population, as does the collected cost. In spite of this, we find that
there exists an optimal group size that maximizes its payoff. Furthermore, when
the population asymmetry between two groups is large, a smaller group will
choose a cooperation policy (say, disarmament) to avoid excessive response from
the larger group, which leads to the resolution of the prisoner's dilemma
between the groups. The relevance of the HPG game to policy selection in
society and the optimal size in human or animal groups are discussed
accordingly.

stars ([Fe/H]~ 0.15 +- 0.05 dex). The occurrence rates of these hot exoplanets
increases to ~30% for super-solar metallicity stars from ~10% for stars with a
sub-solar metallicity. Cooler exoplanets, that resides at longer orbital
periods and constitute the bulk of the exoplanet population with an occurrence
rate of >~ 90%, have host-star metallicities consistent with solar. At short
orbital periods, P<10 days, the difference in host star metallicity is largest
for hot rocky planets (<1.7 R_Earth), where the metallicity difference is
[Fe/H] =~ 0.25 +- 0.07 dex. The excess of hot rocky planets around metal-rich
stars implies they either share a formation mechanism with hot Jupiters, or
trace a planet trap at the protoplanetary disk inner edge which is
metallicity-dependent. We do not find statistically significant evidence for a
previously identified trend that small planets toward the habitable zone are
preferentially found around low-metallicity stars. Refuting or confirming this

tool for the study of ordering phenomena in correlated electron systems. Yet,
the interpretation of the RXS experiments remains theoretically challenging due
to the complexity of the RXS cross-section. Central to this debate is the
recent proposal that impurity-induced Friedel oscillations, akin to
quasiparticle interference signals observed with the scanning tunneling
microscope (STM), can lead to scattering peaks in the RXS experiments. The
possibility that quasiparticle properties can be probed in RXS measurements
opens up a new avenue to study the bulk band structure of materials with the
orbital and element selectivity provided by RXS. Here, we test these ideas by
combining RXS and STM measurements of the heavy fermion compound CeMIn$_5$ (M =
Co, Rh). Temperature and doping dependent RXS measurements at the Ce-M$_4$ edge
show a broad scattering enhancement that correlates with the appearance of
heavy f-electron bands in these compounds. The scattering enhancement is
consistent with the measured quasiparticle interference signal in the STM
measurements, indicating that quasiparticle interference can be probed through
the momentum distribution of RXS signals. Overall, our experiments demonstrate
new opportunities for studies of correlated electronic systems using the RXS
technique.

stochastic gravitational wave background (ISGWB) as a function of frequency for
ground- and space-based interferometers and observations of the cosmic
microwave background. The origin of a circularly polarized ISGWB may be due to
exotic primordial physics (i.e., parity violation in the early universe) and
may be strongly frequency dependent. We present calculations within a coherent
framework which clarifies the basic requirements for sensitivity to circular
polarization, in distinction from previous work which focused on each of these
techniques separately. We find that the addition of an interferometer with the
sensitivity of the Einstein Telescope in the southern hemisphere improves the
sensitivity of the ground-based network to circular polarization by about a
factor of two. The sensitivity curves presented in this paper make clear that
the wide range in frequencies of current and planned observations ($10^{-18}\
{\rm Hz} \lesssim f \lesssim 100\ {\rm Hz}$) will be critical to determining
the physics that underlies any positive detection of circular polarization in
the ISGWB. We also identify a desert in circular polarization sensitivity for
frequencies between $10^{-15}\ {\rm Hz} \lesssim f \lesssim 10^{-3}\ {\rm Hz}$,
given the inability for pulsar timing arrays and indirect-detection methods to
distinguish the gravitational wave polarization.

dynamical evolution of (1) binary stars and (2) star clusters.
  (1) Supernovae in binaries can drastically alter the orbit of the system,
sometimes disrupting it entirely, and are thought to be partially responsible
for `runaway' massive stars - stars in the Galaxy with large peculiar
velocities. The ejection of the lower-mass secondary component of a binary
occurs often in the event of the more massive primary star exploding as a
supernova. The orbital properties of binaries that contain massive stars mean
that the observed velocities of runaway stars (10s - 100s km s$^{-1}$) are
consistent with this scenario.
  (2) Star formation is an inherently inefficient process, and much of the
potential in young star clusters remains in the form of gas. Supernovae can in
principle expel this gas, which would drastically alter the dynamics of the
cluster by unbinding the stars from the potential. However, recent numerical
simulations, and observational evidence that gas-free clusters are observed to
be bound, suggest that the effects of supernova explosions on the dynamics of
star clusters are likely to be minimal.

discs to weak bars to strongly barred systems (= 20%). Bars in these systems
develop after redshift = 1.3, on timescales that depend sen- sitively on the
strength of the pattern. Strong bars develop relatively quickly (in a few Gyr,
= 10 disc rotation periods) in systems that are disc dominated, gas poor, and
have declining rotation curves. Weak bars develop more slowly in systems where
the disc is less gravitation- ally important, and are still growing at z = 0.
Unbarred galaxies are comparatively gas-rich discs whose rotation speeds do not
exceed the maximum circular velocity of the halos they inhabit. Bar lengths
compare favourably with observations, ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 times the radius
containing 90% of the stars. Bars slow down remarkably quickly as they grow,
causing the inner regions of the surrounding dark halo to expand. At z = 0
strong bars have corota- tion radii roughly ten times the bar length. Such slow
bars are inconsistent with the few cases where pattern speeds have been
measured or inferred observationally, a discrepancy that, if confirmed, might
prove a challenge for disc galaxy formation in LCDM.

defined by transformations that leave the thermal equilibrium state unchanged,
in classical (incoherent) and quantum (coherent) regimes. We note that in the
infinite-temperature limit the thermodynamic ordering of states in both regimes
exhibits a lattice structure. This means that when energy does not matter and
the only thermodynamic resource is given by information, the thermodynamic
arrow of time has a very specific structure. Namely, for any two states at
present there exists a unique state in the past consistent with them and with
all possible joint pasts. Similarly, there also exists a unique state in the
future consistent with those states and with all possible joint futures. We
also show that the lattice structure in the classical regime is broken at
finite temperatures, i.e., when energy is a relevant thermodynamic resource.
Surprisingly, however, we prove that in the simplest quantum scenario of a
two-dimensional system, this structure is preserved at finite temperatures. We
provide the physical interpretation of these results by introducing and
analysing the history erasure process, and point out that quantum coherence may
be a necessary resource for the existence of an optimal erasure process.

filamentary structure. Using column-density maps based on dust-continuum
emission observations with ALMA+Herschel, we identify filaments and show that
at least one dense core is located along them. We measure the filament width
W_fil=0.17$\pm$0.08pc and the sonic scale {\lambda}_sonic=0.15$\pm$0.11pc of
the turbulence, and find W_fil~{\lambda}_sonic. A strong velocity gradient is
seen in the HNCO intensity-weighted velocity maps obtained with ALMA+Mopra,
which is likely caused by large-scale shearing of G0.253+0.016, producing a
wide double-peaked velocity PDF. After subtracting the gradient to isolate the
turbulent motions, we find a nearly Gaussian velocity PDF typical for
turbulence. We measure the total and turbulent velocity dispersion,
8.8$\pm$0.2km/s and 3.9$\pm$0.1km/s, respectively. Using magnetohydrodynamical
simulations, we find that G0.253+0.016's turbulent magnetic field
B_turb=130$\pm$50$\mu$G is only ~1/10 of the ordered field component. Combining
these measurements, we reconstruct the dominant turbulence driving mode in

solenoidal (divergence-free) driving. We compare this to spiral-arm clouds,
which typically have a significant compressive (curl-free) driving component
(b>0.4). Motivated by previous reports of strong shearing motions in the CMZ,
we speculate that shear causes the solenoidal driving in G0.253+0.016 and show
that this reduces the star formation rate (SFR) by a factor of 6.9 compared to

analytic criteria for the dynamical stability of such pro/retrograde systems.
Numerical studies of inclined systems phenomenologically mapped their stability
regions, but neither complement it by theoretical framework, nor provided
satisfactory fit for their dependence on mutual inclinations. Here we present a
novel approach to study the stability of hierarchical three-body systems at
arbitrary inclinations, which accounts not only for the instantaneous stability
of such systems, but also for the secular stability and evolution through
Lidov-Kozai cycles and evection. We generalize the Hill-stability criteria to
arbitrarily inclined triple systems, explain the existence of quasi-stable
regimes and characterize the inclination dependence of their stability. We
complement the analytic treatment with an extensive numerical study, to test
our analytic results. We find excellent correspondence up to high inclinations
$(\sim120^{\circ}$), beyond which the agreement is marginal. At such high
inclinations the stability radius is larger, the ratio between the outer and
inner periods becomes comparable, and our secular averaging approach is no
longer strictly valid. We therefore combine our analytic results with
polynomial fits to the numerical results to obtain a generalized stability
formula for triple systems at arbitrary inclinations. Besides providing a
generalized secular-based physical explanation for the stability of non
co-planar systems, our results have direct implications for any triple systems,
and in particular binary planets and moon/satellite systems; we briefly discuss
the latter as a test case for our models.

the system over timescales starting from a few times the radial period to
several precessional periods, but less than the radiation reaction timescale.

the number of periods for which dissipation has no significant effect, e.g. the
conservative timescale. We apply the analytic equations to study the spin

$L_V=10^{2.3 +/- 0.4}$ Lsun) stellar system that is revealed by its sparsely
populated main sequence and a handful of red-giant-branch candidate member
stars. The photometric properties of these stars are compatible with a
metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-2.2) and old (13 Gyr) isochrone located at a distance
modulus of ~18.8, i.e. a distance of ~57 kpc. Situated at 11.3$^\circ$ from the
LMC in projection, its 3-dimensional distance from the Cloud is ~13 kpc,
consistent with a connection to the LMC, whose tidal radius is at least 16 kpc.
Although the nature of SMASH 1 remains uncertain, its compactness favors it
being a stellar cluster and hence dark-matter free. If this is the case, its
dynamical tidal radius is only <19 pc at this distance from the LMC, and
smaller than the system's extent on the sky. Its low luminosity and apparent
high ellipticity ($\epsilon=0.62^{+0.17}_{-0.21}$) with its major axis pointing
toward the LMC may well be the tell-tale sign of its imminent tidal demise.

structures, particularly structures with cyclic symmetry. We show that normal
modes of symmetric structures have different levels of symmetry, or
symmetricity. One novel theoretical result of this work is that, for a ring
structure with $m$ subunits, the symmetricity of the normal modes falls into
$m$ groups of equal size, with normal modes in each group having the same
symmetricity. The normal modes in each group can be computed separately, using
a much smaller amount of memory and time (up to $m^3$ less), thus making it
applicable to larger complexes. We show that normal modes with perfect symmetry
or anti-symmetry have no degeneracy while the rest of the modes have a
degeneracy of two. We show also how symmetry in normal modes correlates with
symmetry in structure. While a broken symmetry in structure generally leads to
a loss of symmetricity in symmetric normal modes, the symmetricity of some
symmetric normal modes is preserved even when symmetry in structure is broken.
This work suggests a deeper reason for the existence of symmetric complexes:
that they may be formed not only for structural purpose, but likely also for a
dynamical reason, that certain symmetry is needed by a given complex to obtain
certain symmetric motions that are functionally critical.

computer science and statistical physics. It amounts to constructing a
$k$-colouring of $G$ which is distributed close to {\em Gibbs distribution} in
polynomial time. Here, we deal with the problem when the underlying graph is an
instance of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,d/n)$, where $d$ is a
sufficiently large constant.
  We propose a novel efficient algorithm for approximate random $k$-colouring
$G(n,d/n)$ for any $k\geq (1+\epsilon)d$. To be more specific, with probability
at least $1-n^{-\Omega(1)}$ over the input instances $G(n,d/n)$ and for $k\geq
(1+\epsilon)d$, the algorithm returns a $k$-colouring which is distributed
within total variation distance $n^{-\Omega(1)}$ from the Gibbs distribution of
the input graph instance.
  The algorithm we propose is neither a MCMC one nor inspired by the message
passing algorithms proposed by statistical physicists. Roughly the idea is as
follows: Initially we remove sufficiently many edges of the input graph. This
results in a ""simple graph"" which can be $k$-coloured randomly efficiently. The
algorithm colours randomly this simple graph. Then it puts back the removed
edges one by one. Every time a new edge is put back the algorithm updates the
colouring of the graph so that the colouring remains random.

notion. As a major consequence, it becomes clear why quality can be measured
only to a certain extend based on the issues of validity and incompleteness.
First, there is an inherent conflict between the applicability and validity of
quality measures and second, quality considerations almost always refer to
high-dimensional spaces with only sparse knowledge also known as ""curse of
dimensionality"". The resulting gap of knowledge has to be filled by experienced
based heuristics. To deal with the curse of dimensionality, the heuristics of
categorizing qualities into strategic and necessary is proposed. Strategic
qualities provide contrast, while necessary qualities rather diminish contrast.
In an economic context the presence of strategic qualities motivate a
buy-decision and the absence of necessary qualities motivate a
don't-buy-decision.

observations carried out within the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey, complemented
by IRAS-IRIS and Planck-HFI maps. Data from the Arecibo legacy Fast ALFA Survey
is used to derive atomic gas column densities for two broad velocity
components, low and intermediate velocity clouds. Dust emissivities are derived
for each gas component and each far-infared/submm band. For the low velocity
clouds, we measure an average emissivity 0.79 +/- 0.08 times 1E-20 MJy sr^-1
cm^2 at 250 um. After fitting a modified blackbody to the available bands, we
estimated a dust absorption cross-section 0.49 +/- 0.13 times 1E-25 cm^2 H^-1
at 250 um (with dust temperature T = 20.4 +/- 1.5 K and spectral index beta =
1.53 +/- 0.17). The results are in excellent agreement with those obtained by
Planck over a much larger coverage of the high Galactic latitude cirrus (50% of
the sky vs 0.2% in our work). For dust associated with intermediate velocity
gas, we confirm earlier Planck results and find a higher temperature and lower
emissivity and cross-section. After subtracting the modelled components, we
find regions at scales smaller than 20' where the residuals deviate
significantly from the average, cosmic-infrared-background dominated, scatter.
These large residuals are most likely due to local variations in the cirrus
dust properties (and/or the dust/atomic-gas correlation) or to high-latitude
molecular clouds with average N_H2 <~ 1E20 cm^-2. We find no conclusive
evidence for intracluster dust emission in Virgo.

centre of inversion, parity is no longer a good quantum number and an
electronic antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC) is allowed to exist by
symmetry. If this ASOC is sufficiently large, it has profound consequences on
the superconducting state. For example, it generally leads to a superconducting
pairing state which is a mixture of spin-singlet and spin-triplet components.
The possibility of such novel pairing states, as well as the potential for
observing a variety of unusual behaviours, led to intensive theoretical and
experimental investigations. Here we review the experimental and theoretical
results for superconducting systems lacking inversion symmetry. Firstly we give
a conceptual overview of the key theoretical results. We then review the
experimental properties of both strongly and weakly correlated bulk materials,
as well as two dimensional systems. Here the focus is on evaluating the effect
of ASOC on the superconducting properties and the extent to which there is
evidence for singlet-triplet mixing. This is followed by a more detailed
overview of theoretical aspects of non-centrosymmetric superconductivity. This
includes the effects of the ASOC on the pairing symmetry and the
superconducting magnetic response, magneto-electric effects, superconducting
finite momentum pairing states, and the potential of non-centrosymmetric

triangulated category of motives on $X$. Using work of Ayoub (2007),
Cisinski-Deglise (2012) and Geisser-Levine (2000), we show that this system of
categories has a six functors formalism and computes higher Chow groups.
Indeed, it behaves similarly to other categories of sheaves that one is used
to. We attempt to make its construction also accessible to non-experts. We then
consider the subcategory of stratified mixed Tate motives defined for affinely
stratified varieties $X$, discuss perverse and parity motives and prove
formality results. As an example, we combine these results and Soergel (2000)
to construct a geometric and graded version of Soergel's modular category
$\mathscr O(G)$, consisting of rational representations of a split semisimple
group $G/\mathbb{k}$, and thereby equip it with a full six functor formalism
(see Riche-Soergel-Williamson (2014) and Achar-Riche (2016) for other
approaches). The main idea of using motives in geometric representation theory
in this way as well as many results about stratified mixed Tate motives are
directly borrowed from Soergel and Wendt, who tell the story in characteristic
zero.

  Methods",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent progress in randomized motion planners has led to the development of a
new class of sampling-based algorithms that provide asymptotic optimality
guarantees, notably the RRT* and the PRM* algorithms. Careful analysis reveals
that the so-called ""rewiring"" step in these algorithms can be interpreted as a
local policy iteration (PI) step (i.e., a local policy evaluation step followed
by a local policy improvement step) so that asymptotically, as the number of
samples tend to infinity, both algorithms converge to the optimal path almost
surely (with probability 1). Policy iteration, along with value iteration (VI)
are common methods for solving dynamic programming (DP) problems. Based on this
observation, recently, the RRT$^{\#}$ algorithm has been proposed, which
performs, during each iteration, Bellman updates (aka ""backups"") on those
vertices of the graph that have the potential of being part of the optimal path
(i.e., the ""promising"" vertices). The RRT$^{\#}$ algorithm thus utilizes
dynamic programming ideas and implements them incrementally on randomly
generated graphs to obtain high quality solutions. In this work, and based on
this key insight, we explore a different class of dynamic programming
algorithms for solving shortest-path problems on random graphs generated by
iterative sampling methods. These class of algorithms utilize policy iteration
instead of value iteration, and thus are better suited for massive
parallelization. Contrary to the RRT* algorithm, the policy improvement during
the rewiring step is not performed only locally but rather on a set of vertices
that are classified as ""promising"" during the current iteration. This tends to
speed-up the whole process. The resulting algorithm, aptly named Policy
Iteration-RRT$^{\#}$ (PI-RRT$^{\#}$) is the first of a new class of DP-inspired
algorithms for randomized motion planning that utilize PI methods.

flexibility for demand response. An effective control and coordination scheme
of flexible loads requires an accurate and tractable model that captures their
aggregate flexibility. This paper proposes a novel approach to extract the
aggregate flexibility of deferrable loads with heterogeneous parameters using
polytopic projection approximation. First, an exact characterization of their
aggregate flexibility is derived analytically, which in general contains
exponentially many inequality constraints with respect to the number of loads.
In order to have a tractable solution, we develop a numerical algorithm that
gives a sufficient approximation of the exact aggregate flexibility.
Geometrically, the flexibility of each individual load is a polytope, and their
aggregation is the Minkowski sum of these polytopes. Our method originates from
an alternative interpretation of the Minkowski sum as projection. The aggregate
flexibility can be viewed as the projection of a high-dimensional polytope onto
the subspace representing the aggregate power. We formulate a robust
optimization problem to optimally approximate the polytopic projection with
respect to the homothet of a given polytope. To enable efficient and parallel
computation of the aggregate flexibility for a large number of loads, a
muti-stage aggregation strategy is proposed. The scheduling policy for
individual loads is also derived. Finally, an energy arbitrage problem is
solved to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

higher [S/H] and [Si/H] are seen in PDLAs with logN(HI)>21.0. These abundance
discrepancies are independent of their line-of-sight velocity separation from

basic reproductive number of Zika in different municipalities, from an SIR
model with implicit vector dynamics, based on the daily case reporting data of
Antioquia, Colombia, the second most affected country after Brazil. Methods: An
simple SIR model with implicit vector dynamics was derived and used. The
approximate solution of the model in terms of individuals recovered in each
time unit, allowed to obtain estimate of the model parameters including the
basic reproduction number (Ro) and its 95% confidence intervals. These
parameters were estimated via fitting the solution of the model to the daily
reported cumulative cases data from the regional surveillance system. Results:
Ro was estimated for 20 municipalities, all located at less than 2200 meters
above sea level. From January to April 2016, between 17 and 347 cases were
reported from these municipalities. Of these, 15 municipalities had a high
potential for transmission (Ro>1) and 5 had less potential (Ro<1), although in
3 of these, transmission was later possible because its upper confidence
interval of Ro was greater than one. Conclusion: Surveillance and control of
Zika should be directed primarily to municipalities with Ro>1. Furthermore,
strategies that will strengthen the detection and management of cases in the
remaining municipalities should be beneficial to the whole Antioquia region.

response mechanisms in determining recovery from influenza A virus infection.
Animal models of influenza infection further implicate multiple elements of the
immune response in defining the dynamical characteristics of viral infection.
To date, influenza virus models, while capturing particular aspects of the
natural infection history, have been unable to reproduce the full gamut of
observed viral kinetic behaviour in a single coherent framework. Here, we
introduce a mathematical model of influenza viral dynamics incorporating all
major immune components (innate, humoral and cellular) and explore its
properties with a particular emphasis on the role of cellular immunity.
Calibrated against a range of murine data, our model is capable of
recapitulating observed viral kinetics from a multitude of experiments.
Importantly, the model predicts a robust exponential relationship between the
level of effector $\rm CD8^+$ T cells and recovery time, whereby recovery time
rapidly decreases to a fixed minimum recovery time with an increasing level of
effector $\rm CD8^+$ T cells. We find support for this relationship in recent
clinical data from influenza A(H7N9) hospitalised patients. The exponential
relationship implies that people with a lower level of naive $\rm CD8^+$ T
cells may receive significantly more benefit from induction of additional
effector $\rm CD8^+$ T cells arising from immunological memory, itself
established through either previous viral infection or T cell-based vaccines.

after they have left a website. While on-site recommendation systems focus on
finding the most relevant items for a user at the moment (right item), email
recommendations add two critical additional dimensions: who to send
recommendations to (right person) and when to send them (right time). It is
critical that a recommendation email system not send too many emails to too
many users in too short of a time-window, as users may unsubscribe from future
emails or become desensitized and ignore future emails if they receive too
many. Also, email service providers may mark such emails as spam if too many of
their users are contacted in a short time-window. Optimizing email
recommendation systems such that they can yield a maximum response rate for a
minimum number of email sends is thus critical for the long-term performance of
such a system. In this paper, we present a novel recommendation email system
that not only generates recommendations, but which also leverages a combination
of individual user activity data, as well as the behavior of the group to which
they belong, in order to determine each user's likelihood to respond to any
given set of recommendations within a given time period. In doing this, we have
effectively created a meta-recommendation system which recommends sets of

account possible instabilities due to electron capture and pycnonuclear fusion
reactions in the cores of such objects. The structure of white dwarfs is
obtained by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations with a poloidal magnetic
field in a fully general relativistic approach. The stellar interior is
composed of a regular crystal lattice made of carbon ions immersed in a
degenerate relativistic electron gas. The onsets of electron capture reactions
and pycnonuclear reactions are determined with and without magnetic fields. We
find that magnetized white dwarfs violate the standard Chandrasekhar mass limit
significantly, even when electron capture and pycnonuclear fusion reactions are
present in the stellar interior. We obtain a maximum white dwarf mass of around
$2.14\,M_{\odot}$ for a central magnetic field of $\sim 3.85\times 10^{14}$~G,
which indicates that magnetized white dwarfs may play a role for the
interpretation of superluminous type Ia supernovae. Furthermore, we show that
the critical density for pycnonuclear fusion reactions limits the central white
dwarf density to $9.35\times 10^9$ g/cm$^3$. As a result, equatorial radii of
white dwarfs cannot be smaller than $\sim 1100$~km. Another interesting feature
concerns the relationship between the central stellar density and the strength
of the magnetic field at the core of a magnetized white dwarf. For high
magnetic fields, we find that the central density increases (stellar radius
decrease) with magnetic field strength, which makes ultramagnetized white
dwarfs more compact. The opposite is the case, however, if the central magnetic
field is less than $\sim 10^{13}$~G. In the latter case, the central density
decreases (stellar radius increases) with central magnetic field strengths.

exerted by a turbulent flow of air or liquid onto an erodible sediment bed
affects the transport load $M\tilde g$ (i.e., the submerged weight of
transported nonsuspended sediment per unit area) and its average velocity when
exceeding the sediment transport threshold $\tau_t$. Most transport rate
predictions in the literature are based on the scaling $M\tilde
g\propto\tau-\tau_t$, the physical origin of which, however, has remained
controversial. Here we test the universality and study the origin of this
scaling law using particle-scale simulations of nonsuspended sediment transport
driven by a large range of Newtonian fluids. We find that the scaling
coefficient is a universal approximate constant and can be understood as an
inverse granular friction coefficient (i.e., the ratio between granular shear
stress and normal-bed pressure) evaluated at the base of the transport layer
(i.e., the effective elevation of energetic particle-bed rebounds). Usually,
the granular flow at this base is gaslike and rapidly turns into the solidlike
granular bed underneath: a liquidlike regime does not necessarily exist, which
is accentuated by a nonlocal granular flow rheology in both the transport layer
and bed. Hence, this transition fundamentally differs from the solid-liquid
transition (i.e., yielding) in dense granular flows even though both
transitions are described by a friction law. Combining this result with recent
insights into the nature of $\tau_t$, we conclude that the transport load
scaling is a signature of a steady rebound state and unrelated to entrainment
of bed sediment.

broad agreement among themselves and with previous literature values. The
limb-darkened diameter is about 20.3 milliarcseconds on average . However, we
have found indications that the photospheric brightness profile of Aldebaran
may have not been symmetric, a finding already reported by other authors for
this and for similar late-type stars. At the sampling scale of our brightness
profile, between one and two milliarcsecond, the uniform and limb-darkened disc

RESTful web services are light weight services without strict message formats.
RESTful web services, unlike SOAP, are capable of message transfer in any

ensuring message level security in REST is a challenge. Security in RESTful web
services is still largely dependent upon transport layer security. There has

therefore, we propose two new ways of encryption that promise to ensure message

trace the cycle of interstellar matter also lie within this band. However,
water vapor renders the terrestrial atmosphere opaque to this frequency band

nonlinear CTR features are then learned from visual features and other

in the ambient assisted living, where the human activities can be represented
as a concatenated event stream generated from various smart objects. From the
concatenated event stream, each activity should be distinguished separately for
the human activity recognition to provide services that users may need. In this
regard, accurately segmenting the entire stream at the precise boundary of each
activity is indispensable high priority task to realize the activity
recognition. Multiple human activities in an IoT environment generate varying
event stream patterns, and the unpredictability of these patterns makes them
include redundant or missing events. In dealing with this complex segmentation
problem, we figured out that the dynamic and confusing patterns cause major
problems due to: inclusive event stream, redundant events, and shared events.
To address these problems, we exploited the contextual relationships associated
with the activity status about either ongoing or terminated/started. To
discover the intrinsic relationships between the events in a stream, we
utilized the LSTM model by rendering it for the activity segmentation. Then,
the inferred boundaries were revised by our validation algorithm for a bit
shifted boundaries. Our experiments show the surprising result of high accuracy
above 95%, on our own testbed with various smart objects. This is superior to
the prior works that even do not assume the environment with multi-user
activities, where their accuracies are slightly above 80% in their test
environment. It proves that our work is feasible enough to be applied in the
IoT environment.

consistent when all the $2^{p_n}$ models are considered. In the
ultrahigh-dimensional setting, selection of the true model among all the

present a two-step model selection algorithm based on screening and Gibbs

covariates, and retains a smaller set containing all the active covariates with
probability tending to one. In the next step, we search for the best model
among the covariates obtained in the screening step. This procedure is
computationally quite fast, simple and intuitive. We demonstrate competitive

Parameterised Field Theory (PFT). PFT is a generally covariant reformulation of
free field propagation on flat spacetime. We show explicitly that while, as in
LQG, the Hamiltonian constraint operator in PFT acts ultralocally, states in
the joint kernel of the Hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints of PFT
necessarily describe propagation effects. The particular structure of the
finite triangulation Hamiltonian constraint operator plays a crucial role, as
does the necessity of imposing (the continuum limit of) its kinematic adjoint
as a constraint. Propagation is seen as a property encoded by physical states
in the kernel of the constraints rather than that of repeated actions of the
finite triangulation Hamiltonian constraint on kinematic states. The analysis
yields robust structural lessons for putative constructions of the Hamiltonian

controls the false discovery rate (FDR) in finite samples. At each iteration of
the procedure, the analyst proposes a rejection threshold and observes
partially censored p-values, estimates the false discovery proportion (FDP)
below the threshold, and either stops to reject or proposes another threshold,
until the estimated FDP is below $\alpha$. Our procedure is adaptive in an
unusually strong sense, permitting the analyst to use any statistical or

switch between different models at each iteration as information accrues. We
demonstrate the favorable performance of AdaPT by comparing it to

on a variety equipped with flag of subvarieties. This convex body encodes the
asymptotic properties of sections of powers of the line bundle. In this paper,
we study Newton-Okounkov bodies for schemes defined over discrete valuation
rings. We give the basic properties and then focus on the case of toric schemes
and semistable curves. We provide a description of the Newton-Okounkov bodies
for semistable curves in terms of the Baker--Norine theory of linear systems on
graphs, finding a connection with tropical geometry. We do this by introducing
an intermediate object, the Newton-Okounkov linear system of a divisor on a
curve. We prove that it is equal to the set of effective elements of the real
Baker-Norine linear system of the specialization of that divisor on the dual
graph of the curve. As a bonus, we obtain an asymptotic algebraic geometric
description of the Baker-Norine linear system.

S, H, P, H-, N-). These sets of molecules accounts for about 20% of all the
known interstellar and circumstellar molecules, their high abundances therefore
demand a serious attention. High level ab initio quantum chemical calculations
are employed to accurately estimate enthalpy of formation, chemical reactivity
indices; global hardness and softness; and other chemical parameters of these
molecules. Chemical modeling of the abundances of these molecular species has
also been performed. Of the 89 molecules considered from these groups, 47 have
been astronomically observed, these observed molecules are found to be more
stable with respect to other members of the group. Of the 47 observed
molecules, 60% are odd number carbon chains. Interstellar chemistry is not
actually driven by the thermodynamics, it is primarily dependent on various
kinetic parameters. However, we found that the detectability of the odd
numbered carbon chains could be correlated due to the fact that they are more
stable than the corresponding even numbered carbon chains. Based on this
aspect, the next possible carbon chain molecule for astronomical observation in
each group is proposed. The effect of kinetics in the formation of some of
these carbon chain molecules is also discussed.

full inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms emitted from BBHs with the spins
aligned with the orbital angular momentum. Here, we treat the effect of
aligned-spins with a single spin parameter $\chi$. We consider the BBH signals
with moderately small spins in the range of $-0.4\leq \chi \leq 0.4$. Using
nonspinning templates, we calculate fitting factors of the aligned-spin signals

If $\chi = 0.3$, only the highly asymmetric-mass signals can have the fitting
factors exceeding the threshold of 0.965, while the fitting factors for all of
the signals can be larger than the threshold if $\chi = -0.3$. We demonstrate
that the discrepancy between the regions of a positive and a negative spins is
due to the physical boundary ($\eta \leq 0.25$) of the template parameter
space. We also show that the recovered mass parameters can be significantly
biased from the true parameters. We examine the impact of the systematic bias
on the parameter estimation by comparing the bias with the statistical error.

symmetry are numerically found in large-eddy simulations (LES) with no kinetic
viscosity. The small-scale properties are determined by the mixing length scale
$l_S$ used to define eddy viscosity, and the large-scale motion is induced by
the mean shear at the integral scale, which is limited by the spanwise box
dimension $L_z$. The fraction $ R_S= L_z/l_S$, which plays the role of a
Reynolds number, is used as a numerical continuation parameter. It is shown
that equilibrium solutions appear by a saddle-node bifurcation as $R_S$
increases, and that they resemble those in plane Couette flow with the same
symmetry. The vortical structures of both lower- and upper-branch solutions
become spontaneously localised in the vertical direction. The lower-branch
solution is an edge state at low $R_S$, and takes the form of a thin critical
layer as $R_S$ increases, as in the asymptotic theory of generic shear flow at
high-Reynolds numbers. On the other hand, the upper-branch solutions are
characterised by a tall velocity streak with multi-scale multiple vortical
structures. At the higher end of $R_S$, an incipient multiscale structure is
found. The LES turbulence occasionally visits vertically localised states whose
vortical structure resembles the present vertically localised LES equilibria.

$99\sigma$. This weakly measured confined BKS contextuality also confirms the
quantum pigeonhole effect, wherein eigenvalue assignments to contextual

performed at sub-kpc resolution at rest-frame wavelengths dominated by the
light of the underlying old stellar populations. The observed stellar mass -

size evolution proportional to $(1+z)^{-1.25}$, consistent with the literature.
The slope of the stellar mass - size relation $\beta$ = 0.74 $\pm$ 0.06,
consistent with the local relation. The absence of slope evolution indicates
that the amount of size growth is constant with stellar mass. This suggests
that galaxies in massive clusters such as SPT-CL J0546$-$5345 grow via
processes that increase the size without significant morphological
interference, such as minor mergers and/or adiabatic expansion. The slope of
the cluster stellar mass - size relation is significantly shallower if measured
in $HST$/ACS imaging at wavelengths blueward of the Balmer break, similar to
rest-frame UV relations at $z$ = 1 in the literature. The stellar mass - size
relation must be measured at redder wavelengths, which are more sensitive to
the old stellar population that dominates the stellar mass of the galaxies. The
slope is unchanged when GeMS $K_s$-band imaging is degraded to the resolution
of $K$-band HST/NICMOS resolution but dramatically affected when degraded to
$K_s$-band Magellan/FourStar resolution. Such measurements must be made with AO

  discs","8 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In protoplanetary discs, planetary cores must be at least 0.1 earth mass at 1
au for migration to be significant; this mass rises to 1 earth mass at 5 au.
Planet formation models indicate that these cores form on million year
timescales. We report here a study of the evolution of 0.1 earth mass and 1
earth mass cores, migrating from about 2 and 5 au respectively, in million year
old photoevaporating discs. In such a disc, a gap opens up at around 2 au after
a few million years. The inner region subsequently accrete onto the star on a
smaller timescale. We find that, typically, the smallest cores form systems of
non-resonant planets beyond 0.5 au with masses up to about 1.5 earth mass. In
low mass discs, the same cores may evolve in situ. More massive cores form
systems of a few earth masses planets. They migrate within the inner edge of
the disc gap only in the most massive discs. Delivery of material to the inner
parts of the disc ceases with opening of the gap. Interestingly, when the heavy
cores do not migrate significantly, the type of systems that are produced
resembles our solar system. This study suggests that low mm flux transition
discs may not form systems of planets on short orbits but may instead harbour
earth mass planets in the habitable zone.

  Published in Faraday Discussions",,"10.1039/C6FD00110F",,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Techniques for producing cold and ultracold molecules are enabling the study
of chemical reactions and scattering at the quantum scattering limit, with only
a few partial waves contributing to the incident channel, leading to the
observation and even full control of state-to-state collisions in this regime.
A new R-matrix formalism is presented for tackling problems involving low- and
ultra-low energy collisions. This general formalism is particularly appropriate
for slow collisions occurring on potential energy surfaces with deep wells. The
many resonance states make such systems hard to treat theoretically but offer
the best prospects for novel physics: resonances are already being widely used
to control diatomic systems and should provide the route to steering ultracold
reactions. Our R-matrix-based formalism builds on the progress made in
variational calculations of molecular spectra by using these methods to provide
wavefunctions for the whole system at short internuclear distances, (a regime
known as the inner region). These wavefunctions are used to construct collision
energy-dependent R-matrices which can then be propagated to give cross sections
at each collision energy. The method is formulated for ultracold collision
systems with differing numbers of atoms.

five-parameter fitting function that besides a $\phi$-independent term includes
four modulations predicted by theory: $\sin\phi$, $\sin 2 \phi$, $\sin 3\phi$
and $\cos\phi$. The amplitudes of the five terms have been extracted, first,
for the hadrons in the whole available kinematic region. In further fits,
performed for hadrons from a restricted kinematic region, the $\phi$-dependence
is determined as a function of one of three variables (Bjorken-$x$, fractional
energy of virtual photon taken by the outgoing hadron and hadron transverse
momentum), while disregarding the others. Except the $\phi$-independent term,
all the modulation amplitudes are very small, and no clear kinematic dependence
could be observed within experimental uncertainties.

constructed. The formula depends on identifying a natural relevant
self-generated, time-dependent dynamical process inherent in any entity. For
human beings the relevant dynamical process identified is the ensemble of brain
waves, observed in EEG measurements, that are represented in the model by their
measured time dependent correlation functions. These correlation functions
define the accessible dynamical state of the brain at any moment of time. From
them a time dependent probability function, P(t), is extracted by using a
mathematical identity. According to information theory, -P(t) log P(t), is a
measure of the information contained in the brain waves. Consciousness, C, is
defined by this information theory formula: it is not localized, does not
depend on specific hardwire details of the brain, but reflects the information
content present in brain waves. Justifications, based on observational
evidence, are given for the formula and it is shown that C reflects the degree
of ""awareness"" that a person has at a given moment of time. The model explains
the observed time delay between when a brain wave is seen to initiate an action
and when there is awareness that the action has been initiated, in terms of the
way brain waves processes information. Some testable consequences of the model,
including the role dreaming sleep plays in long term memory storage, are

  Spectral Resolutions: a Fusion-Based Approach",,,,,"cs.CV physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Change detection is one of the most challenging issues when analyzing
remotely sensed images. Comparing several multi-date images acquired through
the same kind of sensor is the most common scenario. Conversely, designing
robust, flexible and scalable algorithms for change detection becomes even more
challenging when the images have been acquired by two different kinds of
sensors. This situation arises in case of emergency under critical constraints.
This paper presents, to the best of authors' knowledge, the first strategy to
deal with optical images characterized by dissimilar spatial and spectral
resolutions. Typical considered scenarios include change detection between
panchromatic or multispectral and hyperspectral images. The proposed strategy
consists of a 3-step procedure: i) inferring a high spatial and spectral
resolution image by fusion of the two observed images characterized one by a
low spatial resolution and the other by a low spectral resolution, ii)
predicting two images with respectively the same spatial and spectral
resolutions as the observed images by degradation of the fused one and iii)
implementing a decision rule to each pair of observed and predicted images
characterized by the same spatial and spectral resolutions to identify changes.
The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on real images with
simulated realistic changes.

  Resolutions for Change Detection",,,,,"cs.CV physics.data-an stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Archetypal scenarios for change detection generally consider two images
acquired through sensors of the same modality. However, in some specific cases
such as emergency situations, the only images available may be those acquired
through different kinds of sensors. More precisely, this paper addresses the
problem of detecting changes between two multi-band optical images
characterized by different spatial and spectral resolutions. This sensor
dissimilarity introduces additional issues in the context of operational change
detection. To alleviate these issues, classical change detection methods are
applied after independent preprocessing steps (e.g., resampling) used to get
the same spatial and spectral resolutions for the pair of observed images.
Nevertheless, these preprocessing steps tend to throw away relevant
information. Conversely, in this paper, we propose a method that more
effectively uses the available information by modeling the two observed images
as spatial and spectral versions of two (unobserved) latent images
characterized by the same high spatial and high spectral resolutions. As they
cover the same scene, these latent images are expected to be globally similar
except for possible changes in sparse spatial locations. Thus, the change
detection task is envisioned through a robust multi-band image fusion method
which enforces the differences between the estimated latent images to be
spatially sparse. This robust fusion problem is formulated as an inverse
problem which is iteratively solved using an efficient block-coordinate descent
algorithm. The proposed method is applied to real panchormatic/multispectral
and hyperspectral images with simulated realistic changes. A comparison with
state-of-the-art change detection methods evidences the accuracy of the
proposed strategy.

$\equiv_{\mathrm{m}}^{(r)}$ of equivalence relations by saying that $x

finer as $r$ increases, and we define a new group invariant $\psi(G)$ to be the
value of $r$ at which they stabilise to $\equiv_{\mathrm{m}}$.
  Remarkably, we are able to prove that if $G$ is soluble then $\psi(G) \in
\{d(G), d(G) +1\}$, where $d(G)$ is the minimum number of generators of $G$,
and to classify the finite soluble groups $G$ for which $\psi(G) = d(G)$. For
insoluble $G$, we show that $d(G) \leq \psi(G) \leq d(G) + 5$. However, we know
of no examples of groups $G$ for which $\psi(G) > d(G) + 1$.
  As an application, we look at the generating graph of $G$, whose vertices are
the elements of $G$, the edges being the $2$-element generating sets. Our
relation $\equiv_{\mathrm{m}}^{(2)}$ enables us to calculate
$\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma(G))$ for all soluble groups $G$ of nonzero spread, and

($T_{C}=203$~K) has been investigated in the context of the non-adiabatic and
anharmonic effects. The Migdal-Eliashberg equations and the extended Eliashberg
equations, which include the lowest-order vertex corrections, have been solved
numerically in the self-consistent way. For $R3m$ crystal structure, the
lowest-order vertex corrections decrease the value of the Coulomb
pseudopotential from $0.123$ to $0.108$. The anharmonic effects work
antagonistically in relation to the vertex corrections shifting the value of
$\mu^{\star}$ to $0.156$. The studies conducted for the structure
$Im\overline{3}m$, where the Eliashberg function includes both the
non-adiabatic and anharmonic effects, prove the even higher value of
$\mu^{\star}=0.185$. Independently of the assumed method of the analysis, the
nearly identical no mean-field dependence of the order parameter on the
temperature was obtained: $2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{C}\sim 4.7$ - due to the
significant strong-coupling and retardation effects: $\lambda\sim 2$ and
$k_{B}T_{C}\slash \omega_{\rm \ln}\sim 0.15$-$0.19$. It means that the
classical equations of Migdal-Eliashberg can be treated as a correct effective
model for the superconducting state in $\rm H_{3}S$. This paper has shown that
the McMillan or Allen-Dynes formulas substantially lower the value of the
critical temperature in relation to the result obtained with the Eliashberg

approximations hold, and, in particular, a Yukawa-type potential can be used to
describe the screened Coulomb interaction and the Born series converges. Our
results show that including the second order Born approximation yields much
shorter spin relaxation times compared to the commonly implemented first Born
approximation: spin relaxation times may be reduced by hundreds of picoseconds,
with the first Born approximation overestimating results by 30% or more for a
large region of parameters. Though our ensemble Monte Carlo simulations include
electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, when considering low to
intermediate carrier densities and $T > 50 $ $\mathrm{K}$, but $T$ smaller than

an avenue to increase the bandwidth of quantum communications and provides more

the entanglement of multiple orbital angular momentum states of light. The
system is based on a degenerate filter that cannot distinguish between
different anti-symmetric states, and thus entanglement swapping occurs for
several thousand pairs of spatial light modes simultaneously.

mass matrix which incorporates the atmospheric mass splitting and sets
\theta_{23} = \pi/4. The solar splitting and \theta_{13} are absent, while the
third mixing angle can achieve any value, \theta_{12}^0. Specific choices of
\theta_{12}^0 are of interest, e.g., 35.3^\circ (tribimaximal), 45.0^\circ

of the Type-I see-saw is to nudge all the above into the range indicated by the

due to their common origin, making it readily falsifiable. For example, normal
(inverted) ordering is associated with \theta_{23} in the first (second)
octant. CP-violation is controlled by phases in the right-handed neutrino
Majorana mass matrix, M_{\nu R}. In their absence, only normal ordering is
admissible. When M_{\nu R} is complex the Dirac CP-phase, \delta, can be large,
i.e., \sim \pm \pi/2, and inverted ordering is also allowed. The preliminary
results from T2K and NOVA which favour normal ordering and \delta \sim -\pi/2

corresponding results for the one-point and the two-point functions were
already known, but those for the higher-point functions are new. These results
demonstrate strong correlations associated with the existence of common

the gluon energies, we deduce the mean gluon multiplicity $\langle N\rangle$ as
well as the higher moments $\langle N^p\rangle$ with $p\ge 2$. We find that the

biofilms is well-established in the published literature. However, the modeling
of population dynamics in biofilms from the viewpoint of social interactions,
i.e. interplay between heterotypic strains, and the analysis of this kind using
control theory are not addressed significantly. Therefore, in this paper, we
theoretically analyze the population dynamics model in microbial biofilms with
non-participating strains (coexisting with public goods producers and
non-producers) in the context of evolutionary game theory and nonlinear
dynamics. Our analysis of the replicator dynamics model is twofold: first
without the inclusion of spatial pattern, and second with the consideration of
degree of assortment. In the first case, Lyapunov stability analysis of the
stable equilibrium point of the proposed replicator system determines (1,0)
('full dominance of cooperators') as a global asymptotic stable equilibrium
whenever the return exceeds the metabolic cost of cooperation. Hence, the
global asymptotic stable nature of (1,0) in the context of non-consideration of
spatial pattern helps to justify mathematically the adversity in the
eradication of ""cooperative enterprise"" that is an infectious biofilm. In the
second case, we found non-existence of global asymptotic stability in the
system, and it unveils two additional phenomena - bistability and coexistence.
In this context, two inequality conditions are derived for the 'full dominance
of cooperators' and coexistence. Therefore, the inclusion of spatial pattern in
biofilms with non-competing strains intends conditional dominance of pathogenic
(with respect to the hosts) public goods producers which can be an effective
strategy towards the control of an infectious biofilm with the drug-dependent
regulation of degree of segregation.

conservation, which was shown previously to be responsible for the generation
of stable fronts via a so-called wave-pinning mechanism. The extended model
gives rise to a unique homogeneous equilibrium in the parameter region of
interest, which loses stability via a pattern formation, or Turing bifurcation.
The bistable character of the reaction terms ensures that this bifurcation is
subcrtical for sufficiently small values of the driving parameter multiplying
the nonlinear kinetics. This subcriticality leads to the onset of a multitude
of localised solutions, through the homoclinic snaking mechanism. As the
driving parameter is further decreased, the multitude of solutions transforms
into a single pulse through a Belyakov-Devaney transition in which there is the
loss of a precursive pattern. An asymptotic analysis is used to probe the
conservative limit in which the source and loss terms vanish. Matched
asymptotic analysis shows that on an infinite domain the pulse solution
transitions into a pair of fronts, with an additional weak quadratic core and
exponential tails. On a finite domain, the core and tails disappear, leading to
the mere wave-pinning front and its mirror image.

recent years. In these approaches, the tracking model heavily relies on the
quality of the training set. Due to the limited amount of labeled training
data, additional samples need to be extracted and labeled by the tracker
itself. This often leads to the inclusion of corrupted training samples, due to
occlusions, misalignments and other perturbations. Existing
tracking-by-detection methods either ignore this problem, or employ a separate
component for managing the training set.
  We propose a novel generic approach for alleviating the problem of corrupted
training samples in tracking-by-detection frameworks. Our approach dynamically
manages the training set by estimating the quality of the samples. Contrary to
existing approaches, we propose a unified formulation by minimizing a single
loss over both the target appearance model and the sample quality weights. The
joint formulation enables corrupted samples to be down-weighted while
increasing the impact of correct ones. Experiments are performed on three
benchmarks: OTB-2015 with 100 videos, VOT-2015 with 60 videos, and Temple-Color
with 128 videos. On the OTB-2015, our unified formulation significantly
improves the baseline, with a gain of 3.8% in mean overlap precision. Finally,
our method achieves state-of-the-art results on all three datasets. Code and

magnetic field a spontaneous U(1)-symmetry breaking (SSB) and an off-diagonal
long range order (ODLRO) occur. The system is defined on a hyper-cubic lattice
with periodic boundary conditions at positive temperature. In the free part of
the Hamiltonian we assume the nearest-neighbor hopping. The chemical potential
is fixed so that the free Fermi surface does not degenerate. The term
representing the interaction between electrons' spin and the imaginary external
magnetic field is the z-component of the spin operator multiplied by a pure
imaginary parameter. The SSB and the ODLRO are shown in the infinite-volume
limit of the thermal average over the full Fermionic Fock space. The magnitude
of the negative coupling constant must be larger than a certain value so that
the gap equation is solvable. The gap equation is different from that of the
conventional mean field BCS model because of the presence of the imaginary
magnetic field. By adjusting the imaginary magnetic field this model shows the
SSB and the ODLRO in high temperature, weak coupling regimes where the
conventional reduced BCS model does not show these phenomena. The proof is
based on Grassmann Gaussian integral formulations and a double-scale
integration scheme to analytically control the formulations.

light-emitting diodes using a bisanthracene derivative, BD1, as the emitting
molecule, off-diagonal vibronic coupling constants (VCCs) between the excited
states of BD1, which govern non-radiative transition rates, were calculated
employing time-dependent density functional theory. The VCCs were analysed
based on the concept of vibronic coupling density. The VCC calculations suggest
a fluorescence via higher triplets (FvHT) mechanism, which entails the
conversion of a T$_4$ exciton generated during electrical excitation into an
S$_2$ exciton via reverse intersystem crossing (RISC); moreover, the S$_2$
exciton relaxes to a fluorescent S$_1$ exciton because of large vibronic
coupling between S$_2$ and S$_1$. This mechanism is valid as long as the
relaxation of triplet states higher than T$_1$ to lower states is suppressed.
The symmetry-controlled thermally activated delayed fluorescence (SC-TADF) and
inverted singlet and triplet (iST) structure, which have been proposed in our
previous studies, are the special examples of the FvHT mechanism that need high
molecular symmetry. However, BD1 achieves the FvHT mechanism in spite of its
asymmetrical structure. A general condition for the suppression of radiative
and non-radiative transitions in molecules with pseudo-degenerate electronic
structures such as BD1 is discussed. A superordinate concept, fluorescence via
RISC, which includes TADF, SC-TADF, iST structure, and FvHT is also proposed.

store different counter values of a run in registers so that they can be
compared with one another. As the model-checking problem is undecidable in
general, we focus on the flat fragment of freeze LTL, in which the usage of the
freeze quantifier is restricted. In a previous work, Lechner et al. showed that
model checking for flat freeze LTL on OCA with binary encoding of counter
updates is decidable and in 2NEXPTIME. In this paper, we prove that the problem
is, in fact, NEXPTIME-complete no matter whether counter updates are encoded in
unary or binary. Like Lechner et al., we rely on a reduction to the
reachability problem in OCA with parameterized tests (OCA(P)). The new aspect
is that we simulate OCA(P) by alternating two-way automata over words. This
implies an exponential upper bound on the parameter values that we exploit
towards an NP algorithm for reachability in OCA(P) with unary updates. We
obtain our main result as a corollary. As another application, relying on a
reduction by Bundala and Ouaknine, one obtains an alternative proof of the

impact of the present data on reactor decay heat using summation calculations.
Although the effect is relatively small it helps to reduce the discrepancy
between calculations and integral measurements of the photon component for 235U
fission at cooling times in the range 1 to 100 s. We also use summation
calculations to evaluate the impact of present data on reactor antineutrino

emission from neutron unbound states populated in the daughter nucleus. The
gamma branching is compared to Hauser-Feshbach calculations which allow one to
explain the large value for bromine isotopes as due to nuclear structure.
However the branching for 94Rb, although much smaller, hints of the need to
increase the radiative width by one order-of-magnitude. This leads to a similar
increase in the calculated (n,gamma) cross section for this very neutron-rich

have a compressible-incompressible structure in which the interior pressure
exerted by the fluid on the floating body is a Lagrange multiplier that can be
determined through the resolution of a $d$-dimensional elliptic equation, where
$d$ is the horizontal dimension. In the case where the object is freely
floating, we decompose the hydrodynamic force and torque exerted by the fluid
on the solid in order to exhibit an added mass effect; in the one dimensional
case $d=1$, the computations can be carried out explicitly. We also show that
this approach in which the interior pressure appears as a Lagrange multiplier
can be implemented on reduced asymptotic models such as the nonlinear shallow
water equations and the Boussinesq equations; we also show that it can be
transposed to the discrete version of these reduced models and propose simple
numerical schemes in the one dimensional case. We finally present several
numerical computations based on these numerical schemes; in order to validate

using the point-particle approximation. We demonstrate that the random point
process formed by the positions of particles in space is a Poisson point
process with log-normal random intensity (""log Gaussian Cox process"" or LGCP).
The probability of having a finite number of particles in a small volume is
given in terms of the characteristic function of a log-normal distribution.
Corrections due to discreteness of the number of particles to the previously
derived statistics of particle concentration in the continuum limit are
provided. These are relevant for dealing with experimental or numerical data.
The probability of having regions without particles, i.e. voids, is larger for
inertial particles than for tracer particles where voids are distributed
according to Poisson processes. Further, the probability of having large voids
decays only log-normally with size. This shows that particles cluster, leaving
voids behind. At scales where there is no clustering there can still be an
increase of the void probability so that turbulent voiding is stronger than
clustering. The demonstrated double stochasticity of the distribution
originates in the two-step formation of fluctuations. First, turbulence brings
the particles randomly close together which happens with Poisson-type
probability. Then, turbulence compresses the particles' volume in the
observation volume. We confirm the theory of the statistics of the number of
particles in small volumes by numerical observations of inertial particle
motion in a chaotic ABC flow. The improved understanding of clustering
processes can be applied to predict the long-time survival probability of
reacting particles. Our work implies that the particle distribution in weakly
compressible flow with finite time correlations is a LGCP, independently of the
details of the flow statistics.

is simply a perfect matching. For a given fixed $F$, it is often the case that
the decision problem whether an $n$-vertex $k$-graph $H$ contains a perfect

for perfect matchings is NP-complete whilst if $k=2$ the problem is NP-complete
in the case when $F$ has a component consisting of at least $3$ vertices.
  In this paper we give a general tool which can be used to determine classes
of (hyper)graphs for which the corresponding decision problem for perfect
$F$-packings is polynomial time solvable. We then give three applications of
this tool: (i) Given $1\leq \ell \leq k-1$, we give a minimum $\ell$-degree
condition for which it is polynomial time solvable to determine whether a
$k$-graph satisfying this condition has a perfect matching; (ii) Given any

solvable to determine whether a graph satisfying this condition has a perfect
$F$-packing; (iii) We also prove a similar result for perfect $K$-packings in
$k$-graphs where $K$ is a $k$-partite $k$-graph.
  For a range of values of $\ell,k$ (i) resolves a conjecture of Keevash, Knox

relate the time scales obtained to primary and secondary eclipse of the

influence of the presence of a planet or a spot on that spectrum over one

coefficient {\alpha}_R=5 eV{\AA}. Significant changes in the electronic band
structure has been observed across the phase transitions from paramagnetic to
antiferromagnetic (44 K) and from antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic ground
state (41.5 K). We find that Pr 4f states in PrGe is strongly hybridized with
the Pr 5d and Ge 4s-4p states near the Fermi level. The behavior of Rashba
effect is found to be different in the k_x and the k_y directions showing
electron-like and the hole-like bands, respectively. The possible origin of
Rashba effect in the paramagnetic phase is related to the anti-parallel spin
polarization present in this system. First-principles density functional
calculations of Pr terminated surface with the anti-parallel spins shows a fair
agreement with the experimental results. We find that the anti-parallel spins
are strongly coupled to the lattice such that the PrGe system behaves like weak
ferromagnetic system. Analysis of the energy dispersion curves at different
magnetic phases showed that there is a competition between the
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction and the exchange interaction which gives rise
to the magnetic ordering in PrGe. Supporting evidences of the presence of
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction are observed as anisotropic magnetoresistance
with respect to field direction and first-order type hysteresis in the X-ray
diffraction measurements. A giant negative magnetoresistance of 43% in the
antiferromagnetic phase and tunable Rashba parameter with temperature across
the magnetic transitions makes this material a suitable candidate for
technological application in the antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.

been a long-standing algorithmic challenge, dating back nearly 30 years to a
survey of Karp & Ramachandran (1990). The best randomized parallel algorithm
for hypergraphs of fixed rank $r$ was developed by Beame & Luby (1990) and
Kelsen (1992), running in time roughly $(\log n)^{r!}$.
  We improve the randomized algorithm of Kelsen, reducing the runtime to
roughly $(\log n)^{2^r}$ and simplifying the analysis through the use of
more-modern concentration inequalities. We also give a method for derandomizing
concentration bounds for low-degree polynomials, which are the key technical
tool used to analyze that algorithm. This leads to a deterministic PRAM
algorithm also running in $(\log n)^{2^{r+3}}$ time and $\text{poly}(m,n)$
processors. This is the first deterministic algorithm with sub-polynomial
runtime for hypergraphs of rank $r > 3$.
  Our analysis can also apply when $r$ is slowly growing; using this in
conjunction with a strategy of Bercea et al. (2015) gives a deterministic MIS
algorithm running in time $\exp(O( \frac{\log (mn)}{\log \log (mn)}))$.

theory for the asymmetric single-impurity Anderson model [C. Mora $et al.$,
Phys. Rev. B, 92, 075120 (2015)] to the case of an arbitrary local magnetic
field. To describe the system's low-lying quasiparticle excitations for
arbitrary values of the bare Hamiltonian's model parameters, we construct an
effective low-energy FL Hamiltonian whose FL parameters are expressed in terms
of the local level's spin-dependent ground-state occupations and their
derivatives with respect to level energy and local magnetic field. These
quantities are calculable with excellent accuracy from the Bethe Ansatz
solution of the Anderson model. Applying this effective model to a quantum dot
in a nonequilibrium setting, we obtain exact results for the curvature of the
spectral function, $c_A$, describing its leading $\sim\varepsilon^2$ term, and
the transport coefficients $c_V$ and $c_T$, describing the leading $\sim V^2$
and $\sim T^2$ terms in the nonlinear differential conductance. A sign change
in $c_A$ or $c_V$ is indicative of a change from a local maximum to a local
minimum in the spectral function or nonlinear conductance, respectively, as is
expected to occur when an increasing magnetic field causes the Kondo resonance
to split into two subpeaks. We find that the fields $B_A$, $B_T$ and $B_V$ at
which $c_A$, $c_T$ and $c_V$ change sign, respectively, are all of order $T_K$,

pumping through slowly driven open quantum systems. This approach applies to
strongly interacting systems that are weakly coupled to multiple reservoirs at
high temperature, illustrated by an Anderson quantum dot, but shows potential
for generalization. Pumping gives rise to a nonadiabatic geometric phase that
can be described by a framework originally developed for classical dissipative
systems by Landsberg. This geometric phase is accumulated by the transported
observable (charge, spin, energy) and not by the quantum state. It thus differs
radically from the adiabatic Berry-Simon phase, even when generalizing it to
mixed states, following Sarandy and Lidar. Importantly, our geometric
formulation of pumping stays close to a direct physical intuition (i) by tying
gauge transformations to calibration of the meter registering the transported
observable and (ii) by deriving a geometric connection from a driving-frequency
expansion of the current. Our approach provides a systematic and efficient way
to compute the geometric pumping of various observables, including charge,
spin, energy and heat. Our geometric curvature formula reveals a general
experimental scheme for performing geometric transport spectroscopy that
enhances standard nonlinear spectroscopies based on measurements for static
parameters. We indicate measurement strategies for separating the useful
geometric pumping contribution to transport from nongeometric effects. Finally,
we highlight several advantages of our approach in an exhaustive comparison
with the Sinitsyn-Nemenmann full-counting statistics (FCS) approach to
geometric pumping of an observable`s first moment. We explain how in the FCS
approach an ""adiabatic"" approximation leads to a manifestly nonadiabatic result
involving a finite retardation time of the response to parameter driving.

atmospheric turbulence. In the gaseous planets these jets are maintained by
incoherent turbulence excited by small-scale convection. Large-scale coherent
waves are sometimes observed to coexist with the jets; a prominent example is
Saturn's hexagonal North polar jet (NPJ). The mechanism responsible for forming
and maintaining such a turbulent state remains elusive. The coherent
planetary-scale component of the turbulence arises and is maintained by
interaction with the incoherent small-scale turbulence component. Theoretical
understanding of the dynamics of the jet/wave/turbulence coexistence regime is
gained by employing a statistical state dynamics (SSD) model. Here, a
second-order closure implementation of a two-layer beta-plane SSD is used to
develop a theory that accounts for the structure and dynamics of the NPJ.
Asymptotic analysis of the SSD equilibrium in the weak jet damping limit
predicts a universal jet structure in agreement with NPJ observations. This
asymptotic theory also predicts the wavenumber (six) of the prominent jet
perturbation. Analysis with this model of the jet/wave/turbulence regime
dynamics reveals that jet formation is controlled by the effective value of
$\beta$; the required value of this parameter for correspondence with
observation is obtained. As this is a robust prediction it is taken as an
indirect observation of a deep poleward sloping stable layer beneath the NPJ.
The slope required is obtained from observations of NPJ structure as is the
small-scale turbulence excitation required to maintain the jet. The observed
jet structure is then predicted by the theory as is the wave-six disturbance.
This wave, which is identified with the least stable mode of the equilibrated
jet, is shown to be primarily responsible for equilibrating the jet with the
observed structure and amplitude.

well-known AGN spectra that have been reported to have ultra-fast outflows, and

bright magnetars 4U 0142+61 and 1RXS J1708-4009, applying the filtering method
to Suzaku data. We found that neither source showed any significant indication
of line features, even using long Suzaku observations and dividing their
spectra into spin phases. The upper limits on the equivalent width of
emission/absorption lines are constrained to be a few eV at ~1 keV, and a few
hundreds of eV at ~10 keV. This strengthens previous reports that persistently
bright magnetars do not show proton cyclotron absorption features in soft
X-rays and, even if they exist, they would be broadened or much weaker than
below the detection limit of X-ray CCD.

popular devices in superconducting electronics. They combine the Josephson
effect with the quantization of magnetic flux in superconductors. This gives
rise to one of the most beautiful manifestations of macroscopic quantum
coherence in the solid state. In addition, SQUIDs are extremely sensitive
sensors allowing to transduce magnetic flux into measurable electric signals.
As a consequence, any physical observable that can be converted into magnetic
flux, e.g., current, magnetization, magnetic field or position, becomes easily
accessible to SQUID sensors. In the late 1980's it became clear that downsizing
the dimensions of SQUIDs to the nanometric scale would encompass an enormous
increase of their sensitivity to localized tiny magnetic signals. Indeed,
nanoSQUIDs opened the way to the investigation of, e.g., individual magnetic
nanoparticles or surface magnetic states with unprecedented sensitivities. The
purpose of this review is to present a detailed survey of microscopic and
nanoscopic SQUID sensors. We will start by discussing the principle of
operation of SQUIDs, placing the emphasis on their application as
ultrasensitive detectors for small localized magnetic signals. We will continue
by reviewing a number of existing devices based on different kinds of Josephson
junctions and materials, focusing on their advantages and drawbacks. The last
sections are left for applications of nanoSQUIDs in the fields of scanning
SQUID microscopy and magnetic particle characterization, putting special stress

Specifically, transfer learning from the task of object recognition is
exploited to more effectively train good features for material classification.
The approach of transfer learning using convnets yields significantly higher

then analyze the relative contribution of reflectance and shading information
by a decomposition of the image into its intrinsic components. The use of
convnets for material classification was hindered by the strong demand for

take into account the effects of collisions between ions and the inclusion of
Hall's term in the induction equation. Through the analysis of the
corresponding dispersion relations and numerical simulations we check that at
high frequencies ions of different species are not as strongly coupled as in
the low frequency limit. Hence, they cannot be treated as a single fluid. In
addition, elastic collisions between the distinct ionized species are not
negligible for high frequency waves since an appreciable damping is obtained.
Furthermore, Coulomb collisions between ions remove the cyclotron resonances
and the strict cut-off regions that are present when collisions are not taken
into account. The implications of these results for the modelling of
high-frequency waves in solar plasmas are discussed.

put in question. D-brane inflation proposes candidates for an inflaton embedded
in the string theory and possesses descriptions on the brane and bulk
metrics/frames, which are connected by a conformal/disformal transformation
that depends on the inflaton and its derivatives. It has been shown that
curvature perturbations generated by the inflaton are identical in both frames,
meaning that observables such as the spectrum of cosmic microwave background
(CMB) anisotropies are independent of whether matter fields---including those
in the standard model of particle physics---minimally couple to the brane or
the bulk metric/frame. This is true despite the fact that the observables are
eventually measured by the matter fields and that the total action including
the matter fields is different in the two cases. In contrast, in curvaton
scenarios, the observables depend on the frame to which the curvaton minimally
couples. Among all inflationary scenarios, we focus on two models motivated by
the KKLMMT fine-tuning problem: a slow-roll inflation with an inflection-point
potential and a model of a rapidly rolling inflaton that conformally couples to
gravity. In the first model, the difference between the frames in which the
curvaton resides is encoded in the spectral index of the curvature
perturbations, depicting the nature of the frame transformation. In the second
model, the curvaton on the brane induces a spectral index significantly
different from that in the bulk and is even falsified by the observations. This
work thus demonstrates that two frames connected by a conformal/disformal
transformation lead to different physical observables such as CMB anisotropies
in curvaton models.

positive integer values of $\zeta$, the lowest $\zeta$ states turn out to be
exactly solvable for DSG - a feature known as Quasi-Exact-Solvability (QES) -
and solvable to all orders in perturbation theory for TDW. For DSG such states
do not show any instanton-like dependence on the coupling constant, although
the action has real saddles. On the other hand, although it has no real
saddles, the TDW admits all-orders perturbative states that are not
normalizable, and hence, requires a non-perturbative energy shift. Both of
these puzzles are solved by including complex saddles. We show that the
convergence is dictated by the quantization of the hidden topological angle.
Further, we argue that the QES systems can be linked to the exact cancellation
of real and complex non-perturbative saddles to all orders in the
semi-classical expansion. We also show that the entire resurgence structure
remains encoded in the analytic properties of the $\zeta$-deformation, even
though exactly at integer values of $\zeta$ the mechanism of resurgence is
obscured by the lack of ambiguity in both the Borel sum of the perturbation
theory as well as the non-perturbative contributions. In this way, all of the
characteristics of resurgence remains even when its role seems to vanish, much
like the lingering grin of the Cheshire Cat. We also show that the perturbative
series is Self-resurgent -a feature by which there is a one-to-one relation
between the early terms of the perturbative expansion and the late terms of the

give detailed and new bounds on (block) GMRES that take the special behavior of

BMS primary fields and surprisingly find that symmetries constrain these
correlators to be identical to those of a 2d relativistic conformal field
theory. We then go one dimension higher and construct prototypical examples of
4d field theories which are putative duals of 5d Minkowski spacetimes. These
field theories are ultra-relativistic limits of electrodynamics and Yang-Mills
theories which exhibit invariance under the conformal Carroll group in D=4. We
explore the different sectors within these Carrollian gauge theories and
investigate the symmetries of the equations of motion to find that an infinite

gauge bosons. More specifically, we consider a hadronic Z boson, which makes it
possible to determine properties of X at an earlier stage. For $m_X$ of O(1)
TeV, two quarks from a Z boson would be captured as a ""merged jet"" in a
significant fraction of events. The use of the merged jet enables us to
consider a Z-induced jet as a reconstructed object without any combinatorial
ambiguity. We apply a conventional jet substructure method to extract
four-momenta of subjets from a merged jet. We find that jet substructure
procedures may enhance features in some kinematic observables formed with
subjets. Subjet momenta are fed into the matrix element associated with a given
hypothesis on the nature of X, which is further processed to construct a matrix
element method (MEM)-based observable. For both moderately and highly boosted Z
bosons, we demonstrate that the MEM with current jet substructure techniques
can be a very powerful discriminator in identifying the physics nature of X. We
also discuss effects from choosing different jet sizes for merged jets and
jet-grooming parameters upon the MEM analyses.

measurements show an enormous increase of the ferroelectric polarization, and a
change in its direction from along the c- to the a-axis. Our results suggest
that the drastic change of multiferroic properties results from a switch of the
spin-current magnetoelectric coupling in bulk TbMnO3 to symmetric
magnetostriction in epitaxially-strained TbMnO3. These findings experimentally
demonstrate that epitaxial strain can be used to control single-phase
spin-driven multiferroic states.

clustering algorithms is a necessary computation as it ensures independent task
completion, fair distribution, less number of affected points and better &
faster merging. Though partitioning using Kd Tree is being conventionally used
in academia, it suffers from performance drenches and bias (non equal
distribution) as dimensionality of data increases and hence is not suitable for
practical use in industry where dimensionality can be of order of 100s to
1000s. To address these issues we propose two new partitioning techniques using
existing mathematical models & study their feasibility, performance (bias and
partitioning speed) & possible variants in choosing initial seeds. First method
uses an n dimensional hashed grid based approach which is based on mapping the
points in space to a set of cubes which hashes the points. Second method uses a
tree of voronoi planes where each plane corresponds to a partition. We found
that grid based approach was computationally impractical, while using a tree of
voronoi planes (using scalable K-Means++ initial seeds) drastically
outperformed the Kd-tree tree method as dimensionality increased.

promising to be a high capacity electrode material for metal ion batteries.
Firstly, identified by phonon dispersion and exfoliation energy calculations,
MoN2 monolayer is proved to be structurally stable and could be exfoliated from
its bulk counterpart in experiments. Secondly, all the studied metal atoms (Li,
Na and K) can be adsorbed on MoN2 monolayer, with both pristine and doped MoN2
being metallic. Thirdly, the metal atoms possess moderate/low migration
barriers on MoN2, which ensures excellent cycling performance as a battery
electrode. In addition, the calculated average voltages suggest that MoN2
monolayer is suitable to be a cathode for Li-ion battery and anodes for Na-ion
and K-ion batteries. Most importantly, as a cathode for Li-ion battery, MoN2
possesses a comparable average voltage but a 1-2 times larger capacity (432 mA
h g-1) than usual commercial cathode materials; as an anode for Na-ion battery,
the theoretical capacity (864 mA h g-1) of MoN2 is 2-5 times larger than

The
reason is twofold: classically, they provide a tracking solution leading to an
almost DeSitter space starting from very generic initial conditions in the deep
radiation era. The second reason is the standard lore that Galileons are
quantum mechanically stable. The latter property is certainly true in flat
space-time, thanks to the non-renormalization theorems of galilean coupling
constants. However, in a cosmological background, we show that quantum effects
might dominate the classical trajectory. Assuming the radiation era to last at
least up to the electroweak phase transition, the trajectory with initial
conditions sitting on the tracker is ruled out. On the other hand, it is always
possible to find a sub-space of initial conditions such that the dark energy
solution approaches stably the tracker at late times. Fixing the value of
initial conditions that best fit current data, and assuming that the galileon
effective theory is valid up to the beginning of the radiation epoch, we found
that the reheating temperature of the universe cannot be larger than $10^8 \

of Galileons, the bounds by EUCLID on the initial conditions for these models
will also be a bound on the reheating temperature of our Universe.

reveal the need for scaling {with amplitude}. The global properties of the
complex spatio-temporal dynamics and dissipation in broad spectrum ocean waves
is modeled by damping $\epsilon = h F/(2Q_0)$, where $h$ is the tidal wave
amplitude, $F$ is the tidal frequency, and $Q_0$ is the $Q$-factor at the
present time. It satisfies $Q_0\simeq 14$ for consistency of migration time and
age of the Moon consistent with observations for a near-resonance state today.
It shows a startingly fast eviction of the Moon from an unstable
near-synchronous orbit close to the Roche limit, probably in a protolunar disk.
Rapid spin down of the Earth from an intial $\sim30\%$ of break-up by the Moon
favored early formation of a clement global climate. Our theory suggests moons
may be similarly advantageous to potentially habitable exoplanets.

  Computer Science at University College London",,,,"stat.AP cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of this thesis is to investigate the potential of predictive
modelling for football injuries. This work was conducted in close collaboration
with Tottenham Hotspurs FC (THFC), the PGA European tour and the participation
of Wolverhampton Wanderers (WW).
  Three investigations were conducted:
  1. Predicting the recovery time of football injuries using the UEFA injury
recordings: The UEFA recordings is a common standard for recording injuries in
professional football. For this investigation, three datasets of UEFA injury
recordings were available. Different machine learning algorithms were used in
order to build a predictive model. The performance of the machine learning
models is then improved by using feature selection conducted through
correlation-based subset feature selection and random forests.
  2. Predicting injuries in professional football using exposure records: The
relationship between exposure (in training hours and match hours) in
professional football athletes and injury incidence was studied. A common
problem in football is understanding how the training schedule of an athlete
can affect the chance of him getting injured. The task was to predict the
number of days a player can train before he gets injured.
  3. Predicting intrinsic injury incidence using in-training GPS measurements:
A significant percentage of football injuries can be attributed to overtraining
and fatigue. GPS data collected during training sessions might provide
indicators of fatigue, or might be used to detect very intense training
sessions which can lead to overtraining. This research used GPS data gathered
during training sessions of the first team of THFC, in order to predict whether
an injury would take place during a week.

foundation for QFT, and it is the basis for proving some important general
results, such as the well-known spin-statistics theorem. Free-field QFT meets
the axioms of axiomatic QFT, showing they are consistent. Nevertheless, even
after more than 50 years, there is still no known non-trivial theory of quantum
fields with interactions in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime that meets the
same axioms.
  This paper provides a similar axiomatic basis for parameterized QFT, in which
an invariant, fifth path parameter is added to the usual four spacetime
position arguments of quantum fields. Dynamic evolution is in terms of the path
parameter rather than the frame-dependent time coordinate. Further, the states
of the theory are allowed to be off shell. Particles are therefore
fundamentally ""virtual"" during interaction but, in the appropriate
non-interacting, large-time limit, they dynamically tend towards ""physical"",
on-shell states.
  Unlike traditional QFT, it is possible to define a mathematically consistent
interaction picture in parameterized QFT. This may be used to construct
interacting fields that meet the same axioms as the corresponding free fields.
One can then re-derive the Dyson series for scattering amplitudes, but without
the mathematical inconsistency of traditional, perturbative QFT. The present
work is limited to the case of scalar fields, and it does not address remaining
issues of gauge symmetry and renormalization. Nevertheless, it still
demonstrates that the parameterized formalism can provide a consistent
foundation for the interpretation of QFT as used in practice and, perhaps, for
better dealing with its further mathematical issues.

"1610.00992","Serge Wagner","Serge Wagner","Existence of Minkowski space","27 preprint pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Minkowski space serves as a framework for the theoretical constructions that
deal with manifestations of relativistic effects in physical phenomena. But
neither Minkowski himself nor the subsequent developers of the relativity
theory have provided a reasonable rationale for this mathematical construct. In
physics, such a rationale should show lower-level statements that determine
where the proposed mathematical structure is applicable and yield formal
premises for proving its existence.
  The above failure has apparently been due to the features of the adopted
formalism based on the unjustifiably exclusive use of coordinates in the
theoretical analysis of physical phenomena, which ignores the necessity of
having physical grounds for mathematical concepts. In particular, the use of a
coordinate transformation between two inertial reference frames makes the
consideration so cumbersome that it appears useless for solving the fundamental
problems of physical theory, including the question of whether Minkowski space
exists.
  In contrast, a straightforward calculation proves that the transformation of
the time and the position vector of a physical event between two physical
spaces establishes an equivalence relation between pairs made of these
variables. This means the existence of Minkowski space and shows that the
premises for its proof are the same as for the coordinate-free derivation of
basic effects of the special relativity theory: the use of Einsteinian time
variable and motions of particles able to interact with each other and
electromagnetic field over a short spatial range only.
  The high degeneracy of free motions of point particles, together with the
intricacy of the above mentioned calculation, suggests that a further
generalization of Minkowski space is beyond belief, so that the modification or
even the abandonment of the concept of spacetime seems quite natural.

with the fixed memory. The memory is redistributed in the course of modeling by
the variation of the set of classical states and the accuracy of the

preserves the conventional formalism and does not contradicts to experiments,
but it makes impossible fast quantum algorithms. This description involves the
slow down of quantum evolutions with the growth of the dimension of the minimal
subspace containing entangled states, which arise in the evolution. This slow
down is the single difference of the proposed formalism from the standard one;
it is negligible for the systems from the usual experiments, including those in
which many entangled particle participate, but grows rapidly in the attempt to
realize the scalable quantum computations, which require the unlimited
parallelism. The experimental verification of this version of quantum formalism
is reduced to the fixation of this slow down.
