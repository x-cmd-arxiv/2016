effective for robotics, among other fields. MPC performs re-planning at every
time step. Re-planning is done with a limited horizon per computational and
real-time constraints and often also for robustness to potential model errors.
However, the limited horizon leads to suboptimal performance. In this work, we
consider the iterative learning setting, where the same task can be repeated
several times, and propose a policy improvement scheme for MPC. The main idea
is that between executions we can, offline, run MPC with a longer horizon,
resulting in a hindsight plan. To bring the next real-world execution closer to
the hindsight plan, our approach learns to re-shape the original cost function
with the goal of satisfying the following property: short horizon planning (as
realistic during real executions) with respect to the shaped cost should result
in mimicking the hindsight plan. This effectively consolidates long-term
reasoning into the short-horizon planning. We empirically evaluate our approach
in contact-rich manipulation tasks both in simulated and real environments,
such as peg insertion by a real PR2 robot.

directionally is a fun- damental question in cell biology. Physical models of
cell motility commonly rely on gradients of regulatory factors and/or feedback
from the motion itself to describe polarization of edge activity. Theses
approaches, however, fail to explain cell behavior prior to the onset of
polarization. Our analysis using the model system of polarizing and moving fish
epidermal keratocytes suggests a novel and simple principle of
self-organization of cell activity in which local cell-edge dynamics depends on
the distance from the cell center, but not on the orientation with respect to
the front-back axis. We validate this principle with a stochastic model that
faithfully reproduces a range of cell-migration behaviors. Our findings
indicate that spontaneous polarization, persistent motion, and cell shape are
emergent properties of the local cell-edge dynamics controlled by the distance
from the cell center.

allow to dynamically control the interface charge state by adding or removing

simulated annealing when approaching the spin-glass transition at temperature
$T=0$ of the two-dimensional Ising model with random $J= \pm 1$ couplings.
Analyzing the spin-glass order parameter and the excess energy as functions of
the system size and the annealing velocity in Monte Carlo simulations with
Metropolis dynamics, we find scaling where the energy relaxes slower than the
spin-glass order parameter, i.e., there are two different dynamic exponents.
The values of the exponents relating the relaxation time scales to the system
length, $\tau \sim L^z$, are $z=8.28 \pm 0.03$ for the relaxation of the order
parameter and $z=10.31 \pm 0.04$ for the energy relaxation. We argue that the
behavior with dual time scales arises as a consequence of the entropy-driven
ordering mechanism within droplet theory. We point out that the dynamic
exponents found here for $T \to 0$ simulated annealing are different from the
temperature-dependent equilibrium dynamic exponent $z_{\rm eq}(T)$, for which
previous studies have found a divergent behavior; $z_{\rm eq}(T\to 0) \to
\infty$. Thus, our study shows that, within Metropolis dynamics, it is easier
to relax the system to one of its degenerate ground states than to migrate at
low temperatures between regions of the configuration space surrounding
different ground states. In a more general context of optimization, our study
provides an example of robust dense-region solutions for which the excess
energy (the conventional cost function) may not be the best measure of success.

these tasks often require hundreds or thousands of examples. But do end-to-end
approaches need to learn a unique model for every task? Intuitively, it seems
that sharing across tasks should help since all tasks require some common

step in data-driven end-to-end learning frameworks: move from the realm of
task-specific models to joint learning of multiple robot tasks. In an

2-flat contains more than $s$ lines of $L$ (here we require that the lines of
$L$ also be contained in the surface). Then the number of incidences between
$P$ and $L$ is $$ I(P,L) = O\left(m^{1/2}n^{1/2}D^{1/2} + m^{2/3}D^{2/3}s^{1/3}
+ m + n\right). $$ When $d=3$, this improves the bound of Guth and Katz for
this special case, when $D \ll n^{1/2}$. Moreover, the bound does not involve
the term $O(nD)$, that arises in most standard approaches, and its removal is a
significant aspect of our result. Finally, we also obtain (slightly weaker)
variants of both results over the complex field. For two-dimensional varieties,
the bound is as in the real case, with an added term of $O(D^3)$. For
three-dimensional varieties, the bound is as in the real case, with an added
term of $O(D^6)$.

in a nested tree-like structure. Previous work addressing the stance

assumptions about the conversational structure. We experiment with eight
Twitter datasets, collected during breaking news, and show that exploiting the
sequential structure of Twitter conversations achieves significant improvements

conversations as a tree structure in this manner, introducing a novel way of
tackling NLP tasks on Twitter conversations.

strongly coupled three-dimensional homogeneous electron gas (HEG). From its
dispersion and its satisfaction of the 3rd frequency sum rule we identify it
with the conjectured magnetic excitation in the HEG. This excitation, is
maintained by the out-of-phase oscillations of the spin-up and spin-down
densities of the electron liquid, but governed solely by the Coulomb
interaction between the particles. The frequency square of this mode is
proportional to the overlap ($r=0$) (absolute) value of the spin-up/spin-down
correlation function, and thus slightly affected by, but not contingent upon
the degree of polarization of the electron liquid. We estimate the spectral
weight of the mode: it is expected to be governed by electron-electron
collision induced spin drag. The spectral weight is manifest in the partial
spin-resolved dynamical structure functions and it is proportional to the
product of the densities of the two spin components. An independent derivation
based on a generalized Feynman Ansatz corroborates our result. The relationship
to the recently identified ""spin plasmon"" excitation is discussed. It is
pointed out that a scattering experiment with polarized neutrons or polarized
X-rays may be possible avenues to observe equilibrium fluctuations associated
with these modes and also to provide information on the spin drag coefficient
in the HEG.

leading to smaller asymptotic MSE of the estimating equations and associated

demonstrate all of these superior properties in finite samples, and we apply

dozens of vertices. Our method is based on the phenomenon of the ""Consensus

not depend on the particular choice of the dataset. We think that our present

all depending on their surpluses. The charging station can serve users using
renewable energy and conventional energy. Users may select longer deadlines as
they may have to pay less because of the less amount of conventional energy,
however, they have to wait a longer period. We consider a {\em myopic} charging
station and show that there exists a pricing mechanism which jointly maximizes
the social welfare and the profit of the charging station when the charging
station knows the utilities of the users. However, when the charging station
does not know the utilities of the users, the social welfare pricing strategy
may not maximize the expected profit of the charging station and even the
profit may be $0$. We propose a fixed profit pricing strategy which provides a
guaranteed fixed profit to the charging station and can maximize the profit in
practice. We empirically show that our proposed mechanism reduces the

allowing defenders to construct algorithms which bypass harmful nodes. Previous
work has characterized limitations in the perfect identification of adversarial
attacks on deterministic LTI systems. For instance, a system must remain
observable after removing any 2q sensors to only identify q attacks. However,
the ability for an attacker to create an unidentifiable attack requires
knowledge of the system model. In this paper, we aim to limit the adversary's
knowledge of the system model with the goal of accurately identifying all
sensor attacks. Such a scheme will allow systems to withstand larger attacks or
system operators to allocate fewer sensing devices to a control system while
maintaining security. We explore how changing the dynamics of the system as a
function of time allows us to actively identify malicious/faulty sensors in a
control system. We discuss the design of time varying system matrices to meet
this goal and evaluate performance in deterministic and stochastic systems.

  ""Does your scheme have additional fancy properties?"" the fisherman asked.
""Yes, the scheme has other security guarantees: revocability, testability and

epidemiological data. Recently, advances in sequencing technology have led to
increasing interest in Bayesian approaches to inferring who infected whom using
genetic data from pathogens. The logic behind such approaches is that isolates
that are nearly genetically identical are more likely to have been recently
transmitted than those that are very different. A number of methods have been
developed to perform this inference. However, testing their convergence,
examining posterior sets of transmission trees and comparing methods'
performance are challenged by the fact that the object of inference - the
transmission tree - is a complicated discrete structure. We introduce a metric
on transmission trees to quantify distances between them. The metric can
accommodate trees with unsampled individuals, and highlights differences in the
source case and in the number of infections per infector. We illustrate its
performance on simple simulated scenarios and on posterior transmission trees
from a TB outbreak. We find that the metric reveals where the posterior is
sensitive to the priors, and where collections of trees are composed of
distinct clusters. We use the metric to define median trees summarising these
clusters. Quantitative tools to compare transmission trees to each other will
be required for assessing MCMC convergence, exploring posterior trees and
benchmarking diverse methods as this field continues to mature.

crystallization of a many-body system with dissipationless flow of the atoms it
is built of. This quantum phase requires the breaking of two continuous
symmetries, the phase invariance of a superfluid and the continuous
translational invariance to form the crystal,. Proposed for helium almost 50
years ago, experimental verification of supersolidity remains elusive. A
variant with only discrete translational symmetry breaking on a preimposed
lattice structure, the `lattice supersolid', has been realized based on
self-organization of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). However, lattice
supersolids do not feature the continuous ground state degeneracy that
characterizes the supersolid state as originally proposed. Here we report the
realization of a supersolid with continuous translational symmetry breaking.
The continuous symmetry emerges from two discrete spatial ones by symmetrically
coupling a BEC to the modes of two optical cavities. We establish the phase
coherence of the supersolid and find a high ground-state degeneracy by
measuring the crystal position over many realizations through the light fields
leaking from the cavities. These light fields are also used to monitor the
position fluctuations in real-time. Our concept provides a route to creating
and studying glassy many-body systems with contrallably lifted ground-state
degeneracies, such as supersolids in the presence of disorder.

ODDC, and the phase diagram perturbation. The adopted SCvH-I equation of state

stellar populations, gas, and dust. Interpreting these data is a challenge for
models: many studies have shown that properties derived from modeling galaxy
photometry are uncertain by a factor of two or more, and yet answering key
questions in the field now requires higher accuracy than this. Here, we present
a new model framework specifically designed for these complexities. Our model,
Prospector-$\alpha$, includes dust attenuation and re-radiation, a flexible
attenuation curve, nebular emission, stellar metallicity, and a 6-component
nonparametric star formation history. The flexibility and range of the
parameter space, coupled with MCMC sampling within the Prospector inference
framework, is designed to provide unbiased parameters and realistic error bars.
We assess the accuracy of the model with aperture-matched optical spectroscopy,
which was excluded from the fits. We compare spectral features predicted solely
from fits to the broadband photometry to the observed spectral features. Our
model predicts H$\alpha$ luminosities with a scatter of $\sim$0.18 dex and an
offset of $\sim$0.1 dex across a wide range of morphological types and stellar
masses. This agreement is remarkable, as the H$\alpha$ luminosity is dependent
on accurate star formation rates, dust attenuation, and stellar metallicities.
The model also accurately predicts dust-sensitive Balmer decrements,
spectroscopic stellar metallicities, PAH mass fractions, and the age- and
metallicity-sensitive features D$_{\mathrm{n}}$4000 and H$\delta$. Although the
model passes all these tests, we caution that we have not yet assessed its
performance at higher redshift or the accuracy of recovered stellar masses.

observations of the star and planet across multiple epochs, it is possible to
resolve the signal of the hot gas giant's atmosphere compared to the brighter

remove the contribution of the Earth's atmosphere to the observed spectra.
Then, we use a cross-correlation analysis to tease out the spectra of the host

0.1 TW under steady-state stellar wind, or ${\sim} 100 {\times}$ stronger than
that on Earth. This corresponds to a planet-star contrast ratio of
$10^{-6}-10^{-7}$ in a narrow band about the 5577\AA\ line, although higher
contrast ($10^{-4}-10^{-5}$) may be possible during periods of strong
magnetospheric disturbance (auroral power $1-10$ TW). We searched the Proxima

contrast must be lower than $2\times 10^{-2}$ (with power $\lesssim$ 3,000 TW),

emission lines are likely infeasible with current and planned telescopes.
However, future observations with a space-based coronagraphic telescope or a
ground-based extremely large telescope (ELT) with a coronagraph could push
sensitivity down to terawatt oxygen aurorae (contrast $7\times 10^{-6}$) with

pressures of more than 2000 times those experienced by Earth from the solar
wind. During an orbit, Proxima b is also subject to pressure changes of 1 to 3
orders of magnitude on timescales of a day. Its magnetopause standoff distance
consequently undergoes sudden and periodic changes by a factor of 2 to 5.
Proxima b will traverse the interplanetary current sheet twice each orbit, and
likely crosses into regions of subsonic wind quite frequently. These effects

it was demonstrated that a new-physics model can simultaneously explain both
the $R_K$ and $R_{D^{(*)}}$ puzzles. There are two UV completions that can give
rise to the effective Lagrangian: (i) $VB$: a vector boson that transforms as
an $SU(2)_L$ triplet, as in the SM, (ii) $U_1$: an $SU(2)_L$-singlet vector
leptoquark. In this paper, we examine these models individually. A key point is
that $VB$ contributes to $B^0_s$-${\bar B}^0_s$ mixing and $\tau \to 3\mu$,
while $U_1$ does not. We show that, when constraints from these processes are
taken into account, the $VB$ model is just barely viable. It predicts ${\cal B}
(\tau^-\to\mu^-\mu^+\mu^-) \simeq 2.1 \times 10^{-8}$. This is measurable at
Belle II and LHCb, and therefore constitutes a smoking-gun signal of $VB$. For
$U_1$, there are several observables that may point to this model. Perhaps the
most interesting is the lepton-flavor-violating decay $\Upsilon(3S) \to \mu
\tau$, which has previously been overlooked in the literature. $U_1$ predicts
${\cal B}(\Upsilon(3S) \to \mu \tau)|_{\rm max} = 8.0 \times 10^{-7}$. Thus, if
a large value of ${\cal B}(\Upsilon(3S) \to \mu \tau)$ is observed -- and this
should be measurable at Belle II -- the $U_1$ model would be indicated.

the dark matter is a fermion with an axial coupling and with a mass either
within a few GeV of the $Z$ resonance ($m_{\rm DM} \simeq m_Z/2$) or greater

Higgs mediated scenarios are currently viable if the mass of the dark matter is
near the Higgs pole ($m_{\rm DM} \simeq m_H/2$). Otherwise, the only scenarios
that are not excluded are those in which the dark matter is a scalar (vector)
heavier than 400 GeV (1160 GeV) with a Higgs portal coupling, or a fermion with

observable parameters that are used to quantify mass segregation and energy
equipartition in star clusters. Mass segregation can be quantified by measuring
how the slope of a cluster's stellar mass function $\alpha$ changes with
clustercentric distance r, and then calculating $\delta_\alpha = \frac{d
\alpha(r)}{d ln(r/r_m)}$ where $r_m$ is the cluster's half-mass radius. The
degree of energy equipartition in a cluster is quantified by $\eta$, which is a
measure of how stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$ depends on stellar mass m
via $\sigma(m) \propto m^{-\eta}$. Through a suite of $N$-body star cluster
simulations with a range of initial sizes, binary fractions, orbits, black hole
retention fractions, and initial mass functions, we present the co-evolution of
$\delta_\alpha$ and $\eta$. We find that measurements of the global $\eta$ are
strongly affected by the radial dependence of $\sigma$ and mean stellar mass
and the relationship between $\eta$ and $\delta_\alpha$ depends mainly on the
cluster's initial conditions and the tidal field. Within $r_m$, where these
effects are minimized, we find that $\eta$ and $\delta_\alpha$ initially share
a linear relationship. However, once the degree of mass segregation increases
such that the radial dependence of $\sigma$ and mean stellar mass become a
factor within $r_m$, or the cluster undergoes core collapse, the relationship
breaks down. We propose a method for determining $\eta$ within $r_m$ from an
observational measurement of $\delta_\alpha$. In cases where $\eta$ and
$\delta_\alpha$ can be measured independently, this new method offers a way of
measuring the cluster's dynamical state.

voltage-biased one-dimensional junction between a nontopological and a
topological superconductor for arbitrary junction transparency using the
scattering matrix formalism. We consider two representative models for the
topological superconductors: (i) spinful $p$-wave and (ii) $s$-wave with
spin-orbit coupling and spin splitting. We verify that in the tunneling limit
(small junction transparencies) where only single Andreev reflections
contribute to the current, the conductance for voltages below the
nontopological superconductor gap $\Delta_s$ is zero and there are two
symmetric conductance peaks appearing at $eV = \pm \Delta_s$ with the quantized
value $(4-\pi)2e^2/h$ due to resonant Andreev reflection from the Majorana zero
mode. However, when the junction transparency is not small, there is a finite
conductance for $e|V| < \Delta_s$ arising from multiple Andreev reflections.
The conductance at $eV = \pm \Delta_s$ in this case is no longer quantized. In
general, the conductance is particle-hole asymmetric except for sufficiently
small transparencies. We further show that, for certain values of parameters,
the tunneling conductance from a zero-energy conventional Andreev bound state
can be made to mimic the conductance from a true Majorana mode.

imply that the stellar mass to halo mass relation, which connects galaxies to

supernovae (SNe) 2005kd, 2006jd, and 2010jl, acquired with Chandra, XMM-Newton,
Suzaku, and Swift. Previous extensive X-ray studies of SN 2010jl have revealed
that X-ray spectra are dominated by thermal emission, which likely arises from
a hot plasma heated by a forward shock propagating into a massive circumstellar
medium (CSM). Interestingly, an additional soft X-ray component was required to
reproduce the spectra at a period of ~1-2 yr after the SN explosion. Although
this component is likely associated with the SN, its origin remained an open
question. We find a similar, additional soft X-ray component from the other two
SNe IIn as well. Given this finding, we present a new interpretation for the
origin of this component; it is thermal emission from a forward shock
essentially identical to the hard X-ray component, but directly reaches us from
a void of the dense CSM. Namely, the hard and soft components are responsible
for the heavily- and moderately-absorbed components, respectively. The
co-existence of the two components with distinct absorptions as well as the
delayed emergence of the moderately-absorbed X-ray component would be evidence
for asphericity of the CSM. We show that the X-ray spectral evolution can be
qualitatively explained by considering a torus-like geometry for the dense CSM.
Based on our X-ray spectral analyses, we estimate the radius of the torus-like
CSM to be on the order of ~5 times 10^{16} cm.

solar wind since 1990, relying on the assumption of axisymmetry about the mean
magnetic field, B0. However, several works indicate that this hypothesis might
be partially wrong, thus raising two questions: (i) is it correct to interpret
measurements at 1 AU (the so-called Maltese cross) in term of a sum of slab and
2D turbulence? (ii) what information is really contained in the Maltese cross?
  We solve direct numerical simulations of the MHD equations including the
transverse stretching exerted by the solar wind flow and study the genuine 3D
anisotropy of turbulence as well as that one resulting from the assumption of
axisymmetry about B0. We show that the evolution of the turbulent spectrum from
0.2 to 1 AU depends strongly on its initial anisotropy. An axisymmetric
spectrum with respect to B0 keeps its axisymmetry, i.e., resists stretching
perpendicular to radial, while an isotropic spectrum becomes essentially
axisymmetric with respect to the radial direction.
  We conclude that close to the Sun, slow-wind turbulence has a spectrum that
is axisymmetric around B0 and the measured 2D component at 1 AU describes the
real shape of turbulent structures. On the contrary, fast-wind turbulence has a
more isotropic spectrum at the source and becomes radially symmetric at 1 AU.
Such structure is hidden by the symmetrization applied to the data that instead
returns a slab geometry.

depends on the local density and velocity dispersion along the orbit of the Sun

migration of the solar orbit on the rate of stellar encounters. As a first step
we integrate the orbit of the Sun backwards in time in an analytical potential
of the Milky Way. We use the present-day phase-space coordinates of the Sun,
according to the measured uncertainties. The resulting orbits are inserted in
an N-body simulation of the Galaxy, where the stellar velocity dispersion is
calculated at each position along the orbit of the Sun. We compute the rate of
Galactic stellar encounters by employing three different solar orbits
---migrating from the inner disk, without any substantial migration, and
migrating from the outer disk. We find that the rate for encounters within
$4\times10^5$ AU from the Sun is approximately 21, 39 and 63 Myr$^{-1}$,
respectively. The stronger encounters establish the outer limit of the
so-called parking zone, which is the region in the plane of the orbital
eccentricities and semi-major axes where the planetesimals of the Solar system

the spacecraft. Here we present observations of the Chameleon I cluster whose
low declination makes it observable by the Spitzer space telescope over a 200

sample variability on timescales of months. We find such variability is common,

color over 200 days for many of the sources falls between that expected for
extinction and fluctuations in disk emission. With our high cadence and long
baseline we can derive power spectral density curves covering two orders of
magnitude in frequency and find significant power at low frequencies, up to the
boundaries of our 200 day survey. Such long timescales are difficult to explain
with variations driven by the interaction between the disk and stellar magnetic
field, which has a dynamical timescale of days to weeks. The most likely
explanation is either structural or temperature fluctuations spread throughout
the inner ~0.5 au of the disk, suggesting that the intrinsic dust structure is
highly dynamic.

unique spectral features and extreme dispersion generated by the phenomenon of
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). EIT is a destructive quantum
interference phenomenon experienced by atoms with multiple internal quantum
states when illuminated by laser fields with appropriate frequencies. By
detuning the lasers slightly from the ""dark resonance"", we observe that, within
the transparency window, atoms can be subject to a strong viscous force, while
being only slightly heated by the diffusion caused by spontaneous photon
scattering. In contrast to other laser cooling schemes, such as polarization
gradient cooling or EIT-sideband cooling, no external magnetic field or strong
external confining potential is required. Using a semiclassical approximation,
we derive analytically quantitative expressions for the steady-state
temperature, which is confirmed by full quantum mechanical numerical
simulations. We find that the lowest achievable temperatures approach the
single-photon recoil energy. In addition to dissipative forces, the atoms are
subject to a stationary conservative potential, leading to the possibility of
spatial confinement. We find that under typical experimental parameters this
effect is weak and stable trapping is not possible.

on the nature of relativistic interactions for spinning objects in the context
of the worldline formalism. It also potentially brings a dynamical explanation
for why massive fundamental objects are naturally of lowest spin. We analyze
first a non-relativistic system where spin is modeled as an entangled state of
two particles with the entanglement encoded into a set of constraints. It is
shown that these constraints can be made relativistic and that the resulting
description is isomorphic to the usual description of the phase space of
massive relativistic particles with the restriction that the quantum spin has

molecular clouds. In the simulations, no feedback is included, so all motions
are due either to the initial, decaying turbulence, or to gravitational
contraction. We define clumps as connected regions above a series of density
thresholds. The resultingfull set of clumps follows the generalized
energy-equipartition relation $\sigma_{v}/R^{1/2} \propto \Sigma^{1/2}$, where
$\sigma_{v}$ is the velocity dispersion, $R$ is the ""radius"", and $\Sigma$ is
the column density. We interpret this as a natural consequence of gravitational
contraction at all scales, rather than virial equilibrium. Nevertheless, clumps
with low $\Sigma$ tend to show a large scatter around equipartition. In more
than half of the cases, this scatter is dominated by external turbulent
compressions that {\it assemble} the clumps, rather than by small-scale random
motions that would disperse them. The other half does actually disperse.
Moreover, clump sub-samples selected by means of different criteria exhibit
different scalings. Sub-samples with narrow $\Sigma$ ranges follow Larson-like
relations, although characterized by their respective value of $\Sigma$.
Finally, we find that: i) clumps lying in filaments tend to appear sub-virial;
ii) high-density cores ($n \ge 10^5$ cm$^3$) that exhibit moderate kinetic
energy excesses often contain sink (""stellar"") particles, and the excess
disappears when the stellar mass is taken into account in the energy balance;
iii) cores with kinetic energy excess but no stellar particles are truly in a
state of dispersal.

includes tides in the affine approximation, where stars are modeled as
self-similar ellipsoidal polytropes, and GR corrections using the commonly-used
post-Newtonian formalism. Using this numerical formalism, we are able resolve
the leading effect from tides and GR across several orders of magnitude in both
stellar radius and initial target binary separation. We find that the main
effect from tides is the formation of two-body tidal captures that form during
the chaotic and resonant evolution of the triple system. The two stars
undergoing the capture spiral in and merge. The inclusion of tides can thus
lead to an increase on the stellar coalescence rate. We also develop an
analytical framework for calculating the cross section of tidal inspirals
between any pair of objects with similar mass. From our analytical and
numerical estimates we find that the rate of tidal inspirals relative to
collisions increases as the initial semi-major axis of the target binary
increases and the radius of the interacting tidal objects decreases. The
largest effect is therefore found for triple systems hosting white dwarfs and
neutron stars. In this case, we find the rate of highly eccentric white dwarf -
neutron star mergers to likely be dominated by tidal inspirals. While tidal
inspirals occur rarely, we note that they can give rise to a plethora of
thermonuclear transients such as Ca-rich transients.

Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code. We show that the
evolution of the internal entropy depends on the contrast between the internal
adiabat and the entropy of the accreted material, parametrized by the shock
temperature $T_0$ and pressure $P_0$. At low temperatures ($T_0\lesssim
300$--$1000\ {\rm K}$, depending on model parameters), the accreted material
has a lower entropy than the interior. The convection zone extends to the
surface and can drive a large luminosity, leading to rapid cooling and cold
starts. For higher temperatures, the accreted material has a larger entropy
than the interior, giving a radiative zone that stalls cooling. For $T_0\gtrsim
2000\ {\rm K}$, the surface--interior entropy contrast cannot be accommodated
by the radiative envelope, and the accreted matter accumulates with high
entropy, forming a hot start. The final state of the planet depends on the
shock temperature, accretion rate, and starting entropy at the onset of runaway
accretion. Cold starts with $L\lesssim 5\times 10^{-6}\ L_\odot$ require low
accretion rates and starting entropy, and that the temperature of the accreting
material is maintained close to the nebula temperature. If instead the
temperature is near the value required to radiate the accretion luminosity,
$4\pi R^2\sigma T_0^4\sim (GM\dot M/R)$, as suggested by previous work on

also characterised by a quantized and unbounded magnetic dipole moment parallel
to their propagation direction, as they possess a net charge of

nanoscale holograms designed to introduce astigmatism onto the electron
wavefunctions and spatially separate its phase components. We sort pure and
superposition OAM states of electrons ranging within OAM values of $-10$ and
$10$. We employ the device to analyze the OAM spectrum of electrons having been
affected by a micron-scale magnetic dipole, thus establishing that, with a

broad technological appeal. It allows one to control the spin dynamics on a
femtosecond time scale. The discipline, commonly called femtomagnetism, started
with the pioneering experiment by Beaurepaire and coworkers in 1996, who showed
subpicosecond demagnetization occurs in magnetic Ni thin films. This finding
has motivated extensive research worldwide. All-optical helicity-dependent spin
switching (AOS) represents a new frontier in femtomagnetism, where a single
ultrafast laser pulse can permanently switch spin without any assistance from a
magnetic field. This review summarizes some of the crucial aspects of this new
discipline: key experimental findings, leading mechanisms, controversial
issues, and possible future directions. The emphasis is on our latest
investigation. We first develop the all-optical spin switching rule that
determines how the switchability depends on the light helicity. This rule
allows one to understand microscopically how the spin is reversed and why the
circularly polarized light appears more powerful than the linearly polarized
light. Then we invoke our latest spin-orbit coupled harmonic oscillator model
to simulate single spin reversal. We consider both cw excitation and pulsed
laser excitation. The results are in a good agreement with the experimental
result. We then extend the code to include the exchange interaction among
different spin sites. We show where the ""inverse Faraday field"" comes from and
how the laser affects the spin reversal nonlinearly. Our hope is that this
review will motivate new experimental and theoretical investigations and
discussions.

here we demonstrate that biophysical modeling has the potential to break the

allocation---exchangeability implies the existence of both a de Finetti
representation and an exchangeable partition probability function (EPPF),
distributional representations useful for computational and theoretical
purposes. In this work, we develop the analogous de Finetti representation and
exchangeable trait probability function (ETPF) for trait allocations, along
with a characterization of all trait allocations with an ETPF. Unlike previous
feature allocation characterizations, our proofs fully capture
single-occurrence ""dust"" groups. We further introduce a novel constrained
version of the ETPF that we use to establish an intuitive connection between
the probability functions for clustering, feature allocations, and trait
allocations. As an application of our general theory, we characterize the
distribution of all edge-exchangeable graphs, a class of recently-developed
models that captures realistic sparse graph sequences.

the secondary photons are produced outside the source through high energy
protons interaction with the background photons along the line of sight. We
apply the model to a characteristic case was the very high energy (VHE)

Talbot effects. We show that the image contrast is maximum when the source is
either a plane wave or a point source, and it has a minimum for a source with
finite spatial extent. We compare these regimes and address some of their
fundamental differences. Specifically, we prove that increasing the source
divergence reduces the contrast for the plane wave illumination but increases
it for the point source. Also, we show that to achieve high contrast with a
point source, tuning the source size and its distance to the element is
crucial.We furthermore indicate and explore the possibility of realizing highly
complex light patterns by using a periodic transmission element. These patterns
can have more spots in the far field than the number of diffraction orders of
the periodic element. We predict that the ultimate image contrast is smaller
for a point source compared to a plane wave. Our simulations confirm that the
smallest achievable spot size in the image is imposed by diffraction regardless
of the imaging regime. Our research can be applied to similar domains e.g.

systems. In order to predict user actions such as the next product to purchase,
movie to watch, or place to visit, it is essential to take into account both
long-term user preferences and sequential patterns (i.e., short-term dynamics).
Matrix Factorization and Markov Chain methods have emerged as two separate but
powerful paradigms for modeling the two respectively. Combining these ideas has
led to unified methods that accommodate long- and short-term dynamics
simultaneously by modeling pairwise user-item and item-item interactions.
  In spite of the success of such methods for tackling dense data, they are
challenged by sparsity issues, which are prevalent in real-world datasets. In
recent years, similarity-based methods have been proposed for
(sequentially-unaware) item recommendation with promising results on sparse
datasets. In this paper, we propose to fuse such methods with Markov Chains to
make personalized sequential recommendations. We evaluate our method, Fossil,
on a variety of large, real-world datasets. We show quantitatively that Fossil
outperforms alternative algorithms, especially on sparse datasets, and

  The main contribution of this work is a new, high-performance parallel
computational framework for a broad class of NMF algorithms that iteratively
solves alternating non-negative least squares (NLS) subproblems for $W$ and
$H$. It maintains the data and factor matrices in memory (distributed across

provably minimizes communication costs (under mild assumptions). The framework
is flexible and able to leverage a variety of NMF and NLS algorithms, including
Multiplicative Update, Hierarchical Alternating Least Squares, and Block

different algorithms on massive dense and sparse data matrices of size that

Contrary to the conventional relay networks, we consider the scenario that the
relay is an energy harvesting (EH) node and has no embedded energy supply. But
it is equipped with a rechargeable battery such that it can harvest and
accumulate the harvested energy from RF signals sent by the source and
co-channel interferers to support its operation. Leveraging the inherent
feature of the considered system, we develop a novel accumulate-then-forward
(ATF) protocol to eliminate the harmful effect of CCI. In the proposed ATF
scheme, at the beginning of each transmission block, the relay can choose
either EH operation to harvest energy from source and CCI or information
decoding (ID) operation to decode and forward source's information while
suffering from CCI. Specifically, ID operation is activated only when the
accumulated energy at the relay can support an outage-free transmission in the
second hop. Otherwise, EH operation is invoked at the relay to harvest and
accumulate energy. By modeling the finite-capacity battery of relay as a
finite-state Markov Chain (MC), we derive a closed-form expression for the
system throughput of the proposed ATF scheme over mixed Nakagami-m and Rayleigh
fading channels. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis, and show
that the proposed ATF scheme with energy accumulation significantly outperforms
the existing one without energy accumulation.

of metallicity, mass ratio of primary to secondary, tidal enhancement
efficiency and helium abundance on the formation of blue hook (BHk) stars in
globular clusters (GCs). A total of 28 sets of binary models combined with
different input parameters are studied. For each set of binary model, we
presented a range of initial orbital periods that is needed to produce BHk
stars in binaries. All the binary models could produce BHk stars within
different range of initial orbital periods. We also compared our results with
the observation in the Teff-logg diagram of GC NGC 2808 and {\omega} Cen. Most
of the BHk stars in these two GCs locate well in the region predicted by our
theoretical models, especially when C/N-enhanced model atmospheres are
considered. We found that mass ratio of primary to secondary and tidal
enhancement efficiency have little effects on the formation of BHk stars in
binaries, while metallicity and helium abundance would play important roles,
especially for helium abundance. Specifically, with helium abundance increasing
in binary models, the space range of initial orbital periods needed to produce
BHk stars becomes obviously wider, regardless of other input parameters
adopted. Our results were discussed with recent observations and other
theoretical models.

approximate Bayesian inference based on a likelihood approximation derived from

containing a term with the electromagnetic potential vector coupled to the

generalizations of classical NP-hard combinatorial problems modeled as 0-1

other interval data min-max regret problems, as solely computing the cost of
any feasible solution requires solving an instance of an NP-hard problem. The
state-of-the-art exact algorithms in the literature are based on the generation
of a possibly exponential number of cuts. As each cut separation involves the
resolution of an NP-hard classical optimization problem, the size of the

issue, we present a modeling technique for interval robust-hard problems in the
context of a heuristic framework. The heuristic obtains feasible solutions by
exploring dual information of a linearly relaxed model associated with the

show analytically that the optimal external field (i.e., that which maximizes

high-degree nodes at high temperatures to counterintuitively focusing on
""loosely-connected"" nodes, which are weakly energetically bound to the ground
state, at low temperatures. We also present a novel and efficient algorithm for

to multidecadal timescales is investigated in a millennial control run of CCSM4
and in observations using a family of modes recovered in Part~I of this work
from unprocessed SST data through nonlinear Laplacian spectral analysis (NLSA).
It is found that ENSO and combination modes of ENSO with the annual cycle
exhibit a seasonally synchronized southward shift of equatorial surface zonal
winds and thermocline adjustment consistent with terminating El Nino and La
Nina events. The surface wind patterns associated with these modes also
generate teleconnections between the Pacific and Indian Oceans, leading to a
pattern of SST anomalies characteristic of the Indian Ocean dipole. Fundamental
and combination modes representing the tropospheric biennial oscillation (TBO)
in CCSM4 are also found to be consistent with mechanisms for seasonally
synchronized biennial variability of the Asian-Australian monsoon and Walker
circulation. On longer timescales, the leading multidecadal pattern recovered
by NLSA from Indo-Pacific SST data in CCSM4, referred to as west Pacific
multidecadal mode (WPMM), is found to significantly modulate ENSO and TBO
activity with periods of negative SST anomalies in the western tropical Pacific
favoring stronger ENSO and TBO variability. Physically, this behavior is
attributed to the fact that cold WPMM phases feature anomalous decadal
westerlies in the tropical central Pacific and easterlies in the tropical
Indian Ocean, as well as an anomalously deep thermocline in the eastern Pacific
cold tongue. Moreover, despite the relatively low SST variance explained by
this mode, the WPMM is found to correlate significantly with decadal
precipitation over Australia in CCSM4.

quantum nonlocality can be used to efficiently detect the quantum critical

first derivative of quantum correlation approaches infinity and the critical
point is reached as the size of the model increases. Furthermore, we discuss
the quantum correlation distribution in this model based on square of
concurrence (SC) and square of quantum discord (SQD). The monogamous properties
of SC and SQD are obtained for the present system. We finally reveal that the
monogamy score can be used to capture the quantum critical point.

entanglement) in these multi-channel multi-photon input states. Due to the
prevalence of quantum correlations in the quantum regime, the results presented
in this paper are very general. Moreover, the multi-channel multi-photon states
studied here are reasonably mathematically tractable. Three types of
multi-photon states are considered: 1) $m$ photons superposed among $m$
channels, 2) $N$ photons superposed among $m$ channels where $N\geq m$, and 3)
$N$ photons superposed among $m$ channels where $N$ is an arbitrary positive
integer. Formulae for intensities and states of output fields are derived.

regulation of gene expression and how this mode of regulation differs from
transcriptional regulation.In E.coli, in the presence of oxidative stress, the
synthesis of sigma^s is regulated through an interesting mechanism involving
both transcriptional and sRNA-mediated translational regulation. The key
regulatory factors involved in transcriptional and translational regulation are
ArcA and ArcB proteins and ArcZ sRNA, respectively. Phosphorylated ArcA, in a
feedforward mechanism, represses the transcriptions sigma^s and ArcZ sRNA with
the latter being a post-transcriptional activator for sigma^s. Through a
feedback mechanisms, ArcZ sRNA destabilises ArcB mRNA and regulates the level
of ArcB protein, a kinase that phosphorylates ArcA. The oxygen and energy
availability is expected to influence the ArcA phosphorylation rate and, as a
consequence, in equilibrium, the system is likely to be in either a high ArcB
(low ArcZ) or a low ArcB (high ArcZ) state. Kinetic modelling studies suggest
that the rate of destabilisation of ArcB mRNA by ArcZ sRNA must be
appropriately tuned for achieving the desired state. In particular, for a high
phosphorylation rate, the transition from a low to a high ArcZ synthesis regime
with the increase in sRNA-mRNA interaction is similar to the threshold-linear
response observed earlier. Further, we show that the mRNA destabilisation by
sRNA might be, in particular, beneficial in the low phosphorylation state for
having the right concentration levels of ArcZ and ArcB. Stochastic simulation
results suggest that as the ArcZ-ArcB binding affinity is increased, the
probability distribution for the number of ArcZ molecules becomes flatter
indicating frequently occurring transcriptional bursts of varying strengths.

graphene geometries of varying complexity, from mono-ribbons to junctions, with
spatial resolution at the diffraction limit and a projected sensitivity to

communication widgets to versatile computing devices. Proliferation of these
hand held devices has made them a common means to access and process digital
information. Most web based applications are today available in a form that can
conveniently be accessed over mobile devices. However, webservices
(applications meant for consumption by other applications rather than humans)
are not as commonly provided and consumed over mobile devices. Facilitating
this and in effect realizing a service-oriented system over mobile devices has
the potential to further enhance the potential of mobile devices. One of the
major challenges in this integration is the lack of an efficient service
registry system that caters to issues associated with the dynamic and volatile
mobile environments. Existing service registry technologies designed for
traditional systems fall short of accommodating such issues. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach to manage service registry systems provided 'solely'
over mobile devices, and thus realising an SOA without the need for high-end
computing systems. The approach manages a dynamic service registry system in
the form of light weight and distributed registries. We assess the feasibility
of our approach by engineering and deploying a working prototype of the
proposed registry system over actual mobile devices. A comparative study of the
proposed approach and the traditional UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery,
and Integration) registry is also included. The evaluation of our framework has
shown propitious results in terms of battery cost, scalability, hindrance with
native applications.

efficiency within the bandwidth is almost constant, which is favorable for
short pulses. We demonstrate both analytically and numerically an ""area law""
for the frequency conversion, i.e. the product of bandwidth and efficiency is
conserved as long as peak conversion efficiency does not saturate. The
adiabatic structure shows higher saturation thresholds in pump power or
interaction length, outperforming the conventional uniform waveguide design.
With our approach, high-efficiency and wavefront-keeping conversion for short

scalable on-chip information processing.

the key elements of user behaviors for evaluating credibility are concluded as

correlation among different key elements during the spreading of microblogs. In
this paper, we propose a novel representation learning method, Information
Credibility Evaluation (ICE), to learn representations of information
credibility on social media. In ICE, latent representations are learnt for
modeling user credibility, behavior types, temporal properties, and comment
attitudes. The aggregation of these factors in the microblog spreading process
yields the representation of a user's behavior, and the aggregation of these
dynamic representations generates the credibility representation of an event
spreading on social media. Moreover, a pairwise learning method is applied to
maximize the credibility difference between rumors and non-rumors. To evaluate
the performance of ICE, we conduct experiments on a Sina Weibo data set, and
the experimental results show that our ICE model outperforms the

supposedly created by a circulating carousel of sub-beams, can produce the
driftbands demonstrated by PSR J0815+09, and more recently PSR B1839-04, which
simultaneously drift in opposing directions. Here we suggest that the carousels
of these pulsars, and hence their beams, are not circular but elliptical with
axes tilted with respect to the fiducial plane. We show that certain relatively
unusual lines of sight can cause bi-drifting to be observed, and a simulation
of the two known exemplars is presented. Although bi-drifting is rare,
non-circular beams may be common among pulsars and reveal themselves by having
profile centroids displaced from the fiducial plane identified by polarisation
position angle swings. They may also result in profiles with asymmetric and
frequency-dependent component evolution. It is further suggested that the
carousels may change their tilt by specific amounts and later reverse them.
This may occur suddenly, accompanying a mode change (e.g. PSR B0943+10), or
more gradually and short-lived as in ""flare"" pulsars (e.g. PSR B1859+07). A
range of pulsar behaviour (e.g. the shifting drift patterns of PSRs B0818-41

orientation. The underlying nature of these carousels - whether they are
exclusively generated by polar cap physics or driven by magnetospheric effects

for satellites to form, and provide observational signatures of young forming
planets. We have carried out two dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with
radiative cooling to study CPDs, and suggested a new mechanism to drive the
disk accretion. Two spiral shocks are present in CPDs, excited by the central
star. We find that spiral shocks can at least contribute to, if not dominate
the angular momentum transport and energy dissipation in CPDs. Meanwhile,
dissipation and heating by spiral shocks have a positive feedback on
shock-driven accretion itself. As the disk is heated up by spiral shocks, the
shocks become more open, leading to more efficient angular momentum transport.
This shock driven accretion is, on the other hand, unsteady on a timescale of
months/years due to production and destruction of vortices in disks. After
being averaged over time, a quasi-steady accretion is reached from the planet's
Hill radius all the way to the planet surface, and the disk
$\alpha$-coefficient characterizing angular momentum transport due to spiral
shocks is $\sim$0.001-0.02. The disk surface density ranges from 10 to 1000 g
cm$^{-2}$ in our simulations, which is at least 3 orders of magnitude smaller
than the ""minimum mass sub-nebula"" model used to study satellite formation;
instead it is more consistent with the ""gas-starved"" satellite formation model.
Finally, we calculate the millimeter flux emitted by CPDs at ALMA and EVLA
wavelength bands and predict the flux for several recently discovered CPD
candidates, which suggests that ALMA is capable of discovering these accreting
CPDs.

infinite-dimensional covariance operators of input features in the paradigm of
kernel methods on infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. Our formulation
provides in particular a rich representation of image features by exploiting
their non-linear correlations. Theoretically, we provide a finite-dimensional
approximation of the Log-Hilbert-Schmidt (Log-HS) distance between covariance
operators that is scalable to large datasets, while maintaining an effective
discriminating capability. This allows us to efficiently approximate any
continuous shift-invariant kernel defined using the Log-HS distance. At the
same time, we prove that the Log-HS inner product between covariance operators
is only approximable by its finite-dimensional counterpart in a very limited
scenario. Consequently, kernels defined using the Log-HS inner product, such as
polynomial kernels, are not scalable in the same way as shift-invariant
kernels. Computationally, we apply the approximate Log-HS distance formulation
to covariance operators of both handcrafted and convolutional features,
exploiting both the expressiveness of these features and the power of the

brightness-temperature fluctuations from 21cm intensity mapping, demonstrating
that the dipole may be measured at modest significance ($\lesssim 2\sigma$) by
combining the upcoming radio survey CHIME with the future redshift surveys of
DESI and Euclid. More significant measurements ($\lesssim~10\sigma$) will be
possible by combining intensity maps from the SKA with these of DESI or Euclid,
and an even higher significance measurement ($\lesssim 100\sigma$) may be made
by combining observables completely internally to the SKA. We account for
effects such as contamination by wide-angle terms, interferometer noise and
beams in the intensity maps, non-linear enhancements to the power spectrum,
stacking multiple populations, sensitivity to the magnification slope, and the
possibility that number counts and intensity maps probe the same tracers. We
also derive a new expression for the covariance matrix of multi-tracer
redshift-space correlation function estimators with arbitrary orientation
weights, which may be useful for upcoming surveys aiming at measuring
redshift-space clustering with multiple tracers.

$\omega=(\omega(t))_{t\ge0}$ denote the corresponding monotone L\'evy noise.. A

non-commutative $L^2$-space $L^2(\tau)$ that has the form $\sum_{i=0}^n\langle
\omega^{\otimes i},f^{(i)}\rangle$, where $f^{(i)}\in C_0(\mathbb R_+^i)$. We
denote by $\mathbf{CP}$ the space of all continuous polynomials of $\omega$.
For $f^{(n)}\in C_0(\mathbb R_+^n)$, the orthogonal polynomial $\langle

monomial $\langle\omega^{\otimes n},f^{(n)}\rangle$ onto the subspace of

order $\le n-1$. We denote by $\mathbf{OCP}$ the linear span of the orthogonal

$f^{(n)}$ to the set $\{(t_1,\dots,t_n)\in\mathbb R_+^n\mid t_1\ge

unitary operator $J:L^2(\tau)\to\mathbb F$, where $\mathbb F$ is an extended
monotone Fock space. Thus, we may think of the monotone noise $\omega$ as a
distribution of linear operators acting in $\mathbb F$. We say that the
orthogonal polynomials belong to the Meixner class if
$\mathbf{CP}=\mathbf{OCP}$. We prove that each system of orthogonal polynomials
from the Meixner class is characterized by two parameters: $\lambda\in\mathbb
R$ and $\eta\ge0$. In this case, the monotone L\'evy noise has the
representation
$\omega(t)=\partial_t^\dag+\lambda\partial_t^\dag\partial_t+\partial_t+\eta\partial_t^\dag\partial_t\partial_t$.

brightness variations has led to several periods from $P=212^{d}$ to
$P=320^{d}$ in different time intervals. We have found the period $P=237^{d}$
based on our infrared photometry. The variability amplitude, the light-curve
shape, and the magnitude of V1027~Cyg at maximum light change noticeably from
cycle to cycle. An ambiguous correlation of the $B-V$ and $U-B$ colors with the
brightness has been revealed. The spectral energy distribution for V1027~Cyg
from our photometry in the range 0.36 ($U$)-5.0 ($M$) $\mu$m corresponds to
spectral types from G8I to K3I at different phases of the pulsation cycle.
Low-resolution spectra of V1027 Cyg in the range $\lambda$4400--9200 \AA\ were
taken during 16 nights over the period 1995--2015. At the 1995 and 2011
photometric minima the star's spectrum exhibited molecular TiO bands whose
intensity corresponded to spectral types M0--M1, while the photometric data
point to a considerably earlier spectral type. We hypothesize that the TiO
bands are formed in the upper layers of the extended stellar atmosphere. We
have measured the equivalent widths of the strongest absorption lines, in
particular, the infrared Ca~II triplet in the spectrum of V1027~Cyg. The
calcium triplet (Ca T) with $W_{\lambda}(\mathrm{Ca~T})=20.3\pm1.8$ \AA\ as a
luminosity indicator for supergiants places V1027 Cyg in the region of the
brightest G--K supergiants. V1027 Cyg has been identified with the infrared

first rescaled to its own time scale so as to put all sampled trajectories in
phase in a common virtual time line. Principal component analysis is introduced
to compress the information contained in these transformed trajectories and
sparse PCE representations using least angle regression are finally used to
approximate the components. The approach shows remarkably small prediction
error for particular trajectories as well as for second-order statistics of the
latter. It is illustrated on different benchmark problems well known in the
literature on time-dependent PCE problems, ranging from rigid body dynamics,
chemical reactions to forced oscillations of a non linear system.

two-time-scale formulation. Distinct from the work in the existing literature,
the systems are driven by $\alpha$-stable processes with $\alpha \in(1,2)$. In
addition, the SPDEs are either modulated by a continuous-time Markov chain with
a finite state space or have an addition fast jump component. The inclusion of
the Markov chain is for the needs of treating random environment, whereas the
addition of the fast jump process enables the consideration of discontinuity in
the sample paths of the fast processes. Assuming either a fast changing Markov
switching or an additional fast-varying jump process, this work aims to obtain
the averaging principles for such systems. There are several distinct
difficulties. First, the noise is not square integrable. Second, in our setup,
for the underlying SPDE, there is only a unique mild solution and as a result,
there is only mild It\^{o}'s formula that can be used. Moreover, another new
aspect is the addition of the fast regime switching and the addition of the
fast varying jump processes in the formulation, which enlarges the
applicability of the underlying systems. To overcome these difficulties, a
semigroup approach is taken. Under suitable conditions, it is proved that the
$p$th moment convergence takes place with $p\in(1,\alpha )$, which is stronger
than the usual weak convergence approaches.

rapid evaluation of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in a mesoscopic sample

developed a multiscale magnetization dynamics simulation approach that can be
applied to large systems with spin structures that vary locally on small length
scales. To implement this, the conventional micromagnetic simulation framework
has been expanded to include a multiscale solving routine. The software
selectively simulates different regions of a ferromagnetic sample according to
the spin structures located within in order to employ a suitable discretization
and use either a micromagnetic or an atomistic model. To demonstrate the
validity of the multiscale approach, we simulate the spin wave transmission
across the regions simulated with the two different models and different
discretizations. We find that the interface between the regions is fully
transparent for spin waves with frequency lower than a certain threshold set by
the coarse scale micromagnetic model with no noticeable attenuation due to the
interface between the models. As a comparison to exact analytical theory, we
show that in a system with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction leading to spin
spiral, the simulated multiscale result is in good quantitative agreement with
the analytical calculation.

introduced a framework based on dynamic programming to make applications of the
protrusion replacement technique constructive and to obtain explicit upper
bounds on the involved constants. They show that for several graph problems,
for every boundary size $t$ one can find an explicit set $\mathcal{R}_t$ of
representatives. Any subgraph $H$ with a boundary of size $t$ can be replaced
with a representative $H' \in \mathcal{R}_t$ such that the effect of this
replacement on the optimum can be deduced from $H$ and $H'$ alone. Their upper
bounds on the size of the graphs in $\mathcal{R}_t$ grow triple-exponentially
with $t$. In this paper we complement their results by lower bounds on the
sizes of representatives, in terms of the boundary size $t$. For example, we
show that each set of planar representatives $\mathcal{R}_t$ for Independent
Set or Dominating Set contains a graph with $\Omega(2^t / \sqrt{4t})$ vertices.
This lower bound even holds for sets that only represent the planar subgraphs
of bounded pathwidth. To obtain our results we provide a lower bound on the
number of equivalence classes of the canonical equivalence relation for
Independent Set on $t$-boundaried graphs. We also find an elegant
characterization of the number of equivalence classes in general graphs, in
terms of the number of monotone functions of a certain kind. Our results show
that the number of equivalence classes is at most $2^{2^t}$, improving on
earlier bounds of the form $(t+1)^{2^t}$.

perturbation of about $1.1\pm0.1$ K, in agreement with previous studies. We
discover an east-west anisotropy, with a slightly deeper intensity minimum east

excess is larger 8 hours before the reference time (the time of maximum
outflow), while it has almost disappeared 8 hours after the reference time. In

benchmark results of the SGE for the development of modern quantum physics and
chemistry.
  The SGE provided the first direct experimental evidence for angular momentum
quantization in the quantum world and thus also for the existence of
directional quantization of all angular momenta in the process of measurement.
It measured for the first time a ground state property of an atom, it produced
for the first time a `spin-polarized' atomic beam, it almost revealed the
electron spin. The SGE was the first fully successful molecular beam experiment
with high momentum-resolution by beam measurements in vacuum. This technique
provided a new kinematic microscope with which inner atomic or nuclear
properties could be investigated.
  The original SGE is described together with early attempts by Einstein,
Ehrenfest, Heisenberg, and others to understand directional quantization in the
SGE. Heisenberg's and Einstein's proposals of an improved multi-stage SGE are
presented. The first realization of these proposals by Stern, Phipps, Frisch
and Segr\`e is described. The set-up suggested by Einstein can be considered an
anticipation of a Rabi-apparatus. Recent theoretical work is mentioned in which
the directional quantization process and possible interference effects of the
two different spin states are investigated.
  In full agreement with the results of the new quantum theory directional
quantization appears as a general and universal feature of quantum
measurements. One experimental example for such directional quantization in
scattering processes is shown. Last not least, the early history of the
`almost' discovery of the electron spin in the SGE is revisited.

the hypergeometric mirror maps with rational parameters. In this paper, we
develop a systematic theory on the N-integrality of the hypergeometric series

present two equivalent statements for the hypergeometric series with parameters

introducing a new function that extends the Christol's function and developing
a further $p$-adic analysis, we establish a criterion for the N-integrality of

at different scales of masses, from microquasars up to the active galactic

magnetic field action. In addition, accretion disks at high Eddington rates can
be radiation-pressure dominated and, according to some of the heating
prescriptions, thermally unstable. The observational verification of their
resulting variability patterns may shed light on both the role of radiation
pressure and magnetic fields. We compute the structure and time evolution of an
accretion disk, using the code GLADIS (which models the global accretion disk
instability). We supplement this model with a modified viscosity prescription,
which can to some extent describe the magnetisation of the disk. We study the
results for a large grid of models, to cover the whole parameter space, and we
derive conclusions separately for different scales of black hole masses, which
are characteristic for various types of cosmic sources. We show the
dependencies between the flare or outburst duration, its amplitude, and period,
on the accretion rate and viscosity scaling. We show that if the heating rate
in the accretion disk grows more rapidly with the total pressure and
temperature, the instability results in longer and sharper flares. In general,
we confirm that the disks around the supermassive black holes are more
radiation-pressure dominated and present relatively brighter bursts. Our method
can also be used as an independent tool for the black hole mass determination,
which we confront now for the intermediate black hole in the source HLX-1.

the simulation of time dependent processes like phase transitions of

experimental spectra are compared with standard harmonic calculations, and
anharmonic calculations using a modified version of the SPECTRO program that
incorporates a Fermi resonance treatment utilizing intensity redistribution. We
show that the 3 {\mu}m region is dominated by the effects of anharmonicity,
resulting in many more bands than would have been expected in a purely harmonic
approximation. Importantly, we find that anharmonic spectra as calculated by
SPECTRO are in good agreement with the experimental spectra. Together with
previously reported high-resolution spectra of linear acenes, the present
spectra provide us with an extensive dataset of spectra of PAHs with a varying

highly-condensed structures, and featuring CH groups in all possible edge
configurations. We discuss the astrophysical implications of the comparison of

a close statistical relationship with the time of day, viz., ventricular
fibrillation is most likely to occur between 12 am-6 am, with 6 pm-12 am being
the next most likely period. Consequently there has been significant interest
in understanding how cardiac activity is influenced by the circadian clock,
i.e., temporal oscillations in physiological activity with a period close to 24
hours and synchronized with the day-night cycle. Although studies have
identified the genetic basis of circadian rhythms at the intracellular level,
the mechanisms by which they influence cardiac pathologies are not yet fully
understood. Evidence has suggested that diurnal variations in the conductance
properties of ion channel proteins that govern the excitation dynamics of
cardiac cells may provide the crucial link. In this paper, we investigate the
relationship between the circadian rhythm as manifested in modulations of ion
channel properties and the susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias by using a
mathematical model that describes electrical activity in ventricular tissue. We
show that changes in the channel conductance that lead to extreme values for
the duration of action potentials in cardiac cells can result either in
abnormally high-frequency reentrant activity or spontaneous conduction block of
excitation waves. Both phenomena increase the likelihood of wavebreaks that are
known to initiate potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. Thus, disruptive
cardiac excitation dynamics are most likely to occur in time-intervals of the
day-night cycle during which the channel properties are closest to these
extreme values, providing an intriguing relation between circadian rhythms and
cardiac pathologies.

The latter is particularly important for today's multi- and many-core systems.
However, writing such efficient code is highly complex and error-prone. In this

model claims to hide the aforementioned complexities from the programmer, but
deliver locality-aware remote-memory-access semantics which outperforms MPI-3
one-sided communication primitives on multi-core systems. Conceptually, the
DART-MPI interface is simple; at the same time it takes care of the
complexities of the underlying MPI-3 and system topology. This makes DART-MPI
an interesting candidate for porting legacy applications. We evaluate these
claims using a realistic scientific application, specifically a

In this paper, using the so-called ""clean numerical simulation"" (CNS) whose

Burst (GRB) may suffer ozone depletion, potentially causing a mass extinction
event to existing life on a planet's surface and oceans. We model the dangers
of long GRBs to planets in the Milky Way and utilize a static statistical model
of the Galaxy that matches major observable properties, such as the inside-out
star formation history, metallicity evolution, and 3-dimensional stellar number
density distribution. The GRB formation rate is a function of both the star
formation history and metallicity; however, the extent to which chemical
evolution reduces the GRB rate over time in the Milky Way is still an open
question. Therefore, we compare the damaging effects of GRBs to biospheres in
the Milky Way using two models. One model generates GRBs as a function of the
inside-out star formation history. The other model follows the star formation
history, but generates GRB progenitors as a function of metallicity, thereby
favoring metal-poor host regions of the Galaxy over time. If the GRB rate only
follows the star formation history, the majority of the GRBs occur in the inner
Galaxy. However, if GRB progenitors are constrained to low metallicity
environments, then GRBs only form in the metal-poor outskirts at recent epochs.
Interestingly, over the past 1 Gyr, the surface density of stars (and their
corresponding planets) that survive a GRB is still greatest in the inner galaxy
in both models. The present day danger of long GRBs to life at the solar radius
($R_\odot=8$ kpc) is low. We find that at least $\sim$65% of stars survive a
GRB over the past 1 Gyr. Furthermore, when the GRB rate was expected to have
been enhanced at higher redshifts, such as $z\gtrsim0.5$, our results suggest
that a large fraction of planets would have survived these lethal GRB events.

As demonstrated in prior work, physical properties of keystroke sounds might

strong adversary models that are not very practical in many real-world

victim, (ii) precise profiling of the victim's typing style and keyboard,
and/or (iii) significant amount of victim's typed information (and its
corresponding sounds) available to the adversary.
  This paper presents and explores a new keyboard acoustic eavesdropping attack
that involves Voice-over-IP (VoIP), called Skype & Type (S&T), while avoiding
prior strong adversary assumptions. This work is motivated by the simple
observation that people often engage in secondary activities (including typing)
while participating in VoIP calls. As expected, VoIP software acquires and
faithfully transmits all sounds, including emanations of pressed keystrokes,
which can include passwords and other sensitive information. We show that one
very popular VoIP software (Skype) conveys enough audio information to
reconstruct the victim's input -- keystrokes typed on the remote keyboard. Our
results demonstrate that, given some knowledge on the victim's typing style and
keyboard model, the attacker attains top-5 accuracy of 91.7% in guessing a
random key pressed by the victim.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate that S&T is robust to various VoIP issues (e.g.,
Internet bandwidth fluctuations and presence of voice over keystrokes), thus
confirming feasibility of this attack. Finally, it applies to other popular
VoIP software, such as Google Hangouts.

[Ondruska, 2016], we employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture the

expected to be a primary source of low frequency gravitational waves. Yet in
isolated gas-free spherical stellar systems, the hardening of the binary stalls
at parsec-scale separations owing to the inefficiency of relaxation-driven
loss-cone refilling. Repopulation via collisionless orbit diffusion in triaxial
systems is more efficient, but published simulation results are contradictory.
While sustained hardening has been reported in simulations of galaxy mergers
with $N \sim 10^6$ stars and in early simulations of rotating models, in
isolated non-rotating triaxial models the hardening rate continues to fall with
increasing N, a signature of spurious two-body relaxation. We present a novel
approach for studying loss cone repopulation in galactic nuclei. Since loss
cone repopulation in triaxial systems owes to orbit diffusion, it is a purely
collisionless phenomenon and can be studied with an approximated force
calculation technique, provided the force errors are well behaved and
sufficiently small. We achieve this using an accurate fast multipole method and
define a proxy for the hardening rate that depends only on stellar angular
momenta. We find that the loss cone is efficiently replenished even in very
mildly triaxial models (with axis ratios 1 : 0.9 : 0.8). Such triaxiality is
unavoidable following galactic mergers and can drive binaries into the
gravitational wave regime. We conclude that there is no final parsec problem.

results are interpreted using two simplified models of supersymmetric particle

each gluino decays via a three-body process to top quarks and a neutralino,
which is associated with the observed missing transverse momentum in the event.
Gluinos with masses up to 1.6 TeV are excluded for neutralino masses below 600
GeV. In the second model, each gluino decays via a three-body process to two
light quarks and a chargino, which subsequently decays to a W boson and a
neutralino. The mass of the chargino is taken to be midway between the gluino

Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos measures including the measure of Bacry and Muzy
on the interval and circle as special cases. An exact, non-local functional
equation is derived for the derivative of a general functional of the total
mass of the measure with respect to intermittency. The formal solution is given
in the form of an intermittency expansion and proved to be a renormalized
expansion in the centered moments of the total mass of the measure. The full
intermittency expansion of the Mellin transform of the total mass is computed
in terms of the corresponding expansion of log-moments. The theory is shown to
extend to the dependence structure of the measure. For application, the
intermittency expansion of the Bacry-Muzy measure on the circle is computed
exactly, and the Morris integral probability distribution is shown to reproduce
the moments of the total mass and the intermittency expansion, resulting in the
conjecture that it is the distribution of the total mass. It is conjectured in
general that the intermittency expansion captures the distribution of the total
mass uniquely.

boils down to averaging the Laplace transform of the aggregate interference, a
benefit accorded at the expense of confinement to the simplistic Rayleigh
fading. In this work, to capture diverse fading channels that appear in
realistic outdoor/indoor wireless communication scenarios, we tackle the
problem differently. By exploting the moment generating function (MGF) of the
SINR, we succeed in analytically assessing cellular networks performance over
the shadowed {\kappa}-{\mu}, {\kappa}-{\mu} and {\eta}-{\mu} fading models. The
latter offer high flexibility by capturing diverse fading channels including
Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, Rician, and Rician shadow fading distributions. These
channel models have been recently praised for their capability to accurately
model dense urban environments, future femtocells and device-to-device (D2D)
shadowed channels. In addition to unifying the analysis for different channel
models, this work integrates, for the first time, the coverage, the achievable
rate, and the bit error probability (BEP), which are largely treated separately
in the literature. The developed model and analysis are validated over a broad

strongly on the domain size and the values of $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\lambda$;
when $\lambda$ is close to zero, the mean first exit time tends to $\infty$. In
particular, we also find an interesting result that the escape probability of a
particle with (tempered) power-law jumping length distribution has no relation
with the distribution of waiting times for the model considered in this paper.
For the solutions of the derived PDEs, the boundary layer phenomena are
observed, which inspires the motivation for developing the boundary layer
theory for nonlocal PDEs.

becomes obese and why. However, the processes that determine the changing shape
of Body Mass Index (BMI) distributions in high-income societies are not
well-understood. Here we establish the statistical mechanics of human weight
change, providing a fundamental new understanding of human weight
distributions. By compiling and analysing the largest data set so far of
year-over-year BMI changes, we find, strikingly, that heavy people on average
strongly decrease their weight year-over-year, and light people increase their
weight. This drift towards the centre of the BMI distribution is balanced by
diffusion resulting from random fluctuations in diet and physical activity that
are, notably, proportional in size to BMI. We formulate a stochastic
mathematical model for BMI dynamics, deriving a theoretical shape for the BMI
distribution and offering a mechanism to explain the ongoing right-skewed
broadening of BMI distributions over time. The model also provides new
quantitative support for the hypothesis that peer-to-peer social influence
plays a measurable role in BMI dynamics. More broadly, our results demonstrate
a remarkable analogy with drift-diffusion mechanisms that are well-known from
the physical sciences and finance.

spectroscopy in transmission mode. Carbon-based and iron-gall inks have been
studied, some prepared following ancient recipes and others using current
synthetic materials; a commercial ink was studied as well. We measured the THz
signals on thin film of liquid inks deposited on polyethylene pellicles,
comparing the results with the thick pellets of dried inks blended with
polyethylene powder. This study required the implementation of a new
experimental method and data analysis procedure able to provide a reliable
extraction of the material transmission parameters from a structured sample
composed of thin layers, down to thickness of few tens of micrometers. THz
measurements on thin ink layers enabled the determination of both the
absorption and the refractive index in an absolute scale in the 0.1 - 3 THz
range, as well as the layer thickness. THz spectroscopic features of a paper
sheet dyed by one of the iron-gall inks were also investigated. Our results
showed that THz time-domain spectroscopy enables to discriminate the various
inks on different supports, including the application on paper, together with a
proper determination of the absorption coefficients and indices of refraction.

based experiment with a wide band flux profile, to uncover the octant of the
leptonic mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ (i.e., $\theta_{23}$ is $< 45^\circ$ or
$>45^\circ$). In this work, we find that for the DUNE baseline of 1300 km, due
to enhanced matter effect, the neutrino and antineutrino probabilities are
different which creates a tension in the case of combined runs because of which
octant sensitivity also can come from disappearance channel. In view of this,
we study the physics of antineutrinos in DUNE and explore the role of
antineutrinos run that is required to resolve the octant degeneracy at a
certain confidence levels.

recently, mainly with respect to early detection of tsunamis as they travel at
near the speed of sound in water which makes them ideal candidates for early
detection of tsunamis. While the generation mechanisms of AGWs have been
studied from the perspective of vertical oscillations of seafloor and triad
wave-wave interaction, in the current study we are interested in their
generation by wave-structure interaction with possible implication to the
energy sector. Here, we develop two wavemaker theories to analyze different
wave modes generated by impermeable (the classic Havelock's theory) and porous
(porous wavemaker theory) plates in weakly compressible fluids. Slight
modification has been made to the porous theory so that, unlike the previous
theory, the new solution depends on the geometry of the plate. The expressions
for three different types of plates (piston, flap, delta-function) are
introduced. Analytical solutions are also derived for the potential amplitude
of the gravity, acoustic-gravity, evanescent waves, as well as the surface
elevation, velocity distribution, and pressure for AGWs. Both theories reduce
to previous results for incompressible flow when the compressibility is
neglected. We also show numerical examples for AGWs generated in a wave flume
as well as in deep ocean. Our current study sets the theoretical background
towards remote sensing by AGWs, for optimized deep ocean wave-power harnessing,
among others.
