systems, wherein an existing controller is modified in a minimally invasive
fashion to ensure safety. We build this framework through the use of control
barrier functions (CBFs) which guarantee forward invariance of a safe set;
these yield safety barrier certificates in the context of heterogeneous robot
dynamics subject to acceleration bounds. Moreover, safety barrier certificates
are extended to a distributed control framework, wherein neighboring agent
dynamics are unknown, through local parameter identification. The end result is
an optimization-based controller that formally guarantees collision free
behavior in heterogeneous multi-agent systems by minimally modifying the
desired controller via safety barrier constraints. This formal result is
verified in simulation on a multi-robot system consisting of both cumbersome
and agile robots, is demonstrated experimentally on a system with a Magellan
Pro robot and three Khepera III robots.

  with Application to TCP",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Closed-loop flow control protocols, such as the prominent implementation TCP,
are prevalent in the Internet, today. TCP has continuously been improved for
greedy traffic sources to achieve high throughput over networks with large
bandwidth delay products. Recently, the increasing use for streaming and
interactive applications, such as voice and video, has shifted the focus
towards its delay performance. Given the need for real-time communication of
non-greedy sources via TCP, we present an estimation method for performance
evaluation of closed-loop flow control protocols. We characterize an end-to-end
connection by a transfer function that provides statistical service guarantees
for arbitrary traffic. The estimation is based on end-to-end measurements at
the application level that include all effects induced by the network and by
the protocol stacks of the end systems. From our measurements, we identify
different causes for delays. We show that significant delays are due to
queueing in protocol stacks. Notably, this occurs even if the utilization is
moderate. Using our estimation method, we compare the impact of fundamental
mechanisms of TCP on delays at the application level: In detail, we analyze
parameters relevant for network dimensioning, including buffer provisioning and
active queue management, and parameters for server configuration, such as the
congestion control algorithm. By applying our method as a benchmark, we find
that a good selection can largely improve the delay performance of TCP.

to finding Wannier functions for ultracold atoms trapped in laser-generated

symmetric lattice with inversion symmetry, we construct Wannier functions as
eigen states of the position operators $\hat x$, $\hat y$ and $\hat z$
restricted to single-particle Bloch functions belonging to one or more bands.
To ensure that the Wannier functions are real-valued, we numerically obtain the
band structure and real-valued eigen states using a uniform Fourier grid DVR.
We then show by a comparison of tunneling energies, that the Wannier functions
are accurate for both inversion symmetric and asymmetric potentials to better
than ten significant digits when using double-precision arithmetic. The
calculations are performed for an optical lattice with double-wells per unit
cell with tunable asymmetry along the $x$ axis and a single sinusoidal
potential along the perpendicular directions. Localized functions at the two
potential minima within each unit cell are similarly constructed, but using a
superposition of single-particle solutions from the two lowest bands. We
finally use these localized basis functions to determine the two-body
interaction energies in the Bose-Hubbard (BH) model, and show the dependence of
these energies on lattice asymmetry.

properties of magnetism at this interface are not well understood so far. In
this paper, we focus on transport effects driven by spin-orbit coupling and
intentionally neglect possible strong correlations. The electrical resistivity
tensor is calculated as a function of the magnitude and orientation of an
external magnetic field parallel to the interface. The semiclassical Boltzmann
equation is solved numerically for the two-dimensional system of spin-orbit
coupled electrons accelerated by an electric field and scattered by
spatially-correlated impurities. At temperatures of a few Kelvin and densities
such that the chemical potential crosses the second pair of spin-orbit split
bands, we find a strongly anisotropic modulation of the (negative)
magnetoresistance above 10 T, characterized by multiple maxima and minima away
from the crystalline axes. Along with the drop of the magnetoresistance, an
abrupt enhancement of the transverse resistivity occurs. The angular modulation
of the latter considerably deviates from a (low-field) sinusoidal dependence to
a (high-field) step-like behaviour. These peculiar features are the
consequences of the anisotropy of both (intra-band and inter-band )
scattering-amplitudes in the Brillouin zone when the relevant energy scales in
the system - chemical potential, spin-orbit interaction and Zeeman energy - are
all comparable to each other. The theory provides good qualitative agreement

distribution on observed variables is compatible with some causal structure.
The difficult case is when the causal structure includes latent variables. We
here introduce the $\textit{inflation technique}$ for tackling this problem. An
inflation of a causal structure is a new causal structure that can contain
multiple copies of each of the original variables, but where the ancestry of
each copy mirrors that of the original. To every distribution of the observed
variables that is compatible with the original causal structure, we assign a
family of marginal distributions on certain subsets of the copies that are
compatible with the inflated causal structure. It follows that compatibility
constraints for the inflation can be translated into compatibility constraints
for the original causal structure. Even if the constraints at the level of
inflation are weak, such as observable statistical independences implied by
disjoint causal ancestry, the translated constraints can be strong. We apply
this method to derive new inequalities whose violation by a distribution
witnesses that distribution's incompatibility with the causal structure (of
which Bell inequalities and Pearl's instrumental inequality are prominent
examples). We describe an algorithm for deriving all such inequalities for the
original causal structure that follow from ancestral independences in the
inflation. For three observed binary variables with pairwise common causes, it
yields inequalities that are stronger in at least some aspects than those
obtainable by existing methods. We also describe an algorithm that derives a
weaker set of inequalities but is more efficient. Finally, we discuss which
inflations are such that the inequalities one obtains from them remain valid
even for quantum (and post-quantum) generalizations of the notion of a causal
model.

the helical kink instability of a coronal flux rope which remains stable
against the torus instability. This model is tested against the well observed
filament eruption on 2002 May 27 in a parametric MHD simulation study which
comprises all phases of the event. Good agreement with the essential observed
properties is obtained. These include the confinement, terminal height,
writhing, distortion, and dissolution of the filament, and the flare loops. The
agreement is robust against variations in a representative range of parameter
space. Careful comparisons with the observation data constrain the ratio of the
external toroidal and poloidal field components to
$B_\mathrm{et}/B_\mathrm{ep}\approx1$ and the initial flux rope twist to
$\Phi\approx4\pi$. Different from ejective eruptions, two distinct phases of
strong magnetic reconnection can occur. First, the erupting flux is cut by
reconnection with overlying flux in the helical current sheet formed by the
instability. If the resulting flux bundles are linked as a consequence of the
erupting rope's strong writhing, they subsequently reconnect in the vertical

alphabet $V$ such that letters $x$ and $y$ alternate in $w$ if and only if $xy$
is an edge in $E$. It is known that any word-representable graph $G$ is
$k$-word-representable for some $k$, that is, there exists a word $w$
representing $G$ such that each letter occurs exactly $k$ times in $w$. The
minimum such $k$ is called $G$'s representation number.
  A crown graph $H_{n,n}$ is a graph obtained from the complete bipartite graph
$K_{n,n}$ by removing a perfect matching. In this paper we show that for $n\geq
5$, $H_{n,n}$'s representation number is $\lceil n/2 \rceil$. This result not
only provides a complete solution to the open Problem 7.4.2 in \cite{KL}, but
also gives a negative answer to the question raised in Problem 7.2.7 in
\cite{KL} on 3-word-representability of bipartite graphs. As a byproduct we
obtain a new example of a graph class with a high representation number.

The resulting photon beam passes through a 15 cm liquid hydrogen target,
producing $J/{\psi}$ mesons through a diffractive process in the $t$-channel,
or through a resonant process in the $s$- and $u$-channel. The decay $e^+e^-$
pair of the $J/{\psi}$ will be detected in coincidence using the two
high-momentum spectrometers of Hall C. The spectrometer settings have been
optimized to distinguish the resonant $s$- and $u$-channel production from the
diffractive $t$-channel $J/{\psi}$ production. The $s$- and $u$-channel
production of the charmed 5-quark resonance dominates the $t$-distribution at
large $t$. The momentum and angular resolution of the spectrometers is
sufficient to observe a clear resonance enhancement in the total cross section

reduces to estimating the optimal regularization parameter ($\tau$) of the

the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of
low quality and not very useful for de novo structure prediction. This paper
presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both
evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an
ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual networks. This deep
neural network allows us to model very complex sequence-contact relationship as
well as long-range inter-contact correlation. Our method greatly outperforms
existing contact prediction methods and leads to much more accurate
contact-assisted protein folding. Tested on three datasets of 579 proteins, the
average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained our method, the
representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21
and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method,
CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively. Ab initio folding
using our predicted contacts as restraints can yield correct folds (i.e.,
TMscore>0.6) for 203 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and
CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 proteins, respectively.
Further, our contact-assisted models have much better quality than
template-based models. Using our predicted contacts as restraints, we can (ab
initio) fold 208 of the 398 membrane proteins with TMscore>0.5. By contrast,
when the training proteins of our method are used as templates, homology
modeling can only do so for 10 of them. One interesting finding is that even if
we do not train our prediction models with any membrane proteins, our method
works very well on membrane protein prediction. Finally, in recent blind CAMEO
benchmark our method successfully folded 5 test proteins with a novel fold.

with initial conditions in the fractal basin boundaries, while the lowest

most important of these processes due to their practical relevance. However,
despite the similarities between them, current models address both spreading

model that is based on discrete time Markov chains. The model includes all the
transitions that are plausible for both a disease contagion process and rumor
propagation. We show that our model not only covers the traditional spreading
schemes, but that it also contains some features relevant in social dynamics,
such as apathy, forgetting, and lost/recovering of interest. The model is
evaluated analytically to obtain the spreading thresholds and the early time
dynamical behavior for the contact and reactive processes in several scenarios.
Comparison with Monte Carlo simulations shows that the Markov chain formalism
is highly accurate while it excels in computational efficiency. We round off
our work by showing how the proposed framework can be applied to the study of
spreading processes occurring on social networks.

entire information about the temporal ordering of observations which is
typically lost in the limit after time scaling. By going beyond the existing
asymptotic theory, we are able to prove a new functional limit theorem. Its
assumptions are satisfied by a wide class of applied time series models, for
which standard limiting theory in the space $D$ of \cadlag\ functions does not
apply.
  To describe the limit of partial sums in this more general setting, we use
the space~$E$ of so--called decorated \cadlag\ functions. We also study the
running maximum of partial sums for which a corresponding functional theorem
can be still expressed in the familiar setting of space $D$.
  We further apply our method to analyze record times in a sequence of

exists a puzzling gap between the results in theory and the observations in
numerical experience, i.e., algorithms with good polynomial bound are not
computationally efficient and algorithms demonstrated efficiency in computation
do not have a good or any polynomial bound. Todd raised a question in 2002:
""Can we find a theoretically and practically efficient way to reoptimize?"" This
paper is an effort to close the gap. We propose two arc-search infeasible
interior-point algorithms with infeasible central path neighborhood wider than
all existing infeasible interior-point algorithms that are proved to be
convergent. We show that the first algorithm is polynomial and its simplified
version, if it terminates in finite iterations, has a complexity bound equal to
the best known complexity bound for all (feasible or infeasible) interior-point
algorithms. We demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed
algorithms by testing all Netlib linear programming problems in standard form
and comparing the numerical results to those obtained by Mehrotra's
predictor-corrector algorithm and a recently developed more efficient
arc-search algorithm (the convergence of these two algorithms is unknown). We
conclude that the newly proposed algorithms are not only polynomial but also
computationally competitive comparing to both Mehrotra's predictor-corrector
algorithm and the efficient arc-search algorithm.

largely ignored due to a lack of methods that can assess the changing nature of
the relationship through time. This article introduces a method for the
simultaneous and automatic analysis of the association between the time-varying
power spectrum and covariates. The procedure adaptively partitions the grid of
time and covariate values into an unknown number of approximately stationary
blocks and nonparametrically estimates local spectra within blocks through
penalized splines. The approach is formulated in a fully Bayesian framework, in
which the number and locations of partition points are random, and fit using
reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Estimation and inference
averaged over the distribution of partitions allows for the accurate analysis
of spectra with both smooth and abrupt changes. The proposed methodology is
used to analyze the association between the time-varying spectrum of heart rate

equation is obtained and solved based on an alternative action proposed in
Ref.[1], under two different factor ordering choices. This action is
dynamically equivalent to the original EiBI action while it is free of square
root of the spacetime curvature. We consider a homogeneous, isotropic and
spatially flat universe, which is assumed to be dominated by a phantom perfect
fluid whose equation of state is a constant. We obtain exact solutions of the
WDW equation based on some specific conditions. In more general cases, we
propose a qualitative argument with the help of a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin
(WKB) approximation to get further solutions. Besides, we also construct an
effective WDW equation by simply promoting the classical Friedmann equations.
We find that for all the approaches considered, the DeWitt condition hinting
singularity avoidance is satisfied. Therefore the big rip singularity can be
avoided through the quantum approach within the EiBI theory.

magnetic properties (dynamo lifetime and magnetic dipole moment) of Proxima b
analogues (solid planets with masses of $\sim 1-3\,M_\oplus$, rotation periods

tidal heating and earth-like radiogenic mantle elements abundances. We devise a
statistical methodology to estimate the posterior distribution of the desired
planetary properties assuming simple prior distributions for the orbital
inclination and bulk composition. Our model predicts that Proxima b would have
a mass $1.3\leq M_{\rm p}\leq 2.3\,M_{\oplus}$ and a radius $R_{\rm

clustering of the Large Scale Structures (LSS) of the universe through LSS or

behavior with exquisite precision. The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale
Structures (EFTofLSS) provides a consistent framework to make predictions for
LSS observables in the mildly non-linear regime. In this paper we focus on
biased tracers. We argue that in calculations at a given order in the dark
matter perturbations, highly biased tracers will underperform because of their
larger higher derivative biases. A natural prediction of the EFTofLSS is
therefore that by simply adding higher derivative biases, all tracers should
perform comparably well. We implement this prediction for the halo-halo and the
halo-matter power spectra at one loop, and the halo-halo-halo,
halo-halo-matter, and halo-matter-matter bispectra at tree-level, and compare
with simulations. We find good agreement with the prediction: for all tracers,
we are able to match the bispectra up to $k\simeq0.17\,h/$Mpc at $z=0$ and the
power spectra to a higher wavenumber.

and the flat-space galileon. The first is realized in nature, the second is
more speculative, but they both exhibit apparent superluminality around
non-trivial backgrounds. In the QED case, we attempt, and fail, to find
backgrounds for which the superluminal signal advance can be made larger than
the putative resolving power of the EFT. In contrast, in the galileon case it
is easy to find such backgrounds, indicating that if the UV completion of the
galileon is (sub)luminal, quantum corrections must become important at distance
scales of order the Vainshtein radius of the background configuration, much
larger than the naive EFT strong coupling distance scale. Such corrections
would be reminiscent of the non-perturbative Schwarzschild scale quantum

about the connectivity in complicated magnetic field configurations. However,
calculating QSL maps even for 2-dimensional slices through 3-dimensional models
of coronal magnetic fields is a non-trivial task as it usually involves tracing
out millions of magnetic field lines with immense precision. Thus, extending
QSL calculations to three dimensions has rarely been done until now. In order
to address this challenge, we present QSL Squasher -- a public, open-source
code, which is optimized for calculating QSL maps in both two and three
dimensions on GPUs. The code achieves large processing speeds for three
reasons, each of which results in an order-of-magnitude speed-up. 1) The code
is parallelized using OpenCL. 2) The precision requirements for the QSL
calculation are drastically reduced by using perturbation theory. 3) A new
boundary detection criterion between quasi-connectivity domains is used, which
quickly identifies possible QSL locations which need to be finely sampled by
the code. That boundary detection criterion relies on finding the locations of
abrupt field-line length changes, which we do by introducing a new Field-line
Length Edge (FLEDGE) map. We find FLEDGE maps useful on their own as a
quick-and-dirty substitute for QSL maps. QSL Squasher allows constructing
high-resolution 3D FLEDGE maps in a matter of minutes, which is two orders of
magnitude faster than calculating the corresponding 3D QSL maps. We include a
sample of calculations done using QSL Squasher to demonstrate its capabilities
as a QSL calculator, as well as to compare QSL and FLEDGE maps.

simulations in full general relativity, we find that the one-arm instability is
generic in that it can develop in HMNSs within a few tens of milliseconds after
merger for all equations of state in our survey. We find that mergers with
stiffer equations of state tend to produce HMNSs with stronger $m=2$ azimuthal
mode density deformations, and weaker $m=1$ components, relative to softer
equations of state. We also find that for equations of state that can give rise
to double-core HMNSs, large $m=1$ density modes can already be present due to
asymmetries in the two cores. This results in the generation of $l=2$, $m=1$
gravitational wave modes even before the dominance of a one-arm mode that
ultimately arises following merger of the two cores. Our results further
suggest that stiffer equations of state give rise to HMNSs generating lower
$m=1$ gravitational wave frequencies. Thus, if gravitational waves from the
one-arm instability are detected, they could in principle constrain the neutron
star equation of state. We estimate that, depending on the equation of state,
the one-arm mode could potentially be detectable by second generation
gravitational wave detectors at $\sim 10$ Mpc and by third generation ones at
$\sim 100$ Mpc. Finally, we provide estimates of the properties of dynamical

high-resolution NIR spectra to measure its projected rotational broadening and

and our derived stellar radii, we show that all planetary orbits are consistent
with alignment to their host star's rotation. We fit the K2 light curves,

eccentricities, all of which are consistent with zero. The difference between
the number of planets found in Praesepe and Hyades (8 planets) and a similar

lose atmosphere past 800 Myr, as now two planets at this age have radii
significantly larger than their older counterparts from Kepler.

Population III-like stellar population, or alternatively, be a candidate Direct
Collapse Black Hole (DCBH). In this paper we investigate the evidence for these
exotic scenarios using recently available, deeper, optical, near-infrared and
mid-infrared imaging. We find strong Spitzer/IRAC detections for the main
component of CR7 at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, and show that it has a blue colour
([3.6] - [4.5] $= -1.2\pm 0.3$). This colour cannot be reproduced by current
Pop. III or pristine DCBH models. Instead, the results suggest that the [3.6]
band is contaminated by the [OIII]4959,5007 emission line with an implied
rest-frame equivalent width of EW_0 (H$\beta$ + [OIII]) $\gtrsim 2000$\AA.
Furthermore, we find that new near-infrared data from the UltraVISTA survey
supports a weaker He II 1640 emission line than previously measured, with EW_0
$= 40 \pm 30$\AA. For the fainter components of CR7 visible in Hubble Space
Telescope imaging, we find no evidence that they are particularly red as
previously claimed, and show that the derived masses and ages are considerably
uncertain. In light of the likely detection of strong [OIII] emission in CR7 we
discuss other more standard interpretations of the system that are consistent
with the data. We find that a low-mass, narrow-line AGN can reproduce the
observed features of CR7, including the lack of radio and X-ray detections.
Alternatively, a young, low-metallicity (~1/200 solar) starburst, modelled
including binary stellar pathways, can reproduce the inferred strength of the
He II line and simultaneously the strength of the observed [OIII] emission, but
only if the gas shows super-solar $\alpha$-element abundances (O/Fe ~ 5 O/Fe
solar).

are many astrophysical questions for which the parallax zero-point error
$\sigma(\pi_0)$ will be the fundamentally limiting constraint. These include
the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Galactic Center. We show
that by using the photometric parallax estimates for RR Lyrae stars (RRL)
within 8kpc, via the ultra-precise infrared period-luminosity relation, one can
independently determine a hyper-precise value for $\pi_{0}$. Despite their
paucity relative to bright quasars, we show that RRL are competitive due to
their order-of-magnitude improved parallax precision for each individual object
relative to bright quasars. We show that this method is mathematically robust
and well-approximated by analytic formulae over a wide range of relevant

realisations to modify the linear density field within and around the
Lagrangian patches that form dark-matter haloes. The ambitious concept is to
forge `genetically modified' haloes with some desired properties after the
non-linear evolution. We demonstrate that the original implementation of this
method is not exact but approximate because it tacitly assumes that protohaloes
sample a set of random points with a fixed mean overdensity. We show that
carrying out a full genetic modification is a formidable and daunting task
requiring a mathematical understanding of what determines the biased locations
of protohaloes in the linear density field. We discuss approximate solutions
based on educated guesses regarding the nature of protohaloes. We illustrate
how the excursion-set method can be adapted to predict the non-linear evolution
of the modified patches and thus fine tune the constraints that are necessary
to obtain preselected halo properties. This technique allows us to explore the
freedom around the original algorithm for genetic modification. We find that
the quantity which is most sensitive to changes is the halo mass-accretion rate
at the mass scale on which the constraints are set. Finally we discuss

Our algorithm also finds a low energy state that achieves this approximation.
The low energy state is represented as a superposition of $\exp{[O(b^3)]}$

attention in recent years, especially in the context of high-dimensional
testing. A number of approaches have been proposed, all limited to the
two-sample problem and involving varying statistics and assumptions on the
number of features $p$ vs. the sample size $n$. There are no general approaches
to test association of covariances with a continuous outcome. We propose a
uniform framework for testing association of covariances with an experimental
variable, whether discrete or continuous. The approach is not limited by the
data dimensions. Our test procedure (i) does not rely on parametric
assumptions, (ii) works well for a range of $p$ and $n$ (e.g., does not require
$n > p$), (iii) provides correct type I error control, and (iv) includes four
different statistics, to ensure power and flexibility under various settings,
including a new ""connectivity"" statistic that is sensitive to changes in
overall covariance magnitude. We demonstrate that, for the two-sample special
case, the proposed statistics are permutationally equivalent or similar to
existing proposed statistics. We demonstrate the power and utility of our
approaches via simulation and analysis of real data. The approach is
implemented in an $R$ package.

more cost-effective when they work to establish a supply chain in space, mining
and manufacturing then replicating the assets of the supply chain so it grows
to larger capacity. This has become achievable because of advances in robotics
and artificial intelligence. It is roughly estimated that developing a lunar
outpost that relies upon and also develops the supply chain will cost about 1/3
or less of the existing annual budgets of the national space programs. It will
require a sustained commitment of several decades to complete, during which
time science and exploration become increasingly effective. At the end, this
space industry will capable of addressing global-scale challenges including
limited resources, clean energy, economic development, and preservation of the
environment. Other potential solutions, including nuclear fusion and
terrestrial renewable energy sources, do not address the root problem of our
limited globe and there are real questions whether they will be inadequate or
too late. While industry in space likewise cannot provide perfect assurance, it
is uniquely able to solve the root problem, and it gives us an important chance
that we should grasp. What makes this such an historic opportunity is that the
space-based solution is obtainable as a side-benefit of doing space science and
exploration within their existing budgets. Thinking pragmatically, it may take
some time for policymakers to agree that setting up a complete supply chain is
an achievable goal, so this paper describes a strategy of incremental progress.

semistability and canonical filtration, in the setting of combinatorial

associated to a Galois connection between two lattices. It applies, in
particular, to matroids.
  We then specialize this to linear codes. This could be done from at least
three different approaches: using the sphere-packing analogy, or the geometric
view, or the Galois connection construction just introduced. A remarkable fact
is that these all lead to the same notion of semistability and canonical
filtration. Relations to previous propositions towards a classification of
codes, and to Wei's generalized Hamming weight hierarchy, are also discussed.
  Last, we study the important question of the preservation of semistability
(or more generally the behaviour of slopes) under duality, and under tensor
product. The former essentially follows from Wei's duality theorem for higher
weights---and its matroid version---which we revisit in an appendix, developing
analogues of the Riemann-Roch, Serre duality, Clifford, and gap and gonality
sequence theorems for codes. Likewise the latter is closely related to the
bound on higher weights of a tensor product, conjectured by Wei and Yang, and
proved by Schaathun in the geometric language, which we reformulate directly in
terms of codes. From this material we then derive semistability of tensor
product.

specifies the desired dose-per-voxel, and therefore replaces any requirement

planning. A probabilistic dose distribution is inferred from the most relevant

most likely spatial distribution of dose to yield a specific dose prior

converts the predicted dose distribution to a deliverable treatment plan dose

positive edges correspond to pairs of ""friends"", and negative edges to pairs of

query each pair of nodes whether they belong to the same cluster or not, but
the answer to the query is corrupted with some probability $0<q<\frac{1}{2}$.

simple breadth first search as its main algorithmic primitive. Finally, we

stimulation by a BBCI shape population-level synaptic connectivity? The present
work describes a recurrent neural network model with probabilistic spiking
mechanisms and plastic synapses capable of capturing both neural and synaptic
activity statistics relevant to BBCI conditioning protocols. When spikes from a
neuron recorded at one MC site trigger stimuli at a second target site after a
fixed delay, the connections between sites are strengthened for spike-stimulus
delays consistent with experimentally derived spike time dependent plasticity
(STDP) rules. However, the relationship between STDP mechanisms at the level of
networks, and their modification with neural implants remains poorly
understood. Using our model, we successfully reproduces key experimental
results and use analytical derivations, along with novel experimental data. We
then derive optimal operational regimes for BBCIs, and formulate predictions
concerning the efficacy of spike-triggered stimulation in different regimes of

""large"" independent set in an auxiliary graph $H(G,L)$ with vertex set
$\{(v,c)\,: \, v\in V(G) \text{ and } {c\in L(v)} \}$. It is similar to the old
reduction by Plesnevi\v{c} and Vizing of the $k$-coloring problem to the
problem of finding an independent set of size $|V(G)|$ in the Cartesian product
$G\square K_k$. Some properties of the DP-chromatic number $\chi_{DP}(G)$

predictions made using a hierarchical model of cosmic chemical evolution based
on two recently proposed SFRs, one based on the observed galaxy luminosity
function at high redshift and one based on the GRB rate and find that within
the considerable scatter in metal abundance measures, they both are consistent
with the data. Analyzing the ensemble of different measurements together, we
conclude that despite metallicity biases, GRBs may be a less biased probe of
star-formation at z>3 than at z<2. There is likely to be a common origin to the
high GRB rate per unit star-formation and the high observed Lyman-continuum
production rate in high redshift galaxies and that this may be due to a
relative overabundance of stars with mass $>$25Msun which are likely GRB
progenitors. We also find that to reconcile these measurements with the Thomson
scattering cross section of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons measured
by Planck, the escape fraction of Lyman-continuum photons from galaxies must be
low, about 15 percent or less and that the clumping factor of the IGM is likely
to be small, about 3. Finally, we demonstrate that GRBs are unique probes of
metallicity evolution in low-mass galaxy samples and that GRB hosts likely lost
a significant fraction of metals to the intergalactic medium (IGM) due to

performance does not degenerate even for a network size on the order of $10^4$,
and is thus readily applicable to large-scale complex networks. Such a
breakthrough is achieved by considering both prior biological knowledge and

hyper-luminous X-ray source, ESO 243-49 HLX-1. We found a strong observational
evidence that ESO 243-49 HLX-1 underwent spectral transitions from the low/hard
state to the high/soft state during these observations. The spectra of ESO
243-49 HLX-1 are well fitted by the so-{called} bulk motion Comptonization
model for all spectral states. We have established the photon index Gamma
saturation level, Gamma_{sat}$=3.0+/-0.1, in the correlation of Gamma versus
mass accretion rate dot M. This Gamma-dot M correlation allows us to estimate
the black hole (BH) mass in ESO 243-49 HLX-1 to be M_{BH}~ 7x 10^4 solar
masses, assuming the distance to ESO 243-49 of 95 Mpc. For the BH mass estimate
we used the scaling method, taking Galactic BHs XTE~J1550-564, H~1743-322 and
4U~1630-472, and an extragalactic BH source, M101 ULX-1 as reference sources.
The Gamma-dot M correlation revealed in ESO 243-49 HLX-1 is similar to those in
a number of Galactic and extragalactic BHs and it clearly shows the correlation
along with the strong Gamma saturation at ~ 3. This is a reliable observational
evidence of a BH in ESO 243-49 HLX-1. We also found that the seed (disk) photon
temperatures are quite low, of order of 50-140 eV which are consistent with a
high BH mass in ESO 243-49 HLX-1.

interactions under the exact dispersion relation associated with gravity waves
in fluid of intermediate depth. A Korteweg-de Vries type of equation with exact
dispersion property is adopted as the governing equation for unidirectional
wave packet evolution. Following the idea from Zakharov's seminal paper
(Zakharov, V. E. (1968) Stability of periodic waves of finite amplitude on the
surface of a deep fluid. \textit{Journal of Applied Mechanics and Technical
Physics}, {\bf 9}, 190--194), the equation is transformed from the
spatial--temporal domain to the wavenumber--temporal domain. The solution of
the transformed equation is sought using the perturbation theory, for which the
ansatz is expressed in the form of a regular expansion in the increasing order
of a small parameter. After implementing the na\""{i}ve perturbation method, due
to nonlinear mode generation and particular combinations of wavenumbers, the
third-order solution contains spurious secular growth terms which appear as a
consequence of resonant interaction and nonlinear mode generation. These
spurious secular growth terms can be prevented by implementing the method of
strained parameters for which nonlinear dispersion relation terms are produced
for particular combination of wavenumbers.

fluids have the same density but different viscosities. The fluids, when
miscible, are separated from each other by a mixed layer of small but finite
thickness, across which viscosity changes from that of one fluid to that of the
other. When immiscible, the interface is sharp. Our study spans a range of
Schmidt numbers, viscosity ratios and location and thickness of the mixed
layer. A region of instability distinct from that of the Tollmien-Schlichting
mode is obtained at moderate Reynolds numbers. We show that the overlap of the
layer of viscosity-stratification with the critical layer of the dominant
disturbance provides a mechanism for this instability. At very low values of
diffusivity, the miscible flow behaves exactly like the immiscible in terms of
stability characteristics. High levels of miscibility make the flow more
stable. At intermediate levels of diffusivity however, in both linear and
non-linear regimes, miscible flow can be more unstable than the corresponding
immiscible flow without surface tension.

account for a large proportion of the global disease burden, and their control
faces several challenges including diminishing human and financial resources
for those distressed from such diseases. Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), the
second-largest parasitic killer in the world (after malaria) affects poor
populations in endemic countries and causes considerable cost to the affected
individuals and their society. Mathematical models can serve as a critical tool
for understanding the driving mechanisms of a NTD such as VL. The WHO promotes
integrated control programs for VL but this policy is not well supported by
systematic quantitative and dynamic evidence and so potential benefits of the
policy are limited. Moreover, mathematical models can be readily developed and
used to understand the functioning of the VL system cheaply and systematically.
The focus of this research is three-fold: (i) to identify non-traditional but
critical mechanisms for ongoing VL transmission in resource limited regions,
(ii) to review mathematical models used for other infectious diseases that have
the potential to capture identified factors of VL, and (iii) to suggest novel
quantitative models for understanding VL dynamics and for evaluating control
programs in such frameworks for achieveing VL elimination goals.

This question is of key importance to numerous important applications that rely

graph vulnerability. Despite the large amount of work on designing scalable
approximation algorithms for betweenness centrality, estimating it on
large-scale networks remains a computational challenge.
  In this paper, we study the Betweenness Centrality Maximization problem:
given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a positive integer $k$, find a set $S^* \subseteq
V$ that maximizes betweenness centrality subject to the cardinality constraint
$|S^*| \leq k$. We present an efficient randomized algorithm that provides a
$(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation with high probability, where $\epsilon>0$. Our
results improve the current state-of-the-art result by
Yoshida~\cite{yoshida2014almost}. Furthermore, we provide theoretical evidence
for the validity of a crucial assumption in the literature of betweenness
centrality estimation, namely that in real-world networks $O(|V|^2)$ shortest
paths pass through the top-$k$ central nodes, where $k$ is a constant. On the
experimental side, we perform an extensive experimental analysis of our method
on real-world networks, demonstrate its accuracy and scalability, and study

We estimated the maximum ratio of solar radiation pressure with respect to the
solar gravity beta_max = 1.6 +/- 0.2, which is consistent with porous dust

equivalent to the upper convected Maxwell fluid in the limit that
Np$\rightarrow \infty$. Depending on the Reynolds number Re, we studied the
dynamical behaviors of fibers for the (a) Re =0 and (b) finite Re cases, for
different draw ratios Dr, ranging from 10 to 30, and two typical Deborah
numbers De=$10^{-3}$ and De=$10^{-2}$. In the limit Re$\rightarrow$ 0 (a), as
the Deborah number De increases, the elastic effect makes the system stable. At
finite Re (b), we found that inertial effects play an important role in
determining the dynamical behavior of the spinning process, and for
Dr=$10^{-2}$ the system is quite stable, at least up to a draw ratio of Dr=30.
We also found that the fiber velocity and cross section area are determined
solely by the draw ratio. By comparing the velocity and cross section area
profiles with the end-point distribution for the dumbbell connective vectors,
for dumbbells located in Lagrangian particles along typical places along the

(PPDs). Freeze-out and sublimation processes determine their division between
gas and solid phases, which affects both which disk regions can be traced by
which volatiles, and the formation and composition of planets. Recently,
multiple lines of evidence suggest that CO is substantially depleted from the
gas in the outer regions of PPDs. In this letter, we show that the gas dynamics
in the outer PPDs facilitates volatile depletion through a mechanism which we
term ""runaway freeze-out"". Using a simple 1D model that incorporates dust
settling, turbulent diffusion of dust and volatiles, as well as volatile
freeze-out/sublimation processes, we show that as long as turbulence in the
cold midplane is sufficiently weak to allow majority of the small grains to
settle, CO in the warm surface layer can be turbulently mixed into the midplane
region and depleted by freeze-out. The level of depletion sensitively depends
on the level of disk turbulence. Based on recent disk simulations that suggest
a layered turbulence profile with very weak midplane turbulence and strong

oscillation based on Lorentz invariance violation in non-commutative field
theory is discussed. It is found that the previous studies about massless
neutrino oscillation within deformed canonical anti-commutation relations
should satisfy the condition of new Moyal product and new non standard
commutation relations. Furthermore, comparing the Lorentz Invariant Violation
parameters $\mathit{A}$ in the previous studies with new Moyal product and new
non standard commutation relations, we find that the orders of magnitude of
non-commutative parameters (Lorentz invariant Violation parameters
$\mathit{A}$) is not self-consistent. This inconsistency means that the
previous studies of Lorentz invariance violation in non-commutative field
theory may not naturally explain massless neutrino oscillation. In other words,
it should be impossible to explain neutrino oscillation by Lorentz invariance
violation in non-commutative field theory. This conclusion is supported by the
latest atmospheric neutrinos experimental results from the Super-Kamiokande
Collaboration, which show that no evidence of Lorentz invariance violation on
atmospheric neutrinos was observed.

that the variation of the on-shell action with respect to the conical angle is
equal to the length of the corresponding conical defect. We derive this

Moreover, the deflection angle of the light ray near the weakly naked

deflection angle near the singularity tends to a certain finite value, whose
sign depends on the rotation parameter and the deformation parameter. These

malicious data and increase their chances of evading detection at test time;
e.g., malware code is typically obfuscated using random strings or byte
sequences to hide known exploits. Interestingly, randomization has also been
proposed to improve security of learning algorithms against evasion attacks, as
it results in hiding information about the classifier to the attacker. Recent
work has proposed game-theoretical formulations to learn secure classifiers, by
simulating different evasion attacks and modifying the classification function
accordingly. However, both the classification function and the simulated data
manipulations have been modeled in a deterministic manner, without accounting
for any form of randomization. In this work, we overcome this limitation by
proposing a randomized prediction game, namely, a non-cooperative
game-theoretic formulation in which the classifier and the attacker make
randomized strategy selections according to some probability distribution
defined over the respective strategy set. We show that our approach allows one
to improve the trade-off between attack detection and false alarms with respect
to state-of-the-art secure classifiers, even against attacks that are different

  Distance based Histogram Comparison",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dictionary plays an important role in multi-instance data representation. It
maps bags of instances to histograms. Earth mover's distance (EMD) is the most
effective histogram distance metric for the application of multi-instance
retrieval. However, up to now, there is no existing multi-instance dictionary
learning methods designed for EMD based histogram comparison. To fill this gap,
we develop the first EMD-optimal dictionary learning method using stochastic
optimization method. In the stochastic learning framework, we have one triplet
of bags, including one basic bag, one positive bag, and one negative bag. These
bags are mapped to histograms using a multi-instance dictionary. We argue that
the EMD between the basic histogram and the positive histogram should be
smaller than that between the basic histogram and the negative histogram. Base
on this condition, we design a hinge loss. By minimizing this hinge loss and
some regularization terms of the dictionary, we update the dictionary
instances. The experiments over multi-instance retrieval applications shows its
effectiveness when compared to other dictionary learning methods over the
problems of medical image retrieval and natural language relation
classification.

cross-correlation and cross-identification based on explicit simplified
catalogue models. A proper identification process should rely on both
astrometric and photometric data. Under some conditions, the astrometric part
and the photometric part can be processed separately and merged a posteriori to
provide a single global probability of identification. The present paper
addresses almost exclusively the astrometrical part and specifies the proper
probabilities to be merged with photometric likelihoods.
  To select matching candidates in n catalogues, we used the Chi (or,
indifferently, the Chi-square) test with 2(n-1) degrees of freedom. We thus
call this cross-match a chi-match. In order to use Bayes' formula, we
considered exhaustive sets of hypotheses based on combinatorial analysis. The
volume of the Chi-test domain of acceptance -- a 2(n-1)-dimensional acceptance
ellipsoid -- is used to estimate the expected numbers of spurious associations.
We derived priors for those numbers using a frequentist approach relying on
simple geometrical considerations. Likelihoods are based on standard Rayleigh,
Chi and Poisson distributions that we normalized over the Chi-test acceptance
domain. We validated our theoretical results by generating and cross-matching
synthetic catalogues.
  The results we obtain do not depend on the order used to cross-correlate the
catalogues. We applied the formalism described in the present paper to build
the multi-wavelength catalogues used for the science cases of the ARCHES
(Astronomical Resource Cross-matching for High Energy Studies) project. Our
cross-matching engine is publicly available through a multi-purpose web
interface. In a longer term, we plan to integrate this tool into the CDS XMatch
Service.

alpha-stable distributions. Dealing with impulsive noise environments comes
with an added complexity with respect to the standard Gaussian environment: the
alpha-stable probability density functions have an infinite second moment and
the ""nice"" Hilbert space structure of the space of random variables having a
finite second moment is lost along with its tools and methodologies. This is
indeed the case in estimation theory where classical tools to quantify
performance of an estimator are tightly related to the assumption of finite
variance variables. In alpha-stable environments, expressions such as the mean
square error and the Cramer-Rao bound are hence problematic. In this work, we
tackle the parameter estimation problem in impulsive noise environments and
develop novel tools that are tailored to the alpha-stable and heavy-tailed
noise environments, tools that coincide with the standard ones adopted in the
Gaussian setup, namely a generalized ""power"" measure and a generalized Fisher

Fisher information inequality, the isoperimetric inequality for entropies and
the Cramer-Rao bound. Additionally, we derive upper bounds on the differential
entropy of independent sums having a stable component. Finally, the new ""power""

functional PCA. This paradigm implicitly assumes that rough variation is due to
nuisance noise. Nevertheless, relevant functional features such as
time-localised or short scale fluctuations may indeed be rough relative to the
global scale, but still smooth at shorter scales. These may be confounded with
the global smooth components of variation by the smoothing and PCA, potentially
distorting the parsimony and interpretability of the analysis. The goal of this
paper is to investigate how both smooth and rough variations can be recovered
on the basis of discretely observed functional data. Assuming that a functional
datum arises as the sum of two uncorrelated components, one smooth and one
rough, we develop identifiability conditions for the recovery of the two
corresponding covariance operators. The key insight is that they should possess
complementary forms of parsimony: one smooth and finite rank (large scale), and
the other banded and potentially infinite rank (small scale). Our conditions
elucidate the precise interplay between rank, bandwidth, and grid resolution.
Under these conditions, we show that the recovery problem is equivalent to
rank-constrained matrix completion, and exploit this to construct estimators of
the two covariances, without assuming knowledge of the true bandwidth or rank;
we study their asymptotic behaviour, and then use them to recover the smooth
and rough components of each functional datum by best linear prediction. As a
result, we effectively produce separate functional PCAs for smooth and rough
variation.

Wright-Fisher type Markov chain with a frequency dependent fitness. In a strong
selection regime that favors one of the two groups, we obtain qualitatively
matching lower and upper bounds for the fixation probability of the
advantageous population. In the infinite population limit we obtain an exact
result showing that a single advantageous mutant can invade an infinite
population with a positive probability. We also give asymptotically sharp
bounds for the fixation time distribution.

dynamic evolution of the U(1)-invariant relativistic complex field theory in
three dimensions. This model has been used to describe, in various limits,
properties of relativistic bosons at finite chemical potential, type II su-
perconductors, magnetic materials and aspects of cosmology. We characterise the
thermodynamic second-order phase transition in different ways. We study the
equilibrium vortex configurations and their statistical and geometrical
properties in equilibrium at all temperatures. We show that at very high
temperature the statistics of the filaments is the one of fully-packed loop
models. We identify the temperature, within the ordered phase, at which the
number density of vortex lengths falls-off algebraically and we associate it to
a geometric percolation transition that we characterise in various ways. We
measure the fractal properties of the vortex tangle at this threshold. Next, we
perform infinite rate quenches from equilibrium in the disordered phase, across
the thermo- dynamic critical point, and deep into the ordered phase. We show
that three time regimes can be distinguished: a first approach towards a state
that, within numerical accuracy, shares many features with the one at the
percolation threshold, a later coarsening process that does not alter, at
sufficiently low temperature, the fractal properties of the long vortex loops,
and a final approach to equilibrium. These features are independent of the
reconnection rule used to build the vortex lines. In each of these regimes we
identify the various length-scales of the vortices in the system. We also study
the scaling properties of the ordering process and the progressive annihilation
of topological defects and we prove that the time-dependence of the
time-evolving vortex tangle can be described within the dynamic scaling
framework.

from first submicroscopic principles inherent in the very nature of real space
that is constituted as a tessellattice of primary topological balls. The
submicroscopic concept determines the notion of mass in the tessellattice and
introduces excitations of space, which appear at the motion of particles (mass
particles are determined as local deformations of the tessellattice). These
excitations are associated with carriers of the field of inertia. In the
universe the gravitation is induced by standing inerton waves of mass objects,
which oscillate around the objects with the speed of light. An overlapping of
these standing inerton waves generates an elastic interaction between masses
bringing them to a formation of clusters in which masses are characterised by
both the Newtonian and elastic interaction. It is this elastic interaction that
cancels the necessity of introduction of mystical dark matter. At the same
time, inertons, carriers of inert properties of objects, can be treated as an
analogous of hypothetic weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP) or axions,
which some astronomers try to associate with dark matter particles.
