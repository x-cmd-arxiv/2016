black holes. Two interesting models are considered. One is the self-regular
Schwarzschild-AdS black hole whose mass density is given by the analogue to
probability densities of quantum hydrogen atoms. The other model is the same
black hole but whose mass density is chosen to be a rational fractional
function of radial coordinates. Both mass densities are in fact analytic
expressions of the ${\delta}$-function. We analyze the phase structures of the
two models by investigating the heat capacity at constant pressure and the
Gibbs free energy in an isothermal-isobaric ensemble. Both models fail to decay
into the pure thermal radiation even with the positive Gibbs free energy due to
the existence of a minimal length. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to a
general mass-smeared form that is also associated with the ${\delta}$-function,
and indicate the similar thermodynamic properties for various possible
mass-smeared forms based on the ${\delta}$-function.

discriminant $d$, and let $\varepsilon_d$ be the corresponding fundamental
unit. In this paper, we obtain an asymptotic formula for the $k$-th moment of
$h(d)$ over positive discriminants $d$ with $\varepsilon_d\leq x$, uniformly
for real numbers $k$ in the range $0<k\leq (\log x)^{1-o(1)}$. This improves
upon the work of Raulf, who obtained such an asymptotic for a fixed positive
integer $k$. We also investigate the distribution of large values of $h(d)$
when the $d$'s are ordered according to the size of their fundamental units
$\varepsilon_d$. In particular, we show that the tail of this distribution has
the same shape as that of class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields ordered
by the size of their discriminants. As an application of these results, we
prove that there are many positive discriminants $d$ with class number
$h(d)\geq (e^{\gamma}/3+o(1))\cdot\varepsilon_d (\log\log \varepsilon_d)/\log
\varepsilon_d$, a bound that we believe is best possible. We also obtain an
upper bound for $h(d)$ that is twice as large, assuming the generalized Riemann
hypothesis.

holes could be treated as consisting of a Bose-Einstein condensate of

chemical potential-like term, thus placing ourselves in a grand-canonical
ensemble. The form and characteristics of this chemical potential-like piece
are discussed in some detail. We argue that the resulting equations of motion
derived from the action could be interpreted as the Gross-Pitaevskii equation
describing a graviton Bose-Einstein condensate trapped by the black hole
gravitational field. After this, we proceed to expand the ensuring equations of
motion up to second order around the classical Schwarzschild metric so that
some non-linear terms in the metric fluctuation are kept. Next we search for
solutions and, modulo some very plausible assumptions, we find out that the
condensate vanishes outside the horizon but is non-zero in its interior.
Inspired by a linearized approximation around the horizon we are able to find
an exact solution for the mean-field wave function describing the graviton
Bose-Einstein condensate in the black hole interior. After this, we can
rederive some of the relations involving the number of gravitons $N$ and the
black hole characteristics along the lines suggested by Dvali and G\'omez.

employ a recently developed pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group
(pf-FRG) approach to study the low-temperature quantum magnetism of kagome and
hyperkagome spin systems with exchange interactions beyond the nearest neighbor
coupling. We find that next-nearest neighbor couplings stabilize a variety of
magnetic orders as well as induce additional spin liquid regimes giving rise to
rather rich phase diagrams, which we characterize in detail. On a technical
level, we find that the pf-FRG approach is in excellent quantitative agreement
with high-temperature series expansions over their range of validity and it
exhibits a systematic finite-size convergence in the temperature regime below.
We discuss notable advantages and some current limitations of the pf-FRG
approach in the ongoing search for unconventional forms of quantum magnetism.

streams formed in a Milky-Way-like dark matter halo of the Aquarius suite of

reasonably well. To quantify this further, we determine the best-fit potential
parameters by maximizing the amount of clustering of the stream stars in the

recover a mass profile that is consistent with the spherically-averaged dark

Combining analytical and numerical continuation techniques, we show that the
physics of this active system is essentially controlled by the reversal
frequency. In particular, we find that elongated, high-density, ordered
patterns, called bands, emerge via subcritical bifurcations from spatially
homogeneous states. Our analysis reveals further that the interaction of bands
is weakly attractive and, consequently, bands fuse upon collision in analogy
with nonequilibrium nucleation processes. Moreover, we demonstrate that a
renormalized positive line tension can be assigned to stable bands below a
critical reversal rate, beyond which they are transversally unstable. In
addition, we discuss the kinetic roughening of bands as well as their nonlinear
dynamics close to the threshold of transversal instability. Altogether, the
reduction of the multi-particle system onto the dynamics of bands provides a
framework to understand the impact of the reversal frequency on the emerging
nonequilibrium patterns in self-propelled particle systems. In this regard, our
results constitute a proof-of-principle in favor of the hypothesis in
microbiology that reversal of gliding rod-shaped bacteria regulates the

tested whether activity in this network predicted performance on measures of

activation related to the extent of left hemispheric damage. Activation
magnitudes in the each hemispheric network were strongly correlated, but four
right frontal regions showed heightened activity in patients with large

recent years have created unprecedented opportunities for scientific research
driven by statistical analysis. Inherent limitations of statistics impose
constrains on reliability of conclusions drawn from data but misuse of
statistical methods is a growing concern. Significance, hypothesis testing and
the accompanying P-values are being scrutinized as representing most widely
applied and abused practices. One line of critique is that P-values are
inherently unfit to fulfill their ostensible role as measures of scientific
hypothesis's credibility. It has also been suggested that while P-values may
have their role as summary measures of effect, researchers underappreciate the
degree of randomness in the P-value. High variability of P-values would suggest
that having obtained a small P-value in one study, one is, nevertheless, likely
to obtain a much larger P-value in a similarly powered replication study. Thus,
""replicability of P-value"" is itself questionable. To characterize P-value
variability one can use prediction intervals whose endpoints reflect the likely
spread of P-values that could have been obtained by a replication study.
Unfortunately, the intervals currently in use, the P-intervals, are based on
unrealistic implicit assumptions. Namely, P-intervals are constructed with the
assumptions that imply substantial chances of encountering large values of
effect size in an observational study, which leads to bias. As an alternative
to P-intervals, we develop a method that gives researchers flexibility by
providing them with the means to control these assumptions. Unlike endpoints of
P-intervals, endpoints of our intervals are directly interpreted as
probabilistic bounds for replication P-values and are resistant to selection
bias contingent upon approximate prior knowledge of the effect size
distribution.

particles with spin $s$ acting in a Hilbert space has at best scaling dimension
$s+1$, which excludes its use in the perturbative construction of
renormalizable interacting models for higher spin ($s\geq 1$). Up to date, such
models have been constructed only in the context of gauge theory, at the cost
of introducing additional unphysical (ghost) fields and an unphysical
(indefinite metric) state space. The unphysical degrees of freedom are divided
out by requiring gauge (or BRST) invariance.
  We construct free quantum fields for higher spin particles which have the
same good UV behaviour as the scalar field (scaling dimension one), and at the
same time act on a Hilbert space without ghosts. They are localized on
semi-infinite strings extending to space-like infinity, but are linearly
related to their point-local counterparts. We argue that this is sufficient
locality for a perturbative construction of interacting models of the gauge
theory type, with a string-independent S-matrix and point-localized interacting
observable fields. The usual principle of gauge-invariance is here replaced by
the (deeper) principle of locality.

Then constraints from K and B decays require that loop contributions to flavour
changing vertices cancel at least at the 10% level. Constraints from beam dump
experiments require the coupling of A to electrons to be larger than about 4
times the coupling of the standard Higgs boson, leading to a short enough A

biased image by discounting the effects of scene illuminant and camera spectral
sensitivity (CSS) at the same time. Most color constancy (CC) models have been
designed to first estimate the illuminant color, which is then removed from the
color biased image to obtain an image taken under white light, without the
explicit consideration of CSS effect on CC. This paper first studies the CSS
effect on illuminant estimation arising in the inter-dataset-based CC
(inter-CC), i.e., training a CC model on one dataset and then testing on
another dataset captured by a distinct CSS. We show the clear degradation of
existing CC models for inter-CC application. Then a simple way is proposed to
overcome such degradation by first learning quickly a transform matrix between
the two distinct CSSs (CSS-1 and CSS-2). The learned matrix is then used to
convert the data (including the illuminant ground truth and the color biased
images) rendered under CSS-1 into CSS-2, and then train and apply the CC model
on the color biased images under CSS-2, without the need of burdensome
acquiring of training set under CSS-2. Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real images show that our method can clearly improve the inter-CC performance
for traditional CC algorithms. We suggest that by taking the CSS effect into
account, it is more likely to obtain the truly color constant images invariant
to the changes of both illuminant and camera sensors.

estimating the mean of a population of graphs based on a sample is a core
problem. Often, this problem is especially difficult because the sample or
cohort size is relatively small, sometimes even a single subject. While using
the element-wise sample mean of the adjacency matrices is a common approach,
this method does not exploit any underlying structural properties of the
graphs. We propose using a low-rank method which incorporates tools for
dimension selection and diagonal augmentation to smooth the estimates and
improve performance over the naive methodology for small sample sizes.
Theoretical results for the stochastic blockmodel show that this method offers
major improvements when there are many vertices. Similarly, we demonstrate that
the low-rank methods outperform the standard sample mean for a variety of
independent edge distributions as well as human connectome data derived from
magnetic resonance imaging, especially when sample sizes are small. Moreover,
the low-rank methods yield ""eigen-connectomes"", which correlate with the
lobe-structure of the human brain and superstructures of the mouse brain. These
results indicate that low-rank methods are an important part of the tool box
for researchers studying populations of graphs in general, and statistical

simulations provide a powerful technique to characterize the response of
small-scale observables to the long-wavelength density fluctuations, for

squeezed-limit $n$-point function and halo bias, respectively. Using
quintessence dark energy as the paradigmatic example, we extend these
simulation techniques to cases where non-gravitational forces in other sectors
establish a Jeans scale across which the growth of density fluctuations becomes
scale dependent. By characterizing the separate universes with matching
background expansion histories, we show that the power spectrum and mass
function responses depend on whether the long-wavelength mode is above or below
the Jeans scale. Correspondingly, the squeezed bispectrum and halo bias also
become scale dependent. Models of bias that are effectively local in the
density field at a single epoch, initial or observed, cannot describe this
effect which highlights the importance of temporal nonlocality in structure
formation. Validated by these quintessence tests, our techniques are applicable
to a wide range of models where the complex dynamics of additional fields
affect the clustering of matter in the linear regime and it would otherwise be

nonperturbative proof of a universal relation whereby quantities computable in
the SU(2) case completely determine the virial coefficients of the SU($N_f$)
case. These one-dimensional systems are appealing because they can be
experimentally realized in highly constrained traps and because of the dominant
role played by correlations. The latter are typically nonperturbative and are
crucial for understanding ground states and quantum phase transitions. While
quantum fluctuations are typically overpowered by thermal ones in one and two
dimensions at any finite temperature, we find that quantum effects do leave
their imprint in thermodynamic quantities. Our calculations show that the
additional degrees of freedom, relative to the SU(2) case, provide a dramatic
enhancement of the density and pressure (in units of their noninteracting
counterparts) in a wide region around vanishing $\beta\mu$, where $\beta$ is
the inverse temperature and $\mu$ the chemical potential. As shown recently in

(OTOC) may serve as a useful characteristic of quantum-chaotic behavior,
because in the semi-classical limit, $\hbar \to 0$, its rate of exponential
growth resembles the classical Lyapunov exponent. Here, we calculate the
four-point correlator, $C(t)$, for the classical and quantum kicked rotor -- a
textbook driven chaotic system -- and compare its growth rate at initial times
with the standard definition of the classical Lyapunov exponent. Using both
quantum and classical arguments, we show that the OTOC's growth rate and the
Lyapunov exponent are in general distinct quantities, corresponding to the
logarithm of phase-space averaged divergence rate of classical trajectories and
to the phase-space average of the logarithm, respectively. The difference
appears to be more pronounced in the regime of low kicking strength $K$, where
no classical chaos exists globally. In this case, the Lyapunov exponent quickly
decreases as $K \to 0$, while the OTOC's growth rate may decrease much slower
showing higher sensitivity to small chaotic islands in the phase space. We also
show that the quantum correlator as a function of time exhibits a clear
singularity at the Ehrenfest time $t_E$: transitioning from a time-independent
value of $t^{-1} \ln{C(t)}$ at $t < t_E$ to its monotonous decrease with time
at $t>t_E$. We note that the underlying physics here is the same as in the
theory of weak (dynamical) localization [Aleiner and Larkin, Phys. Rev. B 54,

misspecification are not sufficiently understood. There are sound reasons
behind this assumption, particularly for large $p$: ease of interpretation,
analytical and computational convenience. More flexible frameworks exist,
including semi- or non-parametric models, often at the cost of some
tractability. We propose a simple extension of the Normal model that allows for
skewness and thicker-than-normal tails but preserves tractability. It leads to
easy interpretation and a log-concave likelihood that facilitates optimization
and integration. We characterize asymptotically parameter estimation and Bayes
factor rates, in particular studying the effects of model misspecification.
Under suitable conditions misspecified Bayes factors are consistent and induce
sparsity at the same asymptotic rates than under the correct model. However,
the rates to detect signal are altered by an exponential factor, often
resulting in a loss of sensitivity. These deficiencies can be ameliorated by
inferring the error distribution from the data, a simple strategy that can
improve inference substantially. Our work focuses on the likelihood and can
thus be combined with any likelihood penalty or prior, but here we focus on
non-local priors to induce extra sparsity and ameliorate finite-sample effects
caused by misspecification. Our results highlight the practical importance of

operators on one hand, and doubly periodic generalized functions on the other.
The linear map that implements it, referred to as the Q-transform, enables a
direct application of the classical Harmonic Analysis in a study of quantum
systems. In particular, the Q-transform makes it possible to reinterpret the
dynamic of a quantum observable as a (typically nonlocal) dynamic of a
classical observable. From this point of view we carry out an analysis of an
open quantum system whose dynamics are governed by an asymptotically harmonic
Hamiltonian and compact type Lindblad operators. It is established that the
initial value problem of the equivalent nonlocal but classical evolution is
well posed in the appropriately chosen Sobolev spaces.
  The second set of results pertains to a generalization of the basic
Q-transform and highlights a certain type of asymptotic redundancy. This
phenomenon, referred to as the broadband redundancy, is a consequence of a
well-known property of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, namely, the
uniform distribution modulo one of their ordinates. Its relevance to the
analysis of quantum dynamics is only a special instance of its utility in
harmonic analysis in general. It remains to be seen if the phenomenon is
significant also in the physical sense, but it appears well-justified---in
particular, by the results presented here---to pose such a question.

an unprecedented number of redshifts, currently dominate large-scale structure
studies. However, physical constraints limit these surveys from successfully
collecting redshifts from galaxies too close to each other on the focal plane.
This ultimately leads to significant systematic effects on galaxy clustering
measurements. Using simulated mock catalogs, we demonstrate that fiber
collisions have a significant impact on the power spectrum, $P(k)$, monopole
and quadrupole that exceeds sample variance at scales smaller than
$k\sim0.1~h/Mpc$.
  We present two methods to account for fiber collisions in the power spectrum.
The first, statistically reconstructs the clustering of fiber collided galaxy
pairs by modeling the distribution of the line-of-sight displacements between
them. It also properly accounts for fiber collisions in the shot-noise
correction term of the $P(k)$ estimator. Using this method, we recover the true
$P(k)$ monopole of the mock catalogs with residuals of $<0.5\%$ at
$k=0.3~h/Mpc$ and $<4\%$ at $k=0.83~h/Mpc$ -- a significant improvement over
existing correction methods. The quadrupole, however, does not improve
significantly.
  The second method models the effect of fiber collisions on the power spectrum
as a convolution with a configuration space top-hat function that depends on
the physical scale of fiber collisions. It directly computes theoretical
predictions of the fiber-collided $P(k)$ multipoles and reduces the influence
of smaller scales to a set of nuisance parameters. Using this method, we
reliably model the effect of fiber collisions on the monopole and quadrupole
down to the scale limits of theoretical predictions. The methods we present in
this paper will allow us to robustly analyze galaxy power spectrum multipole
measurements to much smaller scales than previously possible.

galactic nuclei are some of the most promising gravitational wave (GWs) sources
for next generation GW-detectors. The rates of such extreme mass ratio
inspirals (EMRIs) depend on the dynamics and distribution of compact objects
around the MBH. Here we study the impact of mass-segregation processes on EMRI
rates. In particular, we provide the expected mass function of EMRIs, given an
initial mass function of stellar BHs (SBHs), and relate it to the
mass-dependent detection rate of EMRIs. We then consider the role of star
formation on the distribution of compact objects and its implication on EMRI
rates. We find that the existence of a wide spectrum of SBH masses lead to the
overall increase of EMRI rates, and to high rates of the EMRIs from the
most-massive SBHs. However, it also leads to a relative quenching of EMRI rates
from lower-mass SBHs, and together produces a steep dependence of the EMRI mass
function on the highest-mass SBHs. Star-formation history plays a relatively
small role in determining the EMRI rates of SBHs, since most of them migrate
close to the MBH through mass-segregation rather than forming in-situ. However,
the EMRI rate of neutron stars can be significantly increased when they form
in-situ close to the MBH, as they can inspiral before relaxation processes
significantly segregates them outwards. A reverse but weaker effect of
decreasing the EMRI rates from neutron stars and white dwarfs occurs when
star-formation proceeds far from the MBH.

range (IQR) of magnitude measurements, sensitive to variability irrespective of
a time-scale and resistant to outliers. It can be complemented by the ratio of
the lightcurve variance to the mean square successive difference, 1/h, which is
efficient in detecting variability on time-scales longer than the typical time
interval between observations. Variable objects have larger 1/h and/or IQR
values than non-variable objects of similar brightness. Another approach to
variability detection is to combine many variability indices using principal
component analysis. We present 124 previously unknown variable stars found in

fully takes into account of the contribution of multiple scattering whereas the
KB approximation calculates only single scattered intensity and multiple
scattering components are approximated. We find that the KB approximation gives
fairly accurate results if optically thin, face-on galaxies are considered.
However, for highly inclined ($i \gtrsim 85^{\circ}$) and/or optically thick
(central face-on optical depth $\gtrsim1$) galaxy models, the approximation can
give rise to substantial errors, sometimes, up to $\gtrsim 40\%$. Moreover, it
is also found that the KB approximation is not always physical, sometimes
producing infinite intensities at lines of sight with high optical depth in
edge-on galaxy models. There is no ""simple recipe"" to correct the errors of the
KB approximation that is universally applicable to any galaxy models.
Therefore, it is recommended that the full radiative transfer calculation be
used, even though it's slower than the KB approximation.

supernova kicks and >50% after dynamical evolution). Yet all model clusters
have the same amount of mass segregation in terms of the decline of the mean
mass of stars and remnants with distance to the centre. We also discuss how
kinematics can be used to further constrain the presence of a stellar-mass
black hole population and distinguish it from the effect of an
intermediate-mass black hole. Our results imply that the kick velocities of
black holes are lower than those of neutron stars. The large retention fraction

the effect of defects on the electronic structure and transport properties of

flow of charge changes between the topologically protected edge and bulk states
and show that elastically and inelastically scattering defects that preserve
the time reversal symmetry of the TI lead to qualitatively different effects on
the TI's local electronic structure and its transport properties. Moreover, we
show that the recently predicted ability to create highly spin-polarized
currents by breaking the time-reversal symmetry of the TI via magnetic defects
[Phys. Rev. B 93, 081401 (2016)] is robust against the inclusion of a Rashba
spin-orbit interaction and the effects of dephasing, and remains unaffected by
changes over a wide range of the TI's parameters. We discuss how the sign of
the induced spin currents changes under symmetry operations, such as reversal
of bias and gate voltages, or spatial reflections. Finally, we show that the
insight into the interplay between topology and symmetry of the magnetic
defects can be employed for the creation of novel quantum phenomena, such as
highly localized magnetic fields inside the TI.

significant amount of information. We propose a new statistic, the probability
distribution of voxel intensities, which can access this extra information.
Using a model of a CO intensity map at $z\sim3$ as an example, we demonstrate
that this voxel intensity distribution (VID) provides substantial constraining
power beyond what is obtainable from the power spectrum alone. We find that a
future survey similar to the planned COMAP Full experiment could constrain the

dwarfs (WDs) showcase the importance of modeling the long-term evolution of
small bodies in exosystems. WD debris discs are in particular thought to form
from very long-term (0.1-5.0 Gyr) instability between planets and asteroids.
However, the time-consuming nature of $N$-body integrators which accurately
simulate motion over Gyrs necessitates a judicious choice of initial
conditions. The analytical tools known as \textit{periodic orbits} can
circumvent the guesswork. Here, we begin a comprehensive analysis directly
linking periodic orbits with $N$-body integration outcomes with an extensive
exploration of the planar circular restricted three-body problem (CRTBP) with
an outer planet and inner asteroid near or inside of the $2$:$1$ mean motion
resonance. We run nearly 1000 focused simulations for the entire age of the
Universe (14 Gyr) with initial conditions mapped to the phase space locations
surrounding the unstable and stable periodic orbits for that commensurability.
In none of our simulations did the planar CRTBP architecture yield a
long-timescale ($\gtrsim 0.25$% of the age of the Universe) asteroid-star
collision. The pericentre distance of asteroids which survived beyond this
timescale ($\approx 35$ Myr) varied by at most about 60%. These results help
affirm that collisions occur too quickly to explain WD pollution in the planar
CRTBP $2$:$1$ regime, and highlight the need for further periodic orbit studies
with the eccentric and inclined TBP architectures and other significant orbital
period commensurabilities.

that low ionisation emission line regions (LIERs) in local galaxies result from
photoionisation by hot evolved stars, not active galactic nuclei. LIERs are
ubiquitous in both quiescent galaxies and in the central regions of galaxies
where star formation takes place at larger radii. We refer to these two classes
of galaxies as extended LIER (eLIER) and central LIER (cLIER) galaxies
respectively. cLIERs are late type galaxies located around the green valley, in
the transition region between the star formation main sequence and quiescent
galaxies. These galaxies display regular disc rotation in both stars and gas,
although featuring a higher central stellar velocity dispersion than star
forming galaxies of the same mass. cLIERs are consistent with being slowly
quenched inside-out; the transformation is associated with massive bulges,
pointing towards the importance of bulge growth via secular evolution. eLIERs
are morphologically early types and are indistinguishable from passive galaxies
devoid of line emission in terms of their stellar populations, morphology and
central stellar velocity dispersion. Ionised gas in eLIERs shows both disturbed
and disc-like kinematics. When a large-scale flow/rotation is observed in the
gas, it is often misaligned relative to the stellar component. These features
indicate that eLIERs are passive galaxies harbouring a residual cold gas
component, acquired mostly via external accretion. Importantly, quiescent
galaxies devoid of line emission reside in denser environments and have
significantly higher satellite fraction than eLIERs. Environmental effects thus
represent the likely cause for the existence of line-less galaxies on the red
sequence.

equally well described by a simple model in which the disk angular momentum is
just enough to maintain marginally stable disks. We extracted evolutionary

exhibits a normal morphology, peaking at the galaxy center, whereas [OI] is
concentrated close to the GRB position and the nearby Wolf-Rayet region. The
high [OI] flux indicates high radiation field and gas density. The [CII]/CO
luminosity ratio of the GRB 980425 host is close to the highest values found

its SFR and metallicity, but the [CII]-derived molecular gas mass is close to
the expected value. The [OI] and HI concentrations, and the high radiation
field and density are consistent with the hypothesis of a very recent (at most
a few tens of Myr ago) inflow of atomic gas triggering star formation. Dust has
not had time to build up (explaining high line-to-continuum ratios). Such a
recent enhancement of star-formation would indeed manifest itself in high
SFR_line/SFR_continuum ratios, because the line indicators are sensitive only
to recent (<10 Myr) activity, whereas the continuum indicators measure the SFR
averaged over much longer periods (~100 Myr). Other GRB hosts exhibit a mean
SFR_line/SFR_continuum of 1.74+-0.32. This is consistent with a very recent
enhancement of star formation being common among GRB hosts, so galaxies which
have recently experienced inflow of gas may preferentially host stars exploding

Our main contribution is a CNN cascaded architecture specifically designed for
learning part relationships and spatial context, and robustly inferring pose
even for the case of severe part occlusions. To this end, we propose a
detection-followed-by-regression CNN cascade. The first part of our cascade
outputs part detection heatmaps and the second part performs regression on
these heatmaps. The benefits of the proposed architecture are multi-fold: It
guides the network where to focus in the image and effectively encodes part
constraints and context. More importantly, it can effectively cope with
occlusions because part detection heatmaps for occluded parts provide low
confidence scores which subsequently guide the regression part of our network
to rely on contextual information in order to predict the location of these
parts. Additionally, we show that the proposed cascade is flexible enough to
readily allow the integration of various CNN architectures for both detection
and regression, including recent ones based on residual learning. Finally, we
illustrate that our cascade achieves top performance on the MPII and LSP data
sets. Code can be downloaded from http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psxab5/

black holes in four- and higher-dimensional spacetime. We impose a set of
restrictions, such as a regularity of the metric at the center $r=0$ and
Schwarzschild asymptotic behavior at large $r$. We assume that the metric
besides mass $M$ contains an additional parameter $\ell$, which determines the
scale where modification of the solution of the Einstein equations becomes
significant. We require that the modified metric obeys the limiting curvature
condition, that is its curvature is uniformly restricted by the value $\sim
\ell^{-2}$. We also make a ""more technical"" assumption that the metric
coefficients are rational functions of $r$. In particular, the invariant
$(\nabla r)^2$ has the form $P_n(r)/\tilde{P}_n(r)$, where $P_n$ and
$\tilde{P}_n$ are polynomials of the order of $n$. We discuss first the case of
four dimensions. We show that when $n\le 2$ such a metric cannot describe a
non-singular black hole. For $n=3$ we find a suitable metric, which besides $M$
and $\ell$ contains a dimensionless numerical parameter. When this parameter
vanishes the obtained metric coincides with Hayward's one. The characteristic
property of such spacetimes is $-\xi^2=(\nabla r)^2$, where $\xi^2$ is a
time-like at infinity Killing vector. We describe a possible generalization of
a non-singular black-hole metric to the case when this equality is violated. We
also obtain a metric for a charged non-singular black hole obeying similar
restrictions as the neutral one, and construct higher dimensional models of
neutral and charged black holes.

tunings that control the miner. Objective:We seek simple, automatic, and very
effective method for finding those tunings. Method: For each experiment with
different data sets (from open source JAVA systems), we ran differential
evolution as anoptimizer to explore the tuning space (as a first step) then
tested the tunings using hold-out data. Results: Contrary to our prior
expectations, we found these tunings were remarkably simple: it only required
tens, not thousands,of attempts to obtain very good results. For example, when
learning software defect predictors, this method can quickly find tuningsthat
alter detection precision from 0% to 60%. Conclusion: Since (1) the
improvements are so large, and (2) the tuning is so simple, we need to change
standard methods insoftware analytics. At least for defect prediction, it is no
longer enough to just run a data miner and present the resultwithoutconducting
a tuning optimization study. The implication for other kinds of analytics is
now an open and pressing issue

algebras in a unifying fashion. Affine cellular algebras include Kleshchev's
graded quasihereditary algebras, KLR algebras and various other classes of
algebras. In this paper we will study ring theoretical properties of affine
cellular algebras. We show that any affine cellular algebra $A$ satisfies a
polynomial identity. Furthermore, we show that $A$ can be embedded into its
asymptotic algebra if the occurring commutative affine algebra $B_j$ are
reduced and the determinants of the swich matrices are non-zero divisors. As a
consequence, we show that the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of $A$ is less than or
equal to the largest Krull dimension of the algebras $B_j$ and that equality
hold, in case all affine cell ideals are idempotent or if the Krull dimension
of the algebras $B_j$ is less than or equal to $1$. Special emphasis is given
to the question when an affine cell ideal is idempotent, generated by an
idempotent or finitely generated.

classical standard errors exposes model misspecification. We emphasize that
KR's claim only generally applies to parametric models: models that assume a
restrictive form of the distribution of the outcome. Many common models in use
in political science, including the linear model, are not necessarily
parametric -- rather they may be semiparametric. Common estimators of model
parameters such as ordinary least squares have both robust (corresponding to a
semiparametric model) and classical (corresponding to a more restrictive model)
standard error estimates. Given a properly specified semiparametric model and
mild regularity conditions, the classical standard errors are not generally
consistent, but the robust standard errors are. To illustrate this point, we
consider the case of the regression estimate of a semiparametric linear model
with no model misspecification, and show that robust standard errors may
nevertheless systematically differ from classical standard errors. We show that
a disagreement between robust and classical standard errors is not generally
suitable as a diagnostic for regression estimators, and that KR's reanalyses of
Neumayer (2003) and B\""uthe and Milner (2008) are predicated on strong

emission, and (b) filtering short spacial frequencies in the Fourier plane to
remove large scale emission. One of the brightest features to the East of the
shell of Puppis A was found to be a background source, probably extragalactic.
Removing the contribution from this and the previously known unrelated sources,
the systemic velocity of Puppis A turns out to be limited between 8 and 12 km
s$^{-1}$, which places this source at a distance of 1.3 $\pm$ 0.3 kpc. From the

kpc. The main consequences of the new systemic velocity and distance as

dependency of magnetic field growth as a function of the distribution of
kinetic and magnetic helicities among the three interacting wavenumbers. By
combining direct numerical simulations of the full magnetohydrodynamics
equations with the helical Fourier decomposition we numerically confirm that in
the kinematic dynamo regime the system develops a large-scale magnetic helicity
with opposite sign compared to the small-scale kinetic helicity, a sort of
triad-by-triad $\alpha$-effect in Fourier space. Concerning the small-scale
perturbations, we predict theoretically and confirm numerically that the
largest instability is achieved for the magnetic component with the same
helicity of the flow, in agreement with the Stretch-Twist-Fold mechanism. Vice
versa, in presence of a Lorentz feedback on the velocity, we find that the
inverse cascade of magnetic helicity is mostly local if magnetic and kinetic
helicities have opposite sign, while it is more nonlocal and more intense if
they have the same sign, as predicted by the analytical approach. Our
analytical and numerical results further demonstrate the potential of the

symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ are the permutohedron $P_n$ and the Birkhoff
polytope $B_n$. We consider polytopes $P_n(\Pi)$ and $B_n(\Pi)$, whose vertices
correspond to the permutations in $\mathfrak{S}_n$ avoiding a set of patterns
$\Pi$. For various choices of $\Pi$, we explore the Ehrhart polynomials and
$h^*$-vectors of these polytopes as well as other aspects of their
combinatorial structure.
  For $P_n(\Pi)$, we consider all subsets $\Pi \subseteq \mathfrak{S}_3$ and
are able to provide results in most cases. To illustrate, $P_n(123,132)$ is a
Pitman-Stanley polytope, the number of interior lattice points in
$P_n(132,312)$ is a derangement number, and the normalized volume of
$P_n(123,231,312)$ is the number of trees on $n$ vertices.
  The polytopes $B_n(\Pi)$ seem much more difficult to analyze, so we focus on
four particular choices of $\Pi$. First we show that the $B_n(231,321)$ is
exactly the Chan-Robbins-Yuen polytope. Next we prove that for any $\Pi$
containing $\{123,312\}$ we have $h^*(B_n(\Pi))=1$. Finally, we study
$B_n(132,312)$ and $\widetilde{B}_n(123)$, where the tilde indicates that we
choose vertices corresponding to alternating permutations avoiding the pattern
$123$. In both cases we use order complexes of posets and techniques from toric
algebra to construct regular, unimodular triangulations of the polytopes. The
posets involved turn out to be isomorphic to the lattices of Young diagrams
contained in a certain shape, and this permits us to give an exact expression
for the normalized volumes of the corresponding polytopes via the hook formula.
Finally, Stanley's theory of $(P,\omega)$-partitions allows us to show that
their $h^*$-vectors are symmetric and unimodal.
  Various questions and conjectures are presented throughout.

relies on coagulation from a mixture of sub-Mars sized planetary embryos and
(smaller) planetesimals that dynamically emerge from the evolving circum-solar
disc in the first few million years of our Solar System. Once the planets have,
for the most part, assembled after a giant impact phase, they continue to be
bombarded by a multitude of planetesimals left over from accretion. Here we
place limits on the mass and evolution of these planetesimals based on
constraints from the highly siderophile element (HSE) budget of the Moon.
Outcomes from a combination of N-body and Monte Carlo simulations of planet
formation lead us to four key conclusions about the nature of this early epoch.
First, matching the terrestrial to lunar HSE ratio requires either that the
late veneer on Earth consisted of a single lunar-size impactor striking the
Earth before 4.45 Ga, or that it originated from the impact that created the
Moon. An added complication is that analysis of lunar samples indicates the
Moon does not preserve convincing evidence for a late veneer like Earth.
Second, the expected chondritic veneer component on Mars is 0.06 weight
percent. Third, the flux of terrestrial impactors must have been low (
<=10^(-6) M_earth/Myr) to avoid wholesale melting of Earth's crust after
4.4~Ga, and to simultaneously match the number of observed lunar basins. This
conclusion leads to an Hadean eon which is more clement than assumed
previously. Last, after the terrestrial planets had fully formed, the mass in
remnant planetesimals was ~10^(-3) M_earth, lower by at least an order of
magnitude than most previous models suggest. Our dynamically and geochemically
self-consistent scenario requires that future N-body simulations of rocky
planet formation either directly incorporate collisional grinding or rely on
pebble accretion.

set of scientific hypotheses with statistical analysis, researchers can now
test many possible relations and let P-values or other statistical summaries
generate hypotheses for them. Genetic epidemiology field is an illustrative
case in this paradigm shift. Driven by technological advances, testing a
handful of genetic variants in relation to a health outcome has been abandoned
in favor of agnostic screening of the entire genome, followed by selection of
top hits, e.g., by selection of genetic variants with the smallest association
P-values. At the same time, nearly total lack of replication of claimed
associations that has been shaming the field turned to a flow of reports whose
findings have been robustly replicating. Researchers may have adopted better
statistical practices by learning from past failures, but we suggest that a
steep increase in the amount of statistical testing itself is an important
factor. Regardless of whether statistical significance has been reached, an
increased number of tested hypotheses leads to enrichment of smallest P-values
with genuine associations. In this study, we quantify how the expected
proportion of genuine signals (EPGS) among top hits changes with an increasing
number of tests. When the rate of occurrence of genuine signals does not
decrease too sharply to zero as more tests are performed, the smallest P-values
are increasingly more likely to represent genuine associations in studies with

that are the sizes of its models. The class of finite spectra is known to be
the same as the complexity class NE. We consider the spectra obtained by
limiting models to be either planar (in the graph-theoretic sense) or by
bounding the degree of elements. We show that the class of such spectra is
still surprisingly rich by establishing that significant fragments of NE are
included among them. At the same time, we establish non-trivial upper bounds
showing that not all sets in NE are obtained as planar or bounded-degree

across a range of temporal and spacial scales. While our understanding of those
processes at single scales has increased exponentially over the last few years,
a mechanistic understanding of the entire phenomenon has remained elusive. We
propose that progress has been stymied by the lack of a quantitative framework
that can account for the full range of neurophysiological and behavioral
dynamics both across scales in the systems and also across different types of
learning. We posit that network neuroscience offers promise in meeting this
challenge. Built on the mathematical fields of complex systems science and
graph theory, network neuroscience embraces the interconnected and hierarchical
nature of human learning, offering insights into the emergent properties of
adaptability. In this review, we discuss the utility of network neuroscience as
a tool to build a quantitative framework in which to study human learning,
which seeks to explain the full chain of events in the brain from sensory input
to motor output, being both biologically plausible and able to make predictions
about how an intervention at a single level of the chain may cause alterations
in another level of the chain. We close by laying out important remaining
challenges in network neuroscience in explicitly bridging spatial scales at
which neurophysiological processes occur, and underscore the utility of such a
quantitative framework for education and therapy.

estimation of the noise affecting multiple qubits coupled to Gaussian dephasing
environments including both classical and quantum sources. Our protocols are
capable of reconstructing all the noise auto- and cross-correlation spectra
entering the multiqubit dynamics. We argue that this capability is crucial not
only for metrological purposes, as it provides access to the asymmetric spectra
associated with non-classical environments, but ultimately for achieving
quantum fault-tolerance, as it enables the characterization of bath correlation
functions. Our result relies on (i) an exact analytic solution for the reduced
multiqubit dynamics that holds in the presence of an arbitrary Gaussian
environment and dephasing-preserving control; (ii) the use of specific timing
symmetries in the control, which allow for a frequency comb to be engineered
for all filter functions of interest, and for the spectra to be related to
experimentally accessible qubit observables. We show that quantum spectra have
distinctive dynamical signatures, which we explore in two paradigmatic
open-system models describing spin and charge qubits coupled to bosonic
environments. Complete multiqubit noise spectroscopy is demonstrated
numerically in a realistic setting consisting of two-exciton qubits coupled to
a phonon bath. The estimated spectra allow us to accurately predict the exciton

columns of a matrix. Ideally, given the leverage scores of a rank-$r$ matrix
$M\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, that matrix can be reliably completed from just
$O(rn\log^{2}n)$ samples if the samples are chosen randomly from a nonuniform
distribution induced by the leverage scores. In practice, however, the leverage
scores are often unknown a priori. As such, the sample complexity in uniform
matrix completion---using uniform random sampling---increases to
$O(\eta(M)\cdot rn\log^{2}n)$, where $\eta(M)$ is the largest leverage score of
$M$. In this paper, we propose a two-phase algorithm called MC$^2$ for matrix
completion: in the first phase, the leverage scores are estimated based on
uniform random samples, and then in the second phase the matrix is resampled
nonuniformly based on the estimated leverage scores and then completed. For
well-conditioned matrices, the total sample complexity of MC$^2$ is no worse
than uniform matrix completion, and for certain classes of well-conditioned
matrices---namely, reasonably coherent matrices whose leverage scores exhibit
mild decay---MC$^2$ requires substantially fewer samples. Numerical simulations
suggest that the algorithm outperforms uniform matrix completion in a broad
class of matrices, and in particular, is much less sensitive to the condition
number than our theory currently requires.

is prohibitive for such large wireless systems, approximate methods are
necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel data detection algorithm referred
to as Triangular Approximate SEmidefinite Relaxation (TASER), which is suitable
for two application scenarios: (i) coherent data detection in large multi-user
multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) wireless systems and (ii) joint

near-ML error-rate performance at low complexity by relaxing the associated
ML-detection problems into a semidefinite program, which we solve approximately
using a preconditioned forward-backward splitting procedure. Since the
resulting problem is non-convex, we provide convergence guarantees for our
algorithm. To demonstrate the efficacy of TASER in practice, we design a
systolic architecture that enables our algorithm to achieve high throughput at
low hardware complexity, and we develop reference field-programmable gate array
(FPGA) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs for various
antenna configurations.

satellites mass segregation in galaxy groups using the Galaxy And Mass Assembly

hydrodynamical simulation catalogues of galaxy groups. We select groups with
halo mass $12 \leqslant \log(M_{\text{halo}}/h^{-1}M_\odot) <14.5$ and redshift
$z \leqslant 0.32$ and probe the radial distribution of stellar mass out to
twice the group virial radius. All the samples are carefully constructed to be
complete in stellar mass at each redshift range and efforts are made to
regularise the analysis for all the data. Our study shows negligible mass
segregation in galaxy group environments with absolute gradients of
$\lesssim0.08$ dex and also shows a lack of any redshift evolution. Moreover,
we find that our results at least for the GAMA data are robust to different
halo mass and group centre estimates. Furthermore, the EAGLE data allows us to
probe much fainter luminosities ($r$-band magnitude of 22) as well as
investigate the three-dimensional spatial distribution with intrinsic halo
properties, beyond what the current observational data can offer. In both cases
we find that the fainter EAGLE data show a very mild spatial mass segregation
at $z \leqslant 0.22$, which is again not apparent at higher redshift.
Interestingly, our results are in contrast to some earlier findings using the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We investigate the source of the disagreement and
suggest that subtle differences between the group finding algorithms could be
the root cause.

intervenes between the phase of slab nuclei and the outer core of uniform
nuclear matter, torsional oscillations in the bubble phase can be excited
separately from usual crustal torsional oscillations. We find from eigenmode
analyses for various models of the equation of state of uniform nuclear matter
that the fundamental frequencies of such oscillations are almost independent of
the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter, but strongly depend on the
slope parameter of the nuclear symmetry energy $L$. Although the frequencies
are also sensitive to the entrainment effect, i.e., what portion of nucleons
outside bubbles contribute to the oscillations, by having such a portion fixed,
we can successfully fit the calculated fundamental frequencies of torsional
oscillations in the bubble phase inside a star of specific mass and radius as a
function of $L$. By comparing the resultant fitting formula to the frequencies
of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed from the soft-gamma repeaters,
we find that each of the observed low-frequency QPOs can be identified either
as a torsional oscillation in the bubble phase or as a usual crustal
oscillation, given generally accepted values of $L$ for all the stellar models

finitely many random variables is likely to introduce a bias. We overcome this
challenge by rewriting the tail probability of interest as a sum of a random
number of telescoping terms, and subsequently developing conditional Monte

resulting algorithm is proved to result in estimators that a) have no bias, and
b) require only a fixed, finite number of replications irrespective of how rare

reduction technique such as conditional Monte Carlo with more recent use of
auxiliary randomization to remove bias in a multi-level type representation, we
develop an efficient and unbiased simulation algorithm for tail probabilities

paper describes how to automate the microscopic pedestrian flow data collection

considering vehicular - pedestrian interaction. Pedestrian tracking system
consists of three sub-systems, which calculates the image processing, object
tracking and traffic flow variables. The system receives input of stacks of
images and parameters. The first sub-system performs Image Processing analysis
while the second sub-system carries out the tracking of pedestrians by matching
the features and tracing the pedestrian numbers frame by frame. The last
sub-system deals with a NTXY database to calculate the pedestrian traffic-flow
characteristic such as flow rate, speed and area module. Comparison with manual

distribution $F$ into a set of representative points called support points.
These points are obtained by minimizing the energy distance, a statistical
potential measure initially proposed by Sz\'ekely and Rizzo (2004) for testing
goodness-of-fit. The energy distance has two appealing features. First, its
distance-based structure allows us to exploit the duality between powers of the
Euclidean distance and its Fourier transform for theoretical analysis. Using
this duality, we show that support points converge in distribution to $F$, and
enjoy an improved error rate to Monte Carlo for integrating a large class of
functions. Second, the minimization of the energy distance can be formulated as
a difference-of-convex program, which we manipulate using two algorithms to
efficiently generate representative point sets. In simulation studies, support
points provide improved integration performance to both Monte Carlo and a
specific Quasi-Monte Carlo method. Two important applications of support points
are then highlighted: (a) as a way to quantify the propagation of uncertainty
in expensive simulations, and (b) as a method to optimally compact Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples in Bayesian computation.

source engine TORCS and used to analyze the basic features of human behavior in
car driving within the car-following setups. Eight subjects with different
skill in driving real cars participated in these experiments. They were
instructed to drive a virtual car without overtaking the lead car driven by
computer at a fixed speed and not to lose sight of it. Moreover, these
experiments were conducted with four different speed including 60km/h, 80km/h,
100km/h, and 120km/h. Based on the collected data the distribution of the
headway, velocity, acceleration, and jerk are constructed and compared with
available experimental data collected previously by the analysis of the real
traffic flow. A new model for car-following is proposed capture the found
properties. As the main results we draw a conclusion that the human behavior in
car driving should be categorized as a generalized intermittent control with
noise-driven activation of the active phase. Besides, we hypothesize that the
extended phase space required for modeling human actions in car driving has to
comprise four phase variables, namely, the headway distance, the velocity of
car, its acceleration, and the car jerk, i.e., the time derivative of the car
acceleration. This time, the time pattern of pedal pushing and the distribution
of time derivative of pedal was utilized in addition to previous variables.
Moreover, all subjects' driving data were categorized as some styles with their

stamina, endurance, mental toughness and overall strength. At every step, the
foot experiences ground reaction forces necessary to support the motion of the
body. With the advancements in shoe technology, running shoes have grown in
popularity among runners, as well as non-runners, because they reduce the risk
of injuries from the impact felt by the foot. The purpose of this report is to
analyze the effect of running shoes on impact forces on the foot. This is
achieved through the use of three force pads fixed at different locations on
the foot The force measured by each sensor is then used to estimate the
vertical ground reaction force, using the sensors' calibrations equations .
Based on the ground reaction force, the effective mass corresponding to the
momentum change occurring during the transient phase of the impact is
estimated. The results show that running at 9 miles per hour without running
shoes generates an effective mass of (14.9 +/- 4.8)% of the total body mass,
while running at the same speed with running shoes generates an effective mass
of (7.8 +/- 1.5 )% of the total body mass. The values highlight a significant
reduction in the risk of pain or injuries accomplished by wearing running shoes

temperature, velocity, and OPR within the observed area imply motion of the

these results with PDR models in the literature covering a range of densities

one of major issues is the apparent contradiction between linear stability
analysis quoting a flow to be stable and results from experiments and
simulations proving it to be otherwise. There is some success, in particular in
astrophysical systems, based on Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI). However,
MRI requires the system to be weakly magnetized, which is not a feature of
general magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows. Nevertheless, linear perturbations of
such flows are nonnormal in nature which argues for an origin of nonlinearity
therein. The idea is, nonnormal perturbations could produce huge transient
energy growth (TEG), which may lead to non-linearity and further turbulence.
However, so far, nonnormal effects in shear flows have not been explored much
in the presence of magnetic fields. Here, we consider the perturbed
visco-resistive incompressible MHD shear flows with rotation in general.
Basically we consider the magnetized version of Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire
equations and their magnetic analogues in the presence of Coriolis effect. We
solve the equations using a pseudospectral eigenvalue approach. We investigate
the possible emergence of instability and large TEG in three different flows:
the Keplerian, constant angular momentum and plane Couette flows. We show that,
above a certain value of magnetic field, instability and TEG both stop
occurring. We also show that TEG is maximum near the regions of instability in
the wave number space for a given magnetic field and Reynolds number. Rotating
shear flows are ubiquitous in astrophysics, especially accretion disks, where
molecular viscosity is too low to account for observed data. The primary
accepted cause of energy-momentum transport therein is turbulent viscosity.
Hence, these results would have important implications in astrophysics.

trivial Rashba-like states that change topology through the spin-orbit-induced

because spirals with opposite chirality coexist. Sizable anharmonic modulations
emerge in this incommensurate structure, which are accompanied by large

magnetoelastic coupling, a reduction of the $b$ lattice parameter, is thus
associated only with the commensurate order. Upon releasing the field at low

methods to constrain cosmological parameters, scaling as the amplitude
$\sigma_8^8$. It is determined by the integral over the halo mass function
multiplied by the total pressure content of clusters, and further convolved by
the cluster gas pressure profile. It has been shown that various feedback
effects can change significantly the pressure profile, possibly even pushing
the gas out to the virial radius and beyond, strongly affecting the tSZ power
spectrum at high $l$. Energetics arguments and SZ-halo mass scaling relations
suggest feedback is unlikely to significantly change the total pressure
content, making low $l$ tSZ power spectrum more robust against feedback
effects. Furthermore, the separation between the cosmic infrared background
(CIB) and tSZ is more reliable at low $l$. Low $l$ modes are however probing
very small volumes, giving rise to very large non-gaussian sampling variance
errors. By computing the trispectrum contribution we identify $90<l<350$ as the
minimum variance scale where the combined error is minimized. Using the
measurement at this $l$ provides constraints that are almost as strong as using
the entire power spectrum. We extend the work by the Planck collaboration by
including a full trispectrum and feedback effects in the analysis. We perform a
Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis over the two dimensional parameter space and
find constraints on $\sigma_8$ by marginalizing over the feedback nuisance
parameter.We obtain $\sigma_8
=0.820^{+0.021}_{-0.009}\left(\Omega_m/0.31\right)^{0.4}$, when fixing other
parameters to Planck cosmology values. Our results suggest it is possible to
obtain competitive cosmological constraints from tSZ without cluster redshift
information, and that the current tSZ power spectrum shows no evidence for a
low amplitude of $\sigma_8$.

PhD thesis, Stanford Univ",,,,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Condensed matter systems are complex yet simple. Amidst their complexity, one
often find order specified by not more than a few parameters. Key to such a
reductionistic description is an appropriate choice of basis, two of which I
shall describe in this thesis.
  The first, an exact mapping known as the Wannier State Representation (WSR),
provides an exact Hilbert space correspondence between two intensely-studied
topological systems, the Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) and Fractional Chern
Insulator (FCI) systems. FQH states exist within the partially filled Landau
levels of interacting 2D electron gases under strong magnetic fields, where
quasiparticles exhibit topologically nontrivial braiding statistics. FCI
systems, which are novel lattice realizations of FQH systems without orbital
magnetic field, are still not completely understood and will benefit from a
basis that explicitly connects them to the much better understood FQH systems.
  The second basis mapping, the Exact Holographic Mapping (EHM), maps any
lattice system to a holographic 'bulk' with an additional emergent dimension
representing energy scale. Devised in the spirit of the highly popular AdS-CFT
correspondence, it attempts to understand the relationship between a given
system and its equivalent dual geometry. In particular, we found excellent
theoretical agreement of certain dual geometries from EHM with those expected
from the Ryu-Takanayagi formula relating the bulk geometry with entanglement
entropy. Additionally, the EHM also proves useful in providing a link between
different topological quantities, such as relating the Chern number of the
abovementioned Chern Insulators with the Axion angle of 3D topological
insulators.

with keywords and then learn a mapping from vi- sual features to keywords.
Manually tagging images is a subjective pro- cess and the same or very similar
visual contents are often tagged with different keywords. Furthermore, not all
tags have the same descriptive power for visual contents and large vocabulary
available from natural language could result in a very diverse set of keywords.
In this paper, we propose an unsupervised visual theme discovery framework as a
better (more compact, efficient and effective) alternative to semantic
represen- tation of visual contents. We first show that tag based annotation
lacks consistency and compactness for describing visually similar contents. We
then learn the visual similarity between tags based on the visual features of
the images containing the tags. At the same time, we use a natural language
processing technique (word embedding) to measure the seman- tic similarity
between tags. Finally, we cluster tags into visual themes based on their visual
similarity and semantic similarity measures using a spectral clustering
algorithm. We conduct user studies to evaluate the effectiveness and
rationality of the visual themes discovered by our unsu- pervised algorithm and
obtains promising result. We then design three common computer vision tasks,
example based image search, keyword based image search and image labelling to
explore potential applica- tion of our visual themes discovery framework. In
experiments, visual themes significantly outperforms tags on semantic image
understand- ing and achieve state-of-art performance in all three tasks. This
again demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of proposed framework.

homopolymers and exponential distribution. As a result of the exponential
distribution of chaperones, energy dependency of the translocation time will
changed and one see a minimum in translocation time versus effective energy
curve. The same trend can be seen in scaling exponent of time versus polymer
length, $\beta$ ($T\sim\beta$). Interestingly in some special cases e.g.
chaperones of size $\lambda=6$ and with exponential distribution rate of
$\alpha=5$, the minimum reaches even to amount of less than $1$ ($\beta<1$). We
explain the possibility of this rare result and base on a theoretical
discussion we show that by taking into account the velocity dependency of the
translocation on polymer length, one could truly predict the amount of this

magnetic resonances arise from hybrid Mie-Fabry-P\'{e}rot modes, and can
constructively interfere with induced electric dipole moments, thereby leading
to novel multi-frequency unidirectional scattering. Here we focus on elongated
dielectric nanobars, whose magnetic resonances can be spectrally tuned by their
aspect ratios. Based on our theoretical results, we suggest all-dielectric
multimode metasurfaces and verify them in proof-of-principle microwave
experiments. We also believe that the demonstrated property of multimode
directionality is largely responsible for the best efficiency of all-dielectric
metasurfaces that were recently shown to operate across multiple telecom bands.

is $H$-intersecting if the intersection of any two graphs in $F$ contains a

  In [D. Ellis, Y. Filmus, and E. Friedgut, Triangle-intersecting families of

Furthermore, they proved a $p$-biased generalization, stating that for any $p

that the random graph $G(n,p)$ belongs to $F$.

$\mu_{p}(F)\le p^{t(t+1)/2}$ for all $p \leq (2t-1)/(2t)$.

the design of Massive MIMO wireless systems, due to the length of the training
sequences required to distinguish the antennas (in the downlink) and the users
(for the uplink where a given spectral resource can be shared by a large number
of users). In this article, we focus on the downlink CSI estimation case.
Considering the presence of spatial correlation at the base transceiver station
(BTS) side, and assuming that the per-user channel statistics are known, we
seek to exploit this correlation to minimize the length of the pilot sequences.
We introduce a scheme relying on non-orthogonal pilot sequences and feedback
from the user terminal (UT), which enables the BTS to estimate all downlink
channels. Thanks to the relaxed orthogonality assumption on the pilots, the
length of the obtained pilot sequences can be strictly lower than the number of
antennas at the BTS, while the CSI estimation error is kept arbitrarily small.
We introduce two algorithms to dynamically design the required pilot sequences,
analyze and validate the performance of the proposed CSI estimation method
through numerical simulations using a realistic scenario based on the one-ring

account for the observed distribution of lower kHz QPO frequencies in the case
of individual sources as well as the ensemble of sources. The model function
depends on the basic length scales such as the magnetospheric radius and the
radial width of the boundary region, both of which are expected to vary with
$\dot{M}$ to determine the QPO frequencies. In addition to modifying the length
scales and hence the QPO frequencies, the variation in $\dot{M}$, being
sufficiently large, may also lead to distinct accretion regimes, which would be
characterized by Z and atoll phases.

collision energy (\sqsn) and centrality of the collisions. The product of
$\nu_{(+-,dyn)}$ and $\langle N_{ch} \rangle$ shows a monotonic decrease with

their origin in the QGP phase. The fluctuations in terms of higher moments of
net-proton, net-electric charge and net-kaon have been measured for various

situations in which the players' behavior is affected by ethical
considerations. Particularly, we assume that they partially follow, Kant's
`Categorical Imperative'. The model is stated for games with a continuum of
players. The basic assumption made is that the participants perceive that they
belong to virtual (imagined) groups, in which they optimize their actions as if
they were bound to follow the same strategy. A partially cooperative
equilibrium, called $r$-Kant-Nash equilibrium is then introduced. We then study
the relationship of the $r$-Kant-Nash equilibrium with the Nash, (Bentham-)
Harsanyi, Rawls difference and Roemer solutions. For the case where the set of
possible player types is finite, we prove sufficient conditions for the
existence and uniqueness of the $r$-Kant-Nash equilibrium and the equilibrium
is characterized in terms of a variational inequality. For the case of
continuous types, necessary conditions characterizing the partial Kantian

ordered magnets. Here we confirm the recent proposal that, in a weak magnetic

all-sky X-ray monitoring with the gas propotional counters (GSC) of the Monitor

flares are found to be at the upper ends for stellar flares with the luminosity
of 10^(31-34) ergs s-1 in the 2-20 keV band, the emission measure of 10^(54-57)
cm-3, the e-folding time of 1 hour to 1.5 days, and the total radiative energy

luminosity of 5(3-9)*10^33 ergs s-1 in the 2-20 keV band was detected in one of
the flares on II Peg, which is one of the, or potentially the, largest ever
observed in stellar flares. X-ray flares were detected from GT Mus, V841 Cen,
SZ Psc, and TWA-7 for the first time in this survey. Whereas most of our
detected sources are multiple-star systems, two of them are single stars (YZ
CMi and TWA-7). Among the stellar sources within 100 pc distance, the MAXI/GSC
sources have larger rotation velocities than the other sources. This suggests
that the rapid rotation velocity may play a key role in generating large
flares. Combining the X-ray flare data of nearby stars and the sun, taken from
literature and our own data, we discovered a universal correlation of
tau~L_X^0.2 for the flare duration tau and the intrinsic X-ray luminosity L_X

proposing accounts of how symbolic computation can be implemented in neural

symbolic space, the versatile shift, showing that it supports the real-time
simulation of a range of automata. We then show that the Goedelization of
versatile shifts defines nonlinear dynamical automata, dynamical systems
evolving on a vectorial space. Finally, we present a mapping between nonlinear
dynamical automata and recurrent artificial neural networks. The mapping
defines an architecture characterized by its granular modularity, where data,
symbolic operations and their control are not only distinguishable in
activation space, but also spatially localizable in the network itself, while
maintaining a distributed encoding of symbolic representations. The resulting
networks simulate automata in real-time and are programmed directly, in absence
of network training. To discuss the unique characteristics of the architecture
and their consequences, we present two examples: i) the design of a Central
Pattern Generator from a finite-state locomotive controller, and ii) the
creation of a network simulating a system of interactive automata that supports
the parsing of garden-path sentences as investigated in psycholinguistics
experiments.

that barlenses and X-shape features are physically the same phenomenon.
However, which of the two features is observed depends, not only on galaxy
inclination, but also on its central flux concentration. The observed nearly
round face-on barlens morphology is expected when at least a few percents of
the disk mass is in a central component, within a region much smaller than the

growth starts with linear chains and, at n = 10, ring structures begins to
dominate. The rings continue to grow and, at some point n > 30, they transform
into close-cage fullerenes and the growth is shown to progress by the fullerene

potentials for Wi-Fi networks, which carry a significant amount of global

model for venue owners (VOs) deploying public Wi-Fi hotspots, where the VOs can
generate revenue by providing two different Wi-Fi access schemes for mobile
users (MUs): (i) the premium access, in which MUs directly pay VOs for their
Wi-Fi usage, and (ii) the advertising sponsored access, in which MUs watch
advertisements in exchange of the free usage of Wi-Fi. VOs sell their ad spaces
to advertisers (ADs) via an ad platform, and share the ADs' payments with the
ad platform. We formulate the economic interactions among the ad platform, VOs,
MUs, and ADs as a three-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the ad platform
announces its advertising revenue sharing policy. In Stage II, VOs determine
the Wi-Fi prices (for MUs) and advertising prices (for ADs). In Stage III, MUs
make access choices and ADs purchase advertising spaces. We analyze the
sub-game perfect equilibrium (SPE) of the proposed game systematically, and our
analysis shows the following useful observations. First, the ad platform's
advertising revenue sharing policy in Stage I will affect only the VOs' Wi-Fi
prices but not the VOs' advertising prices in Stage II. Second, both the VOs'
Wi-Fi prices and advertising prices are non-decreasing in the advertising
concentration level and non-increasing in the MU visiting frequency. Numerical
results further show that the VOs are capable of generating large revenues
through mainly providing one type of Wi-Fi access (the premium access or
advertising sponsored access), depending on their advertising concentration
levels and MU visiting frequencies.

simultaneously with only one readout cable pair and a single cryogenic
amplifier. We evaluate, in a representative environment, the system performance
in terms of sensitivity, dynamic range, optical efficiency, cosmic ray
rejection, pixel-pixel crosstalk and overall yield at at an observation centre
frequency of 850 GHz and 20% fractional bandwidth. The overall system has an
excellent sensitivity, with an average detector sensitivity NEPdet=3x10^-19
W/rt(Hz) measured using a thermal calibration source. At a loading power per
pixel of 50fW we demonstrate white, photon noise limited detector noise down to
300 mHz. The dynamic range would allow the detection of 1 Jy bright sources
within the field of view without tuning the readout of the detectors. The
expected dead time due to cosmic ray interactions, when operated in an L2 or a
similar far-Earth orbit, is found to be <4%. Additionally, the achieved pixel
yield is 83% and the crosstalk between the pixels is <-30dB. This demonstrates
that MKID technology can provide multiplexing ratios on the order of a 1000

objectives are considered. The first one is to understand the role of
nonlinearities in situations where they are very large, as at the
$\alpha$--$\beta$ structural phase transition. We show that on the one hand
they don't play an essential role in connection with the form of the spectra in
the infrared. On the other hand they play an essential role in introducing a
chaoticity which involves a definite normal mode. This might explain why that
mode is Raman active in the $\alpha$ phase, but not in the $\beta$ phase. The
second objective concerns whether it is possible in a microscopic model to
obtain normal mode frequencies, or peak frequencies in the optical spectra,
that are in good agreement with the experimental data for quartz.
Notwithstanding a lot of effort, we were unable to find results agreeing better
than about 6%, as apparently also occurs in the whole available literature. We
interpret this fact as indicating that some essential qualitative feature is

  Tassiulas","Auction-Based Coopetition between LTE Unlicensed and Wi-Fi","32 pages",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by the recent efforts in extending LTE to the unlicensed spectrum,
we propose a novel spectrum sharing framework for the coopetition (i.e.,
cooperation and competition) between LTE and Wi-Fi in the unlicensed band.
Basically, the LTE network can choose to work in one of the two modes: in the
competition mode, it randomly accesses an unlicensed channel, and interferes
with the Wi-Fi access point using the same channel; in the cooperation mode, it
delivers traffic for the Wi-Fi users in exchange for the exclusive access of
the corresponding channel. Because the LTE network works in an
interference-free manner in the cooperation mode, it can achieve a much larger
data rate than that in the competition mode, which allows it to effectively
serve both its own users and the Wi-Fi users. We design a second-price reverse
auction mechanism, which enables the LTE provider and the Wi-Fi access point
owners (APOs) to effectively negotiate the operation mode. Specifically, the
LTE provider is the auctioneer (buyer), and the APOs are the bidders (sellers)
who compete to sell their channel access opportunities to the LTE provider. In
Stage I of the auction, the LTE provider announces a reserve rate. In Stage II
of the auction, the APOs submit their bids. We show that the auction involves
allocative externalities, i.e., the cooperation between the LTE provider and
one APO benefits other APOs who are not directly involved in this cooperation.
As a result, a particular APO's willingness to cooperate is affected by its
belief about other APOs' willingness to cooperate. This makes our analysis much
more challenging than that of the conventional second-price auction, where
bidding truthfully is a weakly dominant strategy. We show that the APOs have a
unique form of the equilibrium bidding strategies in Stage II, based on which
we analyze the LTE provider's optimal reserve rate in Stage I.

crowding problem when the data include highly imbalanced similarities. This
implies that the data points with higher total similarity tend to get crowded
around the display center. To solve this problem, we introduce a fast
normalization method and normalize the similarity matrix to be doubly
stochastic such that all the data points have equal total similarities.
Furthermore, we show empirically and theoretically that the doubly
stochasticity constraint often leads to embeddings which are approximately
spherical. This suggests replacing a flat space with spheres as the embedding
space. The spherical embedding eliminates the discrepancy between the center
and the periphery in visualization, which efficiently resolves the crowding
problem. We compared the proposed method (DOSNES) with the state-of-the-art SNE
method on three real-world datasets and the results clearly indicate that our

user's face. However, in most of the service robot applications, the user needs
to move himself/herself to allow the robot to see him/her face to face. To
overcome such limitations, a method for estimating human body orientation is
required. Previous studies used various components such as feature extractors
and classification models to classify the orientation which resulted in low
performance. For a more robust and accurate approach, we propose the light
weight convolutional neural networks, an end to end system, for estimating
human body orientation. Our body orientation estimation model achieved 81.58%
and 94% accuracy with the benchmark dataset and our own dataset respectively.
The proposed method can be used in a wide range of service robot applications
which depend on the ability to estimate human body orientation. To show its
usefulness in service robot applications, we designed a simple robot
application which allows the robot to move towards the user's frontal plane.
With this, we demonstrated an improved face detection rate.

disposable `species'. The combination of the race to optimal performance and
disposability has resulted in considerable footprint and impact. Although
approaches such as increasing efficiency, reducing the total cost of ownership,
life cycle assessment and management, and circular economy have been put
forward to manage and reduce the footprint and impact, the complexity of
processes involved and especially invisibility of key but unobservable
processes has resulted in some lower bounds for minimal achievable footprint.
In this work, a modified approach to the Genetic Algorithm is proposed in order
to introduce the notion of 'nondisposability' to the ICT products and services
in order to implicitly influence and manage unobservable processes, and
ultimately reduce the overall footprint and resource consumption. The proposed
genetic algorithm is called FairGA, and it is compared with the traditional
Genetic Algorithm against standard optimization functions. Also, the impact of
the FairGA on the resource extraction has been illustrated with promising

Only a few radio galaxies have been detected by Fermi/LAT. Recently, the
GHz-peaked spectrum source PKS 1718-649 was confirmed to be gamma-ray bright,
providing further evidence for the existence of a population of gamma-ray loud,
compact radio galaxies. A spectral turnover in the radio spectrum in the MHz to
GHz range is a characteristic feature of these objects, which are thought to be
young due to their small linear sizes. The multiwavelength properties of the
gamma-ray source PMN J1603-4904 suggest that it is a member of this source
class. Aims. The known radio spectrum of PMN J1603-4904 can be described by a
power law above 1 GHz. Using observations from the Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope (GMRT) at 150, 325, and 610 MHz, we investigate the behaviour of the
spectrum at lower frequencies to search for a low-frequency turnover. Methods.
Data from the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS ADR) catalogue and archival GMRT
observations were used to construct the first MHz to GHz spectrum of PMN
J1603-4904. Results. We detect a low-frequency turnover of the spectrum and
measure the peak position at about 490 MHz (rest-frame), which, using the known
relation of peak frequency and linear size, translates into a maximum linear
source size of ~1.4 kpc. Conclusions. The detection of the MHz peak indicates
that PMN J1603-4904 is part of this population of radio galaxies with turnover
frequencies in the MHz to GHz regime. Therefore it can be considered the
second, confirmed object of this kind detected in gamma-rays. Establishing this
gamma-ray source class will help to investigate the gamma-ray production sites
and to test broadband emission models.

private capacities of quantum channels. We begin by defining various
energy-constrained communication tasks, including quantum communication with a
uniform energy constraint, entanglement transmission with an average energy
constraint, private communication with a uniform energy constraint, and secret
key transmission with an average energy constraint. We develop several code
conversions, which allow us to conclude non-trivial relations between the
capacities corresponding to the above tasks. We then show how the regularized,
energy-constrained coherent information is equal to the capacity for the first
two tasks and is an achievable rate for the latter two tasks, whenever the
energy observable satisfies the Gibbs condition of having a well defined
thermal state for all temperatures and the channel satisfies a finite
output-entropy condition. For degradable channels satisfying these conditions,
we find that the single-letter energy-constrained coherent information is equal
to all of the capacities. We finally apply our results to degradable quantum
Gaussian channels and recover several results already established in the
literature (in some cases, we prove new results in this domain). Contrary to
what may appear from some statements made in the literature recently, proofs of
these results do not require the solution of any kind of minimum output entropy
conjecture or entropy photon-number inequality.

problems ER causes as we move towards the Semantic Web. Subsequently, while
maintaining the semantics of the aforementioned standards but rejecting the ER
as a conceptual framework for bibliographic data, this paper builds on the RDF
(Resource Description Framework) potential and documents how both the RDF and
Linked Data's rationale can affect the way we model bibliographic data. In this
way, a new approach to bibliographic data emerges where the distinction between
description and authorities is obsolete. Instead, the integration of the
authorities with descriptive information becomes fundamental so that a network
of correlations can be established between the entities and the names by which
the entities are known. Naming is a vital issue for human cultures because
names are not random sequences of characters or sounds that stand just as
identifiers for the entities; they also have socio-cultural meanings and
interpretations. Thus, instead of describing indivisible resources, we could
describe entities that appear in a variety of names on various resources. In
this study, a method is proposed to connect the names with the entities they
represent and, in this way, to document the provenance of these names by
connecting specific resources with specific names.

to a large dust cavity, that is often corroborated by spatially resolved
observations at ~ mm wavelengths. We present the first spatially resolved ~
mm-wavelength images of the disk around the Herbig Ae/Be star, HD 97048.
Scattered light images show that the disk extends to ~640 au. The ALMA data
reveal a circular-symmetric dusty disk extending to ~350 au, and a molecular
disk traced in CO J=3-2 emission, extending to ~750 au. The CO emission arises
from a flared layer with an opening angle ~ 30 deg - 40 deg. HD 97048 is
another source for which the large (~ mm-sized) dust grains are more centrally
concentrated than the small (~ {\mu}m-sized) grains and molecular gas, likely
due to radial drift. The images and visibility data modelling suggests a
decrement in continuum emission within ~50 au, consistent with the cavity size
determined from mid-infrared imaging (34 +/- 4 au). The extracted continuum
intensity profiles show ring-like structures with peaks at ~50, 150, and 300
au, with associated gaps at ~100 and 250 au. This structure should be confirmed
in higher-resolution images (FWHM ~ 10 - 20 au). These data confirm the
classification of HD 97048 as a transitional disk that also possesses multiple
ring-like structures in the dust continuum emission. Additional data are
required at multiple and well-separated frequencies to fully characterise the
disk structure, and thereby constrain the mechanism(s) responsible for
sculpting the HD 97048 disk.

magnetic Gr\""uneisen parameter $\Gamma_{\rm H}$, which equals the adiabatic

divergence, sign change and $T/(H-H_c)^\epsilon$ scaling. We categorize
thirteen materials, ranging from heavy fermion metals to frustrated magnets,
where such experimental signatures have been found. Remarkably, seven
stoichiometric materials at ambient pressure show $H_c=0$. However, additional
thermodynamic and magnetic experiments suggest that most of them do not show a
zero-field QCP. While the existence of a pressure insensitive ""strange metal""
state is one possibility, for some of the materials $\Gamma_{\rm H}$ seems
influenced by impurities or a fraction of moments which are not participating
in a frozen state. To unambiguously prove zero-field and pressure sensitive
quantum criticality, a $\Gamma_{\rm H}$ divergence is insufficient and also the
Gr\""uneisen ratio of thermal expansion to specific heat must diverge.

processing and storing of radio observations with high time and frequency
resolutions and large bandwidths. Lossy compression of interferometric
radio-astronomical data is considered to reduce the volume of visibility data
and to speed up processing.
  A new compression technique named ""Dysco"" is introduced that consists of two
steps: a normalization step, in which grouped visibilities are normalized to
have a similar distribution; and a quantization and encoding step, which rounds
values to a given quantization scheme using a dithering scheme. Several
non-linear quantization schemes are tested and combined with different methods
for normalizing the data. Four data sets with observations from the LOFAR and
MWA telescopes are processed with different processing strategies and different
combinations of normalization and quantization. The effects of compression are
measured in image plane.
  The noise added by the lossy compression technique acts like normal system
noise. The accuracy of Dysco is depending on the signal-to-noise ratio of the
data: noisy data can be compressed with a smaller loss of image quality. Data
with typical correlator time and frequency resolutions can be compressed by a
factor of 6.4 for LOFAR and 5.3 for MWA observations with less than 1% added
system noise. An implementation of the compression technique is released that
provides a Casacore storage manager and allows transparent encoding and
decoding. Encoding and decoding is faster than the read/write speed of typical
disks.
  The technique can be used for LOFAR and MWA to reduce the archival space
requirements for storing observed data. Data from SKA-low will likely be
compressible by the same amount as LOFAR. The same technique can be used to
compress data from other telescopes, but a different bit-rate might be
required.

de Bure Interferometer (PdBI). We perform an LTE and RADEX analysis to
determine the column densities and physical characteristics of the gas emitting
these two lines. We then use a chemical model to determine the origin of the
emission. There is a strong SiO peak to the East of the AGN, with weak
detections to the West. This distribution contrasts that of HNCO, which is
detected more strongly to the West. The SiO emission peak in the East is
similar to the peak of the molecular gas mass traced by CO. HNCO emission is
offset from this peak by as much as 80 pc ( 1""). We compare velocity integrated
line ratios in the East and West. We confirm that SiO emission strongly
dominates in the East, while the reverse is true in the West. We use RADEX to
analyse the possible gas conditions that could produce such emission. We find
that, in both East and West, we cannot constrain a single temperature for the
gas. We run a grid of chemical models of potential shock processes in the CND
and find that SiO is significantly enhanced during a fast (60 km/s) shock but
not during a slow (20 km/s) shock, nor in a gas not subjected to shocks at all.
We find the inverse for HNCO, whose abundance increases during slow shocks and
in warm non-shocked gas. High SiO and low HNCO indicated a fast shock, while
high HNCO and low SiO indicates either a slow shock or warm, dense, non-shocked
gas. The East Knot is therefore likely to contain gas that is heavily shocked.
From chemical modelling, gas in the West Knot may be non-shocked, or maybe
undergoing a much milder shock event. When taking into account RADEX results,
the milder shock event is the more likely of the two scenarios.

generalize the covariance estimator of the fidelity susceptibility, an unbiased
diagnostic for phase transitions, to the case of retarded interactions. The new
estimators are applied to half-filled spinless and spinful Holstein models in

The main difficulty which has to be overcome is that the nonlinear regime for
such flows is outside of applicability of standard perturbation theory, even
for short times. The solutions we consider are archetypal examples of viscous
vortex rings, and can be thought of as axisymmetric analogues of the
self-similar Lamb-Oseen vortices in two-dimensional flows. Our method provides
the leading term in a fixed-viscosity short-time asymptotic expansion of the

expansions that can be found in the literature [7].

  Dehazing",,,,,"cs.DC cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditional dehazing techniques, as a well studied topic in image processing,
are now widely used to eliminate the haze effects from individual images.
However, even the state-of-the-art dehazing algorithms may not provide
sufficient support to video analytics, as a crucial pre-processing step for
video-based decision making systems (e.g., robot navigation), due to the
limitations of these algorithms on poor result coherence and low processing
efficiency. This paper presents a new framework, particularly designed for
video dehazing, to output coherent results in real time, with two novel
techniques. Firstly, we decompose the dehazing algorithms into three generic
components, namely transmission map estimator, atmospheric light estimator and
haze-free image generator. They can be simultaneously processed by multiple
threads in the distributed system, such that the processing efficiency is
optimized by automatic CPU resource allocation based on the workloads.
Secondly, a cross-frame normalization scheme is proposed to enhance the
coherence among consecutive frames, by sharing the parameters of atmospheric
light from consecutive frames in the distributed computation platform. The
combination of these techniques enables our framework to generate highly
consistent and accurate dehazing results in real-time, by using only 3 PCs
connected by Ethernet.

modeling, have long been plagued by the lack of expressive power. This issue is
primarily due to the fact that conventional MRFs formulations tend to use
simplistic factors to capture local patterns. In this paper, we move beyond
such limitations, and propose a novel MRF model that uses fully-connected
neurons to express the complex interactions among pixels. Through theoretical
analysis, we reveal an inherent connection between this model and recurrent
neural networks, and thereon derive an approximated feed-forward network that
couples multiple RNNs along opposite directions. This formulation combines the
expressive power of deep neural networks and the cyclic dependency structure of
MRF in a unified model, bringing the modeling capability to a new level. The
feed-forward approximation also allows it to be efficiently learned from data.

tone and spontaneous recovery; it is a common condition, albeit one that is
challenging to accurately diagnose. Uncertainties about the triggering
mechanisms and their underlying pathophysiology have led to various
classifications of patients exhibiting this symptom. This study presents a new
way to classify syncope types using machine learning. Method: we hypothesize
that syncope types can be characterized by analyzing blood pressure and heart
rate time series data obtained from the head-up tilt test procedure. By
optimizing classification rates, we identify a small number of determining
markers which enable data clustering. Results: We apply the proposed method to
clinical data from 157 subjects; each subject was identified by an expert as
being either healthy or suffering from one of three conditions:
cardioinhibitory syncope, vasodepressor syncope and postural orthostatic
tachycardia. Clustering confirms the three disease groups and identifies two
distinct subgroups within the healthy controls. Conclusion: The proposed method
provides evidence to question current syncope classifications; it also offers
means to refine them. Significance: Current syncope classifications are not
based on pathophysiology and have not led to significant improvements in
patient care. It is expected that a more faithful classification will
facilitate our understanding of the autonomic system for healthy subjects,
which is essential in analyzing pathophysiology of the disease groups.

best-arm identification task, we introduce a version of Successive Elimination
based on random shuffling of the $K$ arms. We prove that under a novel and mild
assumption on the mean gap $\Delta$, this simple but powerful modification
achieves the same guarantees in term of sample complexity and cumulative regret
than its original version, but in a much wider class of problems, as it is not
anymore constrained to stationary distributions. We also show that the original
{\sc Successive Elimination} fails to have controlled regret in this more
general scenario, thus showing the benefit of shuffling. We then remove our
mild assumption and adapt the algorithm to the best-arm identification task
with switching arms. We adapt the definition of the sample complexity for that
case and prove that, against an optimal policy with $N-1$ switches of the
optimal arm, this new algorithm achieves an expected sample complexity of
$O(\Delta^{-2}\sqrt{NK\delta^{-1} \log(K \delta^{-1})})$, where $\delta$ is the

short- and long-term plasticity. Furthermore, our neuromorphic phototransistor
can take multiple pre-synaptic light stimuli via wavelength-division
multiplexing and allows advanced optical processing through
charge-trap-mediated optical coupling. The capability of complex neuromorphic
functionalities in a simple silicon-compatible device paves the way for novel
neuromorphic computing architectures involving photonics.

wave through a semi-infinite array of point scatterers/resonators, which take a
variety of physically interesting forms. The mathematical model accounts for
several classes of point defects, including mass-spring resonators attached to
the top surface of the flexural plate and their limiting case of concentrated
point masses. We also analyse the special case of resonators attached to
opposite faces of the plate. The problem is reduced to a functional equation of
the Wiener-Hopf type, whose kernel varies with the type of scatterer
considered. A novel approach, which stems from the direct connection between
the kernel function of the semi-infinite system and the quasi-periodic Green's
functions for corresponding infinite systems, is used to identify special
frequency regimes. We thereby demonstrate dynamically anisotropic wave effects
in semi-infinite platonic crystals, with particular attention paid to designing
systems to exhibit dynamic neutrality (perfect transmission) and localisation
close to the structured interface.

response of the modulated fiber optical backscattered signal in a steady state

reconstruction of the fiber transfer function, which, associated to its
mathematical model, is capable of extracting the fiber characteristics. The
technique is capable of identifying non-reflective fault events in an optical
fiber link and is perfectly compatible with previous methods that focus on the
reflective events. The fact that the recuperation of the complex signal is
performed in the frequency domain and not via a Fourier Transform enables the
measurements to overcome the spatial resolution limitation of Fourier Transform
incoherent-OFDR measurements even with frequency sweep ranges down to
100-100000 Hz. This result is backed up by a less than 10 meters difference in
fault location when compared to standard OTDR measurements.

with hard antineutrino spectrum based on neutron activation of 7Li and
subsequent fast beta-decay (T 1/2 = 0.84 s) of the 8Li isotope with emission of
antineutrino with energy up to 13 MeV - is discussed. Creation of the intensive
isotope neutrino source of hard spectrum will allow to increase the detection
statistics of neutrino interaction and it is especially urgent for oscillation
experiments. The scheme of the proposed neutrino source is based on the
continuous transport of the created 8Li to the neutrino detector, which moved
away from the place of neutron activation. Analytical expressions for lithium
antineutrino flux is obtained. The discussed source will ensure to increase the
cross section for reactions with deuteron from several times to tens compare to
the reactor antineutrino spectrum. An another unique feature of the
installation is the possibility to vary smoothly the hardness of the
antineutrino spectrum.

nonvolatile devices. In addition to multi-level nonvolatile memory, we
demonstrate here that nonvolatile logic gates such as NOR and NAND can be
implemented in a single memtranstor made of the Ni/PMN-PT/Ni heterostructure.
After applying two sequent voltage pulses (X1, X2) as the logic inputs on the
memtranstor, the output magnetoelectric voltage can be positive high (logic
""1""), positive low (logic ""0""), or negative (logic ""0""), depending on the
levels of X1 and X2. The underlying physical mechanism is related to the
complete or partial reversal of ferroelectric polarization controlled by
inputting selective voltage pulses, which determines the magnitude and sign of
the magnetoelectric voltage coefficient. The combined functions of both memory
and logic could enable the memtranstor as a promising candidate for future
computing systems beyond von Neumann architecture.

disciplines. It has not only drawn numerous surprising connections between
physical systems under the guise of holographic duality, but has also inspired
the development of wavelet theory now widely used in signal processing.
Synergizing on these two developments, we describe in this paper a generalized
exact holographic mapping that maps a generic N-dimensional lattice system to a
N+1-dimensional holographic dual, with the emergent dimension representing
scale. In previous works, this was achieved via the iterations of the simplest
of all unitary mappings, the Haar mapping, which fails to preserve the form of
most Hamiltonians. By taking advantage of the full generality of biorthogonal
wavelets, our new generalized holographic mapping framework is able to preserve
the form of a large class of lattice Hamiltonians. By explicitly separating
features that are fundamentally associated with the physical system from those
that are basis-specific, we also obtain a clearer understanding of how the
resultant bulk geometry arises. For instance, the number of nonvanishing
moments of the high pass wavelet filter is revealed to be proportional to the
radius of the dual Anti deSitter (AdS) space geometry. We conclude by proposing
modifications to the mapping for systems with generic Fermi pockets.

  Vol. 24, Kouchi, Japan Nov 2001",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the objectives of the pedestrian analysis is to evaluate the effects
of proposed policy on the pedestrian facilities before its implementation. The
implementation of a policy without pedestrian analysis might lead to a very
costly trial and error due to the implementation cost (i.e. user cost,
construction time and cost, etc.). On the other hand, using good analysis
tools, the trial and error of policy could be done in the analysis level. Once
the analysis could prove a good performance, the implementation of the policy
is straightforward. The problem is how to evaluate the impact of the policy
quantitatively toward the behavior of pedestrians before its implementation.
Since the interaction of pedestrians cannot be well address using a macroscopic
level of analysis, a microscopic level of analysis is the choice. However, the
analytical solution of the microscopic pedestrian model is very difficult and
simulation models are more practical approach. To evaluate the impact of the
policy quantitatively toward the behavior of pedestrians before its
implementation, a microscopic pedestrian simulation model was developed. The
model was based on physical forces, which work upon each pedestrian
dynamically. To demonstrate the numerical analysis of the model, an
experimental policy on pedestrian crossing was performed. The simulation
results showed that the keep right policy or the lane-like segregation policy
is inclined to be superior to do minimum or mix-lane policy in terms of average
speed, average delay and dissipation time.
