their noisy surround- ing they often produce mechanical work (e.g. micro-heat
engines) or display rectified Brownian motion (e.g. molecular motors). This
invokes the research in terms of experimentally quantifiable thermodynamic
efficiencies. To enhance the efficiency of such devices, close-loop control is
an useful technique. Here a single Brownian particle is driven by a harmonic
confinement with time-periodic contraction and expansion, together with a
velocity feedback that acts on the particle only when the trap contracts. Due
to this feedback we are able to extract thermodynamic work out of the system
having single heat bath without violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics. We
analyse the system using stochastic thermodynamics.

transition relation induces a partial order on states, that is, for which
cycles occur only in the form of self-loops on a single state. A poNFA is
universal if it accepts all words over its input alphabet. Deciding
universality is PSPACE-complete for poNFAs, and we show that this remains true
even when restricting to a fixed alphabet. This is nontrivial since standard
encodings of alphabet symbols in, e.g., binary can turn self-loops into longer
cycles. A lower coNP-complete complexity bound can be obtained if we require
that all self-loops in the poNFA are deterministic, in the sense that the
symbol read in the loop cannot occur in any other transition from that state.
We find that such restricted poNFAs (rpoNFAs) characterise the class of
$\mathcal{R}$-trivial languages, and we establish the complexity of deciding if
the language of an NFA is $\mathcal{R}$-trivial. Nevertheless, the limitation
to fixed alphabets turns out to be essential even in the restricted case:
deciding universality of rpoNFAs with unbounded alphabets is PSPACE-complete.
Based on a close relation between universality and the problems of inclusion
and equivalence, we also obtain the complexity results for these two problems.
Finaly, we show that the languages of rpoNFAs are definable by deterministic
(one-unambiguous) regular expressions, which makes them interesting in schema
languages for XML data.

the hydration structures, first hydrolysis reaction and diffusion of aqueous

that the first hydration shell of both V$^{2+}$ and V$^{3+}$ contains six water

ligands. The first acidity constants (p$K_\mathrm{a}$) estimated using
metadynamics simulations are 2.47, 3.06 and 5.38 for aqueous V$^{3+}$, VO$_2^+$

that the presence of chloride ions in the first coordination sphere of the

much higher p$K_\mathrm{a}$ value of 4.8. This should result in a lower
propensity of aqueous VO$_2^+$ for oxide precipitation reaction in agreement
with experimental observations for chloride-based electrolyte solutions. The
computed diffusion coefficients of vanadium species in water at room

their opinions interactively over single issue. Yet generally consensus can not
be achieved over single issue when agents are not completely open to
interpersonal influence. In this paper, opinion consensus in social networks
with stubborn agents is considered over issue sequences. The social network
with stubborn agents is described by the Friedkin-Johnsen (F-J) model where
agents are stubborn to their initial opinions. Firstly, we propose some
sufficient and necessary conditions both in terms of network topology and
system matrix for convergence of the F-J model over single issue. Secondly,
opinion consensus of the F-J model is investigated over issue sequences. Our
analysis establishes connections between the interpersonal influence network
and the network describing the relationship of agents' initial opinions for
successive issues. Taking advantage of these connections, we derive the
sufficient and necessary condition for the F-J model to achieve opinion
consensus over issue sequences. Finally, we consider a more general scenario
where each agent has bounded confidence in forming its initial opinion for
every issue. By analyzing the evolution of agents' ultimate opinions for each
issue over issue sequences, we prove that the connectivity of the
state-dependent network is preserved in this setting. Then the conditions for
agents to achieve opinion consensus over issue sequences are proposed.
Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our
theoretical results.

interacting with molecular clouds (MCs) can be sources of both GeV and TeV
emission. Based on the MC association, two scenarios have been proposed to
explain the observed gamma-ray emission. In one, energetic cosmic ray (CR)
particles escape from the SNR and then illuminate nearby MCs, producing
gamma-ray emission, while the other involves direct interaction between the SNR
and MC. In the direct interaction scenario, re-acceleration of pre-existing CRs
in the ambient medium is investigated while particles injected from the thermal
pool are neglected in view of the slow shock speeds in middle aged SNRs.
However, standard diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) theory produces a steady
state particle spectrum that is too flat compared to observations, which
suggests that the high energy part of the observed spectrum has not yet reached
a steady state. We derive a time dependent DSA solution in the test particle
limit for re-acceleration of pre-existing CRs case and show that it is capable
of reproducing the observed gamma-ray emission in SNRs like IC 443 and W44, in
the context of a MC interaction model. We also provide a simple physical
picture to understand the time dependent DSA spectrum. A spatially averaged
diffusion coefficient around the SNR can be estimated through fitting the
gamma-ray spectrum. The spatially averaged diffusion coefficient in middle aged
SNRs like IC 443 and W44 is estimated to be ~ 10^25 cm^2/s at ~ 1GeV, which is

Dust particles and pebbles drift outwards by radiation pressure and
photophoresis. The pebbles grow during outward drift until they reach a

growing larger they reverse their motion and drift inwards. Eventually, their
speed is fast enough that they get destroyed in collisions with other pebbles

leakers and three galaxies from the litterature), and compare their strengths
and shapes to the theoretical criteria and comparison samples of local
galaxies: the Lyman Alpha Reference Survey, Lyman Break Analogs, Green Peas,
and the high-redshift strong LyC leaker Ion2. Our LCEs are found to be strong
Lya emitters, with high equivalent widths, EW(Lya)> 70 {\AA}, and large Lya
escape fractions, fesc(Lya) > 20%. The Lya profiles are all double-peaked with
a small peak separation, in agreement with our theoretical expectations. They
also have no underlying absorption at the Lya position. All these
characteristics are very different from the Lya properties of typical
star-forming galaxies of the local Universe. A subset of the comparison samples
(2-3 Green Pea galaxies) share these extreme values, indicating that they could
also be leaking. We also find a strong correlation between the star formation
rate surface density and the escape fraction of ionising photons, indicating
that the compactness of star-forming regions plays a role in shaping low column
density paths in the interstellar medium of LCEs. The Lya properties of LCEs
are peculiar: Lya can be used as a reliable tracer of LyC escape from galaxies,
in complement to other indirect diagnostics proposed in the literature.

Most previous work addresses the influence maximization problem of selecting an
appropriate set of seed nodes to initiate the diffusion process so that the
largest number of nodes is reached. Since the seed selection problem is NP
hard, most solutions are sub-optimal. Furthermore, there may be settings in
which the seed nodes are predetermined. Thus, a natural question that arise is:
given a set of seed nodes, can we select a small set of nodes such that if we
improve their reaction to the diffusion process, the largest increase in
diffusion spread is achieved? We call this problem, the boost set selection
problem. In this paper, we formalize this problem, study its complexity and
propose appropriate algorithms. We also evaluate the effect of boosting in a
number of real networks and report the increase of influence spread achieved
for different seed sets, time limits in the diffusion process and other
diffusion parameters.

We, therefore, propose a method called ""Transfer String Kernel"" (TSK) that
achieves improved prediction of transcription factor binding site (TFBS) using
knowledge transfer via cross-context sample adaptation. TSK maps sequence
segments to a high-dimensional feature space using a discriminative mismatch
string kernel framework. In this high-dimensional space, labeled examples of
the source context are re-weighted so that the revised sample distribution
matches the target context more closely. We have experimentally verified TSK
for TFBS identifications on fourteen different TFs under a cross-organism
setting. We find that TSK consistently outperforms the state-of the-art TFBS
tools, especially when working with TFs whose binding sequences are not
conserved across contexts. We also demonstrate the generalizability of TSK by
showing its cutting-edge performance on a different set of cross-context tasks

N-electron valence perturbation theory (NEVPT2), with expected accuracies
similar to MRCI+Q and (at least) CASPT2, respectively. Great efficiency gains
are realized by representing the first-order wave function with a combination
of internal contraction (IC) and matrix product state perturbation theory
(MPSPT). With this combination, only third order reduced density matrices
(RDMs) are required. Thus, we obviate the need for calculating (or estimating)
RDMs of fourth or higher order; these had so far posed a severe bottleneck for
dynamic correlation treatments involving the large active spaces accessible to
DMRG. Using several benchmark systems, including first and second row
containing small molecules, Cr$_2$, pentacene and oxo-Mn(Salen), we shown that
active spaces containing at least 30 orbitals can be treated using this method.
On a single node, MRLCC2 and NEVPT2 calculations can be performed with over 550
and 1100 virtual orbitals, respectively. We also critically examine the errors
incurred due to the three sources of errors introduced in the present
implementation - calculating second order instead of third order energy
corrections, use of internal contraction and approximations made in the

in fact required to protect the Wi-Fi incumbent from the new LTE entrant. To
this end, we present a comprehensive coexistence study of Wi-Fi and
LTE-in-unlicensed, surveying a large parameter space of coexistence mechanisms
and a range of representative network densities and deployment scenarios. Our
results show that, typically, harmonious coexistence between Wi-Fi and LTE is
ensured by the large number of 5 GHz channels. For the worst-case scenario of
forced co-channel operation, LTE is sometimes a better neighbour to Wi-Fi -
when effective node density is low - but sometimes worse - when density is

highly dominated by dark matter (DM). Therefore, they are prime targets to
search for signals from dark matter annihilation using gamma-ray observations.
While the typical assumption is that the dark matter density profile of these
satellite galaxies can be described by a spherical symmetric
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, recent observational data of stellar
kinematics suggest that the DM halos around these galaxies are better described
by axisymmetric profiles. Motivated by such evidence, we analyse about seven
years of PASS8 Fermi data for seven classical dwarf galaxies, including Draco,
adopting both the widely used NFW profile and observationally-motivated
axisymmetric density profiles. For four of the selected dwarfs (Sextans,
Carina, Sculptor and Fornax) axisymmetric mass models suggest a cored density
profile rather than the commonly adopted cusped profile. We found that upper
limits on the annihilation cross section for some of these dwarfs are
significantly higher than the ones achieved using an NFW profile. Therefore,
upper limits in the literature obtained using spherical symmetric cusped
profiles, such as the NFW, might be overestimated. Our results show that it is
extremely important to use observationally motivated density profiles going
beyond the usually adopted NFW in order to obtain accurate constraints on the
dark matter annihilation cross section.

of topics ranging from the search for planets to the study of Milky Way
structure. The most powerful method for identifying potentially nearby stars is
proper motion (PM) surveys. All old optical surveys avoid, or are at least
substantially incomplete, near the Galactic plane. The depth and breadth of the
""Vista Variables in Via Lactea"" (VVV) near-IR survey significantly improves
this situation. Taking advantage of the VVV survey database, we have measured
PMs in the densest regions of the MW bulge and southern plane in order to
complete the census of nearby objects. We have developed a custom PM pipeline
based on VVV catalogues from the Cambridge Astronomy Survey Unit (CASU), by
comparing the first epoch of JHKs with the multi-epoch Ks-bands acquired later.
Taking advantage of the large time baseline between the 2MASS and the VVV
observations, we also obtained 2MASS-VVV PMs. We present a near-IR proper
motion catalogue for the whole area of the VVV survey, which includes 3003
moving stellar sources. All of these have been visually inspected and are real
PM objects. Our catalogue is in very good agreement with the proper motion data
supplied in IR catalogues outside the densest zone of the MW. The majority of
the PM objects in our catalogue are nearby M-dwarfs, as expected. This new
database allow us to identify 57 common proper motion binary candidates, among
which are two new systems within ~30pc of the Sun.

optical stellar clusters (SCs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We employ this

formation and its relation to the internal structure of GMCs. We reveal that
massive stars do not typically form at the highest column densities nor centers
of their parent GMCs at the ~6 pc resolution of our observations. Massive star
formation clusters over multiple generations and on size scales much smaller
than the size of the parent GMC. We find that massive star formation is
significantly boosted in clouds near SCs. Yet, whether a cloud is associated
with a SC does not depend on either the cloud's mass or global surface density.
These results reveal a connection between different generations of massive

exploit a small set of repeatedly visited locations. A concurrent literature
has emphasized the explorative nature of human behavior, showing that the
number of visited places grows steadily over time. How to reconcile these
seemingly contradicting facts remains an open question. Here, we analyze
high-resolution multi-year traces of $\sim$40,000 individuals from 4 datasets
and show that this tension vanishes when the long-term evolution of mobility
patterns is considered. We reveal that mobility patterns evolve significantly
yet smoothly, and that the number of familiar locations an individual visits at
any point is a conserved quantity with a typical size of $\sim$25 locations. We
use this finding to improve state-of-the-art modeling of human mobility.
Furthermore, shifting the attention from aggregated quantities to individual
behavior, we show that the size of an individual's set of preferred locations
correlates with the number of her social interactions. This result suggests a
connection between the conserved quantity we identify, which as we show can not
be understood purely on the basis of time constraints, and the `Dunbar number'
describing a cognitive upper limit to an individual's number of social
relations. We anticipate that our work will spark further research linking the
study of Human Mobility and the Cognitive and Behavioral Sciences.

theories, we investigate on a partially $N=2$ supersymmetric (SUSY) extension
of the standard model which has an $N=2$ SUSY sector and an $N=1$ SUSY sector.
We point out that below the scale of the partially breaking of $N=2$ to $N=1$,
the ratio of Yukawa to gauge couplings embedded in the original $N=2$ gauge
interaction in the $N=2$ sector becomes greater due to a fixed point. Since at
the partially breaking scale the sfermion masses in the $N=2$ sector is
suppressed due to the $N=2$ non-renormalization theorem, the anomaly mediation
effect becomes important. If dominant, the anomaly induced masses for the
sfermions in the $N=2$ sector are almost UV-insensitive due to the fixed point.
Interestingly, these masses are always positive, i.e. no tachyonic slepton
problem. From an example model, we show interesting phenomena differing from
the ordinary MSSM. In particular, the dark matter can be a sbino, i.e. the
scalar component of the $N=2$ vector multiplet of $\rm U(1)_Y$. To obtain the
correct dark matter abundance, the mass of sbino, as well as the MSSM
sparticles in the $N=2$ sector which have a typical mass pattern of anomaly
mediation, is required to be small. Therefore, this scenario can be tested and
confirmed in the LHC and may be further confirmed by the measurement of the
$N=2$ Yukawa couplings in future colliders. This model can explain dark matter,
muon $g-2$ anomaly, gauge coupling unification and relaxes some ordinary
problems within the MSSM. Also, it is compatible with thermal leptogenesis.

provides insight into their microscopic nature. A striking example is the
formation of bound states when quasiparticles are scattered off defects. This
is known to occur, under specific circumstances, in some metals and
superconductors but not, in general, in the charge-density-wave (CDW) state.
Here, we report the unforeseen observation of bound states when a magnetic
field quenches superconductivity and induces long-range CDW order in
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$. Bound states indeed produce an inhomogeneous pattern of the
local density of states $N(E_F)$ that leads to a skewed distribution of Knight
shifts which is detected here through an asymmetric profile of $^{17}$O NMR

in the CDW state, which provides a novel case of disorder-induced bound states
in a condensed-matter system and an insightful window into charge ordering in
the cuprates.

far exceeds the capacity of expert human analysts. In many settings, such data
is either discarded or stored unprocessed in datacenters. This paper proposes a
method of online data thinning, in which large-scale streaming datasets are
winnowed to preserve unique, anomalous, or salient elements for timely expert
analysis. At the heart of this proposed approach is an online anomaly detection
method based on dynamic, low-rank Gaussian mixture models. Specifically, the
high-dimensional covariances matrices associated with the Gaussian components
are associated with low-rank models. According to this model, most observations
lie near a union of subspaces. The low-rank modeling mitigates the curse of
dimensionality associated with anomaly detection for high-dimensional data, and
recent advances in subspace clustering and subspace tracking allow the proposed
method to adapt to dynamic environments. Furthermore, the proposed method
allows subsampling, is robust to missing data, and uses a mini-batch online
optimization approach. The resulting algorithms are scalable, efficient, and
are capable of operating in real time. Experiments on wide-area motion imagery
and e-mail databases illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

and erasures. While the two types of errors can be corrected simultaneously
with error-correcting codes, it is also known that any linear code allows for
first correcting errors and then erasures in two-step decoding. In particular,
a carefully designed parity-check matrix not only allows for separating
erasures from errors but also makes it possible to efficiently correct
erasures. The separating redundancy of a linear code is the number of
parity-check equations in a smallest parity-check matrix that has the required
property for this error-erasure separation. In a sense, it is a parameter of a
linear code that represents the minimum overhead for efficiently separating
erasures from errors. While several bounds on separating redundancy are known,
there still remains a wide gap between upper and lower bounds except for a few
limited cases. In this paper, using probabilistic combinatorics and design
theory, we improve both upper and lower bounds on separating redundancy. We
also show a relation between parity-check matrices for error-erasure separation

employing xenon-based detectors have recently come up with the most stringent
limits to date on the spin-independent elastic scattering of DM off nucleons.
For Higgs-portal scalar DM models, the new results have precluded any
possibility of accommodating low-mass DM as suggested by the DAMA and CDMS II
Si experiments utilizing other target materials, even after invoking
isospin-violating DM interactions with nucleons. In the simplest model, SM+D,
which is the standard model plus a real singlet scalar named darkon acting as
the DM candidate, the LUX and PandaX-II limits rule out DM masses roughly from
4 to 450 GeV, except a small range around the resonance point at half of the
Higgs mass where the interaction cross-section is near the neutrino-background
floor. In the THDM II+D, which is the type-II two-Higgs-doublet model combined
with a darkon, the region excluded in the SM+D by the direct searches can be
recovered due to suppression of the DM effective interactions with nucleons at
some values of the ratios of Higgs couplings to the up and down quarks, making
the interactions significantly isospin-violating. However, in either model, if
the 125-GeV Higgs boson is the portal between the dark and SM sectors, DM
masses less than 50 GeV or so are already ruled out by the LHC constraint on
the Higgs invisible decay. In the THDM II+D, if the heavier $CP$-even Higgs
boson is the portal, theoretical restrictions from perturbativity, vacuum
stability, and unitarity requirements turn out to be important instead and
exclude much of the region below 100 GeV. For larger DM masses, the THDM II+D
has plentiful parameter space that corresponds to interaction cross-sections
under the neutrino-background floor and therefore is likely to be beyond the
reach of future direct searches without directional sensitivity.

using optical and NIR Period-Wesenheit relations (PWRs), to measure the
geometry of the LMC disk and its viewing angles. Cepheid distances based on
optical PWRs are precise at 3%, but accurate to 7, while the ones based on NIR
PWRs are more accurate (to 3%), but less precise (2%-15%), given the higher
photometric error on the observed magnitudes. We found an inclination i=25.05

nodes P.A.=150.76 $\pm$ 0.02(stat.) $\pm$ 0.07(syst.) deg. These values agree
well with estimates based either on young (Red Supergiants) or on
intermediate-age (Asymptotic Giant Branch, Red Clump) stellar tracers, but they
significantly differ from evaluations based on old (RR Lyrae) stellar tracers.
This indicates that young/intermediate and old stellar populations have
different spatial distributions. Finally, by using the reddening-law fitting
approach, we provide a reddening map of the LMC disk which is ten times more
accurate and two times larger than similar maps in the literature. We also
found an LMC true distance modulus of $\mu_{0,LMC}=18.48 \pm 0.10$ (stat. and

We present initial results on the generation of solenoidal and compressive
turbulence in the intracluster medium during the formation of a small-size
cluster using highly resolved, non-radiative cosmological simulations, with a
refined monitoring in time. In this first of a series of papers, we closely
look at one simulated cluster whose formation was distinguished by a merger
around $z \sim 0.3$. We separate laminar gas motions, turbulence and shocks
with dedicated filtering strategies and distinguish the solenoidal and
compressive components of the gas flows using Hodge-Helmholtz decomposition.
Solenoidal turbulence dominates the dissipation of turbulent motions ($\sim
95\%$) in the central cluster volume at all epochs. The dissipation via
compressive modes is found to be more important ($\sim 30 \%$ of the total)
only at large radii ($\geq 0.5 ~r_{\rm vir}$) and close to merger events. We
show that enstrophy (vorticity squared) is good proxy of solenoidal turbulence.
All terms ruling the evolution of enstrophy (i.e. baroclinic, compressive,
stretching and advective terms) are found to be significant, but in amounts
that vary with time and location. Two important trends for the growth of
enstrophy in our simulation are identified: first, enstrophy is continuously
accreted into the cluster from the outside, and most of that accreted enstrophy
is generated near the outer accretion shocks by baroclinic and compressive
processes. Second, in the cluster interior vortex stretching is dominant,
although the other terms also contribute substantially.

the kinematics of relaxed molecular gas discs in seven early-type galaxies
(ETGs) selected from the ATLAS3D survey to dynamically determine mass-to-light
ratio (M/L) gradients. These M/L gradients are not very strong in the inner
parts of these objects, and galaxies that do show variations are those with the
highest specific star formation rates. Stellar population parameters derived
from star formation histories are then used in order to estimate the stellar
initial mass function function (IMF) mismatch parameter, and shed light on its
variation within ETGs. Some of our target objects require a light IMF,
otherwise their stellar population masses would be greater than their dynamical
masses. In contrast, other systems seem to require heavier IMFs to explain
their gas kinematics. Our analysis again confirms that IMF variation seems to

the EW vacuum via loop effects. The impact of such a scalar, i.e., a leptoquark

From the stability analysis various bounds are drawn on parameter space by
identifying the region corresponding to metastability and stability of the EW

theory can be considered as reasonably fine-tuned. All these constraints give a
very predictive parameter space for leptoquark couplings which can be tested at

publicly available at https://goo.gl/fpk90V}{https://goo.gl/fpk90V. It uses the
back propagation neural network along with clustering of the training set,
which makes it more efficient than existing neural network codes. In CuBAN$z$,
the training set is divided into several self learning clusters with galaxies
having similar photometric properties and spectroscopic redshifts within a
given span. The clustering algorithm uses the color information (i.e. $u-g$,
$g-r$ etc.) rather than the apparent magnitudes at various photometric bands as
the photometric redshift is more sensitive to the flux differences between
different bands rather than the actual values. Separate neural networks are
trained for each cluster using all possible colors, magnitudes and
uncertainties in the measurements. For a galaxy with unknown redshift, we
identify the closest possible clusters having similar photometric properties
and use those clusters to get the photometric redshifts using the particular
networks that were trained using those cluster members. For galaxies that do
not match with any training cluster, the photometric redshifts are obtained
from a separate network that uses entire training set. This clustering method
enables us to determine the redshifts more accurately. SDSS Stripe 82 catalog
has been used here for the demonstration of the code. For the clustered sources
with redshift range $z_{\rm spec}<0.7$, the residual error ($\langle (z_{{\rm
spec}}-z_{{\rm phot}})^2\rangle^{1/2} $) in the training/testing phase is as
low as 0.03 compared to the existing ANNz code that provides residual error on
the same test data set of 0.05. Further, we provide a much better estimate of
the uncertainty of the derived photometric redshift.

cosmic microwave background seem inconsistent with the results from direct
measurements. We show that both problems can be solved in a framework in which
dark matter consists of two distinct components, a dominant component and a
subdominant component. The primary component is cold and collisionless. The
secondary component is also cold, but interacts strongly with dark radiation,
which itself forms a tightly coupled fluid. The growth of density perturbations
in the subdominant component is inhibited by dark acoustic oscillations due to
its coupling to the dark radiation, solving the $\sigma_8$ problem, while the
presence of tightly coupled dark radiation ameliorates the $H_0$ problem. The
subdominant component of dark matter and dark radiation continue to remain in
thermal equilibrium until late times, inhibiting the formation of a dark disk.
We present an example of a simple model that naturally realizes this scenario
in which both constituents of dark matter are thermal WIMPs. Our scenario can
be tested by future stage-IV experiments designed to probe the CMB and large

field (X-rays, far-infrared and radio) to study the relative growth rates
between typical galaxies and their central supermassive black holes, from
z=2.23 to z=0. Typical star-forming galaxies at z~1-2 have black hole accretion
rates (BHARs) of 0.001-0.01 Msun/yr and star formation rates (SFRs) of ~10-40
Msun/yr, and thus grow their stellar mass much quicker than their black hole
mass (~3.3 orders of magnitude faster). However, ~3% of the sample (the sources
detected directly in the X-rays) show a significantly quicker growth of the
black hole mass (up to 1.5 orders of magnitude quicker growth than the typical
sources). BHARs fall from z=2.23 to z=0, with the decline resembling that of
star formation rate density or the typical SFR. We find that the average black
hole to galaxy growth (BHAR/SFR) is approximately constant for star-forming
galaxies in the last 11 Gyrs. The relatively constant BHAR/SFR suggests that
these two quantities evolve equivalently through cosmic time and with

we still do not understand how and when they stop forming stars and become
quiescent. We address this by applying our galaxy spectral energy distribution
models, which incorporate physically motivated star formation histories (SFHs)
from cosmological simulations, to a sample of quiescent galaxies at
$0.2<z<2.1$. A total of 845 quiescent galaxies with multi-band photometry
spanning rest-frame ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths are selected
from the CANDELS dataset. We compute median SFHs of these galaxies in bins of
stellar mass and redshift. At all redshifts and stellar masses, the median SFHs
rise, reach a peak, and then decline to reach quiescence. At high redshift, we
find that the rise and decline are fast, as expected because the Universe is
young. At low redshift, the duration of these phases depends strongly on
stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies ($\log(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})\sim9.5$) grow on
average slowly, take a long time to reach their peak of star formation
($\gtrsim 4$ Gyr), and the declining phase is fast ($\lesssim 2$ Gyr).
Conversely, high-mass galaxies ($\log(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})\sim11$) grow on
average fast ($\lesssim 2$ Gyr), and, after reaching their peak, decrease the
star formation slowly ($\gtrsim 3$ Gyr). These findings are consistent with
galaxy stellar mass being a driving factor in determining how evolved galaxies
are, with high-mass galaxies being the most evolved at any time (i.e.,
downsizing). The different durations we observe in the declining phases also
suggest that low- and high-mass galaxies experience different quenching
mechanisms that operate on different timescales.

for over one year since initial commissioning. RVS continues to work well but
the higher than expected levels of straylight reduce the limiting magnitude.
The end-of-mission radial-velocity (RV) performance requirement for G2V stars
was 15 km/s at V = 16.5 mag. Instead, 15 km/s precision is achieved at 15 < V <
16 mag, consistent with simulations that predict a loss of 1.4 mag. Simulations
also suggest that changes to Gaia's onboard software could recover ~0.14 mag of
this loss. Consequently Gaia's onboard software was upgraded in April 2015. The
status of this new commissioning period is presented, as well as the latest
scientific performance of the on-ground processing of RVS spectra. We
illustrate the implications of the RVS limiting magnitude on Gaia's view of the
Milky Way's halo in 6D using the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot (GUMS).

of observed tracers of the large scale mass density field. It seeks exact
solutions of the equations of motion (EoM), satisfying initial homogeneity and
the final observed particle (tracer) positions. The solutions are found
iteratively reaching a specified tolerance defined as the RMS of the distance
between reconstructed and observed positions. Starting from a guess for the
initial conditions, NoAM advances particles using standard N-body techniques
for solving the EoM. Alternatively, the EoM can be replaced by any
approximation such as Zel'dovich and second order perturbation theory (2LPT).
NoAM is suitable for billions of particles and can easily handle non-regular
volumes, redshift space, and other constraints. We implement NoAM to
systematically compare Zel'dovich, 2LPT, and N-body dynamics over diverse
configurations ranging from idealized high-res periodic simulation box to
realistic galaxy mocks. Our findings are (i) Non-linear reconstructions with
Zel'dovich, 2LPT, and full dynamics perform better than linear theory only for
idealized catalogs in real space. For realistic catalogs, linear theory is the
optimal choice for reconstructing velocity fields smoothed on scales > 5 Mpc/h.
(ii) all non-linear back-in-time reconstructions tested here, produce
comparable enhancement of the baryonic oscillation signal in the correlation
function.

  version",,"10.1093/mnras/stw2752",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the steadily improving sensitivity afforded by current and future galaxy
surveys, a robust extraction of two-point correlation function measurements may
become increasingly hampered by the presence of astrophysical foregrounds or
observational systematics. The concept of mode projection has been introduced
as a means to remove contaminants for which it is possible to construct a
spatial map reflecting the expected signal contribution. Owing to its
computational efficiency compared to minimum-variance methods, the sub-optimal
pseudo-Cl (PCL) power spectrum estimator is a popular tool for the analysis of
high-resolution data sets. Here, we integrate mode projection into the
framework of PCL power spectrum estimation. In contrast to results obtained
with optimal estimators, we show that the uncorrected projection of template
maps leads to biased power spectra. Based on analytical calculations, we find
exact closed-form expressions for the expectation value of the bias and
demonstrate that they can be recast in a form that allows a numerically
efficient evaluation, preserving the favorable O(l_max^3) time complexity of
PCL estimator algorithms. Using simulated data sets, we assess the scaling of
the bias with various analysis parameters and demonstrate that it can be
reliably removed. We conclude that in combination with mode projection, PCL
estimators allow for a fast and robust computation of power spectra in the
presence of systematic effects -- properties in high demand for the analysis of
ongoing and future large scale structure surveys.

prepare quantum many-body states with exceptionally low entropy in one layer,

one layer - subsystem $A$ - into a regime where excitations in $A$ develop a
single-particle gap. As a result, this operation maps directly to cooling for
subsystem $A$, with entropy being shuttled to the other layer. For both bosonic

disentangling can be realised cleanly in ongoing optical lattice experiments.
The corresponding entanglement entropies are directly measurable with quantum

nitrogen lines, we examine two cases of nitrogen abundance, one with constant
N/O ratio and the other with varying N/O ratio, with the latter motivated by
theoretical considerations of two different synthetic sources of nitrogen that
is empirically verified independently. Along a separate vector, for all line
pairs, we examine two cases of radiation field, one with the Haardt-Madau

field sourced by hot gas in the host galaxy. In all cases, two-sample

right velocity dependence to explain the low dark matter density cores seen in
small galaxies while being consistent with all constraints from observations of
clusters of galaxies. For a viable solution, the dark hydrogen mass has to be
in 10--100 GeV range and the dark fine-structure constant has to be larger than
0.02. Precisely for this range of parameters, we show that significant cooling
losses may occur due to inelastic excitations to the hyperfine state and
subsequent decays, with implications for the evolution of low-mass halos and
the early growth of supermassive black holes. Cooling from excitations to
higher $n$ levels of dark hydrogen and subsequent decays is possible at the
cluster scale, with a strong dependence on halo mass. Finally, we show that the
minimum halo mass is in the range of $10^{3.5}$ to $10^7 M_\odot$ for the
viable regions of parameter space, significantly larger than the typical
predictions for weakly-interacting dark matter models. This pattern of
observables in cosmological structure formation is unique to this model, making
it possible to rule in or rule out hidden sector hydrogen as a viable dark
matter model.

occurs only when the negative mass eigenvalue is much larger, in absolute

method, an iterative algorithm to determine eigenvalues and eigenvectors

which considers only the most recent iteration and assumes noiseless links, the
proposed techniques consider information from all the previous iterations of
the algorithm and combine them in different ways. The first technique
(Sequential Least-Squares method) sequentially constructs a least-squares

beamformer/combiner pair estimate. The second technique (Summed Power method)
aims to mitigate the effect of noise by using a linear combination of the

faster than a classical computer, it lacks the fixed-point property --- the
fraction of target items must be known precisely to know when to terminate the
algorithm. Recently, Yoder, Low, and Chuang gave an optimal gate-model search
algorithm with the fixed-point property. Meanwhile, it is known that an
adiabatic quantum algorithm, operating by continuously varying a Hamiltonian,
can reproduce the quadratic speedup of gate-model Grover search. We ask, can an
adiabatic algorithm also reproduce the fixed-point property? We show that the
answer depends on what interpolation schedule is used, so as in the gate model,
there are both fixed-point and non-fixed-point versions of adiabatic search,
only some of which attain the quadratic quantum speedup. Guided by geometric
intuition on the Bloch sphere, we rigorously justify our claims with an
explicit upper bound on the error in the adiabatic approximation. We also show
that the fixed-point adiabatic search algorithm can be simulated in the gate

the ground state is found to be the all-in-all-out (AIAO) state, whereas the
bilayer has a deformed AIAO state. For all parameters of the spin-orbit coupled
Hamiltonian we study, the lowest magnon band in the trilayer case has a nonzero
Chern number. In the bilayer case we also find a parameter range with nonzero
Chern numbers. We calculate the magnon Hall response for both geometries,
finding a striking sign change as function of temperature. Using a slave-boson
mean-field theory we study the doping of the trilayer system and discover an
unconventional time-reversal symmetry broken $d+id$ superconducting state. Our
study complements prior work in the weak coupling limit and suggests that the
$[111]$ grown thin film pyrochlore iridates are a promising candidate for
topological properties and unconventional orders.

motivated by a known physical principle and constitute a class of extended
gravity theories that have some unexplored unique aspects. In this work we
develop in detail the Newtonian and post Newtonian limits of a realisation
called Renormalization Group extended General Relativity (RGGR). Special
attention is taken to the external potential effect, which constitutes a type
of screening mechanism typical of RGGR. In the Solar System, RGGR depends on a
single dimensionless parameter $\bar \nu_\odot$, and this parameter is such
that for $\bar \nu_\odot = 0$ one fully recovers GR in the Solar System.
Previously this parameter was constrained to be $|\bar \nu_\odot| \lesssim
10^{-21}$, without considering the external potential effect. Here we show that
under a certain approximation RGGR can be cast in a form compatible with the
Parametrised Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism, and we use both the PPN formalism
and the Laplace-Runge-Lenz technique to put new bounds on $\bar \nu_\odot$,
either considering or not the external potential effect. With the external
potential effect the new bound reads $|\bar \nu_\odot| \lesssim 10^{-16}$. We
discuss the possible consequences of this bound to the dark matter abundance in
galaxies.

developers, text books, tools, and researchers disagree on which bad smells are
important. Objective: To evaluate the likelihood that a code reorganization to
address bad code smells will yield improvement in the defect-proneness of the
code. Method: We introduce XTREE, a tool that analyzes a historical log of
defects seen previously in the code and generates a set of useful code changes.
Any bad smell that requires changes outside of that set can be deprioritized
(since there is no historical evidence that the bad smell causes any problems).
Evaluation: We evaluate XTREE's recommendations for bad smell improvement
against recommendations from previous work (Shatnawi, Alves, and Borges) using
multiple data sets of code metrics and defect counts. Results: Code modules
that are changed in response to XTREE's recommendations contain significantly
fewer defects than recommendations from previous studies. Further, XTREE
endorses changes to very few code metrics, and the bad smell recommendations
(learned from previous studies) are not universal to all software projects.
Conclusion: Before undertaking a code reorganization based on a bad smell
report, use a tool like XTREE to check and ignore any such operations that are
useless; i.e. ones which lack evidence in the historical record that it is
useful to make that change. Note that this use case applies to both manual code
reorganizations proposed by developers as well as those conducted by automatic
methods. This recommendation assumes that there is an historical record. If
none exists, then the results of this paper could be used as a guide.

ecosystem is extended to sociology or economics. Diversity can be intended as
the count of different items, animals, or, more generally, interactions. There
are two classes of stylized facts that emerge when diversity is taken into
account. The first are Diversity explosions: evolutionary radiations in
biology, or the process of escaping 'Poverty Traps' in economics are two well
known examples. The second is nestedness: entities with a very diverse set of
interactions are the only ones that interact with more specialized ones. In a
single sentence: specialists interact with generalists. Nestedness is observed
in a variety of bipartite networks of interactions: Biogeographic,
macroeconomic and mutualistic to name a few. This indicates that entities
diversify following a pattern. Since they appear in such very different
systems, these two stylized facts point out that the build up of diversity is
driven by a fundamental probabilistic mechanism, and here we sketch its minimal
features. We show how the contraction of a random tripartite network, which is
maximally entropic in all its degree distributions but one, can reproduce
stylized facts of real data with great accuracy which is qualitatively lost
when that degree distribution is changed. We base our reasoning on the
combinatoric picture that the nodes on one layer of these bipartite networks
can be described as combinations of a number of fundamental building blocks.
The stylized facts of diversity that we observe in real systems can be
explained with an extreme heterogeneity (a scale-free distribution) in the
number of meaningful combinations in which each building block is involved. We
show that if the usefulness of the building blocks has a scale-free
distribution, then maximally entropic baskets of building blocks will give rise
to very rich behaviors.

theoretical correctness of this approach. Empirical studies demonstrate the
effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed concepts.

2-regular subgraph. A cycle $C$ is $positive$ if it has an even number of
negative edges, and negative otherwise. A $circuit$ of of a signed graph
$(G,\sigma)$ is a positive cycle or a barbell consisting of two edge-disjoint
negative cycles joined by a path. The definition of a circuit of signed graph
comes from the signed-graphic matroid. A circuit cover of $(G,\sigma)$ is a
family of circuits covering all edges of $(G,\sigma)$. A circuit cover with the
smallest total length is called a shortest circuit cover of $(G,\sigma)$ and
its length is denoted by $\text{scc}(G,\sigma)$. Bouchet proved that a signed
graph with a circuit cover if and only if it is flow-admissible (i.e., has a
nowhere-zero integer flow). M\'a\v{c}ajov\'a et. al. show that a
2-edge-connected signed graph $(G,\sigma)$ has $\text{scc}(G,\sigma)\le 9

3|E(G)|+\epsilon(G,\sigma)/3$ for 2-edge-connected cubic signed graphs with

$(G,\sigma)$). In this paper, we show that every 2-edge-connected cubic signed

$\text{scc}(G,\sigma)\le 23|E(G)|/9$ if it has even negativeness.

the physical layer, which exploits the intrinsic properties of the wireless
medium. Beamforming, which has been proved to have many advantages, can also be
applied to enhance the wireless security.
  One of the most common threats, i.e., passive eavesdropping, is addressed in
this thesis. To reduce the risk of leaking information to the eavesdroppers,
the physical region where the transmission is exposed to eavesdropping has been
studied. In this thesis, the exposure region based beamforming technique is
proposed to combat the threat from the randomly located eavesdroppers in a
fading channel. In this system model, the large-scale path loss and a general
Rician fading channel model are considered. The exposure region is established
to describe the secrecy performance of the system, based on which the
probability that the secrecy outage event occurs is defined to evaluate the
security level of the exposure region.
  The antenna array is one of the most important factors that affect the
secrecy performance of the exposure region based beamforming technique. The
potential of using different array geometry and array configuration to improve
security is explored. In this thesis, two common arrays, i.e., linear and
circular arrays, are considered.Analytic expressions for general array geometry
and for the linear and circular arrays are derived. Based on the empirical
results, numerical optimization algorithms are developed to exploit the array
configuration to enhance the system security level. In addition, experiments
are carried out to study the performance of the beamformer with linear and
circular arrays. Especially, the impact of the mutual coupling on the security
performance is investigated.

the literature. In the attached erratum we fix the problem by establishing a
slightly weaker version of Theorem 7.1 and use it to give a new proof of
Theorem 4.2. This ensures that all main results in our main article remain
correct. We thank Zhengxing Lian and Jiahao Qiu for bringing this mistake to
our attention.

participants in events and events without entities are uncommon. The
interpretation of events and entities is highly contextually dependent.
Existing work in information extraction typically models events separately from
entities, and performs inference at the sentence level, ignoring the rest of
the document. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that models the
dependencies among variables of events, entities, and their relations, and
performs joint inference of these variables across a document. The goal is to
enable access to document-level contextual information and facilitate
context-aware predictions. We demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for event extraction as well as a
strong baseline for entity extraction.

some periodic orbits in annular billiards in which the scatterer is touching or

periodic orbits of arbitrary period for scatterers with decreasing radii that
are located near the boundary of the disk. As the position of the scatterer
moves away from a symmetry line of a periodic orbit, the stability of periodic
orbits changes from elliptic to hyperbolic, corresponding to a saddle-center

is parabolic. We prove that slightly changing the reflection angle of the orbit

Foreman","Subsystems and time in quantum mechanics","41 pages, v2: new subsection ""A guide for the reader""",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates the relationship between subsystems and time in a
closed nonrelativistic system of interacting bosons and fermions. It is
possible to write any state vector in such a system as an unentangled tensor
product of subsystem vectors, and to do so in infinitely many ways. This
requires the superposition of different numbers of particles, but the theory
can describe in full the equivalence relation that leads to a particle-number
superselection rule in conventionally defined subsystems. Time is defined as a
functional of subsystem changes, thus eliminating the need for any reference to
an external time variable. The dynamics of the unentangled subsystem
decomposition is derived from a variational principle of dynamical stability,
which requires the decomposition to change as little as possible in any given
infinitesimal time interval, subject to the constraint that the state of the
total system satisfy the Schroedinger equation. The resulting subsystem
dynamics is deterministic. This determinism is regarded as a conceptual tool
that observers can use to make inferences about the outside world, not as a law
of nature. The experiences of each observer define some properties of that
observer's subsystem during an infinitesimal interval of time (i.e., the
present moment); everything else must be inferred from this information. The
overall structure of the theory has some features in common with quantum
Bayesianism, the Everett interpretation, and dynamical reduction models, but it
differs significantly from all of these. The theory of information described
here is largely qualitative, as the most important equations have not yet been
solved. The quantitative level of agreement between theory and experiment thus
remains an open question.

locally along with a new bounded control algorithm. Theoretical analysis is
then provided to show that the proposed network topology control technique can

They are complementary to the object contour, and provide extra information,
such as how object scale (thickness) varies among object parts. But object
skeleton extraction from natural images is very challenging, because it
requires the extractor to be able to capture both local and non-local image
context in order to determine the scale of each skeleton pixel. In this paper,
we present a novel fully convolutional network with multiple scale-associated
side outputs to address this problem. By observing the relationship between the
receptive field sizes of the different layers in the network and the skeleton
scales they can capture, we introduce two scale-associated side outputs to each
stage of the network. The network is trained by multi-task learning, where one
task is skeleton localization to classify whether a pixel is a skeleton pixel
or not, and the other is skeleton scale prediction to regress the scale of each
skeleton pixel. Supervision is imposed at different stages by guiding the
scale-associated side outputs toward the groundtruth skeletons at the
appropriate scales. The responses of the multiple scale-associated side outputs
are then fused in a scale-specific way to detect skeleton pixels using multiple
scales effectively. Our method achieves promising results on two skeleton
extraction datasets, and significantly outperforms other competitors.
Additionally, the usefulness of the obtained skeletons and scales (thickness)
are verified on two object detection applications: Foreground object
segmentation and object proposal detection.

surfaces (potentially) relevant to the study of Torelli groups. The extension
problem in Torelli topology is the problem of determining when a diffeomorphism
of compact connected subsurface of a closed surface can be extended to a
diffeomorphism of the whole surface acting trivially on its homology. The
special case of extensions by the identity diffeomorphism was considered by A.
Putman, whose work was one of the main sources of inspiration for the present
paper.
  It turns out that the answer depends on the position of the subsurface, but
only in a mild and controlled way discovered by A. Putman in the special case
of extensions by the identity. The answer is stated in terms of two homology
groups associated to the subsurface and a homomorphism between them, which we
call the difference map of a diffeomorphism of the subsurface in question.
  The extension problem is motivated by the desire to extend to Torelli groups
some well established tools and results from the theory of Teichm\""uller
modular groups. In particular, in the next paper of this series the analysis of
the extension problem in this paper will be applied to get a description of all
abelian subgroups of Torelli groups. The paper is concluded by some
speculations about what is the Torelli group of a surface with non-empty
boundary.

the largest delay at which the pursuer can enter and still have a guaranteed

larger than the signal created by the orbit of Earth-twins, thus preventing
their detection. The goal of this paper is to compare the efficiency of the
different methods used to deal with stellar signals to recover extremely
low-mass planets despite. However, because observed RV variations at the m/s
precision level or below is a combination of signals induced by unresolved
orbiting planets, by the star, and by the instrument, performing such a
comparison using real data is extremely challenging. To circumvent this
problem, we generated simulated RV measurements including realistic stellar and
planetary signals. Different teams analyzed blindly those simulated RV
measurements, using their own method to recover planetary signals despite
stellar RV signals. By comparing the results obtained by the different teams
with the planetary and stellar parameters used to generate the simulated RVs,
it is therefore possible to compare the efficiency of these different methods.
The most efficient methods to recover planetary signals {take into account the
different activity indicators,} use red-noise models to account for stellar RV
signals and a Bayesian framework to provide model comparison in a robust
statistical approach. Using the most efficient methodology, planets can be
found down to K/N= K_pl/RV_rms*sqrt{N_obs}=5 with a threshold of K/N=7.5 at the
level of 80-90% recovery rate found for a number of methods. These recovery
rates drop dramatically for K/N smaller than this threshold. In addition, for
the best teams, no false positives with K/N > 7.5 were detected, while a
non-negligible fraction of them appear for smaller K/N. A limit of K/N = 7.5
seems therefore a safe threshold to attest the veracity of planetary signals
for RV measurements with similar properties to those of the different RV
fitting challenge systems.

  Recommendation","Recsys Workshop on Deep Learning for Recommendation Systems (DLRS
  '16)",,,,"cs.LG cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recommender systems often use latent features to explain the behaviors of
users and capture the properties of items. As users interact with different
items over time, user and item features can influence each other, evolve and
co-evolve over time. The compatibility of user and item's feature further
influence the future interaction between users and items. Recently, point
process based models have been proposed in the literature aiming to capture the
temporally evolving nature of these latent features. However, these models
often make strong parametric assumptions about the evolution process of the
user and item latent features, which may not reflect the reality, and has
limited power in expressing the complex and nonlinear dynamics underlying these
processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep coevolutionary
network model (DeepCoevolve), for learning user and item features based on
their interaction graph. DeepCoevolve use recurrent neural network (RNN) over
evolving networks to define the intensity function in point processes, which
allows the model to capture complex mutual influence between users and items,
and the feature evolution over time. We also develop an efficient procedure for
training the model parameters, and show that the learned models lead to
significant improvements in recommendation and activity prediction compared to
previous state-of-the-arts parametric models.

vast quantities of corresponding ground truth depth data for training. Just
recording quality depth data in a range of environments is a challenging
problem. In this paper, we innovate beyond existing approaches, replacing the
use of explicit depth data during training with easier-to-obtain binocular
stereo footage.
  We propose a novel training objective that enables our convolutional neural
network to learn to perform single image depth estimation, despite the absence
of ground truth depth data. Exploiting epipolar geometry constraints, we
generate disparity images by training our network with an image reconstruction
loss. We show that solving for image reconstruction alone results in poor
quality depth images. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel training
loss that enforces consistency between the disparities produced relative to
both the left and right images, leading to improved performance and robustness
compared to existing approaches. Our method produces state of the art results
for monocular depth estimation on the KITTI driving dataset, even outperforming
supervised methods that have been trained with ground truth depth.

function $\ln\Gamma(z)$ for complex $z$ in the right half-plane. These improve
on earlier bounds by Behnke and Sommer (1962), Spira (1971), and Hare (1997).
We show that $|R_{k+1}(z)/T_k(z)| < \sqrt{\pi k}$ for nonzero $z$ in the right
half-plane, where $T_k(z)$ is the $k$-th term in the asymptotic series, and
$R_{k+1}(z)$ is the error incurred in truncating the series after $k$ terms. If
$k \le |z|$, then the stronger bound $|R_{k+1}(z)/T_k(z)| < (k/|z|)^2/(\pi^2-1)

$\ln\Gamma(z+\frac{1}{2})$, except that a factor $\eta_k = 1/(1-2^{1-2k})$
multiplies some of the bounds.
  We deduce similar bounds for asymptotic approximation of the Riemann-Siegel
theta function $\vartheta(t)$. We show that the accuracy of a well-known
approximation to $\vartheta(t)$ can be improved by including an exponentially
small term in the approximation. This improves the attainable accuracy for real
$t>0$ from $O(\exp(-\pi t))$ to $O(\exp(-2\pi t))$. We discuss a similar
example due to Olver (1964), and a connection with the Stokes phenomenon.

destination, $K+1$ time or frequency slots are required for a single frame
transmission. However, without the relays, only one time or frequency slot is
used for a single frame transmission. Therefore, despite the benefits of
relaying systems, this type of communications is not efficient from the
spectral efficiency viewpoint. One solution to reduce this issue might be the
full-duplex (FD) relays. An old technique which is reconsidered recently to
improve the spectral efficiency of telecommunication systems. However, FD
relays have a certain complexity, so, some similar techniques such as
successive relays with nearly the same performance but less complexity is taken
into account now. In successive relaying systems, two relays between the source
and destination are employed which receive the transmitted frames from the
source and relay it to the destination successively. This structure generally
acts like an FD relays. In this paper, the effective capacity performance of an
amplify and forward (AF) successive relaying systems with power allocation
strategy at the relays are studied perfectly. However, while the inter-rely
interference (IRI) between two successive relays has to be managed well, the
power allocation and the effective capacity is derived under different
assumptions about the IRI. In this way, we assume weak or strong, short or
long-term constraints on the IRI. Then we extract the optimal transmitted power
at the relay to maximize the effective capacity under these constraints.

spectrum for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 11
CMASS galaxies in the North Galactic Cap (NGC) based on the method developed by
Jing & Borner (2001). In this method, we first measure the 2D redshift-space
correlation function for the CMASS galaxies, and obtain the 2D power spectrum
based on Fourier Transform of the correlation function. The method is tested
with an N-body mock galaxy catalog, which demonstrates that the method can
yield an accurate and unbiased measurement of the redshift-space power spectrum
given the input 2D correlation function is correct. Compared with previous
measurements in literature that are usually based on direct Fourier Transform
in redshift space, our method has the advantages that the window function and
shot-noise are fully corrected. In fact, our 2D power spectrum, by its
construction, can accurately reproduce the 2D correlation function, and in the
meanwhile can reproduce, for example, the 2D power spectrum of Beutler et al.
(2014) accurately if ours is convolved with the window function they provided.
Thus, our measurement can facilitate a direct comparison with the theoretical
predictions. With this accurate measurement of the 2D power spectrum, we then
develop a method to measure the structure growth rate, by separating the
anisotropic redshift-space power spectrum from the isotropic real-space power
spectrum. We have also carefully corrected for the nonlinearities in the
mapping from real space to redshift space, according to the theoretical model
of Zhang et al. (2013). Finally, we obtain f(zeff)sigma_8(zeff)=0.438\pm0.037
at the effective redshift zeff=0.57, where f(zeff) is the linear growth rate at
redshift zeff. The result is useful for constraining cosmological parameters.
The measurements of 2D power spectrum will be released soon.

pressure-robustness, as shown recently for several inf-sup stable Stokes

is extended to low and high order Taylor-Hood and mini elements, which have
continuous discrete pressures. For the modification of the right hand side a
velocity reconstruction operator is constructed that maps discretely
divergence-free test functions to exactly divergence-free ones. The
reconstruction is based on local $H(\mathrm{div})$-conforming flux
equilibration on vertex patches, and fulfills certain orthogonality properties
to provide consistency and optimal a-priori error estimates. Numerical examples

Generally speaking, each agent's strategy in a mechanism has two possible

and claim that the notion of Bayesian Nash equilibrium of a mechanism should be
based on a profit function instead of the conventional utility function when

vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is proposed. The proposed approach
exploits the spatio-temporal traffic patterns, in terms of load and vehicles'
physical proximity, to minimize the total network cost which captures the
tradeoffs between load (i.e., service delay) and successful transmissions while
satisfying vehicles's quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. To solve the
optimization problem under slowly varying channel information, it is decoupled
the problem into two interrelated subproblems. First, a dynamic clustering
mechanism is proposed to group vehicles in zones based on their traffic
patterns and proximity information. Second, a matching game is proposed to
allocate resources for each V2V pair within each zone. The problem is cast as
many-to-one matching game in which V2V pairs and resource blocks (RBs) rank one
another in order to minimize their service delay. The proposed game is shown to
belong to the class of matching games with externalities. To solve this game, a
distributed algorithm is proposed using which V2V pairs and RBs interact to
reach a stable matching. Simulation results for a Manhattan model shown that
the proposed scheme yields a higher percentage of V2V pairs satisfying QoS as
well as significant gain in terms of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio (SINR) as compared to a state-of-art resource allocation baseline.

investigate thermodynamic phases and corresponding electronic structures of the
Weyl semimetal in the strong onsite Coulomb interaction limit. Based on a
minimum model of the Weyl semimetal with two linear Weyl nodes, it is shown
that generically the Weyl semimetal becomes magnetic in the presence of
interactions. In particular, it is shown that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
exchange interaction is generally induced so that the A-type antiferromagnetic
(A-AFM) phase and the spiral spin density wave (SSDW) states are two generic
phases. Furthermore, we find that Weyl nodes proliferate and it is possible to
doubly enhance the unusual properties of non-interacting Weyl semimetals
through the realization of double-Weyl nodes in strong correlation limit.
Specifically, it is shown that in the SSDW phase, linear Weyl nodes are tuned
into double-Weyl nodes with the corresponding charges being $\pm 2$. As the
spin-orbit coupling increases, a quantum phase transition occurs with the SSDW
phase being turned into an A-AFM phase and at the same time, double-Weyl nodes
are disintegrated into two pairs of linear Weyl nodes. Our results reveal the

Although the temporal evolution of active regions (ARs) is relatively
well understood, the processes involved continue to be the subject of
investigation. We study how the magnetic field of a series of ARs evolves with
time to better characterise how ARs emerge and disperse. Methods. We examine
the temporal variation in the magnetic field distribution of 37 emerging ARs. A
kernel density estimation plot of the field distribution was created on a
log-log scale for each AR at each time step. We found that the central portion
of the distribution is typically linear and its slope was used to characterise
the evolution of the magnetic field. Results. The slopes were seen to evolve
with time, becoming less steep as the fragmented emerging flux coalesces. The
slopes reached a maximum value of ~ -1.5 just before the time of maximum flux
before becoming steeper during the decay phase towards the quiet Sun value of ~
-3. This behaviour differs significantly from a classical diffusion model,
which produces a slope of -1. These results suggest that simple classical
diffusion is not responsible for the observed changes in field distribution,
but that other processes play a significant role in flux dispersion.
Conclusions. We propose that the steep negative slope seen during the late
decay phase is due to magnetic flux reprocessing by (super)granular convective
cells.

population dynamics. These models are characterised by prescribing particle
motion on two spatial scales: microscopic and macroscopic. At the microscopic
level, each particle has its own mass, position and velocity, while at the
macroscopic level the particles are interpolated to a continuum quantity whose
evolution is governed by a system of transport equations. This way, one can
prescribe various types of interactions on a global scale, whilst still
maintaining high simulation speed for a large number of particles. In addition,
the interplay between particle motion and interaction is well tuned in both
regions of low and high densities.
  We analyse links between models on these two scales and prove that under
certain conditions, a system of interacting particles converges to a nonlinear
coupled system of transport equations. We use this as a motivation to derive a
model defined on both modelling scales and prescribe the intercommunication
between them. Simulation takes place in inhomogeneous domains with arbitrary
conditions at inflow and outflow boundaries. We realise this by modelling
obstacles, sources and sinks. Integrating these aspects into the simulation
requires a route planning algorithm for the particles. Several algorithms are
considered and evaluated on accuracy, robustness and efficiency.
  All aspects mentioned above are combined in a novel open source prototyping
simulation framework called Mercurial. This computational framework allows the
design of geometries and is built for high performance when large numbers of
particles are involved. Mercurial supports various types of inhomogeneities and
global systems of equations.
  We apply our framework to simulate scenarios in crowd dynamics. We compare

  Recent works also attempt to use algebraic tools to reduce the cryptanalysis
of a block cipher algorithm to the resolution of a system of quadratic
equations describing the ciphering structure.
  In our study, we will also use algebraic tools but in a new way: by using
Boolean functions and their properties. A Boolean function is a function from
$F_2^n\to F_2$ with $n>1$, characterized by its truth table. The arguments of
Boolean functions are binary words of length $n$. Any Boolean function can be
represented, uniquely, by its algebraic normal form which is an equation which
only contains additions modulo 2 - the XOR function - and multiplications
modulo 2 - the AND function.
  Our aim is to describe the AES algorithm as a set of Boolean functions then
calculate their algebraic normal forms by using the M\""obius transforms. After,
we use a specific representation for these equations to facilitate their
analysis and particularly to try a combinatorial analysis. Through this
approach we obtain a new kind of equations system. This equations system is
more easily implementable and could open new ways to cryptanalysis.

combinatorial optimization problems of covering type. In spite of their
widespread use, these inequalities yield linear programming (LP) relaxations of
exponential size, over which it is not known how to optimize exactly in
polynomial time. In this paper we address this issue and obtain LP relaxations
of quasi-polynomial size that are at least as strong as that given by the
knapsack cover inequalities.
  For the min-knapsack cover problem, our main result can be stated formally as
follows: for any $\varepsilon >0$, there is a $(1/\varepsilon)^{O(1)}n^{O(\log
n)}$-size LP relaxation with an integrality gap of at most $2+\varepsilon$,
where $n$ is the number of items. Prior to this work, there was no known
relaxation of subexponential size with a constant upper bound on the
integrality gap.
  Our construction is inspired by a connection between extended formulations
and monotone circuit complexity via Karchmer-Wigderson games. In particular,
our LP is based on $O(\log^2 n)$-depth monotone circuits with fan-in~$2$ for
evaluating weighted threshold functions with $n$ inputs, as constructed by
Beimel and Weinreb. We believe that a further understanding of this connection
may lead to more positive results complementing the numerous lower bounds
recently proved for extended formulations.

strongly with decreased temperature, indicating a phonon limited transport. The
conductivity of the semiconducting SnSe$_{2}$ shows a metallic behavior, which

circulation (LSC) are modulated by the forcing, exhibiting a variety of
dynamics including increasing phase delays and a resonant peak in the amplitude
of $\dot{\theta}$(t). We also focus on the influence of modulated rotation
rates on the frequency of occurrence $\eta$ of stochastic
cessation/reorientation events, and on the interplay between such events and
the periodically modulated response of $\dot{\theta}$(t). Here we identify a
mechanism by which $\eta$ can be amplfied by the modulated response and these
normally stochastic events can occur with high regularity. We provide a
modeling framework that explains the observed amplitude and phase responses,
and extend this approach to make predictions for the occurrence of cessation
events and the probability distributions of $\dot{\theta}$(t) and $\delta$(t)
during different phases of a modulation cycle, based on an adiabatic approach
that treats each phase separately. Lastly, we show that such periodic forcing
has consequences beyond influencing LSC dynamics, by investigating how it can
modify the heat transport even under conditions where the Ekman pumping effect
is predominant and strong enhancement of heat transport occurs. We identify
phase and amplitude responses of the heat transport, and show how increased

a need for process isolation on a shared platform. Existing virtual machine and
container technologies are often more complex than traditional Unix utilities,
like chroot, and often require root privileges in order to set up or use. This
is especially challenging on HPC systems where users typically do not have root
access. We therefore present nsroot, a lightweight Linux namespaces based
process isolation tool. It allows restricting the runtime environment of data
analysis tools that may not have been designed with security as a top priority,
in order to reduce the risk and consequences of security breaches, without
requiring any special privileges. The codebase of nsroot is small, and it
provides a command line interface similar to chroot. It can be used on all
Linux kernels that implement user namespaces. In addition, we propose combining
nsroot with the AppImage format for secure execution of packaged applications.

mass function is converted to the BH mass function for any given redshift. The
high-redshift optical AGN luminosity functions (LFs) are constructed. At $z\sim

This is consistent with observational results. If the optical AGN LF at $z\sim

Eddington-limited accretion, it is possible for the AGN lifetime to have a
small value of $2\times 10^5$ yrs. The X-ray AGN LFs and X-ray AGN number
counts are also calculated at $2.0<z<5.0$ and $z>3$, respectively, using the

mass range of $10^6-10^8M_\odot$. We also discuss some uncertainties in both

states with random basis measurements, where the estimation error is expressed
terms of two metrics - the Frobenius norm and quantum infidelity. It is known
that unlike the case of general full state tomography, low rank states can be
identified from a reduced number of observables' expectations. Here we
investigate whether for a fixed sample size $N$, the estimation error
associated to a `compressive' measurement setup is `close' to that of the
setting where a large number of bases are measured. In terms of the Frobenius
norm, we demonstrate that for all states the error attains the optimal rate
$rd/N$ with only $O(r \log{d})$ random basis measurements. We provide an
illustrative example of a single qubit and demonstrate a concentration in the
Frobenius error about its optimal for all qubit states. In terms of the quantum
infidelity, we show that such a concentration does not exist uniformly over all
states. Specifically, we show that for states that are nearly pure and close to
the surface of the Bloch sphere, the mean infidelity scales as $1/\sqrt{N}$ but
the constant converges to zero as the number of settings is increased. This
demonstrates a lack of `compressive' recovery for nearly pure states in this
metric.

solutions, using deep reinforcement learning to learn a controller directly
from raw sensor data, rather than relying on a hand-crafted, modular pipeline.
However, the high dimensionality of the state space often means that it is
impractical to generate sufficient training data with real-world experiments.
As an alternative solution, we propose to learn a robot controller in
simulation, with the potential of then transferring this to a real robot.
Building upon the recent success of deep Q-networks, we present an approach
which uses 3D simulations to train a 7-DOF robotic arm in a control task
without any prior knowledge. The controller accepts images of the environment
as its only input, and outputs motor actions for the task of locating and
grasping a cube, over a range of initial configurations. To encourage efficient
learning, a structured reward function is designed with intermediate rewards.
We also present preliminary results in direct transfer of policies over to a
real robot, without any further training.

backhaul link from the macro system, such that the macro system is able to
transmit the information of the distance to the SBS through the backhaul link.
However, there may not exist any backhaul link from the macro system to the SBS

constitutes a good compromise between several input graphs, each provided by a
different source. One needs to perform graph aggregation in a wide variety of
situations, e.g., when applying a voting rule (graphs as preference orders),
when consolidating conflicting views regarding the relationships between
arguments in a debate (graphs as abstract argumentation frameworks), or when
computing a consensus between several alternative clusterings of a given
dataset (graphs as equivalence relations). In this paper, we introduce a formal
framework for graph aggregation grounded in social choice theory. Our focus is
on understanding which properties shared by the individual input graphs will
transfer to the output graph returned by a given aggregation rule. We consider
both common properties of graphs, such as transitivity and reflexivity, and
arbitrary properties expressible in certain fragments of modal logic. Our
results establish several connections between the types of properties preserved
under aggregation and the choice-theoretic axioms satisfied by the rules used.
The most important of these results is a powerful impossibility theorem that
generalises Arrow's seminal result for the aggregation of preference orders to
a large collection of different types of graphs.

in the vicinity of galaxies, such as extra-planar-gas, tails and filaments.
These structures are crucial for understanding galaxy evolution, particularly
when they are studied in relation to the local environment. Our aim is to find
optimized kernels for the discovery of faint and morphologically complex HI
structures. Therefore, using HI data from a variety of galaxies, we explore
state-of-the-art filtering algorithms. We show that the intensity-driven
gradient filter, due to its adaptive characteristics, is the optimal choice. In
fact, this filter requires only minimal tuning of the input parameters to
enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of faint components. In addition, it does not
degrade the resolution of the high signal-to-noise component of a source. The
filtering process must be fast and be embedded in an interactive visualization
tool in order to support fast inspection of a large number of sources. To
achieve such interactive exploration, we implemented a multi-core CPU (OpenMP)
and a GPU (OpenGL) version of this filter in a 3D visualization environment

double beta-decays). Therefore, a demonstrator setup using coplanar-grid CdZnTe
detectors is operated at the LNGS underground laboratory. In this work, the
demonstrator was commissioned and completed, which is discussed extensively.
The demonstrator works reliably and collects low-background physics data. One
result of the analysis of the data is that surface events are the dominating
background component. To better understand and possibly discriminate this
background, surface events were studied in detail. This was done mainly using
laboratory measurements. For a better interpretation of these measurements,
simulations of particle trajectories and ranges were done. The surface
sensitivity tests showed large differences between the individual detectors.
Often, a dead-layer was determined, especially at the surfaces where the
non-collecting anode (NCA) is the outermost anode rail. Due to this, the
sensitivity of the surfaces where the collecting anode (CA) is adjacent was
typically about a factor of three larger than the NCA sensitivity. A comparison
of the pulse shape analysis methods LSE and A/E was done. Laboratory
measurements indicate, that the latter performs better. Alpha scanning
measurements were done to spatially investigate the surface sensitivity.
Plausible variations were measured. However, no hints were found how to improve
the surface event recognition. The instrumentation of the guard ring, which
surrounds the anode structure, was tested and improved the surface event
discrimination significantly. The fraction of surviving alpha events was at a
per-mill level. Important steps for a future large-scale COBRA experiment are
discussed briefly, mainly the use of an integrated read-out system. Overall,
the results indicate a large potential in background reduction for the COBRA
experiment.

PG-EXTRA and ExtraPush to a new algorithm PG-ExtraPush for composite consensus

proximity operator like in PG-EXTRA to deal with the nonsmooth term, and
employs the push-sum protocol like in ExtraPush to tackle the bias introduced
by the directed network. With a proper step size, we show that PG-ExtraPush
converges to an optimal solution at a linear rate under some regular

effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Specifically, with a proper step size,
PG-ExtraPush performs linear rates in most of cases, even in some nonconvex

that multi-body transverse interactions like $XX$ and $XXXXX$ with positive

the simple transverse-field case to a second-order transition. This implies
that the efficiency of quantum annealing is exponentially enhanced, because a
first-order transition has an exponentially small energy gap (and therefore
exponentially long computation time) whereas a second-order transition has a
polynomially decaying gap (polynomial computation time). The examples presented

the uncertainty of the density profile is calculated by a Markov Chain Monte

spectrometer, the Li line intensities are extracted, and modelled as a function
of the plasma density by a multi-state model which describes the relevant

model fully takes into account interference filter and instrument effects, that
are separately estimated, again using Gaussian processes. The line intensities
are inferred based on a spectral model consistent with the measured spectra
within their uncertainties, which includes photon statistics and electronic
noise. Our newly developed method to infer JET edge electron density profiles
has the following advantages in comparison to the conventional method: i)
providing full posterior distributions of edge density profiles, including

profiles is increased to the full observation range (~26 cm), iii) an
assumption of monotonic electron density profile is not necessary, iv) the

into stars? To answer this, we need to be able to estimate the H2 mass.
Traditionally, this is done using CO and a few assumptions but the Herschel
observations in the FIR make it possible to estimate the molecular gas mass
independently of CO. Previous attempts to derive gas masses from dust emission
suffered from biases. Generally, dust surface densities, HI column densities,
and CO intensities are used to derive a gas-to-dust ratio (GDR) and the local
CO intensity to H2 column density ratio (XCO), sometimes allowing for an
additional CO-dark gas component (Kdark). We tested earlier methods, revealing
degeneracies among the parameters, and then used a Bayesian formalism to derive
the most likely values for each of the parameters mentioned above as a function
of position in the nearby low metallicity spiral galaxy M33. The data are from
the IRAM 30m CO(2-1) line, high-resolution HI and Herschel dust continuum
observations. Solving for GDR, XCO, and Kdark in macro pixels 500 pc in size,
we find that (i) allowing for CO-dark gas significantly improves fits; (ii)
Kdark decreases with galactocentric distance; (iii) GDR is slightly higher than
initially expected and increases with galactocentric distance; (iv) the total
amount of dark gas closely follows the radially decreasing CO emission, as
might be expected if the dark gas is H2 where CO is photodissociated. The total
amount of H2, including dark gas, yields an average XCO of twice the galactic
value of 2e20 cm^-2/(K km/s), 55% of this traced directly through CO. The
rather constant fraction of dark gas suggests that there is no large population
of diffuse H2 clouds (unrelated to GMCs) without CO emission. Unlike in large
spirals, we detect no systematic radial trend in XCO, possibly linked to the
absence of a radial decrease in CO line ratios.

viscosity {\eta} and electron heat conductivity {\kappa}, both depending on
temperature. In the optically thin discs it is found that for the heat
conductivity increasing with temperature, the vertical temperature gradient
exceeds the adiabatic value at some height, suggesting convective instability
in the upper disc layer. There is a critical Prandtl number, Pr = 4/9, above
which a Keplerian disc become fully convective. The vertical density
distribution of optically thin laminar accretion discs as found from the
hydrostatic equilibrium equation cannot be generally described by a polytrope
but in the case of constant viscosity and heat conductivity. In the optically
thick discs with radiation heat transfer, the vertical disc structure is found
to be convectively stable for both absorption dominated and scattering
dominated opacities, unless a very steep dependence of the viscosity
coefficient on temperature is assumed. A polytropic-like structure in this case
is found for Thomson scattering dominated opacity.

two SCY's having reduced manifold equal to $\mathbb{P}^1$, namely the
projective super space $\mathbb{P}^{1|2} $ and the weighted projective super

cohomology of superforms, showing that the cohomology with picture number one
is infinite dimensional, while the de Rham cohomology, which is what matters
from a physical point of view, remains finite dimensional. Moreover, we provide
the complete real and holomorphic de Rham cohomology for generic projective
super spaces $\mathbb P^{n|m}$. We also determine the automorphism groups:
these always match the dimension of the projective super group with the only
exception of $\mathbb{P}^{1|2} $, whose automorphism group turns out to be
larger than the projective general linear supergroup. By considering the
cohomology of the super tangent sheaf, we compute the deformations of
$\mathbb{P}^{1|m}$, discovering that the presence of a fermionic structure
allows for deformations even if the reduced manifold is rigid. Finally, we show
that $\mathbb{P}^{1|2} $ is self-mirror, whereas $\mathbb{WP} ^{1|1}_{(2)}$ has
a zero dimensional mirror. Also, the mirror map for $\mathbb{P}^{1|2}$
naturally endows it with a structure of $N=2$ super Riemann surface.

two different knowledge streams and whose knowledge is dominantly persistent in
the knowledge network. The performances of the proposed metrics were evaluated
by how well the metrics can distinguish the designed discontinuity from other
nodes on the knowledge network. The simulation results show that the
persistence times # of converging main paths provides the best performance in
identifying the designed discontinuity: the designed discontinuity was
identified as one of the top 3 patents with 96~99% probability by Metric 5 and
it is, according to the size of a domain, 12~34% better than the performance of
the second best metric. Beyond the simulation analysis, we tested the metrics

The three representative patents associated with a well-known breakthrough
technology in the domain, the giant magneto-resistance (GMR) spin valve sensor,

how well the metrics identify the selected patents as top-ranked patents. The

that become inverted in a sudden gust of wind, to nano-electromechanical

turned inside-out. These systems typically transition from one state to the

elastic energy, before releasing it suddenly to generate rapid motions, as in
the Venus flytrap. Similarly, the beak of the hummingbird snaps through to
catch insects mid-flight, while technological applications are increasingly
exploiting snap-through instabilities. In all of these scenarios, it is the
ability to repeatedly generate fast motions that gives snap-through its
utility. However, estimates of the speed of snap-through suggest that it should
occur more quickly than is usually observed. Here, we study the dynamics of
snap-through in detail, showing that, even without dissipation, the dynamics
slow down close to the snap-through transition. This is reminiscent of the
slowing down observed in critical phenomena, and provides a handheld
demonstration of such phenomena, as well as a new tool for tuning dynamic
responses in applications of elastic bistability.

An opposite view considers the NPS as a distant structure associated with
Galactic nuclear outflows. Constraints on the NPS distance can be obtained by
comparing the foreground IS gas column inferred from X-ray absorption to the
distribution of gas and dust along the line of sight. Absorbing columns towards
shadowing molecular clouds simultaneously constrain the CO-H$_{2}$ conversion
factor. We derived the columns of X-ray absorbing matter NH(abs) from spectral
fitting of dedicated XMM-Newton observations towards the NPS southern terminus
(l=29{\deg}, b=+5 to +11{\deg}). The IS matter distribution was obtained from
absorption lines in stellar spectra, 3D dust maps and emission data, including
high spatial resolution CO measurements recorded for this purpose. NH(abs)
varies from $\simeq$ 4.3 to $\simeq$ 1.3 x 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ along the 19
fields. Relationships between X-ray brightness, absorbing column and hardness
ratio demonstrate a brightness decrease with latitude governed by increasing
absorption. The comparison with absorption data, local and large-scale dust
maps rules out a NPS near side closer than 300 pc. The correlation between
NH(abs) and the reddening increases with the sightline length from 300 pc to 4
kpc and is the tightest with Planck $\tau_{353}$-based reddening, suggesting a
much larger distance. N(H)/E(B-V) $\simeq$ 4.1 x 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$

applicability in such as security monitoring and advertisement recommendation.
Although a variety of methods have been proposed, most of them focus only on
the age-specific facial appearance. However, biological researches have shown
that not only gender but also the aging difference between the male and the
female inevitably affect the age estimation. To our knowledge, so far there
have been two methods that have concerned the gender factor. The first is a
sequential method which first classifies the gender and then performs age
estimation respectively for classified male and female. Although it promotes
age estimation performance because of its consideration on the gender semantic
difference, an accumulation risk of estimation errors is unavoidable. To
overcome drawbacks of the sequential strategy, the second is to regress the age
appended with the gender by concatenating their labels as two dimensional
output using Partial Least Squares (PLS). Although leading to promotion of age
estimation performance, such a concatenation not only likely confuses the
semantics between the gender and age, but also ignores the aging discrepancy
between the male and the female. In order to overcome their shortcomings, in
this paper we propose a unified framework to perform gender-aware age
estimation. The proposed method considers and utilizes not only the semantic
relationship between the gender and the age, but also the aging discrepancy
between the male and the female. Finally, experimental results demonstrate not
only the superiority of our method in performance, but also its good
interpretability in revealing the aging discrepancy.

equations with non-homogeneous boundary conditions. These estimates lead to log
type stability inequalities for the problem of recovering the solution of the
Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations from both boundary and distributed
observations. These inequalities fit the well-known unique continuation result
of Fabre and Lebeau [18]: the distributed observation only depends on interior
measurement of the velocity, and the boundary observation only depends on the
trace of the velocity and of the Cauchy stress tensor measurements. Finally, we
present two applications for such inequalities. First, we apply these estimates
to obtain stability inequalities for the inverse problem of recovering Navier
or Robin boundary coefficients from boundary measurements. Next, we use these
estimates to deduce the rate of convergence of two reconstruction methods of
the Stokes solution from the measurement of Cauchy data: a quasi-reversibility
method and a penalized Kohn-Vogelius method.

  With an appendix by Mark C. Bell","revised final version; to appear in Experimental Mathematics",,,,"math.GR math.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In \cite{Ka14} we produced an algorithm for deciding whether or not an
element $\phi\in Out(F_N)$ is an iwip (""fully irreducible"") automorphism. At
several points that algorithm was rather inefficient as it involved some
general enumeration procedures as well as running several abstract processes in
parallel. In this paper we refine the algorithm from \cite{Ka14} by eliminating
these inefficient features, and also by eliminating any use of mapping class
groups algorithms.
  Our main result is to produce, for any fixed $N\ge 3$, an algorithm which,
given a topological representative $f$ of an element $\phi$ of $Out(F_N)$,
decides in polynomial time in terms of the ""size"" of $f$, whether or not $\phi$
is fully irreducible.
  In addition, we provide a train track criterion of being fully irreducible
which covers all fully irreducible elements of $Out(F_N)$, including both
atoroidal and non-atoroidal ones.
  We also give an algorithm, alternative to that of Turner, for finding all the
indivisible Nielsen paths in an expanding train track map, and estimate the
complexity of this algorithm.
  An appendix by Mark Bell provides a polynomial upper bound, in terms of the
size of the topological representative, on the complexity of the
Bestvina-Handel algorithm \cite{BH92} for finding either an irreducible train
track representative or a topological reduction.

parameters and abundances by fixing log(g) to the seismic one. Our strategy
ensures highly consistent values among all stellar parameters, leading to more
accurate chemical abundances. A comparison of the chemical abundances obtained
here with and without the use of seismic log(g) information has shown that an
underestimated (overestimated) gravity leads to an underestimated
(overestimated) elemental abundance (e.g. [Mg/H] is underestimated by ~0.25 dex
when the gravity is underestimated by 0.5 dex). We then perform a comparison
between the seismic gravities and the spectroscopic gravities presented in the
RAVE DR4 catalogue, extracting a calibration for log(g) of RAVE giants in the
colour interval 0.50<(J - Ks)<0.85. Finally, we show a comparison of the
distances, temperatures, extinctions (and ages) derived here for our RAVE K2-C1

important for objects for which the difference between DR4/DR5 and seismic

prescriptions for all the main processes governing the dust cycle. We follow in
detail the evolution of the abundances of several chemical species (C, O, S,
Si, Fe and Zn) in the gas and dust of a typical dwarf irregular galaxy. The
dwarf irregular galaxy is assumed to evolve with a low but continuous level of
star formation and experience galactic winds triggered by supernova explosions.
We predict the evolution of the gas to dust ratio in such a galaxy and discuss
critically the main processes involving dust, such as dust production by AGB
stars and Type II SNe, destruction and accretion (gas condensation in clouds).
We then apply our model to Damped Lyman-Alpha systems which are believed to be
dwarf irregulars, as witnessed by their abundance patterns. Our main
conclusions are: i) we can reproduce the observed gas to dust ratio in dwarf
galaxies. ii) We find that the process of dust accretion plays a fundamental
role in the evolution of dust and in certain cases it becomes the dominant
process in the dust cycle. On the other hand, dust destruction seems to be a
negligible process in irregulars. iii) Concerning Damped Lyman-Alpha systems,
we show that the observed gas-phase abundances of silicon, normalized to
volatile elements (zinc and sulfur), are in agreement with our model. iv) The
abundances of iron and silicon in DLA systems suggest that the two elements
undergo a different history of dust formation and evolution. Our work casts
light on the nature of iron-rich dust: the observed depletion pattern of iron
is well reproduced only when an additional source of iron dust is considered.
Here we explore the possibility of a contribution from Type Ia SNe as well as
an efficient accretion of iron nano-particles.

different objectives, namely system sum throughput maximization and
maximization of the minimum individual throughput across all wireless powered

with a one-dimensional search to obtain an efficient resource allocation
algorithm. Numerical results reveal that a significant performance gain can be
achieved when the resource allocation is designed based on the adopted
non-linear EH model instead of the conventional linear EH model. Besides,
unlike a non-robust baseline scheme designed for perfect CSI, the proposed

biology which is still far from completely understood. The fundamental
cytoskeleton structure of cilia and flagella is the axoneme, a cylindrical
array of microtubule doublets connected by passive crosslinkers and dynein
motor proteins. The complex interplay of these elements leads to the generation
of self-organized bending waves. Although many mathematical models have been
proposed to understand this process, few attempts have been made to assess the
role of dyneins on the nonlinear nature of the axoneme. Here, we investigate
the nonlinear dynamics of flagella by considering an axonemal sliding control
mechanism for dynein activity. This approach unveils the nonlinear selection of
the oscillation amplitudes, which are typically either missed or prescribed in
mathematical models. The explicit set of nonlinear equations are derived and
solved numerically. Our analysis reveals the spatiotemporal dynamics of dynein
populations and flagellum shape for different regimes of motor activity, medium
viscosity and flagellum elasticity. Unstable modes saturate via the coupling of
dynein kinetics and flagellum shape without the need of invoking a nonlinear
axonemal response. Hence, our work reveals a novel mechanism for the saturation
of unstable modes in axonemal beating.

Whether neutral or doped, DB lines are prone to suffer geometrical distortions

to manipulate the position of the Fermi level, moving it away from the gap.
Transport calculations demonstrate that the metallic conduction in the DB-dimer

  We present a new algorithm, called HNSolve, which guides the variable

reasoning about network encodings of nonlinear PDDL+ planning as HAs. HNSolve
tightly integrates with dReal by solving a discrete abstraction of the HA
network. HNSolve finds composite runs on the HA network that ignore continuous
variables, but respect mode jumps and synchronization labels. HNSolve
admissibly detects dead-ends in the discrete abstraction, and posts conflict
clauses that prune the SMT solver's search. We evaluate the benefits of our
HNSolve algorithm on PDDL+ benchmark problems and demonstrate its performance

many strong metal transitions. Using new and archival observations from the
Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) we obtain an extremely high

provides the most precise measurement of $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ from a single

previous similar measurements, including the large samples, was long-range
distortions in the wavelength calibration. These would add a $\sim$2 ppm
systematic error to our measurement and up to $\sim$10 ppm to other

uncertainty, the largest contribution to our total systematic error. A similar
approach, using short observations on future, well-calibrated spectrographs to
correct existing, high S/N spectra, would efficiently enable a large sample of
reliable $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ measurements. The high S/N UVES spectrum also
provides insights into analysis difficulties, detector artifacts and systematic

fails in the Lorentzian analogue anti-de Sitter space: discrete subgroups do
not act properly discontinuously, and in many cases the set of accumulation
points of orbits at the conformal boundary at infinity depends on the orbit. In
this survey, we point out a way to extend this classical theory by introducing
causality notions: the theory of limit sets and regularity domains extend
naturally to achronal subgroups. This is closely related to the notions of
globally hyper-bolic spacetimes, and we present what is known about the
classification of globally hyperbolic spacetimes of constant curvature. We also
review the close connection revealed by G. Mess ([79]) between globally
hyperbolic spacetimes of dimension 2 + 1 and Teichm{\""u}ller space. This link
can be understood via the space of time-like geodesics of anti-de Sitter space,

coexistences can be predicted quantitatively for these systems by measuring the

literature, we find that the coexisting phases are in mechanical equilibrium,
i.e. the two phases have the same pressure. Importantly, we also demonstrate
that the coexisting phases are in chemical equilibrium by bringing each phase
into contact with particle reservoirs, and showing that for each species these
reservoirs are characterized by the same density for both phases. Using this
requirement of mechanical and chemical equilibrium we accurately construct the
phase boundaries from properties which can be measured purely from the
individual coexisting phases. This result highlights that torque-free active
Brownian systems follow simple coexistence rules, thus shedding new light on
their thermodynamics.

microchannels reported by Cubaud and Mason are performed using the parallel
code BLUE for multi-phase flows. The more viscous liquid L_1 is injected into
the channel from the center inlet, and the less viscous liquid L_2 from two
side inlets. Liquid L_1 takes the form of a thin filament due to hydrodynamic
focusing in the long channel that leads to the diverging region. The thread
then becomes unstable to a folding instability, due to the longitudinal
compressive stress applied to it by the diverging flow of liquid L_2. Given the
long computation time, we were limited to a parameter study comprising five
simulations in which the flow rate ratio, the viscosity ratio, the Reynolds
number, and the shape of the channel were varied relative to a reference model.
In our simulations, the cross section of the thread produced by focusing is
elliptical rather than circular. The initial folding axis can be either
parallel or perpendicular to the narrow dimension of the chamber. In the former
case, the folding slowly transforms via twisting to perpendicular folding, or
it may remain parallel. The direction of folding onset is determined by the
velocity profile and the elliptical shape of the thread cross section in the
channel that feeds the diverging part of the cell. Due to the high viscosity
contrast and very low Reynolds numbers, direct numerical simulations of this
two-phase flow are very challenging and to our knowledge these are the first
three-dimensional direct parallel numerical simulations of viscous threads in
microchannels. Our simulations provide good qualitative comparison of the early
time onset of the folding instability however since the computational time for
these simulations is quite long, for such viscous threads, long-time
comparisons with experiments for quantities such as folding frequency are
limited.

strength as the widely studied medium effects from the $\bar K K$ cloud.
Depending on model details (position of the resonances and strength of the

to be added to the $\phi\to\bar K K$ in-medium decay width, and an attractive
optical potential at threshold up to about $35$ MeV at normal matter density.
The $\phi$ spectral function develops a double peak structure as a consequence
of the mixing of resonance-hole modes with the $\phi$ quasi-particle peak. The

using the connectivity information and a predefined brain parcellation, where
the nodes of the network represent the brain regions and the edge weights
capture the connectivity strengths between the corresponding brain regions.
This paper introduces a number of novel scalable methods to generate and

to be an important acceleration mechanism in various astrophysical jet sources,
including radio-loud active galactic nuclei such as blazars. Such acceleration
can produce the non-thermal particles that emit the broadband continuum
radiation that is detected from extragalactic jets. An important recent
development for blazar science is the ability of Fermi-LAT spectroscopy to pin
down the shape of the distribution of the underlying non-thermal particle
population. This paper highlights how multi-wavelength spectra spanning optical
to X-ray to gamma-ray bands can be used to probe diffusive acceleration in
relativistic, oblique, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks in blazar jets.
Diagnostics on the MHD turbulence near such shocks are obtained using thermal

simulations of DSA. These probes are afforded by the characteristic property
that the synchrotron $\nu F_{\nu}$ peak energy does not appear in the gamma-ray
band above 100 MeV. We investigate self-consistently the radiative synchrotron
and inverse Compton signatures of the simulated particle distributions.
Important constraints on the diffusive mean free paths of electrons, and the
level of electromagnetic field turbulence are identified for three different
case study blazars, Mrk 501, BL Lacertae and AO 0235+164. The X-ray excess of
AO 0235+164 in a flare state can be modelled as the signature of bulk Compton
scattering of external radiation fields, thereby tightly constraining the
energy-dependence of the diffusion coefficient for electrons. The concomitant
interpretations that turbulence levels decline with remoteness from jet shocks,
and the probable significant role for non-gyroresonant diffusion, are posited.

(SMBHs) already existed less than 1 Gyr after the Big Bang. Explaining the
formation and growth of the 'seeds' of these SMBHs is quite challenging. We
explore the formation of such seeds in the direct collapse scenario. Using 3D
hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the impact of turbulence and
rotation on the fragmentation behavior of collapsing primordial gas in the
presence of a strong UV radiation background, which keeps the gas hot.
Additionally, we explore different ways in which the collapsing gas may be able
to stay hot, and thus limit fragmentation. Using a one-zone model, we examine
the interplay between magnetic fields, turbulence, and a UV radiation
background.
  Feedback processes from stars and black holes shape the interstellar medium
(ISM) out of which new generations of luminous objects form. To understand the
properties of these objects, e.g. the stellar initial mass function, it is
vital to have knowledge of the chemical and thermodynamical properties of the
feedback-regulated ISM. To better understand the chemo-thermal state and
fragmentation behavior of gas in high-redshift galaxies, we updated, improved,
and extended a photodissociation region code. Our computational code, PDR-Zz,
is described in detail. Using this code, a grid of models is run, covering a
sizable range in physical properties. This allows us to systematically explore
the overall impact of various feedback effects, both radiative and chemical, on
the chemical and thermal balance of the gas in different physical regimes.

low- mass stars has important implications for the formation of planetary
systems. Photo- evaporation from energetic radiation from the central object is
thought to drive the dispersal in the majority of discs, by creating a gap
which disconnects the outer from the inner regions of the disc and then
disperses the outer disc from the inside-out, while the inner disc keeps
draining viscously onto the star. In this Letter we show that the disc around
TW Hya, the closest protoplanetary disc to Earth, may be the first object where
a photoevaporative gap has been imaged around the time at which it is being
created. Indeed the detected gap in the ALMA images is consistent with the
expectations of X-ray photoevaporation models, thus not requiring the presence
of a planet. The photoevaporation model is also consistent with a broad range
of properties of the TW Hya system, e.g. accretion rate and the location of the
gap at the onset of dispersal. We show that the central, unresolved 870 {\mu}m
continuum source might be produced by free free emission from the gas and/or
residual dust inside the gap.

for the incompressible Euler equation and the theory of optimal mass transport.
Recently, several authors have extended optimal transport to the space of
positive Radon measures where the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao distance is a natural
extension of the classical L^2-Wasserstein distance. In this paper, we show a
similar relation between this unbalanced optimal transport problem and the Hdiv
right-invariant metric on the group of diffeomorphisms, which corresponds to
the Camassa-Holm (CH) equation in one dimension. On the optimal transport side,
we prove a polar factorization theorem on the automorphism group of
half-densities.Geometrically, our point of view provides an isometric embedding
of the group of diffeomorphisms endowed with this right-invariant metric in the
automorphisms group of the fiber bundle of half densities endowed with an L^2
type of cone metric. This leads to a new formulation of the (generalized) CH
equation as a geodesic equation on an isotropy subgroup of this automorphisms
group; On S1, solutions to the standard CH thus give particular solutions of
the incompressible Euler equation on a group of homeomorphisms of R^2 which
preserve a radial density that has a singularity at 0. An other application
consists in proving that smooth solutions of the Euler-Arnold equation for the
Hdiv right-invariant metric are length minimizing geodesics for sufficiently
short times.

discotic nematics with very large platelets leads to a remarkable suppression

subdivision network in terms of the Green kernel of the base network. Moreover,
we also obtain the effective resistance and the Kirchhoff index of the
subdivision network in terms of the corresponding parameters on the base
network. Finally, as an example, we carry out the computations in the case of a
wheel.

nonconducting magnetic sample with an excess number of magnons in comparison to
the equilibrium. The phenomenon is considered using the Landau-Lifshits
equation with additional terms describing the longitudinal relaxation of the
magnetization, the magnon diffusion and the magnon creation by external
pumping. The free energy of the system is presented in the mean field
approximation. It is shown that, if the pumping exceeds some critical value,
regions of the new phase arise where the magnetic moments are oriented opposite
to the magnetization of the magnetic sample. The phenomenon is similar to the
appearance of droplets of the condensed phase in the supersaturated vapor. The
appearance of the new phase either in the form of a single domain or a
periodical lattice is demonstrated. The studied process is a competitor to the
process of the Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons.

  aromatase inhibitors",,,,,"q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Combining computational toxicology with ExpoCast exposure
estimates and ToxCast assay data gives us access to predictions of human health
risks stemming from exposures to chemical mixtures.
  Objectives: To explore, through mathematical modeling and simulations, the
size of potential effects of random mixtures of aromatase inhibitors on the
dynamics of women's menstrual cycles.
  Methods: We simulated random exposures to millions of potential mixtures of
86 aromatase inhibitors. A pharmacokinetic model of intake and disposition of
the chemicals predicted their internal concentration as a function of time (up
to two years). A ToxCast aromatase assay provided concentration-inhibition
relationships for each chemical. The resulting total aromatase inhibition was
input to a mathematical model of the hormonal hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian
control of ovulation in women.
  Results: Above 10% inhibition of estradiol synthesis by aromatase inhibitors,
noticeable (eventually reversible) effects on ovulation were predicted.
Exposures to individual chemicals never led to such effects. In our best
estimate, about 10% of the combined exposures simulated had mild to
catastrophic impacts on ovulation. A lower bound on that figure, obtained using
an optimistic exposure scenario, was 0.3%.
  Conclusions: These results demonstrate the possibility to predict large-scale
mixture effects for endocrine disrupters with a predictive toxicology approach,
suitable for high-throughput ranking and risk assessment. The size of the
effects predicted is consistent with an increased risk of infertility in women
from everyday exposures to our chemical environment.

surfaces. In particular, instead of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol
written in the form of a bi-dimensional row, where the elements are made up
with 256 bits, we propose a key exchange protocol given in a matrix form, with
four independent entries each of them constructed with 64 bits. Apart from the
great advantage of significantly reducing the number of used bits, this
methodology appears to be immune to attacks of the style of Western, Miller,
and Adleman, and at the same time it is also able to reach the same level of
security as the cryptographic system presently obtained by the Microsoft
Digital Rights Management. A nonlinear differential equation (NDE) admitting
the elliptic curves as a special case is also proposed. The study of the class
of solutions of this NDE is in progress.

as a means of inducing sparsity in Bayesian inference. Applications domains
that benefit from the use of these priors include sparse recovery, regression
and classification. It is well-known that solving for the sparse coefficient
vector to maximize these priors results in a hard non-convex and mixed integer
programming problem. Most existing solutions to this optimization problem
either involve simplifying assumptions/relaxations or are computationally
expensive. We propose a new greedy and adaptive matching pursuit (AMP)
algorithm to directly solve this hard problem. Essentially, in each step of the
algorithm, the set of active elements would be updated by either adding or
removing one index, whichever results in better improvement. In addition, the
intermediate steps of the algorithm are calculated via an inexpensive Cholesky
decomposition which makes the algorithm much faster. Results on simulated data
sets as well as real-world image recovery challenges confirm the benefits of
the proposed AMP, particularly in providing a superior cost-quality trade-off
over existing alternatives.

This paper reports on a systematic literature review of privacy-preserving
solutions appearing in the research literature and in the media. We analysed
proposed solutions in terms of the techniques they deployed and the extent to
which they satisfied core privacy principles. We found that very few solutions
satisfied all core privacy principles. We also identified a number of key
knowledge gaps in the course of the analysis. In particular, we found that most
solution providers assumed that end users would be willing to expend effort to
preserve their privacy; that they would be motivated to act to preserve their
privacy. The validity of this assumption needs to be proved, since it cannot
simply be assumed that people would necessarily be willing to engage with these
solutions. We suggest this as a topic for future research.
