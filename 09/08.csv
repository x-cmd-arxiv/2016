uncertain mainly because of the lack of any information about its intrinsic

obtain constraints about the geometrical properties of the DSO. We find out
that DSO is an intrinsically polarized source, based on the significance
analysis of polarization parameters, with the degree of the polarization of
$\sim 30\%$ and an alternating polarization angle as it approaches the position
of Sgr A*. Since the DSO exhibits a near-infrared excess of $K_{\rm s}-L'>3$
and remains rather compact in emission-line maps, its main characteristics may
be explained with the model of a pre-main-sequence star embedded in a
non-spherical dusty envelope.

photo-detection platform that combines a ferroelectric substrate (a z-cut
LiNbO3 crystal) and a graphene layer transferred on top of its surface with
electrical connections. Upon strong light absorption in the LiNbO3 substrate
and the subsequent temperature increase, via the pyroelectric effect,
polarization (bound) charges form at the crystal surface. These causes doping
into graphene which in turn changes its carrier density and conductivity. In
this way, by monitoring the graphene electrical resistance one can measure the
incident optical power. . Detectivities of about 10^5 cm sqrt(Hz)/W in the 6 to
10 microns wavelength region are demonstrated.We explain the underlying
physical mechanism of the pyro-resistive photo-detection and propose a model
that reproduces accurately the experimental results. We also show that up to
two orders of magnitude larger detectivity can be achieved by optimising the
geometry and operating in vacuum, thus opening the path to a new class of
mid-IR photo-detectors that can challenge classical HgCdTe devices, especially
in real applications where cooling is to be avoided and low cost is crucial.

  Neural Networks","14 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Biological neurons communicate with a sparing exchange of pulses - spikes. It
is an open question how real spiking neurons produce the kind of powerful
neural computation that is possible with deep artificial neural networks, using
only so very few spikes to communicate. Building on recent insights in
neuroscience, we present an Adapting Spiking Neural Network (ASNN) based on
adaptive spiking neurons. These spiking neurons efficiently encode information
in spike-trains using a form of Asynchronous Pulsed Sigma-Delta coding while
homeostatically optimizing their firing rate. In the proposed paradigm of
spiking neuron computation, neural adaptation is tightly coupled to synaptic
plasticity, to ensure that downstream neurons can correctly decode upstream
spiking neurons. We show that this type of network is inherently able to carry
out asynchronous and event-driven neural computation, while performing
identical to corresponding artificial neural networks (ANNs). In particular, we
show that these adaptive spiking neurons can be drop in replacements for ReLU
neurons in standard feedforward ANNs comprised of such units. We demonstrate
that this can also be successfully applied to a ReLU based deep convolutional
neural network for classifying the MNIST dataset. The ASNN thus outperforms
current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) implementations, while responding (up
to) an order of magnitude faster and using an order of magnitude fewer spikes.
Additionally, in a streaming setting where frames are continuously classified,
we show that the ASNN requires substantially fewer network updates as compared

random networks, which avoid such a rescaling. The proposed models have an
extensive energy, which is however non-additive. For such long-range random

surface energy scales linearly with the network size, while for $\delta >1$ it
is $O(1)$. By performing numerical simulations, we show that a negative
specific heat region is present in the microcanonical ensemble of a Blume-Capel
model, in correspondence with a first-order phase transition in the canonical
one. This proves that ensemble inequivalence is a consequence of
$non$-$additivity$ rather than $non$-$extensivity$. Moreover, since a

hardware-based data compression within the memory hierarchy, including on-chip
caches, main memory, and both on-chip and off-chip interconnects. This new
approach is fast, simple, and effective in saving storage space. A key insight
in our approach is that access time (including decompression latency) is
critical in modern memory hierarchies. By combining inexpensive hardware
support with modest OS support, our holistic approach to compression achieves
substantial improvements in performance and energy efficiency across the memory
hierarchy. Using this new approach, we make several major contributions in this
thesis. First, we propose a new compression algorithm, Base-Delta-Immediate
Compression (BDI), that achieves high compression ratio with very low
compression/decompression latency. BDI exploits the existing low dynamic range
of values present in many cache lines to compress them to smaller sizes using
Base+Delta encoding. Second, we observe that the compressed size of a cache
block can be indicative of its reuse. We use this observation to develop a new
cache insertion policy for compressed caches, the Size-based Insertion Policy
(SIP), which uses the size of a compressed block as one of the metrics to
predict its potential future reuse. Third, we propose a new main memory
compression framework, Linearly Compressed Pages (LCP), that significantly
reduces the complexity and power cost of supporting main memory compression. We
demonstrate that any compression algorithm can be adapted to fit the
requirements of LCP, and that LCP can be efficiently integrated with the
existing cache compression designs, avoiding extra compression/decompression.

streaks from an image. Based on the deep convolutional neural network (CNN), we
directly learn the mapping relationship between rainy and clean image detail
layers from data. Because we do not possess the ground truth corresponding to
real-world rainy images, we synthesize images with rain for training. In
contrast to other common strategies that increase depth or breadth of the
network, we use image processing domain knowledge to modify the objective
function and improve deraining with a modestly-sized CNN. Specifically, we
train our DerainNet on the detail (high-pass) layer rather than in the image
domain. Though DerainNet is trained on synthetic data, we find that the learned
network translates very effectively to real-world images for testing. Moreover,
we augment the CNN framework with image enhancement to improve the visual
results. Compared with state-of-the-art single image de-raining methods, our
method has improved rain removal and much faster computation time after network
training.

optoelectronic devices due to many favorable properties such as a high carrier
mobility, field-effect, and a direct bandgap that can range from 0.3 eV in its
bulk crystalline form to 2 eV for a single atomic layer. The low bandgap energy
for bulk black phosphorus allows for direct transition photoabsorption that
enables detection of light out to mid-infrared frequencies. In this work we
characterize the room temperature optical response of a black phosphorus
photoconductive detector at wavelengths ranging from 1.56 $\mu$m to 3.75
$\mu$m. Pulsed autocorrelation measurements in the near-infrared regime reveal
a strong, sub-linear photocurrent nonlinearity with a response time of 1 ns,
indicating that gigahertz electrical bandwidth is feasible. Time resolved
photoconduction measurements covering near- and mid-infrared frequencies show a
fast 65 ps rise time, followed by a carrier relaxation with a time scale that
matches the intrinsic limit determined by autocorrelation. The sublinear
photoresponse is shown to be caused by a reduction in the carrier relaxation
time as more energy is absorbed in the black phosphorus flake and is well
described by a carrier recombination model that is nonlinear with excess
carrier density. The device exhibits a measured noise-equivalent power of 530
pW/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ which is the expected value for Johnson noise limited
performance. The fast and sensitive room temperature photoresponse demonstrates
that black phosphorus is a promising new material for mid-infrared

computational resources for image reconstruction through reduced memory
footprints and lighter computations per iteration, which is important for the
scalability of imaging methods to the big data setting of the next-generation
telescopes. This article sheds new light on dimensionality reduction from the
perspective of compressed sensing theory and studies its interplay with imaging
algorithms designed in the context of convex optimization. We propose a
post-gridding linear data embedding to the space spanned by the left singular
vectors of the measurement operator, providing a dimensionality reduction below
image size. This embedding preserves the null space of the measurement operator
and hence also its sampling properties as per compressed sensing theory. We
show that this can be approximated by first computing the dirty image and then
applying a weighted subsampled discrete Fourier transform to obtain the final
reduced data vector. This Fourier dimensionality reduction model ensures a fast
implementation of the full measurement operator, essential for any iterative
image reconstruction method. The proposed reduction also preserves the i.i.d.
Gaussian properties of the original measurement noise. For convex
optimization-based imaging algorithms, this is key to justify the use of the
standard L2-norm as the data fidelity term. Our simulations confirm that this
dimensionality reduction approach can be leveraged by convex optimization
algorithms with no loss in imaging quality relative to reconstructing the image
from the complete visibility data set. Reconstruction results in simulation
settings with no direction dependent effects or calibration errors show
promising performance of the proposed dimensionality reduction. MATLAB code
implementing the proposed reduction method is available on GitHub.

revolutionized data analysis, but requesting cloud resources often involves
complex decisions for consumers. Under the current pricing mechanisms, cloud
service providers offer several service options and charge consumers based on
the resources they use. Before they can decide which cloud resources to
request, consumers have to estimate the completion time and cost of their
computational tasks for different service options and possibly for different
service providers. This estimation is challenging even for expert cloud users.
We propose a new market-based framework for pricing computational tasks in the
cloud. Our framework introduces an agent between consumers and cloud providers.
The agent takes data and computational tasks from users, estimates time and
cost for evaluating the tasks, and returns to consumers contracts that specify
the price and completion time. Our framework can be applied directly to
existing cloud markets without altering the way cloud providers offer and price
services. In addition, it simplifies cloud use for consumers by allowing them
to compare contracts, rather than choose resources directly. We present design,
analytical, and algorithmic contributions focusing on pricing computation
contracts, analyzing their properties, and optimizing them in complex
workflows. We conduct an experimental evaluation of our market framework over a
real-world cloud service and demonstrate empirically that our market ensures
three key properties: competitiveness, fairness, and resilience. Finally, we

(MISO) Gaussian broadcast channel~(BC), in which channel state information
(CSI) is available at both the transmitter and the receivers. The flexible and
explicit design of a uniquely decomposable constellation group (UDCG) is
provided based on pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and rectangular quadrature
amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations. With this, a modulation division
(MD) transmission scheme is developed for the MISO BC. The proposed MD scheme
enables each receiver to uniquely and efficiently detect their desired signals
from the superposition of mutually interfering cochannel signals in the absence
of noise. In our design, the optimal transmitter beamforming problem is solved
in a closed-form for two-user MISO BC using max-min fairness as a design
criterion. Then, for a general case with more than two receivers, we develop a
user-grouping-based beamforming scheme, where the grouping method, beamforming
vector design and power allocation problems are addressed by using weighted
max-min fairness. It is shown that our proposed approach has a lower
probability of error compared with the zero-forcing (ZF) method when the
Hermitian angle between the two channel vectors is small in a two-user case. In
addition, simulation results also reveal that for the general channel model
with more than two users, our user-grouping-based scheme significantly
outperforms the ZF, time division (TD), minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and
signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) based techniques in moderate and high
SNR regimes when the number of users approaches to the number of base station
(BS) antennas and it degrades into the ZF scheme when the number of users is
far less than the number of BS antennas in Rayleigh fading channels.

(MT) channels by analyzing three different modulation techniques. The first
requires transmitter-receiver synchronization and is based on modulating
information on the release timing of information particles. The other two are
asynchronous and are based on modulating information on the relative time
between two consecutive releases of information particles using
indistinguishable or distinguishable particles. All modulation schemes result
in a system that relate the transmitted and the received signals through an
additive noise, which follows a stable distribution. As the common notion of
the variance of a signal is not suitable for defining the power of stable
distributed signals (due to infinite variance), we derive an expression for the
geometric power of a large class of stable distributions, and then use this
result to characterize the geometric signal-to-noise ratio (G-SNR) for each of
the modulation techniques. In addition, for binary communication, we derive the
optimal detection rules for each modulation technique. Numerical evaluations
indicate that the bit error rate (BER) is constant for a given G-SNR, and the
performance gain obtained by using synchronized communication is significant.
Yet, it is also shown that by using two distinguishable particles per bit
instead of one, the BER of the asynchronous technique can approach that of the
synchronous one.

strongly depends on the relative angle between the optical field and
quantization axis due to Dy's large tensor polarizability. This anisotropy
provides a wide, 22-GHz tunability of the tune-out frequency for linearly
polarized light, in contrast to Rb and Cs whose near-infrared tune-out
wavelengths do not exhibit large anisotropy. The measurements of the total
light shift are performed by measuring the contrast of multipulse Kapitza-Dirac

an extension of recent work on studentized permutation tests to the case of

bottleneck in the left deep prefrontal white matter involving projections
associated with ventral language pathways and thalamo-cortical projections has
recently been proposed as a source of semantic deficits after stroke. However,
the effects of damage to a priori identified white matter bottlenecks on
language function have not been directly investigated. Here, we first used
white matter atlases to identify the previously described white matter
bottlenecks in the posterior temporal and deep prefrontal white matter. We then
assessed the effects of damage to each region on measures of category fluency,
picture naming, and auditory semantic decision-making in 43 patients with
chronic aphasia. Damage to the posterior temporal bottleneck predicted deficits
on all language measures, while damage to the anterior bottleneck only
predicted deficits in category fluency. Importantly, the effects of damage to
the bottleneck regions were not attributable to lesion volume, lesion loads on
the tracts traversing the bottlenecks, or damage to nearby cortical language
areas. Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping and fiber tracking analyses
corroborated these findings. Together, our results provide strong support for
the proposal that spatially specific white matter damage affecting white matter
bottlenecks, particularly in the posterior temporal lobe, contribute to chronic
language deficits after left hemispheric stroke. Our results suggest that
damage to this area is likely to simultaneously disrupt signaling via the
simultaneous disruption of dorsal and ventral language processing streams.

concentrated radial distribution and thus higher mass estimate (over twice the
TO mass for these BSS systems), suggesting an origin involving triple or
multiple stellar systems. In contrast, the faint BSS are less concentrated,
with a radial distribution similar to the main sequence (MS) binaries, pointing
to the MS binaries as the likely progenitors of these BSS. Putting our data
together with available photometric data in the visible and using MESA
evolutionary models, we calculate the expected number of stars in each
evolutionary stage for the normal evolution of stars and the number of stars
coming from the evolution of BSS. The results indicate that BSS have a post-MS
evolution comparable to that of a normal star of the same mass and a MS BSS

restricting the per user degrees of freedom (puDoF) in the system to $1/2$. The
puDoF can be further restricted by the number of antennas at the MB. For $L_T

avoidance schemes. The increase in the connectivity of transmission layer
beyond $L_T=2$ limits the achievable puDoF using only zero-forcing schemes to
less than 1/2, even in the presence of large number of antennas at each MB but
the optimal puDoF can be achieved by making each message available at multiple
SBs. This is done by sending an appropriate linear combination to the SB to
zero-force interference at the intended user. The maximum per user DoF of 1/2

  We consider this issue for a particular model that includes spatially-varying
coefficients. To examine the accuracy of the VB approximation we derive
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) for this model and conduct simulation studies to
compare its performance with VB. As expected we find that the computation time
required for VB is considerably less than that for HMC. In settings involving a
high or moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) we find that the two approaches
produce very similar results suggesting that the VB approximation is useful in
this setting. On the other hand, when one considers a low SNR, substantial
differences are found, suggesting that the approximation may not be accurate in
such cases and we demonstrate that VB produces Bayes estimators with larger
mean squared error (MSE). A real application related to face perception is also
carried out. Overall, our work clarifies the usefulness of VB for the
spatiotemporal analysis of fMRI data, while also pointing out the limitation of
VB when the SNR is low and the utility of HMC in this case.

for the formation of supermassive black holes seeds, the first generation of
stars, and the epoch of reionization. This suppression can occur via
photodissociation of H2 (by ultraviolet Lyman-Werner [LW] photons) or by
photodetachment of H-, a precursor in H2 formation (by infrared [IR] photons).
Previous studies have typically adopted idealised spectra, with a blackbody or
a power-law shape, in modeling the chemistry of metal-free protogalaxies, and
utilised a single parameter, the critical UV flux, or Jcrit, to determine
whether H2-cooling is prevented. This can be misleading, and that independent
of the spectral shape, there is a critical curve in the (kLW , kH^- ) plane,
where kLW and kH^- are the H2-dissocation rates by LW and IR photons, which
determines whether a protogalaxy can cool below ~1000 Kelvin. We use a one-zone
model to follow the chemical and thermal evolution of gravitationally
collapsing protogalactic gas, to compute this critical curve, and provide an
accurate analytical fit for it. We improve on previous works by considering a
variety of more realistic Pop III or Pop II-type spectra from population
synthesis models and perform fully frequency-dependent calculations of the
H2-photodissociation rates for each spectrum. We compute the ratio kLW/kH^- for
each spectrum, as well as the minimum stellar mass M_star, for various IMFs and
metallicities, required to prevent cooling in a neighboring halo a distance d
away. We provide critical M_star/d2 values for suppression of H2-cooling, with

on their atmospheric elemental abundances, particularly O/H, C/H, and C/O
ratios. Recent studies suggest that elemental ratios could provide important
constraints on formation and migration mechanisms of giant exoplanets. A
fundamental assumption in such studies is that the chemical composition of the
planetary envelope represents the sum-total of compositions of the accreted gas
and solids during the formation history of the planet. We investigate the
efficiency with which accreted planetesimals ablate in a giant planetary
envelope thereby contributing to its composition rather than sinking to the
core. From considerations of aerodynamic drag causing `frictional ablation' and
the envelope temperature structure causing `thermal ablation', we compute mass
ablations for impacting planetesimals of radii 30 m to 1 km for different
compositions (ice to iron) and a wide range of velocities and impact angles,
assuming spherical symmetry. Icy impactors are fully ablated in the outer
envelope for a wide range of parameters. Even for Fe impactors substantial
ablation occurs in the envelope for a wide range of sizes and velocities. For
example, iron impactors of sizes below ~0.5 km and velocities above ~30 km/s
are found to ablate by ~60-80% within the outer envelope at pressures below
10^3 bar due to frictional ablation alone. For deeper pressures (~10^7 bar),
substantial ablation happens over a wider range of parameters. Therefore, our
exploratory study suggests that atmospheric abundances of volatile elements in
giant planets reflect their accretion history during formation.

probabilistic treatments based on Gaussian distributions, with applications
ranging from studies of neutron-star structure to tests of general relativity
and searches for nanosecond gravitational waves. As for other applications of
Gaussian distributions, outliers in timing measurements pose a significant
challenge to statistical inference, since they can bias the estimation of
timing and noise parameters, and affect reported parameter uncertainties. We
describe and demonstrate a practical end-to-end approach to perform Bayesian
inference of timing and noise parameters robustly in the presence of outliers,
and to identify these probabilistically. The method is fully consistent (i.e.,
outlier-ness probabilities vary in tune with the posterior distributions of the
timing and noise parameters), and it relies on the efficient sampling of the
hierarchical form of the pulsar-timing likelihood. Such sampling has recently
become possible with a ""no-U-turn"" Hamiltonian sampler coupled to a highly
customized reparametrization of the likelihood; this code is described
elsewhere, but it is already available online. We recommend our method as a
standard step in the preparation of pulsar-timing-array datasets: even if
statistical inference is not affected, follow-up studies of outlier candidates
can reveal unseen problems in radio observations and timing measurements;
furthermore, confidence in the results of gravitational-wave searches will only
benefit from stringent statistical evidence that datasets are clean and

gas, and infrared (IR) properties of these ETGs. The most CO-rich ATLAS-3D ETGs
have radio luminosities consistent with extrapolations from H_2-mass-derived
star formation rates from studies of late-type galaxies. These ETGs also follow
the radio-IR correlation. However, ETGs with lower molecular gas masses tend to
have less radio emission relative to their CO and IR emission compared to
spirals. The fraction of galaxies in our sample with high IR-radio ratios is
much higher than in previous studies, and cannot be explained by a systematic
underestimation of the radio luminosity due to the presence extended,
low-surface-brightness emission that was resolved-out in our VLA observations.
In addition, we find that the high IR-radio ratios tend to occur at low IR
luminosities, but are not associated with low dynamical mass or metallicity.
Thus, we have identified a population of ETGs that have a genuine shortfall of
radio emission relative to both their IR and molecular gas emission. A number
of mechanisms may conspire to cause this radio deficiency, including a
bottom-heavy stellar initial mass function, weak magnetic fields, a higher
prevalence of environmental effects compared to spirals and enhanced cosmic ray
losses.

Standard Model play a fundamental role in modern particle physics, but have not
been verified so far in nature. Here, we show that a SUSY gauge theory with
dynamical gauge bosons and fermionic gauginos emerges naturally at the
pair-density-wave (PDW) quantum phase transition on the surface of a correlated
topological insulator (TI) hosting three Dirac cones, such as the topological
Kondo insulator SmB$_6$. At the quantum tricritical point between the surface
Dirac semimetal and nematic PDW phases, three massless bosonic Cooper pair
fields emerge as the superpartners of three massless surface Dirac fermions.
The resulting low-energy effective theory is the supersymmetric XYZ model,
which is dual by mirror symmetry to $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quantum
electrodynamics (SQED) in 2+1 dimensions, providing a first example of emergent
supersymmetric gauge theory in condensed matter systems. Supersymmetry allows
us to determine exactly certain critical exponents and the optical conductivity
of the surface states at the strongly coupled tricritical point, which may be
measured in future experiments.

demonstrate that Impeded Dark Matter can be easily realized without requiring
tuning of model parameters. For negative mass splitting, we demonstrate that
the annihilation cross-section for Impeded Dark Matter depends linearly on the
dark matter velocity or may even be kinematically forbidden, making this
scenario almost insensitive to constraints from the cosmic microwave background

Impeded Dark Matter to yield observable signals in clusters or the Galactic
center, with no corresponding signal in dwarfs. For positive mass splitting, we
show that the annihilation cross-section is suppressed by the small mass
splitting, which helps light dark matter to survive increasingly stringent
constraints from indirect searches. As specific realizations for Impeded Dark
Matter, we introduce a model of vector dark matter from a hidden $SU(2)$
sector, and a composite dark matter scenario based on a QCD-like dark sector.

theoretical studies, which generally span a lower range of stellar masses than
earlier works. We also account for case-B departures and the stochastic
sampling of the IMF. In agreement with previous works, we find that departures
from case-B can enhance the Lya flux by a factor of a few, but we argue that
this enhancement is driven mainly by collisional excitation and ionization, and
not due to photoionization from the n = 2 state of atomic hydrogen. The
increased sensitivity of the Lya flux to the high-energy end of the galaxy
spectrum makes it more subject to stochastic sampling of the IMF. The latter
introduces a dispersion in the predicted nebular line fluxes around the
deterministic value by as much as a factor of ~4. In contrast, the stochastic
sampling of the IMF has less impact on the emerging Lyman Werner (LW) photon
flux. When case-B departures and stochasticity effects are combined, nebular
line emission from population III galaxies can be up to one order of magnitude
brighter than predicted by 'standard' calculations that do not include these
effects. This enhances the prospects for detection with future facilities such
as JWST and large, groundbased telescopes.

stripe ordered phase of LBCO, with detection of previously unobserved
('wiped-out') signal. We show that spin-spin and spin-lattice relaxation rates
are strongly enhanced in the charge ordered phase, explaining the apparent
signal decrease in earlier investigations. The enhancement is caused by
magnetic, rather than charge fluctuations, conclusively confirming the
long-suspected assumption that spin fluctuations are responsible for the
wipeout effect. Observation of the full Cu signal enables insight into the spin
and charge dynamics of the stripe-ordered phase, and measurements in external
magnetic fields provide information on the nature and suppression of spin
fluctuations associated with charge order. We find glassy spin dynamics, in
agreement with previous work, and incommensurate static charge order with
charge modulation amplitude similar to other cuprate compounds, suggesting that
the amplitude of charge stripes is universal in the cuprates.

the analogous relation between the transverse thermoelectric Peltier

current operator and the mixed nature of the thermoelectric response functions.
Remarkably, however, it appears that emergence of quasiparticles at low
temperatures forces alpha_{xy} = - alpha_{yx}. This suggests that
quasiparticle-free groundstates (so-called non-Fermi liquids) may be detected
by examining the relationship between alpha_{xy} and alpha_{yx} in the presence
of reflection symmetry and microscopic anisotropy. These conclusions are based
on the following results: (i) The relation between the Peltier coefficients is
exact for elastically scattered noninteracting particles; (ii) It holds
approximately within Boltzmann theory for interacting particles when elastic
scattering dominates over inelastic processes. In a disordered Fermi liquid the
latter lead to deviations that vanish as T^3. (iii) We calculate the
thermoelectric response in a model of weakly-coupled spin-gapped Luttinger
liquids and obtain strong breakdown of antisymmetry between the off-diagonal

control design as well as margin of robustness are obtained from solution to an
non-convex weight control problem. We establish relationship between feasible

an upper bound on the margin of robustness in terms of the min cut capacity.
This bound is proven to be tight if the network is tree-like, or if the lower
bound of the operation range of weight control is zero. An explicit expression
for the flow-weight Jacobian is derived and is used to devise a projected

replacing a sub-network by a (virtual) link with equivalent weight and

shown to possess a strong quasi-concavity property, facilitating easy solution
to the weight control problem. Robustness analysis for natural decentralized
control policies that decrease weights on overloaded links, and increase
weights on underloaded links with increasing flows is provided for parallel

central binary axis aligned with the primary axis of the nebula. Here we add
two more systems to the list, the central stars and nebulae of NGC 6337 and Sp
1. We show both systems to be low inclination, with their binary axis nearly
aligned with our line-of-sight. Their inclinations match published values for
the inclinations of their surrounding nebulae. Including these two systems with
the existing sample statistically demonstrates a direct link between the
central binary and the nebular morphology. In addition to the systems'
inclinations we give ranges for other orbital parameters from binary modeling,
including updated orbital periods for the binary central stars of NGC 6337 and
Sp 1.

using the Savage-Dickey Density Ratio (SDDR). In this way model selection
becomes a problem of parameter estimation. We consider two ways of constructing
the supermodel in detail: one based on combined models, and a second based on
combined likelihoods. We report on these two approaches for a Gaussian linear
model for which the Bayesian evidence can be calculated analytically and a toy
nonlinear problem. Unlike the combined model approach, where a standard Monte
Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) struggles, the combined-likelihood approach fares
much better in providing a reliable estimate of the log-Bayes Factor. This
scheme potentially opens the way to computationally efficient ways to compute
Bayes Factors in high dimensions that exploit the good scaling properties of
MCMC, as compared to methods such as nested sampling that fail for high

mediator could provide a portal between SM and hidden sector states, and we
also consider the possibility that the axial vector couples to dark matter. If
the dark matter relic density is set due to freeze-out via the axial vector,
this strongly constrains the parameter space.

measurements can yield values differing from each other by orders of magnitude.
Using low temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) to measure an

the tip position on that scale modifies the transition's barrier and attempt

the latter and entropy results in a single-molecular enthalpy-entropy

systems and new technology such as phase shifting transformers (PSTs) and high
voltage direct current connections (HVDC). Previous studies have shown that the
use of corrective control in response to outages contributes to a reduction in
operating cost, while maintaining N-1 security. In this work, we propose a
method to extend the use of corrective control of PSTs and HVDCs to react to
uncertainty. We characterize the uncertainty as continuous random variables,
and define the corrective control actions through affine control policies. This
allows us to efficiently model control reactions to a large number of
uncertainty sources. The control policies are then included in a chance
constrained optimal power flow formulation, which guarantees that the system
constraints are enforced with a desired probability. By applying an analytical
reformulation of the chance constraints, we obtain a second-order cone problem
for which we develop an efficient solution algorithm. In a case study for the
IEEE 118 bus system, we show that corrective control for uncertainty leads to a
decrease in operational cost, while maintaining system security. Further, we
demonstrate the scalability of the method by solving the problem for the IEEE

Because, in this scheme, stimulus identity depends on relative amplitudes of
stimulus features, identity becomes invariant with respect to variations in
intensity and monotonous non-linearities of neuronal responses. In the
olfactory system, stimulus identity can be represented by the identities of the
p strongest responding odorant receptor types out of a species dependent
complement. We show that this information is sufficient to recover sparse
stimuli (odorants) via elastic net loss minimization. Such a minimization has
to be performed under constraints imposed by the relationships between stimulus
features. We map this problem onto the dual problem of minimizing a functional
of Lagrange multipliers. The dual problem, in turn, can be solved by a neural
network whose Lyapunov function represents the dual Lagrangian. We thus propose
that networks in the piriform cortex compute odorant identity and implement
dual computations with the sparse activities of individual neurons representing

the quasi-simultaneous gamma-ray spectrum by a synchrotron self-Compton
component produced by an electron distribution with index p = 2.2. Assuming
that the power-law electron distribution extends down to the minimum electron
Lorentz factor gamma_min = 1 and that there is one proton per electron, an
unrealistically high total jet power L_p of roughly 10^47 erg/s is inferred.
This can be reduced by two orders of magnitude either by considering a
significant presence of electron-positron pairs with lepton-to-proton ratio of

energy distribution at the electron Lorentz factor gamma_br1 of roughly 100. In
either case, the jet composition is expected to be strongly matter-dominated.

information are a basic workhorse for many downstream applications in modern
data science. State of the art approaches have been either geometric (nearest
neighbor (NN) based) or kernel based (with a globally chosen bandwidth). In
this paper, we combine both these approaches to design new estimators of
entropy and mutual information that outperform state of the art methods. Our
estimator uses local bandwidth choices of $k$-NN distances with a finite $k$,
independent of the sample size. Such a local and data dependent choice improves
performance in practice, but the bandwidth is vanishing at a fast rate, leading
to a non-vanishing bias. We show that the asymptotic bias of the proposed
estimator is universal; it is independent of the underlying distribution.
Hence, it can be pre-computed and subtracted from the estimate. As a byproduct,
we obtain a unified way of obtaining both kernel and NN estimators. The
corresponding theoretical contribution relating the asymptotic geometry of
nearest neighbors to order statistics is of independent mathematical interest.

from an Eikonal equation via the fast sweeping method. The segmentation is then
realised by solving an ordinary differential equation with the geodesic
distance. The results of the GDM are compared with manually segmented retinal

recent years hints of the limits of standard classification have begun to

retrain learning models only for small changes to the original problem all
point to a potential shortcoming in the classic classification regime, where a
comprehensive a priori knowledge of the possible classes or concepts is
critical. Without such knowledge, classifiers misjudge the limits of their
knowledge and overgeneralization therefore becomes a serious obstacle to
consistent performance. In response to these challenges, this paper extends the
classic regime by reframing classification instead with the assumption that
concepts present in the training set are only a sample of the hypothetical

elaboration of standard architectures called the competitive overcomplete

effectiveness of COOL by applying it to fooling, separable concept learning,
one-class neural networks, and standard classification benchmarks. The results

problem of collisions, we adopt the successive interference cancellation (SIC)
algorithm to enable the coordinator to simultaneously communicate with multiple
devices, which is referred to as the multi-packet reception (MPR) capability.
However, the MPR capability could be fully utilized only when random access
algorithms are properly designed. Considering the characteristics of the SIC
aided random access VLC system, we propose a novel effective capacity
(EC)-based ALOHA-like distributed random access algorithm for MPR-aided uplink
VLC systems having heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. Firstly,
we model the VLC network as a conflict graph and derive the EC for each device.
Then, we formulate the VLC QoS-guaranteed random access problem as a saturation
throughput maximization problem subject to multiple statistical QoS
constraints. Finally, the resultant non-concave optimization problem (OP) is
solved by a memetic search algorithm relying on invasive weed optimization and
differential evolution (IWO-DE). We demonstrate that our derived EC expression
matches the Monte Carlo simulation results accurately, and the performance of
our proposed algorithms is competitive.

learn from their lifetime experience. By contrast, artificial neural networks
trained with backpropagation generally have fixed connection weights that do
not change once training is complete. While recent methods can endow neural
networks with long-term memories, Hebbian plasticity is currently not amenable
to gradient descent. Here we derive analytical expressions for activity
gradients in neural networks with Hebbian plastic connections. Using these
expressions, we can use backpropagation to train not just the baseline weights
of the connections, but also their plasticity. As a result, the networks ""learn
how to learn"" in order to solve the problem at hand: the trained networks
automatically perform fast learning of unpredictable environmental features
during their lifetime, expanding the range of solvable problems. We test the
algorithm on various on-line learning tasks, including pattern completion,
one-shot learning, and reversal learning. The algorithm successfully learns how
to learn the relevant associations from one-shot instruction, and fine-tunes
the temporal dynamics of plasticity to allow for continual learning in response
to changing environmental parameters. We conclude that backpropagation of
Hebbian plasticity offers a powerful model for lifelong learning.

brightest compact binary MSP in the optical band (r'$\simeq$14.3 mag) and will
have the longest orbital period among Galactic field systems (nearly 21 hr).

a galaxy group, with redshift $z=0.0509 \pm 0.0021$ is passing through the

detection. Here, we consider the bipartite entanglement generated by coherently
distributing $M$ photons in $M$ modes to two separate locations, where linear
optics and photon detection is used to verify the non-classical correlations
between the two $M$-mode systems. We show that the entangled state is symmetric
under mode shift operations performed in the two systems and use this symmetry
to derive correlations between photon number distributions detected after a
discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the modes. The experimentally observable
correlations can be explained by a simple and intuitive rule that relates the
sum of the output mode indices to the eigenvalue of the input state under the
mode shift operation. Since the photon number operators after the DFT do not
commute with the initial photon number operators, entanglement is necessary to
achieve strong correlations in both the initial mode photon numbers and the
photon numbers observed after the DFT. We can therefore derive entanglement
witnesses based on the experimentally observable correlations in both photon
number distributions, providing a practical criterion for the evaluation of
large scale entanglement in optical multi-mode systems. Our method thus
demonstrates how non-classical signatures in large scale optical quantum
circuits can be accessed experimentally by choosing an appropriate combination
of modes in which to detect the photon number distributions that characterize
the quantum coherences of the state.

found that the minimization over the entire space can be partitioned into
several interconnected minimizations within the individual nodal regions, and

black holes are realized on patches that experienced more Hubble expansion than
the others. By making these patches the minor component, the rarity of
supermassive black holes can be explained. On the other hand, most regions of

almost-scale-invariant adiabatic perturbations confirmed by observations of CMB

disparity of wavelengths of EM waves and that of electron waves, a numerical

Schrodinger equation. Finally, Maxwell's equations represented by the vector
potential with a Coulomb gauge, together with the ODEs, are solved
self-consistently. For numerical examples, the interaction between EM fields
and a particle is investigated for both the closed, open and inhomogeneous
electromagnetic systems. The proposed approach not only captures the Rabi
oscillation phenomenon in the closed cavity but also captures the effects of
radiative decay and shift in the open free space. After comparing with the
existing theoretical approximate models, it is found that the approximate
models break down in certain cases where a rigorous self-consistent approach is
needed. This work is helpful for the EM simulation of emerging nanodevices or
next-generation quantum electrodynamic systems.

multisinusoidal signal from a finite number of samples, some of which may be
completely corrupted. Measurements of this form can be modeled as an additive
mixture of a sinusoidal and a sparse component. We propose to demix the two
components and super-resolve the spectrum of the multisinusoidal signal by
solving a convex program. Our main theoretical result is that-- up to
logarithmic factors-- this approach is guaranteed to be successful with high
probability for a number of spectral lines that is linear in the number of
measurements, even if a constant fraction of the data are outliers. The result
holds under the assumption that the phases of the sinusoidal and sparse

condition. We show that the method can be implemented via semidefinite
programming and explain how to adapt it in the presence of dense perturbations,
as well as exploring its connection to atomic-norm denoising. In addition, we
propose a fast greedy demixing method which provides good empirical results
when coupled with a local nonconvex-optimization step.

distribution of the rotation frequency in the bulge region is not monotonic in
general. The amplification of the magnetic field is enhanced in regions with
stronger differential rotation, because magnetorotational instability and
field-line stretching are more effective. The strength of the amplified
magnetic field reaches >~ 0.5 mG, and radial flows of the gas are excited by
the inhomogeneous transport of angular momentum through turbulent magnetic
field that is amplified in a spatially dependent manner. As a result, the
simulated position-velocity diagram exhibits a time-dependent asymmetric
parallelogram-shape owing to the intermittency of the magnetic turbulence; the
present model provides a viable alternative to the bar-potential-driven model
for the parallelogram shape of the central molecular zone. In addition, Parker
instability (magnetic buoyancy) creates vertical magnetic structure, which
would correspond to observed molecular loops, and frequently excited vertical
flows. Furthermore, the time-averaged net gas flow is directed outward, whereas
the flows are highly time dependent, which would contribute to the outflow from
the bulge.

there are significantly varying treatment responses across people with MS

novel method to cluster pwMS according to the sequence of DMT prescriptions and
associated clinical features (covariates). This is achieved via a mixture
Markov chain analysis with covariates, where the sequence of prescribed DMTs

challenges to maximize the mixture likelihood on the constrained parameter
space, we develop a pattern search-based global optimization technique which
can optimize any objective function on a collection of simplexes and shown to
outperform other related global optimization techniques. In simulation

Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm based method for clustering sequence

clusters: inferon-beta dominated, multi-DMTs, and natalizumab dominated.
Further cluster-specific summaries of relevant covariates indicate patient
differences among the clusters. This method may guide the DMT prescription

confirms that the source of GLE63 was associated with an event in active region
9742 that comprised two flares. The first flare (04:30-05:03 UT) reached a GOES
importance of about M1.6. Two microwave sources were observed, whose brightness
temperatures at 5.7 GHz exceeded 10 MK. The main flare, up to the M7.1
importance, started at 05:04 UT, and occurred in strong magnetic fields. The
observed microwave sources reached about 250 MK. They were not static. Having
appeared on the weaker-field periphery of the active region, the microwave
sources moved toward each other nearly along the magnetic neutral line,
approaching a stronger-field core of the active region, and then moved away
from the neutral line like expanding ribbons. These motions rule out an
association of the non-thermal microwave sources with a single flaring loop.

such chains must appear in families whose size is larger than the corresponding
extremal result.
  This question was resolved for $2$-chains by Kleitman in $1966$, who showed
that amongst families of size $M$ in $\mathcal{P}(n)$, the number of $2$-chains
is minimized by a family whose sets are taken as close to the middle layer as
possible. He also conjectured that the same conclusion should hold for all $k$,
not just $2$. The best result on this question is due to Das, Gan and Sudakov
who showed that Kleitman's conjecture holds for families whose size is at most
the size of the $k+1$ middle layers of $\mathcal{P}(n)$, provided $k\leq n-6$.
Our main result is that for every fixed $k$ and $\epsilon>0$, if $n$ is
sufficiently large then Kleitman's conjecture holds for families of size at
most $(1-\epsilon)2^n$, thereby establishing Kleitman's conjecture
asymptotically. Our proof is based on ideas of Kleitman and Das, Gan and

levels of intrinsic scatter that make these relations viable as competitive

of open cluster CBs, we require that (i) the CB of interest must be located
inside the core radius of its host cluster; (ii) the CB's proper motion must be
located within the $2\sigma$ distribution of that of its host open cluster; and
(iii) the CB's age, $t$, must be comparable to that of its host cluster, i.e.,
$\Delta \log (t\mbox{ yr}^{-1}) <0.3$. We thus select a calibration sample of
66 CBs with either open cluster distances or accurate space-based parallaxes.
The resulting near-infrared PL relations, for both late-type (i.e., W Ursae
Majoris-type) and---for the first time---early-type CBs, are as accurate as the
well-established $JHK_{\rm s}$ Cepheid PL relations, (characterized by
single-band statistical uncertainties of $\sigma < 0.10$ mag). We show that CBs
can be used as viable distance tracers, yielding distances with uncertainties
of better than 5\% for 90\% of the 6090 CBs in our full sample. By combining
the full $JHK_{\rm s}$ photometric data set, CBs can trace distances with an
accuracy, $\sigma=0.05 \mbox{ (statistical)} \pm0.03 \mbox{ (systematic)}$ mag.

relatively bright at radio wavelength, but unusually faint at infrared (IR) and
optical wavelengths. A recent and extensive campaign on the radio-brightest
IFRSs (S_{1.4GHz} >= 10 mJy) has provided evidence that most of them (if not
all) contain an AGN. Still uncertain is the nature of the radio-faintest ones
(S_{1.4GHz} <= 1 mJy). The scope of this paper is to assess the nature of the
radio-faintest IFRSs, testing their classification and improving the knowledge
of their IR properties making use of the most sensitive IR survey available so
far: the Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (SERVS). We also
explore how the criteria of IFRSs can be fine-tuned to pinpoint radio-loud AGNs
at very high redshift (z > 4). We analysed a number of IFRS samples identified
in SERVS fields, including a new sample (21 sources) extracted from the Lockman
Hole. 3.6 and 4.5 mum IR counterparts of the 64 sources located in the SERVS
fields were searched for, and, when detected, their IR properties were studied.
We compared the radio/IR properties of the IR-detected IFRSs with those
expected for a number of known classes of objects. We found that they are
mostly consistent with a mixture of high-redshift (z >= 3) radio-loud AGNs. The
faintest ones (S_{1.4GHz} ~ 100 muJy), however, could be also associated with
nearer (z ~ 2) dust-enshrouded star-burst galaxies. We also argue that, while
IFRSs with radio-to-IR ratios > 500 can very efficiently pinpoint radio-loud
AGNs at redshift 2 < z < 4, lower radio-to-IR ratios (~ 100--200) are expected
for higher redshift radio-loud AGNs.

typically defined as the task of finding a rigid transformation (i.e., 3DOF
rotation/translation on the 2D moving plane) that aligns the query and
reference maps built by mobile robots. This definition is valid in loop-rich
trajectories that enable a mapper robot to close many loops, for which precise
maps can be assumed. The same cannot be said about the newly emerging
autonomous navigation and driving systems, which typically operate in loop-less
trajectories that have no large loop (e.g., straight paths). In this paper, we
propose a solution that overcomes this limitation by merging the two maps. Our
study is motivated by the observation that even when there is no large loop in
either the query or reference map, many loops can often be obtained in the
merged map. We add two new aspects to map matching: (1) image retrieval with
discriminative deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) features, which
efficiently generates a small number of good initial alignment hypotheses; and
(2) map merge, which jointly deforms the two maps to minimize differences in
shape between them. To realize practical computation time, we also present a
preemption scheme that avoids excessive evaluation of useless map-matching
hypotheses. To verify our approach experimentally, we created a novel
collection of uncertain loop-less maps by utilizing the recently published
North Campus Long-Term (NCLT) dataset and its ground-truth GPS data. The
results obtained using these map collections confirm that our approach improves
on previous map-matching approaches.

sensitive to the chemical evolution processes at early time, and it is an
indicator of star formation timescale ($\tau_{{\rm SF}}$). Although the
physical reason remains ambiguous, there is a tight relation between
[$\alpha$/Fe] and stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) among massive
early-type galaxies (ETGs). However, no work has shown convincing results as to
how this relation behaves at low masses. We assemble 15 data sets from the
literature and build a large sample that includes 192 nearby low-mass
($18<\sigma<80$~\kms) ETGs. We find that the [$\alpha$/Fe]-$\sigma$ relation
generally holds for low-mass ETGs, except in extreme environments.
Specifically, in normal galaxy cluster environments, the [$\alpha$/Fe]-$\sigma$
relation and its intrinsic scatter are, within uncertainties, similar for
low-mass and high-mass ETGs. However, in the most massive relaxed galaxy
cluster in our sample, the zero point of the relation is higher and the
intrinsic scatter is significantly larger. By contrast, in galaxy groups the
zero point of the relation offsets in the opposite direction, again with
substantial intrinsic scatter. The elevated [$\alpha$/Fe] of low-mass ETGs in
the densest environments suggests that their star formation was quenched
earlier than in high-mass ETGs. For the low-mass ETGs in the lowest density
environments, we suggest that their more extended star formation histories
suppressed their average [$\alpha$/Fe]. The large scatter in [$\alpha$/Fe] may
reflect stochasticity in the chemical evolution of low-mass galaxies.

categories in such datasets are pre-defined and vocabularies are fixed. However
humans may describe the same action with different phrases, which leads to the
difficulty of vocabulary expansion for traditional fully-supervised methods. We
observe that large amounts of images with sentence descriptions are readily
available on the Internet. The sentence descriptions can be regarded as weak
labels for the images, which contain rich information and could be used to
learn flexible expressions of action categories. We propose a method to learn
an Action Concept Tree (ACT) and an Action Semantic Alignment (ASA) model for
classification from image-description data via a two-stage learning process. A
new dataset for the task of learning actions from descriptions is built.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms several baseline methods
significantly.

The external driving force arises from the combined optical tweezer and

NUV fraction is a factor of $\sim2$ lower for satellite galaxies between
$10^{10.5}M_{\bigodot}$ and $10^{10.7}M_{\bigodot}$, showing that higher mass
galaxies are more able to form stars when not influenced by a group potential.
There was a higher (NUV $- r$) blue fraction of galaxies with lower Sersic
indices (n < 3) outside of groups, not seen in the satellite sample. We have
used stellar population models of Bruzual & Charlot (2003) with multiple burst,

decay of star formation, compared to the satellite galaxies. We suggest that
taken together, the difference in (NUV $- r$) colours between samples can be
explained by a population of secularly evolving, non-grouped galaxies, where

syndrome (MBS) research. Both exploration- and confirmation-driven factor
analyzes are rampant. However, factor analytic results on MBS differ widely. A
situation that is at least in part attributable to misapplication of FA. Here,
our purpose is (i) to review factor analytic efforts in the study of MBS with
emphasis on misusage of the FA model and (ii) to propose an alternative factor
analytic strategy.
  Methods: The proposed factor analytic strategy consists of four steps and
confronts weaknesses in application of the FA model. At its heart lies the
explicit separation of dimensionality and pattern selection as well as the
direct evaluation of competing inequality-constrained loading patterns. A
high-profile MBS data set with anthropometric measurements on overweight
children and adolescents is reanalyzed using this strategy.
  Results: The reanalysis implied a more parsimonious constellation of
pathophysiological domains underlying phenotypic expressions of MBS than the
original analysis (and many other analyzes). The results emphasize correlated
factors of impaired glucose metabolism and impaired lipid metabolism.
  Conclusions: Pathophysiological domains underlying phenotypic expressions of
MBS included in the analysis are driven by multiple interrelated metabolic
impairments. These findings indirectly point to the possible existence of a
multifactorial aetiology.

branch (AGB) stars. However, there is increasing evidence today for dust
formation in supernovae (SNe). To establish the relative importance of these
two classes of stellar sources of dust, it is important to know the fraction of
freshly formed dust in SN ejecta that is able to survive the passage of the
reverse shock and be injected in the interstellar medium. We have developed a
new code (GRASH\_Rev) which follows the newly-formed dust evolution throughout
the supernova explosion until the merging of the forward shock with the
circumstellar ISM. We have considered four well studied SNe in the Milky Way
and Large Magellanic Cloud: SN1987A, CasA, the Crab Nebula, and N49. For all
the simulated models, we find good agreement with observations and estimate
that between 1 and 8$\%$ of the observed mass will survive, leading to a SN
dust production rate of $(3.9 \pm 3.7) \times 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ in
the Milky Way. This value is one order of magnitude larger than the dust
production rate by AGB stars but insufficient to counterbalance the dust
destruction by SNe, therefore requiring dust accretion in the gas phase.

model and a quantum routing protocol with multi-hop teleportation for wireless
mesh backbone networks. Based on an analysis of quantum multi-hop protocols, a
partially entangled Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger (GHZ) state is selected as
the quantum channel for the proposed protocol. Both quantum and classical
wireless channels exist between two neighboring nodes along the route. With the
proposed routing protocol, quantum information can be transmitted hop by hop
from the source node to the destination node. Based on multi-hop teleportation
based on the partially entangled GHZ state, a quantum route established with
the minimum number of hops. The difference between our routing protocol and the
classical one is that in the former, the processes used to find a quantum route
and establish quantum channel entanglement occur simultaneously. The Bell state
measurement results of each hop are piggybacked to quantum route finding
information. This method reduces the total number of packets and the magnitude
of air interface delay. The deduction of the establishment of a quantum channel
between source and destination is also presented here. The final success
probability of quantum multi-hop teleportation in wireless mesh backbone
networks was simulated and analyzed. Our research shows that quantum multi-hop

remarkable momentum before the crisis appearance, but it has slightly slowed

new trade theory suggest that FDI influence the trade intensity but the studies
approaching this relationship for the CEE countries present mixed evidence, and
investigate the commercial integration of CEE countries with the old EU
members. Against this background, the purpose of this paper is to assess the
CEE countries' intra-integration, focusing on the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Poland and the Slovak Republic. For each country we employ a panel
gravitational model for the bilateral trade and FDI, considering its
interactions with the other three countries in the sample on the one hand, and
with the three EU main commercial partners on the other hand. We investigate
different facets of the trade -- FDI nexus, resorting to a fixed effects model,
a random effects model, as well as to an instrumental variable estimator, over
the period 2000-2013. Our results suggest that outward FDI sustains the CEE
countries' commercial integration, while inward FDI has no significant effect.
In all the cases a complementarity effect between trade and FDI is documented,
which is stronger for the CEE countries' historical trade partners.
Consequently, these findings show that CEE countries' policymakers are
interested in encouraging the outward FDI toward their neighbour countries in
order to increase the commercial integration.

astrophysicaly motivated range of rotation profiles, we investigate the
characteristics of neutron stars with maximal mass for all types of families of
differentially rotating relativistic objects identified in a previous article

on both the degree of differential rotation and on the type of solution. It
turns out that the maximum allowed mass can be up to 4 times higher than what
it is for non-rotating stars with the same equation of state. Such values are
obtained for a modest degree of differential rotation but for one of the newly
discovered type of solutions. Since such configurations of stars are not that
extreme, this result may have important consequences for the gravitational wave
signal to expect from coalescing neutron star binaries or from some supernovae

regions with and without adsorbed oxygen and that these boundary states
generically constitute simple linear connections between valence and conduction

models depends on the topology of the network on which the model is defined. It
has been shown that cycles in meshed networks play a crucial role in
determining $\mathcal{N}$, because any two different stable fixed points differ
by a collection of loop flows on those cycles. Since the number of different
loop flows increases with the length of the cycle that carries them, one
expects $\mathcal{N}$ to be larger in meshed networks with longer cycles.
Simultaneously, the existence of more cycles in a network means more freedom to
choose the location of loop flows differentiating between two stable fixed
points. Therefore, $\mathcal{N}$ should also be larger in networks with more
cycles. We derive an algebraic upper bound for the number of stable fixed
points of the Kuramoto model with identical frequencies, under the assumption
that angle differences between connected nodes do not exceed $\pi/2$. We obtain
$\mathcal{N}\leq\prod_{k=1}^c\left[2\cdot{\rm Int}(n_k/4)+1\right]$, which
depends both on the number $c$ of cycles and on the spectrum of their lengths
$\{n_k\}$. We further identify network topologies carrying stable fixed points
with angle differences larger than $\pi/2$, which leads us to conjecture an
upper bound for the number of stable fixed points for Kuramoto models on any

bounds in the total number of vertices, our bounds are much lower and therefore
much closer to the true number of stable fixed points.

still nowadays the Fowler-Nordheim and the Richardson-Laue-Dushman equations

nanometrically sharp emitters or in the intermediate thermal-field regime. In
this paper we develop a computational method for the calculation of emission
currents and Nottingham heat, which automatically distinguishes among different
emission regimes, and implements the appropriate calculation method for each.
Our method covers all electron emission regimes (thermal, field and
intermediate), aiming to maximize the calculation accuracy while minimizing the
computational time. As an example, we implemented it in atomistic simulations
of the thermal evolution of Cu nanotips under strong electric fields and found
that the predicted behaviour of such nanotips by the developed technique

consists of two sources that are separated by ~1.5 kpc, indicating a mid-stage
merger. The peak star formation rate densities in the central clumps are ~300 -
3000 Msun/yr/kpc^2, suggesting regions with extreme star formation near the
Eddington Limit. By comparing the flux obtained by ALMA and Submillimeter Array

the extended 3 - 4 kpc region. Overall, the data presented here suggest that
the luminosity surface densities observed at < 150 pc scales are roughly
similar to that observed in local ULIRGs, as in the eastern nucleus of Arp 220.
Between 10 to 30% of the 860 micron continuum is concentrated in clumpy

by a rapid inflow of gas such as a merger of gas-rich galaxies, surrounded by
extended and clumpy starbursts. However, the cold mode accretion model is not

of the LHC. The trigger system consists of two levels designed to select events
of potential physics interest from a GHz (MHz) interaction rate of
proton-proton (heavy ion) collisions. The first level of the trigger is
implemented in hardware, and selects events containing detector signals
consistent with an electron, photon, muon, tau lepton, jet, or missing
transverse energy. A programmable menu of up to 128 object-based algorithms is
used to select events for subsequent processing. The trigger thresholds are
adjusted to the LHC instantaneous luminosity during data taking in order to
restrict the output rate to 100 kHz, the upper limit imposed by the CMS readout
electronics. The second level, implemented in software, further refines the
purity of the output stream, selecting an average rate of 400 Hz for offline
event storage. The objectives, strategy and performance of the trigger system
during the LHC Run 1 are described.

  II: Three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations","16 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stw2164",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We explore the possibility of the formation of globular clusters under
ultraviolet (UV) background radiation. One-dimensional spherical symmetric
radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations by Hasegawa et al. have demonstrated
that the collapse of low-mass (10^6-10^7 solar masses) gas clouds exposed to
intense UV radiation can lead to the formation of compact star clusters like
globular clusters (GCs) if gas clouds contract with supersonic infall
velocities. However, three-dimensional effects, such as the anisotropy of
background radiation and the inhomogeneity in gas clouds, have not been studied
so far. In this paper, we perform three-dimensional RHD simulations in a
semi-cosmological context, and reconsider the formation of compact star
clusters in strong UV radiation fields. As a result, we find that although
anisotropic radiation fields bring an elongated shadow of neutral gas, almost
spherical compact star clusters can be procreated from a ""supersonic infall""
cloud, since photo-dissociating radiation suppresses the formation of hydrogen
molecules in the shadowed regions and the regions are compressed by UV heated
ambient gas. The properties of resultant star clusters match those of GCs. On
the other hand, in weak UV radiation fields, dark matter-dominated star
clusters with low stellar density form due to the self-shielding effect as well
as the positive feedback by ionizing photons. Thus, we conclude that the
""supersonic infall"" under a strong UV background is a potential mechanism to
form GCs.

stochastic tail exponent, the exponent $\alpha$ having its own distribution. We
show the effect of stochasticity of $\alpha$ on the expectation and higher
moments of the random variable. For instance, the moments of a right-tailed or
right-asymmetric variable, when finite, increase with the variance of $\alpha$;
those of a left-asymmetric one decreases. The same applies to conditional
shortfall (CVar), or mean-excess functions. We prove the general case and
examine the specific situation of lognormally distributed $\alpha \in
[b,\infty), b>1$. The stochasticity of the exponent induces a significant bias
in the estimation of the mean and higher moments in the presence of data
uncertainty. This has consequences on sampling error as uncertainty about
$\alpha$ translates into a higher expected mean. The bias is conserved under
summation, even upon large enough a number of summands to warrant convergence
to the stable distribution. We establish inequalities related to the asymmetry.
We also consider the situation of capped power laws (i.e. with compact
support), and apply it to the study of violence by Cirillo and Taleb (2016). We
show that uncertainty concerning the historical data increases the true mean.

for metrics for which the image of the Schouten tensor is invariant under

as a simplified analogue of many astrophysical and geophysical fluid flows.
Here, we use three-dimensional direct numerical simulations to study this
physical process. We construct a dataset of more than 200 numerical models that
cover a broad parameter range with Ekman numbers spanning $3\times 10^{-7} \leq
E \leq 10^{-1}$, Rayleigh numbers within the range $10^3 < Ra < 2\times
10^{10}$ and a Prandtl number unity. We investigate the scaling behaviours of
both local (length scales, boundary layers) and global (Nusselt and Reynolds
numbers) properties across various physical regimes from onset of rotating
convection to weakly-rotating convection. Close to critical, the convective
flow is dominated by a triple force balance between viscosity, Coriolis force
and buoyancy. For larger supercriticalities, a subset of our numerical data
approaches the asymptotic diffusivity-free scaling of rotating convection
$Nu\sim Ra^{3/2}E^{2}$ in a narrow fraction of the parameter space delimited by
$6\,Ra_c \leq Ra \leq 0.4\,E^{-8/5}$. Using a decomposition of the viscous
dissipation rate into bulk and boundary layer contributions, we establish a
theoretical scaling of the flow velocity that accurately describes the
numerical data. In rapidly-rotating turbulent convection, the fluid bulk is
controlled by a triple force balance between Coriolis, inertia and buoyancy,
while the remaining fraction of the dissipation can be attributed to the
viscous friction in the Ekman layers. Beyond $Ra \simeq E^{-8/5}$, the
rotational constraint on the convective flow is gradually lost and the flow
properties vary to match the regime changes between rotation-dominated and
non-rotating convection. The quantity $Ra E^{12/7}$ provides an accurate
transition parameter to separate rotating and non-rotating convection.

accurate detection of lesion region, i.e. segmentation of an image into two
regions as lesion and normal skin. Accurate segmentation can be challenging due
to burdens such as illumination variation and low contrast between lesion and
healthy skin. In this paper, a method based on deep neural networks is proposed
for accurate extraction of a lesion region. The input image is preprocessed and
then its patches are fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN). Local texture
and global structure of the patches are processed in order to assign pixels to
lesion or normal classes. A method for effective selection of training patches
is used for more accurate detection of a lesion border. The output segmentation

terrestrial networks will always be available. Unfortunately, in worst case
scenarios, infrastructures might get damaged totally or might be destroyed by
subsequent disasters. As a result, adequate guarantees can only be possible in
the hypothesis of very high financial involvement. Fortunately, considering
availability, coverage ubiquity and reliability, satellite technologies have
lately proven good. So, to maximize the high channel performance of terrestrial
networks and the availability and reliability of non-terrestrial networks, the
solution lies in a hybrid system. It is on this ground that this work deals
with the integration of LTE and satellite networks in both infrastructure-based

people trapped in disaster and field operators with a transparent accessibility

(XMCD), and angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) spectroscopies. The Ce $M_{4,
5}$ XAS spectra show very small satellite structures, reflecting a strongly
localized character of the Ce $4f$ electrons. The linear dichroism effects in
the Ce $M_{4, 5}$ XAS spectra demonstrate the ground state Ce $4f$ symmetry of
$\Gamma{_6}$, the spatial distribution of which is directed along the $c$-axis.
The XMCD results give support to the picture of local-moment magnetism in
CeAgSb$_2$. Moreover it is also found that the theoretical band dispersions for
LaAgSb$_2$ provides better description of the ARPES band structures than those
for CeAgSb$_2$. Nevertheless, ARPES spectra at the Ce $3d$-$4f$ resonance show
the momentum dependence for the intensity ratio between Ce $4f^{1}_{5/2}$ and
$4f^{1}_{7/2}$ peaks in a part of the Brillouin zone, suggesting the
non-negligible momentum dependent hybridization effect between the Ce $4f$ and
the conduction electrons. This is associated with the moderate mass enhancement
in CeAgSb$_2$.

has so far been proven to be elusive. However, there are a number of scenarios
which could lead to quasi-periodic variations in blazar light curves. For
example, orbital or thermal/viscous period of accreting matter around central
supermassive black holes could, in principle, be imprinted in the
multi-wavelength emission of small-scale blazar jets, carrying as such crucial
information about plasma conditions within the jet launching regions. In this
paper, we present the results of our time series analysis of $\sim 9.2$
year-long, and exceptionally well-sampled optical light curve of the BL Lac OJ
287. The study primarily uses the data from our own observations performed at
the Mt. Suhora and Krak\'ow Observatories in Poland, and at the Athens
Observatory in Greece. Additionally, SMARTS observations were used to fill in
some of the gaps in the data. The Lomb-Scargle Periodogram and the Weighted
Wavelet Z-transform methods were employed to search for the possible QPOs in
the resulting optical light curve of the source. Both the methods consistently
yielded possible quasi-periodic signal around the periods of $\sim 400$ and
$\sim 800$ days, the former one with a significance (over the underlying
colored noise) of $\geq 99\%$. A number of likely explanations for such are
discussed, with a preference given to a modulation of the jet production
efficiency by highly magnetized accretion disks. This supports the previous
findings and the interpretation reported recently in the literature for OJ 287
and other blazar sources.

  Systems",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video on Demand (VoD) services like Netflix and YouTube account for ever
increasing fractions of Internet traffic. It is estimated that this fraction
will cross 80% in the next three years. Most popular VoD services have
recommendation engines which recommend videos to users based on their viewing
history, thus introducing time-correlation in user requests. Understanding and
modeling this time-correlation in user requests is critical for network traffic
engineering. The primary goal of this work is to use empirically observed
properties of user requests to model the effect of recommendation engines on
the request patterns in VoD services. We propose a Markovian request model to
capture the time-correlation in user requests and show that our model is
consistent with the observations of existing empirical studies.
  Most large-scale VoD services deliver content to users via a distributed
network of servers as serving users requests via geographically co-located
servers reduces latency and network bandwidth consumption. The content
replication policy, i.e., determining which contents to cache on the servers is
a key resource allocation problem for VoD services. Recent studies show that
low start-up delay is a key Quality of Service (QoS) requirement of users of
VoD services. This motivates the need to pre-fetch (fetch before contents are
requested) and cache content likely to be request in the near future. Since
pre-fetching leads to an increase in the network bandwidth usage, we use our
Markovian model to explore the trade-offs and feasibility of implementing
recommendation based pre-fetching.

conservation laws and has received much interest. However, continuity in time
is often assumed and only semidiscrete stability is studied. Thus, it is
interesting to investigate the influence of explicit and implicit time
integration methods on the stability of numerical schemes. If an explicit time
integration method is applied, spacially stable numerical schemes for
hyperbolic conservation laws can result in unstable fully discrete schemes.
Focusing on the explicit Euler method (and convex combinations thereof),
undesired terms in the energy balance trigger this phenomenon and introduce an
erroneous growth of the energy over time. In this work, we study the influence
of artificial dissipation and modal filtering in the context of discontinuous
spectral element methods to remedy these issues. In particular, lower bounds on
the strength of both artificial dissipation and modal filtering operators are
given and an adaptive procedure to conserve the (discrete) $\mathbf{L}_2$ norm
of the numerical solution in time is derived. This might be beneficial in
regions where the solution is smooth and for long time simulations. Moreover,
this approach is used to study the connections between explicit and implicit
time integration methods and the associated energy production. By adjusting the
adaptive procedure, we demonstrate that filtering in explicit time integration
methods is able to mimic the dissipative behavior inherent in implicit time
integration methods. This contribution leads to a better understanding of
existing algorithms and numerical techniques, in particular the application of
artificial dissipation as well as modal filtering in the context of numerical
methods for hyperbolic conservation laws together with the selection of

massive and made of 90-95% of water ice. In contrast, the much less massive
rings of Uranus and Neptune are dark and likely to have higher rock fraction.
Here we investigate, for the first time, the tidal disruption of a passing
object, including the subsequent formation of planetary rings. First, we
perform SPH simulations of the tidal destruction of big differentiated objects
($M_{\rm body}=10^{21-23}$) that experience close encounters with Saturn or
Uranus. We find that about $0.1-10$% of the mass of the passing body is
gravitationally captured around the planet. However, these fragments are
initially big chunks and have highly eccentric orbits around the planet. Then,
we perform N-body simulations including the planet's oblateness, starting with
data obtained from the SPH simulations. Our N-body simulations show that the
chunks are tidally destroyed during their next several orbits. Their individual
orbits then start to precess incoherently around the planet's equator, which
enhances their encounter velocities on longer-term evolution, resulting in more
destructive impacts. These collisions would damp their eccentricities resulting
in a progressive collapse of the debris cloud into a thin equatorial and
low-eccentricity ring. These high energy impacts are expected to be
catastrophic enough to produce small particles. Our numerical results also show
that the mass of formed rings is large enough to explain current rings
including inner regular satellites around Saturn and Uranus. In the case of
Uranus, a body can go deeper inside the planet's Roche limit resulting in a
more efficient capture of rocky material compared to Saturn's case in which
mostly ice is captured. Thus, our results can naturally explain the
compositional difference between the rings of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

giants form in a variety of surface patterns and amplitudes. Whereas the
differential rotation on the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn features a super-rotating
equatorial region, the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus harbour an equatorial jet
slower than the planetary rotation. Global numerical models covering the
optically thick, deep-reaching and rapidly rotating convective envelopes of gas
giants reproduce successfully the prograde jet at the equator. In such models,
convective columns shaped by the dominant Coriolis force typically exhibit a
consistent prograde tilt. Hence angular momentum is pumped away from the
rotation axis via Reynolds stresses. Those models are found to be strongly
geostrophic, hence a modulation of the zonal flow structure along the axis of
rotation, e.g. introduced by persistent latitudinal temperature gradients,
seems of minor importance. Within our study we stimulate these thermal
gradients and the resulting ageostrophic flows by applying an axisymmetric and
equatorially symmetric outer boundary heat flux anomaly ($Y_{20}$) with
variable amplitude and sign. Such a forcing pattern mimics the thermal effect
of intense solar or stellar irradiation. Our results suggest that the
ageostrophic flows are linearly amplified with the forcing amplitude $q^\star$
leading to a more pronounced dimple of the equatorial jet (alike Jupiter). The
geostrophic flow contributions, however, are suppressed for weak $q^\star$, but
inverted and re-amplified once $q^\star$ exceeds a critical value. The inverse
geostrophic differential rotation is consistently maintained by now also
inversely tilted columns and reminiscent of zonal flow profiles observed for
the ice giants. Analysis of the main force balance and parameter studies
further foster these results.

provide the value of this constant locally, this coupling constant can
operationally be meaningful only in a local area. Regarding this point, to
obtain an extension of GR for the large scale, we replace it by a conformal
invariant model and then, reduce this model to a theory for the cosmological
scale via breaking down the conformal symmetry through singling out a specific
conformal frame which is characterized by the large scale characteristics of
the universe. Finally, we come to the same field equations that historically
were proposed by Einstein for the cosmological scale (GR plus the cosmological
constant) as the result of his endeavor for making GR consistent with the Mach
principle. However, we declare that the obtained field equations in this

numbers of memristors can be combined to obtain useful behaviours unachievable
by individual devices. In this work, we link the memristive fuse concept with
that of the Complementary Resistive Switch (CRS), exploit that link to
experimentally demonstrate a practical memristive fuse using TiOx-based ReRAM
cells and explain its basic operational principles. The fuse is stimulated by
trains of identical pulses where successive pulse trains feature opposite
polarities. In response, we observe a gradual (analogue) drop in resistive
state followed by a gradual recovery phase regardless of input stimulus
polarity; echoing traditional, binary CRS behaviour. This analogue switching
property opens the possibility of operating the memristive fuse as a
single-component step change detector. Moreover, we discover that the
characteristics of the individual memristors used to demonstrate the memristive
fuse concept in this work allow our fuse to be operated in a regime where one
of the two constituent devices can be switched largely independently from the
other. This property, not present in the traditional CRS, indicates that the
inherently analogue memristive fuse architecture may support additional
operational flexibility through e.g. allowing finer control over its resistive
state.

approximation, to describe closed loop plectonemes. This framework incorporates
weak helix structure dependent forces into the determination of the free energy
and average structure of a plectoneme. Notably, due to their chiral nature,
helix structure dependent forces break the symmetry between left and right
handed supercoiling. The theoretical approach, presented here, also provides a
systematic way of enforcing the topological constraint of closed loop
supercoiling in the variational approximation. At large plectoneme lengths, by
considering correlation functions in an expansion in terms of the spatial mean
twist density about its thermally averaged value, it can be argued that
topological constraint may be approximated with by replacing twist and writhe
by their thermal averages. A Lagrange Multiplier, containing the sum of average
twist and writhe, can be added to the free energy to conveniently inforce this
result. The average writhe can be calculated through the thermal average of
Gauss integral in the variational approximation. Furthermore, this approach
allows for a possible way to calculate finite size corrections due to the
topological constraint. Using interaction energy terms from the mean-field
Kornyshev-Leikin theory, for parameter values that correspond to weak helix
dependent forces, we calculate the free energy, fluctuation magnitudes and mean
geometric parameters for the plectoneme. We see a slight asymmetry, where
interestingly enough left handed supercoils have looser structure than right
handed ones, although a lower free energy, unlike what previous ground state
calculations would suggest.

dual to the notion of a quotient set or partition, and recently the logic of
partitions has been developed in a parallel relationship to the Boolean logic
of subsets (subset logic is usually mis-specified as the special case of
propositional logic). What then is the quantitative measure based on partition
logic in the same sense that logical probability theory is based on subset
logic? It is a measure of information that is named ""logical entropy"" in view
of that logical basis. This paper develops the notion of logical entropy and
the basic notions of the resulting logical information theory. Then an
extensive comparison is made with the corresponding notions based on Shannon
entropy.

this article we introduce intertwiner and spin net models for the quantum group
$\text{SU}(2)_k \times \text{SU}(2)_k$, which implement the simplicity
constraints analogous to 4D Euclidean spin foam models, namely the
Barrett-Crane (BC) and the Engle-Pereira-Rovelli-Livine/Freidel-Krasnov
(EPRL/FK) model. These models are numerically coarse grained via tensor network
renormalization, allowing us to trace the flow of simplicity constraints to
larger scales. In order to perform these simulations we have substantially
adapted tensor network algorithms, which we discuss in detail.
  The BC and the EPRL/FK model behave very differently under coarse graining:
While the unique BC intertwiner model is a fixed point and therefore
constitutes a 2D topological phase, BC spin net models flow away from the
initial simplicity constraints and converge to several different topological
phases. Most of these phases correspond to decoupling spin foam vertices,
however we find also a new phase in which this is not the case, and in which a
non-trivial version of the simplicity constraints holds. The coarse graining
flow of the BC spin net models indicates furthermore that the phase transitions
are not of second order. The EPRL/FK model by contrast reveals a far more
intricate and complex dynamics. We observe an immediate flow away from the
original simplicity constraints, however, with the truncation employed here,
the models generically do not converge to a fixed point.
  The results show that the imposition of simplicity constraints can indeed
lead to interesting and complex dynamics. Thus we will need to further develop
coarse graining tools to efficiently study the large scale behaviour of spin
foam models, in particular for the EPRL/FK model.

interacting many-body systems without conventional long-range order. Here we
discuss possible extensions of this concept to density matrices describing
statistical ensembles. For a large class of quasi-thermal states, which can be
realized as thermal states of some quasi-local Hamiltonian, we generalize
earlier definitions of density matrix topology to generic many-body systems
with strong correlations. We point out that the robustness of topological
order, defined as a pattern of long-range entanglement, depends crucially on
the perturbations under consideration. While it is intrinsically protected
against local perturbations of arbitrary strength in an infinite closed quantum
system, purely local perturbations can destroy topological order in open
systems coupled to baths if the coupling is sufficiently strong. We discuss our
classification scheme using the finite-temperature quantum Hall states and
point out that the classical Hall effect can be understood as a finite
temperature topological phase.

OSDI'16 (to appear)",,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Programming with replicated objects is difficult. Developers must face the
fundamental trade-off between consistency and performance head on, while
struggling with the complexity of distributed storage stacks. We introduce
Correctables, a novel abstraction that hides most of this complexity, allowing
developers to focus on the task of balancing consistency and performance. To
aid developers with this task, Correctables provide incremental consistency
guarantees, which capture successive refinements on the result of an ongoing
operation on a replicated object. In short, applications receive both a
preliminary---fast, possibly inconsistent---result, as well as a
final---consistent---result that arrives later.
  We show how to leverage incremental consistency guarantees by speculating on
preliminary values, trading throughput and bandwidth for improved latency. We
experiment with two popular storage systems (Cassandra and ZooKeeper) and three
applications: a Twissandra-based microblogging service, an ad serving system,
and a ticket selling system. Our evaluation on the Amazon EC2 platform with
YCSB workloads A, B, and C shows that we can reduce the latency of strongly
consistent operations by up to 40% (from 100ms to 60ms) at little cost (10%
bandwidth increase, 6% throughput drop) in the ad system. Even if the
preliminary result is frequently inconsistent (25% of accesses), incremental
consistency incurs a bandwidth overhead of only 27%.

of bosonic and fermionic Laughlin wave functions with number of particles per

analytically on lattices with $\mu$ particles per lattice site, where $\mu$ may
be different than $\nu$. We give numerical evidence that these states have the
same topological properties as the corresponding continuum Laughlin states for
different values of $q$ and for different fillings $\mu$. These states define,
in particular, particle-hole symmetric lattice Fractional Quantum Hall states
when the lattice is half-filled. On the square lattice it is observed that for
$q\leq 4$ this particle-hole symmetric state displays the topological
properties of the continuum Laughlin state at filling fraction $\nu=1/q$, while
for larger $q$ there is a transition towards long-range ordered
anti-ferromagnets. This effect does not persist if the lattice is deformed from
a square to a triangular lattice, or on the Kagome lattice, in which case the
topological properties of the state are recovered. We then show that changing
the number of particles while keeping the expression of these wave functions
identical gives rise to edge states that have the same correlations in the bulk
as the reference lattice Laughlin states but a different density at the edge.
We derive an exact parent Hamiltonian for which all these edge states are
ground states with different number of particles. In addition this Hamiltonian
admits the reference lattice Laughlin state as its unique ground state of
filling factor $1/q$. Parent Hamiltonians are also derived for the lattice
Laughlin states at other fillings of the lattice, when $\mu\leq 1/q$ or
$\mu\geq 1-1/q$ and when $q=4$ also at half-filling.

found a gradual degradation of the photometric performance over time for the
first 14 months of data. Here we have analysed the anti-center runs IRa01

studied by Aigrain as well, so we are able to compare our results. The two last
runs allowed us to evaluate the trend of photometric degradation over more than
5 years. We obtain low observational point-to-point noise, although a factor 3
bigger than the source photon noise. We find effects showing the ageing of the
CoRoT CCDs. On 2h time scales we notice a receding photometric performance,
with a noise increase of about 2.1 times across the four analysed runs,
corresponding to a 15% increase per year. Correlated noise becomes more
important than white uncorrelated noise for the two last studied runs, LRa03

operations, with a 30% noise increase, opening up a two-ageing-timescales

landscape of low-power applications such as the Internet of Things, Radio
Frequency identification (RFID) networks, etc. Although there has been some
progress towards multi-antenna multi-sine WPT design, the large-scale design of
WPT, reminiscent of massive MIMO in communications, remains an open challenge.
In this paper, we derive efficient multiuser algorithms based on a
generalizable optimization framework, in order to design transmit sinewaves
that maximize the weighted-sum/minimum rectenna output DC voltage. The study
highlights the significant effect of the nonlinearity introduced by the
rectification process on the design of waveforms in multiuser systems.
Interestingly, in the single-user case, the optimal spatial domain beamforming,
obtained prior to the frequency domain power allocation optimization, turns out
to be Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT). In contrast, in the general weighted
sum criterion maximization problem, the spatial domain beamforming optimization
and the frequency domain power allocation optimization are coupled. Assuming
channel hardening, low-complexity algorithms are proposed based on asymptotic
analysis, to maximize the two criteria. The structure of the asymptotically
optimal spatial domain precoder can be found prior to the optimization. The
performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated. Numerical results confirm
the inefficiency of the linear model-based design for the single and multi-user
scenarios. It is also shown that as nonlinear model-based designs, the proposed
algorithms can benefit from an increasing number of sinewaves.

Bulman-Fleming that $M\wr Sing_n$ is idempotent generated if and only if the
set $M/L$ of $L$-classes of $M$ forms a chain under the usual ordering of
$L$-classes, and we give a presentation for $M\wr Sing_n$ in terms of

task of detecting different types of eye movement in a continuous stream of
gaze data - are limited in that they either involve thresholding on
hand-crafted signal features, require individual detectors each only detecting
a single movement, or require pre-segmented data. We propose a novel approach
for eye movement detection that only involves learning a single detector
end-to-end, i.e. directly from the continuous gaze data stream and
simultaneously for different eye movements without any manual feature crafting
or segmentation. Our method is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN)
that recently demonstrated superior performance in a variety of tasks in
computer vision, signal processing, and machine learning. We further introduce
a novel multi-participant dataset that contains scripted and free-viewing
sequences of ground-truth annotated saccades, fixations, and smooth pursuits.
We show that our CNN-based method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a
large margin on this challenging dataset, thereby underlining the significant
potential of this approach for holistic, robust, and accurate eye movement
protocol analysis.

Local control design is cast into a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problem
that, if unfeasible, allows one to deny plug-in requests that might be

molecular dynamics perspective. A two-dimensional model is adopted, which
assumes reactive disks of type A and B in a fixed area that react to form type
C products if an activation threshold for impact is surpassed. Such a reaction
liberates kinetic energy to the product particles, representative of the heat
release. The results for the ignition delay are compared with those obtained
from the continuum description assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium, in
order to assess the role played by molecular fluctuations. Results show two
regimes of non-equilibrium ignition whereby ignition occurs at different times
as compared to that from the continuum description. The first regime is at low
activation energies, where the ignition time is found to be higher than that
expected from theory for all values of heat release, in agreement with
predictions from Prigogine and Xhrouet who attribute this departure to
non-equilibrium effects. Results suggest the ignition is spatially homogeneous
in this regime. The second regime occurs at high activation energies and
sufficiently large heat release values. In this regime, ignition times are
found to be dependent on domain size, with larger domains yielding shorter
ignition delays than expected. Results for larger systems agree with the
expectations by Prigogine and Mahieu, who predict a non-equilibrium reaction
rate larger than expected for a homogeneous system in equilibrium. Results
yield a large variance for ignition times under these conditions, suggesting a
departure from homogeneous combustion. The results obtained are in qualitative
agreement with experimental observations of auto-ignition at relatively low
temperatures, where hot-spot ignition and associated ignition delays lower than
predicted are generally observed.

a sinusoidal zonal flow is imposed. The analysis uses the shearing sheet model
and is carried out both in isothermal and adiabatic conditions, with and
without self-gravity (SG). In the non-SG regime a structure in the potential
vorticity (PV) leads to a non-axisymmetric Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability;
in the short-wavelength limit its growth rate agrees with the incompressible
calculation by Lithwick (2007), which only considers perturbations elongated in
the streamwise direction. The instability's strength is analysed as a function
of the structure's properties, and zonal flows are found to be stable if their
wavelength is $\gtrsim 8H$, where $H$ is the disc's scale height, regardless of
the value of the adiabatic index $\gamma$. The non-axisymmetric KH instability
can operate in Rayleigh-stable conditions, and it therefore represents the
limiting factor to the structure's properties. Introducing SG triggers a second
non-axisymmetric instability, which is found to be located around a PV maximum,
while the KH instability is linked to a PV minimum, as expected. In the
adiabatic regime, the same gravitational instability is detected even when the
structure is present only in the entropy (not in the PV) and the instability
spreads to weaker SG conditions as the entropy structure's amplitude is
increased. This eventually yields a non-axisymmetric instability in the non-SG
regime, albeit of weak strength, localised around an entropy maximum.

Furthermore, we argue that it is more appropriate to assess the accuracy of

evaluation metric like mean squared error than it is to use classification
accuracy. This leads to the formulation of the prediction of KL grades as a
regression problem and further improves accuracy. Results on a dataset of X-ray

mechanisms: off-resonant tunneling, on-resonant coherent (ballistic) motion,
and multi-step hopping. These mechanisms are identified by studying the

on a simple one-dimensional model for molecular junctions, we derive
approximate expressions for the thermopower in these different regimes.
Analytical results are compared to numerical simulations, performed using a

genuine presence of de Sitter vacuum spontaneously breaks the noncompact gauge

transmutation in quantum field theories, and thus the symmetry is radiatively
broken through the one-loop Effective Coleman-Weinberg potential. We show that
the mere expectation of reducing to Einstein's gravity in the broken phases

actuator pitch and natural guide star availability. We provide potential areas
where costs savings can be made, and investigate trade-offs between performance

trade-off for laser guide star wavefront sensor pixel scale of about 0.7
arcseconds per pixel, and a field of view of at least 7 arcseconds, that EMCCD
technology should be used for natural guide star wavefront sensors even if
reduced frame rate is necessary, and that sky coverage can be improved by a
slight reduction in natural guide star sub-aperture count without significantly

be maintained across a wide field of view, up to 7 arcminutes in diameter. We
also recommend the use of at least 4 laser guide stars, and include

decades, due to the relentless exploration of new detection methods and
refinement of existing ones. Yet astrometry offers a unique and untapped
potential of discovery of habitable-zone low-mass planets around all the
solar-like stars of the solar neighborhood. To fulfill this goal, astrometry
must be paired with high precision calibration of the detector.
  Aims: We present a way to calibrate a detector for high accuracy astrometry.
An experimental testbed combining an astrometric simulator and an
interferometric calibration system is used to validate both the hardware needed
for the calibration and the signal processing methods. The objective is an
accuracy of 5e-6 pixel on the location of a Nyquist sampled polychromatic point
spread function.
  Methods: The interferometric calibration system produced modulated Young
fringes on the detector. The Young fringes were parametrized as products of
time and space dependent functions, based on various pixel parameters. The
minimization of func- tion parameters was done iteratively, until convergence
was obtained, revealing the pixel information needed for the calibration of
astrometric measurements.
  Results: The calibration system yielded the pixel positions to an accuracy
estimated at 4e-4 pixel. After including the pixel position information, an
astrometric accuracy of 6e-5 pixel was obtained, for a PSF motion over more
than five pixels. In the static mode (small jitter motion of less than 1e-3
pixel), a photon noise limited precision of 3e-5 pixel was reached.

that for sufficiently strong self-propulsion they phase-separate into a dense

The coarsening dynamics towards the phase-separated state is diffusive in an

for the autonomic nervous system and are thus critical in enabling the body to
respond effectively to changes in blood pressure. These neurons can be
separated into two types (A and C) based on the myelination of their axons and
their distinct firing patterns elicited in response to specific pressure
stimuli. This study has developed a comprehensive model of the afferent
baroreceptor discharge built on physiological knowledge of arterial wall
mechanics, firing rate responses to controlled pressure stimuli, and ion
channel dynamics within the baroreceptor neurons. With this model, we were able
to predict firing rates observed in previously published experiments in both A-
and C-type neurons. These results were obtained by adjusting model parameters
determining the maximal ion-channel conductances. The observed variation in the
model parameters are hypothesized to correspond to physiological differences
between A- and C-type neurons. In agreement with published experimental
observations, our simulations suggest that a twofold lower potassium
conductance in C-type neurons is responsible for the observed sustained basal
firing, whereas a tenfold higher mechanosensitive conductance is responsible
for the greater firing rate observed in A-type neurons. A better understanding
of the difference between the two neuron types can potentially be used to gain
more insight into the underlying pathophysiology facilitating development of
targeted interventions improving baroreflex function in diseased individuals,
e.g. in patients with autonomic failure, a syndrome that is difficult to
diagnose in terms of its pathophysiology.

the narrow-line emitting gas visible by XMM RGS and make comparisons between

usually absorbed within the soft X-ray band, with a typical neutral column
density of >1.5 x 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and only 1 observation of the 9 we
investigate shows low enough absorption for the continuum to emerge in the soft
X-rays. We stack all observations from 2004-07, and separately three of the
four observations from 2012-13, analysing the less absorbed observation
separately. We first model the spectra using gaussian profiles representing the
narrow line emission. We fit physically motivated models to the 2012-13 stacked
spectra, with collisionally ionised components representing the starburst
emission and photoionised line emission models representing the AGN line
emission. The collisional and photoionised emission line models are fitted
together on top of a physical continuum and absorption model. The X-ray narrow
emission line spectrum of NGC 1365 is well represented by a combination of two
collisionally ionised and three photoionised phases of emitting gas, all with
higher than solar nitrogen abundances. This physical model was fitted to the
2012-13 stacked spectrum, and yet also fits well to the 2004-07 stacked
spectrum, without changing any characteristics of the emitting gas phases. Our
2004-07 results are consistent with previous emission line work using these
data, with 5 additional emission lines detected in both this and the 2012-13

existence of Gribov copies to the mass deformed Bagger--Lambert--Gustavsson
(BLG) theory in $\mathcal{N} =1 $ superspace. The restriction of the domain of
integration in the Euclidean functional integral to the first Gribov horizon is
implemented, by adding a non-local horizon term to the effective action.
Furthermore, the soft breaking of the BRST symmetry due to horizon term is
restored with the help of external sources. We compute the various Ward
identities for this theory relying on the Lie 3-algebras.

continue with more complex chemical, biological, life and social and technical

their entropy. We present a method to attribute the same entropy to known
physical systems and to complex organic molecules up to a DNA. The important
steps in this program and the basic obstacles are discussed.

  Volume 1, Nr. 1, August 2016",,,"q-bio.PE physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Culture evolves, not just in the trivial sense that cultures change over
time, but also in the strong sense that such change is governed by Darwinian
principles. Both biological and cultural evolution are essentially cumulative
selection processes in which information (whether genetic or cultural) is
sieved, retained and then transmitted to the next generation. In both domains
such a process will result in recognizable lineages and tree-like phylogenies
so characteristic of Darwinian evolution. Because a principle of inheritance
(i.e., faithful replication of information) holds in both domains, we may trace
back particular transmission histories and identify the forces that influenced
them. The idea that culture evolves is quite old, but only in recent years
there has been a serious effort to turn this idea into science. This article
offers a concise analysis of how a rudimentary idea gradually evolved into a
thriving research program.

various sciences and engineering disciplines. We discuss invariants of strongly
connected directed graphs - minimal number of vertices or edges necessary to
remove to make remaining graphs not strongly connected. By analogy with
undirected graphs these invariants are called strong vertex/edge
connectivities. We review some properties of these invariants. Computational
results for some publicly available connectome graphs used in neuroscience are
described.

identifiability, we present a method using linear algebra to find identifiable
functions of the parameters of a model for unidentifiable models. On
observability, we present techniques using Gr\""obner bases and algebraic
matroids to test algebraic observability of state space models. On
indistinguishability, we present a sufficient condition for distinguishability
using computational algebra and demonstrate testing indistinguishability.

agree well with the experimental results at the RHIC-BES energies. Thus, we
have utilized UrQMD in simulating particle ratios at other beam energies down
to 3 GeV, which will be accessed at NICA and FAIR future facilities. We observe
that the particle ratios for crossover and first-order phase transition,
implemented in the hybrid UrQMD v3.4, are nearly indistinguishable, especially
at low energies (at large baryon chemical potentials or high density).
