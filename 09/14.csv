exoplanet WASP-17b during its primary transit, for the purpose of differential
spectrophotometry analysis. We use the instrument in its Mask eXchange Unit
(MXU) mode to simultaneously obtain low resolution spectra of the planet
hosting star, as well as several reference stars in the field of view. The
integration of these spectra within broadband and smaller 100$\AA$ bins
provides us with 'white' and spectrophotometric light curves, from 5700 to
8000$\AA$. Through modelling the white light curve, we obtain refined bulk and
transit parameters of the planet, as well as wavelength-dependent variations of
the planetary radius from smaller spectral bins through which the transmission
spectrum is obtained. The inference of transit parameters, as well as the noise
statistics, is performed using a Gaussian Process model. We achieve a typical
precision in the transit depth of a few hundred parts per million from various
transit light curves. From the transmission spectra we rule out a flat spectrum
at >3$\sigma$ and detect marginal presence of the pressure-broadened sodium
wings. Furthermore, we detect the wing of the potassium absorption line in the
upper atmosphere of the planet with 3$\sigma$ confidence, both facts pointing
to a relatively shallow temperature gradient of the atmosphere. These
conclusions are mostly consistent with previous studies of this exo-atmosphere,
although previous potassium measurements have been inconclusive.

divergence over the parametric class of multinomial models lead to structure
discovery methods whose mean squared error achieves parametric convergence
rates as the sample size grows. However, a naive application of this method to

contrast gradient systems in that MLP does not have to cross the separatrix at

A numerical approach for identifying such unstable periodic orbits is proposed
based on String method. In a special class of nongradient systems
(`orthogonal-type'), there are provably local MLPs that cross such saddle point
or hyperbolic periodic orbit, and the separatrix crossing location determines
the associated local maximum of transition rate. In general cases, however, the

semi-supervised eigenvectors, to study the diversity of galaxies. This
technique permits us to characterize empirically the natural variations in
observed spectra data, and we illustrate how this approach can be used in an
exploratory manner to highlight both large-scale global as well as small-scale
local structure in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. We use this method in
a way that simultaneously takes into account the measurements of spectral lines
as well as the continuum shape. Unlike Principal Component Analysis, this
method does not assume that the Euclidean distance between galaxy spectra is a
good global measure of similarity between all spectra, but instead it only
assumes that local difference information between similar spectra is reliable.
Moreover, unlike other nonlinear dimensionality methods, this method can be
used to characterize very finely both small-scale local as well as large-scale
global properties of realistic noisy data. The power of the method is
demonstrated on the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample by illustrating that the derived
embeddings of spectra carry an unprecedented amount of information. By using a
straightforward global or unsupervised variant, we observe that the main
features correlate strongly with star formation rate and that they clearly
separate active galactic nuclei. Computed parameters of the method can be used
to describe line strengths and their interdependencies. By using a
locally-biased or semi-supervised variant, we are able to focus on typical
variations around specific objects of astronomical interest. We present several
examples illustrating that this approach can enable new discoveries in the data
as well as a detailed understanding of very fine local structure that would
otherwise be overwhelmed by large-scale noise and global trends in the data.

Europe. According to a model of opinion dynamics from sociophysics the
machinery of Trump's amazing success obeys well-defined counter-intuitive
rules. Therefore, his success was in principle predictable from the start. The
model uses local majority rule arguments and obeys a threshold dynamics. The
associated tipping points are found to depend on the leading collective
beliefs, cognitive biases and prejudices of the social group which undertakes
the public debate. And here comes the sesame of the Trump campaign, which
develops along two successive steps. During a first moment, Trump's statement
produces a majority of voters against him. But at the same time, according to
the model the shocking character of the statement modifies the prejudice
balance. In case the prejudice is present even being frozen among voters, the
tipping point is lowered at Trump's benefit. Nevertheless, although the tipping
point has been lowered by the activation of frozen prejudices it is
instrumental to preserve enough support from openly prejudiced people to be
above the threshold. Then, as infuriated voters launch intense debate,
occurrence of ties will drive progressively hostile people to shift their
voting intention without needing to endorse the statement which has infuriated
them. The on going debate does drive towards a majority for Trump. The possible
Trump victory at November Presidential election is discussed. In particular,
the model shows that to eventually win the Presidential election, Trump must
not modify his past shocking attitude but to appeal to a different spectrum of
frozen prejudices, which are common to both Democrats and Republicans.

such effects are expected in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates, subject to
dipole-dipole interaction and short-range repulsion. Magnetic quantum gases and
in particular Dysprosium gases, offering a comparable short-range contact and a
long-range dipolar interaction energy, remarkably exhibit such emergent
phenomena. In addition an effective cancellation of mean-field effects of the
two interactions results in a pronounced importance of quantum-mechanical
beyond mean-field effects. For a weakly-dominant dipolar interaction the
striking consequence is the existence of a new state of matter equilibrated by
the balance between weak mean-field attraction and beyond mean-field repulsion.
Though exemplified here in the case of dipolar Bose gases, this state of matter
should appear also with other microscopic interactions types, provided a

divide among them a heterogeneous resource (``cake''), such that the resulting
division is fair according to each agent's individual preferences. However,
these algorithms either ignore the geometry of the resource altogether, or
assume it is one-dimensional. In practice, it is often required to divide
multi-dimensional resources, such as land-estates or advertisement spaces in
print or electronic media. In such cases, the geometric shape of the allotted

advertisements, in order to be useful, the allotments should be squares or
rectangles with bounded aspect-ratio. We thus introduce the problem of fair
land division --- fair division of a multi-dimensional resource wherein the
allocated piece must have a pre-specified geometric shape. We present
constructive division algorithms that satisfy the two most prominent fairness
criteria, namely envy-freeness and proportionality. In settings where
proportionality cannot be achieved due to the geometric constraints, our
algorithms provide a partially-proportional division, guaranteeing that the
fraction allocated to each agent be at least a certain positive constant. We
prove that in many natural settings the envy-freeness requirement is compatible

remains largely unknown. Until the discovery of the first ULX pulsar, M82 X-2,
the mechanism powering the large luminosities of most ULXs was thought to be
super-Eddington accretion onto black holes. The ULX pulsar clearly indicates
that this hypothesis is not universal, and the question arises if other ULXs
are as well powered by accretion onto neutron stars. One possibility to have
highly super-Eddington luminosity is by reducing the opacity by strong magnetic
fields as in magnetars, as proposed for M82 X-2. To study the link between ULXs
and magnetar bursts/flares, we have performed a comparative spectral study
between these classes, which both emit at similar super-Eddington luminosities
at around $L \sim 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We find that, when their spectra are
fitted with dual thermal models, the long term spectral variations of ULXs are
similar to short term spectral variability seen during magnetar flares. In both
classes of sources the black body temperatures and radii follow similar
$R_\textrm{bb} \propto T_\textrm{bb}^{-2}$ trends, the only difference being
that the temperatures in ULXs are an order of magnitude lower and thus they
have much larger characteristic emission areas. Furthermore, the ratio between
the luminosities of the two black body components shows the same one-to-one
dependence in ULXs and magnetars. We discuss the possible origins of these
similarities, and speculate that the reason for the lack of pulsations in
""magnetar-ULXs"" could be that their photospheres are extended far beyond the
neutron star surface.

radii determined by probing for possible front- and back-door intruder states,

example, restricting the target state to, say, triple or quadruple excitations
might remove intruders present in series that target the full configuration

that whereas a CC perturbation series might converge within standard
correlation consistent basis sets, it may start to diverge whenever these

the CNN by identifying features that capture the hierarchical support relations
between filters in different CNN layers and locating their 3D positions by
tracing activations backwards in the CNN. When this backward trace terminates
in the RGB-D image, important manipulable structures are thereby localized.
These features that reside in different layers of the CNN are then associated
with controllers that engage different kinematic subchains in the hand/arm

requirement for optimal biometric features, there is no general agreement on
how to assess temporal persistence. We suggest that the best way to assess
temporal persistence is to perform a test-retest study, and assess test-retest
reliability. For ratio-scale features that are normally distributed, this is
best done using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). For 10 distinct
data sets (8 eye-movement related, and 2 gait related), we calculated the
test-retest reliability ('Temporal persistence') of each feature, and compared
biometric performance of high-ICC features to lower ICC features, and to the
set of all features. We demonstrate that using a subset of only high-ICC
features produced superior Rank-1-Identification Rate (Rank-1-IR) performance
in 9 of 10 databases (p = 0.01, one-tailed). For Equal Error Rate (EER), using
a subset of only high-ICC features produced superior performance in 8 of 10
databases (p = 0.055, one-tailed). In general, then, prescreening potential
biometric features, and choosing only highly reliable features will yield
better performance than lower ICC features or than the set of all features
combined. We hypothesize that this would likely be the case for any biometric
modality where the features can be expressed as quantitative values on an
interval or ratio scale, assuming an adequate number of relatively independent
features.

Stellar mass and star formation rates are assigned to all simulation subhalos
at all times, using subhalo mass gain to determine stellar mass gain. The
observational properties of the resulting galaxy distributions are compared to
each other and observations for a range of redshifts from 0-2. Although many of
the galaxy distributions seem reasonable, there are noticeable differences as
simulations, subhalo mass gain definitions, or subhalo mass definitions are
altered, suggesting that the model should change as these properties are
varied. Agreement with observations may improve by including redshift
dependence in the added-by-hand random contribution to star formation rate.
There appears to be an excess of faint quiescent galaxies as well (perhaps due
in part to differing definitions of quiescence). The ensemble of galaxy
formation histories for these models tend to have more scatter around their
average histories (for a fixed final stellar mass) than the two more predictive

immersed boundary (IB) method with discrete fiber-based structures, to one
using a continuum mechanics-based model that is approximated based on finite
elements (IB-FE). To deal with the leakage of flow when the Lagrangian mesh
becomes coarser than the fluid mesh, we employ adaptive interaction quadrature
points for Lagrangian-Eulerian interaction equations based on a previous work.
In particular, we introduce a new anisotropic adaptive interaction quadrature
rule. The new rule permits us to vary the interaction quadrature points not
only at each time-step and element but also at different orientations per
element. For the material model, we extend our previous fiber-based model to a
continuum-based model. We first study a case in which a three-dimensional short
tube is dilated. Results match very well with those from the implicit FE
method. We remark that in our IB-FE case, the three-dimensional tube undergoes
a very large deformation and the Lagrangian mesh-size becomes about 6 times of
Eulerian mesh-size. To validate the method in handling fiber-matrix material
models, we perform a second study on dilating a long fiber-reinforced tube.
Errors are small when we compare numerical solutions with analytical solutions.
The technique is then applied to the problem of esophageal transport. We
present three cases that differ in the material model and muscle fiber
architecture. The overall transport features are consistent with those from the
previous model. We remark that the continuum-based model can handle more
realistic and complicated material behavior. This is demonstrated in our third
case with spatially varying fiber architecture. We find this unique muscle
fiber architecture could generate a so-called pressure transition zone. This
suggests an important role of muscle fiber architecture in esophageal
transport.

discs using the Shakura and Sunyaev approach. The distinguishing feature of
this study is the accurate solution of the ionization balance equations and the
induction equation with Ohmic diffusion, magnetic ambipolar diffusion, buoyancy
and the Hall effect. We consider the ionization by cosmic rays, X-rays and
radionuclides, radiative recombinations, recombinations onto dust grains, and
also thermal ionization. The buoyancy appears as the additional mechanism of
magnetic flux escape in the steady-state solution of the induction equation.
Calculations show that Ohmic diffusion and magnetic ambipolar diffusion
constraint the generation of the magnetic field inside the `dead' zones. The
magnetic field in these regions is quasi-vertical. The buoyancy constraints the
toroidal magnetic field strength close to the disc inner edge. As a result, the
toroidal and vertical magnetic fields become comparable. The Hall effect is
important in the regions close to the borders of the `dead' zones because
electrons are magnetized there. The magnetic field in these regions is
quasi-radial. We calculate the magnetic field strength and geometry for the
discs with accretion rates $(10^{-8}-10^{-6})\,\rm{M}_{\odot}\,\rm{yr}^{-1}$.
The fossil magnetic field geometry does not change significantly during the
disc evolution while the accretion rate decreases. We construct the synthetic
maps of dust emission polarized due to the dust grain alignment by the magnetic
field. In the polarization maps, the `dead' zones appear as the regions with
the reduced values of polarization degree in comparison to those in the
adjacent regions.

entanglement between internal, discretely gauged degrees of freedom in a
quantum field theory. This concept originated in the program of reconstructing
spacetime from entanglement in holographic duality. We define entwinement
formally in terms of a novel replica method which uses twist operators charged
in a representation of the discrete gauge group. In terms of these twist
operators we define a non-local, gauge-invariant object whose expectation value
computes entwinement in a standard replica limit. We apply our method to the
computation of entwinement in symmetric orbifold conformal field theories in
1+1 dimensions, which have an $S_N$ gauging. Such a theory appears in the weak
coupling limit of the D1-D5 string theory which is dual to AdS$_3$ at strong

this article, we consider two classical NP-complete combinatorial optimization

multipartite entanglement can be distributed by means of a network of bipartite

however the microlensing data alone cannot distinguish between events due to
wide-separation (a>~10 AU) and free-floating planets. Assuming these STEs are
indeed due to planetary-mass objects, we aim to constrain the fraction of these
events that can be explained by bound but wide-separation planets. We fit the
observed timescale distribution with a lens mass function comprised of brown
dwarfs, main-sequence stars, and stellar remnants, finding and thus
corroborating the initial identification of an excess of STEs. We then include
a population of bound planets that are expected not to show signatures of the
primary lens (host) in their microlensing light curves and that are also
consistent with results from representative microlensing, radial velocity, and
direct imaging surveys. We find that bound planets alone cannot explain the
entire STE excess without violating the constraints from the surveys we
consider and thus some fraction of these events must be due to free-floating
planets, if our model for bound planets holds. We estimate a median fraction of
STEs due to free-floating planets to be f=0.67 (0.23-0.85 at 95% confidence)
when assuming ""hot-start"" planet evolutionary models and f=0.58 (0.14-0.83 at
95% confidence) for ""cold-start"" models. Assuming a delta-function distribution
of free-floating planets of mass m_p=2 M_Jup yields a number of free-floating
planets per main-sequence star of N=1.4 (0.48-1.8 at 95% confidence) in the
""hot-start"" case and N=1.2 (0.29-1.8 at 95% confidence) in the ""cold-start""

between distinct phase space regions in QCD and gauge theories and have proven
a challenge to understand using traditional resummation techniques. Recently,
the dressed gluon expansion was introduced that enables an expansion of the NGL
series in terms of a ""dressed gluon"" building block, defined by an all-orders
factorization theorem. Here, we clarify the nature of the dressed gluon
expansion, and prove that it has an infinite radius of convergence as a
solution to the leading logarithmic and large-$N_c$ master equation for NGLs,
the Banfi-Marchesini-Smye (BMS) equation. The dressed gluon expansion therefore
provides an expansion of the NGL series that can be truncated at any order,
with reliable uncertainty estimates. In contrast, manifest in the results of
the fixed-order expansion of the BMS equation up to 12-loops is a breakdown of
convergence at a finite value of $\alpha_s$log. We explain this finite radius
of convergence using the dressed gluon expansion, showing how the dynamics of
the buffer region, a region of phase space near the boundary of the jet that
was identified in early studies of NGLs, leads to large contributions to the
fixed order expansion. We also use the dressed gluon expansion to discuss the
convergence of the next-to-leading NGL series, and the role of collinear
logarithms that appear at this order. Finally, we show how an understanding of
the analytic behavior obtained from the dressed gluon expansion allows us to
improve the fixed order NGL series using conformal transformations to extend
the domain of analyticity. This allows us to calculate the NGL distribution for
all values of $\alpha_s$log from the coefficients of the fixed order expansion.

Usually bulk flow calculations try to approximate the flow that would occur in

the traditional methods for bulk flow estimation can overestimate the magnitude

the velocity distributions. Our results may explain why several bulk flow
measurements found bulk flow velocities that seem larger than those expected in
standard {\Lambda}CDM cosmologies. We recommend a different approach when
comparing bulk flows to cosmological models, in which the theoretical
prediction for each bulk flow measurement is calculated specifically for the
geometry and sampling rate of that survey. This means that bulk flow values
will not be comparable between surveys, but instead they are comparable with
cosmological models, which is the more important measure.

telescopes. A prominent flare observed in the optical/near-UV passbands was
found to be correlated with a concurrent $\gamma$-ray flare at a confidence
level $>$95$\%$, which suggests a co-spatial origin of the two. Moreover, the
flaring activity in the two regimes was accompanied by no significant spectral
variations. A peak in the X-ray light curve coincides with the peaks of the
fractional polarization curves at 43 and 86 GHz radio bands. No prominent
variation was noticed for the total intensity and the electric vector position
angle (EVPA) observations at radio bands during this period. We noticed a
possible hint of steepening of the radio spectrum with an increase in
percentage polarization, which suggests that the radio polarization variations
could be simply due to a spectral change. In a simple scenario, the correlated
optical/$\gamma$-ray flares could be caused by the same population of emitting
particles. The coincidence of the increase in radio polarization with the X-ray
flux supports the picture that X-rays are produced via inverse-Compton
scattering of radio photons. The observed fractional variability for the
$\gamma$-ray flare $\sim$0.23 does not exceed that in the optical regime, which
is inconsistent with what we usually observe for 3C 279; it could be due to
different dependencies of the magnetic field and the external radiation field

matter-nucleon scattering cross section, and compare our predictions with
current and future experimental results. We demonstrate that after taking into
account bounds from $B_s$ meson oscillations, dark matter direct detection, and
the CMB, the model is highly predictive: $B$ physics anomalies and a viable
particle dark matter candidate, with a mass of $\sim (5-23)$~GeV, can be
accommodated only in a tightly-constrained region of parameter space, with
sharp predictions for future experimental tests. The viable region of parameter
space expands if the dark matter is allowed to have $L_\mu-L_\tau$ charges that
are smaller than those of the SM leptons.

formation. We used the IRDIS near-IR subsystem of the extreme adaptive optics
imager SPHERE at the ESO/VLT to study the scattered light from the
circumstellar disk via high resolution polarimetry and angular differential
imaging. We imaged the disk in unprecedented detail and revealed four ring-like
brightness enhancements and corresponding gaps in the scattered light from the
disk surface with radii between 39 au and 341 au. We derived the inclination
and position angle as well as the height of the scattering surface of the disk
from our observational data. We found that the surface height profile can be
described by a single power law up to a separation ~270 au. Using the surface
height profile we measured the scattering phase function of the disk and found
that it is well consistent with theoretical models of compact dust aggregates.
We discuss the origin of the detected features and find that low mass (< 1

Padoan (J. Fluid Mech. 661 73, 2010) for inertial particle relative velocities
in isotropic turbulence. We focus on the most difficult regime to model, the
dissipation range, and find that the modified Pan \& Padoan model (that uses
the BIT dispersion theory) can lead to significantly improved predictions for
the relative velocities, when compared with Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS)
data. However, when the particle separation distance, $r$, is less than the
Kolmogorov length scale, $\eta$, the modified model overpredicts the DNS data.
We explain how these overpredictions arise from two assumptions in the BIT
dispersion theory, that are in general not satisfied when the final separation
of the BIT dispersing particles is $<\eta$. We then demonstrate the failure of
both the original and modified versions of the Pan \& Padoan model to predict
the correct scale-invariant forms for the inertial particle relative velocity
structure functions in the dissipation regime. It is shown how this failure,
which is also present in other models, is associated with our present inability

  Then there is an infinite sequence of times $\{t_n\}$ at which the random

choice of $(G,\rho)$), there is a number $C > 0$ such that \[ \mathbb{E}

surely does not admit a non-constant harmonic function of sublinear growth.

enrich them in iron, explaining the observational trends. Interestingly, there

in which optical excitation and probe pulses irradiate the sample many times,
each measurement providing information about the sample response at just one
probe delay time following excitation, with each measurement at a high
repetition rate and with the sample fully recovering its initial state in
between measurements. Using a single-shot, real-time measurement method, we
were able to observe the photoinduced phase transition from the semimetallic,
low-symmetry phase of crystalline bismuth into a high-symmetry phase whose
existence at high electronic excitation densities was predicted based on
earlier measurements at moderate excitation densities below the damage
threshold. Our observations indicate that coherent lattice vibrational motion
launched upon photoexcitation with an incident fluence above 10 mJ/cm2 in bulk
bismuth brings the lattice structure directly into the high-symmetry
configuration for tens of picoseconds, after which carrier relaxation and
diffusion restore the equilibrium lattice configuration.

grid has led to the emergence of so-called prosumers, who can both consume as

resources, the stress on power generation and supply system can be
significantly reduced during high demand periods. However, this also creates a
significant challenge for conventional power plants that suddenly need to ramp
up quickly when the renewable energy drops off. In this paper, we propose an
energy consumption scheduling problem for prosumers to minimize the peak ramp
of the system. The optimal schedule of prosumers can be obtained by solving the
centralized optimization problem. However, due to the privacy concerns and the
distributed topology of the power system, the centralized design is difficult
to implement in practice. Therefore, we propose the distributed algorithms to
efficiently solve the centralized problem using the alternating direction
method of multiplier (ADMM), in which each prosumer independently schedules its
energy consumption profile. The simulation results demonstrate the convergence
performance of the proposed algorithms as well as the capability of our model
in reducing the peak ramp of the system.

Witten's $3$- and $4$-spin theories). We then focus on the recursion relation
satisfied by the DR Hamiltonian densities and, abstracting from its geometric
origin, we use it to characterize and construct a new family of quantum and
classical integrable systems which we call of double ramification type, as they
satisfy all of the main properties of the DR hierarchy. In the second part, we
obtain new insight towards the Miura equivalence conjecture between the DR and
Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchies, via a geometric interpretation of the correlators
forming the double ramification tau-function. We then show that the candidate
Miura transformation between the DR and DZ hierarchies (which we uniquely
identified in our previous paper) indeed turns the Dubrovin-Zhang Poisson

magnetic field generation within planetary interiors. The Prandtl number, $Pr$,

suggesting that the inertial force may not be important on the small scales of
convection as long as the buoyancy force is not too strong. We develop
asymptotic dynamo models for the case of small Rossby number and large Prandtl
number in which inertia is absent on the convective scale. The relevant
diffusivity parameter for this limit is the compositional Roberts number, $q =
D/\eta$, which is the ratio of compositional and magnetic diffusivities. Dynamo
models are developed for both order one $q$ and the more geophysically relevant
low $q$ limit. For both cases the ratio of magnetic to kinetic energy
densities, $M$, is asymptotically large and reflects the fact that Alfv\'en
waves have been filtered from the dynamics. Along with previous investigations
of asymptotic dynamo models for $Pr=O(1)$, our results show that the ratio $M$
is not a useful indicator of dominant force balances in the momentum equation
since many different asymptotic limits of $M$ can be obtained without changing
the leading order geostrophic balance. Furthermore, the present models show
that inertia is not a requirement for driving low $q$, large-scale dynamos.

bright late-type stars, and to classify them. The proposed method identifies a
high fraction of the supergiants (SGs) in our test sample, which cover a wide

spectral types from G0 up to late-M. In addition, it is capable to separate
most of the non-SGs in the sample, identifying as SGs only a very small

shows that it is more efficient and selects less interlopers. A way to
automatically assign a spectral type to the SGs is also developed. We apply
this study to spectra at the resolution and spectral range of the Gaia RVS,

already proposed a quantum repeater in which the entanglement between two
neighboring repeater nodes was distributed using controlled displacements of
input coherent light, while the produced low-fidelity entangled pairs were
purified using ancillary (four-partite) entangled states. In this paper, the
entanglement distribution is realized using a sequence of controlled phase
shifts and displacements of input coherent light. Compared to previous
coherent-state-based distribution schemes for two-qubit entanglement, the
present scheme relies only upon a simple discrimination of two coherent states
with opposite signs, which can be performed in a quantum mechanically optimal
fashion via a beam splitter and two on-off detectors. The entanglement
purification utilizes a scheme that avoids the usage of ancillary entangled

the graphene waveguide formed by two parallel graphene monolayers, with an
insulator spacer layer. In this case, the eigenmodes supported by the
structure, such as surface plasmon and wave guided modes, provide decay
channels for the electric dipole placed close to the waveguide. We calculated
the contribution to the decay rate of symmetric and antisymmetric eigenmodes as
a function of frequency and the orientation of the emitter. Our results show
that the modification of the spontaneous emission due to excitation of guided
modes is much lower than the corresponding decays through the excitation of
symmetric and antisymmetric surface plasmons, for which, the spontaneous
emission is dramatically enhanced. As a consequence of the high confinement of
surface plasmons in the graphene waveguide, we found that the decay rate of the
emitter with vertical orientation (with respect to graphene sheets) is twice
the corresponding decay of the same emitter with parallel orientation in the
whole frequency range where surface plasmon modes exist. Differently from
metallo- dielectric structures, where structural parameters determine the range
and magnitude of this emission, our work shows that, by dynamically tuning the
chemical potential of graphene, the spectral region where the decay rate is
enhanced can be chosen over a wide range.

In the second of a series of papers, we use Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph
IFU data of 6 local (z<0.1) and moderate-luminosity Type 2 AGNs to study the
ionization properties and energetics of AGN-driven outflows. We find strong
evidence that connect the extreme kinematics of the ionized gas with the AGN
photoionization. The kinematic component related to the AGN-driven outflow is
clearly separated from other kinematic components, such as virial motions or
rotation, on the velocity and velocity dispersion diagram. Our spatially
resolved kinematic analysis reveals that from 30% up to 90% of the total mass
and kinetic energy of the outflow is contained within the central kpc of the
galaxy. The spatially integrated mass and kinetic energy of the gas entrained
in the outflow correlates well with the AGN bolometric luminosity and results
in energy conversion efficiencies between 0.01% and 1%. Intriguingly, we detect
ubiquitous signs of ongoing circumnuclear star formation. Their small size, the
centrally contained mass and energy, and the universally detected circumnuclear
star formation cast doubts on the potency of these AGN-driven outflows as
agents of galaxy-scale negative feedback.

apparent tension between the value of $H_0$ estimated from low and high
redshift observations such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation.
At the same time other observations have provided evidence of the existence of
local radial inhomogeneities extending in different directions up to a redshift
of about $0.07$. About $40\%$ of the Cepheids used for SN calibration are
directly affected because are located along the directions of these
inhomogeneities. We derive a new simple formula relating directly the
luminosity distance to the monopole of the density contrast, which does not
involve any metric perturbation. We then use it to develop a new inversion
method to reconstruct the monopole of the density field from the deviations of
the redshift uncorrected observed luminosity distance respect to the $\Lambda
CDM$ prediction based on cosmological parameters obtained from large scale
observations.
  The inversion method confirms the existence of inhomogeneities whose effects
were not previously taken into account because the $2M++$ density field maps
used to obtain the peculiar velocity for redshift correction were for $z\leq
0.06$, which is not a sufficiently large scale to detect the presence of
inhomogeneities extending up to $z=0.07$. The inhomogeneity does not affect the
high redshift luminosity distance because the volume averaged density contrast
tends to zero asymptotically, making the value of $H_0^{CMB}$ obtained from CMB
observations insensitive to any local structure. The inversion method can
provide a unique tool to reconstruct the density field at high redshift where
only SN data is available, and in particular to normalize correctly the density
field respect to the average large scale density of the Universe.

sub-interval of them, such as accomplishments, as well as metric constraints
about the length of intervals, that force, for instance, an interval to be at
least (resp., at most, exactly) k points long, can be expressed in AB.
Moreover, over the linear order of the natural numbers N, it subsumes the
(point-based) logic LTL, as it can easily encode the next and until modalities.
Finally, it is expressive enough to capture the {\omega}-regular languages,
that is, for each {\omega}-regular expression R there exists an AB formula
{\phi} such that the language defined by R coincides with the set of models of
{\phi} over N. It has been shown that the satisfiability problem for AB over N
is EXPSPACE-complete. Here we prove that, under the homogeneity assumption, its
model checking problem is {\Delta}^p_2 = P^NP-complete (for the sake of
comparison, the model checking problem for full HS is EXPSPACE-hard, and the
only known decision procedure is nonelementary). Moreover, we show that the
modality for the Allen relation Met-by can be added to AB at no extra cost
(AA'B is P^NP-complete as well).

nowcasting remains a challenge because most nowcasting systems are based on
linear extrapolation of radar reflectivity without much consideration for other
meteorological fields. The variational Doppler radar analysis system (VDRAS) is
an advanced convective-scale analysis system capable of providing analysis of
3-D wind, temperature, and humidity by assimilating Doppler radar observations.
Although potentially useful, it is still an open question as to how to use
these fields to improve nowcasting. In this study, we present results from our
first attempt at developing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Box-based nOWcasting
(SBOW) method under the machine learning framework using VDRAS analysis data.
The key design points of SBOW are as follows: 1) The study domain is divided
into many position-fixed small boxes and the nowcasting problem is transformed
into one question, i.e., will a radar echo > 35 dBZ appear in a box in 30
minutes? 2) Box-based temporal and spatial features, which include time trends
and surrounding environmental information, are elaborately constructed, and 3)
The box-based constructed features are used to first train the SVM classifier,
and then the trained classifier is used to make predictions. Compared with
complicated and expensive expert systems, the above design of SBOW allows the
system to be small, compact, straightforward, and easy to maintain and expand
at low cost. The experimental results show that, although no complicated
tracking algorithm is used, SBOW can predict the storm movement trend and storm
growth with reasonable skill.

diagnostic and therapeutic guidance in clinics. However, the {\it slow
acquisition} process, the dynamic deformation of organs, as well as the need
for {\it real-time} reconstruction, pose major challenges toward obtaining
artifact-free images. To cope with these challenges, the present paper
advocates a novel subspace learning framework that permeates benefits from
parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition of tensors (multiway data) to low-rank
modeling of temporal sequence of images. Treating images as multiway data
arrays, the novel method preserves spatial structures and unravels the latent
correlations across various dimensions by means of the tensor subspace.
Leveraging the spatio-temporal correlation of images, Tykhonov regularization
is adopted as a rank surrogate for a least-squares optimization program.
Alteranating majorization minimization is adopted to develop online algorithms
that recursively procure the reconstruction upon arrival of a new undersampled
$k$-space frame. The developed algorithms are {\it provably convergent} and
highly {\it parallelizable} with lightweight FFT tasks per iteration. To
further accelerate the acquisition process, randomized subsampling policies are
devised that leverage intermediate estimates of the tensor subspace, offered by
the online scheme, to {\it randomly} acquire {\it informative} $k$-space
samples. In a nutshell, the novel approach enables tracking motion dynamics
under low acquisition rates `on the fly.' GPU-based tests with real {\it in
vivo} MRI datasets of cardiac cine images corroborate the merits of the novel
approach relative to state-of-the-art alternatives.

what is the advantage of the two-layer cascade system over the one-layer

RECOS model. Then, the behavior of a two-layer RECOS system is analyzed and
compared with its one-layer counterpart. The LeNet-5 and the MNIST dataset are
used to illustrate discussion points. Finally, the RECOS model is generalized

phase-locked loops (PLLs). The performance of the PLLs is affected by the
non-ideal conditions in the sensed grid voltage such as harmonics, frequency
deviations and dc offsets in single-phase systems. In this paper, a
single-phase PLL is presented to mitigate the effects of these non-idealities.
This PLL is based on the popular second order generalized integrator (SOGI)
structure. The SOGI structure is modified to eliminate of the effects of input
dc offsets. The resulting SOGI structure has a high-pass filtering property.
Hence, this PLL is termed as high-pass generalized integrator based PLL
(HGI-PLL). It has fixed parameters which reduces the implementation complexity
and aids in the implementation in low-end digital controllers. The HGI-PLL is
shown to have least resource utilization among the SOGI based PLLs with dc
cancelling capability. Systematic design methods are evolved leading to the
design that limits the unit vector THD to within 1% for given non-ideal input
conditions in terms of frequency deviation and harmonic distortion. The
proposed designs achieve the fastest transient response. The performance of
this PLL has been verified experimentally. The results are found to agree with
the theoretical prediction.

While for structured domains, there exist intuitive definitions of signals and

two typical learning tasks. Although a variety of approaches have been proposed
to handle them, just a few of them are solved jointly, even so, these joint
methods do not yet specifically concern the semantic difference between human
gender and age, which is intuitively helpful for joint learning, consequently
leaving us a room of further improving the performance. To this end, in this
work we firstly propose a general learning framework for jointly estimating
human gender and age by specially attempting to formulate such semantic
relationships as a form of near-orthogonality regularization and then
incorporate it into the objective of the joint learning framework. In order to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we exemplify it by
respectively taking the widely used binary-class SVM for gender classification,
and two threshold-based ordinal regression methods (i.e., the discriminant
learning for ordinal regression and support vector ordinal regression) for age
estimation, and crucially coupling both through the proposed semantic
formulation. Moreover, we develop its kernelized nonlinear counterpart by
deriving a representer theorem for the joint learning strategy. Finally,
through extensive experiments on three aging datasets FG-NET, Morph Album I and
Morph Album II, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the
proposed joint learning strategy.

parameters of a network either ignore sensitivity of route decisions, require
route enumeration for parameterizing descriptive models of route selection, or
require complex bilevel models of route assignment behavior. These limitations
prevent modelers from fully exploiting ubiquitous data in monitoring
transportation networks. Inverse optimization methods that capture network
route choice behavior can address this gap, but they are designed to take
observations of the same model to learn the parameters of that model, which is
statistically inefficient (e.g. requires estimating population route and link
flows). New inverse optimization models and supporting algorithms are proposed
to learn the parameters of heterogeneous travelers' route behavior to infer
shared network state parameters (e.g. link capacity dual prices). The inferred
values are consistent with observations of each agent's optimization behavior.
We prove that the method can obtain unique dual prices for a network shared by
these agents in polynomial time. Four experiments are conducted. The first one,
conducted on a 4-node network, verifies the methodology to obtain heterogeneous
link cost parameters even when multinomial or mixed logit models would not be
meaningfully estimated. The second is a parameter recovery test on the
Nguyen-Dupuis network that shows that unique latent link capacity dual prices
can be inferred using the proposed method. The third test on the same network
demonstrates how a monitoring system in an online learning environment can be
designed using this method. The last test demonstrates this learning on real
data obtained from a freeway network in Queens, New York, using only real-time

properties for 197,096 Kepler targets observed between Quarters 1-17 (Q1-17),
which were used for the final transiting planet search run by the Kepler
Mission (Data Release 25, DR25). Similar to the Q1--16 catalog by Huber et al.
the classifications are based on conditioning published atmospheric parameters
on a grid of Dartmouth isochrones, with significant improvements in the adopted
methodology and over 29,000 new sources for temperatures, surface gravities or
metallicities. In addition to fundamental stellar properties the new catalog
also includes distances and extinctions, and we provide posterior samples for
each stellar parameter of each star. Typical uncertainties are ~27% in radius,
~17% in mass, and ~51% in density, which is somewhat smaller than previous
catalogs due to the larger number of improved logg constraints and the
inclusion of isochrone weighting when deriving stellar posterior distributions.
On average, the catalog includes a significantly larger number of evolved
solar-type stars, with an increase of 43.5% in the number of subgiants. We
discuss the overall changes of radii and masses of Kepler targets as a function
of spectral type, with particular focus on exoplanet host stars.

for Cooper pair tunneling to the exposed surface of TI. The use of magnetically
ordered dopants to break time-reversal symmetry may allow the surface of a TI
to host Majorana fermion, which are believed to be a signature of topological
superconductivity. In this work, we study a magnetically-doped thin film
TI-superconductor hybrid systems. Considering the proximity induced order
parameter in thin film of TI, we analyze the gap closing points of the
Hamiltonian and draw the phase diagram as a function of relevant parameters:
the hybridization gap, Zeeman energy, and chemical potential of the TI system.
Our findings provide a useful guide in choosing relevant parameters to
facilitate the observation of topological superconductivity in thin film

analysis on a TI proximity coupled to a s-wave superconductor and find that,
due to the spin-momentum locked nature of the surface states in TI, the induced

epidemiological and socio-economical interactions between individuals living in
highly distinct regional conditions. The level of exogenous reinfection and
first time infection rates within high-incidence settings may influence the
impact of control programs on TB prevalence. This study aims at enhancing the
understanding of TB dynamics via the study of scenarios, within {\it
simplified}, two patch, risk-defined environments, in the presence of short
term mobility and variations in reinfection and infection rates. The modeling
framework captures the role of individuals' `daily' dynamics within and between
places of residency, work or business via the proportion of time spent in
residence and as visitors to TB-risk environments (patches). As a result, the
{\it effective population size} of Patch $i$ (home of $i$-residents) at time
$t$ must account for visitors and residents of Patch $i$, at time $t$. The
impact that {\it effective population size} and the distribution of {\it
individuals' residence times} in different patches have on TB transmission and
control are studied using selected scenarios where risk is defined by the
estimated or perceive first time infection and/or exogenous re-infection rates.
Our results suggest that, under certain conditions, allowing infected
individuals to move from high to low TB prevalence areas (for example via the
sharing of treatment and isolation facilities) may lead to a reduction in the
total TB prevalence in the overall, here two-patch, population.

very special as its normal threshold and triangle singularities merge at about
4.45 GeV, generating a narrow and prominent peak in the amplitude in the case
that the $\chi_{c1}\, p$ is in an $S$-wave. We also see that loops with the
same charmonium and other $\Lambda^*$ hyperons produce less dramatic peaks from
the threshold singularity alone. For the case of $\chi_{c1}\, p \rightarrow

demonstrated explicitly for the example of three-dimensional topological
insulators. Their temperature and gate voltage-dependent Hall coefficient and
transverse magnetoresistance behavior, including the phenomenon of huge linear
transverse magnetoresistance, can be traced back to two conduction channels,
with fully determined carrier concentrations and mobilities. We further derive
an upper limit for the transverse magnetoresistance. Its violation implies
field dependences in the electronic band structure or scattering processes, or
the presence of more than two effective carrier types. Remarkably, none of the
three-dimensional topological insulators or semimetals with particularly large
transverse magnetoresistance violates this limit.

superposition of normal matter. Such superpositions are uniquely sensitive to
very small momentum transfers from new particles and forces, especially DM with
a mass below 100 MeV. Here we investigate what sorts of dark sectors are
inaccessible with existing methods but would induce noticeable decoherence in
the next generation of matter interferometers. We show that very soft, but
medium range (0.1 nm - 1 $\mu$m) elastic interactions between nuclei and DM are
particularly suitable. We construct toy models for such interactions, discuss
existing constraints, and delineate the expected sensitivity of forthcoming
experiments. The first hints of DM in these devices would appear as small
variations in the anomalous decoherence rate with a period of one sidereal day.
This is a generic signature of interstellar sources of decoherence, clearly
distinguishing it from terrestrial backgrounds. The OTIMA experiment under
development in Vienna will begin to probe Earth-thermalizing DM once sidereal
variations in the background decoherence rate are pushed below one part in a
hundred for superposed 5-nm gold nanoparticles. The proposals by Bateman et al.
and Geraci et al. could be similarly sensitive, although they would require at
least a month of data taking. DM that is absorbed or elastically reflected by
the Earth, and so avoids a greenhouse density enhancement, would not be
detectable by those three experiments. On the other hand, the aggressive
proposals of the MAQRO collaboration and Pino et al. would immediately open up
many orders of magnitude in DM mass, interaction range, and coupling strength,
regardless of how DM behaves in bulk matter.

employ model potentials which mimic finite-range s-wave interactions over a

$a_s \rightarrow \pm\infty$. Our results show that when the range is larger
than the 3D or 1D harmonic oscillator length scale, the eigenvalues and

zero, the results of contact potential as derived by Busch {\it et al.}
[Foundations of Physics, {\bf28}, 549 (1998)] are reproduced. However, in the
case of 1D, such reproducibility does not occur as the range goes to zero. We
have calculated the eigenvalues and eigenstates in 1D harmonic trap taking
one-dimensional finite- range model potential. We have also calculated bound
state properties of two particles confined in a highly anisotropic quasi-1D
trap taking three-dimensional finite-range model potential, and examined
whether these quasi-1D results approach towards 1D ones as the aspect ratio
$\eta$ of the radial to axial frequency of the trap increases. We find that if
the range is very small compared to the axial size of the trap, then one can
reach 1D regime for $\eta \ge 10000$. However, for large range, one can nearly
get 1D results for smaller values of $\eta$. This study will be important for
exploration of two-body or many body physics of trapped ultracold atoms

from the supercavity QED case to the waveguide QED case. Predictably, our

non-trivial atomic dynamics will in general be characterised also by a
non-trivial quantum information backflow, a clear signature of non-Markovian

atom, weakly coupled to a uniform coupled-cavity array (CCA). If initially
excited, in the absence of disorder, the emitter undergoes a Markovian
spontaneous emission by releasing all its excitation into the CCA (initially in
its vacuum state). By introducing static disorder in the CCA the field normal
modes become Anderson-localized, giving rise to a non-Markovian atomic
dynamics. We show the existence of a functional relationship between a rigorous
measure of quantum non-Markovianity and the CCA localization. We furthermore
show that the average non-Markovianity of the atomic dynamics is well-described

physics. Percolation theory provides a generic framework to study the behavior
of the cluster distribution. In most cases the theory predicts a geometrical
transition at the percolation threshold, characterized in the percolative phase
by the presence of a spanning cluster, which becomes infinite in the
thermodynamic limit. Standard percolation usually deals with the problem when
the constitutive elements of the clusters are randomly distributed. However
correlations cannot always be neglected. In this case correlated percolation is
the appropriate theory to study such systems. The origin of correlated
percolation could be dated back to 1937 when Mayer [1] proposed a theory to
describe the condensation from a gas to a liquid in terms of mathematical
clusters (for a review of cluster theory in simple fluids see [2]). The
location for the divergence of the size of these clusters was interpreted as
the condensation transition from a gas to a liquid. One of the major drawback
of the theory was that the cluster number for some values of thermodynamic
parameters could become negative. As a consequence the clusters did not have
any physical interpretation [3]. This theory was followed by Frenkel's
phenomenological model [4], in which the fluid was considered as made of non
interacting physical clusters with a given free energy. This model was later
improved by Fisher [3], who proposed a different free energy for the clusters,
now called droplets, and consequently a different scaling form for the droplet
size distribution. This distribution, which depends on two geometrical
parameters, has the nice feature that the mean droplet size exhibits a
divergence at the liquid-gas critical point.

it has been shown that increasing Ti doping dramatically influences the CDW by
breaking it into phase-shifted domains. Here, we report scanning tunneling

the CDW gap. Supported by density functional theory, we demonstrate that the
loss of the longrange phase coherence introduces an imbalance in the
intercalated-Ti site distribution and restrains the CDW gap closure. This local
resilient behavior of the $1T$-TiSe$_2$ CDW reveals a novel mechanism between
CDW and defects in mutual influence.

uses gauge fields on the gravity side which naturally realize the breaking of
Lorentz invariance. These gravity constructions often contain naked
singularities. In this thesis, we construct a resolution of the infra-red (IR)
singularity of the HSV background. The idea is to add squared curvature terms
to the Einstein-Maxwell dilaton action to build a flow from $\text{AdS}_4$ in
the ultra violate (UV) to an intermediating HSV region and then to an
$\text{AdS}_2 \times {\text{R}}^2$ region in the IR. This general solution is
free from the naked singularities and would be more appropriate for
applications of HSV in physical systems.
  We also study the Schwinger effect by using the AdS/CFT duality. We present
the phase diagrams of the Schwinger effect and also the ""butterfly shaped-phase
diagrams"" of the entanglement entropy for four different confining supergravity
backgrounds. Comparing different features of all of these diagrams could point
out to a potential relation between the Schwinger effect and the entanglement
entropy which could lead to a method of measuring entanglement entropy in the
laboratory.
  Finally, we study the ""new massive gravity"" theory and the different black
hole solutions it admits. We first present three different methods of
calculating the conserved charges. Then, by calculating the on-shell Gibbs free
energy we construct the Hawking-Page phase diagrams for different solutions in
two thermodynamical ensembles. As the massive gravity models are dual to
dissipating systems, studying the Hawking-Page diagrams could point out to
interesting results for the confinement-deconfinement phase transitions of the
dual boundary theories.

quantifying mixing as well as the rate of production of hybrid compositions in
the mixing system. The Shannon entropy approach is applied to time series
numerical simulations and high-temperature experiments performed with natural
melts. We note that in both cases the Shannon entropy increases linearly during
the initial stages of mixing and then saturates toward constant values.
Furthermore, chemical elements with different mobilities display different
rates of increase of the Shannon entropy. This indicates that the hybrid
composition for the different elements is attained at different times
generating a wide range of spatio-compositional domains which further increase
the apparent complexity of the mixing process. Results from the application of
the Shannon entropy analysis are compared with the concept of Relaxation of
Concentration Variance (RCV), a measure recently introduced in petrology to
quantify chemical exchanges during magma mixing. We derive a linear expression
relating the change of concentration variance during mixing and the Shannon
entropy. We show that the combined use of Shannon entropy and RCV provides the
most complete information about the space and time complexity of magma mixing.
As a consequence, detailed information about this fundamental petrogenetic and
volcanic process can be gathered. In particular, the Shannon entropy can be
used as complement to the RCV method to quantify the mobility of chemical
elements in magma mixing systems, to obtain information about the rate of
production of compositional heterogeneities, and to derive empirical
relationships linking the rate of chemical exchanges between interacting magmas
and mixing time.

consists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions,
parallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars
in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric
data set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The
second component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band
magnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of
~3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south
ecliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set
the typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and
about 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas
should be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000
Hipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more
precise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the
typical uncertainty of the positions is ~10 mas. The median uncertainties on
the mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to ~0.03 mag over the
magnitude range 5 to 20.7. Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping
of the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin
observational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this
first Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the
data quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions

algorithms for communication networks: if a node of this network has $x$
requests to transmit, then it receives a fraction of the capacity proportional
to $\log(1{+}L)$, the logarithm of its current load $L$. A stochastic model of
such an algorithm is investigated in the case of the star network, in which $J$
nodes can transmit simultaneously, but interfere with a central node $0$ in
such a way that node $0$ cannot transmit while one of the other nodes does. One
studies the impact of the log policy on these $J+1$ interacting communication
nodes. A fluid scaling analysis of the network is derived with the scaling
parameter $N$ being the norm of the initial state. It is shown that the
asymptotic fluid behaviour of the system is a consequence of the evolution of
the state of the network on a specific time scale $(N^t,\, t{\in}(0,1))$. The
main result is that, on this time scale and under appropriate conditions, the
state of a node with index $j\geq 1$ is of the order of $N^{a_j(t)}$, with
$0{\leq}a_j(t){<}1$, where $t\mapsto a_j(t)$ is a piecewise linear function.
Convergence results on the fluid time scale and a stability property are

investigation of the renormalization of the mixing angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
Here, we treat the renormalization of the mass parameter $m_{12}^2$ that softly
breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of the 2HDM Higgs sector. We investigate the
impact of two different renormalization schemes on the sample Higgs-to-Higgs
decay $H\to hh$. This decay also allows us to analyze the renormalization of
the mixing angles and to confirm the properties extracted before in other Higgs
decays. In conclusion we find that a gauge-independent, process-independent and
numerically stable renormalization of the 2HDM Higgs sector is given by the
application of the tadpole-pinched scheme for the mixing angles $\alpha$ and
$\beta$ and by the use of the $\overline{MS}$ scheme for $m_{12}^2$.

lowest conductance, attributed to an atom-size contact, below $\frac{2e^2}{h}$.
Our DFT calculations for monostrand chains anticipate that the $f$ bands are
fully spin polarized and insulating, and that the conduction may be dominated
by $s$, $p$, and $d$ bands. DFT quantum transport calculations quantitatively
reproduce the experimental results for zero bias and reveal that, while $s-p$

immerse within a 3D scene. This is possible by transmitting a set of reference
camera views (anchor views), which are used by the clients to freely navigate
in the scene and possibly synthesize additional viewpoints of interest. From a
networking perspective, the big challenge in IMVS systems is to deliver to each
client the best set of anchor views that maximizes the navigation quality,
minimizes the view-switching delay and yet satisfies the network constraints.
Integrating adaptive streaming solutions in free-viewpoint systems offers a
promising solution to deploy IMVS in large and heterogeneous scenarios, as long
as the multi-view video representations on the server are properly selected. We
therefore propose to optimize the multi-view data at the server by minimizing
the overall resource requirements, yet offering a good navigation quality to
the different users. We propose a video representation set optimization for
multiview adaptive streaming systems and we show that it is NP-hard. We
therefore introduce the concept of multi-view navigation segment that permits
to cast the video representation set selection as an integer linear programming
problem with a bounded computational complexity. We then show that the proposed
solution reduces the computational complexity while preserving optimality in
most of the 3D scenes. We then provide simulation results for different classes
of users and show the gain offered by an optimal multi-view video
representation selection compared to recommended representation sets (e.g.,
Netflix and Apple ones) or to a baseline representation selection algorithm
where the encoding parameters are decided a priori for all the views.

the use of the B1-WC hybrid functional, which provides very good agreement with
experimental data. The hypothetical high-symmetry cubic reference structure
combines several ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive (antipolar cation
motions, rotations and tilts of oxygen octahedra) structural instabilities. The
instability related to antipolar W motions combines with those associated to
oxygen rotations and tilts to produce the biggest energy reduction, yielding a
P21/c ground state. This non-polar P21/c phase is only different from the
experimentally reported Pc ground state by the absence of a very tiny
additional ferroelectric distortion. The calculations performed on a
stoichiometric compound so suggest that the low temperature phase of WO3 is not
intrinsically ferroelectric and that the reported ferroelectric character might
arise from extrinsic defects such as oxygen vacancies. Independently, we also
identify never observed R3m and R3c ferroelectric phases with large
polarizations and low energies close to the P 21/c ground state, which makes
WO3 a potential antiferroelectric material. The relative stability of various
phases is discussed in terms of the couplings between different structural
distortions, highlighting a very complex interplay involving improper-like
couplings up to fourth order in the energy expansion in the cubic phase.

an algorithmic-level model of causal structure learning under which learners

(bandwidth about 1 GHz) sub-second pulsations (temporal period range 0.07-1.49
s, no characteristic dominant period) lasted 70 s in the frequency range 4-7
GHz. These pulsations were not correlated at their individual frequencies, had
no measurable frequency drift, and zero polarization. In these pulsations, we
found the signatures of fast sausage magnetoacoustic waves with the
characteristic periods of 0.7 and 2 s. The other radio bursts showed their
characteristic frequency drifts in the range of -262-520 MHz/s. They helped us
to derive average values of 20-80 G for the coronal magnetic field strength in
the place of radio emission. It was revealed that the microwave event belongs
to an expanding coronal loop with twisted sub-structures observed in the 131,
94, and 193 A SDO/AIA channels. Their slit-time diagrams were compared with the
location of the radio source at 5.7 GHz to realize that the EUV intensity of
the expanding loop increased just before the radio source triggering. We reveal
two EUV bidirectional flows that are linked with the start time of the loop
expansion. Their positions were close to the radio source and propagated with
velocities within a range of 30-117 km/s. We demonstrate that periodic regime
of the electron acceleration in a model of the quasi-periodic magnetic
reconnection might be able to explain physical properties and behavior of the
sub-second pulsations. The depolarization process of the microwave emission
might be caused by a plasma turbulence in the radio source. Finally, the

concept of equilibrium is perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE). This is expressed
as a strategy and belief pair that simultaneously satisfy sequential
rationality and belief consistency. Unlike symmetric information dynamic games,
where subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) is the natural equilibrium concept, to
date there does not exist a universal algorithm that decouples the
interdependence of strategies and beliefs over time in calculating PBE. In this
paper we find a subset of PBE for an infinite horizon discounted reward
asymmetric information dynamic game. We refer to it as Structured PBE or SPBE;
in SPBE, any agents' strategy depends on the public history only through a
common public belief and on private history only through the respective agents'
latest private information (his private type). The public belief acts as a
summary of all the relevant past information and it's dimension does not
increase with time. The motivation for this comes the common information

(non-strategic) resource allocation problems with asymmetric information. We
calculate SPBE by solving a single-shot fixed-point equation and a

social policy. However, independent forecasts at the sub-national levels may
not add up to the forecasts at the national level. To address this issue, we
consider reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates, extending the
methods of Hyndman et al. (2011) to functional time series, where age is
considered as a continuum. The grouped functional time series methods are used
to produce point forecasts of mortality rates that are aggregated appropriately
across different disaggregation factors. For evaluating forecast uncertainty,
we propose a bootstrap method for reconciling interval forecasts. Using the
regional age-specific mortality rates in Japan, obtained from the Japanese
Mortality Database, we investigate the one- to ten-step-ahead point and
interval forecast accuracies between the independent and grouped functional
time series forecasting methods. The proposed methods are shown to be useful
for reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates at the national and

periodic instabilities in nematic liquid crystals, flexoelectric domains (FD)
and electroconvection (EC), was studied. The onset characteristics, threshold
voltages and critical wave vectors, were determined. We found that in general
the superposition of driving with different time symmetries inhibits the
pattern forming mechanisms for FD and EC as well. As a consequence the onset
extends to much higher voltages than the individual dc or ac thresholds. A dc
bias induced reduction of the crossover frequency from the conductive to the
dielectric EC regimes and a peculiar transition between two types of
flexodomains with different wavelengths were detected. Direct measurements of
the change of the electrical conductivity and its anisotropy, induced by the
applied dc voltage component, showed that the dc bias substantially affects
both parameters. Taking into account the experimentally detected variations of
the conductivity in the linear stability analysis of the underlying
nemato-hydrodynamic equations, a qualitative agreement with the experimental
findings on the onset behavior of spatially periodic instabilities was
obtained.

two-dimensional matrices (where the row and column order is not ignored) over a
finite alphabet is testable with a constant number of queries, by establishing
the following (ordered) matrix removal lemma: For any finite alphabet $\Sigma$,
any hereditary property $\mathcal{P}$ of matrices over $\Sigma$, and any
$\epsilon > 0$, there exists $f_{\mathcal{P}}(\epsilon)$ such that for any
matrix $M$ over $\Sigma$ that is $\epsilon$-far from satisfying $\mathcal{P}$,
most of the $f_{\mathcal{P}}(\epsilon) \times f_{\mathcal{P}}(\epsilon)$
submatrices of $M$ do not satisfy $\mathcal{P}$. Here being $\epsilon$-far from
$\mathcal{P}$ means that one needs to modify at least an $\epsilon$-fraction of
the entries of $M$ to make it satisfy $\mathcal{P}$.
  However, in the above general removal lemma, $f_{\mathcal{P}}(\epsilon)$
grows very fast as a function of $\epsilon^{-1}$, even when $\mathcal{P}$ is
characterized by a single forbidden submatrix. In this work we establish much
more efficient removal lemmas for several special cases of the above problem.
In particular, we show the following: For any fixed $s \times t$ binary matrix
$A$ and any $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ polynomial in $\epsilon$,
such that for any binary matrix $M$ in which less than a $\delta$-fraction of
the $s \times t$ submatrices are equal to $A$, there exists a set of less than
an $\epsilon$-fraction of the entries of $M$ that intersects every $A$-copy in
$M$.
  We generalize the work of Alon, Fischer and Newman [SICOMP'07] and make
progress towards proving one of their conjectures. The proofs combine their

combinatorial and probabilistic ideas.

of detecting and reveal piezo-charge generation through the direct
piezoelectric effect at the surface of the piezoelectric and ferroelectric
materials. We report the first nanoscale images of the charge generated in a
thick single crystal of Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) and a Bismuth
Ferrite (BiFO3) thin film by applying a force and recording the current
produced by the materials. The quantification of both d33 coefficients for PPLN
and BFO are 13 +- 2 pC/N and 46 +- 7 pC/N respectively, in agreement with the
values reported in the literature. This new mode can operate simultaneously
with PFM mode providing a powerful tool for the electromechanical and

varying shape, size and gap were fabricated using helium-ion lithography (HIL)
on an InGaN/GaN quantum well (QW) substrate. The influence of the array
geometry on plasmon-enhanced F\""orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from a
single InGaN QW to a ~ 80 nm layer of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) embedded in a
poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix is investigated. It is shown that the
energy transfer efficiency is strongly dependent on the array properties and an
efficiency of ~ 51% is observed for a nanoring array. There were no signatures
of FRET in the absence of the arrays. The QD acceptor layer emission is highly
sensitive to the array geometry. A model was developed to confirm that the
increase in the QD emission on the QW substrate compared with a GaN substrate
can be attributed solely to plasmon-enhanced FRET. The individual contributions
of direct enhancement of the QD layer emission by the array and the
plasmon-enhanced FRET are separated out, with the QD emission described by the
product of an array emission factor and an energy transfer factor. It is shown
that while the nanoring geometry results in an energy transfer factor of ~ 1.7
the competing quenching by the array, with an array emission factor of ~ 0.7,
results in only an overall gain of ~ 14% in the QD emission. The QD emission
was enhanced by ~ 71% for a nanobox array, resulting from the combination of a
more modest energy transfer factor of 1.2 coupled with an array emission factor
of ~ 1.4.

strength and structure at spatial resolution of $\sim1$ kpc. Highly polarized
emission from the southern tidal tail is detected with intrinsic fractional
polarization close to the theoretical maximum ($0.62\pm0.18$), estimated by
fitting the Faraday depolarization with a volume that is both synchrotron
emitting and Faraday rotating containing random magnetic fields. Magnetic
fields are well aligned along the tidal tail and the Faraday depths shows
large-scale smooth variations preserving its sign. This suggests the field in
the plane of the sky to be regular up to $\sim20$ kpc, which is the largest
detected regular field structure on galactic scales. The equipartition field
strength of $\sim8.5~\mu$G of the regular field in the tidal tail is reached
within a few 100 Myr, likely generated by stretching of the galactic disc field
by a factor of 4--9 during the tidal interaction. The regular field strength is

demonstrates, although the magnetic fields within the merging bodies are

The derivation transforms the nuclear Schrodinger equation (instead of the
Hamiltonian) to a rotating frame using a product wavefunction and imposing no
constraints on either the wavefunction or the nucleon motion. The difference
from Inglis model is that the frame rotation is driven by the motions of the
nucleons and not externally. Consequently, the transformed Schrodinger equation
is time-reversal invariant, and the total angular momentum is the sum of those
of the intrinsic system and rotating frame. In this article, we choose the
rotation of the frame to be given by a combination of rigid and irrotational
flows. The dynamic angular velocity of the rotating frame is determined by the
angular momentum of the frame and by a moment of inertia that is determined by
the nature of the flow combination. The intrinsic-system and rotating-frame
angular momenta emerge to have opposite signs. The angular momentum of the
rotating frame is determined from requiring the expectation of the total
angular momentum to have a given value. The transformed Schrodinger equation
has, in addition to the Coriolis energy term, a rigid-flow type kinetic energy
term that is absent from the conventional cranking model Schrodinger equation.
Ignoring the relatively small effect of the fluctuations in the angular
velocity and for a self-consistent deformed harmonic oscillator mean-field
potential, the resulting Schrodinger equation is solved for the ground-state
rotational band excitation energy and quadrupole moment in different
configurations of Ne-20 and the results are compared with those of the
conventional cranking model and empirical data.

the context of knowledge base construction and maintenance. It entails
processing a time-ordered stream of documents that might be relevant to an
entity in order to select only those that contain vital information.
State-of-the-art approaches to document filtering for popular entities are
entity-dependent: they rely on and are also trained on the specifics of
differentiating features for each specific entity. Moreover, these approaches
tend to use so-called extrinsic information such as Wikipedia page views and
related entities which is typically only available only for popular head
entities. Entity-dependent approaches based on such signals are therefore
ill-suited as filtering methods for long-tail entities. In this paper we
propose a document filtering method for long-tail entities that is
entity-independent and thus also generalizes to unseen or rarely seen entities.
It is based on intrinsic features, i.e., features that are derived from the
documents in which the entities are mentioned. We propose a set of features
that capture informativeness, entity-saliency, and timeliness. In particular,
we introduce features based on entity aspect similarities, relation patterns,
and temporal expressions and combine these with standard features for document
filtering. Experiments following the TREC KBA 2014 setup on a publicly
available dataset show that our model is able to improve the filtering
performance for long-tail entities over several baselines. Results of applying
the model to unseen entities are promising, indicating that the model is able
to learn the general characteristics of a vital document. The overall
performance across all entities---i.e., not just long-tail entities---improves
upon the state-of-the-art without depending on any entity-specific training
data.

bots. However, our knowledge of how these automated agents are interacting with

capacity for emotions, meaning-making, creativity, and sociality and it is
hence natural to expect interactions between bots to be relatively predictable

edit articles on Wikipedia. We track the extent to which bots undid each
other's edits over the period 2001-2010, model how pairs of bots interact over
time, and identify different types of interaction trajectories. We find that,
although Wikipedia bots are intended to support the encyclopedia, they often
undo each other's edits and these sterile ""fights"" may sometimes continue for
years. Unlike humans on Wikipedia, bots' interactions tend to occur over longer
periods of time and to be more reciprocated. Yet, just like humans, bots in
different cultural environments may behave differently. Our research suggests
that even relatively ""dumb"" bots may give rise to complex interactions, and
this carries important implications for Artificial Intelligence research.

a semimetal-to-semiconductor transition is observed as the emergence of an
energy band gap resulting from quantum confinement. Quantum confinement in a
semimetal results in either lifting of the degeneracy of the conduction and
valence bands in a zero gap semimetal, or shifting of bands with a negative
energy overlap to form conduction and valence bands. For semimetal nanowires
with diameters below 10 nanometer, the magnitude of the band gap can become
significantly larger than the thermal energy at room temperature resulting in a
new class of semiconductors relevant for nanoelectronics with critical
dimensions on the order of a few atomic lengths. The smaller a nanowire's
diameter, the larger its surface-to-volume ratio thus leading to an increasing
impact of surface chemistry on its electronic structure. Energy level shifts to
states in the vicinity of the Fermi level due to the electronegativity of
surface terminating species are shown to be comparable in magnitude to quantum
confinement effects at nanowire diameters of a few nanometer; these two effects
can be used to counteract one another leading to semimetallic behavior for
nanowire cross sections at which the quantum confinement effect would otherwise
dominate. Abruptly changing the surface terminating species along the length of
a nanowire leads to an abrupt change in the surface electronegativity. This can
result in the formation of a semimetal-semiconductor junction within a
monomaterial nanowire, without the need for impurity doping nor requiring the

operation and an interface connection operation, and formalize
composition-order invariance, which postulates that the order of composing and
connecting systems is irrelevant, a generalized form of associativity.
Composition-order invariance explicitly captures a common property that is
implicit in any context where one can draw a figure (hiding the drawing order)
of several connected systems, which appears in many scientific contexts. This
abstract algebra captures settings where one is interested in the behavior of a
composed system in an environment and wants to abstract away anything internal
not relevant for the behavior. This may include physical systems, electronic
circuits, or interacting distributed systems.
  One specific such setting, of special interest in computer science, are
functional system algebras, which capture, in the most general sense, any type
of system that takes inputs and produces outputs depending on the inputs, and
where the output of a system can be the input to another system. The behavior
of such a system is uniquely determined by the function mapping inputs to
outputs. We consider several instantiations of this very general concept. In
particular, we show that Kahn networks form a functional system algebra and
prove their composition-order invariance.
  Moreover, we define a functional system algebra of causal systems,
characterized by the property that inputs can only influence future outputs,
where an abstract partial order relation captures the notion of ""later"". This
system algebra is also shown to be composition-order invariant and appropriate
instantiations thereof allow to model and analyze systems that depend on time.

location of the best available trial state $\Psi_T$. The practical FN-DMC
approaches available for large systems rely on compact yet effective $\Psi_T$s
containing explicitly correlated single Slater determinant (SD). However, SD
nodes may be better suited to one system than to another, which may possibly
lead to inaccurate FN-DMC energy differences. It remains a challenge, how to
estimate inequivalency or appropriateness of SDs. Here we use the differences
of a measure based on Euclidean distance between the natural orbital occupation
number (NOON) vector of the Slater determinant (SD) from the exact solution in
the NOON vector space, that can be viewed as a measure of SD inequivalency and
a measure of the expected degree of nondynamic-correlation-related bias in
FN-DMC energy differences. This is explored on a set of small noncovalent
complexes and covalent bond breaking of Si$_2$ vs. N$_2$. It turns out that
NOON-based measures well reflect the magnitude and sign of the bias present in
the data available, thus providing new insights to the nature of bias

common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues, complete astrometric
single-star solutions are obtained by incorporating positional information from
the earlier catalogues. For other stars only their positions are obtained by
neglecting their proper motions and parallaxes. The results are validated by an
analysis of the residuals, through special validation runs, and by comparison
with external data. Results. For about two million of the brighter stars (down
to magnitude ~11.5) we obtain positions, parallaxes, and proper motions to
Hipparcos-type precision or better. For these stars, systematic errors
depending e.g. on position and colour are at a level of 0.3 milliarcsecond
(mas). For the remaining stars we obtain positions at epoch J2015.0 accurate to
~10 mas. Positions and proper motions are given in a reference frame that is
aligned with the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) to better than
0.1 mas at epoch J2015.0, and non-rotating with respect to ICRF to within 0.03
mas/yr. The Hipparcos reference frame is found to rotate with respect to the
Gaia DR1 frame at a rate of 0.24 mas/yr. Based on less than a quarter of the
nominal mission length and on very provisional and incomplete calibrations, the
quality and completeness of the astrometric data in Gaia DR1 are far from what
is expected for the final mission products. The results nevertheless represent
a huge improvement in the available fundamental stellar data and practical
definition of the optical reference frame.

become the most serious threat to worldwide apiculture. In the model presented
here we extend the bee population dynamics with mite viral epidemiology
examined in an earlier paper by allowing a bee-dependent mite population size.
The results of the analysis match field observations well and give a clear
explanation of how Varroa affects the epidemiology of certain naturally
occurring bee viruses, causing considerable damages to colonies. The model
allows only four possible stable equilibria, using known field parameters. The
first one contains only the thriving healthy bees. Here the disease is
eradicated and also the mites are wiped out. Alternatively, we find the
equilibrium still with no mite population, but with endemic disease among the
thriving bee population. Thirdly, infected bees coexist with the mites in the
Varroa invasion scenario; in this situation the disease invades the hive,
driving the healthy bees to extinction and therefore affecting all the bees.
Coexistence is also possible, with both populations of bees and mites thriving
and with the disease endemically affecting both species. The analysis is in
line with field observations in natural honey bee colonies. Namely, these
diseases are endemic and if the mite population is present, necessarily the
viral infection occurs. Further, in agreement with the fact that the presence
of Varroa increments the viral transmission, the whole bee population may
become infected when the disease vector is present in the beehive. Also, a low
horizontal transmission rate of the virus among the honey bees will help in
protecting the bee colonies from Varroa infestation and viral epidemics.

major bottleneck is still the read noise. To move from an industrial CMOS
sensor to one suitable for scientific applications, an improved design that
optimizes the noise level is essential. Here, we study the 1/f and thermal
noise performance of the source follower (SF) of a CMOS pixel in detail. We
identify the relevant design parameters, and analytically study their impact on
the noise level using the BSIM3v3 noise model with an enhanced model of gate
capacitance. Our detailed analysis shows that the dependence of the 1/f noise
on the geometrical size of the source follower is not limited to minimum
channel length, compared to the classical approach to achieve the minimum 1/f
noise. We derive the optimal gate dimensions (the width and the length) of the
source follower that minimize the 1/f noise, and validate our results using
numerical simulations. By considering the thermal noise or white noise along
with 1/f noise, the total input noise of the source follower depends on the
capacitor ratio CG/CFD and the drain current (Id). Here, CG is the total gate
capacitance of the source follower and CFD is the total floating diffusion
capacitor at the input of the source follower. We demonstrate that the optimum
gate capacitance (CG) depends on the chosen bias current but ranges from CFD/3
to CFD to achieve the minimum total noise of the source follower. Numerical
calculation and circuit simulation with 180nm CMOS technology are performed to

smaller than a specific scale. Surprise, a resolution-limit-free function
rooted in discrete probability theory, has been recently introduced and applied
to brain networks, revealing a wide size-distribution of functional modules, in
contrast with many previous reports. However, the use of Surprise is limited to
binary networks, while brain networks are intrinsically weighted, reflecting a
continuous distribution of connectivity strengths between different brain
regions. Here, we propose Asymptotical Surprise, a continuous version of
Surprise, for the study of weighted brain connectivity networks, and validate
this approach in synthetic networks endowed with a ground-truth modular
structure. We compare Asymptotical Surprise with leading community detection
methods currently in use and show its superior sensitivity in the detection of
small modules even in the presence of noise and intersubject variability such
as those observed in fMRI data. Finally, we apply our novel approach to
functional connectivity networks from resting state fMRI experimenta, and

Analysing 46 food webs of various kinds, we find that most food webs fall into

predicted by a global measure of hierarchical order in directed networks -
trophic coherence. We find that trophic coherence is also a good predictor for
the extent of omnivory, defined as the tendency of species to feed on multiple
trophic levels. We compare our results to a network assembly model that admits
tunable trophic coherence via a single free parameter. The model is able to
generate food webs in either of the two families by varying this parameter, and
correctly classifies almost all the food webs in our database. This establishes
a link between global order and local preying patterns in food webs.

reversible macroscopic changes in the wave propagation characteristics of
cellular metamaterials with soft microstructures. The proposed cellular
architecture is characterized by unit cells featuring auxiliary populations of
symmetrically-distributed smart cantilevers stemming from the nodal locations.
Through an external stimulus (the application of an electric field), we induce
extreme, localized, reversible curling deformation of the cantilevers---a shape
modification which does not affect the overall shape, stiffness and load
bearing capability of the structure. By carefully engineering the spatial
pattern of straight (non activated) and curled (activated) cantilevers, we can
induce several profound modifications of the phononic characteristics of the
structure: generation and/or shifting of total and partial bandgaps, cell
symmetry relaxation (which implies reconfigurable wave beaming), and chirality
switching. While in this work we discuss the specific case of composite
cantilevers with a PDMS core and active layers of electrostrictive terpolymer
P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE), the strategy can be extended to other smart materials (such
as dielectric elastomers or shape-memory polymers).

occurs when the electric field strength is above the critical value at which
the fields become non-linear with self-interactions (known as the Schwinger
limit). As the energy density of lasers approach the critical strength of 10^16
V/cm, the feasibility and functionality of electron-positron pair production
has received growing interest. Current laser intensities are approaching within
1 order of magnitude of the Schwinger limit. Processes for lowering the
critical energy density below the Schwinger limit through additional quantum
mechanical effects have been explored. One under study at the U. of Connecticut
and the U. of Duisburg-Essen is pulsation of inhomogeneous electric fields
within a carrier wave. Another is via enhancement of quantum effects by
addition of a magnetic field parallel to the electric field. Magnetic field
enhancement to quark/anti-quark production through chiral symmetry breaking
effects in QCD was considered by J. Preskill in the 1980's. S. Pyo and D. Page
showed in 2007 that parallel magnetic fields enhance electron/positron
production via an analogous QED effect. MAM production as a highly efficient
fuel source for intra solar system and interstellar propulsion was proposed by
D. Crow in 1983. The viability of this method of propulsion will be studied,
especially from the parallel electric and magnetic field approach.

Prandtl number and high Hartmann number support the possibility of a saturation
state characterized by helicity oscillations. We investigate the underlying
mechanism by analyzing this possibility using an higher-order Landau-Ginzburg
effective Lagrangian for the weakly non-linear amplitude dynamics, where the
magnetic and velocity perturbations are linearly dependent. We find that, if
the mirror symmetry between left- and right-handed modes is spontaneously
broken, it is impossible to achieve an oscillating helical state. We argue that
the result is likely to hold also adding higher-order terms and in the presence
of an explicit symmetry breaking. We conclude that an oscillating saturating
state for the Tayler instability is unlikely to depend on the interaction of
chiral modes.

based on a division of physical reality into a metric field (gravitation) on
the one hand, and into an electromagnetic field and matter on the other hand.
In reality space will probably be of a uniform character and the present theory
be valid only as a limiting case. For large densities of field and of matter,
the field equations and even the field variables which enter into them will
have no real significance.'. The dichotomy can be resolved by introducing a
scalar field/potential algebraically related to the Ricci tensor for which the
corresponding metric is free of additional singularities. Hence, although a
fundamentally nonlinear theory, the scalar field/potential provides an analytic
framework for interacting particles; described by linear superposition. The
stress tensor for the scalar field includes both the sources of and the
energy-momentum for the gravitational field, and has zero covariant and
ordinary divergence. Hence, the energy-momentum for the gravitational field and
sources are conserved. The theory's predictions agree with the experimental
results for General Relativity. By introducing the corresponding Lagrangian to
analytic mechanics, what is experimentally known for GR can be accounted for.

the shareholders, which are taxed individually. In 2014, a Chilean tax reform
introduced this type of entity and changed to an accrual basis that distributes
incomes (but not losses) to shareholders. A crucial step for the Chilean
taxation authority is to compute the final income of each individual, given the
complex network of corporations and companies, usually including cycles between
them. In this paper, we show the mathematical conceptualization and the
solution to the problem, proving that there is only one way to distribute
incomes to taxpayers. Using the theory of absorbing Markov chains, we define a
mathematical model for computing the taxable incomes of each taxpayer, and we
propose a decomposition algorithm for this problem. This allows us to compute
the solution accurately and with the efficient use of computational resources.
Finally, we present some characteristics of the Chilean taxpayers' network and
computational results of the algorithm using this network.
