processing units at the scale of their theoretic maximum performance reaching
access rates of 600 GB/s within read-and-write memory, and is further shown to
do so without compromising on image quality. The computation of X-ray
projections from discrete voxel grids is an ubiquitous task in many problems
related to volume image processing, including tomographic reconstruction and
visualization. Although its central role has given rise to numerous
publications discussing the optimal modeling of ray-volume intersections, a
unique benchmark in this respect does not exist. Here, a 3D Shepp-Logan phantom
is used, which allows the computation of analytic reference projections that
can further serve as input to iterative reconstructions without committing the
inverse crime. The proposed algorithm (GJP) is compared to the competing and
widely adopted digital differential analyzer (DDA), which computes exact
line-box intersections. It is thereby found to outperform the DDA on recent
graphics processors in all respects: Despite accessing twice as much memory,
the GJP is still able to calculate projections twice as fast. It further
exhibits considerably less discretization artifacts, and neither oversampling
of the DDA nor a smooth interpolation kernel within the GJP are able to improve
on these results in any respect.

different biological conditions. An essential step in an RNA-Seq study is
normalization, in which raw data are adjusted to account for factors that
prevent direct comparison of expression measures. Errors in normalization can
have a significant impact on downstream analysis, such as inflated false
positives in differential expression analysis. An under-emphasized feature of
normalization is the assumptions upon which the methods rely and how the
validity of these assumptions can have a substantial impact on the performance
of the methods. In this paper, we explain how assumptions provide the link
between raw RNA-Seq read counts and meaningful measures of gene expression. We
examine normalization methods from the perspective of their assumptions, as an
understanding of methodological assumptions is necessary for choosing methods
appropriate for the data at hand. Furthermore, we discuss why normalization
methods perform poorly when their assumptions are violated and how this causes
problems in subsequent analysis. To analyze a biological experiment,
researchers must select a normalization method with assumptions that are met
and that produces a meaningful measure of expression for the given experiment.

energy conservation for the envelope to compute in-situ planetary growth. We
consider different opacities and equations of state suited for a wide range of
metallicities. We find that envelope enrichment speeds up the formation of gas
giants. It also explains naturally the formation of low and intermediate mass
objects with large fractions of H-He (~ 20 - 30 % in mass). High opacity models
explain well the metallicity of the giant planets of the solar system, whereas
low opacity models are suited for forming small mass objects with thick H-He
envelopes and gas giants with sub-solar envelope metallicities. We find good
agreement between our models and the estimated water abundance for WASP-43b.
For HD 189733b, HD 209458b and WASP-12b we predict fractions of water larger
than what is estimated from observations, by at least a factor ~ 2. Envelope
enrichment by icy planetesimals is the natural scenario to explain the

are distributed in a corpus differently than non-informative terms. Different
statistical models (e.g. Poisson, geometric) are used to model the distribution
of non-informative terms, producing different DFR models. An informative term
is then detected by measuring the divergence of its distribution from the
distribution of non-informative terms. However, there is little empirical
evidence that the distributions of non-informative terms used in DFR actually
fit current datasets. Practically this risks providing a poor separation
between informative and non-informative terms, thus compromising the
discriminative power of the ranking model. We present a novel extension to DFR,
which first detects the best-fitting distribution of non-informative terms in a
collection, and then adapts the ranking computation to this best-fitting
distribution. We call this model Adaptive Distributional Ranking (ADR) because
it adapts the ranking to the statistics of the specific dataset being processed

imply a low number density, making direct detection very challenging. The
strongest limits come from the existence of neutron stars because, if a
baryonic $Q$-ball is captured by a neutron star, the $Q$-ball can absorb the
baryon number releasing energy and eventually destroying a neutron star.
However, in the presence of baryon number violating higher-dimension operators,
the growth of a $Q$-ball inside a neutron star is hampered once the $Q$-ball
reaches a certain size. We re-examine the limits and identify some classes of

of a protein toxin by an sRNA antitoxin. Here, we focus on the nonlinear nature
of the regulatory circuit dynamics of the toxin-antitoxin mechanism. The
mechanism relies on a transient increase in protein concentration rather than
on the steady state of the genetic circuit. Through a systematic analysis of
the parameter dependence of this transient increase, we confirm some known
design features of this system and identify new ones: for an efficient
toxin-antitoxin mechanism, the synthesis rate of the toxin's mRNA template
should be lower that of the sRNA antitoxin, the mRNA template should be more
stable than the sRNA antitoxin, and the mRNA-sRNA complex should be more stable
than the sRNA antitoxin. Moreover, a short half-life of the protein toxin is
also beneficial to the function of the toxin-antitoxin system. In addition, we
study a therapeutic scenario in which a competitor mRNA is introduced to
sequester the sRNA antitoxin, causing the toxic protein to be expressed.

resolving an open question of Srebro (2007). Our second main result shows that
the EM algorithm (or a first-order variant of it) with random initialization

$1-e^{-\Omega(M)}$. We further establish that a first-order variant of EM will
not converge to strict saddle points almost surely, indicating that the poor

regarded as a universal law of biology. However, it is well known that cell
cultures do not obey this law. The current thinking is that were in-vitro
cultures to obey quarter power scaling, they would have more predictive power
and could for instance provide a viable substitute for animals in research.
About two decades ago, West and coworkers established a model which predicts
that metabolic rate follows a quarter power relationship with the mass of an
organism, based on the premise that tissues are supplied nutrients through a
fractal distribution network. This paper outlines a theoretical and
computational framework for establishing quarter power scaling in-vitro,
starting where fractal distribution ends. Allometric scaling in non-vascular
spherical tissue constructs was assessed using models of Michaelis Menten
oxygen consumption and diffusion. The results demonstrate that physiological
scaling is maintained when about 5 to 60% of the construct is exposed to oxygen
concentrations less than the Michaelis Menten constant. In these conditions the
Thiele modulus is between 8 and 80, with a significant concentration gradient
in the sphere. The results have important implications for the design of
downscaled in-vitro systems with physiological relevance.

2MASS are used to identify potential young objects in the region. Those
identified in the bands of WISE would be contaminated by the emission of PAHs.
We use the emission distribution in the infrared at 70 and 160 microns, to
estimate the dust temperature gradient. This suggests that the nearby massive

contributing to the photodissociation of the molecular gas and to the heating

  In this paper, we explore visibility numbers of trees when the vertices are

visibility: when lines of sight can be parallel to any standard basis vector of

$G_g$. The resulting symmetric gauge theories are dubbed ""symmetry-enriched

theories of three-dimensional symmetric topological quantum spin liquids. We
focus on $\mathsf{SEG}$s with gauge group
$G_g=\mathbb{Z}_{N_1}\times\mathbb{Z}_{N_2}\times\cdots$ and on-site unitary
symmetry group $G_s=\mathbb{Z}_{K_1}\times\mathbb{Z}_{K_2}\times\cdots$ or
$G_s=\mathrm{U(1)}\times \mathbb{Z}_{K_1}\times\cdots$. Each
$\mathsf{SEG}(G_g,G_s)$ is described in the path integral formalism associated
with certain symmetry assignment. From the path-integral expression, we propose
how to physically diagnose the ground state properties (i.e., $\mathsf{SET}$
orders) of $\mathsf{SEG}$s in experiments of charge-loop braidings (patterns of
symmetry fractionalization) and the \emph{mixed} multi-loop braidings among
deconfined loop excitations and confined symmetry fluxes. From these
symmetry-enriched properties, one can obtain the map from $\mathsf{SEG}$s to
$\mathsf{SET}$s. By giving full dynamics to background gauge fields,
$\mathsf{SEG}$s may be eventually promoted to a set of new gauge theories
(denoted by $\mathsf{GT}^*$). Based on their gauge groups, $\mathsf{GT}^*$s may
be further regrouped into different classes each of which is labeled by a gauge
group ${G}^*_g$. Finally, a web of gauge theories involving $\mathsf{GT}$,
$\mathsf{SEG}$, $\mathsf{SET}$ and $\mathsf{GT}^*$ is achieved. We demonstrate
the above symmetry-enrichment physics and the web of gauge theories through
many concrete examples.

this instrument plays an important role in reaching the scientific goals of The
Atmospheric and Space Science Coordination (CEA) at the Brazilian National
Institute for Space Research (INPE). In particular, the CEA's space weather

SThM, both as obtained after conventional thermal reduction and after a
subsequent annealing at 1700{\deg}C. Significant differences in the thermal
maps were observed between pristine and annealed flakes, reflecting higher heat
dissipation on annealed RGO flakes compared with pristine ones. This result was
correlated with the reduction of RGO structure defectiveness. In particular, a
substantial reduction of oxidized groups and sp3 carbons upon annealing was
proven by X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopies, while the increase of
crystalline order was demonstrated by X-ray diffraction, in terms of higher
correlation lengths both along and perpendicular to the graphene planes.
Results presented in this paper provide experimental evidence for the
qualitative correlation between the defectiveness of graphene-related materials
and their thermal conductivity, which is clearly crucial for the exploitation

  Connectome",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human brain dynamics can be profitably viewed through the lens of statistical
mechanics, where neurophysiological activity evolves around and between local
attractors representing preferred mental states. Many physically-inspired
models of these dynamics define the state of the brain based on instantaneous
measurements of regional activity. Yet, recent work in network neuroscience has
provided initial evidence that the brain might also be well-characterized by
time-varying states composed of locally coherent activity or functional
modules. Here we study this network-based notion of brain state to understand
how functional modules dynamically interact with one another to perform
cognitive functions. We estimate the functional relationships between regions
of interest (ROIs) by fitting a pair-wise maximum entropy model to each ROI's
pattern of allegiance to functional modules. Local minima in this model
represent attractor states characterized by specific patterns of modular
structure. The clustering of local minima highlights three classes of ROIs with
similar patterns of allegiance to community states. Visual, attention,
sensorimotor, and subcortical ROIs tend to form a single functional community.
The remaining ROIs tend to form a putative executive control community or a
putative default mode and salience community. We simulate the brain's dynamic
transitions between these community states using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
random walk. We observe that simulated transition probabilities between basins
resemble empirically observed transitions between community allegiance states
in resting state fMRI data. These results collectively offer a view of the
brain as a dynamical system that transitions between basins of attraction
characterized by coherent activity in small groups of brain regions, and that
the strength of these attractors depends on the cognitive computations being
performed.

from DM relic density, direct and indirect detection, and invisible Higgs
decays, we find three possible regions of DM mass $M_{s_1}$ that can survive
the present and even the future experiments: (1) the Higgs resonance region
with $M_{s_1}\sim M_h/2$, (2) the Higgs region with $M_{s_1}\sim M_h$, and (3)
the coannihilation region with $M_{s_2}\sim M_{s_1}$. Here $s_{1,2}$ are two
scalar singlets with the lighter $s_1$ being the DM candidate. Based on DM
properties and direct collider constraints, we choose three benchmark points to
illustrate the testability of this model at LHC. We perform a detailed
simulation of the four-lepton and tri-lepton signatures at 13 (14) TeV LHC.
While both signatures are found to be promising at all benchmark points, the
tri-lepton one is even better: it is possible to reach the $5\sigma$
significance with an integrated luminosity of 100/fb.

approximate solutions to Global Polynomial Optimization (GPO) problems with

  The algorithm is based on a combination of SOS/Moment relaxations and
successively bisecting a hyper-rectangle containing the feasible set of the GPO
problem. At each iteration, the algorithm makes a comparison between the volume
of the hyper-rectangles and their associated lower bounds to the GPO problem
obtained by SOS/Moment relaxations to choose and subdivide an existing
hyper-rectangle. For any desired accuracy, if we use sufficiently large order
of SOS/Moment relaxations, then the algorithm is guaranteed to return a
suboptimal point in a certain sense. For a fixed order of SOS/Moment
relaxations, the complexity of the algorithm is linear in the number of
iterations and polynomial in the number of constrains. We illustrate the
effectiveness of the algorithm for a 6-variable, 5-constraint GPO problem for
which the ideal generated by the equality constraints is not zero-dimensional -
a case where the existing Moment-based approach for extracting the global
minimizer might fail.

to construct low dimensional summary statistics for ABC. The proposed method
identifies a sufficient subspace of the original summary statistics by
implicitly considers all nonlinear transforms therein, and a weighting kernel
is used for the concentration of the projections. No strong assumptions are
made on the marginal distributions nor the regression model, permitting usage
in a wide range of applications. Experiments are done with both simple

that assigns to every nondegenerate form the so-called associated form lying in
the space ${\mathbb C}[y_1,\dots,y_n]_{n(d-1)}$. One of the reasons for our
interest in $A$ is the conjecture---motivated by the well-known Mather-Yau
theorem on complex isolated hypersurface singularities---asserting that all
regular ${\mathrm {GL}}_n$-invariant functions on the affine open subvariety
${\mathbb C}[x_1,\dots,x_n]_{d+1,\Delta}$ of forms with nonvanishing

optimal trade-off between the measure of privacy infringement and the expected

participant stops broadcasting its position, is proposed. The algorithm
searches over a family of policies in which an agent stops transmitting its
position measurements if its distance (in terms of the number of hops) to the
privacy sensitive node is smaller than a prescribed threshold. Employing such
symmetric policies are advantageous in terms of the resources required for
implementation and the ease of computation. The results are expanded to more
general policies. Further, the effect of the heterogeneity of the population
density on the optimal policy is explored. Finally, the relationship between
the betweenness measure of centrality and the optimal privacy-preserving policy

Fermi arcs at certain surfaces. We review our recent works on quantum transport
in topological semimetals, according to the strength of the magnetic field. At
weak magnetic fields, there are competitions between the positive

expect that the weak localization may by induced by inter- alley effects and
interaction effect, and occur in double-Weyl semimetals. For the negative
magnetoresistance induced by the nontrivial Berry curvature in topological
semimetals, we show the dependence of the negative magnetoresistance on the
carrier density. At strong magnetic fields, specifically, in the quantum limit,
the magnetoconduction depends on the type and range of the scattering potential
of disorder. The high-field positive magnetoconductivity may not be a
compelling signature of the chiral anomaly. For long-range Gaussian scattering
potential and half filling, the magnetoconductivity can be linear in the

that quantum states exhibiting time-invariant entanglement must live in both

studies on this feature for two qubits can be recovered from our studies as a

coupling present in many TI thin films is needed, and again, the topology can
be tuned by electric field or doping. Notably, we find that the required
inter-surface pairing strength for achieving nontrivial topology can still be
subdominant compared to the intra-surface pairing. Finally, for spin-triplet
inter-surface pairing we prove that the superconducting state is always
topological nontrivial. We show that thin films of Cu-doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$ will
likely host such spin-triplet inter-surface pairing. Taken together, these

waste sorting business.
  By extending previous active learning approaches to grasping, we show a
system that learns the task autonomously. Instead of predicting just whether a
grasp succeeds, we predict the classes of the objects that end up being picked
and thrown onto the target conveyor. Segmenting and identifying objects from
the uncluttered target conveyor, as opposed to the working area, is easier due
to the added structure since the thrown objects will be the only ones present.
  Instead of trying to segment or otherwise understand the cluttered working
area in any way, we simply allow the controller to learn a mapping from an RGBD
image in the neighborhood of the grasp to a predicted result---all segmentation
etc. in the working area is implicit in the learned function. The grasp
selection operates in two stages: The first stage is hardcoded and outputs a
distribution of possible grasps that sometimes succeed. The second stage uses a
purely learned criterion to choose the grasp to make from the proposal
distribution created by the first stage.
  In an experiment, the system quickly learned to make good pickups and predict
correctly, in advance, which class of object it was going to pick up and was
able to sort the objects from a densely cluttered pile by color.

utilizing different types of molecule for different nodes. As a result, this
proposal of homogeneous molecular relaying remarkably improves the resource
reuse capability. This paper generically characterizes the transmission and
detection strategies of the proposed scheme. Moreover, we derive the analytical
bit error probabilities for the multiple access and broadcast phases and

to compute a new postprocessed velocity, which is exactly divergence free and
has a superconvergence property. This strongly divergence free velocity field
is the key to the mass conservation. Furthermore, energy stability is improved
by the skew-symmetric discretization of the convection term. We will present

biparametric acceleration with components along the tangential and normal
directions. A similarity transformation reduces the biparametric disturbance to
a simpler uniparametric forcing along the velocity vector. The solvability

similar properties to those of the objective functions in typical Bayesian

prevents gradient computation), their evaluation is considered to be very
expensive, and the resulting observations may be corrupted by noise. These
constraints arise in a plethora of expensive black-box optimization problems.
We carry out synthetic experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of PESMOC,

plasma from the circumstellar disc accretes onto the stellar surface with free
fall velocity, and the impact generates a shock. The impact region is expected
to contribute to emission in different spectral bands; many studies have
confirmed that the X-rays arise from the post-shock plasma but, otherwise,
there are no studies in the literature investigating the origin of the observed
UV emission which is apparently correlated to accretion. Aims. We investigated
the effect of radiative heating of the infalling material by the post-shock
plasma at the base of the accretion stream with the aim to identify in which
region a significant part of the UV emission originates. Methods. We developed
a 1D hydrodynamic model describing the impact of an accretion stream onto the
stellar surface; the model takes into account the gravity, the radiative
cooling of an optically thin plasma, the thermal conduction, and the heating
due to absorption of X-ray radiation. The latter term represents the heating of
the infalling plasma due to the absorption of X-rays emitted from the
post-shock region. Results. We found that the radiative heating of the
pre-shock plasma plays a non-negligible role in the accretion phenomenon. In
particular, the dense and cold plasma of the pre-shock accretion column is
gradually heated up to few $10^5$\;K due to irradiation of X-rays arising from
the shocked plasma at the impact region. This heating mechanism does not affect
significantly the dynamics of the post-shock plasma. On the other hand, a
region of radiatively heated gas (that we consider a precursor) forms in the
unshocked accretion column and contributes significantly to UV emission. Our
model naturally reproduces the luminosity of UV emission lines correlated to
accretion and shows that most of the UV emission originates from the precursor.

outwards, from ~0.04 to ~0.02, comparable to values measured in the Milky Way

~3x10^-15 s^-1, respectively, which are slightly higher than in the Milky Way

formation activity in the z=0.89 absorber. The ALMA observations of OH+, H2O+,

around 100 TeV in the cosmic-ray proton spectrum. Here we propose that the
gamma-ray emission from the inner and the outer regions may be explained
self-consistently by run-away protons from a single, yet fading accelerator. In
this model, gamma rays from the CMZ region are produced by protons injected in
the past, while gamma rays from the inner region are produced by protons
injected more recently. We suggest that the blast wave formed in a tidal
disruption event (TDE) caused by the supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) could
serve as such a fading accelerator. With typical parameters of the TDE blast
wave, gamma-ray spectra of both the CMZ region and HESS J1745-290 can be
reproduced simultaneously. Meanwhile, we find that the cosmic-ray energy
density profile in the CMZ region may also be reproduced in the fading

the photometric rotation periods of components of multiple stellar systems and
look for correlations of the period differences among the components to their
reciprocal distances. In this paper, we analysed the triple system AU Mic + AT
Mic A&B in the 25-Myr beta Pictoris Association. We have retrieved from the
literature the rotation period of AU Mic (P = 4.85d) and measured from
photometric archival data the rotation periods of both components of AT Mic (P
= 1.19d and P = 0.78d) for the first time. Moreover, we detected a high rate of
flare events from AT Mic. Whereas the distant component AU Mic has evolved
rotationally as a single star, the A and B components of AT Mic, separated by
about 27 AU, exhibit a rotation rate a factor 5 larger than AU Mic. Moreover,
the A and B components, despite have about equal mass, show a significant
difference (about 40%) between their rotation periods. A possible explanation
is that the gravitational forces between the A and B components of AT Mic (that
are a factor about 7.3 x 10^6 more intense than those between AU Mic and AT
Mic) have enhanced the dispersal of the AT Mic primordial disc, shortening its
lifetime and the disc-locking phase duration, making the component A and B of
AT Mic to rotate faster than the more distant AU Mic. We suspect that a
different level of magnetic activity between the A and B components of AT Mic

well-known subset sum problem. Given a node-weighted digraph, select a subset
of vertices whose total weight does not exceed a given budget. Some additional
constraints need to be satisfied. The (weak resp.) digraph constraint imposes
that if (all incoming nodes of resp.) a node $x$ belongs to the solution, then
the latter comprises all its outgoing nodes (node $x$ itself resp.). The
maximality constraint ensures that a solution cannot be extended without
violating the budget or the (weak) digraph constraint. We study the complexity
of these problems and we present some approximation results according to the

different observation time, requires the data fusion technology. In this paper
we introduce the cross-match tool that is developed by the Python language and
based on the PostgreSQL database and uses Q3C as the core index, facilitating
the cross-match work of massive astronomical data. It provides four different
cross-match functions, namely: I) cross-match of custom error range; II)
cross-match of catalog error; III) cross-match based on the elliptic error
range; IV) cross-match of the nearest algorithm. The cross-match result set
provides good foundation for subsequent data mining and statistics based on
multiwavelength data. The most advantage of this tool is a user-oriented tool
applied locally by users. By means of this tool, users may easily create their
own databases, manage their own data and cross-match databases according to
their requirements. In addition, this tool is also able to transfer data from
one database into another database. More importantly, the tool is easy to get
started and used by astronomers without writing any code.

structure. Many of which can be associated to interactions with nearby moons
and moonlets. Possibly the most interesting and dynamic place in the rings,
probably in the whole Solar System, is the F ring. A highly disrupted ring with
large asymmetries both radially and azimuthally. Numerically non zero
components to the curl of the velocity vector field (vorticity) in the
perturbed area of the F ring post encounter are witnessed, significantly above
the background vorticity. Within the perturbed area rich distributions of local
rotations is seen located in and around the channel edges. The gravitational
scattering of ring particles during the encounter causes a significant elevated
curl of the vector field above the background F ring vorticity for the first
1-3 orbital periods post encounter. After 3 orbital periods vorticity reverts
quite quickly to near background levels. This new found dynamical vortex life
of the ring will be of great interest to planet and planetesimals in
proto-planetary disks where vortices and turbulence are suspected of having a
significant role in their formation and migrations. Additionally, it is found
that the immediate channel edges created by the close passage of Prometheus
actually show high radial dispersions in the order ~20-50 cm/s, up to a maximum
of 1 m/s. This is much greater than the value required by Toomre for a disk to
be unstable to the growth of axisymmetric oscillations. However, an area a few

A notable example
is the HST-1 knot in M87. Such features are commonly interpreted as
re-confinement shocks in hydrodynamic jets or focusing nozzles in Poynting
jets. In this paper we compute the structure and Lorentz factor of a highly
magnetized jet confined by external pressure having a profile that flattens
abruptly at some radius. We find the development of strong oscillations upon
transition from the steeper to the flatter pressure profile medium. Analytic
formula is derived for the location of the nodes of these oscillations. We
apply the model to the M87 jet and show that if the jet remains magnetically
dominated up to sub-kpc scales, then focusing is expected. The location of the
HST-1 knot can be reconciled with recent measurements of the pressure profile
around the Bondi radius if the jet luminosity satisfies $L_j\simeq10^{43}$
erg/s. However, we find that magnetic domination at the collimation break
implies a Lorentz factor in excess of $10^2$, atypical to FRI sources. A much
lower value of the asymptotic Lorentz factor would require substantial loading
close to the black hole. In that case HST-1 may be associated with a
collimation nozzle of a hydrodynamic flow.

QSO B0218+357 is a gravitationally lensed blazar located at a
redshift of 0.944. The gravitational lensing splits the emitted radiation into
two components, spatially indistinguishable by gamma-ray instruments, but
separated by a 10-12 day delay. In July 2014, QSO B0218+357 experienced a
violent flare observed by the Fermi-LAT and followed by the MAGIC telescopes.
Aims. The spectral energy distribution of QSO B0218+357 can give information on
the energetics of z ~ 1 very high energy gamma- ray sources. Moreover the
gamma-ray emission can also be used as a probe of the extragalactic background
light at z ~ 1. Methods. MAGIC performed observations of QSO B0218+357 during
the expected arrival time of the delayed component of the emission. The MAGIC
and Fermi-LAT observations were accompanied by quasi-simultaneous optical data
from the KVA telescope and X-ray observations by Swift-XRT. We construct a
multiwavelength spectral energy distribution of QSO B0218+357 and use it to
model the source. The GeV and sub-TeV data, obtained by Fermi-LAT and MAGIC,
are used to set constraints on the extragalactic background light. Results.
Very high energy gamma-ray emission was detected from the direction of QSO
B0218+357 by the MAGIC telescopes during the expected time of arrival of the
trailing component of the flare, making it the farthest very high energy
gamma-ray sources detected to date. The observed emission spans the energy
range from 65 to 175 GeV. The combined MAGIC and Fermi-LAT spectral energy
distribution of QSO B0218+357 is consistent with current extragalactic
background light models. The broad band emission can be modeled in the
framework of a two zone external Compton scenario, where the GeV emission comes
from an emission region in the jet, located outside the broad line region.

capacitance of a two-subband system is sensitive to a redistribution of

quantization, one of the quantum mechanisms proposed for the resistance
oscillations.

infection rates between different pairs of nodes are different. Researchers
have discussed whether the mean-field approaches could accurately describe the
epidemic spreading for the homogeneous cases but not for the heterogeneous
cases. In this paper, we explore under what conditions the mean-field approach
could perform well when the infection rates are heterogeneous. In particular,
we employ the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model and compare the
average fraction of infected nodes in the metastable state obtained by the
continuous-time simulation and the mean-field approximation. We concentrate on
an individual-based mean-field approximation called the N-intertwined Mean
Field Approximation (NIMFA), which is an advanced approach considered the
underlying network topology. Moreover, we consider not only the independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) infection rate but also the infection rate
correlated with the degree of the two end nodes. We conclude that NIMFA is
generally more accurate when the prevalence of the epidemic is higher. Given
the same effective infection rate, NIMFA is less accurate when the variance of
the i.i.d.\ infection rate or the correlation between the infection rate and
the nodal degree leads to a lower prevalence. Moreover, given the same actual
prevalence, NIMFA performs better in the cases: 1) when the variance of the
i.i.d.\ infection rates is smaller (while the average is unchanged); 2) when
the correlation between the infection rate and the nodal degree is positive.

inversions of the observed Stokes profiles with the help of the SIR code. We
follow these regions during their lifetime to study their temporal behavior.
Finally, we carry out a statistical analysis of the detected supersonic

contained in compact patches moving outward, which are located in the mid and
outer penumbra. They are observed as bright, roundish structures at the outer
end of penumbral filaments that resemble penumbral grains. The patches may
undergo fragmentations and mergings during their lifetime, even some of them

vertical magnetic fields with a reversed polarity compared to that of the

produce a shock. Consequently, this shock enhances the temperature and is
detected as a bright grain in the continuum filtergrams, which could explain

supports the previous assertion that intense reflection peaks measured with a
large numerical aperture provide a faithful signature of the 3D photonic band
gap. The Bragg attenuation lengths $L_{B}$ exceed the earlier estimates based
on the width of the stop band by a factor $6$ to $9$. Hence crystals with a
thickness of $12$ unit cells studied in experiments are in the thick crystal
limit ($L >> L_{B}$). In our calculations for p-polarized waves, we also
observe an intriguing hybridization of the zero reflection of Fabry-P{\'e}rot
fringes and the Brewster angle, which has not yet been observed in experiments.

in the density and velocity fields grow, and the system evolves via formation
of clusters in the density field and the local ordering of velocity field,
consistent with the onset of plug flow. This is accompanied by a transition of
the velocity distribution function from MB to non-MB behaviour. We used
equal-time correlation functions and structure factors of the density and

higher dimensions, and many different approaches have been tried. We replace
the English text symbol sequence originally used to illustrate the theory by a

derive a new and symmetric version of the second order entropy in 1D. The new
theory then naturally extends to 2D and higher dimensions, where by naturally
we mean simple, symmetric, isotropic and parsimonious. Simplicity arises from
the direct application of Shannon's joint entropy equalities and inequalities
to the gradient (del) vector field image embodying the second order relations
of the scalar image. Parsimony is guaranteed by halving of the vector data rate
using Papoulis' generalized sampling expansion. The new 2D entropy measure,
which we dub delentropy, is underpinned by a computable probability density
function we call deldensity. The deldensity captures the underlying spatial
image structure and pixel co-occurrence. It achieves this because each scalar
image pixel value is nonlocally related to the entire gradient vector field.
Both deldensity and delentropy are highly tractable and yield many interesting
connections and useful inequalities. The new measure explicitly defines a
realizable encoding algorithm and a corresponding reconstruction. Initial tests
show that delentropy compares favourably with the conventional intensity-based
histogram entropy and the compressed data rates of lossless image encoders

three stages: (1) clustering an estimated correlation network of the studies,
(2) learning replicability (e.g., of genes) within clusters, and (3) merging
the results across the clusters using dynamic programming. We applied SCREEN to
two real datasets and demonstrated that it greatly outperforms the results
obtained via standard meta-analysis. First, on a collection of 29 case-control
large-scale gene expression cancer studies, we detected a large up-regulated
module of genes related to proliferation and cell cycle regulation. These genes
are both consistently up-regulated across many cancer studies, and are well
connected in known gene networks. Second, on a recent pan-cancer study that
examined the expression profiles of patients with or without mutations in the
HLA complex, we detected an active module of up-regulated genes that are
related to immune responses. Thanks to our ability to quantify the false
discovery rate, we detected thrice more genes as compared to the original

detailed models of the acceleration and propagation of energetic electrons.

Copernicus telescope in Asiago, while the second one, Iqueye, was mounted at
the ESO New Technology Telescope in Chile, and at the William Herschel
Telescope and Telescopio Nazionale Galileo on the Roque (La Palma, Canary
Islands). Both instruments deliver extraordinarily accurate results in optical
pulsar timing. Recently, Iqueye was moved to Asiago to be mounted at the 1.2 m
Galileo telescope to attempt, for the first time ever, experiments of optical
intensity interferometry (a` la Hanbury Brown and Twiss) on a baseline of a few
kilometers, together with the Copernicus telescope. This application was one of
the original goals for the development of our instrumentation. To carry out
these measurements, we are experimenting a new way of coupling the instruments
to the telescopes, by means of moderate-aperture, low-optical-attenuation
multi-mode optical fibers with a double-clad design. Fibers are housed in
dedicated optical interfaces attached to the focus of another instrument of the
1.8 m telescope (Aqueye+) or to the Nasmyth focus of the 1.2 m telescope
(Iqueye). This soft-mount solution has the advantage to facilitate the mounting
of the photon counters, to keep them under controlled temperature and humidity
conditions (reducing potential systematics related to varying ambient
conditions), and to mitigate scheduling requirements. Here we will describe the
first successful implementation of the Asiago intensity interferometer and
future plans for improving it.

accomplish the local repair, which leads to the concept of
$(r,\delta)$-locality. A $q$-ary $[n, k]$ linear code $\cC$ is said to have

optimal if it meets the Singleton-like bound for $(r,\delta)$-LRCs. A class of

expansion induced by the truncation of critical short protein segments.
Accordingly, the floppy disordered proteins form a weakly cross-bridged

ordinary differential equations (ODEs) coupled with variational inequalities

paper. We first study the conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions.
The central idea behind the proof is to rewrite the system dynamics as a
differential inclusion which can be decomposed into a single-valued Lipschitz
map, and a time-dependent maximal monotone operator. Regularity assumptions on
the set-valued mapping determine the regularity of the resulting solutions.
Complementarity systems with time-dependence are studied as a particular case.
We then use this result to study the problem of designing state feedback
control laws for output regulation in systems described by EVIs. The derivation
of control laws for output regulation is based on the use of internal model
principle, and two cases are treated: First, a static feedback control law is
derived when full state feedback is available, In the second case, only the
error to be regulated is assumed to be available for measurement and a dynamic
compensator is designed. As applications, we demonstrate how control input
resulting from the solution of a variational inequality results in regulating
the output of the system while maintaining polyhedral state constraints.
Another application is seen in designing control inputs for regulation in power
converters.

fairly consistent with the mass-size relationship of z~2 compact, quiescent
galaxies (cQGs). The median IR-radio correlation parameter is found to be
q=2.27, which is lower than measured locally (median q=2.64). AzTEC1 is found
to have a sub-Eddington SFR surface density (by a factor of 2.6), while AzTEC3
appears to be an Eddington-limited starburster. The gas reservoir in these two
high-z SMGs would be exhausted in only ~86 and 19 Myr at the current SFR,
respectively. A comparison of the MAGPHYS-based properties of our SMGs with
those of equally bright ALESS SMGs suggests that the two populations share
fairly similar physical characteristics, including the q parameter. A hint of
negative correlation is found between the 3 GHz size and the level of
starburstiness, and hence cosmic-ray electrons in more compact starbursts might
be more susceptible to free-free absorption. Some of the derived low and high q
values (compared to the local median) could be the result of a specific
merger/post-starburst phase of galaxy evolution. Overall, our results support
the scenario where z>3 SMGs evolve into today's giant ellipticals.

strongly variable, polarized multi-wavelength emission from relativistic jet
sources such as blazars, via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) of relativistic
particles. This paper summarizes recent results on a self-consistent coupling
of diffusive shock acceleration and radiation transfer in blazar jets. We
demonstrate that the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars
strongly constrain the nature of hydromagnetic turbulence responsible for
pitch-angle scattering by requiring a strongly energy-dependent pitch-angle
mean free path. The prominent soft X-ray excess (""Big Blue Bump"") in the SED of
the BL Lac object AO 0235+164 can be modelled as the signature of bulk Compton
scattering of external radiation fields by the thermal electron population,
which places additional constraints on the level of hydromagnetic turbulence.
It has further been demonstrated that internal shocks propagating in a jet
pervaded by a helical magnetic field naturally produce polarization-angle
swings by 180$^o$, in tandem with multi-wavelength flaring activity, without
requiring any helical motion paths or other asymmetric jet structures. The
specific application of this model to 3C279 presents the first consistent,
simultaneous modeling of snap-shot SEDs, multi-wavelength light curves and
time-dependent polarization signatures of a blazar during a polarization-angle
(PA) rotation. This model has recently been generalized to a lepto-hadronic
model, in which the high-energy emission is dominated by proton synchrotron
radiation. It is shown that in this case, the high-energy (X-ray and
$\gamma$-ray) polarization signatures are expected to be significantly more
stable (not showing PA rotations) than the low-energy (electron-synchrotron)

abundances, kinematics, or age; or geometrically, as stars high above the
mid-plane. In nearby galaxies, where only a geometric definition can be used,
thick disks appear to have large radial scale-lengths, and their red colors
suggest that they are uniformly old. The Milky Way's geometrically thick disk
is also radially extended, but it is far from chemically uniform:
alpha-enhanced stars are confined within the inner Galaxy. In simulated
galaxies, where old stars are centrally concentrated, geometrically thick disks
are radially extended, too. Younger stellar populations flare in the simulated
disks' outer regions, bringing those stars high above the mid-plane. The
resulting geometrically thick disks therefore show a radial age gradient, from
old in their central regions to younger in their outskirts. Based on our age
estimates for a large sample of giant stars in the APOGEE survey, we can now
test this scenario for the Milky Way. We find that the geometrically-defined
thick disk in the Milky Way has indeed a strong radial age gradient: the median
age for red clump stars goes from ~9 Gyr in the inner disk to 5 Gyr in the
outer disk. We propose that at least some nearby galaxies could also have thick
disks that are not uniformly old, and that geometrically thick disks might be
complex structures resulting from different formation mechanisms in their inner
and outer parts.

this paper, we expand this study to simulate the light-bending effect of a

$\lesssim 10^{-6}$) that the direct line of sight between the $\gamma$-ray

recent findings in the $\mathcal{N}=2^{*}$ theory, we explore the theories that
are characterized by special fixed ratios $\varepsilon_{2}/\varepsilon_{1}$ and
${\bf m}/\varepsilon_{1}$ and propose a simple condition on the structure of
the multi-instanton contributions to the prepotential determining the effective

that the prepotential has $N$ poles at fixed positions independent on the
instanton number. In analogy with what happens in the $\mathcal{N}=2^{*}$ gauge
theory, the full prepotential of the $\Pi_{N}$ theories may be given in closed
form as an explicit function of $a$ and the modular parameter $q$ appearing in
special combinations of Eisenstein series and Jacobi theta functions with well
defined modular properties. The resulting finite pole partition functions are
related by AGT correspondence to special 4-point spherical conformal blocks of
the Virasoro algebra. We examine in full details special cases where the closed
expression of the block is known and confirms our Ansatz. We systematically
study the special features of Zamolodchikov's recursion for the $\Pi_{N}$

that brings back partial computation load from the cloud to the edge devices,
is envisioned to be the next big change in computing, and has the potential to
address these challenges. Being a highly distributed, loosely coupled and still
in the emerging phase, standardization, quality-of-service management and
dynamic adaptability are the key challenges faced by fog computing research
fraternity today. This article aims to address these issues by proposing a
service-oriented middleware that leverages the convergence of cloud and fog

affect the surface transport of magnetic flux, as well as their impact on the
generation of the Sun's poloidal field. The inflows constitute a potential
non-linear mechanism for the saturation of the global dynamo and may contribute
to the modulation of the solar cycle in the Babcock-Leighton framework.
  Methods: We build a surface flux transport code incorporating a parametrized
model of the inflows and run simulations spanning several cycles. We carry out
a parameter study to assess how the strength and extension of the inflows
affect the build-up of the global dipole field. We also perform simulations
with different levels of activity to investigate the potential role of the
inflows in the saturation of the global dynamo.
  Results: We find that the interaction of neighbouring active regions can lead
to the occasional formation of single-polarity magnetic flux clumps
inconsistent with observations. We propose the darkening caused by pores in
areas of high magnetic field strength as a plausible mechanism preventing this
flux-clumping. We find that inflows decrease the amplitude of the axial dipole
moment by a $\sim30\,\%$, relative to a no-inflows scenario. Stronger (weaker)
inflows lead to larger (smaller) reductions of the axial dipole moment. The
relative amplitude of the generated axial dipole is about $9\%$ larger after
very weak cycles than after very strong cycles. This supports the inflows as a
non-linear mechanism capable of saturating the global dynamo and contributing
to the modulation of the solar cycle within the Babcock-Leighton framework.

redox active molecular orbital that is weakly coupled to the electrodes and
closely aligned with the Fermi energy of the leads because of the
spin-polarised ground state unique to the Mo centre. This situation opens an
additional slow and incoherent hopping channel for transport, triggering a
transient charging effect of the entire molecule and a strong hysteresis with

a powerful generic mechanism to define test objectives, which permits encoding
numerous existing criteria and supporting them in a unified way. HTOL comes
with a formal semantics and can express complex requirements over several

radiation-dominated Universe $\delta_{c}$ remains constant, if the Universe
experiences some dust-like phases (e.g. phase transitions) $\delta_{c}$ might
decrease, improving the chances of PBH formation. We studied the evolution of
$\delta_{c}$ during the QCD phase transition epoch within three different
models: Bag Model (BM), Lattice Fit Model (LFM), and Crossover Model (CM). We
found that the reduction on the background value of $\delta_{c}$ can be as high

systematic knowledge of these small representations could lead to proofs of

of rank of a representation. We describe a method, the ""eta correspondence"", to

find that if the external force accelerates only the nucleus and then the
