$K\subset\mathbb{D}$ which contains the point $1$ in its boundary is called a
convergence set for $f$ at $1$ if $f(z)$ converges to some value $\zeta$ as
$z\to1$ with $z\in K$. $K$ is called a path divergence set for $f$ at $1$ if
$f$ diverges along every path $\gamma$ which lies in $K$ and approaches $1$. In
this article, we show that for a path $\gamma$ through the unit disk from $-1$
to $1$, if $f$ fails to converge along $\gamma$, then either the region above
$\gamma$ or the region below $\gamma$ is a path divergence set for $f$. On the
other hand, if $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are two such paths, and $f$ converges
along both $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$, then the region between $\gamma_1$ and
$\gamma_2$ is a convergence set for $f$. This latter fact is immediate when
$\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ do not intersect except at their end-points, but
becomes non-trivial when $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are highly intersecting. We
conclude the paper with an examination of the convergence sets for the function
$e^{\frac{z+1}{z-1}}$ at $1$.

  observational studies on networks",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Causal inference on a population of units connected through a network often
presents technical challenges, including how to account for interference. In
the presence of local interference, for instance, potential outcomes of a unit
depend on its treatment as well as on the treatments of other local units, such
as its neighbors according to the network. In observational studies, a further
complication is that the typical unconfoundedness assumption must be extended -
say, to include the treatment of neighbors, and indi- vidual and neighborhood
covariates - to guarantee identification and valid inference. Here, we propose
new estimands that define treatment and interference effects. We then derive
analytical expressions for the bias of a naive estimator that wrongly assumes
away interference. The bias depends on the level of interference but also on
the degree of association between individual and neighborhood treatments. We
propose an extended unconfoundedness assumption that accounts for interference,
and we develop new covariate-adjustment methods that lead to valid estimates of
treatment and interference effects in observational studies on networks.
Estimation is based on a generalized propensity score that balances individual
and neighborhood covariates across units under different levels of individual
treatment and of exposure to neighbors' treatment. We carry out simulations,
calibrated using friendship networks and covariates in a nationally
representative longitudinal study of adolescents in grades 7-12, in the United
States, to explore finite-sample performance in different realistic settings.

of probe functions to define feature vectors that describe a set and the
nearness of sets is given by their proximities. A probe on a non-empty set $X$
is a real-valued function $\Phi: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$, where $\Phi(x)=
(\phi_1(x),.., \phi_n(x))$. We establish a connection between relations on an
object space $X$ and relations on the feature space $\Phi(X).$ Having as
starting point the Peters proximity, two sets are \emph{descriptively near}, if
and only if their descriptions intersect. In this paper, we construct a
theoretical approach to a more visual form of proximity, namely, descriptive
proximity, which has a broad spectrum of applications. We organize descriptive
proximities on two different levels: weaker or stronger than the Peters

that the H2 norm of a slack bus controlled system may scale unboundedly with
network size, while the norm remains uniformly bounded with droop or DAPI

demonstrate that the transient performance for the slack bus controlled system
deteriorates significantly as the network grows, which is not the case with the

rotation axes of the spin in the two problems coincide only for a vanishing
chiral angle, in which case the rotation angles coincide in the nonrelativistic

shows that in the nonrelativistic limit the interaction between the spin and a
reflecting surface with nonchiral boundary conditions is completely contained
in the Thomas precession effect, in conformity with the fact that these
boundary conditions are equivalent to an infinite repulsive scalar potential
outside the boundary. By contrast, in the ultrarelativistic limit the rotation
angle in the quantum problem remains finite, while in the classical one the
rotation angle diverges. We comment on the possible implications of this

techniques for performance enhancement in next-generation cellular
communications. Compared to orthogonal frequency division multiple access
(OFDMA), which is a well-known high-capacity orthogonal multiple access (OMA)
technique, NOMA offers a set of desirable benefits, including greater spectrum
efficiency. There are different types of NOMA techniques, including
power-domain and code-domain. This paper primarily focuses on power-domain NOMA
that utilizes superposition coding (SC) at the transmitter and successive
interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver. Various researchers have
demonstrated that NOMA can be used effectively to meet both network-level and
user-experienced data rate requirements of fifth-generation (5G) technologies.
From that perspective, this paper comprehensively surveys the recent progress
of NOMA in 5G systems, reviewing the state-of-the-art capacity analysis, power
allocation strategies, user fairness, and user-pairing schemes in NOMA. In
addition, this paper discusses how NOMA performs when it is integrated with
various proven wireless communications techniques, such as cooperative
communications, multiple input multiple output (MIMO), beamforming, space time
coding, and network coding, among others. Furthermore, this paper discusses
several important issues on NOMA implementation and provides some avenues for
future research.

analyzed computationally for the case when the forcing frequency is much lower
than the von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n vortex shedding frequency corresponding to the
constant flow velocity condition. By using the Koopman Mode Decomposition
approach, we find a new normal form equation that extends the classical Hopf
bifurcation normal form by a time-dependent term for Reynolds numbers close to
the Hopf bifurcation value. The normal form describes the dynamics of an
observable and features a forcing (control) term that multiplies the state, and
is thus a parametric - i.e. not an additive - forcing effect. We find that the
dynamics of the flow in this regime are characterized by alternating instances
of quiescent and strong oscillatory behavior, and that this pattern persists
indefinitely. Furthermore, the spectrum of the associated Koopman operator is
shown to possess quasi-periodic features. We establish the theoretical
underpinnings of this phenomenon -- that we name Quasi-Periodic Intermittency
-- using the new normal form model and show that the dynamics are caused by the
tendency of the flow to oscillate between the unstable fixed point and the
stable limit cycle of the unforced flow. The quasi-periodic intermittency
phenomena is also characterized by positive Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents

arbitrary fixed error, granted the access to a certain oracle. Namely, given a
fixed error, we derive two upper bounds on the running time. The first bound is
linear in the number of measurements. The second bound scales as the number of
measurements to the sixth power. The former is dominant only for a very high
number of measurements and is never saturated in the performed numerical tests.
We then introduce a simple algorithm for simulating the oracle. In all the
considered numerical tests, the simulation of the oracle contributes with a
multiplicative factor to the overall running time and, thus, does not affect
the sixth-power law of the oracle-assisted algorithm.

to propagate the information from one device to another. The non-reciprocity of
both device and interconnect is realized by sizing different contact areas at

proposed logic is suitable for scaling due to a high energy barrier provided by
a long FM wire. Compared to the scheme based on non-local spin valves (NLSVs)
in the previous proposal, the devices can be operated at lower current density
due to utilizing all injected spins for local magnetization reversals, and thus
improve both energy efficiency and resistance to electromigration. This device
concept is justified by simulating a buffer, an inverter, and a 3-input
majority gate with comprehensive numerical simulations, including spin
transport through the FM/non-magnetic (NM) interfaces as well as the NM channel
and stochastic magnetization dynamics inside FM wires. In addition to digital
computing, the proposed framework can also be used as a transducer between DWs

realizations of quantum annealers with superconducting qubits face two major
challenges. First, the connectivity between the qubits is limited, excluding
many optimization problems from a direct implementation. Second, decoherence
degrades the success probability of the optimization. We address both of these
shortcomings and propose an architecture in which the qubits are robustly
encoded in continuous variable degrees of freedom. Remarkably, by leveraging
the phenomenon of flux quantization, all-to-all connectivity is obtained
without overhead. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of this
architecture by simulating the optimal solution of a small instance of the
NP-hard and fully connected number partitioning problem in the presence of
dissipation.

a point-plane incidence bound of Rudnev. We then cover most of the point set

sum-product-type problems, an expander problem of Bourgain, the distinct

literature characterizations.
  In the context of finite structures, we formulate an abstract combinatorial
property of structures, that when satisfied by a class, ensures that
$\mathsf{GLT}(k)$ holds over the class. This property, that we call the
*Equivalent Bounded Substructure Property*, abbreviated $\mathsf{EBSP}$,
intuitively states that a large structure contains a small ""logically similar""
substructure. It turns out that this simply stated property is enjoyed by a
variety of classes of interest in computer science: examples include words,
trees (unordered, ordered or ranked), nested words, graph classes of bounded
tree-depth/shrub-depth, and $m$-partite cographs. Further, $\mathsf{EBSP}$
remains preserved under various well-studied operations, such as
complementation, transpose, the line-graph operation, disjoint union, cartesian
and tensor products, etc. This enables constructing a wide spectrum of classes
that satisfy $\mathsf{EBSP}$, and hence $\mathsf{GLT}(k)$. Remarkably,
$\mathsf{EBSP}$ can be regarded as a finitary analogue of the classical
downward L\""owenheim-Skolem property.
  In summary, this dissertation provides new notions and results in both

Bayesian credible regions. This profile implies a mass within $125$kpc of
$4.8\times10^{11}M_{\odot}$ with a 95\% Bayesian credible region of
$(4.0-5.8)\times10^{11}M_{\odot}$. Our results also provide estimates of the
true specific energies of all the GCs. By comparing these estimated energies to
the measured energies of GCs with complete velocity measurements, we observe
that (the few) remote tracers with complete measurements may play a large role
in determining a total mass estimate of the Galaxy. Thus, our study stresses
the need for more remote tracers with complete velocity measurements.

rate of 0.35-12.3 solar masses per year. The values within this range are
comparable to the star formation rate in Circinus, indicating that the outflow
indeed regulates star formation to some degree. The molecular outflow in
Circinus is considerably lower in mass and energetics than previously-studied
AGN-driven outflows, especially given its high ratio of AGN luminosity to
bolometric luminosity. The molecular outflow in Circinus is, however,

short-range interactions in the deep inelastic regime of large wave vector
transfer $q$, where the dynamic structure factor is dominated by a resonance
near the free-particle energy $\hbar\omega=\varepsilon_{\bf q}=\hbar^2q^2/2m$.
Using a systematic short-distance expansion, the structure factor at high
momentum is shown to exhibit a nontrivial dependence on frequency characterized
by two separate scaling regimes. First, for frequencies that differ from the
single-particle energy by terms of order ${\cal O}(q)$ (i.e., small deviations
compared to the single-particle energy), the dynamic structure factor is
described by the impulse approximation of Hohenberg and Platzman. Second,
deviations of order ${\cal O}(q^2)$ (i.e., of the same order or larger than the
single-particle energy) are described by the operator product expansion, with a
universal crossover connecting both regimes. The scaling is consistent with a
number of sum rules in the large momentum limit. Furthermore, we derive an
exact expression for the shift and width of the single-particle peak at large
momentum due to interactions, thus extending a result by Beliaev [JETP 7, 299
(1958)] for the low-density Bose gas to arbitrary values of the scattering
length $a$. The shift exhibits a maximum around $qa \simeq 1$, which is
connected with a maximum in the static structure factor due to strong
short-range correlations. For Bose gases with moderate interaction strengths,
the theoretically predicted shift is consistent with the value observed by Papp
et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 135301 (2008)]. Finally, we develop a
diagrammatic theory for the dynamic structure factor which accounts for the
correlations beyond Bogoliubov theory and which covers the full range of

remains unobservable within the domain of a single observer where the symmetry

radiative cooling. To this end, we compile a large sample of 39 cool core
clusters and determine steady state solutions of the hydrodynamic equations
that are coupled to the CR energy equation. We find solutions that match the
observed density and temperature profiles for all our clusters well. Radiative
cooling is balanced by CR heating in the cluster centres and by thermal
conduction on larger scales, thus demonstrating the relevance of both heating
mechanisms. Our mass deposition rates vary by three orders of magnitude and are
linearly correlated to the observed star formation rates. Clusters with large
mass deposition rates show larger cooling radii and require a larger radial
extent of the CR injection function. Interestingly, our sample shows a
continuous sequence in cooling properties: clusters hosting radio mini halos
are characterised by the largest cooling radii, star formation and mass
deposition rates in our sample and thus signal the presence of a higher cooling
activity. The steady state solutions support the structural differences between
clusters hosting a radio mini halo and those that do not.

critical in balancing radiative cooling of the low-entropy gas at the centres
of galaxy clusters and in regulating star formation in central galaxies. In a
companion paper, we found steady-state solutions of the hydrodynamic equations
that are coupled to the CR energy equation for a large cluster sample. In those
solutions, radiative cooling in the central region is balanced by streaming CRs
through the generation and dissipation of resonantly generated Alfv{\'e}n waves
and by thermal conduction at large radii. Here we demonstrate that the
predicted non-thermal emission resulting from hadronic CR interactions in the
intra-cluster medium exceeds observational radio (and gamma-ray) data in a
subsample of clusters that host radio mini halos (RMHs). In contrast, the
predicted non-thermal emission is well below observational data in cooling
galaxy clusters without RMHs. These are characterised by exceptionally large
AGN radio fluxes, indicating high CR yields and associated CR heating rates. We
suggest a self-regulation cycle of AGN feedback in which non-RMH clusters are
heated by streaming CRs homogeneously throughout the central cooling region. We
predict {\em radio micro halos} surrounding the AGNs of these CR-heated
clusters in which the primary emission may predominate the hadronically
generated emission. Once the CR population has streamed sufficiently far and
lost enough energy, the cooling rate increases, which explains the increased
star formation rates in clusters hosting RMHs. Those could be powered
hadronically by CRs that have previously heated the cluster core.

  In this paper, we consider map labeling for the case that a map undergoes a

several preceding models for dynamic map labeling into one versatile and

both for map features with fixed position as well as for moving entities (e.g.,

one in which excitons are dressed by interactions with a Fermi sea of excess

attractive exciton-polaron branch, normally identified as a trion branch, and a
higher energy repulsive exciton-polaron branch, normally identified as an
exciton branch. We have calculated the frequency and doping dependence of the
optical conductivity and found that: (i) the splitting varies linearly with the
Fermi energy of the excess quasiparticles; (ii) the trion peak is dominant at
high carrier densities; (iii) and the trion peak width is considerably smaller
than that of the excitonic peak. Our results are in good agreement with recent

regulatory networks from gene expression data is a problem that has attracted
much attention, but previous work often makes the simplifying (but unrealistic)
assumption that regulator activity is represented by mRNA levels. We use a
latent tree graphical model to analyze gene expression without relying on
transcription factor expression as a proxy for regulator activity. The latent
tree model is a type of Markov random field that includes both observed gene
variables and latent (hidden) variables, which factorize on a Markov tree.
Through efficient unsupervised learning approaches, we determine which groups
of genes are co-regulated by hidden regulators and the activity levels of those
regulators. Post-processing annotates many of these discovered latent variables
as specific transcription factors or groups of transcription factors. Other
latent variables do not necessarily represent physical regulators but instead
reveal hidden structure in the gene expression such as shared biological
function. We apply the latent tree graphical model to a yeast stress response
dataset. In addition to novel predictions, such as condition-specific binding
of the transcription factor Msn4, our model recovers many known aspects of the
yeast regulatory network. These include groups of co-regulated genes,
condition-specific regulator activity, and combinatorial regulation among
transcription factors. The latent tree graphical model is a general approach

possible regulators exist, regulator activity, or where transcription factors
physically bind.

continuum emission. In addition, we detect a C3H2 emission ring with an
identical spatial distribution to C2H in the TW Hya disk. This suggests that

thermo-chemical model we show that reproducing the emission from C2H requires a
strong UV field and C/O > 1 in the upper disk atmosphere and outer disk, beyond
the edge of the pebble disk. This naturally arises in a disk where the
ice-coated dust mass is spatially stratified due to the combined effects of
coagulation, gravitational settling and drift. This stratification causes the
disk surface and outer disk to have a greater permeability to UV photons.
Furthermore the concentration of ices that transport key volatile carriers of
oxygen and carbon in the midplane, along with photochemical erosion of CO,
leads to an elemental C/O ratio that exceeds unity in the UV-dominated disk.
Thus the motions of the grains, and not the gas, lead to a rich hydrocarbon

an important driver of sea-level changes. Anthropogenic climate change may
drive a sizeable AIS tipping point response with subsequent increases in
coastal flooding risks. Many studies analyzing flood risks use simple models to
project the future responses of AIS and its sea-level contributions. These
analyses have provided important new insights, but they are often silent on the
effects of potentially important processes such as Marine Ice Sheet Instability
(MISI) or Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI). These approximations can be well
justified and result in more parsimonious and transparent model structures.
This raises the question of how this approximation impacts hindcasts and
projections. Here, we calibrate a previously published and relatively simple
AIS model, which neglects the effects of MICI and regional characteristics,
using a combination of observational constraints and a Bayesian inversion
method. Specifically, we approximate the effects of missing MICI by comparing
our results to those from expert assessments with more realistic models and
quantify the bias during the last interglacial when MICI may have been
triggered. Our results suggest that the model can approximate the process of
MISI and reproduce the projected median melt from some previous expert
assessments in the year 2100. Yet, our mean hindcast is roughly 3/4 of the
observed data during the last interglacial period and our mean projection is
roughly 1/6 and 1/10 of the mean from a model accounting for MICI in the year
2100. These results suggest that missing MICI and/or regional characteristics
can lead to a low-bias during warming period AIS melting and hence a potential
low-bias in projected sea levels and flood risks.

this problem. In the current work, the problem of fixed value impulse noise
(salt and pepper) removal from images is investigated by use of a Markov Random
Field (MRF) models with smoothness priors. After the formulation of the problem
as an inpainting problem, graph cuts with $\alpha$-expansion moves are
considered for minimization of the energy functional. As for comparisons,
several other minimization techniques that are widely used for MRF models'
optimization are considered and the results are compared using
Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) as
metrics. The investigations show the superiority of graph cuts with
$\alpha$-expansion moves over the other techniques both in terms of PSNR and
also computational times.

attempts at analyzing its behavior. Defined by a simple nested recurrence and
an initial condition, the sequence looks approximately linear, though with a
lot of noise. But, nobody even knows whether the sequence is infinite. In the
years since Hofstadter published his sequence, various people have found
variants with predictable behavior. Oftentimes, the resulting sequence looks
complicated but provably grows linearly. Other times, the sequences are
eventually linear recurrent. Proofs describing the behaviors of both types of
sequence are inductive. In the first case, the inductive hypotheses are fairly
ad-hoc, but the proofs in the second case are highly automatable. This suggests
that a search for more sequences like these may be fruitful. In this paper, we
develop a step-by-step symbolic algorithm to search for these sequences. Using
this algorithm, we determine that such sequences come in infinite families that
are themselves plentiful. In fact,there are hundreds of easy to describe
families based on the Hofstadter Q-recurrence alone.

signal enhancement through multiphoton momentum transfer and suppression of
systematics by not changing the internal state of atoms. Its multi-port nature,
however, can lead to parasitic interferometers, allows for intensity-dependent
phase shifts in the primary interferometers, and distorts the ellipses used for
phase extraction. We study and suppress these unwanted effects. Specifically,
phase extraction by ellipse fitting and the resulting systematic phase shifts
are calculated by Monte Carlo simulations. Phase shifts arising from the
thermal motion of the atoms are controlled by spatial selection of atoms and an
appropriate choice of Bragg intensity. In these simulations, we found that
Gaussian Bragg pulse shapes yield the smallest systematic shifts. Parasitic
interferometers are suppressed by a ""magic"" Bragg pulse duration. The
sensitivity of the apparatus was improved by the addition of AC Stark shift
compensation, which permits direct experimental study of sub-part-per-billion

reconstructing and analyzing the dynamics of a nonlinear system based on
time-series outputs. The efficacy of delay-coordinate mapping has long been
supported by Takens' embedding theorem, which guarantees that delay-coordinate
maps use the time-series output to provide a reconstruction of the hidden state
space that is a one-to-one embedding of the system's attractor. While this
topological guarantee ensures that distinct points in the reconstruction
correspond to distinct points in the original state space, it does not
characterize the quality of this embedding or illuminate how the specific
parameters affect the reconstruction. In this paper, we extend Takens' result
by establishing conditions under which delay-coordinate mapping is guaranteed
to provide a stable embedding of a system's attractor. Beyond only preserving
the attractor topology, a stable embedding preserves the attractor geometry by
ensuring that distances between points in the state space are approximately
preserved. In particular, we find that delay-coordinate mapping stably embeds
an attractor of a dynamical system if the stable rank of the system is large
enough to be proportional to the dimension of the attractor. The stable rank
reflects the relation between the sampling interval and the number of delays in
delay-coordinate mapping. Our theoretical findings give guidance to choosing
system parameters, echoing the trade-off between irrelevancy and redundancy
that has been heuristically investigated in the literature. Our initial result
is stated for attractors that are smooth submanifolds of Euclidean space, with
extensions provided for the case of strange attractors.

aluminum, they are mounted inside a light-tight package made from bulk
aluminum, and they are operated near $150 \, \mathrm{mK}$. Since the thin-film
aluminum has a slightly elevated critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c} = 1.4 \,
\mathrm{K}$), it therefore transitions before the package ($T_\mathrm{c} = 1.2
\, \mathrm{K}$), which also serves as a magnetic shield. On cooldown, ambient
magnetic fields as small as approximately $30 \, \mathrm{\mu T}$ can produce
vortices in the thin-film aluminum as it transitions because the bulk aluminum
package has not yet transitioned and therefore is not yet shielding. These
vortices become trapped inside the aluminum package below $1.2 \, \mathrm{K}$
and ultimately produce low internal quality factors in the thin-film
superconducting resonators. We show that by controlling the strength of the
magnetic field present when the thin film transitions, we can control the
internal quality factor of the resonators. We also compare the noise
performance with and without vortices present, and find no evidence for excess
noise beyond the increase in amplifier noise, which is expected with increasing
loss.

range is studied, in which a transmitter sends $K$ messages to $K$ receivers,
and the channel quality gradually degrades from receiver $K$ to receiver 1.
Each receiver $k$ is required to decode message $W_1,\ldots,W_k$, for $1\leq
k\leq K$, and to be kept ignorant of $W_{k+2},\ldots,W_K$, for $k=1,\ldots,
K-2$. Thus, each message $W_k$ is kept secure from receivers with at least
two-level worse channel quality, i.e., receivers 1, $\ldots$, $k-2$. The
secrecy capacity region is fully characterized. The achievable scheme
designates one superposition layer to each message with binning employed for
each layer. Joint embedded coding and binning are employed to protect all
upper-layer messages from lower-layer receivers. Furthermore, the scheme allows
adjacent layers to share rates so that part of the rate of each message can be
shared with its immediate upper-layer message to enlarge the rate region. More
importantly, an induction approach is developed to perform Fourier-Motzkin
elimination of $2K$ variables from the order of $K^2$ bounds to obtain a
close-form achievable rate region. An outer bound is developed that matches the
achievable rate region, whose proof involves recursive construction of the rate
bounds and exploits the intuition gained from the achievable scheme.

zero-sum random noises to the consensus process. However, there is lack of
theoretical analysis to quantify the degree of the privacy protection. In this
paper, we introduce the maximum disclosure probability that the other nodes can
infer one node's initial state within a given small interval to quantify the

added noise with uniform distribution is optimal in terms of achieving the

Under linear and Gaussian assumptions, smoothed estimates can be obtained using
efficient recursions, for example Rauch-Tung-Striebel and Mayne-Fraser
algorithms. Such schemes are equivalent to linear algebraic techniques that
minimize a convex quadratic objective function with structure induced by the
dynamic model.
  These classical formulations fall short in many important circumstances. For
instance, smoothers obtained using quadratic penalties can fail when outliers
are present in the data, and cannot track impulsive inputs and abrupt state
changes. Motivated by these shortcomings, generalized Kalman smoothing
formulations have been proposed in the last few years, replacing quadratic
models with more suitable, often nonsmooth, convex functions. In contrast to
classical models, these general estimators require use of iterated algorithms,
and these have received increased attention from control, signal processing,
machine learning, and optimization communities.
  In this survey we show that the optimization viewpoint provides the control
and signal processing community great freedom in the development of novel
modeling and inference frameworks for dynamical systems. We discuss general
statistical models for dynamic systems, making full use of nonsmooth convex
penalties and constraints, and providing links to important models in signal
processing and machine learning. We also survey optimization techniques for
these formulations, paying close attention to dynamic problem structure.
Modeling concepts and algorithms are illustrated with numerical examples.

planning or configuration systems usually operate on the basis of knowledge
represented by means of some logical language. Such a logical knowledge base
(KB) enables intelligent behavior of such systems by allowing them to
automatically reason, answer queries of interest or solve complex real-world
problems. Nowadays, where information acquisition comes at low costs and often
happens automatically, the applied KBs are continuously growing in terms of
size, information content and complexity. These developments foster the
emergence of errors in these KBs and thus pose a significant challenge on all
people and tools involved in KB evolution, maintenance and application.
  If some minimal quality criteria such as logical consistency are not met by
some KB, it becomes useless for knowledge-based applications. To guarantee the
compliance of KBs with given requirements, (non-interactive) KB debuggers have
been proposed. These however often cannot localize all potential faults,
suggest too large or incorrect modifications of the faulty KB or suffer from
poor scalability due to the inherent complexity of the KB debugging problem.
  As a remedy to these issues, based on a well-founded theoretical basis this
work proposes complete, sound and optimal methods for the interactive debugging
of KBs that suggest the one (minimally invasive) error correction of the faulty
KB that yields a repaired KB with exactly the intended semantics. Users, e.g.
domain experts, are involved in the debugging process by answering
automatically generated queries whether some given statements must or must not
hold in the domain that should be modeled by the problematic KB at hand.

Starting from the compressed suffix array (CSA) by Grossi and Vitter (STOC
2000) and the FM-index by Ferragina and Manzini (FOCS 2000), a number of
generalizations and applications of string indexes based on the Burrows-Wheeler
transform (BWT) have been developed, all taking an amount of space that is
close to the input size in bits. In many large-scale applications, the
construction of the index and its usage need to be considered as one unit of
computation. Efficient string indexing and analysis in small space lies also at
the core of a number of primitives in the data-intensive field of
high-throughput DNA sequencing. We report the following advances in string
indexing and analysis. We show that the BWT of a string $T\in
\{1,\ldots,\sigma\}^n$ can be built in deterministic $O(n)$ time using just
$O(n\log{\sigma})$ bits of space, where $\sigma \leq n$. Within the same time
and space budget, we can build an index based on the BWT that allows one to
enumerate all the internal nodes of the suffix tree of $T$. Many fundamental
string analysis problems can be mapped to such enumeration, and can thus be
solved in deterministic $O(n)$ time and in $O(n\log{\sigma})$ bits of space
from the input string. We also show how to build many of the existing indexes
based on the BWT, such as the CSA, the compressed suffix tree (CST), and the
bidirectional BWT index, in randomized $O(n)$ time and in $O(n\log{\sigma})$
bits of space. The previously fastest construction algorithms for BWT, CSA and
CST, which used $O(n\log{\sigma})$ bits of space, took $O(n\log{\log{\sigma}})$
time for the first two structures, and $O(n\log^{\epsilon}n)$ time for the
third, where $\epsilon$ is any positive constant. Contrary to the state of the
art, our bidirectional BWT index supports every operation in constant time per
element in its output.

the main belt making them more difficult to identify with the hierarchical
clustering method (HCM) with increasing family age. The discovery of the
Eulalia and new Polana families in the inner belt relied on new techniques
because Yarkovsky spreading made them too disperse to be identified using the
classical HCM. The technique used to discover the new Polana and Eulalia
families is modified to identify asteroid families by searching for
correlations between $a$ and asteroid diameter, $D$, or absolute magnitude,
$H$. A group of asteroids is identified as a collisional family if its boundary
in the $a$ vs. 1/$D$ or $a$ vs. $H$ planes has a characteristic V-shape which
is due to the size dependent Yarkovsky spreading. The V-shape boundary is
identified with two separate techniques. The first identifies a border by
measuring the drop between the number of objects inside and outside of the
border. The second identifies the V-shape border by measuring the number
density of objects in $a$ vs. 1/$D$,$H$ space. The V-shape techniques are
demonstrated on known families Erigone, Vesta, Koronis, and families difficult
to identify by HCM such as Flora, Baptistina, new Polana, Eulalia and Karin.
Application of the technique in a search for >2 Gyr-old families throughout the
MB is discussed.

number of multiclass classification surrogate losses. Calibration functions are
a powerful tool for easily converting bounds for the surrogate risk (which can
be computed through well-known methods) into bounds for the true risk, the
probability of making a mistake. They are particularly suitable in
non-parametric settings, where the approximation error can be controlled, and
provide tighter bounds than the common technique of upper-bounding the 0-1 loss
by the surrogate loss.
  The abstract nature of the more sophisticated existing calibration function
results requires calibration functions to be explicitly derived on a
case-by-case basis, requiring repeated efforts whenever bounds for a new
surrogate loss are required. We devise a streamlined analysis that simplifies
the process of deriving calibration functions for a large number of surrogate
losses that have been proposed in the literature. The effort of deriving
calibration functions is then surmised in verifying, for a chosen surrogate
loss, a small number of conditions that we introduce.
  As case studies, we recover existing calibration functions for the well-known
loss of Lee et al. (2004), and also provide novel calibration functions for
well-known losses, including the one-versus-all loss and the logistic
regression loss, plus a number of other losses that have been shown to be
classification-calibrated in the past, but for which no calibration function
had been derived.

Algol with a mass ratio of 0.211, an orbital inclination of 73.9 deg, and a
large temperature difference of 2,534 K. To examine in detail both spot
variations and pulsations, we separately analyzed the {\it Kepler} time-series

reveal that the variable asymmetries of the light maxima can be interpreted as
the changes of a magnetic cool spot on the secondary component with time.
Multiple frequency analyses were performed in the outside-eclipse light
residuals after removal of the binarity effects from the observed {\it Kepler}
data. We detected 30 frequencies with signal to noise amplitude ratios larger
than 4.0, of which six ($f_2$--$f_6$ and $f_{10}$) can be identified as
high-order (17 $\le n \le$ 25) low-degree ($\ell$ = 2) gravity-mode pulsations
that were stable during the observing run of 200 d. In contrast, the other
frequencies may be harmonic and combination terms. For the six frequencies, the
pulsation periods and pulsation constants are in the ranges of 0.352$-$0.506 d
and 0.232$-$0.333 d, respectively. These values and the position on the HR

exoplanets, these systems are often equipped with advanced coronagraphs that
suppress the on-axis-star, interferometers to calibrate wavefront errors, and
low order wavefront sensors to stabilize any tip/tilt residuals to a degree
never seen before. Such systems are well positioned to facilitate the detailed
spectroscopic characterization of faint substellar companions at small angular
separations from the host star. Additionally, the increased light concentration
of the point-spread function and the unprecedented stability create
opportunities in other fields of astronomy as well, including spectroscopy.
With such Strehl ratios, efficient injection into single-mode fibers or
photonic lanterns becomes possible. With diffraction-limited components feeding
the instrument, calibrating a spectrograph's line profile becomes considerably
easier, as modal noise or imperfect scrambling of the fiber output are no
longer an issue. It also opens up the possibility of exploiting photonic
technologies for their advanced functionalities, inherent replicability, and
small, lightweight footprint to design and build future instrumentation. In
this work, we outline how extreme adaptive optics systems will enable advanced

precision of an instrument based on these technologies, would be limited by the
spectral content and stellar noise on cool stars and capable of achieving a

the deterministic switching of the magnetization to ultrafast excitation of the

switching mechanisms such as spin-transfer-torque (STT) or spin-orbit-torque
(SOT). The energy density required for switching is measured and the process is

in contrast, we analyze a dependent placement where SC APs are placed at
locations with poor service from the MC layer. Our goal is to obtain an
estimate of the number of SCs required to maintain a target outage rate. Such
an analysis is trivial if the MCs are located according to a Poisson point
process (PPP), which provides a lower bound on performance. Here, we consider
MCs placed on a hexagonal grid, which complements the PPP model by providing an
upper bound on performance. We first provide accurate bounds for the average
interference within a MC when SCs are not used. Then, by obtaining the outage
areas, we estimate the number of SCs required within an MC to overcome outage.
If resource allocation amongst SCs is not used, we show that the problem of
outage is not solved completely, and the residual outage area depends on
whether co-channel or orthogonal SCs are used. Simulations show that a much
smaller residual outage area is obtained with orthogonal SCs.

I superconductors, it is $H_{\textrm{c}}/\lambda$ where $H_\textrm{c}$ is the
thermodynamic critical field. But surprisingly for type II superconductors we
find the self-field $J_\textrm{c}$ is $H_{\textrm{c}1}/\lambda$ where
$H_{\textrm{c}1}$ is the lower critical field. $J_\textrm{c}$ is thus
fundamentally determined and this provides a simple means to extract absolute

wind is expected to trespass the BS. Despite these conditions, on the BS
space-time the gas achieves a stationary flux with the gas accumulating in a
high density elongated structure comparable to the shock cone formed behind a

the BH it is found on the downstream part of the BH near the event horizon. The
maximum density of the gas is smaller in the BS than in the BH case. Our
results indicate that the highest density of the wind is more similar on the BS

recent accretion events than in the inner halo and help map out the MW's dark
matter halo to its virial radius. We have re-examined the outermost regions of
11 existing stellar halo models with two synthetic surveys: one mimicking
present-day searches for distant M giants and another mimicking RR Lyrae (RRLe)

currently used to select M giant candidates for follow-up successfully remove
nearly all halo dwarf self-contamination and are useful for focusing
observations on distant M giants, of which there are thousands to tens of
thousands beyond 100 kpc in our models. We likewise expect that LSST will
identify comparable numbers of RRLe at these distances. We demonstrate that
several observable properties of both tracers, such as proximity of neighboring

different accreted structures from one another. We also discuss prospects for
using ratios of M giants to RRLe as a proxy for accretion time, which in the

conflicting control objectives and safety constraints. As a means of creating a
formal framework for controlling systems of this form, and with a view toward
automotive applications, this paper develops a methodology that allows safety
conditions -- expressed as control barrier functions -- to be unified with
performance objectives -- expressed as control Lyapunov functions -- in the
context of real-time optimization-based controllers. Safety conditions are
specified in terms of forward invariance of a set, and are verified via two
novel generalizations of barrier functions; in each case, the existence of a
barrier function satisfying Lyapunov-like conditions implies forward invariance
of the set, and the relationship between these two classes of barrier functions
is characterized. In addition, each of these formulations yields a notion of
control barrier function (CBF), providing inequality constraints in the control
input that, when satisfied, again imply forward invariance of the set. Through
these constructions, CBFs can naturally be unified with control Lyapunov
functions (CLFs) in the context of a quadratic program (QP); this allows for
the achievement of control objectives (represented by CLFs) subject to
conditions on the admissible states of the system (represented by CBFs). The
mediation of safety and performance through a QP is demonstrated on adaptive
cruise control and lane keeping, two automotive control problems that present
both safety and performance considerations coupled with actuator bounds.

We suggest that the rarity of these planets is due mainly to two effects.
First, we show that the most likely formation mechanism requires the
destruction of a companion star. Only pulsars with a suitable companion (with
an extreme mass ratio) are able to form planets. Second, while a dead zone (a
region of low turbulence) in the disk is generally thought to be essential for
planet formation, it is most probably rare in disks around pulsars because of
the irradiation from the pulsar. The irradiation strongly heats the inner parts
of the disk pushing the inner boundary of the dead zone out. We suggest that
the rarity of pulsar planets can be explained by the low probability for these
two requirements - a very low-mass companion and a dead zone - to be satisfied.

For the interacting Bloch electrons, the role of translation symmetry for

However, most known constructions require large field size, and hence may be

approach the cut-set bound as the reconstruction degree increases, and may be
realized over any given field if the file size is large enough. Since
distributed storage systems are the main purpose of regenerating codes, this
file size restriction is trivially satisfied in most conceivable scenarios. The

black holes in the extended phase space. Both the analytic expressions and
numerical results for the possible critical physical quantities are obtained.
It is proved that meaningful critical specific volume only exists when $p$ is
odd. This unique phenomenon may be attributed to the combined effect of $f(R)$
gravity and conformally invariant Maxwell field. It is also shown that the
ratio $P_cv_c/T_c$ differs from that of higher dimensional charged AdS black
holes in Einstein gravity. However, the ratio for four-dimensional $f(R)$ black
holes is the same as that of four-dimensional RN-AdS black holes, implying that
$f(R)$ gravity does not influence the ratio. So the ratio may be related to
conformally invariant Maxwell field. To probe the phase transition, we derive
the explicit expression of the Gibbs free energy with its graph plotted. Phase
transition analogous to the van der Waals liquid-gas system take place between
the small black hole and the large black hole. Classical swallow tail behavior,
characteristic of first order phase transition, can also be observed in the
Gibbs free energy graph. Critical exponents are also calculated. It is shown
that these exponents are exactly the same as those of other AdS black holes,
implying that neither $f(R)$ gravity nor conformally invariant Maxwell field
influence the critical exponents. Since the investigated black hole solution
depends on the form of the function $f(R)$, we discuss in detail how our
results put constraint on the form of the function $f(R)$ and we also present a
simple example.

heterogeneous attribute sources despite the disparate distributions of
different datasets. With the network we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on

N37 and its surrounding environment. The selected 15$' \times$15$'$ area around
the bubble contains two molecular clouds (N37 cloud; V$_{lsr}\sim$37-43 km
s$^{-1}$, and C25.29+0.31; V$_{lsr}\sim$43-48 km s$^{-1}$) along the line of
sight. A total of seven OB stars are identified towards the bubble N37 using
photometric criteria, and two of them are spectroscopically confirmed as O9V
and B0V stars. Spectro-photometric distances of these two sources confirm their
physical association with the bubble. The O9V star is appeared to be the
primary ionizing source of the region, which is also in agreement with the
desired Lyman continuum flux analysis estimated from the 20 cm data. The
presence of the expanding HII region is revealed in the N37 cloud which could
be responsible for the MIR bubble. Using the $^{13}$CO line data and
photometric data, several cold molecular condensations as well as clusters of
young stellar objects (YSOs) are identified in the N37 cloud, revealing ongoing
star formation (SF) activities. However, the analysis of ages of YSOs and the
dynamical age of the HII region do not support the origin of SF due to the
influence of OB stars. The position-velocity analysis of $^{13}$CO data reveals
that two molecular clouds are inter-connected by a bridge-like structure,
favoring the onset of a cloud-cloud collision process. The SF activities (i.e.
the formation of YSOs clusters and OB stars) in the N37 cloud are possibly
influenced by the cloud-cloud collision.

bounding box is achieved from the first frame of the video sequence based on a
traditional face detection method. Then, a landmark detector detects the facial
landmarks, which is based on a cascaded deep convolution neural network (DCNN).
Next, the face bounding box in the current frame is estimated and validated
after the facial landmarks in the previous frame are tracked based on the
median flow. Finally, the facial landmarks in the current frame are exactly
detected from the validated face bounding box via the landmark detector.
Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can detect the facial

variety of technological domains. Quantization-induced video compression
artifacts, which are usually unnoticeable in low resolution environments, are
typically conspicuous on high resolution VDUs and video data. The default
quantization matrices (QMs) in HEVC do not take into account specific display
resolutions of VDUs or video data to determine the appropriate levels of
quantization required to reduce unwanted compression artifacts. Therefore, we
propose a novel, adaptive quantization matrix technique for the HEVC standard
including Scalable HEVC (SHVC). Our technique, which is based on a refinement
of the current QM technique in HEVC, takes into consideration specific display
resolutions of the target VDUs in order to minimize compression artifacts. We
undertake a thorough evaluation of the proposed technique by utilizing SHVC SHM
9.0 (two-layered bit-stream) and the BD-Rate and SSIM metrics. For the BD-Rate
evaluation, the proposed method achieves maximum BD-Rate reductions of 56.5% in
the enhancement layer. For the SSIM evaluation, our technique achieves a
maximum structural improvement of 0.8660 vs. 0.8538.

Galactic bar and spiral arms in our own Milky Way galaxy, we examine as an
extragalactic counterpart the evidence for multiple distinct velocity
components in the cold, dense molecular gas populating a comparable region at
the end of the bar in the nearby galaxy NGC3627.
  Methods: We assemble a high resolution view of molecular gas kinematics
traced by CO(2-1) emission and extract line-of-sight velocity profiles from
regions of high and low gas velocity dispersion.
  Results: The high velocity dispersions arise with often double-peaked or
multiple line-profiles. We compare the centroids of the different velocity
components to expectations based on orbital dynamics in the presence of bar and
spiral potential perturbations. A model of the region as the interface of two
gas-populated orbits families supporting the bar and the independently rotating
spiral arms provides an overall good match to the data. An extent of the bar to
the corotation radius of the galaxy is favored.
  Conclusions: Using NGC3627 as an extragalactic example, we expect situations
like this to favor strong star formation events such as observed in our own
Milky Way since gas can pile up at the crossings between the orbit families.
The relative motions of the material following these orbits is likely even more
important for the build up of high density in the region. The surface densities
in NGC3627 are also so high that shear at the bar end is unlikely to
significantly weaken the star formation activity. We speculate that scenarios
in which the bar and spiral rotate at two different pattern speeds may be the
most favorable for intense star formation at such interfaces.

the hot medium arising from the collision, interacting strongly with the
latter, until they hadronize. Depending on the strength of the interaction
heavy quarks may or not approach kinetic equilibrium with the plasma, tending
in the first case to follow the collective flow of the expanding fireball. The
presence of a hot deconfined medium may also affect heavy-quark hadronization,
being possible for them to recombine with the surrounding light thermal
partons, so that the final heavy-flavour hadrons inherit part of the flow of
the medium. Here we show how it is possible to develop a complete transport
setup allowing one to describe heavy-flavour production in high-energy nuclear
collisions, displaying some major results one can obtain. Finally, the
possibility that the formation of a hot deconfined medium even in small systems

to several open questions. On the one hand it is yet unclear whether the
asynchronous state observed in the brain is autonomously generated, or if it
results from the interplay between external drivings and internal dynamics. It
is also not known, which kind of network variabilities will lead to irregular
spiking and which to synchronous firing states. Here we show how isolated
networks of purely excitatory neurons generically show asynchronous firing
whenever a minimal level of structural variability is present together with a
refractory period. Our autonomous networks are composed of excitable units, in
the form of leaky integrators spiking only in response to driving inputs. For a
non-uniform network, composed exclusively of excitatory neurons, we find a rich
repertoire of self-induced dynamical states, including asynchronous drifting
states, fully synchronized, or mixed, containing both drifting and synchronized
components. The individual neurons considered are excitable and hence do not
dispose of intrinsic natural firing frequencies. An effective network-wide
distribution of natural frequencies is however generated autonomously through
self-consistent feedback loops. We find two types of asynchronous activity,
with the individual neurons spiking regularly in the pure drifting state,
albeit with a continuous distribution of firing frequencies. The activity of
the drifting component, however, becomes irregular in the mixed state, due to
the periodic driving of the synchronized component. We propose a new tool for
the study of chaos in spiking neural networks, which consists of an analysis of
the time series of pairs of consecutive interspike intervals. In this space, we
show that a strange attractor with a fractal dimension is formed.

modelling approach to systematically study scenarios of future power supply
systems with a high share of electricity originating from wind and solar
resources. By considering backup as a subordinate source of electricity with
energy-only costs, the approach is independent of the actual full-load hours of
the backup power plants. Applying the approach to multi-year meteorological
data for Germany, cost-optimised combinations of storage devices and backup
power are identified. We find that even in scenarios with significant excess
generation capacities there is a need for storage devices or backup power
plants with discharging power on the same order as the average load to balance
the system at all times. Furthermore, these capacities seem to be required in
some years of the multi-year period only. Our results imply that the societal
need of having electricity available at all times can likely be satisfied by
installing over-capacities only, whereas a balance has to be found between
installing additional backup or storage or generation capacities.

Accordingly, passing a current in a material with strong spin-orbit coupling

charge-to-spin interconversion mechanisms offers a variety of novel spintronics
functionalities and devices, some of which do not require any ferromagnetic

interface-driven spin-orbit coupling mechanism - the Rashba effect - in the
oxide two-dimensional electron system (2DES) LaAlO3/SrTiO3 to achieve
spin-to-charge conversion with unprecedented efficiency. Through spin-pumping,
we inject a spin current from a NiFe film into the oxide 2DES and detect the

heavy-ion physics program. In 2013, LHCb has demonstrated its capabilities to
operate successfully in p-Pb and Pb-p collisions, leading already to several
important publications in the field. The measurements of the nuclear
modification factor and forward-backward production of prompt and displaced
J/$\psi$, $\psi$(2S) and $\Upsilon$(1S) states, as well as the production of
prompt $D^{0}$ mesons, have allowed to extend the knowledge of Cold Nuclear
Matter effects on open heavy flavours and quarkonium production. The
measurement of Z-boson production, important to constrain nuclear PDFs, and the
measurement of two-particle angular correlations, probing collective effects in
the dense environment of high energy collisions, have also been performed.
Furthermore, LHCb is the only experiment at the LHC that can be operated in
fixed-target mode, owing to the injection of a small amount of gas inside the
LHCb collision area. There have been several p-gas and Pb-gas data taking
periods during Run 1 and beginning of Run 2. This fixed target programme is
conducted at a center-of-mass energy of $\mathcal{O}$(100 GeV), and has great
potential to bridge the gap of knowledge between SPS and RHIC in the domain of
Quark Gluon Plasma physics. Finally, LHCb successfully participated to its
first Pb-Pb data taking at the end of 2015. First studies show that up to
semi-central Pb-Pb collisions can be successfully analysed to provide unique
measurements in the forward region. In this proceeding, we will present a
selection of LHCb results in pA collisions. We will also give some prospects
for fixed target and Pb-Pb studies.

Here, we first introduce a general regularized Logistic Regression (LR)
framework with regularized term $\lambda \|\bm{w}\|_1 +
\eta\bm{w}^T\bm{M}\bm{w}$, which can reduce to different penalties, including
Lasso, elastic net, and network-regularized terms with different $\bm{M}$. This
framework can be easily solved in a unified manner by a cyclic coordinate
descent algorithm which can avoid inverse matrix operation and accelerate the
computing speed. However, if those estimated $\bm{w}_i$ and $\bm{w}_j$ have
opposite signs, then the traditional network-regularized penalty may not
perform well. To address it, we introduce a novel network-regularized sparse LR
model with a new penalty $\lambda \|\bm{w}\|_1 + \eta|\bm{w}|^T\bm{M}|\bm{w}|$
to consider the difference between the absolute values of the coefficients. And
we develop two efficient algorithms to solve it. Finally, we test our methods

their efficiency.

broad emission line at 6.7 keV and two absorption edges at 0.87 and 8.82 keV
were detected. We found that a self-consistent reflection model fits the 0.3-60

originating from the inner region of the accretion disc, a Comptonised direct
emission coming from a corona with an electron temperature of $2.63 \pm 0.06$
keV and an optical depth $\tau=13.6 \pm 0.2$, and, finally, a reflection

and formation time uniquely, {\em provided} we know the relative fugacities of
quarks and gluons. This also provides that a smaller formation time would imply
larger fugacities for partons. Next we explore the limits of chemical
equilibration of partons during the initial stages in relativistic collision of
heavy nuclei. The experimentally measured rapidity densities of transverse
energy and charged particle multiplicity at RHIC and LHC energies are used to
estimate the energy and number densities with the assumption of formation of a
thermally equilibrated quark gluon plasma which may be chemically equilibrated
to the same or differing extents for quarks and gluons. The estimates are found
to be very sensitive to the correction factor used for the Bj\""{o}rken energy
density for identifying it with the initial energy density. The extent of
chemical equilibration near the end of the QGP phase is inferred by solving
master equations by including the processes $gg \leftrightarrow ggg$ and $gg
\leftrightarrow q\overline{q}$ along with expansion and cooling of the plasma.
The possible consequences for invariant mass distribution of intermediate mass
dileptons radiated from the plasma are discussed which could distinguish

may be written as a sum of primes. In particular, an asymptotic form P_as(n)
valid for n towards infinity is obtained analytically using standard techniques
of quantum statistical mechanics. First, the bosonic partition function of
primes, or the generating function of unrestricted prime partitions in number
theory, is constructed. Next, the density of states is obtained using the
saddle-point method for Laplace inversion of the partition function in the
limit of large n. This directly gives the asymptotic number of prime partitions
P_as(n). The leading term in the asymptotic expression grows exponentially as
sqrt[n/ln(n)] and agrees with previous estimates. We calculate the
next-to-leading order term in the exponent, porportional to ln[ln(n)]/ln(n),
and show that an earlier result in the literature for its coefficient is
incorrect. Furthermore, we also calculate the next higher order correction,
proportional to 1/ln(n) and given in Eq.(43), which so far has not been
available in the literature. Finally, we compare our analytical results with
the exact numerical values of P(n) up to n \sim 8 10^6. For the highest values,
the remaining error between the exact P(n) and our P_as(n) is only about half
of that obtained with the leading-order (LO) approximation. But we also show
that, unlike for other types of partitions, the asymptotic limit for the prime
partitions is still quite far from being reached even for n \sim 10^7.

process of identifying object outlines within images. There are a number of
efficient algorithms for segmentation in Euclidean space that depend on the
variational approach and partial differential equation modelling. Wavelets have
been used successfully in various problems in image processing, including
segmentation, inpainting, noise removal, super-resolution image restoration,
and many others. Wavelets on the sphere have been developed to solve such
problems for data defined on the sphere, which arise in numerous fields such as
cosmology and geophysics. In this work, we propose a wavelet-based method to
segment images on the sphere, accounting for the underlying geometry of
spherical data. Our method is a direct extension of the tight-frame based
segmentation method used to automatically identify tube-like structures such as
blood vessels in medical imaging. It is compatible with any arbitrary type of
wavelet frame defined on the sphere, such as axisymmetric wavelets, directional
wavelets, curvelets, and hybrid wavelet constructions. Such an approach allows
the desirable properties of wavelets to be naturally inherited in the
segmentation process. In particular, directional wavelets and curvelets, which
were designed to efficiently capture directional signal content, provide
additional advantages in segmenting images containing prominent directional and
curvilinear features. We present several numerical experiments, applying our
wavelet-based segmentation method, as well as the common K-means method, on
real-world spherical images. These experiments demonstrate the superiority of
our method and show that it is capable of segmenting different kinds of
spherical images, including those with prominent directional features.
Moreover, our algorithm is efficient with convergence usually within a few
iterations.

particles are typically a signal of new physics. In this work we propose a
scenario wherein these edges could be utilised in discriminating between
different classes of models. To this effect, we consider the resonant
production of a heavy Higgs like resonance (H 1 ) as a case study. Such states
are a characteristic feature of many new physics scenarios beyond the Standard
Model (SM). In the event of a discovery, it is essential to identify the true
nature of the underlying theory. In this work we propose a channel, $H_1
\rightarrow t_2 t$, where t_2 is a vector-like gauge singlet top-partner that
decays into W b, Zt, ht. Invariant mass distributions constructed out of these
final states are characterized by the presence of kinematic edges, which are
unique to the topology under consideration. Further, since all the final state
particles are SM states, the position in the edges of these invariant mass
distributions can be used to exclusively determine the masses of the
resonances. Observation of these features are meant to serve as a trigger,
thereby mandating a more detailed analysis in a particular direction of
parameter space. The absence of these edge like features, in the specific
invariant mass distributions considered here, in minimal versions of
supersymmetric models (MSSM) also serves as a harbinger of such non MSSM-like
scenarios.

element is easily destroyed in the high temperatures of the stellar interiors.
In spite of this fact, several of these stars are Li-rich, having Li abundances
given by log (Li/H) + 12 > 1.5. In the present work, we extend our previous
investigation on AGB/RGB stars to the expected mass loss rates of these stars.
Specifically, we look for correlations between the Li abundances and the mass
loss rates or related parameters in Li-rich AGB/RGB stars. We have estimated
the mass loss rates using a modified form of the Reimers formula and applied it
to a large sample of 104 Li-rich giant stars for which reliable stellar data
are available. Our proposed method assumes a linear relation between the
stellar luminosity and the Li abundance, so that the luminosity can be
estimated from the Li abundance. The stellar mass is then obtained from the
effective temperature and luminosity using recent evolutionary tracks. The
stellar radius can be determined from the stellar gravity, so that the mass
loss rate can be calculated using an adequate calibration involving both
Li-rich and Li-poor stars in the AGB/RGB branches. The results show that most
Li-rich stars have lower mass loss rates compared with C-rich or O-rich giants
that do not present Li enhancements.

patterns on the dynamics of disease transmission is not fully understood. In
order to study their role in the context of Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible

networks (N=49) from distinct, closed, directed triadic subpatterns. We compare
various global properties of TRGs and use the N-intertwined mean-field

very similar behavior to TRGs with an abundance of (directed) feed-back-loops,

slows down the epidemic and lowers the number of infected individuals in the
endemic state. Moreover, we introduce a novel stochastic approach for modelling
the SIS-epidemics on TRGs based on characterizing nodes according to their set
of $\left(k_{in},k_{out}\right)$ within triads. Within this model, the topology
of the network is given by the number and the local structure of directed
triadic motifs and not by the adjacency matrix. Nevertheless, the outcome of
simulations is qualitatively similar to the results of the NIMFA model.

(UEs) have a two-way communication with a common Base Station (BS) in the
presence of a buffer-equipped Relay Station (RS). Each of the uplink (UL) and
downlink (DL) transmission can take place over a direct or over a relayed path.
Traditionally, the UL and the DL path of a given two-way link are coupled, that
is, either both are direct links or both are relayed links. By removing the
restriction for coupling, one opens the design space for a decoupled two-way
links. Following this, we devise two protocols: orthogonal decoupled UL/DL
buffer-aided (ODBA) relaying protocol and non-orthogonal decoupled UL/DL
buffer-aided (NODBA) relaying protocol. In NODBA, the receiver can use
successive interference cancellation (SIC) to extract the desired signal from a
collision between UL and DL signals. For both protocols, we characterize the
transmission decision policies in terms of maximization of the average two-way
sum rate of the system. The numerical results show that decoupling association
and non-orthogonal radio access lead to significant throughput gains for
two-way traffic.

force and mass sensing experiments. The force sensitivity in these ultra-light

heating induced by the measurement. Here, we strongly couple multilayer
graphene resonators to superconducting cavities in order to achieve a
displacement sensitivity of $1.3$ fm Hz$^{-1/2}$. This coupling also allows us
to damp the resonator to an average phonon occupation of $7.2$. Our best force

balancing measurement imprecision, optomechanical damping, and heating. Our

network by choosing a fixed number of initial seeds --- a central problem in
the study of network cascades. The majority of existing work on this problem,
formally referred to as the influence maximization problem, is designed for
submodular cascades. Despite the empirical evidence that many cascades are
non-submodular, little work has been done focusing on non-submodular influence
maximization.
  We propose a new heuristic for solving the influence maximization problem and
show via simulations on real-world and synthetic networks that our algorithm
outputs more influential seed sets than the state-of-the-art greedy algorithm
in many natural cases, with average improvements of 7% for submodular cascades,
and 55% for non-submodular cascades. Our heuristic uses a dynamic programming
approach on a hierarchical decomposition of the social network to leverage the
relation between the spread of cascades and the community structure of social
networks. We verify the importance of network structure by showing the quality
of the hierarchical decomposition impacts the quality of seed set output by our
algorithm. We also present ""worst-case"" theoretical results proving that in
certain settings our algorithm outputs seed sets that are a factor of
$\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ more influential than those of the greedy algorithm, where
$n$ is the number of nodes in the network. Finally, we generalize our algorithm
to a message passing version that can be used to find seed sets that have at
least as much influence as the dynamic programming algorithms.

source schema into data structured under another schema, called the target
schema, so that both the source and target data satisfy the relationship
between the schemas. Even though the formal framework of data exchange for
relational database systems is well-established, it does not immediately carry
over to the settings of temporal data, which necessitates reasoning over
unbounded periods of time. In this work, we study data exchange for temporal
data. We first motivate the need for two views of temporal data: the concrete
view, which depicts how temporal data is compactly represented and on which the
implementations are based, and the abstract view, which defines the semantics
of temporal data as a sequence of snapshots. We first extend the chase
procedure for the abstract view to have a conceptual basis for the data
exchange for temporal databases. Considering non-temporal source-to-target
tuple generating dependencies and equality generating dependencies, the chase
algorithm can be applied on each snapshot independently. Then we define a chase
procedure (called c-chase) on concrete instances and show the result of c-chase
on a concrete instance is semantically aligned with the result of chase on the
corresponding abstract instance. In order to interpret intervals as constants
while checking if a dependency or a query is satisfied by a concrete database,
we will normalize the instance with respect to the dependency or the query. To
obtain the semantic alignment, the nulls in the concrete view are annotated
with temporal information. Furthermore, we show that the result of the concrete
chase provides a foundation for query answering. We define naive evaluation on
the result of the c-chase and show it produces certain answers.

system for realizing quantum computing. The short coherence time of the
electronic quantum state that arises from coupling to the nuclei of the
substrate is dramatically increased if the system is subjected to a magnetic
field and to repeated optical pulsing. This enhancement is due to mode locking:
Oscillation frequencies resonant with the pulsing frequencies are enhanced,
while off-resonant oscillations eventually die out. Because the resonant
frequencies are determined by the pulsing frequency only, the system becomes
immune to frequency shifts caused by the nuclear coupling and by slight
variations between individual quantum dots. The effects remain even after the
optical pulsing is terminated. In this work, we explore the phenomenon of mode
locking from a quantum mechanical perspective. We treat the dynamics using the
central spin model, which includes coupling to 10-20 nuclei and incoherent
decay of the excited electronic state, in a perturbative framework. Using
scaling arguments, we extrapolate our results to realistic system parameters.

studied theoretically in presence of an external time harmonic scalar
potential. The transmission coefficients are calculated in the framework of the
non-perturbative Floquet theory using transfer matrix method. The time
dependent scalar potential is found to suppress the usual Fabry-Perot
oscillations occurring in the transmission through a constant vector potential
barrier (corresponding to two oppositely directed delta-function magnetic
barriers). Two types of asymmetric Fano resonances (FR) are noted and are
discussed for the narrow barrier structure. One of them arises due to the
oscillatory mode while the other due to the evanescent mode of the electron
wave inside the barrier. In contrast, the oscillating field favors the
transmission for rectangular magnetic barrier structure and also exhibits the
FR due to the presence of bound state inside the barrier. The characteristic
Fano line shape can be tuned by varying the amplitude of the oscillating
potential. The detection of such FR offers an efficient tool for the
identification of the quasi-bound and evanescent extended states inside the
barrier not reported in the literature so far, for the case of graphene
magnetic barrier structures.

cool neutral hydrogen (HI) gas, namely 3C 293, 3C 305 and 4C 12.50 (PKS

the galaxy. For this, we use deep optical V-band imaging of the host galaxies,
complemented with HI emission-line observations to study their gaseous
environments. We find prominent optical tidal features in all three radio
galaxies, which confirm previous claims that 3C 293, 3C 305 and 4C 12.50 have
been involved in a recent galaxy merger or interaction. Our data show the
complex morphology of the host galaxies, and identify the companion galaxies
that are likely involved in the merger or interaction. The radio sources appear
to be (re-)triggered at a different stage of the merger; 4C 12.50 is a
pre-coalescent and possibly multiple merger, 3C 293 is a post-coalescent merger
that is undergoing a minor interaction with a close satellite galaxy, while 3C
305 appears to be shaped by an interaction with a gas-rich companion. For 3C
293 and 3C 305, we do not detect HI beyond the inner ~30-45 kpc region, which
shows that the bulk of the cold gas is concentrated within the host-galaxy,

Interestingly, the impedance of the three-terminal gyrator can be made
arbitrarily small for certain coupling strengths, so that no auxiliary

the impedance decreases, it can be improved by reducing the magnetic field; it
can be realistically increased up to $ 150 \mathrm{MHz}$ at $50\mathrm{\Omega}$
by working at filling factor $\nu=10$. We examine also the effects of the
parasitic capacitive coupling between electrodes and we find that, although in
general they strongly influence the response of device, their effect is
negligible at low impedance. Finally, we analyze an interferometric
implementation of a circulator, which incorporates the gyrator in a
Mach-Zender-like construction. Perfect circulation in both directions can be
achieved, depending on frequency and on the details of the interferometer.

study of an HC structure in the metric wavelength. The associated radio
emission manifests as a moving type-IV (t-IVm) burst. We show that the radio

that evolves considerably with time. This study demonstrates the possibility of
imaging the eruptive HC structure at the metric wavelength and provides strong
constraints on the t-IV emision mechanism, which, if understood, can be used to
diagnose the essential parameters of the eruptive structure.

super-rotation. However, the atmospheric mechanisms responsible for the
formation of this super-rotation are still not fully understood. In this work,
we developed a new Venus general circulation model to study the most likely
mechanisms driving the atmosphere to the current observed circulation. Our
model includes a new radiative transfer, convection and suitably adapted
boundary layer schemes and a dynamical core that takes into account the
dependence of the heat capacity at constant pressure with temperature.
  The new Venus model is able to simulate a super-rotation phenomenon in the
cloud region quantitatively similar to the one observed. The mechanisms
maintaining the strong winds in the cloud region were found in the model
results to be a combination of zonal mean circulation, thermal tides and
transient waves. In this process, the semi-diurnal tide excited in the upper
clouds has a key contribution in transporting axial angular momentum mainly
from the upper atmosphere towards the cloud region. The magnitude of the
super-rotation in the cloud region is sensitive to various radiative parameters
such as the amount of solar radiative energy absorbed by the surface, which
controls the static stability near the surface. In this work, we also discuss
the main difficulties in representing the flow below the cloud base in Venus
atmospheric models.
  Our new radiative scheme is more suitable for 3D Venus climate models than
those used in previous work due to its easy adaptability to different
atmospheric conditions. This flexibility of the model was crucial to explore
the uncertainties in the lower atmospheric conditions and may also be used in
the future to explore, for example, dynamical-radiative-microphysical
feedbacks.

$^{3}$He-going) direction, the relative yield of $\psi(2S)$ mesons to
$\psi(1S)$ mesons is consistent with the value measured in \pp collisions.
However, in the backward (nucleus-going) direction, the $\psi(2S)$ is
preferentially suppressed by a factor of $\sim$2. This suppression is
attributed in some models to breakup of the weakly-bound $\psi(2S)$ through
final state interactions with comoving particles, which have a higher density
in the nucleus-going direction. These breakup effects may compete with color
screening in a deconfined quark-gluon plasma to produce sequential suppression
of excited quarkonia states.

converted into H due to the isotopic exchange reaction T+H$_2\rightarrow$TH+H.
The maximum concentrations of unpaired T and H atoms was limited by their
recombination which becomes enforced by efficient atomic diffusion due to a
presence of a large number of vacancies and phonons generated in the matrices
by $\beta$-particles. Recombination also appeared in an explosive manner both
being stimulated and spontaneously in thick films where sample cooling was
insufficient. We suggest that the main mechanism for H and T migration is
physical diffusion related to tunneling or hopping to vacant sites in contrast

phase transitions, these phase transitions are induced by tuning the strength
of the dissipation in a non-Hermitian system and can occur even at finite size.
For conventional phase transitions, universal behaviors in driven dynamics
across critical points are usually described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism,
which states that the scaling in dynamics is dictated by the critical exponents
associated with one critical point and topological defects will emerge after
the quench. While the mechanism leading to topological defects breaks down in
the YLES, we find that for small lattice size, the driven dynamics can still be
described by the Kibble-Zurek scaling with the exponents determined by the
$(0+1)$-dimensional YLES. For medium finite size, however, the driven dynamics
can be described by the Kibble-Zurek scaling with two sets of critical

summarize opinions of a product, and the current state-of-the-art is achieved
with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based model. Although social media data
like tweets are laden with opinions, their ""dirty"" nature (as natural language)
has discouraged researchers from applying LDA-based opinion model for product
review mining. Tweets are often informal, unstructured and lacking labeled data
such as categories and ratings, making it challenging for product opinion
mining. In this paper, we propose an LDA-based opinion model named Twitter
Opinion Topic Model (TOTM) for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. TOTM
leverages hashtags, mentions, emoticons and strong sentiment words that are
present in tweets in its discovery process. It improves opinion prediction by
modeling the target-opinion interaction directly, thus discovering target
specific opinion words, neglected in existing approaches. Moreover, we propose
a new formulation of incorporating sentiment prior information into a topic
model, by utilizing an existing public sentiment lexicon. This is novel in that
it learns and updates with the data. We conduct experiments on 9 million tweets
on electronic products, and demonstrate the improved performance of TOTM in
both quantitative evaluations and qualitative analysis. We show that
aspect-based opinion analysis on massive volume of tweets provides useful
opinions on products.

however, the fine-grained collection of user locations raises serious privacy

paper, we study the feasibility of crowd-sourced mobility analytics over
aggregate location information: users periodically report their location, using
a privacy-preserving aggregation protocol, so that the server can only recover

Transport For London authority and the San Francisco Cabs network, and present
a novel methodology based on time series modeling that is geared to forecast
traffic volumes in regions of interest and to detect mobility anomalies in
them. In the presence of anomalies, we also make enhanced traffic volume
predictions by feeding our model with additional information from correlated

dichotomy between structure and randomness. In this paper we will provide an

considerable practical importance for various real-world applications. Arguably
several thousands of papers are dedicated to image denoising. In the past
decade, sate-of-the-art denoising algorithm have been clearly dominated by
non-local patch-based methods, which explicitly exploit patch self-similarity
within image. However, in recent two years, discriminatively trained local
approaches have started to outperform previous non-local models and have been
attracting increasing attentions due to the additional advantage of
computational efficiency. Successful approaches include cascade of shrinkage
fields (CSF) and trainable nonlinear reaction diffusion (TNRD). These two
methods are built on filter response of linear filters of small size using feed
forward architectures. Due to the locality inherent in local approaches, the
CSF and TNRD model become less effective when noise level is high and
consequently introduces some noise artifacts. In order to overcome this
problem, in this paper we introduce a multi-scale strategy. To be specific, we
build on our newly-developed TNRD model, adopting the multi-scale pyramid image
representation to devise a multi-scale nonlinear diffusion process. As
expected, all the parameters in the proposed multi-scale diffusion model,
including the filters and the influence functions across scales, are learned
from training data through a loss based approach. Numerical results on Gaussian
and Poisson denoising substantiate that the exploited multi-scale strategy can
successfully boost the performance of the original TNRD model with single
scale. As a consequence, the resulting multi-scale diffusion models can
significantly suppress the typical incorrect features for those noisy images
with heavy noise.

$M_\mathrm{D}/m$. The horizontal sizes of investigated toroids range from c. 50

their mass $M_\mathrm{D} \in (10^{-4}m, 40m)$ and the radial size of the system

Those simulations yield the coronal structure as well as the instant torque

characterization of wave motion in lattice structures is currently of great
interest due its relevance to the design of novel mechanical metamaterials with
unique/unusual properties such as strongly directional behavior, negative
refractive indexes and topologically protected wave motion. Assessment of these
functionalities often requires the detection of highly spatially resolved
in-plane wavefields, which for reticulated or porous structural assemblies is
an open challenge. A Digital Image Correlation approach is implemented that
tracks small displacements of the lattice nodes by centering image subsets
about the lattice intersections. A high speed camera records the motion of the
points by properly interleaving subsequent frames thus artificially enhancing
the available sampling rate. This, along with an imaging stitching procedure,
enables the capturing of a field of view that is sufficiently large for
subsequent processing. The transient response is recorded in the form of the
full wavefields, which are processed to unveil features of wave motion in a
hexagonal lattice. Time snapshots and frequency contours in the spatial Fourier
domain are compared with numerical predictions to illustrate the accuracy of
the recorded wavefields and demonstrate the suitability of this technique for

  equations",,,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Proca potential has been used in many contexts in flat spacetime, but not
so often in curved spacetime. Here, the static Proca potentials are derived on
a Schwarzschild background, and are found to have very different forms from
those in flat space. In addition, the coupling of the two fields leads to a
quantum condition on the particle mass, which is found to be quantized and
inversely proportional to the range parameter, $\mu$. This suggests that
gravity may induce quantization in other physical fields.

counterexamples in bounded model checking, based on parallel runs over versions
of a system in which features have been randomly disabled. As shown in previous
work, adding constraints to a bounded model checking problem can reduce the
size of the verification problem and dramatically decrease the time required to
find counterexample. Adapting a technique developed in software testing to this
problem provides a simple way to produce useful partial verification problems,
with a resulting decrease in average time until a counterexample is produced.
If no counterexample is found, partial verification results can also be useful
in practice.
