uplink and downlink communications between the mobile devices and the UAV that

programming languages, due to its inherent complexity. However, many mainstream
programming and markup languages (C, Haskell, Python, XML, and more) possess
context-sensitive features. These features are traditionally handled with
ad-hoc code (e.g., custom lexers), outside of the scope of parsing theory.
  Current grammar formalisms struggle to express context-sensitive features.
Most solutions lack context transparency: they make grammars hard to write,
maintain and compose by hardwiring context through the entire grammar. Instead,
we approach context-sensitive parsing through the idea that parsers may recall
previously matched input (or data derived therefrom) in order to make parsing
decisions. We make use of mutable parse state to enable this form of recall.
  We introduce principled stateful parsing as a new transactional discipline
that makes state changes transparent to parsing mechanisms such as backtracking
and memoization. To enforce this discipline, users specify parsers using
formally specified primitive state manipulation operations.
  Our solution is available as a parsing library named Autumn. We illustrate
our solution by implementing some practical context-sensitive grammar features
such as significant whitespace handling and namespace classification.

based on electron field emission from a nano-eimtter to another opposite
electrode through a vacuum channel. Geometrically asymmetric metal-vacuum-metal
structures were demonstrated to have energy conversion ability for elec-
tromagnetic waves in the optical range. Combining the ability of these
structures to convert optical signals into recti ed current and the ability of
vacuum nanotriodes to control the eld emission current can allow direct
processing on converted optical signals using a single device. In this paper, a
three-dimensional quantum-mechanical method, rather than the approximate
Fowler-Nordheim theory, is used for modeling the eld emission process in
vertical-type vacuum nanotriodes consisting of an emitter, a collector and a
gate. The electron transport through the device is computed using a
transfer-matrix technique. The potentials of vacuum nanotriodes in the current
recti cation and modulation are investigated at low volt- ages. The e ects of
varying the structure geometrical parameters on the recti ed current are also
studied. The obtained results show that a great enhancement in the recti cation
properties is achievable when the gate and the collector are connected through
a DC source. It is also demonstrated that a small variation in the gate voltage
can be used either to modulate the recti ed current or to switch the device
into a resonant tunneling diode.26

the exact likelihood is permutation-invariant. This article takes the
alternative standpoint that the ordering of the observations can be tuned to
sharpen the approximations. Advantageously chosen orderings can drastically
improve the approximations, and in fact, completely random orderings often
produce far more accurate approximations than default coordinate-based
orderings do. In addition to the permutation results, automatic methods for
grouping calculations of components of the approximation are introduced, having
the result of simultaneously improving the quality of the approximation and
reducing its computational burden. In common settings, reordering combined with
grouping reduces Kullback-Leibler divergence from the target model by a factor
of 80 and computation time by a factor of 2 compared to ungrouped
approximations with default ordering. The claims are supported by theory and
numerical results with comparisons to other approximations, including tapered
covariances and stochastic partial differential equation approximations.
Computational details are provided, including efficiently finding the orderings
and ordered nearest neighbors, and profiling out linear mean parameters and
using the approximations for prediction and conditional simulation. An

most cases, the comparable magnitudes of velocity dispersion and projected
rotation result in degeneracies that prohibit unambiguous circular velocity
solutions. We thus make spatially resolved position-velocity cuts, corrected
for inclination using the stellar components, to estimate the circular rotation
velocities. We find circular velocities <30 km/s for the entire survey

There exists an empirical threshold rotational velocity <15 km/s, below which

survey as potential gas-bearing dark matter halos. Here we present higher
resolution neutral hydrogen (HI) observations of twelve UCHVCS with the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). The UCHVCs were selected based on
a combination of size, isolation, large recessional velocity and high column
density as the best candidate dark matter halos. The WSRT data were tapered to
image the UCHVCs at 210"" (comparable to Arecibo) and 105"" angular resolution.
In a comparison of the single-dish to interferometer data, we find that the
line flux recovered in the WSRT observations is comparable to that from the
single-dish ALFALFA data. In addition, any structure seen in the ALFALFA data
is reproduced in the WSRT maps at the same angular resolution. At 210'""
resolution all the sources are generally compact with a smooth HI morphology,
as expected from their identification as UCHVCs. At the higher angular
resolution, a majority of the sources break into small clumps contained in a
diffuse envelope. These UCHVCs also have no ordered velocity motion and are
most likely Galactic halo clouds. We identify two UCHVCs, AGC 198606 and AGC
249525, as excellent galaxy candidates based on maintaining a smooth HI
morphology at higher angular resolution and showing ordered velocity motion
consistent with rotation. A third source, AGC 249565, lies between these two
populations in properties and is a possible galaxy candidate. If interpreted as
gas-bearing dark matter halos, the three candidate galaxies have rotation
velocities of 8-15 km/s, HI masses of 0.6-50 x 10^5 Msun, HI radii of 0.3-2
kpc, and dynamical masses of 2-20 x 10^7 Msun for a range of plausible
distances. These are the UCHVCs with the highest column density values in the
ALFALFA HI data and we suggest this is the best way to identify further
candidates.

insights on the modeling and analysis of information dissemination over
networks and physical systems. This paper studies the importance of follower
links for event propagation on Twitter. Three recent event propagation traces
are collected with the Twitter user language field being used to identify the
Network of Networks (NoN) structure embedded in the Twitter follower networks.
We first formulate event propagation on Twitter as an iterative state equation,
and then propose an effective score function on follower links accounting for
the containment of event propagation via link removals. Furthermore, we find
that utilizing the NoN model can successfully identify influential follower
links such that their removals lead to a remarkable reduction in event
propagation on Twitter follower networks. Experimental results find that the
between-network follower links, though only account for a small portion of the
total follower links, are crucial to event propagation on Twitter.

subject to interface jump conditions, is presented. In general, such problems
pose issues for standard finite difference solvers, as the inherent
discontinuity in the solution results in erroneous derivative information
wherever the stencils straddle the given interface. Here, however, the recently
proposed Correction Function Method (CFM) is used, in which correction terms
are computed from the interface conditions, and added to affected nodes to
compensate for the discontinuity. In contrast to existing methods, these
corrections are not simply defined at affected nodes, but rather generalized to
a continuous function within a small region surrounding the interface. As a
result, the correction function may be defined in terms of its own governing
partial differential equation (PDE) which may be solved, in principle, to
arbitrary order of accuracy. The resulting scheme is not only arbitrarily high
order, but also robust, having already seen application to Poisson problems and
the heat equation. By extending the CFM to this new class of PDEs, the
treatment of wave interface discontinuities in homogeneous media becomes
possible. This allows, for example, for the straightforward treatment of
infinitesimal source terms and sharp boundaries, free of staircasing errors.
Additionally, new modifications to the CFM are derived, allowing compatibility
with explicit multi-step methods, such as Runge-Kutta (RK4), without a
reduction in accuracy. These results are then verified through numerous
numerical experiments in one and two spatial dimensions.

diagrammatic languages. The archetypal network-style diagrammatic language is
that of electric circuits; other examples include signal flow graphs, Markov
processes, automata, Petri nets, chemical reaction networks, and so on. The key
feature is that the language is comprised of a number of components with
multiple (input/output) terminals, each possibly labelled with some type, that
may then be connected together along these terminals to form a larger network.
The components form hyperedges between labelled vertices, and so a diagram in
this language forms a hypergraph. We formalise the compositional structure by
introducing the notion of a hypergraph category. Network-style diagrammatic
languages and their semantics thus form hypergraph categories, and semantic
interpretation gives a hypergraph functor.
  The first part of this thesis develops the theory of hypergraph categories.
In particular, we introduce the tools of decorated cospans and corelations.
Decorated cospans allow straightforward construction of hypergraph categories
from diagrammatic languages: the inputs, outputs, and their composition are
modelled by the cospans, while the 'decorations' specify the components
themselves. Not all hypergraph categories can be constructed, however, through
decorated cospans. Decorated corelations are a more powerful version that
permits construction of all hypergraph categories and hypergraph functors.
These are often useful for constructing the semantic categories of diagrammatic
languages and functors from diagrams to the semantics. To illustrate these
principles, the second part of this thesis details applications to linear
time-invariant dynamical systems and passive linear networks.

the developed model is utilized to characterize the extent to which cellular

the work is to understand 1) if, 2) to what extent, and possibly 3) how, the

environment made of a large number of spin-1/2 particles, coupled with a
quantum mechanical oscillator, possibly in the presence of an external magnetic
field. We take the value of the total environmental-spin S constant and large,
which allows us to consider the environment as one single macroscopic system,
and further deal with the hurdles of the spin-algebra via approximations that
are valid in the large-S limit. We find an insightful expression for the
propagator of the whole system, where we identify an effective ""back-action""
term, i.e. an operator acting on the magnetic environment only, and yet missing
in the absence of the quantum principal system. This operator emerges as a
time-dependent magnetic anisotropy whose character, whether uniaxial or planar,
also depends on the detuning between the level-splitting in the spectrum of the
free magnetic system, induced by the possible presence of the external field,
and the frequency of the oscillator. The time-dependence of the anisotropy is
analysed, and its effects on the dynamics of the magnet, as well as its

schemes and algorithms with feedback for wireless networks equipped with
buffer-aided relays. The proposed schemes employ a maximum likelihood receiver
at the destination and adjustable codes subject to a power constraint with an
amplify-and-forward cooperative strategy at the relays. Each relay is equipped
with a buffer and is capable of storing blocks of received symbols and
forwarding the data to the destination if selected. Different antenna
configurations and wireless channels, such as static block fading channels, are
considered. The effects of using buffer-aided relays to improve the bit error
rate (BER) performance are also studied. Adjustable relay selection and
optimization algorithms that exploit the extra degrees of freedom of relays
equipped with buffers are developed to improve the BER performance. We also
analyze the pairwise error probability and diversity of the system when using
the proposed schemes and algorithms in a cooperative network. Simulation
results show that the proposed schemes and algorithms obtain performance gains
over previously reported techniques.

manifested as small changes in the network structure. An important question is
whether these small changes can significantly affect the analysis results. In
this paper, we study the effect of noise in changing ranks of the high
centrality vertices. We compare, using the Jaccard Index (JI), how many of the
top-k high centrality nodes from the original network are also part of the
top-k ranked nodes from the noisy network. We deem a network as stable if the
JI value is high. We observe two features that affect the stability. First, the
stability is dependent on the number of top-ranked vertices considered. When
the vertices are ordered according to their centrality values, they group into
clusters. Perturbations to the network can change the relative ranking within
the cluster, but vertices rarely move from one cluster to another. Second, the
stability is dependent on the local connections of the high ranking vertices.
The network is highly stable if the high ranking vertices are connected to each
other. Our findings show that the stability of a network is affected by the
local properties of high centrality vertices, rather than the global properties
of the entire network. Based on these local properties we can identify the
stability of a network, without explicitly applying a noise model.

  The F-noetherian property is preserved under some \emph{skew} quantum ring
extensions including some iterated Ore extensions, some skew-Laurent
extensions, and some quantum almost-normalizing extensions. For example, let R=
S[ x_1, ..., x_n ] be a finitely generated ring \textit {over a subring S} such

unprecedented accuracy. We observe that the absence of apical oxygens increases
the in-plane hopping range and, in CaCuO2, it leads to a genuine 3D

field lines are pushed upwards at the pre-flare stage, the light wall turns to
the vertical direction, resulting in the increase of the light wall's
projective oscillation amplitude. After the magnetic reconnection takes place,
a group of new field lines with smaller scales are formed underneath the
reconnection site and the light wall inclines. Thus, the projective amplitude
decreases remarkably at the post-flare stage.

topological nodal line semimetals in three dimensions. In these semimetals, the
conduction and the valence bands cross each other along a one-dimensional curve
in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone, and any perturbation that preserves a
certain symmetry group (generated by either spatial symmetries or time-reversal
symmetry) cannot remove this crossing line and open a full direct gap between
the two bands. The nodal line(s) is hence topologically protected by the
symmetry group, and can be associated with a topological invariant. In this
Review, (i) we enumerate the symmetry groups that may protect a topological
nodal line; (ii) we write down the explicit form of the topological invariant
for each of these symmetry groups in terms of the wave functions on the Fermi
surface, establishing a topological classification; (iii) for certain classes,
we review the proposals for the realization of these semimetals in real
materials and (iv) we discuss different scenarios that when the protecting
symmetry is broken, how a topological nodal line semimetal becomes Weyl
semimetals, Dirac semimetals and other topological phases and (v) we discuss
the possible physical effects accessible to experimental probes in these
materials.

sources in nearby galaxies, we study the X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for
X-ray point sources in different types of galaxies and the statistical
properties of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). Uniform procedures are
developed to compute the detection threshold, to estimate the
foreground/background contamination, and to calculate the XLFs for individual
galaxies and groups of galaxies, resulting in an XLF library for 343 galaxies
of different types. With the large number of surveyed galaxies, we have studied
the XLFs and ULX properties across different host galaxy types, and confirm
with good statistics that the XLF slope flattens from lenticular
($\alpha\sim1.50\pm0.07$) to elliptical ($\sim1.21\pm0.02$), to spirals
($\sim0.80\pm0.02$), to peculiars ($\sim0.55\pm0.30$), and to irregulars
($\sim0.26\pm0.10$). The XLF break dividing the neutron star and black hole
binaries is also confirmed, albeit at quite different break luminosities for
different types of galaxies. A radial dependency is found for ellipticals, with
a flatter XLF slope for sources located between $D_{25}$ and 2$D_{25}$,
suggesting the XLF slopes in the outer region of early-type galaxies are
dominated by low-mass X-ray binaries in globular clusters. This study shows
that the ULX rate in early-type galaxies is $0.24\pm0.05$ ULXs per surveyed
galaxy, on a $5\sigma$ confidence level. The XLF for ULXs in late-type galaxies
extends smoothly until it drops abruptly around $4\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$,
and this break may suggest a mild boundary between the stellar black hole
population possibly including 30 $M_\odot$ black holes with super-Eddington
radiation and intermediate mass black holes.

the archetypal hydrogen absorbers Pd and LaNi5. The relationship between
dislocations and trapped hydrogen was explored using thermally induced
desorption. It was found that the dislocations in Pd caused by hydrogen
absorption anneal over a wide range of temperatures and that although they
start to anneal below 250 $^\circ$C, temperatures well above 750 $^\circ$C are
required to fully anneal the metal. It was shown that allowing further time at
lower temperatures does not further anneal the metal. It is suggested that this
is due to dislocation tangling and pinning, causing different temperatures to
be required for different pinning defects. It was found that hydrogen trapped
in LaNi5 is released in a wide range of temperatures and it was therefore
concluded that hydrogen is trapped in the dislocation strain field and
dislocation core as well as vacancies. The direct comparison of deuterium
release and dislocation density showed no correlation, in agreement with
previous indirect comparisons. Dislocations in LaNi5 were shown to anneal at
temperatures as low as 150 $^\circ$C, in contrast to previous reports which
suggested more than 500 $^\circ$C was required. This lower annealing
temperature for dislocations at least partly explains why low temperature
ageing increases the pressure hysteresis in hydrogen cycled LaNi5.

more than four derivatives, including both their quantum and classical aspects.
In this work we extend the recent results concerning the non-singularity of the
modified Newtonian potential to the most relevant case in which the propagator
has complex poles. The model we consider is Einstein-Hilbert action augmented
by curvature-squared higher-derivative terms which contain polynomials on the
d'Alembert operator. We show that the classical potential of these theories is
a real quantity and it is regular at the origin disregard the (complex or real)
nature or the multiplicity of the massive poles. The expression for the
potential is explicitly derived for some interesting particular cases. Finally,
the issue of the mechanism behind the cancellation of the singularity is
discussed; specifically we argue that the regularity of the potential can hold
even if the number of massive tensor modes and scalar ones is not the same.

the past two decades due to its sparsity-promoting properties. More recently,
its generalization to non-Euclidean domains has been found useful in shape
analysis applications. For example, in conjunction with the minimization of the
Dirichlet energy, it was shown to produce a compactly supported quasi-harmonic
orthonormal basis, dubbed as compressed manifold modes. The continuous L1 norm
on the manifold is often replaced by the vector l1 norm applied to sampled
functions. We show that such an approach is incorrect in the sense that it does
not consistently discretize the continuous norm and warn against its
sensitivity to the specific sampling. We propose two alternative
discretizations resulting in an iteratively-reweighed l2 norm. We demonstrate
the proposed strategy on the compressed modes problem, which reduces to a
sequence of simple eigendecomposition problems not requiring non-convex
optimization on Stiefel manifolds and producing more stable and accurate

In this paper, we develop an alternative, sequential definition of the Henstock

the Henstock integral as well as to the Darboux definition and to a topological
definition of the Henstock integral. We then establish the basic properties and
fundamental theorems, including two convergence theorems, for the Sequential
Henstock integral and offer suggestions for further study.

4-terminal superconducting structure where 4 chaotic cavities are connected by
QPCs to the terminals and to each other forming a ring. Such a tunable device
can be realized in 2DEG-superconductor structures.
  We concentrate on the limit of a short structure and large conductance of the
QPCs where a quasi-continuous spectrum is formed. The energies can be tuned by
the superconducting phases. We observe the opening and closing of gaps in the
spectrum. This concerns the usual proximity gap that separates the levels from
zero energy as well as less usual ""smile"" gaps that split the levels of the
spectrum.
  We demonstrate a remarkable crossover in the overall spectrum that occurs
upon changing the ratio of conductance of the inner and outer QPCs. At big
values of the ratio, the levels exhibit a generic behavior expected for the
spectrum of a disordered system manifesting level repulsion and ""Brownian
motion"" upon changing the phases. At small values of the ratio, the levels are
squeezed into narrow bunches separated by wide smile gaps. Each bunch consists
of almost degenerate ABSs.
  We study in detail the properties of the spectrum in the limit of a small
ratio, paying special attention to the crossings of bunches. We distinguish two
types of crossings: i. with a regular phase dependence of the levels and ii.
crossings where the Brownian motion of the levels leads to an apparently
irregular phase-dependence. We work out a perturbation theory to explain the
observations.
  The unusual properties of the spectrum originate from unobvious topological
effects. Topology of the first kind is related to the winding of the
semiclassical Green's function. It is responsible for the proximity gaps.
Topology of the second kind comes about the discreteness of the number of modes
and is responsible for the smile gaps.

transition to turbulence of non-rotating plane shear flows. The role of these
mechanisms in rotating channel flow is examined here in the linear and
nonlinear stages. Distinct patterns of behaviour are found: the transient
growth leading to nonlinearity at low rotation rates $Ro$, a highly chaotic
intermediate $Ro$ regime, a localised weak chaos at higher $Ro$, and complete
stabilization of transient disturbances at very high $Ro$. At very low $Ro$,
the transient growth amplitudes are close to those for non-rotating flow, but
Coriolis forces already assert themselves by producing distinct asymmetry about
the channel centreline. Nonlinear processes are then triggered, in a
streak-breakdown mode of transition. The high $Ro$ regimes do not show these
signatures, here the leading eigenmode emerges as dominant in the early stages.
Elongated structures plastered close to one wall are seen at higher rotation
rates. Rotation is shown to reduce non-normality in the linear operator, in an
indirect manifestation of Taylor--Proudman effects. Although the critical
Reynolds for exponential growth of instabilities is known to vary a lot with
rotation rate, we show that the energy critical Reynolds number is insensitive
to rotation rate. It is hoped that these findings will motivate experimental
verification, and examination of other rotating flows in this light.

exploring the effect of different model parameters in the determination of

calculated from the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium, mass and energy

adjusted to match Jupiter's observational constrains radius and gravitational
moments. We show that the determination of Jupiter interior structure is tied
to the estimation of its gravitational moments and the accuracy of equations of
state of hydrogen, helium and heavy elements. The location of the region where
Helium rain occurs as well as its timescale are important to determine the
distribution of heavy elements and helium in the interior of Jupiter. We show
that differences find when modeling Jupiter's interior with recent EOS are more
likely due to differences in the internal energy and entropy calculation. The
consequent changes in the thermal profile lead to different estimations of the

incorporated into synthetic calcium oxalate, and in a manner that depends on
their ionic radius when precipitated in solution. One such mechanism of
incorporation is based on the replacement of calcium ions by other metal
cations within the host unit cell. The unit cell of calcium oxalate expands

some frameworks can be constructed. Based on the assumption that the polynomial

it difficult to pass the gradient update from the discriminative model to the

galaxies and derive cosmological constraints from the redshift dependence of
the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect. The apparent anisotropy in the distribution
of observed galaxies arise from two main sources, the redshift-space distortion
(RSD) effect due to the galaxy peculiar velocities, and the geometric
distortion when incorrect cosmological models are assumed for transforming
redshift to comoving distance, known as the AP effect. Anisotropies produced by
the RSD effect are, although large, maintaining a nearly uniform magnitude over
a large range of redshift, while the degree of anisotropies from the AP effect
varies with redshift by much larger magnitude. We split the DR12 galaxies into
six redshift bins, measure the 2-point correlation function in each bin, and
assess the redshift evolution of anisotropies. We obtain constraints of
$\Omega_m=0.290 \pm 0.053,\ \ w = -1.07 \pm 0.15$, which are comparable with
the current constraints from other cosmological probes such as type Ia
supernovae, cosmic microwave background, and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO).
Combining these cosmological probes with our method yield tight constraints of
$ \Omega_m = 0.301 \pm 0.006,\ w=-1.054 \pm 0.025$. Our method is complementary
to the other large scale structure probes like BAO and topology. We expect this

not appear as a dissipative reservoir to the atoms. We adopt the image method
and show that the dynamics of the two atoms are completely equivalent to those
of a four-atom system. Moreover, two threshold coupling strengths exist, one
corresponding to the strength of coupling of the plasma field to the symmetric
and the other the antisymmetric mode of the two-atom system. The thresholds
distinguish between the non-Markovian (memory preserving) and Markovian
(memoryless) regimes of the evolutions that different time scales of the
evolution of the memory effects and entanglement can be observed. The Markovian
regime is characterized by exponentially decaying whereas the non-Markovian
regime by sinusoidally oscillating contributions to the evolution of the
probability amplitudes. The solutions predict a large and long living
entanglement mediated by the plasma field in both Markovian and non-Markovian
regimes of the evolution. We also show that a simultaneous Markovian and
non-Markovian regime of the evolution may occur in which the memory effects
exist over a finite evolution time. In the case of an off-resonant coupling of
the atoms to the plasma field, the atoms interact with each other by exchanging
virtual photons which results in the dynamics corresponding to those of two
atoms coupled to a common reservoir. In addition, the entanglement is
significantly enhanced under the off-resonant coupling.

Some of them are due to the special layout of these devices, which often use a
coplanar configuration with relatively large barrier channels and the
possibility of hosting Pearl vortices. A Josephson junction with a quasi ideal
two-dimensional barrier has been realized by growing graphene on SiC with Al
electrodes. Chemical Vapor Deposition offers centimeter size monolayer areas
where it is possible to realize a comparative analysis of different devices
with nominally the same barrier. In samples with a graphene gap below 400 nm,
we have found evidence of Josephson coherence in presence of an incipient
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. When the magnetic field is cycled,
a remarkable hysteretic collapse and revival of the Josephson supercurrent
occurs. Similar hysteresis are found in granular systems and are usually
justified within the Bean Critical State model (CSM). We show that the CSM,
with appropriate account for the low dimensional geometry, can partly explain
the odd features measured in these junctions.

The mapper employs genetic algorithm to find the best combination of requests

request via an induced sub-graph isomorphism stage. The proposed mapper is
tested on grid testbeds and randomly generated topologies. The solution of our
mapper is compared to the optimal one, obtained through a brute-force search,

scenarios. Furthermore, we show the effect of the careful design of testbed
topology on enhancing the testbed utilization by applying our mapper on a

Progress has been made over the past decade by fabricating materials with

groups and thermal properties of polymers remains to be established. Here, we
numerically study the thermal conductivity of single-stranded carbon-chain
polymers with multiple substituents of hydrogen atoms through atomic mass
modification. We find that their thermal conductivity can be tuned by atomic
mass modifications as revealed through molecular dynamics simulations. The
simulation results suggest that heavy homogeneous substituents do not assist
heat transport and trace amounts of heavy substituents can in fact hinder heat
transport substantially. Our analysis indicates that carbon chain has the
biggest contribution (over 80%) to the thermal conduction in single-stranded
carbon-chain polymers. We further demonstrate that atomic mass modifications
influence the phonon bands of bonding carbon atoms, and the discrepancies of
phonon bands between carbon atoms are responsible for the remarkable drops in
thermal conductivity and large thermal resistances in carbon chains. Our study
provides fundamental insight into how to tailor the thermal conductivity of
polymers through variable substituents.

these entities when designing their own networks. In this paper, we study the
game investigating how the rational behaviors of entities impact the system
robustness. We first introduce a mathematical model to quantify the interacting
payoffs among varying entities. Then we study the Nash equilibrium of the game
and compare it with the optimal social welfare. We reveal that the cooperation
among different entities can be reached to maximize the social welfare in
continuous game only when the average degree of each network is constant.
Therefore, the huge gap between Nash equilibrium and optimal social welfare
generally exists. The rationality of entities makes the system inherently
deficient and even renders it extremely vulnerable in some cases. We analyze
our model for two concrete systems with continuous strategy space and discrete
strategy space, respectively. Furthermore, we uncover some factors (such as
weakening coupled strength of interdependent networks, designing suitable
topology dependency of the system) that help reduce the gap and the system
