probabilities $p_c$, $p_T$ and the critical probability $\tilde{p_c}$ defined
by Duminil-Copin and Tassion (2015) to bounded degree unimodular random graphs.
We further examine Schramm's conjecture in the case of unimodular random
graphs: does $p_c(G_n)$ converge to $p_c(G)$ if $G_n\to G$ in the local weak
sense? Among our results are the following:
  1. $p_c=\tilde{p_c}$ holds for bounded degree unimodular graphs. However,
there are unimodular graphs with sub-exponential volume growth and $p_T < p_c$;
i.e., the classical sharpness of phase transition does not hold.
  2. We give conditions which imply $\lim p_c(G_n) = p_c(\lim G_n)$.
  3. There are sequences of unimodular graphs such that $G_n\to G$ but
$p_c(G)>\lim p_c(G_n)$ or $p_c(G)<\lim p_c(G_n)<1$.
  As a corollary to our positive results, we show that for any transitive graph
with sub-exponential volume growth there is a sequence $T_n$ of large girth
bi-Lipschitz invariant subgraphs such that $p_c(T_n)\to 1$. It remains open
whether this holds whenever the transitive graph has cost 1.

gravitationally bound clouds of mm-cm-sized pebbles. Such clouds can form for
example through the streaming instability in protoplanetary disks. We model the
collapse process with a statistical model to obtain the internal structure of
planetesimals with solid radii between 10 and 1,000 km. In the collapse,
pebbles collide and, depending on relative speed, collisions have different
outcomes. A mixture of particle sizes inside a planetesimal leads to better
packing capabilities and higher densities. In this paper we apply results from
new laboratory experiments of dust aggregate collisions (presented in a
companion paper) to model collision outcomes. We find that the internal
structure of a planetesimal is strongly dependent on both its mass and the
applied fragmentation model. Low-mass planetesimals have no/few fragmenting
pebble collisions in the collapse phase and end up as porous pebble-piles. The
amount of fragmenting collisions increases with increasing cloud mass,
resulting in wider particle size distributions and higher density. The collapse
is nevertheless ""cold"" in the sense that collision speeds are damped by the
high collision frequency. This ensures that a significant fraction of large
pebbles survive the collapse in all but the most massive clouds. Our results
are in broad agreement with the observed increase in density of Kuiper belt
objects with increasing size as exemplified by the recent characterization of
the highly porous comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

difficulty of performing optimal Bayesian MMSE (minimum mean squared error)
inference often necessitates the use of maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference, a
special case of regularized M-estimation, as a surrogate. However, MAP is
suboptimal in high dimensions, when the number of unknown signal components is
similar to the number of measurements. In this work we demonstrate, when the
signal distribution and the likelihood function associated with the noise are
both log-concave, that optimal MMSE performance is asymptotically achievable
via another M-estimation procedure. This procedure involves minimizing convex
loss and regularizer functions that are nonlinearly smoothed versions of the
widely applied MAP optimization problem. Our findings provide a new heuristic
derivation and interpretation for recent optimal M-estimators found in the
setting of linear measurements and additive noise, and further extend these
results to nonlinear measurements with non-additive noise. We numerically
demonstrate superior performance of our optimal M-estimators relative to MAP.
Overall, at the heart of our work is the revelation of a remarkable equivalence
between two seemingly very different computational problems: namely that of
high dimensional Bayesian integration underlying MMSE inference, and high
dimensional convex optimization underlying M-estimation. In essence we show
that the former difficult integral may be computed by solving the latter,
simpler optimization problem.

to the near-infrared. It allows to do a more detailed analysis of the
atmospheric composition in order to determine the stellar parameters, and to
constrain the atmospheric models. The study will allow us to further understand
physical and chemical processes such as increasing condensation of gas into
dust, to point out the missing continuum opacities and see how the main band
features are reproduced by the models. The spectral resolution and the large
wavelength coverage used is a unique combination to constrain the process that
occur in cool atmosphere. Methods. We obtained medium-resolution (R =
5000-7000) spectra over the wavelength range 0.3-2.5 {\mu}m of ten M-type
subdwarfs with X-SHOOTER at VLT. These data constitute an unique atlas of
M-subdwarfs from optical to near-infrared. We performed spectral synthesis
analysis using a full grid of synthetic spectra computed from BT-Settl models
and obtained consistent stellar parameters such as effective temperature,
surface gravity and metallicity. Results. We show that state-of the-art
atmospheric models correctly represent the overall shape of their spectral
energy distribution, as well as atomic and molecular line profiles both in the
optical and near-infrared. We found that the actual fitted gravities of almost
all our sample are consistent with old objects, except for LHS 73 where it is
found surprisingly low.

arise from a localised area of the brain. The onset patterns of focal seizure
activity have been studied intensively, and they have largely been
distinguished into two types - low amplitude fast oscillations (LAF), or high
amplitude spikes (HAS). Here we explore whether these two patterns arise from
fundamentally different mechanisms. Here, we use a previously established
computational model of neocortical tissue, and validate it as an adequate model
using clinical recordings of focal seizures. We then reproduce the two onset
patterns in their most defining properties and investigate the possible
mechanisms underlying the different focal seizure onset patterns in the model.
We show that the two patterns are associated with different mechanisms at the
spatial scale of a single ECoG electrode. The LAF onset is initiated by
independent patches of localised activity, which slowly invade the surrounding
tissue and coalesce over time. In contrast, the HAS onset is a global, systemic
transition to a coexisting seizure state triggered by a local event. We find
that such a global transition is enabled by an increase in the excitability of
the ""healthy"" surrounding tissue, which by itself does not generate seizures,
but can support seizure activity when incited. In our simulations, the
difference in surrounding tissue excitability also offers a simple explanation
of the clinically reported difference in surgical outcomes. Finally, we
demonstrate in the model how changes in tissue excitability could be
elucidated, in principle, using active stimulation. Taken together, our
modelling results suggest that the excitability of the tissue surrounding the
seizure core may play a determining role in the seizure onset pattern, as well
as in the surgical outcome.

dipoles connected through a soliton ring. We give the parameter ranges for

chemical accuracy is still prohibitively expensive for ab-initio MBE to compete
with force field approximations for applications beyond single-point energies.
Alongside the MBE, empirical models of ab-initio potential energy surfaces have
improved, especially non-linear models based on neural networks (NN) which can
reproduce ab-initio potential energy surfaces rapidly and accurately. Although
they are fast, NNs suffer from their own curse of dimensionality; they must be
trained on a representative sample of chemical space. In this paper we examine
the synergy of the MBE and NN's, and explore their complementarity. The MBE
offers a systematic way to treat systems of arbitrary size and intelligently
sample chemical space. NN's reduce, by a factor in excess of $10^6$ the
computational overhead of the MBE and reproduce the accuracy of ab-initio

that clustering of dust particles in a temperature stratified turbulent flow

radiation penetration length. These particle clusters, even far ahead of the
flame, are sufficiently exposed and heated by the radiation from the flame to
become ignition kernels capable to ignite a large volume of fuel-air mixtures.
This efficiently increases the total flame surface area and the effective
combustion speed, defined as the rate of reactant consumption of a given

overpressures required to account for the observed level of damage in
unconfined dust explosions, e.g., at the 2005 Buncefield vapor-cloud explosion.

origin of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe are three compelling questions
that cannot be accounted for in the Standard Model of particle physics. In this
thesis we focus on all these issues by providing a possible solution in terms
of a minimal extension of the Standard Model, consisting in the addition of a
set of sterile fermions to the field content of the theory. Sterile fermions
are gauge singlet fields, that can interact via mixing with the active
neutrinos. We focus on the Inverse Seesaw mechanism, which is characterised by
a low (TeV or lower) new physics scale and that can be tested in current and
future experimental facilities. We present the model building analysis that
points towards the minimal realisations of the mechanism, and the
phenomenological study in order to accommodate light neutrino masses and to
impose all the relevant experimental constraints in the model, as well as the
expected experimental signatures. We show the viability of the sterile neutrino
hypothesis as dark matter component, together with the characteristic features
of this scenario in the minimal Inverse Seesaw mechanism. The possibility of
successfully accounting for the baryon asymmetry in a testable realisation of
the leptogenesis mechanism is also addressed. On the other hand it is important
to look for manifestations of sterile fermions in laboratory experiments. We
address this point by making predictions for the expected rates of rare lepton
number violating decays of vector bosons, that can be mediated by sterile
fermions, as well as by studying the impact of sterile fermions on global fit
of electroweak precision data.

$(T:M_k\rightarrow M_m)$. We extend their concepts of support and total support
to these maps. We show that a positive map $T:M_k\rightarrow M_m$ is equivalent
to a doubly stochastic map if and only if $T:M_k\rightarrow M_m$ is equivalent
to a positive map with total support.
  Moreover, if $k$ and $m$ are coprime then $T:M_k\rightarrow M_m$ is
equivalent to a doubly stochastic map if and only if $T:M_k\rightarrow M_m$ has
support.
  This result provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the filter
normal form, which is commonly used in Quantum Information Theory in order to
simplify the task of detecting entanglement. Let $A=\sum_{i=1}^nA_i\otimes
B_i\in M_k\otimes M_m$ be a state and $G_A: M_k\rightarrow M_m$ be the positive
map $G_A(X)=\sum_{i=1}^nB_itr(A_iX)$. We show that $A$ can be put in the filter
normal form if and only if $G_A: M_k\rightarrow M_m$ is equivalent to a
positive map with total support. We prove that any state $A\in M_k\otimes
M_m\simeq M_{km}$ such that $\dim(\ker(A))<k-1$, if $k=m$, and
$\dim(\ker(A))<\min\{k,m\}$, if $k\neq m$, can be put in the filter normal
form.
  Recently, a connection between the capacity of a rectangular positive map
$T:M_k\rightarrow M_m$ and the capacity of a certain square positive map
$\widetilde{T}:M_{mk}\rightarrow M_{mk}$ was noticed. Here, we obtain a deeper
connection between these maps. As a corollary of our main results, we prove
that $T:M_k\rightarrow M_m$ is equivalent to a doubly stochastic map if and
only if $\widetilde{T}:M_{mk}\rightarrow M_{mk}$ is equivalent to a doubly

Using deep reinforcement learning to train general purpose neural network
policies alleviates some of the burden of manual representation engineering by
using expressive policy classes, but exacerbates the challenge of data
collection, since such methods tend to be less efficient than RL with
low-dimensional, hand-designed representations. Transfer learning can mitigate
this problem by enabling us to transfer information from one skill to another
and even from one robot to another. We show that neural network policies can be
decomposed into ""task-specific"" and ""robot-specific"" modules, where the
task-specific modules are shared across robots, and the robot-specific modules
are shared across all tasks on that robot. This allows for sharing task
information, such as perception, between robots and sharing robot information,
such as dynamics and kinematics, between tasks. We exploit this decomposition
to train mix-and-match modules that can solve new robot-task combinations that
were not seen during training. Using a novel neural network architecture, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our transfer method for enabling zero-shot
generalization with a variety of robots and tasks in simulation for both visual

addition, we demonstrate that this dangerous $^{210}$Po surface background can
be suppressed by a factor of ~100 or higher using pulse shape discrimination
methods, which can make argon dark matter detectors near background-free and
enhance their potential for discovery of medium- and high-mass WIMPs. We also
discuss the impact on other low background experiments.

of independence for Galois (orbital) types over models, we derive that the

can be achieved in a simple manner, where an appropriate weighted average is
computed between two definitions of the action density $\langle E(t)\rangle$
measured at every flow time $t$. We further develop the idea of achieving the
tree-level $\mathcal{O}(a^4)$ improvement. For testing our proposal, we present
numerical results for $\langle E(t) \rangle$ obtained on gauge configurations
generated with the Wilson and Iwasaki gauge actions at three lattice spacings
($a\approx 0.1, 0.07,$ and 0.05 fm). Our results show that tree-level improved
flows significantly eliminate the discretization corrections on $t^2\langle
E(t)\rangle$ in the relatively small-$t$ regime. To demonstrate the feasibility
of our tree-level improvement proposal, we also study the scaling behavior of
the dimensionless combinations of the $\Lambda_{\overline{\textrm{MS}}}$
parameter and the new reference scale $t_X$, which is defined through
$t_X^2\langle E(t_X)\rangle=X$ for the smaller $X$, e.g., $X= 0.15$. It is
found that $\sqrt{t_{0.15}}\Lambda_{\overline{\textrm{MS}}}$ shows a nearly
perfect scaling behavior as a function of $a^2$ regardless of the types of
gauge action and flow, after tree-level improvement is achieved up to
$\mathcal{O}(a^4)$. Further detailed study of the scaling behavior exposes the
presence of the remnant $\mathcal{O}(g^{2n} a^2)$ corrections, which are beyond
the tree level. Although our proposal is not enough to eliminate all
$\mathcal{O}(a^2)$ effects, we show that the $\mathcal{O}(g^{2n} a^2)$

$\mathcal{O}(a^2)$ improved flow.

This can be mathematically described as a Win-Stay-Lose-Shift strategy with
dynamic aspiration levels, where individuals aspire to be as wealthy as their
average neighbor. Here we investigate this model in the realm of evolutionary
social dilemmas on the square lattice and scale-free networks. By using the
master equation and Monte Carlo simulations, we find that cooperators coexist
with defectors in the whole phase diagram, even at high temptations to defect.
We study the microscopic mechanism that is responsible for the striking
persistence of cooperative behavior and find that cooperation spreads through
second-order neighbors, rather than by means of network reciprocity that
dominates in imitation-based models. For the square lattice the master equation
can be solved analytically in the large temperature limit of the Fermi
function, while for other cases the resulting differential equations must be
solved numerically. Either way, we find good qualitative agreement with the
Monte Carlo simulation results. Our analysis also reveals that the evolutionary
outcomes are to a large degree independent of the network topology, including
the number of neighbors that are considered for payoff determination on
lattices, which further corroborates the local character of the microscopic
dynamics. Unlike large-scale spatial patterns that typically emerge due to
network reciprocity, here local checkerboard-like patterns remain virtually
unaffected by differences in the macroscopic properties of the interaction
network.

For a flat redshift distribution similar to the one of the CosmicFlows-3
survey, the deviations are even more prominent in both the shape and amplitude
at all separations considered $({\stackrel{<}{{}_\sim}} 100h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc})$.
Conclusions based on statistics calculated without taking into account the

computationally prohibitive. The here proposed MPC strategy in conjunction with
a Benders decomposition technique effectively reduces the computational
complexity to a manageable level. We use the CIGRE low voltage (LV) benchmark

different control strategies with different MPC prediction horizons. The
objective of the MPC strategy is to maximize the photovoltaic (PV) utilization

all grid constraints. For this case study we show that the economic value of
battery storage is higher when using MPC based storage control strategies than
when using heuristic storage control strategies, because MPC strategies
explicitly exploit the value of forecast information. The economic merit of
this approach can be further increased by explicitly incorporating a battery

varies between epochs, with a slow but persistent spin up over the 2013-2016

bluer variation at shorter timescales, supports the thermal fluctuation origin
of the UV/optical variation in quasars, and can be well modeled with the
inhomogeneous accretion disk model. In this paper, we extend the study to much
shorter wavelengths in the rest frame (down to extreme UV), using GALaxy
Evolution eXplorer (GALEX) photometric data of quasars collected in two
ultraviolet bands (near-UV and far-UV). We develop Monte-Carlo simulations to
correct possible biases due to the considerably larger photometric
uncertainties in GALEX light curves (particularly in far-UV, comparing with

securely confirm the previously discovered timescale dependence of the color
variability with independent datasets and at shorter wavelengths. We further
find the slope of the correlation between the amplitude of color variation and
timescale however appears even steeper than that predicted by the inhomogeneous
disk model, which assumes that disk fluctuations follow damped random walk

comparing with that at longer wavelengths, this implies deviation from DRW

collider experiments and possible observation of gravitational waves emitted
during the phase transition. We also discuss the possibility of a non-standard
cosmological history which can facilitate EWBG. We show how acceptable
parameter space can be extended due to such a modification and conclude that
next generation precision experiments such as the ILC will be able to confirm
or falsify many models realizing EWBG. We also show that, in general, collider

observation of a deviation from the SM without any hints of gravitational waves
can point to models with modified cosmological history that generically enable
EWBG with weaker phase transition and thus, smaller GW signals.

surrounding $\gamma^2$ Velorum. The age of 7.5+/-1 Myr inferred from the CMD is
much younger than that implied by the strong Li depletion seen in the cluster
M-dwarfs and the Li depletion occurs at much redder colours than predicted. The
epoch at which a star of a given mass depletes its Li and the surface
temperature of that star are both dependent on its radius. We demonstrate that
if the low-mass stars have radii ~10 per cent larger at a given mass and age,
then both the CMD and Li depletion pattern of the Gamma Vel cluster are
explained at a common age of 18-21 Myr. This radius inflation could be produced
by some combination of magnetic suppression of convection and extensive cool
starspots. Models that incorporate radius inflation suggest that PMS stars
similar to those in the Gamma Vel cluster, in the range 0.2<M/Msun<0.7, are at
least a factor of two older and ~7 per cent cooler than previously thought and
that their masses are much larger (by >30 per cent) than inferred from
conventional, non-magnetic models in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.
Systematic changes of this size may be of great importance in understanding the
evolution of young stars, disc lifetimes and the formation of planetary

crust out of thermal equilibrium with the core. After the outburst the crust
thermally relaxes toward equilibrium with the neutron star core and the surface
thermal emission powers the quiescent X-ray light curve. Crust cooling models
predict that thermal equilibrium of the crust will be established $\approx 1000
\, \mathrm{d}$ into quiescence. Recent observations of the cooling neutron star
transient MXB 1659-29, however, suggest that the crust did not reach thermal
equilibrium with the core on the predicted timescale and continued to cool
after $\approx 2500 \, \mathrm{d}$ into quiescence. Because the quiescent light
curve reveals successively deeper layers of the crust, the observed late time
cooling of MXB 1659-29 depends on the thermal transport in the inner crust. In
particular, the observed late time cooling is consistent with a low thermal
conductivity layer near the depth predicted for nuclear pasta that maintains a
temperature gradient between the neutron star's inner crust and core for
thousands of days into quiescence. As a result, the temperature near the
crust-core boundary remains above the critical temperature for neutron
superfluidity and a layer of normal neutrons forms in the inner crust. We find
that the late time cooling of MXB 1659-29 is consistent with heat release from

left-censored regression. Type-I censored regression models are extremely
common in practice, where a competing event makes the variable of interest
unobservable. However, techniques developed for entirely observed data do not
directly apply to the censored observations. In this paper, we develop smoothed
estimating equations that augment the de-biasing method, such that the
resulting estimator is adaptive to censoring and is more robust to the
misspecification of the error distribution. We propose a unified class of
robust estimators, including Mallow's, Schweppe's and Hill-Ryan's one-step
estimator.
  In the ultra-high-dimensional setting, where the dimensionality can grow
exponentially with the sample size, we show that as long as the preliminary
estimator converges faster than $n^{-1/4}$, the one-step estimator inherits
asymptotic distribution of fully iterated version. Moreover, we show that the
size of the residuals of the Bahadur representation matches those of the simple
linear models, $s^{3/4 } (\log (p \vee n))^{3/4} / n^{1/4}$ -- that is, the
effects of censoring asymptotically disappear. Simulation studies demonstrate
that our method is adaptive to the censoring level and asymmetry in the error
distribution, and does not lose efficiency when the errors are from symmetric
distributions. Finally, we apply the developed method to a real data set from
the MAQC-II repository that is related to the HIV-1 study.

degradations such as blur, Gaussian noise, and compression artifacts.
Preliminary results using the CSIQ benchmark image quality dataset showed that

Euclidean distance between the barycenter or SAPV profiles of two entities as

explained either by dissipation in a bow wave as the white dwarf's magnetic

Confined within a small volume, negative pressure can build up until cavities
form spontaneously. The critical negative pressure for cavitation in water has
been theoretically predicted to be in the range of -100 to -200 MPa at room
temperature, whereas values around -30 MPa have been obtained by many
experiments. The discrepancy has yet to be resolved. In this study we perform
molecular dynamics simulations to study cavitation of water under volume
controlled stretching. It is found that liquid water exhibits a nonlinear
elastic compressibility (or stretchability) under hydrostatic tension and
remains stable within the confined volume until spontaneous cavitation occurs
at a critical strain. Subsequently, as the volume-controlled stretching
continues, the cavity grows stably and the hydrostatic tension decreases
continuously until the box volume is large enough for another transition to
form a water droplet. A modified nucleation theory is proposed to predict the
critical condition for cavitation. In particular, a strong dependence of the
critical strain and stress for cavitation on the initial liquid volume is
predicted by the modified nucleation theory, which may offer a possible
explanation for the discrepancies in the values of the critical negative
pressure obtained from experiments.

k_e \sigma_*^2 R_e / G$, with $M$ being the mass, $\sigma_*$ being the stellar
velocity dispersion, $R_e$ being the effective radius, $G$ being Newton's
constant, and $k_e$ being the virial factor, a geometry factor of order unity.
Applying this relation to (a) the ATLAS3D sample of Cappellari et al. (2013)
and (b) the sample of Saglia et al. (2016) gives ensemble-averaged factors
$\langle k_e\rangle =5.15\pm0.09$ and $\langle k_e\rangle =4.01\pm0.18$,
respectively, with the difference arising from different definitions of
effective velocity dispersions. The two datasets reveal a statistically
significant tilt of the empirical relation relative to the theoretical virial
relation such that $M\propto(\sigma_*^2R_e)^{0.92}$. This tilt disappears when
replacing $R_e$ with the semi-major axis of the projected half-light ellipse,
$a$. All best-fit scaling relations show zero intrinsic scatter, implying that
the mass plane of ETGs is fully determined by the virial relation. Whenever a
comparison is possible, my results are consistent with, and confirm, the
results by Cappellari et al. (2013). The difference between the relations using
either $a$ or $R_e$ arises from a known lack of highly elliptical high-mass
galaxies; this leads to a scaling $(1-\epsilon) \propto M^{0.12}$, with
$\epsilon$ being the ellipticity and $R_e = a\sqrt{1-\epsilon}$. Accordingly,
$a$, not $R_e$, is the correct proxy for the scale radius of ETGs. By geometry,
this implies that early-type galaxies are axisymmetric and oblate in general,
in agreement with published results from modeling based on kinematics and light
distributions.

from the coupling to mobile charges in itinerant magnets. Performing a
large-scale numerical simulation in a minimal model for itinerant magnets,
i.e., the Kondo lattice model with classical localized spins, we show that the
shape of magnetic domain walls depends on the electronic band structure and
electron filling. While Neel and 120 antiferromagnetic states do not show a
strong preference in the shape of domain walls, noncoplanar spin states with
scalar chiral ordering have distinct directional preferences of the domain
walls depending on the electron filling. We find that the directional
preference is rationalized by the wave-number dependence of the effective
magnetic interactions induced by the mobile charges, which are set by the band
structure and electron filling. We also observe that, in the noncoplanar chiral
states, an electric current is induced along the domain walls owing to the spin
Berry phase mechanism, with very different spatial distributions depending on
whether the bulk state is metallic or insulating.

functions for polynomial systems. However, for general large-scale nonlinear
networks it is yet very difficult, and often impossible, both computationally

decomposition coupled to a vector Lyapunov functions approach provides a
feasible alternative by analyzing the stability of the nonlinear network
through a reduced-order comparison system. However, finding such a comparison
system is not trivial and often, for a nonlinear network, there does not exist
a single comparison system. In this work, we propose a multiple comparison
systems approach for the algorithmic stability analysis of nonlinear systems.

show that scattering increases the electron transmission in the nominally

degradation models, a special random field is constructed for modeling the
spatio-temporal degradation process. In particular, we express the degradation
at any spatial location and time as an additive superposition of two stochastic
components: a dynamic spatial degradation generation process, and a
spatio-temporal degradation propagation process. Some unique challenges are
addressed, including the spatial heterogeneity of the degradation process, the
spatial propagation of degradation to neighboring areas, the anisotropic and
space-time non-separable covariance structure often associated with a complex
spatio-temporal degradation process, and the computational issue related to
parameter estimation. When the spatial dependence is ignored, we show that the
proposed spatio-temporal degradation model incorporates some existing pure
time-dependent degradation processes as its special cases. We also show the
connection, under special conditions, between the proposed model and general
physical degradation processes which are often defined by stochastic partial
differential equations. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the

the finite car system for any routing policy, both static and dynamic, under

many efficient applications in various areas; and it has been shown that the
convergence is not guaranteed when it is directly extended to the
multiple-block case of separable convex minimization problems where there are
$m\ge 3$ functions without coupled variables in the objective. This fact has
given great impetus to investigate various conditions on both the model and the
algorithm's parameter that can ensure the convergence of the direct extension
of ADMM (abbreviated as ""e-ADMM""). Despite some results under very strong
conditions (e.g., at least $(m-1)$ functions should be strongly convex) that
are applicable to the generic case with a general $m$, some others concentrate
on the special case of $m=3$ under the relatively milder condition that only
one function is assumed to be strongly convex. We focus on extending the
convergence analysis from the case of $m=3$ to the more general case of
$m\ge3$. That is, we show the convergence of e-ADMM for the case of $m\ge 3$
with the assumption of only $(m-2)$ functions being strongly convex; and
establish its convergence rates in different scenarios such as the worst-case
convergence rates measured by iteration complexity and the asymptotically
linear convergence rate under stronger assumptions. Thus the convergence of
e-ADMM for the general case of $m\ge 4$ is proved; this result seems to be
still unknown even though it is intuitive given the known result of the case of
$m=3$. Even for the special case of $m=3$, our convergence results turn out to
be more general than the exiting results that are derived specifically for the

We find that Co has positive effect on the stability of the ThMn12 structure.
In contrast with Ti substitution, Co substitution does not reduce the

nearly unchanged by Co substitution, and nitrogenation to NdFe11Co greatly

  Based on kNN Graph",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is a fundamental problem in many
areas of data mining, machine learning and computer vision. The performance of
traditional hierarchical structure (tree) based methods decreases as the
dimensionality of data grows, while hashing based methods usually lack
efficiency in practice. Recently, the graph based methods have drawn
considerable attention. The main idea is that \emph{a neighbor of a neighbor is
also likely to be a neighbor}, which we refer as \emph{NN-expansion}. These
methods construct a $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$NN) graph offline. And at online
search stage, these methods find candidate neighbors of a query point in some
way (\eg, random selection), and then check the neighbors of these candidate
neighbors for closer ones iteratively. Despite some promising results, there
are mainly two problems with these approaches: 1) These approaches tend to
converge to local optima. 2) Constructing a $k$NN graph is time consuming. We
find that these two problems can be nicely solved when we provide a good
initialization for NN-expansion. In this paper, we propose EFANNA, an extremely
fast approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm based on $k$NN Graph. Efanna
nicely combines the advantages of hierarchical structure based methods and
nearest-neighbor-graph based methods. Extensive experiments have shown that
EFANNA outperforms the state-of-art algorithms both on approximate nearest
neighbor search and approximate nearest neighbor graph construction. To the
best of our knowledge, EFANNA is the fastest algorithm so far both on
approximate nearest neighbor graph construction and approximate nearest
neighbor search. A library EFANNA based on this research is released on Github.

system performance since the processor speed largely outperforms the DRAM
latency. In this thesis, we develop a low-cost mechanism, called ChargeCache,
which enables faster access to recently-accessed rows in DRAM, with no
modifications to DRAM chips. Our mechanism is based on the key observation that
a recently-accessed row has more charge and thus the following access to the
same row can be performed faster. To exploit this observation, we propose to
track the addresses of recently-accessed rows in a table in the memory
controller. If a later DRAM request hits in that table, the memory controller
uses lower timing parameters, leading to reduced DRAM latency. Row addresses
are removed from the table after a specified duration to ensure rows that have
leaked too much charge are not accessed with lower latency. We evaluate
ChargeCache on a wide variety of workloads and show that it provides
significant performance and energy benefits for both single-core and multi-core

simulations. We build merger trees to connect galaxies to their progenitors at
different redshifts and characterize their assembly histories by focusing on
the time when half of the galaxy stellar mass was assembled into the main
progenitor. We show that galaxies with stellar mass $M_*<10^{10.5}M_{\odot}$
assemble most of their stellar mass through star formation in the main
progenitor (`in-situ' star formation). This can be understood as a consequence
of the steep rise in star formation efficiency with halo mass for these
galaxies. For more massive galaxies, however, an increasing fraction of their
stellar mass is formed outside the main progenitor and subsequently accreted.
Consequently, while for low-mass galaxies the assembly time is close to the
stellar formation time, the stars in high-mass galaxies typically formed long
before half of the present-day stellar mass was assembled into a single object,
giving rise to the observed anti-hierarchical downsizing trend. In a typical
present-day $M_*\geq10^{11}M_{\odot}$ galaxy, around $20\%$ of the stellar mass
has an external origin. This fraction decreases with increasing redshift.
Bearing in mind that mergers only make an important contribution to the stellar
mass growth of massive galaxies, we find that the dominant contribution comes
from mergers with galaxies of mass greater than one tenth of the main
progenitor's mass. The galaxy merger fraction derived from our simulations
agrees with recent observational estimates.

(UDSBM). We demonstrate how the mean squared displacement (MSD) and the time
averaged MSD of UDSBM are affected by the inertial term in the Langevin
equation, both at short, intermediate, and even long diffusion times. In
particular, we quantify the ballistic regime for the MSD and the time averaged
MSD as well as the spread of individual time averaged MSD trajectories. One of
the main effects we observe is that---both for the MSD and the time averaged
MSD---for superdiffusive UDSBM the ballistic regime is much shorter than for
ordinary Brownian motion. In contrast, for subdiffusive UDSBM the ballistic
region extends to much longer diffusion times. Therefore, particular care needs
to be taken when the overdamped limit indeed provides a correct description,
even in the long time limit. We also analyze to what extent ergodicity in the
Boltzmann-Khinchin sense in this non-stationary system is broken, both for
subdiffusive and superdiffusive UDSBM. Finally, the limiting case of ultraslow
UDSBM is considered, with a mixed logarithmic and power law dependence of the
ensemble and time averaged MSDs of the particles. In the limit of strong
ageing, remarkably, the ordinary UDSBM and the ultraslow UDSBM behave similarly
in the short time ballistic limit. The approaches developed here open new ways
for considering other stochastic processes under physically important
conditions when a finite particle mass and ageing in the system cannot be

of carbon onions inside the C1+ implanted metal surfaces at high temperatures

wrapped around C60. We report spheroidal cage formation of shell with variable
shell thickness, radii and curvature on C1+-irradiated Cu surfaces by the
accumulating C atoms which emerge out of the edges of the implanted sheets and
grids. Atom-by-atom C accreting structures grow along the edges, corners and
crevices. These, in turn, form the open and closed multiple-shelled cages.
Variable curvature is the most common feature of the growing structures. The
growth at room temperature does not ensure sphericity of the cages due to the
absence of high temperature annealing. These cages have very low density,
hollow interiors and often exhibit the conspicuous cage-inside-cage structures.
Another feature of the as-grown, non-spherical onions is the existence of
spherical protrusions with different local radii within the same cage.
Formation of cages with sizes ~ few nanometer to hundreds of nanometer depends
upon the irradiation rate of C1+. In situ formation and transformations of the
cages observed under 120 keV electron beam irradiation is described by using a
nanoelastic model.

after perihelion. In the mean time, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and OCS abundances relative
to water increased by a factor of 2 to reach mean values of 32%, 0.47%, and
0.18%, respectively, averaging post-perihelion data. We interpret these changes
as resulting from the erosion of volatile-poor surface layers. Sustained dust
ablation due to the sublimation of water ice maintained volatile-rich layers
near the surface until at least the end of the considered period, as expected
for low thermal inertia surface layers. The large abundance measured for CO$_2$

that 67P is a CO$_2$-rich comet. Comparison with abundance ratios measured in

telescope size will be somewhat smaller than that of Planck, CORE will have a
considerably better angular resolution at its highest frequencies, since, in
contrast with Planck, it will be diffraction limited at all frequencies. The
improved resolution implies a considerable decrease of the source confusion,
i.e. substantially fainter detection limits. In particular, CORE will detect
thousands of strongly lensed high-z galaxies distributed over the full sky. The
extreme brightness of these galaxies will make it possible to study them, via
follow-up observations, in extraordinary detail. Also, the CORE resolution
matches the typical sizes of high-z galaxy proto-clusters much better than the
Planck resolution, resulting in a much higher detection efficiency; these
objects will be caught in an evolutionary phase beyond the reach of surveys in
other wavebands. Furthermore, CORE will provide unique information on the
evolution of the star formation in virialized groups and clusters of galaxies
up to the highest possible redshifts. Finally, thanks to its very high
sensitivity, CORE will detect the polarized emission of thousands of radio

infinitesimal spin waves are compared with the peaks of the Fourier transform
of the thermal expectation value of the autocorrelation function calculated by

Tension Lines (STLs) have been used by surgeons to decide the location and
orientation of an incision. Although these lines are patient-specific, most
surgeons rely on generic maps to determine their orientation. Beyond the
imprecise pinch test, there remains no accepted method for determining STLs in
vivo.
  Methods: (i) The speed of an elastic motion travelling radially on the skin
of canine cadavers was measured with a commercial device called the
Reviscometer. (ii) Similar to the original experiments conducted by Karl
Langer, circular excisions were made on the skin and the geometric changes to
the resulting wounds and excised samples were used to determine the orientation
of STLs.
  Results: A marked anisotropy in the speed of the elastic wave travelling
radially was observed. The orientation of the fastest wave was found to
correlate with the orientation of the elongated wound (P<0.001, R^2 = 74%).
Similarly, the orientation of fastest wave was the same for both in vivo and
excised isolated samples, indicating that the STLs have a structural basis.
Resulting wounds expanded by an average area of 9% (+16% along STL and -10%
across) while excised skin shrunk by an average area of 33% (23% along STL and
10% across).
  Conclusion: Elastic surface wave propagation has been validated
experimentally as a robust method for determining the orientation of STLs
non-destructively and non-invasively. This study has implications for the
identification of STLs and for the prediction of skin tension levels, both
important factors in both human and veterinary reconstructive surgery.

Cepheids have been intensively observed by infrared beam combiners, only a few
have been observed in the visible. This paper is part of a project to observe
Cepheids in the visible with interferometry as a counterpart to infrared
observations already in hand. Observations of delta Cep itself were secured
with the VEGA/CHARA instrument over the full pulsation cycle of the star. These
visible interferometric data are consistent in first approximation with a
quasi-hydrostatic model of pulsation surrounded by a static circumstellar
environment (CSE) with a size of theta_cse=8.9 +/- 3.0 mas and a relative flux
contribution of f_cse=0.07+/-0.01. A model of visible nebula (a background
source filling the field of view of the interferometer) with the same relative
flux contribution is also consistent with our data at small spatial
frequencies. However, in both cases, we find discrepancies in the squared
visibilities at high spatial frequencies (maximum 2sigma) with two different
regimes over the pulsation cycle of the star, phi=0.0-0.8 and phi=0.8-1.0. We
provide several hypotheses to explain these discrepancies, but more
observations and theoretical investigations are necessary before a firm
conclusion can be drawn. For the first time we have been able to detect in the
visible domain a resolved structure around delta~Cep. We have also shown that a
simple model cannot explain the observations, and more work will be necessary
in the future, both on observations and modelling.

the critical behaviors of ordinary percolation that are well understood, those
of hybrid percolation transitions have not been thoroughly understood yet.
Here, we investigate the critical behavior of $k$-core percolation of
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks. We find numerically that the fluctuations of the
order parameter and the mean avalanche size diverge in different ways. Thus, we
classify the critical exponents into two types: those associated with the order
parameter and those with finite avalanches. The conventional scaling relations
hold within each set, however, these two critical exponents are coupled.
Finally we discuss some universal features of the critical behaviors of

also by its distribution. Furthermore, in the area of the continuous

arbitrary distributions of vortices. The real-space Green's function approach
based on Chebyshev polynomials is complemented by a gauge transformation which
allows one to treat finite as well as infinite, ordered as well as disordered
vortex configurations. This tool gives unprecedented access to vortex lattices
at very low magnetic fields and glassy phases. After describing in detail the
method and its implementation, we use it to address a series of problems
related to $d$-wave superconductivity on the square lattice. We first study the
continuity of the vortex-core energy spectrum and its evolution from the
quantum regime to the semiclassical limit; we investigate the effect of the
band structure on the vortex by following the self-consistent solution through
a Lifshitz transition; we then study the evolution from the vortex lattice to
the isolated-vortex limit with decreasing field and show that a new emerging
length scale controls this transition; finally, we perform a statistical study
of the vortex-core local density of states in the presence of positional
disorder in the vortex lattice. The calculations reveal a number of qualitative
differences between the properties of vortices in the quantum and semiclassical
regimes.

method to select BCG progenitors at $z\sim 2$ is a hybrid environmental density
and stellar mass ranking approach. Ultimately we are able to retrieve 45\% of
BCG progenitors. We apply this method on the CANDELS UDS data to construct a
progenitor sample at high redshift. We furthermore populate the comparisons in
local universe by using SDSS data with statistically likely contamination to
ensure a fair comparison between high and low redshifts. Using these samples we
demonstrate that the BCG sizes have grown by a factor of $\sim 3.2$ since
$z\sim 2$, and BCG progenitors are mainly late-type galaxies, exhibiting less
concentrated profiles than their early-type local counterparts. We find that
BCG progenitors have more disturbed morphologies. In contrast, local BCGs have
much smoother profiles. Moreover, we find that the stellar masses of BCGs have
grown by a factor of $\sim 2.5$ since $z\sim 2$, and the SFR of BCG progenitors
has a median value of 13.5 $M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$, much higher than their quiescent
local descendants. We demonstrate that over $z=1-2$ star formation and merging
contribute equally to BCG mass growth. However, merging plays a dominant role
in BCG assembly at $z \lesssim 1$. We also find that BCG progenitors at
high-$z$ are not significantly different from other galaxies of similar mass at
the same epoch. This suggests that the processes which differentiate BCGs from
normal massive elliptical galaxies must occur at $z \lesssim 2$.

formation of geometrically flattened, rotating accretion flow surrounding the
new born star or star cluster. Gravitational instability may occur in such
accretion flow when the gas to stellar mass ratio is high (e.g. over
$\sim$10\%). This paper takes the OB cluster-forming region G10.6-0.4 as an
example. We introduce the enclosed gas mass around its central ultra compact
(UC) H\textsc{ii} region, addresses the gravitational stability of the
accreting gas, and outline the observed potential signatures of gravitational
instability. The position-velocity (PV) diagrams of various molecular gas
tracers on G10.6-0.4 consistently show asymmetry in the spatial and the
velocity domain. We deduce the morphology of the dense gas accretion flow by
modeling velocity distribution of the azimuthally asymmetric gas structures,
and by directly de-projecting the PV diagrams. We found that within the 0.3 pc
radius, an infall velocity of 1-2 km\,s$^{-1}$ may be required to explain the
observed PV diagrams. In addition, the velocity distribution traced in the PV
diagrams can be interpreted by spiral arm-like structures, which may be
connected with exterior infalling gas filaments. The morphology of dense gas
structures we propose appears very similar to the spatially resolved gas
structures around the OB cluster-forming region G33.92+0.11 with similar gas
mass and size, which however is likely to be approximately in a face-on
projection. The dense gas accretion flow around G10.6-0.4 appears to be Toomre
unstable, which is consistent with the existence of large-scale spiral arm-like
structures, and the formation of localize gas condensations.

cascade (FuSt) detection framework. In a coarse-to-fine flavor, our FuSt
consists of, from top to bottom, 1) multiple view-specific fast LAB cascade for
extremely quick face proposal, 2) multiple coarse MLP cascade for further
candidate window verification, and 3) a unified fine MLP cascade with
shape-indexed features for accurate face detection. Compared with other
structures, on the one hand, the proposed one uses multiple computationally
efficient distributed classifiers to propose a small number of candidate
windows but with a high recall of multi-view faces. On the other hand, by using
a unified MLP cascade to examine proposals of all views in a centralized style,
it provides a favorable solution for multi-view face detection with high
accuracy and low time-cost. Besides, the FuSt detector is alignment-aware and
performs a coarse facial part prediction which is beneficial for subsequent
face alignment. Extensive experiments on two challenging datasets, FDDB and
AFW, demonstrate the effectiveness of our FuSt detector in both accuracy and
speed.

outside-in arrangement of cameras placed around a scene, with viewpoints
converging on the center. They often create discomfort by possibly needed
marker suits, and their recording volume is severely restricted and often
constrained to indoor scenes with controlled backgrounds. Alternative
suit-based systems use several inertial measurement units or an exoskeleton to
capture motion. This makes capturing independent of a confined volume, but
requires substantial, often constraining, and hard to set up body
instrumentation. We therefore propose a new method for real-time, marker-less
and egocentric motion capture which estimates the full-body skeleton pose from
a lightweight stereo pair of fisheye cameras that are attached to a helmet or
virtual reality headset. It combines the strength of a new generative pose
estimation framework for fisheye views with a ConvNet-based body-part detector
trained on a large new dataset. Our inside-in method captures full-body motion
in general indoor and outdoor scenes, and also crowded scenes with many people
in close vicinity. The captured user can freely move around, which enables
reconstruction of larger-scale activities and is particularly useful in virtual
reality to freely roam and interact, while seeing the fully motion-captured
virtual body.

there is not much ongoing preprocessing occurring in the infall region at z=0.
By examining the baryonic content contained within the haloes, we also show
that the code-to-code scatter in stellar fraction across all halo masses is
typically ~2 orders of magnitude between the two most extreme cases, and this
is predominantly due to the differences in subgrid schemes and calibration

Poincar{\'e} maps in which the excitation by the plate at successive bounces is
assumed to be a discrete Markovian (memoryless) process. Here, we investigate
numerically the behaviour of the model for continuous random excitations with
tunable correlation time. We show that the system dynamics are controlled by
the ratio of the Markovian mean flight time of the ball and the mean time
between successive peaks in the motion of the exciting plate. When this ratio,
which depends on the bandwidth of the excitation signal, exceeds a certain
value, the Markovian approach is appropriate; below, memory of preceding
excitations arises, leading to a significant decrease of the jump duration; at
the smallest values of the ratio, chattering occurs. Overall, our results open
the way for uses of the model in the low excitation regime, which is still
poorly understood.

stacks of complex, doubly-correlated tremor records of multiple triplets of
seismographs back projected to hypothetical source locations in a geographic
grid. Peaks in the resulting stack of moduli are inferred source locations. The
stack of the moduli is a robust measure of energy radiated from a point source
or point sources even when the velocity information is imprecise. Application
to real data shows how double correlation focuses the source mapping compared
to the common single correlation approach. Synthetic tests demonstrate the
robustness of the method and its resolution limitations which are controlled by
the station geometry, the finite frequency of the signal, the quality of the
used velocity information and noise level. Both random noise and signal or
noise correlated at time shifts that are inconsistent with the assumed velocity
structure can be effectively suppressed. Assuming a surface-wave velocity, we
can constrain the source location even if the surface-wave component does not
dominate. The method can also in principle be used with body waves in three
dimensions, although this requires more data and seismographs placed near the
source for depth resolution.

properties on different capping materials has not been systematically

where the capping HM materials are W, Ta, and Pd. We found that the Co/HM
interface plays an important role on the magnetic properties. In particular,
the magnetic multilayers with a W capping layer features the lowest effective
damping value, which may be attributed to the different spin-orbit coupling and

ask whether some representations remain discrete after deformation. The answer
is generically not. A simple reason for it lies inside the cusps: the
degeneracy of the peripheral representation (i.e. representations of
fundamental groups of the $ \nu $ peripheral tori). They indeed generically
become non-discrete, except for a countable set. This last set corresponds to
hyperbolic Dehn surgeries on $ M$, for which the peripheral representation is
no more faithful.We work here in the framework of $ \mathrm {PGL}(n,\mathbf

unlike the $ \mathrm {PGL}(2)$-case, the generic behaviour becomes the
discreteness (and faithfulness) of the peripheral representation: in a

of social dynamics, with self-organization, i.e., the autonomous pattern
formation, as the main driving concept. Usually, first or second order models
are employed to reproduce, at least qualitatively, certain global patterns
(such as bird flocking, milling schools of fish or queue formations in
pedestrian flows, just to mention a few). It is, however, common experience
that self-organization does not always spontaneously occur in a society. In
this review chapter we aim to describe the limitations of decentralized
controls in restoring certain desired configurations and to address the
question of whether it is possible to externally and parsimoniously influence
the dynamics to reach a given outcome. More specifically, we address the issue
of finding the sparsest control strategy for finite agent-based models in order
to lead the dynamics optimally towards a desired pattern.

feasibility and technological developments -- for technologies not yet
sufficiently mature. These ideas may in the future become candidates for M or L
class missions within the ESA Science Program.
  With the launch of Gaia in December 2013, Europe entered a new era of space
astrometry following in the footsteps of the very successful Hipparcos mission
from the early 1990s. Gaia is the successor to Hipparcos, both of which
operated in optical wavelengths, and Gaia is two orders of magnitude more
accurate in the five astrometric parameters and is surveying four orders of
magnitude more stars in a vast volume of the Milky Way. The combination of the
Hipparcos/Tycho-2 catalogues with the first early Gaia data release will give
improved proper motions over a long ~25 year baseline. The final Gaia solution
will also establish a new optical reference frame by means of quasars, by
linking the optical counterparts of radio (VLBI) sources defining the
orientation of the reference frame, and by using the zero proper motion of
quasars to determine a non-rotating frame.
  A weakness of Gaia is that it only operates at optical wavelengths. However,
much of the Galactic centre and the spiral arm regions, important for certain
studies, are obscured by interstellar extinction and this makes it difficult
for Gaia to deeply probe. Traditionally, this problem is overcome by switching
to the infra-red but this was not possible with Gaia's CCDs. Additionally, to
scan the entire sky and make global absolute parallax measurements the
spacecraft must have a constant rotation and this requires that the CCDs
operate in TDI mode, increasing their complexity.

on the tunneling-induced decay of the state of a quantum dot by applying a
recently discovered general duality [PRB 93, 81411 (2016)]. This duality
provides deep physical insight into the decay dynamics of electronic open
quantum systems with strong Coulomb interaction. It associates the amplitudes
of decay eigenmodes of the actual system to the eigenmodes of a so-called dual
system with attractive interaction. Thereby, it predicts many surprising
features in the transient transport and its dependence on experimental control
parameters: the attractive interaction of the dual model shows up as sharp
features in the amplitudes of measurable time-dependent currents through the
actual repulsive system. In particular, for interacting quantum dots, the
time-dependent heat current exhibits a decay mode that dissipates the
interaction energy and that is tied to the fermion parity of the system. We
show that its decay amplitude has an unexpected gate-voltage dependence that is
robust up to sizable bias voltages and then bifurcates, reflecting that the
Coulomb blockade is lifted in the dual system. Furthermore, combining our
duality relation with the known Iche-duality, we derive new symmetry properties
of the decay rates as a function of magnetic field and gate voltage. Finally,
we quantify charge- and spin-mode mixing due to the magnetic field using a
single mixing parameter.

proposed in the past years. However, each of these mechanisms comes with
different configuration parameters that have a direct impact both on the
privacy guarantees offered to the users and on the resulting utility of the
protected data. In this context, it can be difficult for non-expert system
designers to choose the appropriate configuration to use. Moreover, these
mechanisms are generally configured once for all, which results in the same
configuration for every protected piece of information. However, not all users
have the same behaviour, and even the behaviour of a single user is likely to
change over time. To address this issue, we present in this paper ALP, a new
framework enabling the dynamic configuration of LPPMs. ALP can be used in two
scenarios: (1) offline, where ALP enables a system designer to choose and
automatically tune the most appropriate LPPM for the protection of a given
dataset; (2) online, where ALP enables the user of a crowd sensing application
to protect consecutive batches of her geolocated data by automatically tuning
an existing LPPM to fulfil a set of privacy and utility objectives. We evaluate
ALP on both scenarios with two real-life mobility datasets and two
state-of-the-art LPPMs. Our experiments show that the adaptive LPPM
configurations found by ALP outperform both in terms of privacy and utility a

of convergence of the expected signature of the linear piecewise approximation
of the fBm to its exact value, for a value of the Hurst parameter
$H\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$. We show that the rate of convergence is given by $2H$.
We believe that this rate is sharp as it is consistent with the result of Ni

(i.e. fBm with $H=\frac{1}{2}$) is given by $1$. The second result regards the
bound of the coefficient of the rate of convergence obtained in the first

the signature of $\frac{\tilde{A}k(2k-1)}{(k-1)!2^{k}}$, where $\tilde{A}$ is a
finite constant independent of $k$. The third result regards the sharp decay

investigate the existence of minimizers of the so-called neo-Hookean energy

exponent in the energy we must face a problem of lack of compactness. Indeed as
shown by an example of Conti-De Lellis, a phenomenon of concentration of energy
can occur preventing the strong convergence in $W^{1,2}(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^3)$
of a minimizing sequence along with the equi-integrability of the cofactors of
that sequence. We prove that this phenomenon can only take place on the axis of
symmetry of the domain. Thus if we consider domains that do not contain the
axis of symmetry then minimizers do exist. We also provide a partial
description of the lack of compactness in terms of Cartesian currents. Then we
study the case where $\Omega$ is not necessarily axisymmetric but the boundary
data is affine. In that case if we do not allow cavitation (nor in the interior
neither at the boundary) then the affine extension is the unique minimizer,
that is, quadratic polyconvex energies are $W^{1,2}$-quasiconvex in our
admissible space. At last, in the case of an axisymmetric domain not containing

Hemisphere, aiming at the detection of high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical

hemisphere of the sky, and are thus well-suited to detect neutrinos produced in
transient astrophysical sources. A timedependent search has been applied to a
list of 33 x-ray binaries undergoing high flaring activities in satellite data
(RXTE/ASM, MAXI and Swift/BAT) and during hardness transition states in the
2008-2012 period. The background originating from interactions of charged
cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere is drastically reduced by requiring a
directional and temporal coincidence with astrophysical phenomena. The results
of this search are presented together with comparisons between the neutrino
flux upper limits and the neutrino flux predictions from astrophysical models.
The neutrino flux upper limits resulting from this search limit the jet

opportunity to compensate the unstable behaviour of conventional vehicles.
Vehicles subject to perturbations should (i) recover their equilibrium speed,
(ii) react not to propagate but absorb perturbations. In this work, we start
with considering vehicle systems consisting of heterogeneous vehicles updating
their dynamics according to realistic behavioural car-following models.
Definitions of all types of stability that are of interest in the vehicle
system, namely input-output stability, scalability, weak and strict string
stability, are introduced based on recent studies. Then, frequency domain
linear stability analyses are conducted after linearisation of the modelled
system of vehicles, leading to conditions for input-output stability, strict
and weak string stability over the behavioural parameters of the system, for
finite and infinite systems of homogeneous and heterogeneous vehicles. This
provides a solid basis that was missing for car-following model-based control
design in mixed traffic systems where only a proportion of vehicles can be
controlled. After visualisation of the theoretical results in simulation, we
formulate an optimisation strategy with LMI constraints to tune the behavioural
parameters of the automated vehicles in order to maximise the L1 string

driving. The optimisation strategy systematically leads to increased traffic

their spatial and temporal properties in the US Western Interconnect (USWI)
power grid. We also introduce the preferential Degree And Distance Attachment
(DADA) model, with similar degree distributions, resistances, and currents to
the USWI. We investigate the behavior of both grids resulting from the failure
of a single line. We find that the DADA model and the USWI model react very
similarly to that failure, and that their blackout characteristics resemble
each other. In many cases, the failure of a single line can cause cascading
failures, which impact the entire grid. We characterize the resilience of the
grid by three parameters, the most important of which is tolerance ${\alpha}$,
which is the ratio of the maximal load a line can carry to its initial load. We
characterize a blackout by its yield, which we define as the ratio of the final
to the initial consumed currents. We find that if ${\alpha}\leq2$, the
probability of a large blackout occurring is very small. By contrast, in a
broad range of $1 < {\alpha} < 2$, the initial failure of a single line can
result, with a high probability, in cascading failures leading to a massive
blackout with final yield less than 80%. The yield has a bimodal distribution
typical of a first-order transition, i.e., the failure of a randomly selected
line leads either to an insignificant current reduction or to a major blackout.
We find that there is a latent period in the development of major blackouts
during which few lines are overloaded, and the yield remains high. The duration
of this latent period is proportional to the tolerance. The existence of the
latent period suggests that intervention during early time steps of a cascade
can significantly reduce the risk of a major blackout.

sources of quantum-correlated light. In particular, when pumped above
threshold, such devices generate a pair of bright orthogonally-polarized beams
with strong continuous-variable entanglement. However, these sources are of
limited practical use, because the entangled beams emerge with different
frequencies and a diffusing phase-difference. It has been proven that the use
of an internal wave-plate coupling the modes with orthogonal polarization is
capable of locking the frequencies of the emerging beams to half the pump
frequency, as well as reducing the phase-difference diffusion, at the expense
of reducing the entanglement levels. In this work we characterize theoretically
an alternative locking mechanism: the injection of a laser at half the pump
frequency. Apart from being less invasive, this method should allow for an
easier real-time experimental control. We show that such an injection is
capable of generating the desired phase locking between the emerging beams,
while still allowing for large levels of entanglement. Moreover, we find an
additional region of the parameter space (at relatively large injections) where
a mode with well defined polarization is in a highly squeezed vacuum state.

thermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, but the exact explosion
mechanism is still a matter of debate. Observation of a galactic SN Ia would be
of immense value in answering the many open questions related to these events.
One potentially useful source of information about the explosion mechanism and
progenitor is the neutrino signal.
  In this paper we compute the expected neutrino signal from a gravitationally
confined detonation (GCD) explosion scenario for a SN~Ia and show how the flux
at Earth contains features in time and energy unique to this scenario. We then
calculate the expected event rates in the Super-K, Hyper-K, JUNO, DUNE, and
IceCube detectors and find both Hyper-K and IceCube would see a few events for
a GCD supernova at 1 kpc or closer, while Super-K, JUNO, and DUNE would see a
events if the supernova were closer than ${\sim}0.3$ kpc. The distance and
detector criteria needed to resolve the time and spectral features arising from
the explosion mechanism, neutrino production, and neutrino oscillation
processes are also discussed.
  The neutrino signal from the GCD is then compared with the signal from a
deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) explosion model computed
previously. We find the overall event rate is the most discriminating feature
between the two scenarios followed by the event rate time structure. Using the
event rate in the Hyper-K detector alone, the DDT can be distinguished from the
GCD at 2$\sigma$ if the distance to the supernova is less than $2.3\;{\rm kpc}$

degrade significantly in the presence of high background noise. We introduce a
new approach to depth and reflectivity estimation that focuses on unmixing
contributions from signal and noise sources. At each pixel in an image,
short-duration range gates are adaptively determined and applied to remove
detections likely to be due to noise. For pixels with too few detections to
perform this censoring accurately, we borrow data from neighboring pixels to
improve depth estimates, where the neighborhood formation is also adaptive to
scene content. Algorithm performance is demonstrated on experimental data at
varying levels of noise. Results show improved performance of both reflectivity
and depth estimates over state-of-the-art methods, especially at low

novelty is that at the same time we allow the function $\phi$ to be from an

signal temporal logic (STL) specifications by agents with unknown stochastic
dynamics. The system is modeled as a Markov decision process, in which the
states represent partitions of a continuous space and the transition
probabilities are unknown. We formulate two synthesis problems where the
desired STL specification is enforced by maximizing the probability of
satisfaction, and the expected robustness degree, that is, a measure
quantifying the quality of satisfaction. We discuss that Q-learning is not
directly applicable to these problems because, based on the quantitative
semantics of STL, the probability of satisfaction and expected robustness
degree are not in the standard objective form of Q-learning. To resolve this
issue, we propose an approximation of STL synthesis problems that can be solved
via Q-learning, and we derive some performance bounds for the policies obtained
by the approximate approach. The performance of the proposed method is
demonstrated via simulations.

equations of the form \begin{align*} A_Sx_S&+A_Px_P =0\\ A'_Sx_S & =0,
\end{align*} where our primary interest might be in the vector variable $x_P.$
Usually, neither $x_S$ nor $x_P$ can be written as a function of the other but
they are linked through the linear relationship, that of $(x_S,x_P) $ belonging
to $\mathcal{V}_{SP},$ the solution space of the first of the two equations. If
$\mathcal{V}_{S}$ is the solution space of the second equation, we may regard
the final space of solutions $\mathcal{V}_{P}$ as derived from the other two
spaces by an operation, say, `$\mathcal{V}_{P}=\mathcal{V}_{SP}\leftrightarrow
\mathcal{V}_{S}.$' This operation, together with linear relationships, can be
used to build a version of linear algebra which we call `implicit linear
algebra'. There are two basic results - an `implicit inversion theorem' which
describes when $\mathcal{V}_{S}$ can be obtained from $\mathcal{V}_{P}$ and
$\mathcal{V}_{SP},$ and an `implicit duality theorem' which says
$\mathcal{V}_{P}^{\bot}=\mathcal{V}_{SP}^{\bot}\leftrightarrow
\mathcal{V}_{S}^{\bot}.$ These notions originally arose in the building of
circuit simulators. They have been reinterpreted for the present purpose. Using
them, we develop an algorithmic version of linear multivariable control theory,
avoiding the computationally expensive idea of state equations. We replace them
by `emulators', which are easy to build, but can achieve most of whatever can
be done with state equations. We define the notions of generalized autonomous
systems and generalized operators, and develop a primitive spectral theory for
the latter. Using these ideas, we develop the usual controllability -
observability duality, state and output feedback, pole placement etc.

the formation of directional heat fluxes in the passages between the holes.
Next, we use these nanostructures as a directional source of ballistic phonons

nanoscale thermal lens in which the phonons converge at a focal point, thus

can routinely be solved numerically by virtue of perfectly matched layers
(PMLs) at simulation domain boundaries. Unfortunately, the same has not been
possible for general elastodynamic wave problems in continuum mechanics. In
this paper, we introduce a corresponding scattered-field formulation for the
Navier equation. We derive PMLs based on complex-valued coordinate
transformations leading to Cosserat elasticity-tensor distributions not obeying
the minor symmetries. These layers are shown to work in two dimensions, for all
polarizations, and all directions. By adaptative choice of the decay length,
the deep subwavelength PMLs can be used all the way to the quasi-static regime.
As demanding examples, we study the effectiveness of cylindrical elastodynamic
cloaks of the Cosserat type and approximations thereof.

single-walled carbon nano-tubes (SWCNTs) as a function of energy and dose
identify the nature of the resulting damage in the form of multiple vacancy
generation. For pristine SWCNTs at all Cs+ energies, C2 is the most dominant
species, followed by C3, C4 and C1. The experiments were performed in three
stages: in the first stage, Cs+ energy E(Cs+) was varied. During the second
stage, the nanotubes were irradiated continuously at E(Cs+) = 5 keV for 1,800
s. Afterwards, the entire sequence of irradiation energies was repeated to
differentiate between the fragmentation patterns of the pristine and of heavily
irradiated SWCNTs. The sputtering and normalized yields identify the
quantitative and relative extent of the ion-induced damage by creating double,
triple and quadruple vacancies; the single vacancies are least favored.
Sputtering from the heavily irradiated SWCNTs occurs not only from the damaged
and fragmented nanotubes, but also from the inter-nanotube structures that are
grown due to the accumulation of the sputtered clusters. Similar irradiation
experiments were performed with the multi-walled carbon nanotubes; the results
confirmed the dominant C2 followed by C3, C4 and C1.

  Physics (JAMP)",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We analyze spacetimes with horizons and study the thermodynamic aspects of
causal horizons, suggesting that the resemblance between gravitational and
thermodynamic systems has a deeper quantum mechanical origin. We find that the
observer dependence of such horizons is a direct consequence of associating a
temperature and entropy to a spacetime. The geometrical picture of a horizon
acting as a one-way membrane for information flow can be accepted as a natural
interpretation of assigning a quantum field theory to a spacetime with
boundary, ultimately leading to a close connection with thermodynamics.

  to Customers","24 pages",,,,"math.OC math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Delay or queue length information has the potential to influence the decision
of a customer to use a service system. Thus, it is imperative for service
system managers to understand how the information that they provide will affect
the performance of the system. To this end, we construct and analyze two
two-dimensional deterministic fluid models that incorporate customer choice
behavior based on delayed queue length information. In the first fluid model,
customers join each queue according to a Multinomial Logit Model, however, the
queue length information the customer receives is delayed by a constant
$\Delta$. We show that the delay can cause oscillations or asynchronous
behavior in the model based on the value of $\Delta$. In the second model,
customers receive information about the queue length through a moving average
of the queue length. Although it has been shown empirically that giving
patients moving average information causes oscillations and asynchronous
behavior to occur in U.S. hospitals in the work of Dong et al., we analytically
and mathematically show for the first time that the moving average fluid model
can exhibit oscillations and determine their dependence on the moving average
window. Thus, our analysis provides new insight on how managers of service
systems information systems should report queue length information to customers
and how delayed information can produce unwanted behavior.
