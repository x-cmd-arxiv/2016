distances, which is a ratio between some higher moments and some powers of the
variance. As a corollary, it gives an estimate for the normal approximation of
the small jumps of the L\'evy processes, and Fournier applied that to the Euler
approximation of L\'evy-driven stochastic differential equations. However both
results are restricted to the one-dimensional case. It will be shown in this
article that, following Davie's idea, one can generalise Rio's result to
multidimensional case, and the number of moments required is independent of the
dimension. Also two different approaches are developed to simulate
multidimensional L\'evy SDEs: one as a corollary to the central limit bound,
the other directly derived from the L\'evy-Khinchine formula.

an electronically flat-level solution surface. On dissociation from the
precursor, atoms amalgamate at the solution surface. On supplying the tuned
bipolar or unipolar pulses from different sources, the development of the tiny
particles is in triangular shapes. The developing tiny-shaped particles become
the building blocks of later developed bigger-sized particles. On development,
tiny-shaped particles leave the electronically flat-leveled solution surface.
By entering the electronically decreasing-level solution surface, tiny-shaped
particles arrive at the center of the concave meniscus. Through different
approaches, the nano energy packets supply to develop tiny-shaped particles. In
a triangular shape tiny particle, atomic arrays convert into structures of
smooth elements, where traveling photons along the air-solution interface
further flatten them. So, they nucleated a mono-layer shape. For later
coalesced tiny particles, structures of smooth elements adjacently adhered to
grow a nucleated mono-layer. The developing tiny-sized and tiny-shaped
particles do not appear to qualify for the extensively studied surface plasmons
phenomenon. In the upper-shaped mono-layer, the force of gravity becomes more
significant than the force of levity. The opposite is the case in the
lower-shaped mono-layer. Only a few microseconds are involved in adhering to
two mono-layers. The study highlights the development process of tiny-sized
particles in selective shapes. The study has great potential in the fields of
nanoscience and nanotechnology.

complex of parallel dense molecular filaments projected on the plane of the
sky. Previous dust emission and molecular-line studies have speculated whether
magnetic fields could have played an important role in the formation of such
long-shaped structures, which are hosts to numerous young stellar sources. In
this work we have conducted a vast polarimetric survey at optical and
near-infrared wavelengths in order to study the morphology of magnetic field
lines in IRDC G14.2 through the observation of background stars. The
orientation of interstellar polarization, which traces magnetic field lines, is
perpendicular to most of the filamentary features within the cloud.
Additionally, the larger-scale molecular cloud as a whole exhibits an elongated
shape also perpendicular to magnetic fields. Estimates of magnetic field
strengths indicate values in the range $320 - 550\,\mu$G, which allows
sub-alfv\'enic conditions, but does not prevent the gravitational collapse of
hub-filament structures, which in general are close to the critical state.
These characteristics suggest that magnetic fields played the main role in
regulating the collapse from large to small scales, leading to the formation of
series of parallel elongated structures. The morphology is also consistent with
numerical simulations that show how gravitational instabilities develop under
strong magnetic fields. Finally, the results corroborate the hypothesis that a
strong support from internal magnetic fields might explain why the cloud seems
to be contracting on a time scale 2-3 times larger than what is expected from a
free-fall collapse.

by the dynamics of bodies in the outer system. We consider two scenarios: outer
systems of giant planets potentially unstable to planet--planet scattering, and
wide binaries that may be capable of driving Kozai or other secular variations
of outer planets' eccentricities. Dynamical excitation of planets in the outer
system reduces the multiplicity of Kepler-detectable planets in the inner
system in $\sim20-25\%$ of our systems. Accounting for the occurrence rates of
wide-orbit planets and binary stars, $\approx18\%$ of close-in systems could be
destabilised by their outer companions in this way. This provides some
contribution to the apparent excess of systems with a single transiting planet
compared to multiple, however, it only contributes at most $25\%$ of the
excess. The effects of the outer dynamics can generate systems similar to
Kepler-56 (two coplanar planets significantly misaligned with the host star)
and Kepler-108 (two significantly non-coplanar planets in a binary). We also
identify three pathways to the formation of eccentric warm Jupiters resulting
from the interaction between outer and inner systems: direct inelastic
collision between an eccentric outer and an inner planet, secular eccentricity
oscillations that may ""freeze out"" when scattering resolves in the outer
system; and scattering in the inner system followed by ""uplift"", where inner
planets are removed by interaction with the outer planets. In these scenarios,
the formation of eccentric warm Jupiters is a signature of a past history of
violent dynamics among massive planets beyond $\sim1$ au.

found in many application domains including: optimal control of hybrid systems,

nonconvex optimization problems with an L1-constraint can be approximately
solved in polynomial time. We first show that nonlinear integer programs with

in the dimension of the decision variable, for each fixed radius of the

shows that such problems have a time complexity that is polynomial in
simultaneously both the dimension of the decision variables and number of

using a geometric argument that leverages ideas from stochastic process theory
and from the theory of convex bodies in high-dimensional spaces. We conclude by
providing an additive polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for
continuous optimization of Lipschitz functions subject to Lipschitz constraints
intersected with an L1-constraint, and we sketch a generalization to
mixed-integer optimization.

rapidly emerging hybrid imaging technique that possesses great potential for a
wide range of biomedical imaging applications. In OAT, a laser is employed to
illuminate the tissue of interest and acoustic signals are produced via the
photoacoustic effect. From these data, an estimate of the distribution of the
absorbed optical energy density within the tissue is reconstructed, referred to
as the object function. This quantity is defined, in part, by the distribution
of light fluence within the tissue that is established by the laser source.
When performing three-dimensional imaging of large objects, such as a female
human breast, it can be difficult to achieve a relatively uniform coverage of
light fluence within the volume of interest when the position of the laser
source is fixed. To circumvent this, researchers have proposed illumination
schemes in which the relative position of the laser source and ultrasound probe
is fixed, and both are rotated together to acquire a tomographic data set. A
problem with this rotating-illumination scheme is that the tomographic data are
inconsistent; namely, the acoustic data recorded at each tomographic view angle
(i.e., probe position) are produced by a distinct object function. In this
work, the impact of this data inconsistency on image reconstruction accuracy is
investigated systematically. This is accomplished by use of computer-simulation
studies and application of mathematical results from the theory of microlocal
analysis. These studies specify the set of image discontinuities that can be
stably reconstructed with a non-stationary optical illumination set-up. The
study also includes a comparison of the ability of iterative and analytic image
reconstruction methods to mitigate artifacts attributable to the data
inconsistency.

significant background variations and observation noises. The work is motivated
by the need of identifying foreground regions in noisy microscopic image or
degraded document images, where significant background variation and severe
noise make an image binarization challenging. The proposed method first
estimates the background of an input image, subtracts the estimated background
from the input image, and apply a global thresholding to the subtracted outcome
for achieving a binary image of foregrounds. A robust regression approach was
proposed to estimate the background intensity surface with minimal effects of
foreground intensities and noises, and a global threshold selector was proposed
on the basis of a model selection criterion in a sparse regression. The
proposed approach was validated using 26 test images and the corresponding
ground truths, and the outcomes of the proposed work were compared with those
from nine existing image binarization methods. The approach was also combined
with three state-of-the-art morphological segmentation methods to show how the
proposed approach can improve their image segmentation outcomes.

overlapping photos, but its images must be both captured and processed
correctly to produce an acceptable composite. We propose Swipe Mosaics, an
interactive visualization that places the individual video frames on a 2D
planar map that represents the layout of the physical scene. Compared to
traditional panoramic mosaics, our capture is easier because the user can both
translate the camera center and film moving subjects. Processing and display
degrade gracefully if the footage lacks distinct, overlapping, non-repeating
texture. Our proposed visual odometry algorithm produces a distribution over
(x,y) translations for image pairs. Inferring a distribution of possible camera
motions allows us to better cope with parallax, lack of texture, dynamic
scenes, and other phenomena that hurt deterministic reconstruction techniques.
Robustness is obtained by training on synthetic scenes with known camera
motions. We show that Swipe Mosaics are easy to generate, support a wide range
of difficult scenes, and are useful for documenting a scene for closer
inspection.

  implications of the diverse neural substrates underlying human memory systems",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The neural basis of human memory is incredibly complex. We argue that the
diversity of neural systems underlying various forms of memory suggests that
any discussion of enhancing 'memory' per se is too broad, thus obfuscating the
biopolitical debate about human enhancement. Memory can be differentiated into
at least four major (and several minor) systems with largely dissociable (i.e.,
non-overlapping) neural substrates. We outline each system, and discuss both
the practical and the ethical implications of these diverse neural substrates.
In practice, distinct neural bases imply the possibility, and likely the
necessity, of specific approaches for the safe and effective enhancement of
various memory systems. In the debate over the ethical and social implications
of enhancement technologies, this fine-grained perspective clarifies - and may
partially mitigate - certain common concerns in enhancement debates, including
issues related to safety, fairness, coercion, and authenticity. While many
researchers certainly appreciate the neurobiological complexity of memory, the
political debate tends to revolve around a monolithic one-size-fits-all
conception. The overall project - exploring how human enhancement technologies
affect society - stands to benefit from a deeper appreciation of memory's
neurobiological diversity.

the theory of homophily, which implies that socially linked individuals share
interests, and are therefore likely to mention the same sorts of entities. We
implement this idea by encoding authors, mentions, and entities in a continuous
vector space, which is constructed so that socially-connected authors have
similar vector representations. These vectors are incorporated into a neural
structured prediction model, which captures structural constraints that are

Includes 9 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.94.165131",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The shandite family of solids, with hexagonal structure and composition
A3M2X2 (A = Ni,Co,Rh,Pd; M = Pb,In,Sn,Tl; X = S,Se), has attracted recent
research attention due to promising applications as thermoelectric materials.
Herein we discuss the electron and phonon transport properties of
shandite-structured Ni3Sn2S2, based on a combination of density functional
theory (DFT), Boltzmann transport theory, and experimental measurements.
Ni3Sn2S2 exhibits a metallic and non-magnetic groundstate with Ni$^0$ oxidation
state and very low charge on Sn and S atoms. Seebeck coefficients obtained from
theoretical calculations are in excellent agreement with those measured
experimentally between 100 and 600 K. From the calculation of the ratio
$\sigma$/$\tau$ between the electronic conductivity and relaxation time, and
the experimental determination of electron conductivity, we extract the
variation of the scattering rate (1/$\tau$) with temperature between 300 and
600 K, which turns out to be almost linear, thus implying that the dominant
electron scattering mechanism in this temperature range is via phonons. The
electronic thermal conductivity, which deviates only slightly from the
Wiedemann-Franz law, provides the main contribution to thermal transport. The
small lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity is calculated from the
phonon structure and third-order force constants, and is only ~2
Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at 300 K (less than 10% of the total thermal conductivity),
which is confirmed by experimental measurements. Overall, Ni$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ is
a poor thermoelectric material (ZT~0.01 at 300 K), principally due to the low
absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient. However, the understanding of its
transport properties will be useful for the rationalization of the
thermoelectric behavior of other, more promising members of the shandite
family.

of electronic structure theory, namely the second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset (MP2)

triples correction to the coupled cluster singles and doubles model (CCSD(T)).
By means of compute directives as well as the use of optimized device math
libraries, the operations involved in the energy kernels have been ported to
graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerators, and the associated data transfers
correspondingly optimized to such a degree that the final implementations
(using either double and/or single precision arithmetics) are capable of
scaling to as large systems as allowed for by the capacity of the host central
processing unit (CPU) main memory. The performance of the hybrid CPU/GPU
implementations is assessed through calculations on test systems of alanine
amino acid chains using one-electron basis sets of increasing size (ranging
from double- to pentuple-zeta quality). For all but the smallest problem sizes
of the present study, the optimized accelerated codes (using a single
multi-core CPU host node in conjunction with six GPUs) are found to be capable
of reducing the total time-to-solution by at least an order of magnitude over
optimized, OpenMP-threaded CPU-only reference implementations.

  beyond sparse graphs?","23 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.DS cs.CC math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the last years, kernelization with structural parameters has been an
active area of research within the field of parameterized complexity. As a
relevant example, Gajarsk{\`y} et al. [ESA 2013] proved that every graph
problem satisfying a property called finite integer index admits a linear
kernel on graphs of bounded expansion and an almost linear kernel on nowhere
dense graphs, parameterized by the size of a $c$-treedepth modulator, which is
a vertex set whose removal results in a graph of treedepth at most $c$, where
$c \geq 1$ is a fixed integer. The authors left as further research to
investigate this parameter on general graphs, and in particular to find
problems that, while admitting polynomial kernels on sparse graphs, behave
differently on general graphs.
  In this article we answer this question by finding two very natural such
problems: we prove that Vertex Cover admits a polynomial kernel on general
graphs for any integer $c \geq 1$, and that Dominating Set does not for any
integer $c \geq 2$ even on degenerate graphs, unless $\text{NP} \subseteq
\text{coNP}/\text{poly}$. For the positive result, we build on the techniques
of Jansen and Bodlaender [STACS 2011], and for the negative result we use a
polynomial parameter transformation for $c\geq 3$ and an OR-cross-composition
for $c = 2$. As existing results imply that Dominating Set admits a polynomial
kernel on degenerate graphs for $c = 1$, our result provides a dichotomy about
the existence of polynomial kernels for Dominating Set on degenerate graphs
with this parameter.

through task-specific embeddings. With causality as a use case, we implement
this insight in three steps. First, we generate causal embeddings
cost-effectively by bootstrapping cause-effect pairs extracted from free text

this data, by using task-specific contexts, i.e., the context of a cause is its
effect. Finally, we extend a state-of-the-art reranking approach for QA to

both directly with a casual implication task, and indirectly, in a downstream
causal QA task using data from Yahoo! Answers. We show that explicitly modeling
causality improves performance in both tasks. In the QA task our best model

rate of the precipitate is found to be proportional to the square root of time,
which is characteristic of diffusive transport. However, the dependence of the
growth rate on the concentrations of hydroxide and metal ions is approximately
linear and quadratic, respectively. We show that such a difference in ionic
transport dynamics arises from the enhanced transport of metal ions across a
thin gel layer present at the surface of the precipitate. The fluctuations in
transverse velocity in this wavy porous gel layer allow an enhanced transport
of the cation, so that the effective diffusivity is about an order of magnitude
higher than that expected from molecular diffusion alone. Our theoretical

Corteel-Martinez-Savage-Weselcouch through a systematic study of inversion

generalizing the notion of a pattern to a fixed triple of binary relations

interesting enumeration results and relate pattern avoiding inversion sequences

phenomenon arising from inherent magnetization and spin-orbit coupling. Various
theoretical and experimental efforts have been devoted in search of robust
intrinsic QAH insulators. However, up to now, it has only been observed in Cr
or V doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 film in experiments with very low working temperature.
Based on the successful synthesis of transition metal halides, we use
first-principles calculations to predict that RuI3 monolayer is an intrinsic
ferromagnetic QAH insulator with a topologically nontrivial global band gap of
11 meV. This topologically nontrivial band gap at the Fermi level is due to its
crystal symmetry, thus the QAH effect is robust. Its Curie temperature,
estimated to be ~360 K using Monte-Carlo simulation, is above room temperature
and higher than most of two-dimensional ferromagnetic thin films. We also
discuss the manipulation of its exchange energy and nontrivial band gap by
applying in-plane strain. Our work adds a new experimentally feasible member to
the QAH insulator family, which is expected to have broad applications in
nanoelectronics and spintronics.

strategies in order to provide a high customer quality of service (QoS).
Previous works on autonomous MOD systems have developed methods for rebalancing
single capacity vehicles, where QoS is maintained through large fleet sizing.
This work focuses on MOD systems utilizing a small number of vehicles, such as
those found on a campus, where additional vehicles cannot be introduced as
demand for rides increases. A predictive positioning method is presented for
improving customer QoS by identifying key locations to position the fleet in
order to minimize expected customer wait time. Ridesharing is introduced as a
means for improving customer QoS as arrival rates increase. However, with
ridesharing perceived QoS is dependent on an often unknown customer preference.
To address this challenge, a customer ratings model, which learns customer
preference from a 5-star rating, is developed and incorporated directly into a
ridesharing algorithm. The predictive positioning and ridesharing methods are
applied to simulation of a real-world campus MOD system.A combined predictive
positioning and ridesharing approach is shown to reduce customer service times
by up to 29% and the customer ratings model is shown to provide the best
overall MOD fleet management performance over a range of customer preferences.

bosonic quantum nature of the field and the fermionic quantum nature of its

either flat like Frenkel excitons, or localized like Wannier excitons. We show
that for Frenkel-like cobosons, complete erasure of the field quantum nature is
possible up to a density which corresponds to a sizable fraction of the number
of fermion-pair states making the coboson at hand. At higher density, the Pauli
exclusion principle between fermionic constituents shows up dramatically. It
induces: (i) the decrease of number-operator eigenvalues down to 1 and the
increase of the number-state second-order correlation function up to 2; (ii)
the disappearance of the usual sharp peak in the coherent-state distribution

a classical field. The basic idea is that if an observable quantity depends
quadratically upon a quantum field, such as the electric field, then the
application of a classical field produces a cross term between the classical
and quantum fields. This cross term may be significantly larger than the purely
quantum part, but also undergoes fluctuations driven by the quantum field. We
illustrate this effect in a model for lightcone fluctuations involving pulses
in a nonlinear dielectric. Vacuum electric field fluctuations produce
fluctuations in the speed of a probe pulse, and form an analog model for
quantum gravity effects. If the material has a nonzero third-order
susceptibility, then the fractional light speed fluctuations are proportional
to the square of the fluctuating electric field. Hence the application of a
classical electric field can enhance the speed fluctuations. We give an example
where this enhancement can be an increase of one order of magnitude, increasing
the possibility of observing the effect.

systematically improved in the last decade, mostly thanks to space-borne
photometric missions and ground-based spectrographs dedicated to finding
exoplanets. The field of eclipsing binary stars strongly benefited from this
development. Eclipsing binaries serve as critical tools for determining
fundamental stellar properties (masses, radii, temperatures and luminosities),
yet the models are not capable of reproducing observed data well either because
of the missing physics or because of insufficient precision. This led to a
predicament where radiative and dynamical effects, insofar buried in noise,
started showing up routinely in the data, but were not accounted for in the
models. PHOEBE (PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs; http://phoebe-project.org) is an
open source modeling code for computing theoretical light and radial velocity
curves that addresses both problems by incorporating missing physics and by
increasing the computational fidelity. In particular, we discuss triangulation
as a superior surface discretization algorithm, meshing of rotating single
stars, light time travel effect, advanced phase computation, volume
conservation in eccentric orbits, and improved computation of local intensity
across the stellar surfaces that includes photon-weighted mode, enhanced limb
darkening treatment, better reflection treatment and Doppler boosting. Here we
present the concepts on which PHOEBE is built on and proofs of concept that
demonstrate the increased model fidelity.

information-theoretic capacity of this problem, which is defined as the maximum
number of bits of the desired message that can be privately retrieved per one
bit of downloaded information. We show that the PIR capacity in this case is
$C=\left(1+\frac{K}{N}+\frac{K^2}{N^2}+\cdots+\frac{K^{M-1}}{N^{M-1}}\right)^{-1}=(1+R_c+R_c^2+\cdots+R_c^{M-1})^{-1}=\frac{1-R_c}{1-R_c^M}$,

observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB): it smooths the acoustic

previously uncorrelated modes; and it converts $E$-mode polarization into
$B$-mode polarization. The act of measuring and removing the effect of lensing
from CMB maps, or delensing, has been well studied in the context of $B$ modes,
but little attention has been given to the delensing of the temperature and $E$
modes. In this paper, we model the expected delensed $T$ and $E$ power spectra
to all orders in the lensing potential, demonstrating the sharpening of the
acoustic peaks and a significant reduction in lens-induced power spectrum
covariances. We then perform cosmological forecasts, demonstrating that
delensing will yield improved sensitivity to parameters with upcoming surveys.
We highlight the breaking of the degeneracy between the effective number of
neutrino species and primordial helium fraction as a concrete application. We
also show that delensing increases cosmological information as long as the
measured lensing reconstruction is included in the analysis. We conclude that
with future data, delensing will be crucial not only for primordial $B$-mode
science but for a range of other observables as well.

  Human and Machine Translation",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for
automated translation, with the potential to overcome many of the weaknesses of
conventional phrase-based translation systems. Unfortunately, NMT systems are
known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation
inference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues
have hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both
accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's
Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these
issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder
layers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and
therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom
layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final
translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference
computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited
set of common sub-word units (""wordpieces"") for both input and output. This
method provides a good balance between the flexibility of ""character""-delimited
models and the efficiency of ""word""-delimited models, naturally handles
translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the
system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and
uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that
is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14
English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive
results to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of
isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60%
compared to Google's phrase-based production system.

(SLSNe-I) PTF12dam and iPTF13dcc, discovered by the (intermediate) Palomar
Transient Factory. Both show excess emission at early times and a slowly
declining light curve at late times. The early bump in PTF12dam is very similar
in duration (~10 days) and brightness relative to the main peak (2-3 mag
fainter) compared to those observed in other SLSNe-I. In contrast, the
long-duration (>30 days) early excess emission in iPTF13dcc, whose brightness
competes with that of the main peak, appears to be of a different nature. We
construct bolometric light curves for both targets, and fit a variety of
light-curve models to both the early bump and main peak in an attempt to
understand the nature of these explosions. Even though the slope of the
late-time light-curve decline in both SLSNe is suggestively close to that
expected from the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni and $^{56}$Co, the amount of
nickel required to power the full light curves is too large considering the
estimated ejecta mass. The magnetar model including an increasing escape
fraction provides a reasonable description of the PTF12dam observations.
However, neither the basic nor the double-peaked magnetar model is capable of
reproducing the iPTF13dcc light curve. A model combining a shock breakout in an
extended envelope with late-time magnetar energy injection provides a
reasonable fit to the iPTF13dcc observations. Finally, we find that the light
curves of both PTF12dam and iPTF13dcc can be adequately fit with the

numerical simulation (DNS) of a turbulent plane channel flow with streamwise
rotation and a preceding Lie-group symmetry analysis on the two-point
correlation equation (TPC) to analytically predict the scaling of the mean
velocity profiles for different rotation rates. We will only comment on the
latter part, since the DNS result obtained in the former part has already been
commented on by Recktenwald et al. (2009), stating that the observed mismatch
between DNS and their performed experiment is possibly due to the prescription
of periodic boundary conditions on a too small computational domain in the
spanwise direction. By revisiting the group analysis part in Oberlack et al.
(2006), we will generate more natural scaling laws describing better the mean
velocity profiles than the ones proposed. However, due to the statistical
closure problem of turbulence, this improvement is illusive. As we will
demonstrate, any arbitrary invariant scaling law for the mean velocity profiles
can be generated consistent to any higher order in the velocity correlations.
This problem of arbitrariness in invariant scaling persists even if we would
formally consider the infinite statistical hierarchy of all multi-point
correlation equations. The closure problem of turbulence simply cannot be
circumvented by just employing the method of Lie-group symmetry analysis alone:
as the statistical equations are unclosed, so are their symmetries! Hence, an a
priori prediction as how turbulence scales is thus not possible. Only a
posteriori by anticipating what to expect from numerical or experimental data
the adequate invariant scaling law can be generated through an iterative
trial-and-error process. Finally, apart from this issue, also several
inconsistencies and incorrect statements to be found in Oberlack et al. (2006)

molecule-bath and molecule-field interaction strengths, and reveal that its

stellar systems with little or no dark matter. This universality means that the
relationship can be applied without further knowledge or prejudice regarding
the structure of a galaxy. We then estimate the velocity dispersions of UDGs
drawn from two published samples and examine the distribution of total masses.
We find, in agreement with the previous studies of two individual UDGs, that
these systems are dark matter dominated systems, and that they span a range of
at least $10^{10} < M_{200}/M_\odot < 10^{12} $. These galaxies are not, as an

sense that the average of any t-th order polynomial over the design equals the
average over the entire unitary group. In various fields -- e.g. quantum
information theory -- one frequently encounters constructions that rely on
matrices drawn uniformly at random from the unitary group. Often, it suffices
to sample these matrices from a unitary t-design, for sufficiently high t. This
results in more explicit, derandomized constructions. The most prominent
unitary t-design considered in quantum information is the multi-qubit Clifford
group. It is known to be a unitary 3-design, but, unfortunately, not a
4-design. Here, we give a simple, explicit characterization of the way in which
the Clifford group fails to constitute a 4-design. Our results show that for
various applications in quantum information theory and in the theory of convex
signal recovery, Clifford orbits perform almost as well as those of true
4-designs. Technically, it turns out that in a precise sense, the 4th tensor
power of the Clifford group affords only one more invariant subspace than the
4th tensor power of the unitary group. That additional subspace is a stabilizer
code -- a structure extensively studied in the field of quantum error
correction codes. The action of the Clifford group on this stabilizer code can
be decomposed explicitly into previously known irreps of the discrete
symplectic group. We give various constructions of exact complex projective
4-designs or approximate 4-designs of arbitrarily high precision from Clifford
orbits. Building on results from coding theory, we give strong evidence

are used to formulate quantum statistical mechanics as a formally exact double
perturbation expansion about classical statistical mechanics. One series of
quantum contributions arises from the non-commutativity of the position and
momentum operators. Although the formulation of the quantum states differs, the
present results for separate averages of position operators and of momentum
operators agree with Wigner (1932) and Kirkwood (1933). The second series
arises from wave function symmetrization, and is given in terms of $l$-particle
permutation loops in an infinite order re-summation. The series gives
analytically the known exact result for the quantum ideal gas to all orders.
The leading correction corrects a correction given by Kirkwood.
  The first four quantum corrections to the grand potential are calculated for
a Lennard-Jones fluid using the hypernetted chain closure. For helium on liquid
branch isotherms, the corrections range from several times to 1\% of the total
classical pressure, with the effects of non-commutativity being significantly
larger in magnitude than those of wave function symmetrization. All corrections
are found to be negligible for argon at the densities and temperatures studied.
The calculations are computationally trivial as the method avoids having to
compute eigenfunctions, eigenvalues, and numerical symmetrization.

particles and by 7% - 10% for halos sampled with 500 particles. To control this
bias at low particle numbers we propose a new algorithm that estimates halo
concentrations based on the integrated mass profile. The method uses the full
particle information without any binning, making it reliable in cases when low
numerical resolution becomes a limitation for other methods. This method
reduces the bias to less than 3% for halos sampled with 200-500 particles. The
velocity and density methods have to use halos with at least 4000 particles in
order to keep the biases down to the same low level. We also show that the
mass-concentration relationship could be shallower than expected once the
biases of the different concentration measurements are taken into account.

to solve a single linear PDE, but where each subdomain of a partitioned domain
is associated to a distinct variational formulation coming from a mutually
well-posed family of broken variational formulations of the original PDE. It
can be exploited to solve challenging problems in a variety of physical
scenarios where stability or a particular mode of convergence is desired in a
part of the domain. The linear elasticity equations are solved in this work,
but the approach can be applied to other equations as well. The broken
variational formulations, which are essentially extensions of more standard
formulations, are characterized by the presence of mesh-dependent broken test
spaces and interface trial variables at the boundaries of the elements of the
mesh. This allows necessary information to be naturally transmitted between
adjacent subdomains, resulting in coupled variational formulations which are
then proved to be globally well-posed. They are solved numerically using the
DPG methodology, which is especially crafted to produce stable discretizations
of broken formulations. Finally, expected convergence rates are verified in two
different and illustrative examples.

The substitutions also increase the range of temperature and field where the
skyrmion phase is stable due to a change in the character of the magnetism. In
contrast to the behavior of pure MnSi and expectations for the intrinsic
anomalous Hall effect, we find a significant temperature dependence to the
magnitude and sign of anomalous Hall conductivity constant in Al or Ga

spin-orbit coupling strength with temperature, which may have significant
consequences on the helical and skyrmion states. Overall, we observe a

within the conventional electrical grid which powers base stations (BS).
Energy-aware traffic offloading brings a promising solution to maintain the
user performance while reducing the carbon footprint. Focusing on downlink
cellular networks consisting of on-grid, off-grid and hybrid BSs, we propose a
novel power-aware biased cell association where each user independently
partitions BSs into two sets and applies different association biases for each,
depending on the type of power, renewable or not, that can be requested for
service. The gain provided by such strategy regarding the probability of power
outage and the average grid power consumption is investigated. To capture their
dual nature, the bias applied for association with a hybrid BS is not constant
among users nor over time, and is dynamically tailored to the fluctuations of
the BS battery level, the user power requirement and the estimated power
consumed to serve other users potentially associated with the same BS. Such
approach allows to efficiently share the available energy among BSs and turns
high heterogeneity in the BS powering into advantage.

network (""correlation attacks"") have generally relied on analyzing traffic from
TCP connections. The TCP connections of a typical client application, however,
are often accompanied by DNS requests and responses. This additional traffic
presents more opportunities for correlation attacks. This paper quantifies how
DNS traffic can make Tor users more vulnerable to correlation attacks. We
investigate how incorporating DNS traffic can make existing correlation attacks
more powerful and how DNS lookups can leak information to third parties about
anonymous communication. We (i) develop a method to identify the DNS resolvers
of Tor exit relays; (ii) develop a new set of correlation attacks (DefecTor
attacks) that incorporate DNS traffic to improve precision; (iii) analyze the
Internet-scale effects of these new attacks on Tor users; and (iv) develop
improved methods to evaluate correlation attacks. First, we find that there
exist adversaries who can mount DefecTor attacks: for example, Google's DNS
resolver observes almost 40% of all DNS requests exiting the Tor network. We
also find that DNS requests often traverse ASes that the corresponding TCP
connections do not transit, enabling additional ASes to gain information about
Tor users' traffic. We then show that an adversary who can mount a DefecTor
attack can often determine the website that a Tor user is visiting with perfect
precision, particularly for less popular websites where the set of DNS names
associated with that website may be unique to the site. We also use the Tor
Path Simulator (TorPS) in combination with traceroute data from vantage points
co-located with Tor exit relays to estimate the power of AS-level adversaries
who might mount DefecTor attacks in practice.

nonpolar/hydrophobic but relatively high in polar, charged, and aromatic amino
acid compositions. Some IDPs undergo liquid-liquid phase separation in the
aqueous milieu of the living cell. The resulting phase with enhanced IDP
concentration can function as a major component of membraneless organelles
that, by creating their own IDP-rich microenvironments, stimulate critical
biological functions. IDP phase behaviors are governed by their amino acid
sequences. To make progress in understanding this sequence-phase relationship,
we report further advances in a recently introduced application of
random-phase-approximation (RPA) heteropolymer theory to account for
sequence-specific electrostatics in IDP phase separation. Here we examine
computed variations in phase behavior with respect to block length and charge
density of model polyampholytes of alternating equal-length charge blocks to
gain insight into trends observed in IDP phase separation. As a real-life
example, the theory is applied to rationalize/predict binodal and spinodal
phase behaviors of the 236-residue N-terminal disordered region of RNA helicase
Ddx4 and its charge-scrambled mutant for which experimental data are available.
Fundamental differences are noted between the phase diagrams predicted by RPA
and those predicted by mean-field Flory-Huggins and
Overbeek-Voorn/Debye-H\""uckel theories. In the RPA context, a physically
plausible dependence of relative permittivity on protein concentration can
produce a cooperative effect in favor of IDP-IDP attraction and thus a
significant increased tendency to phase separate. Ramifications of these
findings for future development of IDP phase separation theory are discussed.

provide a realization of a new class of ratchet system which we call a vector
ratchet that arises due to the effect of the Magnus term on the skyrmion
dynamics. In a vector ratchet, the dc motion induced by the ac drive can be
described as a vector that can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise
relative to the substrate asymmetry direction. Up to a full $360^{\circ}$
rotation is possible for varied ac amplitudes or skyrmion densities. In
contrast to overdamped systems, in which ratchet motion is always parallel to
the substrate asymmetry direction, vector ratchets allow the ratchet motion to
be in any direction relative to the substrate asymmetry. It is also possible to
obtain a reversal in the direction of rotation of the vector ratchet,
permitting the creation of a reversible vector ratchet. We examine vector
ratchets for ac drives applied parallel or perpendicular to the substrate
asymmetry direction, and show that reverse ratchet motion can be produced by
collective effects. No reversals occur for an isolated skyrmion on an
asymmetric substrate. Since a vector ratchet can produce motion in any
direction, it could represent a new method for controlling skyrmion motion for
spintronic applications.

seismocardiography and ballistocardiography, yet distal vibrations are still
poorly understood. In this paper we develop two methods to measure aortic valve
opening (AVO) and closing (AVC) from distal vibrations. Methods: AVO and AVC
were detected for each heartbeat with accelerometers on the upper arm (A),
wrist (W), and knee (K) of 22 consenting adults following isometric exercise.
Exercise-induced changes were recorded with impedance cardiography, and
nine-beat ensemble averaging was applied. Our first method, FilterBCG, detects
peaks in distal vibrations after filtering with individually-tuned bandpass
filters while RidgeBCG uses ridge regression to estimate AVO and AVC without
peaks. Pseudocode is provided. Results: In agreement with recent studies, we
did not find peaks at AVO and AVC in distal vibrations, and the conventional
R-J interval method from the literature also correlated poorly with AVO (r2 =
0.22 A, 0.14 W, 0.12 K). Interestingly, distal vibrations filtered with
FilterBCG resembled seismocardiogram signals and yielded reliable peaks at AVO
(r2 = 0.95 A, 0.94 W, 0.77 K) and AVC (r2 = 0.92 A, 0.89 W, 0.68 K).
Conclusion: FilterBCG measures AVO and AVC accurately from arm, wrist, and knee
vibrations, and it outperforms R-J intervals and RidgeBCG. Significance: To our
knowledge, this study is the first to measure AVC accurately from distal
vibrations. Finally, AVO timing is needed to assess cardiovascular disease risk
with pulse wave velocity (PWV) and for cuff-less diastolic blood pressure
measurement via aortic pulse-transit time (PTT).

Our method is built on earlier ones used in [21,22,18]. However, instead of
utilizing the well-known lemma of Bondy and Simonovits [4] that most existing
methods do, we develop a new and very simple lemma in its place. One useful
feature of the new lemma is its adaptiveness for the hypergraph setting.
  Using this new method, we prove a conjecture of Verstra\""ete [37] that for
$r\ge 3$, every $r$-uniform hypergraph with average degree $\Omega(k^{r-1})$
contains Berge cycles of $k$ consecutive lengths. This is sharp up to the
constant factor. As a key step and a result of independent interest, we prove
that every $r$-uniform linear hypergraph with average degree at least $7r(k+1)$
contains Berge cycles of $k$ consecutive lengths.
  In both of these results, we have additional control on the lengths of the
cycles, which therefore also gives us bounds on the Tur\'an numbers of Berge
cycles (for even and odd cycles simultaneously). In relation to our main
results, we obtain further improvements on the Tur\'an numbers of Berge cycles
and the Zarankiewicz numbers of even cycles. We will also discuss some
potential further applications of our method.

Global Centroid-Moment Tensor and Preliminary Determinations of Epicenters.
These distributions are required to develop the number test for forecasts of
future seismic activity rate. A common assumption is that the numbers are
described by the Poisson distribution. In contrast to the one-parameter Poisson
distribution, the negative-binomial distribution (NBD) has two parameters. The
second parameter characterizes the clustering or over-dispersion of a process.
We investigate the dependence of parameters for both distributions on the
catalog magnitude threshold and on temporal subdivision of catalog duration. We
find that for most cases of interest the Poisson distribution can be rejected
statistically at a high significance level in favor of the NBD. Therefore we
investigate whether these distributions fit the observed distributions of
seismicity. For this purpose we study upper statistical moments of earthquake
numbers (skewness and kurtosis) and compare them to the theoretical values for
both distributions. Empirical values for the skewness and the kurtosis increase
for the smaller magnitude threshold and increase with even greater intensity
for small temporal subdivision of catalogs. A calculation of the NBD skewness
and kurtosis levels shows rapid increase of these upper moments levels.
However, the observed catalog values of skewness and kurtosis are rising even
faster. This means that for small time intervals the earthquake number
distribution is even more heavy-tailed than the NBD predicts. Therefore for
small time intervals we propose using empirical number distributions
appropriately smoothed for testing forecasted earthquake numbers.

(Latham 1) to determine if they may be chemically related. These stars appear
to be both spatially and kinematically related, but no spectroscopic abundance
analysis exists in literature. Abundances for eight elements were derived via
equivalent width analyses of high resolution (R $\sim$60,000), high
signal-to-noise ratio ($\langle$SNR$\rangle\sim$100) spectra obtained with the
Otto Struve 2.1m telescope and Sandiford Echelle Spectrograph at McDonald
Observatory. The large star-to-star scatter in metallicity, -0.55 $\leq$ [Fe/H]
$\leq$ 0.06 dex ($\sigma$= 0.25), implies these stars were not produced from
the same chemically homogeneous molecular cloud, and are therefore not part of
a remnant or open cluster as previously proposed. Prior to this analysis, it
was suggested that two stars in the group, W11449 & W11450, are possible wide
binaries. The candidate wide binary pair show similar chemical abundance
patterns with not only iron, but with other elements analyzed in this study,
suggesting the proposed connection between these two stars may be real.

applications in multiple domains. Low delays enable improved information flow

the propagation capabilities of individual nodes and adding additional edges in
the network. One of the main challenges in such design problems is that the

an additional $U(1)$ 2-form gauge field $B$ coming from the string theory
Kalb-Ramond field. This $U(N)+B$ theory has generalized field configurations,
labeled by the $\mathbb{Z}$-valued generalized electric flux and an independent
$\mathbb{Z}_N$-valued 't Hooft flux. We argue that in the quantum mechanical
theory, the $(M,N)$-string sector with $M$ units of electric flux has a
$\mathbb{Z}_N$-valued discrete $\theta$ angle specified by $M \pmod{N}$ dual to
the 't Hooft flux. Adding the brane center-of-mass degrees of freedom to the

sector with $M$ bound F-strings is described by the $\mathcal{N}=(8,8)$ sigma
model into ${\rm Sym}^{D} ( \mathbb{R}^8)$. We provide strong evidence for
these claims by computing an $\mathcal{N}=(8,8)$ analog of the elliptic genus
of the UV gauge theories and of their conjectured IR limit sigma models, and
showing they agree. Agreement is established by noting that the elliptic genera
are modular-invariant Abelian (multi-periodic and meromorphic) functions, which
turns out to be very restrictive.

sketching) of high-dimensional data has emerged as a task of paramount
importance. Relevant issues to address in this context include the sheer volume
of data that may consist of categorical samples, the typically streaming format
of acquisition, and the possibly missing entries. To cope with these
challenges, the present paper develops a novel categorical subspace learning
approach to unravel the latent structure for three prominent categorical
(bilinear) models, namely, Probit, Tobit, and Logit. The deterministic Probit
and Tobit models treat data as quantized values of an analog-valued process
lying in a low-dimensional subspace, while the probabilistic Logit model relies
on low dimensionality of the data log-likelihood ratios. Leveraging the low
intrinsic dimensionality of the sought models, a rank regularized
maximum-likelihood estimator is devised, which is then solved recursively via
alternating majorization-minimization to sketch high-dimensional categorical
data `on the fly.' The resultant procedure alternates between sketching the new
incomplete datum and refining the latent subspace, leading to lightweight
first-order algorithms with highly parallelizable tasks per iteration. As an
extra degree of freedom, the quantization thresholds are also learned jointly
along with the subspace to enhance the predictive power of the sought models.
Performance of the subspace iterates is analyzed for both infinite and finite
data streams, where for the former asymptotic convergence to the stationary
point set of the batch estimator is established, while for the latter sublinear
regret bounds are derived for the empirical cost. Simulated tests with both
synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the merits of the novel schemes
for real-time movie recommendation and chess-game classification.

coexistence region in $P-v$ diagrams. The two-phase equilibrium curves in $P-T$

Clapeyron equation is derived for higher dimensional charged topological black

investigated. We also study the effect of the parameters of the black hole on
the region of two-phases coexistence. The results show that the black hole may
go through a small-large phase transition similar to those of usual non-gravity

growth rate of large-scale structure and its scale dependence. However,
individual peculiar velocity surveys suffer from large statistical errors due
to the intrinsic scatter in the relations used to infer a galaxy's true
distance. In this context we use a Fisher Matrix formalism to investigate the
statistical benefits of combining multiple peculiar velocity surveys. We find
that for all cases we consider there is a marked improvement on constraints on
the linear growth rate $f\sigma_{8}$. For example, the constraining power of
only a few peculiar velocity measurements is such that the addition of the
2MASS Tully-Fisher survey (containing only $\sim2,000$ galaxies) to the full
redshift and peculiar velocity samples of the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey
(containing $\sim 110,000$ redshifts and $\sim 9,000$ velocities) can improve
growth rate constraints by $\sim20\%$. Furthermore, the combination of the
future TAIPAN and WALLABY+WNSHS surveys has the potential to reach a $\sim3\%$
error on $f\sigma_{8}$, which will place tight limits on possible extensions to
General Relativity. We then turn to look at potential systematics in growth
rate measurements that can arise due to incorrect calibration of the peculiar
velocity zero-point and from scale-dependent spatial and velocity bias. For
next generation surveys, we find that neglecting velocity bias in particular
has the potential to bias constraints on the growth rate by over $5\sigma$, but
that an offset in the zero-point has negligible impact on the velocity power
spectrum.

stationary optimal policies for Markov Decision Processes with average costs
per unit time, and these inequalities hold under broad natural conditions. This
paper provides sufficient conditions for the validity of the average-cost
optimality equation for an infinite state problem with weakly continuous
transition probabilities and with possibly unbounded one-step costs and
noncompact action sets. These conditions also imply the convergence of
sequences of discounted relative value functions to average-cost relative value
functions and the continuity of average-cost relative value functions. As shown
in the paper, the classic periodic-review inventory control problem satisfies
these conditions. Therefore, the optimality inequality holds in the form of an
equality with a continuous average-cost relative value function for this
problem. In addition, the $K$-convexity of discounted relative value functions
and their convergence to average-cost relative value functions, when the
discount factor increases to 1, imply the $K$-convexity of average-cost
relative value functions. This implies that average-cost optimal $(s,S)$

optimality equation.

problems is known to be closely linked to the the composition factors of the
permutation group involved. Previous works are primarily concerned with
applying color isomorphism to bou nded degree graph isomorphism, and have
therefore focused on the alternating composit ion factors, since those are the
bottleneck in the case of graph isomorphism.
  We consider the color isomorphism problem with composition factors restricted
to those other than the alternating group, show that group isomorphism reduces
in n^(O(log log n)) time to this problem, and, conversely, that a special case
of this color isomorphism problem reduces to a slight generalization of group
isomorphism. We then sharpen our results by identifying the projective special
linear group as the main obstacle to faster algorithms for group isomorphism
and prove that the aforementioned reduc tion from group isomorphism to color
isomorphism in fact produces only cyclic and projective special linear factors.
Our results demonstrate that, just as the alternatin g group was a barrier to
faster algorithms for graph isomorphism for three decades, the projective
special linear group is an obstacle to faster algorithms for group isomorphism.

proportional to the parameter of the regularization. We use this result to
compute upper bounds on the sub-gradients of the Lagrangian function. For the
deterministic algorithm, we prove a convergence rate for attaining the optimal
objective value. In the stochastic optimization case, we similarly prove
convergence rates both in the expectation and with a high probability, using
the method of bounded martingale difference. For both algorithms, we
demonstrate a trade-off between the convergence rate and the decay rate of the
constraint violation, in the sense that improving the convergence rate slows
the decay rate of the constraint violation and vice versa. We demonstrate the
convergence of our proposed algorithms numerically for distributed regression
with the hinge and logistic loss functions over different graph structures.

exploits the similarity information among users and items and intrinsic

a new representation which preserves affinity and structure information in the
user-item rating matrix and then performs recommendation task. To capture
proximity information about users and items, two graphs are constructed.
Manifold learning idea is used to constrain the new representation to be smooth
on these graphs, so as to enforce users and item proximities. Our model is
formulated as a convex optimization problem, for which we need to solve the
well-known Sylvester equation only. We carry out extensive empirical

associated with a set of its attributes and it is critical to not only consider
the link structure of a graph but also use the attribute information to achieve
more meaningful results in various graph mining tasks. Most previous works with
attributed graphs take into ac- count attribute relationships only between

out which sets of attributes are associated with each other and whether they

reduces the movement of individual mesh vertices caused by noise during online

renormalizability). Second, we show how to systematically include
post-Newtonian corrections to the radiation reaction force. By avoiding orbit
averaging we gain predictive power and eliminate ambiguities in the initial

analytic solutions to the spin equations of motion that are valid over long

Specifically, the users are capable of harvesting and transferring energy to

supplies. Meanwhile, network coding for the users' messages is conducted at the
relays to enable cooperative transmission with source nodes in independent but
not necessarily identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) Nakagami-$m$ fading
channels. Therefore, a simultaneous two level cooperation, i.e.,
information-level and energy-level cooperation is conducted. The problem of
energy efficiency (EE) maximization under constraints of the energy causality
and a predefined outage probability threshold is formulated and shown to be
non-convex. By exploiting fractional and geometric programming, a convex
form-based iterative algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently.
Close-to-optimal power allocation and energy cooperation policies across
consecutive transmissions are found. Moreover, the effects of relay locations
and wireless energy transmission efficiency are investigated and the
performance comparison with the current state of solutions demonstrates that
the proposed policies can manage the harvested energy more efficiently.

most difficult challenges in computational structural biology. RNA tetraloops
are fundamental RNA motifs playing key roles in RNA folding and RNA-RNA and
RNA-protein interactions. Although state-of-the-art Molecular Dynamics (MD)
force fields correctly describe the native state of these tetraloops as a
stable free-energy basin on the microsecond time scale, enhanced sampling
techniques reveal that the native state is not the global free energy minimum,
suggesting yet unidentified significant imbalances in the force fields. Here,
we tested our ability to fold the RNA tetraloops in various force fields and
simulation settings. We employed three different enhanced sampling techniques,
namely, temperature replica exchange MD (T-REMD), replica exchange with solute
tempering (REST2), and well-tempered metadynamics (WT-MetaD). We aimed to
separate problems caused by limited sampling from those due to force-field
inaccuracies. We found that none of the contemporary force fields is able to
correctly describe folding of the 5'-GAGA-3' tetraloop over a range of
simulation conditions. We thus aimed to identify which terms of the force field
are responsible for this poor description of TL folding. We showed that at
least two different imbalances contribute to this behavior, namely,
overstabilization of base-phosphate and/or sugar-phosphate interactions and
underestimated stability of the hydrogen bonding interaction in base pairing.
The first artifact stabilizes the unfolded ensemble, while the second one
destabilizes the folded state. The former problem might be partially alleviated
by reparametrization of the van der Waals parameters of the phosphate oxygens
suggested by Case et al., while in order to overcome the latter effect we
suggest local potentials to better capture hydrogen bonding interactions.

the Compressive Sensing (CS) systems when applied to the signals that are not
exactly sparse. The optimal projection matrix is obtained by mainly minimizing
the average coherence of the equivalent dictionary. In order to drop the
requirement of the sparse representation error (SRE) for a set of training data
as in [15] [16], we introduce a novel penalty function independent of a
particular SRE matrix. Without requiring of training data, we can efficiently
design the robust projection matrix and apply it for most of CS systems, like a
CS system for image processing with a conventional wavelet dictionary in which
the SRE matrix is generally not available. Simulation results demonstrate the
efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with the
state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate with
natural images that under similar compression rate, a CS system with a learned
dictionary in high dimensions outperforms the one in low dimensions in terms of
reconstruction accuracy. This together with the fact that our proposed method
can efficiently work in high dimension suggests that a CS system can be
potentially implemented beyond the small patches in sparsity-based image
processing.

  classification of diseases","16 pages, 8 figures",,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Is cancer a disease that can be cured or a degenerative disease which comes
predominantly with old age? We give an answer based on a two-dimensional
representation of diseases. These two dimensions are defined as follows. In
mortality curves there is an age, namely a_c = 10 years, which plays a crucial
role in the sense that the mortality rate decreases in the interval I1=(a<a_c)
and increases in the interval I2=(a>a_c). The respective trends in I1 and I2
are the two parameters used in our classification of diseases. Within the
framework of reliability analysis, I1 and I2 would be referred to as the
""burn-in"" and ""wear-out"" phases. This leads to define three broad groups of
diseases. (AS1) Asymmetry with prevalence of I1. (AS2) Asymmetry with
prevalence of I2. (S) Symmetry, with I1 and I2 both playing roles of comparable
importance. Not surprisingly, among AS1-cases one finds all diseases due to
congenital malformations. In the AS2-class one finds degenerative diseases,
e.g. Alzheimer's disease. Among S-cases one finds most diseases due to external
pathogens or to wear-out processes. Cancer is one of those mixed cases and it
is closer to (AS2) than to (AS1). This representation also explains what we
call an OVERKILL EFFECT in old age. It tells us that even an effective cancer
therapy would have no influence whatsoever on the extent of human life unless
ALL other diseases are cured simultaneously. We conclude that whilst one might
develop a cure for many of the known diseases of old age, new diseases will
arise and the quest for the ultimate cure will be never ending. Death before
the age of 120 seems firmly written in our genetic code and the best we shall
be able to do is to help people cope with the inevitability of death as and
when it arises.

Multi-view data are usually unlabeled and come from high-dimensional spaces

crucial to many applications. However, it is nontrivial due to the following
challenges. First, there are too many instances or the feature dimensionality
is too large. Thus, the data may not fit in memory. How to select useful
features with limited memory space? Second, how to select features from
streaming data and handles the concept drift? Third, how to leverage the
consistent and complementary information from different views to improve the
feature selection in the situation when the data are too big or come in as
streams? To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous works can solve all
the challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an Online unsupervised
Multi-View Feature Selection, OMVFS, which deals with large-scale/streaming
multi-view data in an online fashion. OMVFS embeds unsupervised feature
selection into a clustering algorithm via NMF with sparse learning. It further
incorporates the graph regularization to preserve the local structure
information and help select discriminative features. Instead of storing all the
historical data, OMVFS processes the multi-view data chunk by chunk and
aggregates all the necessary information into several small matrices. By using
the buffering technique, the proposed OMVFS can reduce the computational and
storage cost while taking advantage of the structure information. Furthermore,
OMVFS can capture the concept drifts in the data streams. Extensive experiments
on four real-world datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed OMVFS method. More importantly, OMVFS is about 100 times faster than
the off-line methods.

candidate for a short-period (4.3173 d) rare WR + compact object binary.
Provided with new high resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra from the Keck
observatory, we determine the orbital parameters for both the primary WR and
the secondary, yielding respective projected orbital velocity amplitudes of
$88.1\pm3.8$ km s$^{-1}$ and $79.2\pm3.1$ km s$^{-1}$ and implying a mass ratio
of $1.1\pm0.1$. We then apply the shift-and-add technique to disentangle the
spectra and obtain spectra compatible with a WN7ha and an O4-6 star.
Considering an orbital inclination of $\sim67^\circ$, derived from previous
polarimetry observations, the system's total mass would be a mere 2-3
M$_{\odot}$ , an unprecedented result for a putative massive binary system.
However, a system comprising a 37 M$_{\odot}$ secondary (typical mass of an O5V
star) and a 33 M$_{\odot}$ primary (given the mass ratio) would infer an
inclination of $\sim18^\circ$. We therefore reconsider the previous methods of
deriving the orbital inclination based on time-dependent polarimetry and
photometry. While the polarimetric results are inconclusive requiring better
data, the photometric results favour low inclinations. Finally, we compute WR
148's space velocity and retrace the runaway's trajectory back to the Galactic
plane (GP). With an ejection velocity of $198\pm27$ km s$^{-1}$ and a travel
time of $4.7\pm0.8$ Myr to reach its current location, WR 148 was most likely
ejected via dynamical interactions in a young cluster.

the mechanism of such late-time flares based on the internal origin assumption.
In the hyper-accreting black hole (BH) scenario, we study the possibility of
two well-known mechanisms as the central engine to power such X-ray flares,
i.e., the neutrino-antineutrino annihilation and the Blandford-Znajek (BZ)
process. Our results show that the annihilation luminosity is far below the
observational data. Thus, the annihilation mechanism cannot account for such
late-time flares. For the BZ process, if the role of outflows is taken into
consideration, the inflow mass rate near the horizon will be quite low such
that the magnetic field will probably be too weak to power the observed X-ray
flares. We therefore argue that, for the late-time flares with internal origin,
the central engine is unlikely to be associated with BHs. On the contrary, a
fast rotating neutron star with strong bipolar magnetic fields may be
responsible for such flares.

technique, we study the $N\to\infty$ limit with $N_1/N$ fixed. We show that the
constraint that $\tilde{L}=\sum_{i=1}^{N_1}f(\lambda_i)$ is fixed drives an
infinite order phase transition in the underlying Coulomb gas. This transition
corresponds to a change in the density of the gas, from a density defined on
two disjoint intervals to a single interval. In this latter case the density
presents a logarithmic divergence inside the bulk. Assuming that $f(\lambda)$
is monotonous, we show that these features arise for any random matrix ensemble
and truncated linear statitics, which makes the scenario described here robust
and universal.

that is the adjoint of the slowing-down equation that is well-known in nuclear
reactor physics. A general closed-form analytical solution to such adjoint
equation is obtained by a procedure that can be used also to derive the

done by introducing appropriate kernels describing the transfer of the

conformational changes observed during biomolecular interactions proceed
through conformational selection (of preexisting isoforms) or induced fit
(ligand-induced 3D reshaping). The latter mechanism had been invoked in certain
circumstances, for example to explain the non-Michaelian activity of monomeric
enzymes like glucokinase. But the relative importance of induced fit has been
recently depreciated in favor of conformational selection, assumed to be always
sufficient, predominant in general and in particular for glucokinase. The
relative contributions of conformational selection and induced fit are
reconsidered here in and out of equilibrium, in the light of earlier concepts
such as the cyclic equilibrium rule and the turning wheel of Wyman, using
single molecule state probability, one way fluxes and net fluxes. The
conditions for a switch from conformational selection to induced fit at a given
ligand concentration are explicitly determined. Out of equilibrium, the
inspection of the enzyme states circuit shows that conformational selection
alone would give a Michaelian reaction rate but not the established nonlinear

inconsistent with their distribution in Sa-Sm hosts, which is probably due to
the contribution of the outer bulge SNe Ia in S0-S0/a galaxies. The radial
distributions of both types of SNe are similar in all the subsamples of Sa-Sbc

inputs in various physical and biological systems. However, due to finite
signal transmission speeds and differences in the distance to the source, time
shifts between otherwise common inputs are unavoidable. Since common inputs can
be a source of correlation between the elements of multi-unit dynamical
systems, regardless of whether these elements are directly connected with one
another or not, it is of importance to understand their impact on
synchronization. As a canonical model that is representative for a variety of
different dynamical systems, we study limit-cycle oscillators that are driven
by stochastic time-shifted common inputs. We show that if the oscillators are
coupled, time shifts in stochastic common inputs do not simply shift the
distribution of the phase differences, but rather the distribution actually
changes as a result. The best synchronization is therefore achieved at a
precise intermediate value of the time shift, which is due to a resonance-like
effect with the most probable phase difference that is determined by the
deterministic dynamics.

$\Psi_T(z)=\|(T-z)^{-1}\|^{-1}$ determine the so-called pseudospectra of $T$.
We set $\Psi_T$ to be zero on the spectrum of $T$. After giving some elementary
properties of $\Psi_T$ (which, as it seems, were not noticed before), we apply
them to the study of the approximation. We prove that for any operator $T$,
there is a sequence $\{T_n\}$ of finite matrices such that $\Psi_{T_n}(z)$
tends to $\Psi_{T}(z)$ uniformly on $\C$. In this proof, quasitriangular
operators play a special role. This is merely an existence result, we do not
give a concrete construction of this sequence of matrices.
  One of our main points is to show how to use infinite-dimensional operator
models in order to produce examples and counterexamples in the set of finite
matrices of large order. In particular, we get a result, which means, in a
sense, that the pseudospectrum of a nilpotent matrix can be anything one can
imagine. We also study the norms of the multipliers in the context of
Cowen--Douglas class operators. We use these results to show that, to the
opposite to the function $\Psi_{S}$, the function $\|\sqrt{S-z}\,\|$ for
certain finite matrices $S$ may oscillate arbitrarily fast even far away from
the spectrum.

Descent (ASGD) is widely adopted to fulfill this task for its efficiency, which

when a local worker adds its gradient to the global model, the global model may
have been updated by other workers and this gradient becomes ""delayed"". We
propose a novel technology to compensate this delay, so as to make the
optimization behavior of ASGD closer to that of sequential SGD. This is
achieved by leveraging Taylor expansion of the gradient function and efficient
approximation to the Hessian matrix of the loss function. We call the new
algorithm Delay Compensated ASGD (DC-ASGD). We evaluated the proposed algorithm
on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate
that DC-ASGD outperforms both synchronous SGD and asynchronous SGD, and nearly
approaches the performance of sequential SGD.

called radio relics. Radio relics are the consequence of merger-induced shocks
that propagate in the intra cluster medium (ICM). In this paper we analyse the
radio, optical and X-ray data from a candidate galaxy cluster that has been
selected from the radio emission coming from a candidate radio relic detected
in NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). Our aim is to clarify the nature of this source
and prove that under certain conditions radio emission from radio relics can be
used to trace relatively low-mass galaxy clusters. We have observed the
candidate galaxy cluster with the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at
three different frequencies. These datasets have been analysed together with
archival data from ROSAT in the X-ray and with archival data from the Gamma-Ray
Burst Optical/Near-Infrared Detector (GROND) telescope in four different
optical bands. We confirm the presence of a 1 Mpc long radio relic located in
the outskirts of a previously unknown galaxy cluster. We confirm the presence
of the galaxy cluster through dedicated optical observations and using archival
X-ray data. Due to its proximity and similar redshift to a known Abell cluster,
we named it: Abell 3527-bis. The galaxy cluster is among the least massive
cluster known to host a radio relic. We showed that radio relics can be
effectively used to trace a subset of relatively low-mass galaxy clusters that
might have gone undetected in X-ray or Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) surveys. This
technique might be used in future deep, low-frequency surveys as those carried
on by LOFAR, uGMRT and, ultimately, SKA.

low-metallicity gas of the Small Magellanic Cloud, which was at the level of

has primordial origin, but there is always some post-BBN (Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis) contamination, since lithium can also be produced in
cosmic-ray interactions with the interstellar medium. Using the fact that
processes involving cosmic rays produce lithium, but also gamma rays through
neutral pion decay, we use the Small Magellanic Cloud gamma-ray observations by
Fermi-LAT to make predictions on the amount of lithium in this galaxy that was
produced by galactic cosmic rays accelerated in supernova remnants. By
including both fusion processes, as well as spallation of heavier nuclei, we
find that galactic cosmic rays could produce a very small amount of lithium. In
the case of 6Li isotope (which should only be produced by cosmic rays) we can
only explain 0.16% of the measured abundance. If these cosmic rays are indeed
responsible for such small lithium production, observed abundances could be the
result of some other sources, which are discussed in the paper.

Therefore, searches for long-lived particles require a very different search

reconstructed itself and not only via its decay products. A very specific
characteristic of such new heavy charged particles is their large ionization

advantage of coarse-grained locking on modern hardware, avoid the run-time and

velocity and diverging density of states (DOS) near band edges. However, in
practice, systems have finite sizes and inevitably this prompts the question of
whether helpful physical quantities related to infinite systems, such as the
group velocity that is deduced from the band structure, remain relevant in
finite systems. For instance, one may wonder how the DOS divergence can be
approached with finite systems. Intuitively, one may expect that the
implementation of larger and larger DOS, or equivalently smaller and smaller
group velocities, would critically increase the system length. Based on general
1D-wave-physics arguments, we demonstrate that the large slow-light DOS
enhancement of periodic systems can be observed with very short systems, whose
lengths scale with the logarithm of the inverse of the group velocities. The
understanding obtained for 1D systems leads us to propose a novel sort of
microstructure to enhance light-matter interaction, a sort of photonic speed
bump that abruptly changes the speed of light by a few orders of magnitude
without any reflection. We show that the DOS enhancements of speed bumps result
from a classical electromagnetic resonance characterized by a single resonance

non-backtracking random walks on finite Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks of $N$
nodes. The walkers hop randomly between adjacent nodes on the network, without
stepping back to the previous node, until they hit a node which they have
already visited before or get trapped in a dead-end node. At this point, the
path is terminated. The length, $d$, of the resulting path, is called the first
hitting time. Using recursion equations, we obtain analytical results for the
tail distribution of first hitting times, $P(d>\ell)$, $\ell=0,1,2,\dots$, of
non-backtracking random walks starting from a random initial node. It turns out
that the distribution $P(d>\ell)$ is given by a product of a discrete Rayleigh
distribution and an exponential distribution. It is found that the paths of
non-backtracking random walks, up to their termination at the first hitting
time, are longer, on average, than those of the corresponding simple RWs.
However, they are shorter than those of SAWs on the same network, which
terminate at the last hitting time. We obtain analytical results for the
probabilities, $p_{\rm ret}$ and $p_{\rm trap}$, that a path will terminate by
retracing, namely stepping into an already visited node, or by trapping, namely
entering a node of degree $k=1$, which has no exit link, respectively. It is
shown that in dilute networks the dominant termination scenario is trapping
while in dense networks most paths terminate by retracing. We obtain
expressions for the conditional tail distributions of path lengths,
$P(d>\ell|{\rm ret})$ and $P(d>\ell|\rm{trap})$, for those paths which
terminate by retracing or by trapping, respectively. We also study a class of
generalized non-backtracking random walk models which not only avoid the
backtracking step into the previous node but avoid stepping into the last $S$
visited nodes.

use explicit Coulomb positive and negative charges at the tip of polymer-arms
of our bead-spring model of star polymers. By our simulations we show that the
dipoles at the tip of star arms aggregate together to form clusters of dipoles.
Each cluster has contribution from several stars, and in turn each star
contributes to several clusters. Thus the entire polymer melt forms a connected
network. Network forming tendencies decrease with decrease of the value of the
effective charge constituting the dipole: this can be experimentally realized
by choosing a different ionomer for the star tip. We systematically varied the
value of dipole charges, the fraction of star-arms with dipoles at the tip and
the length of the arms. The choice of explicit charges in our calculations
enables us to make better quantitative predictions about the onset of gelation,
moreover we get qualitatively distinct results about structural organization of
dipoles within a dipole-cluster.

different contexts. To model this structure we begin with a single-layer
weighted social network (WSN) model showing the Granovetterian structure. We
find that when merging such WSN models, a sufficient amount of inter-layer
correlation is needed to maintain the relationship between topology and link
weights, while these correlations destroy the enhancement in the community
overlap due to multiple layers. To resolve this, we devise a geographic
multi-layer WSN model, where the indirect inter-layer correlations due to the
geographic constraints of individuals enhance the overlaps between the
communities and, at the same time, the Granovetterian structure is preserved.
Furthermore, the network of social interactions can be considered as a
multiplex from another point of view too: each layer corresponds to one
communication channel and the aggregate of all them constitutes the entire
social network. However, usually one has information only about one of the
channels, which should be considered as a sample of the whole. Here we show by
simulations and analytical methods that this sampling may lead to bias. For
example, while it is expected that the degree distribution of the whole social
network has a maximum at a value larger than one, we get with reasonable
assumptions about the sampling process a monotonously decreasing distribution
as observed in empirical studies of single channel data. We analyse the
far-reaching consequences of our findings.

Minimization (R-ERM), and solved by optimization algorithms such as gradient
descent (GD), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and stochastic variance
reduction (SVRG). Conventional analysis on these optimization algorithms
focuses on their convergence rates during the training process, however, people
in the machine learning community may care more about the generalization
performance of the learned model on unseen test data. In this paper, we
investigate on this issue, by using stability as a tool. In particular, we
decompose the generalization error for R-ERM, and derive its upper bound for
both convex and non-convex cases. In convex cases, we prove that the
generalization error can be bounded by the convergence rate of the optimization
algorithm and the stability of the R-ERM process, both in expectation (in the
order of $\mathcal{O}((1/n)+\mathbb{E}\rho(T))$, where $\rho(T)$ is the
convergence error and $T$ is the number of iterations) and in high probability
(in the order of
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log{1/\delta}}{\sqrt{n}}+\rho(T)\right)$ with
probability $1-\delta$). For non-convex cases, we can also obtain a similar
expected generalization error bound. Our theorems indicate that 1) along with
the training process, the generalization error will decrease for all the
optimization algorithms under our investigation; 2) Comparatively speaking,
SVRG has better generalization ability than GD and SGD. We have conducted
experiments on both convex and non-convex problems, and the experimental
results verify our theoretical findings.

measures are also very related to classic notions like diameter and radius.
Roditty and Vassilevska Williams~[STOC'13] showed that no algorithm can compute
a (3/2-\delta)-approximation of the diameter in sparse and unweighted graphs
faster that n^{2-o(1)} time unless the widely believed strong exponential time
hypothesis (SETH) is false. Abboud et al.~[SODA'15] and [SODA'16] further
analyzed these problems under the recent line of research on hardness in P.
They showed that in sparse and unweighted graphs (weighted for BC) none of
these problems can be solved faster than n^{2-o(1)} unless some popular
conjecture is false. Furthermore they ruled out a (2-\delta)-approximation for
RC, a (3/2-\delta)-approximation for Radius and a (5/3-\delta)-approximation
for computing all eccentricities of a graph for any \delta > 0. We extend these
results to the case of unweighted graphs with constant maximum degree. Through
new graph constructions we are able to obtain the same approximation and time
bounds as for sparse graphs even in unweighted bounded-degree graphs. We show
that no (3/2-\delta) approximation of Radius or Diameter,
(2-\delta)-approximation of RC, (5/3-\delta)-approximation of all
eccentricities or exact algorithm for BC exists in time n^{2-o(1)} for such

to take a universal form. It depends on a singleparameter, the system length
expressed in a rescaled metrics, which encapsulates all the microscopicfeatures
of the medium and the bias field. Excellent agreement with numerics is found
for variousmodels of disorder and bias field. For white-noise disorder and a
linear bias field, we demonstratethe algebraic nature of the decay of the
transmission with distance, irrespective of the value ofthe bias field. It
contrasts with the expansion of a wave packet, which features a

the different boundary conditionsfor the transmission and expansion schemes.

steady-state, thanks to their radiative coupling by mutual interaction through
the normal modes of a photonic crystal dimer. We employ a quantum master
equation formalism to quantify the steady-state entanglement by calculating the
system {\it negativity}. Calculations are specified to consider realistic
semiconductor nanostructure parameters for the photonic crystal dimer-quantum
dots coupled system, determined by a guided mode expansion solution of Maxwell
equations. Negativity values of the order of 0.1 ($20\%$ of the maximum value)
are shown for interdot distances that are larger than the resonant wavelength
of the system. It is shown that the amount of entanglement is almost
independent of the interdot distance, as long as the normal mode splitting of
the photonic dimer is larger than their linewidths, which becomes the only
requirement to achieve a local and individual qubit addressing. Considering
inhomogeneously broadened quantum dots, we find that the steady-state
entanglement is preserved as long as the detuning between the two quantum dot
resonances is small when compared to their decay rates. The steady-state
entanglement is shown to be robust against the effects of pure dephasing of the
quantum dot transitions. We finally study the entanglement dynamics for a

ways: Either a massive star collapses directly into a BH without a supernova
(SN) explosion, or an explosion occurs in a proto-neutron star, but the energy
is too low to completely unbind the stellar envelope, and a large fraction of
it falls back onto the short-lived neutron star (NS), leading to the delayed
formation of a BH. Theoretical models set progenitor masses for BH formation by
implosion, namely, by complete or almost complete collapse, but observational
evidences have been elusive. Here are reviewed the observational insights on
BHs formed by implosion without large natal kicks from: (1) the kinematics in
three dimensions of space of five Galactic BH X-ray binaries (BH-XRBs), (2) the
diversity of optical and infrared observations of massive stars that collapse
in the dark, with no luminous SN explosions, possibly leading to the formation
of BHs, and (3) the sources of gravitational waves produced by mergers of
stellar BHs so far detected with LIGO. Multiple indications of BH formation
without ejection of a significant amount of matter and with no natal kicks
obtained from these different areas of observational astrophysics, and the
recent observational confirmation of the expected dependence of BH formation on
metallicity and redshift, are qualitatively consistent with the high merger
rates of binary black holes (BBHs) inferred from the first detections with

the growth of magnetic multilayer systems with large interfacial chiral
interaction, the determination of the amplitude of the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya
interactions (DMi), the detailed structural and magnetic characterization of
interfaces, the magnetic imaging of individual skyrmions and the thermal
stability and interaction of skyrmions with intrinsic and/or artificial

forms the basis for all the planned subsequent material optimization,
electrical transport experiments and devices preparation in the MAGicSky
research program. In particular, imaging is paramount as a technique since it
enables us to unequivocally demonstrate chiral magnetic skyrmions by directly
imaging i) the effects of engineering multilayer samples with large DMis and
ii) the skyrmionic structure and properties. In order to get complementary
physical insight on the properties of magnetic skyrmions and to corroborate our
research results, we utilise a plethora of key state-of-the-art advanced
magnetic imaging techniques, namely: i) Spin-polarised Scanning Tunnelling
Microscopy (SP-STM), Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) Lorentz
Transmission Electron Microscopy (Lorentz TEM) as well as, Magnetic Force

For the conventional GMM-UBM architecture, the decision is usually conducted

be sensitive to the complex variations in speech signals (e.g. text content,

encryption schemes is investigated from both design and cryptanalytic
perspective. Two novel algorithms towards an optimal selection of tap positions
are given which can be satisfactorily used to provide (sub)optimal resistance
to some generic cryptanalytic techniques applicable to these schemes. It is
demonstrated that certain real-life ciphers (e.g. SOBER-t32, SFINKS and
Grain-128), employing some standard criteria for tap selection such as the
concept of full difference set, are not fully optimized with respect to these
attacks. These standard design criteria are quite insufficient and the proposed
algorithms appear to be the only generic method for the purpose of (sub)optimal
selection of tap positions. We also extend the framework of a generic
cryptanalytic method called Generalized Filter State Guessing Attacks (GFSGA),
introduced in [26] as a generalization of the FSGA method, by applying a
variable sampling of the keystream bits in order to retrieve as much
information about the secret state bits as possible. Two different modes that
use a variable sampling of keystream blocks are presented and it is shown that
in many cases these modes may outperform the standard GFSGA mode. We also
demonstrate the possibility of employing GFSGA-like attacks to other design
strategies such as NFSR-based ciphers (Grain family for instance) and filter
generators outputting a single bit each time the cipher is clocked. In
particular, when the latter scenario is considered, the idea of combining GFSGA
technique and algebraic attacks appears to be a promising unified cryptanalytic
method against NFSR-based stream ciphers.

which subsequences should be mined. A variety of such subsequence constraints
has been studied in the literature, including length, gap, span,
regular-expression, and hierarchy constraints. In this paper, we show that many
subsequence constraints---including and beyond those considered in the
literature---can be unified in a single framework. A unified treatment allows
researchers to study jointly many types of subsequence constraints (instead of
each one individually) and helps to improve usability of pattern mining systems
for practitioners. In more detail, we propose a set of simple and intuitive
""pattern expressions"" to describe subsequence constraints and explore
algorithms for efficiently mining frequent subsequences under such general
constraints. Our algorithms translate pattern expressions to compressed finite
state transducers, which we use as computational model, and simulate these
transducers in a way suitable for frequent sequence mining. Our experimental
study on real-world datasets indicates that our algorithms---although more
general---are competitive to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

Hydrogen gas is in a quantum regime when the thermal de Broglie wavelength is
much larger than the s-wave scattering length. In this regime the identical
particle effects play major role in atomic collisions and lead to the Identical
Spin Rotation effect (ISR). We observed a variety of spin wave modes caused by
this effect with strong dependence on the magnetic potential caused by
variations of the polarizing magnetic field. We demonstrate confinement of the
ISR modes in the magnetic potential and manipulate their properties by changing
the spatial profile of magnetic field. We have found that at a high enough
density of H gas the magnons accumulate in their ground state in the magnetic
trap and exhibit long coherence, which has a profound effect on the electron
spin resonance spectra. Such macroscopic accumulation of the ground state
occurs at a certain critical density of hydrogen gas, where the chemical
potential of the magnons becomes equal to the energy of their ground state in
the trapping potential.

machine learning, since it constrains the capacity of the hypothesis space and
guarantees the generalization ability of the learning algorithm. Two classic
proximal optimization algorithms, i.e., proximal stochastic gradient descent
(ProxSGD) and proximal stochastic coordinate descent (ProxSCD) have been widely
used to solve the R-ERM problem. Recently, variance reduction technique was
proposed to improve ProxSGD and ProxSCD, and the corresponding ProxSVRG and
ProxSVRCD have better convergence rate. These proximal algorithms with variance
reduction technique have also achieved great success in applications at small
and moderate scales. However, in order to solve large-scale R-ERM problems and
make more practical impacts, the parallel version of these algorithms are
sorely needed. In this paper, we propose asynchronous ProxSVRG (Async-ProxSVRG)

Async-ProxSVRG can achieve near linear speedup when the training data is
sparse, while Async-ProxSVRCD can achieve near linear speedup regardless of the
sparse condition, as long as the number of block partitions are appropriately
set. We have conducted experiments on a regularized logistic regression task.
The results verified our theoretical findings and demonstrated the practical
efficiency of the asynchronous stochastic proximal algorithms with variance

Proponents claim it will fuel a research revolution, but skeptics challenge it

scientists need effective tools to quantify big data's measurement error and
expand the contextual information associated with it. Standard research efforts
in many fields already pursue these goals through data augmentation, the
systematic assessment of measurement against known quantities and expansion of
extant data by adding new information. Traditionally, these tasks are
accomplished using trained research assistants or specialized algorithms.
However, such approaches may not be scalable to big data or appease its
skeptics. We consider a third alternative that may increase the validity and
value of big data: data augmentation with online crowdsourcing. We present
three empirical cases to illustrate the strengths and limits of crowdsourcing
for academic research, with a particular eye to how they can be applied to data
augmentation tasks that will accelerate acceptance of big data among social
scientists. The cases use Amazon Mechanical Turk to 1. verify automated coding

processing tasks. Recently a new line of research has emerged, dealing with
nonlinear eigenfunctions induced by convex functionals. This has provided new
insights and better theoretical understanding of convex regularization and
introduced new processing methods. However, the theory of nonlinear eigenvalue
problems is still at its infancy. We present a new flow that can generate
nonlinear eigenfunctions of the form $T(u)=\lambda u$, where $T(u)$ is a
nonlinear operator and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R} $ is the eigenvalue. We develop
the theory where $T(u)$ is a subgradient element of a regularizing
one-homogeneous functional, such as total-variation (TV) or
total-generalized-variation (TGV). We introduce two flows: a forward flow and
an inverse flow; for which the steady state solution is a nonlinear
eigenfunction. The forward flow monotonically smooths the solution (with
respect to the regularizer) and simultaneously increases the $L^2$ norm. The
inverse flow has the opposite characteristics. For both flows, the steady state
depends on the initial condition, thus different initial conditions yield
different eigenfunctions. This enables a deeper investigation into the space of
nonlinear eigenfunctions, allowing to produce numerically diverse examples,
which may be unknown yet. In addition we suggest an indicator to measure the
affinity of a function to an eigenfunction and relate it to
pseudo-eigenfunctions in the linear case.

quantum networks to operate using fibre optic infrastructure. Entangled light
can be generated by quantum dots (QDs) with naturally small
fine-structure-splitting (FSS) between exciton eigenstates. Moreover, QDs can
be engineered to emit at standard telecom wavelengths. To achieve sufficient
signal intensity for applications, QDs have been incorporated into 1D optical
microcavities. However, combining these properties in a single device has so
far proved elusive. Here, we introduce a growth strategy to realise QDs with
small FSS in the conventional telecom band, and within an optical cavity. Our
approach employs droplet-epitaxy of InAs quantum dots on (001) substrates. We
show the scheme improves the symmetry of the dots by 72%. Furthermore, our
technique is universal, and produces low FSS QDs by molecular beam epitaxy on
GaAs emitting at ~900nm, and metal-organic vapour phase epitaxy on InP emitting
at 1550 nm, with mean FSS 4x smaller than for Stranski-Krastanow QDs.

controlled by the interspecies interaction $W$. To analyze the ground state

coherence visibility and the entanglement entropy as functions of $W$. Then we
approach analytically the description of the low-energy scenario by means of
the Bogoliubov scheme. In this framework the ground-state transition from
delocalized to localized species (with space separation for $W>0$, and mixing

accretion process from a disc onto a binary system. We show that energy is
dissipated at the edge of a circumbinary disc and this is associated with the
tidal torque that maintains the cavity: angular momentum is transferred from
the binary to the disc through the action of compressional shocks and viscous
friction. These shocks can be viewed as being produced by fluid elements which
drift into the cavity and, before being accreted, are accelerated onto
trajectories that send them back to impact the disc. The rate of energy
dissipation is approximately equal to the product of potential energy per unit
mass at the disc's inner edge and the accretion rate, estimated from the disc
parameters just beyond the cavity edge, that would occur without the binary.
For very thin discs, the actual accretion rate onto the binary may be
significantly less. We calculate the energy emitted by a circumbinary disc
taking into account energy dissipation at the inner edge and also irradiation
arising there from reprocessing of light from the stars. We find that, for
tight PMS binaries, the SED is dominated by emission from the inner edge at
wavelengths between 1-4 and 10 $\mu$m. This may apply to systems like CoRoT
223992193 and V1481 Ori.

and filling factor obtained using imaging and spectroscopic observations. A
differential emission measure (DEM) analysis was performed at the region of the
jet-spire and the footpoint using EIS observations and also by combining AIA
and XRT observations. The DEM curves were used to create synthetic spectra with
the CHIANTI atomic database. The plasma along the line-of-sight in the
jet-spire and jet-footpoint was found to be peak at 2.0 MK. We calculated
electron densities using the Fe XII ($\lambda$186/$\lambda$195) line ratio in
the region of the spire (Ne = 7.6x$10^{10}$ $cm^{-3}$) and the footpoint
(1.1x$10^{11}$ $cm^{-3}$). The plane-of-sky velocity of the jet is found to be
524 km/s. The resulting EIS DEM values are in good agreement with those
obtained from AIA-XRT. There is no indication of high temperatures, such as
emission from Fe XVII ($\lambda$254.87) (log T [K] = 6.75) seen in the
jet-spire. In case of the jet-footpoint, synthetic spectra predict weak
contributions from Ca XVII ($\lambda$192.85) and Fe XVII ($\lambda$254.87).
With further investigation, we confirmed emission from the Fe XVIII
($\lambda$93.932) line in the AIA 94 ${\AA}$ channel in the region of the

XVIII count rates. A study of the temporal evolution of the jet-footpoint and
the presence of high-temperature emission from the Fe XVIII (log T [K] = 6.85)
line leads us to conclude that the hot component in the jet-footpoint was
present initially that the jet had cooled down by the time EIS observed it.

the temporal share of a cell center section and that of the cell edge section
is set to a fixed desired value for all cells. The second fairness criterion is
based on the max-min temporal fairness for which the temporal share of the

validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for both criteria. The impact

power-law decaying interactions characterized by an exponent $\alpha$, which
can be experimentally realized in ion traps. We focus on two classes of
emergent dynamical critical phenomena following a quantum quench from a
ferromagnetic initial state: The first one manifests in the time averaged order
parameter, which vanishes at a critical transverse field. We argue that such a
transition occurs only for long-range interactions $\alpha \leq 2$ . The second
class corresponds to the emergence of time-periodic singularities in the return
probability to the ground state manifold (a.k.a. Loschmidt echo) which is
obtained for all values of $\alpha$ and agrees with the order parameter
transition for $\alpha\leq 2$. We characterize how the two classes of
nonequilibrium criticality correspond to each other and give a physical
interpretation based on the symmetry of the time-evolved quantum states.

wormhole} initiated in our companion paper. More precisely, we study finite
energy $\ell$--equivariant wave maps from the (1+3)-dimensional spacetime
$\mathbb R \times (\mathbb R \times \mathbb{S}^2) \rightarrow \mathbb{S}^3$
where the metric on $\mathbb R \times (\mathbb R \times \mathbb{S}^2)$ is given
by \begin{align*} ds^2 = -dt^2 + dr^2 + (r^2 + 1) \left ( d \theta^2 + \sin^2
\theta d \varphi^2 \right ), \quad t,r \in \mathbb R, (\theta,\varphi) \in
\mathbb{S}^2. \end{align*} The constant time slices are each given by a
Riemannian manifold $\mathcal M$ with two asymptotically Euclidean ends at $r =
\pm \infty$ that are connected by a 2--sphere at $r = 0$. The spacetime
$\mathbb R \times (\mathbb R \times \mathbb{S}^2)$ has appeared in the general
relativity literature as a prototype wormhole geometry (but is not expected to
exist in nature). Each $\ell$--equivariant finite energy wave map can be
indexed by its topological degree $n$. For each $\ell$ and $n$, there exists a
unique, linearly stable energy minimizing $\ell$--equivariant harmonic map
$Q_{\ell,n} : \mathcal M \rightarrow \mathbb{S}^3$ of degree $n$. In this work,
we prove the soliton resolution conjecture for this model. More precisely, we
show that modulo a free radiation term every $\ell$--equivariant wave map of
degree $n$ converges strongly to $Q_{\ell,n}$. This fully resolves a conjecture
made by Bizon and Kahl. In the companion paper, we showed this for the
corotational case $\ell = 1$ and established many preliminary results that are
used in the current work.

with time-dependent travel times and time-dependent value gain, termed Twofold
Time-Dependent AOP or 2TD-AOP for short. In its original definition, the
NP-hard Orienteering Problem (OP) asks to find a path from a source to a
destination maximizing the accumulated value while not exceeding a cost budget.
Variations of the OP and AOP have many practical applications such as mobile
crowdsourcing tasks (e.g., repairing and maintenance or dispatching field
workers), diverse logistics problems (e.g., crowd control or controlling
wildfires) as well as several tourist guidance problems (e.g., generating trip
recommendations or navigating through theme parks). In the proposed 2TD-AOP,
travel times and value functions are assumed to be time-dependent. The dynamic
values model, for instance, varying rewards in crowdsourcing tasks or varying
urgency levels in damage control tasks. We discuss this novel problem, prove
the benefit of time-dependence empirically and present an efficient
approximative solution, optimized for fast response systems. Our approach is
the first time-dependent variant of the AOP to be evaluated on a large scale,
fine-grained, real-world road network. We show that optimal solutions are
infeasible and solutions to the static problem are often invalid. We propose an
approximate dynamic programming solution which produces valid paths and is
orders of magnitude faster than any optimal solution.

Scorpius-Centaurus OB association that underwent a series of complex eclipses
over 56 days in 2007. To explain these, it was hypothesised that a secondary
substellar companion, J1407b, has a giant ring system filling a large fraction
of the Hill sphere, causing the eclipses. Observations have not successfully
detected J1407b, but do rule out circular orbits for the companion around the
primary star.
  Aims. We test to what degree the ring model of J1407b could survive in an
eccentric orbit required to fit the observations.
  Methods. We run N-body simulations under the AMUSE framework to test the
stability of Hill radius-filling systems where the companion is on an eccentric
orbit.
  Results. We strongly rule out prograde ring systems and find that a secondary
of 60 to 100MJup with an 11 year orbital period and retrograde orbiting
material can survive for at least $10^4$ orbits and produce eclipses with
similar durations as the observed one.

devices and the lion's share of energy is often spent on transceiver usage
(sending/receiving packets), not on computation. In this paper we study the
energy complexity of LeaderElection and ApproximateCounting in several models
of wireless radio networks. It turns out that energy complexity is very
sensitive to whether the devices can generate random bits and their ability to
detect collisions. We consider four collision-detection models: Strong-CD (in
which transmitters and listeners detect collisions), Sender-CD and Receiver-CD
(in which only transmitters or only listeners detect collisions), and No-CD (in
which no one detects collisions.)
  The take-away message of our results is quite surprising. For randomized
LeaderElection algorithms, there is an exponential gap between the energy
complexity of Sender-CD and Receiver-CD, and for deterministic LeaderElection
algorithms there is another exponential gap, but in the reverse direction.
  In particular, the randomized energy complexity of LeaderElection is
$\Theta(\log^* n)$ in Sender-CD but $\Theta(\log(\log^* n))$ in Receiver-CD,
where $n$ is the (unknown) number of devices. Its deterministic complexity is
$\Theta(\log N)$ in Receiver-CD but $\Theta(\log\log N)$ in Sender-CD, where
$N$ is the (known) size of the devices' ID space.
  There is a tradeoff between time and energy. We give a new upper bound on the
time-energy tradeoff curve for randomized LeaderElection and
ApproximateCounting. A critical component of this algorithm is a new
deterministic LeaderElection algorithm for dense instances, when $n=\Theta(N)$,
with inverse-Ackermann-type ($O(\alpha(N))$) energy complexity.

candidates is a valuable complementary approach to the standard search adopted
in current $\gamma$-ray Fermi-LAT catalogs. Our candidates are part of the
2WHSP sample, that was assembled with the aim of providing targets for Imaging
Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT), and is currently the largest set of
high synchrotron peaked (HSP) blazars. We perform a likelihood analysis with
the Fermi Science Tools using positions from 400 2WHSP blazars as seeds of
tentative $\gamma$-ray sources. This enabled us to detect 150 $\gamma$-ray
excess signals that have not yet been reported in previous $\gamma$-ray
catalogs (1FGL, 2FGL, and 3FGL). By identifying new sources, we solve a
fraction of the extragalactic isotropic $\gamma$-ray background (IGRB)
composition, improving the description of the $\gamma$-ray sky. Our analysis
considers the 0.3-500 GeV energy band, integrating over 7.2 yrs of Fermi-LAT
observation and making use of the Pass 8 data release. Within the 150 2WHSPs
that showed excess $\gamma$-ray signature: 85 are high-significance detections
with test statistic (TS)$>$25, and 65 are lower-significance detections with TS
between 10 to 25. We study the $\gamma$-ray photon spectral index distribution,
the likelihood of detection according to the synchrotron peak brightness, and
plot the measured $\gamma$-ray LogN-LogS of HSP blazars, also discussing the
portion of the IGRB that has been resolved by this work. We report on four
cases where we could resolve source confusion and find counterparts for
unassociated 3FGL sources with the help of high-energy TS maps together with
multi-frequency data. The 150 new $\gamma$-ray sources are named with the
acronym 1BIGB for the first version of the Brazil ICRANet Gamma-ray Blazar
catalog, in reference to the cooperation agreement supporting this work.

quality of the Hessian approximation, and compare it with a method that employs
a stochastic gradient iteration instead of the CG method. We report preliminary

the gas-dynamical effect of stellar winds on exoplanet atmospheres, three types
of gaseous envelopes can form around hot Jupiters: closed, quasi-closed, and
open. The type of envelope that forms depends on the position of the frontal
collision point (where the dynamical pressure of the wind is equal to the
pressure of the surrounding atmosphere) relative to the Roche-lobe boundaries.
Closed envelopes are formed around planets whose atmospheres lie completely
within their Roche lobes. If the frontal collision point is located outside the
Roche lobe, the atmospheric material begins to flow out through the Lagrangian
points $\mathrm{L_1}$ and $\mathrm{L_2}$, which can result in the formation of
quasi-closed (if the dynamical pressure of the stellar wind stops the outflow
through $\mathrm{L_1}$) or open gaseous envelopes. The example of the typical
hot Jupiter HD 209458 b is considered for four sets of atmospheric parameters,
to determine the mass-loss rates for the different types of envelopes arising
with these parameters. The mass-loss rates based on the modeling results were
estimated to be $\dot{M} \leq 10^{9}$ g/s for a closed atmosphere, $\dot{M}
\simeq 3 \times 10^{9}$ g/s for a quasi-closed atmosphere, and $\dot{M} \simeq
3 \times 10^{10}$ g/s for an open atmosphere. The matter in the closed and
quasi-closed atmospheres flows out mainly through $\mathrm{L_2}$, and the
matter in open envelopes primarily through $\mathrm{L_1}$.

In this system, a non-vanishing value is mandatory in the real part of the

cases of multiple Higgs doublets emerging on $T^2/Z_2$, the mass matrices of

change. Genetic consequences are not well understood but are clearly coupled to
ecological dynamics that, in turn, are driven by shifting climate conditions.
We model a population with a deterministic reaction-- diffusion model coupled
to a heterogeneous environment that develops in time due to climate change. We
decompose the resulting travelling wave solution into neutral genetic
components to analyse the spatio-temporal dynamics of its genetic structure.
Our analysis shows that range expansions and range shifts under slow climate
change preserve genetic diversity. This is because slow climate change creates
range boundaries that promote spatial mixing of genetic components.
Mathematically , the mixing leads to so-called pushed travelling wave
solutions. This mixing phenomenon is not seen in spatially homogeneous
environments, where range expansion reduces genetic diversity through gene
surfing arising from pulled travelling wave solutions. However, the
preservation of diversity is diminished when climate change occurs too quickly.
Using diversity indices, we show that fast expansions and range shifts erode
genetic diversity more than slow range expansions and range shifts. Our study
provides analytical insight into the dynamics of travelling wave solutions in
heterogeneous environments.

the static geometry of Earth to control the steady state of a dynamical

the ground based $\gamma$-ray astronomy, where Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique
(ACT) is being used. Importantly, such study gives an insight on the nature of
$\gamma$-ray and hadronic showers in general. In this work, the CORSIKA 6.990
simulation code is used for generation of EASs. Similarly to the case of
Ref.\cite{Hazarika}, this study also revealed that, the lateral density and
arrival time distributions of Cherenkov photons vary almost in accordance with
the functions: $\rho_{ch}(r) = \rho_{0}\;e^{-\beta r}$ and $t_{ch}(r) =
t_{0}e^{\Gamma/r^{\lambda}}$ respectively by taking different values of the
parameters of functions for the type, energy and zenith angle of the primary
particle. The distribution of Cherenkov photon's angular positions with respect
to shower axis shows distinctive features depending on the primary type, its
energy and the zenith angle.

apically by reversible addition of elementary building blocks. But beyond this
common principle, the modalities of fibril formation are very disparate, with
various intermediate forms which can be reshuffled by minor modifications of
physico-chemical conditions or amino-acid sequences. To bypass this complexity,
the multifaceted phenomenon of fibril formation is reduced here to its most
elementary principles defined for a linear prototype of fibril. Selected
generic features, including nucleation, elongation and conformational
recruitment, are modeled using minimalist hypotheses and tools, by separating
equilibrium from kinetic aspects and in vitro from in vivo conditions. These
reductionist approaches allow to bring out known and new rudiments, including
the kinetic and equilibrium effects of nucleation, the dual influence of
elongation on nucleation, the kinetic limitations on nucleation and fibril
numbers and the accumulation of complexes in vivo by rescue from degradation.
Overlooked aspects of these processes are also pointed: the exponential
distribution of fibril lengths can be recovered using various models because it
is attributable to randomness only. It is also suggested that the same term
""critical concentration"" is used for different things, involved in either
nucleation or elongation.

rays emanating from the Galactic Center in terms of annihilating or decaying
dark matter. These models typically exhibit a variety of complicated cascade
mechanisms for photon production, leading to a non-trivial kinematics which
obscures the physics of the underlying dark sector. In this paper, by contrast,
we observe that the spectrum of the gamma-ray excess may actually exhibit an
intriguing ""energy-duality"" invariance under $E_\gamma \rightarrow
E_\ast^2/E_\gamma$ for some $E_\ast$. As we shall discuss, such an energy
duality points back to a remarkably simple alternative kinematics which in turn
is realized naturally within the Dynamical Dark Matter framework. Observation
of this energy duality could therefore provide considerable information about
the properties of the dark sector from which the Galactic-Center gamma-ray
excess might arise, and highlights the importance of acquiring more complete
data for the Galactic-Center excess in the energy range around 1 GeV.

known as a hypernetwork, to generate the weights for another network.
Hypernetworks provide an abstraction that is similar to what is found in
nature: the relationship between a genotype - the hypernetwork - and a
phenotype - the main network. Though they are also reminiscent of HyperNEAT in
evolution, our hypernetworks are trained end-to-end with backpropagation and
thus are usually faster. The focus of this work is to make hypernetworks useful
for deep convolutional networks and long recurrent networks, where
hypernetworks can be viewed as relaxed form of weight-sharing across layers.
Our main result is that hypernetworks can generate non-shared weights for LSTM
and achieve near state-of-the-art results on a variety of sequence modelling
tasks including character-level language modelling, handwriting generation and
neural machine translation, challenging the weight-sharing paradigm for
recurrent networks. Our results also show that hypernetworks applied to
convolutional networks still achieve respectable results for image recognition
tasks compared to state-of-the-art baseline models while requiring fewer
learnable parameters.

loss of information about the state of the world across layers of the network,

algebraic condition identifies networks in which information loss occurs, and
we show that all such networks must contain a particular network motif. We also
study random networks asymptotically as the number of agents increases, and
find a sharp transition in the probability of information loss at the point at
which the number of agents in one layer exceeds the number in the previous

causing a number of nosocomial infections in hospitals. Mathematical models
have been used to study the transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria
within a hospital and the measures to control antibiotic resistance in
nosocomial pathogens. Studies presented in \cite{LBL,LB} have shown great value
in understanding the transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a
hospital. However, their results are limited to numerical simulations of a few
different scenarios without analytical analysis of the models in all
biologically feasible parameter regions. Bifurcation analysis and
identification of the global stability conditions are necessary to assess the
interventions which are proposed to limit nosocomial infection and stem the
spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In this paper we study the global
dynamics of the mathematical model of antibiotic resistance in hospitals in
\cite{LBL,LB}. The invasion reproduction number $\mathcal R_{ar}$ of
antibiotic-resistant bacteria is introduced. We give the relationship of
$\mathcal R_{ar}$ and two control reproduction numbers of sensitive bacteria
and resistant bacteria ($\mathcal R_{sc}$ and $\mathcal R_{rc}$). More
importantly, we prove that a backward bifurcation may occur at $\mathcal
R_{ar}=1$ when the model includes superinfection which is not mentioned in
\cite{LB}. That is, there exists a new threshold $\mathcal R_{ar}^c$, and if
$\mathcal R_{ar}^c<\mathcal R_{ar}<1$, then the system can have two interior
equilibria and it supports an interesting bistable phenomenon. This provides
critical information on controlling the antibiotic-resistance in a hospital.

commonly define the shift operator. The spectral decomposition of the shift
operator plays an important role in that the eigenvalues represent frequencies
and the eigenvectors provide a spectral basis. This is useful, for example, in
the design of filters. However, the graph or network may be uncertain due to
stochastic influences in construction and maintenance, and, under such
conditions, the eigenvalues of the shift matrix become random variables. This
paper examines the spectral distribution of the eigenvalues of random networks
formed by including each link of a D-dimensional lattice supergraph
independently with identical probability, a percolation model. Using the
stochastic canonical equation methods developed by Girko for symmetric matrices
with independent upper triangular entries, a deterministic distribution is
found that asymptotically approximates the empirical spectral distribution of
the scaled adjacency matrix for a model with arbitrary parameters. The main
results characterize the form of the solution to an important system of
equations that leads to this deterministic distribution function and
significantly reduce the number of equations that must be solved to find the
solution for a given set of model parameters. Simulations comparing the
expected empirical spectral distributions and the computed deterministic
distributions are provided for sample parameters.
