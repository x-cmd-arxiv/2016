conductors is investigated. Considering a Fermi surface (FS) consisting of a
slightly corrugated cylinder and two corrugated planes distributed periodically
in the momentum space, the thermoelectric effects are considered under general
assumptions for the value of a magnetic breakdown probability. As a result of
an external generalized force, the FS sheets in layered conductors with a
multisheet FS appear to be so close that the charge carriers (as a result of
magnetic breakdown) can move from one FS sheet to another. In addition, the
distribution functions of the charge carriers and the magnetic breakdown
oscillations of thermoelectrical field along the normal to the layer, under
different values and orientations of the magnetic field, $B$, are calculated.
It is shown that if the magnetic field is deflected from the $xz$-plane at an
angle $\varphi$, the oscillation part of a thermoelectrical field along the
normal to the layer under condition $\sin\varphi\tan\vartheta \gg 1$ is mainly
determined with the Nernst-Ettingshausen effect.

compare the simulation quality for the Manning, Darcy-Weisbach, and Poiseuille

this type of flow. The Poiseuille friction model gave the best results both on

This could prevent astrophysical BH formation from axion stars with $f_a\ll

stable branch and we estimate the mass ratio of the BH to the stable state at
the phase boundary to be $\mathcal{O}(1)$ within numerical uncertainty. We
discuss the observational relevance of our findings for axion stars as BH
seeds, which are supermassive in the case of ultralight axions. For the QCD

because it has an intense bright rim. We attempt to derive physical parameters

and (1-0) and CS (3-2) and (2-1) lines. These data, augmented with stellar
photometry derived from the ESO VVV survey, were used to derive the mass and
distribution of molecular material in BHR 160 and its surroundings. Archival
mid-infrared data from the WISE satellite was used to find IR excess stars in
the globule and its neighbourhood. An elongated 1' by 0.6' core lies adjacent
to the globule bright rim. $^{12}$CO emission covers the whole globule, but the
$^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O and CS emission is more concentrated to the core. The
$^{12}$CO line profiles indicate the presence of outflowing material near the
core, but the spatial resolution of the mm data is not sufficient for a
detailed spatial analysis. The BHR 160 mass estimated from the C$^{18}$O
mapping is 100$\pm$50Msun(d/1.6kpc)$^2$ where d is the distance to the globule.
Approximately 70 percent of the mass lies in the dense core. The total mass of
molecular gas in the direction of BHR 160 is 210$\pm$(d/1.6kpc)$^2$ Msun when
estimated from the more extended VVV NIR photometry. We argue that the bright
rim of BHR 160 is produced by a close-by early B-type star, HD 319648, that was
likely recently born in the globule. This star is likely to have triggered the
formation of a source, IRS 1, that is embedded within the core of the globule
and detected only in Ks and by WISE and IRAS.

demonstrate its additional dependence on the initial OPR and, secondarily, on
the age of the source, its temperature, and its density. We conclude that the
usefulness of the [HCO$^+$]/[DCO$^+$] abundance ratio to constrain the cosmic
ray ionization rate in dense regions increases with source age and ionization
rate as the ratio becomes far less sensitive to the initial value of the OPR.

fields in a holographic model without self-duality, broke by Weyl tensor
coupling to Maxwell field, and study its response. It is found that for the
positive Weyl coupling parameter $\gamma>0$, the momentum dissipation
characterized by parameter $\hat{\alpha}$ drives the boundary conformal field
theory (CFT), in which the conductivity exhibits a peak at low frequency, into
the incoherent metallic phase with a dip, which is away from CFT due to the
introduction of axionic fields. While for $\gamma<0$, an oppositive scenario is
found. Our present model provides a possible route toward the problem that
which sign of $\gamma$ is the correct description of the CFT of boson Hubbard
model. In addition, we also investigate the DC conductivity, diffusion constant
and susceptibility. We find that for each of these observables there is a
specific value of $\hat{\alpha}$, for which these observables are independent
of $\gamma$. Finally, the electromagnetic (EM) duality is also studied and we
find that there is also a specific value of $\hat{\alpha}$, for which the
particle-vortex duality related by the change of the sign of $\gamma$ in the
boundary theory holds better than for other values of $\hat{\alpha}$.

testbeds constitute an integral and essential part of the multi-robot research

and maintain. These resource constraints, in turn, limit access for large
groups of researchers and students, which is what the Robotarium is remedying
by providing users with remote access to a state-of-the-art multi-robot test
facility. This paper details the design and operation of the Robotarium and
discusses the considerations one must take when making complex hardware
remotely accessible. In particular, safety must be built into the system
already at the design phase without overly constraining what coordinated
control programs users can upload and execute, which calls for minimally
invasive safety routines with provable performance guarantees.

dipole emitters (QDEs) located near a metal nanoparticle (MNP) exhibiting a
dipolar localized surface plasmon (LSP) resonance at the frequency of the QDE
radiative transition. Considering one QDE to be brought into an optically
active excited state and weakly coupled to the resonant LSP, we show that a
stable superposition state of two QDEs is formed during the transition time,
which is much shorter than the QDE spontaneous decay time and determined by the
efficiency of resonant interaction between the QDEs and induced LSP. It is
elucidated that the superposition state is established as a result of
redistribution of the energy of the initially excited QDE so that the
corresponding steady-state QDE fields induced at the MNP site cancel each
other. The degree of steady-state entanglement characterized by the concurrence
is found dependent only on the ratio of distances between the QDEs and the MNP,
reaching its maximum value of ~ 0.65, when the separation between the MNP and
the initially excited QDE is larger by ~ 20% than the distance from the other
QDE to the MNP.

distributions by drawing samples from a set of proposal distributions. Several
ways to compute the importance weights assigned to each sample have been
recently proposed, with the so-called deterministic mixture (DM) weights
providing the best performance in terms of variance, at the expense of an
increase in the computational cost. A recent work has shown that it is possible
to achieve a trade-off between variance reduction and computational effort by
performing an a priori random clustering of the proposals (partial DM
algorithm). In this paper, we propose a novel ""heretical"" MIS framework, where
the clustering is performed a posteriori with the goal of reducing the variance
of the importance sampling weights. This approach yields biased estimators with
a potentially large reduction in variance. Numerical examples show that
heretical MIS estimators can outperform, in terms of mean squared error (MSE),
both the standard and the partial MIS estimators, achieving a performance close

usually lasted longer than type III burst groups at frequencies greater than
100 MHz. A weak correlation was found between the type III radio flux at

of events at high X-ray intensity and low type III radio flux. Interplanetary
type III bursts less than 14 MHz were observed for 54 percent of the events,

asynchronous parallel algorithms, where a set of nodes run in parallel with
little or no synchronization, thus computing with delayed information. This
paper studies the convergence of the asynchronous parallel algorithm ARock
under potentially unbounded delays.
  ARock is a general asynchronous algorithm that has many applications. It
parallelizes fixed-point iterations by letting a set of nodes randomly choose
solution coordinates and update them in an asynchronous parallel fashion. ARock
takes some recent asynchronous coordinate descent algorithms as special cases
and gives rise to new asynchronous operator-splitting algorithms. Existing
analysis of ARock assumes the delays to be bounded, and uses this bound to set
a step size that is important to both convergence and efficiency. Other work,
though allowing unbounded delays, imposes strict conditions on the underlying
fixed-point operator, resulting in limited applications.
  In this paper, convergence is established under unbounded delays, which can
be either stochastic or deterministic. The proposed step sizes are more
practical and generally larger than those in the existing work. The step size
adapts to the delay distribution or the current delay being experienced in the
system. New Lyapunov functions, which are the key to analyzing asynchronous
algorithms, are generated to obtain our results. A set of applicable
optimization algorithms with large-scale applications are given, including
machine learning and scientific computing algorithms.

The reduced pseudosymmetric type structures for various Walker type conditions
are deduced and the existence of Venzi space is ensured. It is shown that the

generally trained on legacy databases of human quality opinion scores on
synthetically distorted images. Therefore they learn image features that
effectively predict human visual quality judgments of inauthentic, and usually
isolated (single) distortions. However, real-world images usually contain
complex, composite mixtures of multiple distortions. We study the perceptually
relevant natural scene statistics of such authentically distorted images, in
different color spaces and transform domains. We propose a bag of feature-maps
approach which avoids assumptions about the type of distortion(s) contained in
an image, focusing instead on capturing consistencies, or departures therefrom,
of the statistics of real world images. Using a large database of authentically
distorted images, human opinions of them, and bags of features computed on

the competence of the features towards improving automatic perceptual quality
prediction by testing a learned algorithm using them on a benchmark legacy

fine-tuning using electrostatic gates. We calculate and measure the nonlinear

direct photons of $7<p_T<15$ GeV/$c$ are used to study nonperturbative effects
generated by initial-state partonic transverse momentum and final-state
transverse momentum from fragmentation. The nonperturbative behavior is
characterized by measuring the out-of-plane transverse momentum component
$p_{\rm out}$ perpendicular to the axis of the trigger particle, which is the
high-$p_T$ direct photon or $\pi^0$. Nonperturbative evolution effects are
extracted from Gaussian fits to the away-side inclusive-charged-hadron yields
for different trigger-particle transverse momenta ($p_T^{\rm trig}$). The
Gaussian widths and root mean square of $p_{\rm out}$ are reported as a
function of the interaction hard scale $p_T^{\rm trig}$ to investigate possible
transverse-momentum-dependent evolution differences between the $\pi^0$-h$^\pm$
and direct photon-h$^\pm$ correlations and factorization breaking effects. The
widths are found to decrease with $p_T^{\rm trig}$, which indicates that the
Collins-Soper-Sterman soft factor is not driving the evolution with the hard
scale in nearly back-to-back dihadron and direct photon-hadron production in
$p$$+$$p$ collisions. This behavior is in contrast to Drell-Yan and
semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering measurements.

increasing average X-ray flux near periastron (at about 2.5-sigma level).
Further comparison of these data with the X-ray properties of hundreds of young
stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster, produced by the Chandra Orion Ultradeep
Project (COUP), indicates that the X-ray emission from the merged sample of our
binaries can not be explained within the framework of the COUP-like X-ray
activity. However, due to the inhomogeneities of the merged binary sample and
the relatively low statistical significance of the detected flux increase,
these findings are regarded as tentative only. More data are needed to prove
that the flux increase is real and is related to the processes of colliding
magnetospheres.

handling variables with both arbitrary distributions and complex association
patterns conditioning on covariates. We first derive its asymptotic null
distribution, and then develop a multiple testing procedure based on squac to
simultaneously test the independence between one pair of variables conditioning
on covariates for all $p(p-1)/2$ pairs. Here, $p$ is the length of the outcomes
and could exceed the sample size. The testing procedure does not require
resampling or perturbation, and thus is computationally efficient. We prove by
theory and numerical experiments that this testing method asymptotically
controls the false discovery rate (\FDR). It outperforms all alternative
methods when the complex association panterns exist. Applied to a gastric
cancer data, this testing method successfully inferred the gene co-expression
networks of early and late stage patients. It identified more changes in the
networks which are associated with cancer survivals. We extend our method to
the case that both the length of the outcomes and the length of covariates
exceed the sample size, and show that the asymptotic theory still holds.

turn out to be very important for models with right-handed currents through the
generation of left-right operators. In addition to rare decays like $P\to

initial water fractions due to random volatile delivery by planetesimals. If
the total planetary water complement is high, the entire surface may be covered
in water, forming a ""waterworld."" On a planet with active tectonics, competing
mechanisms act to regulate the abundance of water on the surface by determining
the partitioning of water between interior and surface. Here we explore how the
incorporation of different mechanisms for the degassing and regassing of water
changes the volatile evolution of a planet. For all of the models considered,
volatile cycling reaches an approximate steady-state after $\sim 2 \
\mathrm{Gyr}$. Using these steady-states, we find that if volatile cycling is
either solely dependent on temperature or seafloor pressure, exoplanets require
a high abundance ($\gtrsim 0.3\%$ of total mass) of water to have fully
inundated surfaces. However, if degassing is more dependent on seafloor
pressure and regassing mainly dependent on mantle temperature, the degassing
rate is relatively large at late times and a steady-state between degassing and
regassing is reached with a substantial surface water fraction. If this hybrid
model is physical, super-Earths with a total water fraction similar to that of
the Earth can become waterworlds. As a result, further understanding of the
processes that drive volatile cycling on terrestrial planets is needed to
determine the water fraction at which they are likely to become waterworlds.

Coherence Pursuit (CoP) to robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA). As
inliers lie in a low dimensional subspace and are mostly correlated, an inlier
is likely to have strong mutual coherence with a large number of data points.
By contrast, outliers either do not admit low dimensional structures or form
small clusters. In either case, an outlier is unlikely to bear strong
resemblance to a large number of data points. Given that, CoP sets an outlier
apart from an inlier by comparing their coherence with the rest of the data
points. The mutual coherences are computed by forming the Gram matrix of the
normalized data points. Subsequently, the sought subspace is recovered from the
span of the subset of the data points that exhibit strong coherence with the
rest of the data. As CoP only involves one simple matrix multiplication, it is
significantly faster than the state-of-the-art robust PCA algorithms. We derive
analytical performance guarantees for CoP under different models for the
distributions of inliers and outliers in both noise-free and noisy settings.
CoP is the first robust PCA algorithm that is simultaneously non-iterative,
provably robust to both unstructured and structured outliers, and can tolerate
a large number of unstructured outliers.

sediment thickness, which builds confidence that sediment transport is

$\hat c$ of a composite boson couples the $N$-coboson Fock-state not only to

failed to grow fast enough to become the cores of gas giants before the natal
protostellar disk dispersed. We model the failed cores' inward orbital
migration in the low-mass or type I regime, to stopping points at distances
where the tidal interaction with the protostellar disk applies zero net torque.
The three kinds of migration traps considered are those due to the dead zone's
outer edge, the ice line, and the transition from accretion to starlight as the
disk's main heat source. As the disk disperses, the traps move toward final
positions near or just outside 1~au. Planets at this location exceeding about
3~M$_\oplus$ open a gap, decouple from their host trap, and migrate inward in
the high-mass or type II regime to reach the vicinity of the star. We
synthesize the population of planets formed in this scenario, finding that some
fraction of the observed super-Earths can be failed cores. Most super-Earths
formed this way have more than 4~M$_\oplus$, so their orbits when the disk
disperses are governed by type II migration. These planets have solid cores
surrounded by gaseous envelopes. Their subsequent photoevaporative mass loss is
most effective for masses originally below about 6 M$_\oplus$. The failed core
scenario suggests a division of the observed super-Earth mass-radius diagram
into five zones according to the inferred formation history.

central problem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture
details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of
optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice
of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the
mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak
signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and
are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity
expected at the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a
generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our
knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic
natural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a
perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content
loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold
using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the
super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use
a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in
pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic
textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive
mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual
quality using SRGAN. The MOS scores obtained with SRGAN are closer to those of
the original high-resolution images than to those obtained with any
state-of-the-art method.

in a brown dwarf, demonstrating that large-amplitude variations are not limited
to the L/T transition but are present in some extremely red L-type dwarfs. We
report a tentative trend between the wavelength dependence of relative
amplitude, possibly proxy for small dust grains lofted in the upper atmosphere,
and the likelihood of large-amplitude variability. By assuming forsterite as
haze particle, we successfully explain the wavelength dependent amplitude with
submicron-sized haze particles sizes of around 0.4 {\mu}m. W0047 links the

two key properties of the quenching process: the quenching time scale and the
quenching rate among galaxies. We achieve this by analyzing the galaxy number
density profile in NUV-u color space and the distribution in NUV-u v.s. u-i
color-color diagram with a simple toy-model framework. We focus on galaxies in
three mass bins between 10 to 10 and 10 to 10.6 solar mass. In the NUV-u v.s.
u-i color-color diagram, the red u-i galaxies exhibit a different slope from
the slope traced by the star-forming galaxies. This angled distribution and the
number density profile of galaxies in NUV-u space strongly suggest that the
decline of the SFR in galaxies has to accelerate before they turn quiescent. We
model this color-color distribution with a two-phase exponential decline star
formation history. The models with an e-folding time in the second phase (the
quenching phase) of 0.5 Gyr best fit the data. We further use the NUV-u number
density profile to constrain the quenching rate among star-forming galaxies as
a function of mass. Adopting an e-folding time of 0.5 Gyr in the second phase
(or the quenching phase), we found the quenching rate to be 19%/Gyr, 25%/Gyr

Therefore, it naturally applies to background independent theories, e.g.
gravity, by circumventing the difficulty of specifying the position of the
entangling surface. We relate our construction to earlier proposals and argue
that it brings these closer to each other. In particular, it yields the
non-Abelian analogue of the ""magnetic centre choice"", as obtained through an
extended-Hilbert-space method, but applied to the recently introduced fusion

Most known Hot DOGs are at $z> 1.5$, due in part to a strong bias against
identifying them at lower redshift related to the selection criteria. We
present a new selection method that identifies 153 Hot DOG candidates at $z\sim

hole, would imply a black hole mass of $M_{\rm\,BH}\simeq 2 \times 10^8
M_{\odot}$, and an Eddington ratio of $\lambda_{\rm\,Edd}\simeq 2.7$. WISE
J1036+0449 is the first Hot DOG detected by NuSTAR, and the observations show
that the source is heavily obscured, with a column density of
$N_{\rm\,H}\simeq(2-15)\times10^{23}\rm\,cm^{-2}$. The source has an intrinsic
2-10 keV luminosity of $\sim 6\times 10^{44}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$, a value
significantly lower than that expected from the mid-infrared/X-ray correlation.
We also find that the other Hot DOGs observed by X-ray facilities show a
similar deficiency of X-ray flux. We discuss the origin of the X-ray weakness
and the absorption properties of Hot DOGs. Hot DOGs at $z\lesssim1$ could be
excellent laboratories to probe the characteristics of the accretion flow and

Relativity's observables as usually defined, part of the problem of time.
Definitions can be tested using equivalent formulations, non-gauge and gauge,
because they must have equivalent observables and everything is observable in
the non-gauge formulation. Taking an observable from the non-gauge formulation
and finding the equivalent in the gauge formulation, one requires that the
equivalent be an observable, constraining definitions. For massive photons, the
de Broglie-Proca non-gauge formulation observable A_{\mu} is equivalent to the
Stueckelberg-Utiyama gauge formulation quantity A_{\mu}+\partial_{\mu} \phi.
Thus observables must have 0 Poisson bracket not with each first-class
constraint, but with the Rosenfeld-Anderson-Bergmann-Castellani gauge generator
G, a tuned sum of first-class constraints, in accord with the
Pons-Salisbury-Sundermeyer definition of observables.
  The definition for external gauge symmetries can be tested using massive
gravity, where one can install gauge freedom by parametrization with clock
fields X^A. The non-gauge observable g^{\mu\nu} has the gauge equivalent
X^A,_{\mu} g^{\mu\nu} X^B,_{\nu}. The Poisson bracket of X^A,_{\mu} g^{\mu\nu}
X^B,_{\nu} with G turns out to be not 0 but a Lie derivative. This non-zero
Poisson bracket refines and systematizes Kuchar's proposal to relax the 0
Poisson bracket condition with the Hamiltonian constraint. Thus observables
need covariance, not invariance, in relation to external gauge symmetries.
  The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian for massive gravity are those of General
Relativity + Lambda + 4 scalars, so the same definition of observables applies
to General Relativity. Local fields such as g_{\mu\nu} are observables. Thus
observables change. Requiring equivalent observables for equivalent theories
also recovers Hamiltonian-Lagrangian equivalence.

predictive quantum theory of gravity valid on all length scales. Its key
ingredient is a non-Gaussian fixed point of the gravitational renormalization
group flow which controls the scaling of couplings and correlation functions at
high energy. In this work we use a functional renormalization group equation
adapted to the ADM-formalism for evaluating the gravitational renormalization
group flow on a cosmological Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background. Besides
possessing the UV-non-Gaussian fixed point characteristic for Asymptotic Safety
the setting exhibits a second non-Gaussian fixed point with a positive Newton's
constant and real critical exponents. The new fixed point alters the phase
diagram in such a way that all renormalization group trajectories connected to
classical general relativity are well-defined on all length scales. In
particular a positive cosmological constant is dynamically driven to zero in
the deep infrared. Moreover, the scaling dimensions associated with the
universality classes emerging within the causal setting exhibit qualitative
agreement with results found within the $\epsilon$-expansion around two
dimensions, Monte Carlo simulations based on Lattice Quantum Gravity, and the
discretized Wheeler-deWitt equation.

lower in the youngest quartile of our sample (ages of 500 Myr) compared to
older galaxies, which may be a result of the delayed production of PAHs by AGB
stars. The relative strength of L(7.7) to L(IR) is also lower by a factor of ~
2 for galaxies with masses $M_* < 10^{10}M_{\odot}$, compared to the more
massive ones. We demonstrate that commonly-used conversions of L(7.7) (or 24
micron flux density; f(24)) to L(IR) underestimate the IR luminosity by more
than a factor of 2 at $M_*$ ~ $10^{9.6-10.0} M_{\odot}$. We adopt a
mass-dependent conversion of L(7.7) to L(IR) with L(7.7)/L(IR)= 0.09 and 0.22
for $M_* < 10^{10}$ and $> 10^{10} M_{\odot}$, respectively. Based on the new
scaling, the SFR-$M_*$ relation has a shallower slope than previously derived.
Our results also suggest a higher IR luminosity density at z ~ 2 than
previously measured, corresponding to a ~ 30% increase in the SFR density.

inner disk into a radiatively-inefficient accretion flow, or due to the
pressure of the neutron star magnetic field. Our Chandra gratings data reveal
possible narrow emission lines near 1 keV that can be modeled as reflection or
collisionally-ionized gas, and possible low-energy absorption features that

neutron star has been able to sustain its low accretion rate through magnetic
inhibition of the accretion flow, which gives some constraints on its magnetic

Metal-rich globular clusters show a large spread in FUV-V, with some clusters
in M~31, M~81 and M~87 being much bluer than standard predictions. This
requires that some metal-rich clusters host a significant population of
blue/extreme horizontal branch (HB) stars. These hot HB stars are not
traditionally expected in metal-rich environments, but are a natural
consequence of multiple populations in clusters - since the enriched population
is observed to be He-enhanced and will therefore produce bluer HB stars, even
at high metallicity. We conclude that the observed FUV emission from metal-rich
clusters in M~31, M~81 and M~87 provides evidence that He-enhanced second
populations, similar to those observed directly in the Milky Way, may be a
ubiquitous feature of globular clusters in the local universe. Future HST FUV

consistent with a thermal relic dark matter candidate produced via freeze-out.
However, such an explanation is disfavored by constraints from CMB observations
on energy deposition during the epoch of recombination. We discuss a scenario
called late-decaying two-component dark matter (LD2DM), where the entire DM
consists of two semi-degenerate species. Within this framework, the heavier
species is produced as a thermal relic in the early universe and decays to the
lighter species over cosmological timescales. Consequently, the lighter species
becomes the DM which populates the universe today. We show that annihilation of
the lighter DM species with an enhanced cross-section, produced via such a
non-thermal mechanism, can explain the observed AMS-02 positron flux while
avoiding CMB constraints. The observed DM relic density can be correctly
reproduced as well with simple s-wave annihilation cross-sections. We
demonstrate that the scenario is safe from CMB constraints on late-time energy
depositions during the cosmic ""dark ages"". Interestingly, structure formation
constraints force us to consider small mass splittings between the two dark
matter species. We explore possible cosmological and particle physics
signatures in a toy model that realizes this scenario.

dark matter within r<100 kpc of each BCG. This conclusion may favour a cooled

Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and M33, which may comprise up to 10 per cent of their
host's total mass. Massive satellites can change the orbital barycentre of the
host-satellite system by tens of kiloparsecs and are cosmologically expected to
harbor dwarf satellite galaxies of their own. Assessing the impact of these
effects depends crucially on the orbital histories of the LMC and M33. Here, we
revisit the dynamics of the MW-LMC system and present the first detailed
analysis of the M31-M33 system utilizing high precision proper motions and
statistics from the dark matter-only Illustris cosmological simulation. With
the latest Hubble Space Telescope proper motion measurements of M31, we
reliably constrain M33's interaction history with its host. In particular, like
the LMC, M33 is either on its first passage (t_{inf} < 2 Gyr ago) or if M31 is
massive (>=2x10^12 Msun), it is on a long period orbit of about 6 Gyr.
Cosmological analogs of the LMC and M33 identified in Illustris support this
picture and provide further insight about their host masses. We conclude that,
cosmologically, massive satellites like the LMC and M33 are likely completing
their first orbits about their hosts. We also find that the orbital energies of
such analogs prefer a MW halo mass ~1.5x10^12 Msun and an M31 halo mass
>=1.5x10^12 Msun. Despite conventional wisdom, we conclude it is highly
improbable that M33 made a close (< 100 kpc) approach to M31 recently (
t_{peri} < 3 Gyr ago). Such orbits are rare (< 1 per cent) within the 4$\sigma$
error space allowed by observations. This conclusion cannot be explained by
perturbative effects through four body encounters between the MW, M31, M33, and
the LMC. This surprising result implies that we must search for a new
explanation for M33's strongly warped gas and stellar discs.

explain the largest enhancements in [Eu/Fe] observed in stars at low [Fe/H]

capable of producing a successful sGRB. Soon after coalescence, winds are
launched from the merger remnant. In this paper, we use realistic wind profiles
derived from global merger simulations in order to investigate the interaction
of sGRB jets with these winds using numerical simulations. We analyze the
conditions for which these axisymmetric winds permit relativistic jets to
breakout and produce a sGRB. We find that jets with luminosities comparable to
those observed in sGRBs are only successful when their half-opening angles are
below ~20{\deg}. This jet collimation mechanism leads to a simple physical
interpretation of the luminosities and opening angles inferred for sGRBs. If
wide, low luminosity jets are observed, they might be indicative of a different
progenitor avenue such as the merger of a neutron star with a black hole. We
also use the observed durations of sGRB to place constraints on the lifetime of
the wind phase, which is determined by the time it takes the jet to breakout.

the manifestation of colour perception derived from visible light and the
physiology of the perception of colour. That is, in terms of the physics of
visible light, photobiology and the human subjective interpretation of visible

system exhibits interesting field theoretic phenomena when the Higgs mass is
close to the stop-antistop production threshold. Existing work in the
literature has examined the digluon-to-diphoton cross section near threshold
and has focused on enhancements in the cross section that might arise either
from the perturbative contributions to the Higgs-to-digluon and
Higgs-to-diphoton form factors or from mixing of the Higgs boson with stoponium
states. Near threshold, enhancements in the relevant amplitudes that go as
inverse powers of the stop-antistop relative velocity require resummations of
perturbation theory and/or nonperturbative treatments. We present a complete
formulation of threshold effects at leading order in the stop-antistop relative
velocity in terms of nonrelativistic effective field theory. We give detailed
numerical calculations for the case in which the stop-antistop Green's function
is modeled with a Coulomb-Schr\""odinger Green's function. We find several
general effects that do not appear in a purely perturbative treatment.
Higgs-stop-antistop mixing effects displace physical masses from the threshold
region, thereby rendering the perturbative threshold enhancements inoperative.
In the case of large Higgs-stop-antistop couplings, the displacement of a
physical state above threshold substantially increases its width, owing to its
decay width to a stop-antistop pair, and greatly reduces its contribution to
the cross section.

significant effective luminosity improvements. This manifests through an
improvement in the significance $S/\delta B$, relative to conventional methods.
Qjets also provide novel observables in many cases, like mass-volatility, that
could be used to further discriminate between signal and background events. The
statistical robustness and volatility observables, for tagging, are obtained
simultaneously. We explore here a combination of the two techniques, and
demonstrate that significant enhancements in discovery potentials may be
obtained in non-trivial ways. We will illustrate this by considering a diboson

scenarios where the gains are purely due to statistical robustness and
scenarios where the gains are also reinforced by volatility variable
discriminants. The former, for instance, is applicable to digluon/diquark
resonances, while the latter will be of relevance to di-$W^\pm$/di-$Z^0$
resonances, where the boosted vector bosons are decaying hadronically and have
an intrinsic mass scale attached to them. We argue that one can enhance signal
significance and discovery potentials markedly through stochastic grooming, and
help augment studies at the Large Hadron Collider and future hadron colliders.

true, this effect should be pronounced in young open clusters, due to the rapid
rotation and strong magnetic activity of their most extreme members. We explore
this possibility by determining empirical radii for 83 members of the nearby
Pleiades open cluster, using spectral energy distribution fitting to establish
$\mathcal{F}_{bol}$ with a typical accuracy of $\approx$3\% together with color
and spectro-photometric indices to determine $T_{\rm eff}$. We find several
Pleiades members with radii inflated above radius-$T_{\rm eff}$ models from
state-of-the-art calculations, and apparent dispersions in radii for the
K-dwarfs of the cluster. Moreover, we demonstrate that this putative radius
inflation correlates strongly with rotation rate, consistent with inflation of
young stars by magnetic activity and/or starspots. We argue that this signal is
not a consequence of starspot-induced color anomalies, binarity, or depth
effects in the cluster, employing Gaia DR1 distances as a check. Finally, we
consider the lithium abundances of these stars, demonstrating a triple
correlation between rotation rate, radius inflation, and enhanced lithium
abundance. Our result---already significant to $\sim$99.99%

energy-efficient flow routing on the backhaul network as an optimization

to both turn off idle nodes and concentrate traffic on the smallest possible

responsible for each plasmonic color and their distributions are observed to be
similar for both burst and non-burst modes, indicating that the underlying

bursts show significant increase in the electron-phonon coupling coefficient
which is crucial for the creation of well-defined ripple structures. Finite

Although intuitive, recent work in deep learning has shown this approach is
prone to missing important predictive features. To circumvent this issue, we
present a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach where we initially
represent the multiagent behavior as an image. To encode the adversarial nature
of basketball, we use a multi-channel image which we then feed into a CNN.
Additionally, to capture the temporal aspect of the trajectories we ""fade"" the
player trajectories. We find that this approach is superior to a traditional
FFN model. By using gradient ascent to create images using an already trained
CNN, we discover what features the CNN filters learn. Last, we find that a
combined CNN+FFN is the best performing network with an error rate of 39%.

show that the coupling to the photon mode takes the spin system into a mixed

half of the spins in the excited state. We show that there is a non-zero
probability for this to collapse into a dark state with RVB character. In the
lossy cavity limit, if no photon is detected within several decay time periods,

and molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis. In contrast, relatively
little is known about population dynamic processes, by which bacteria colonize
hosts and invade tissues and cells and thereby cause disease. In an article
published in 1978, Moxon and Murphy presented evidence that, when inoculated
intranasally with a mixture streptomycin sensitive and resistant (Sm$^S$ and
Sm$^R$) and otherwise isogenic stains of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib),
neonatal rats develop a bacteremic infection that often is dominated by only
one strain, Sm$^S$ or Sm$^R$. After rulling out other possibilities through
years of related experiments, the field seems to have settled on a plausible
explanation for this phenomenon: the first bacterium to invade the host
activates the host immune response that `shuts the door' on the second invading
strain. To explore this hypothesis in a necessarily quantitative way, we
modeled this process with a set of mixed stochastic and deterministic
differential equations. Our analysis of the properties of this model with
realistic parameters suggests that this hypothesis cannot explain the
experimental results of Moxon and Murphy, and in particular the observed
relationship between the frequency of different types of blood infections
(bacteremias) and the inoculum size. We propose modifications to the model that
come closer to explaining these data. However, the modified and better fitting
model contradicts the common theory of independent action of individual
bacteria in establishing infections. We discuss the implications of these
results.

origin of these velocity shifts, and show that they could be originated by
rotation in the flow, or by side to side asymmetries in the shock velocity,
which could be due to asymmetries in the jet ejection velocity/density or in
the ambient medium. For typical poloidal jet velocities (~ 100-200 km/s), an
asymmetry >~ 10% can produce velocity shifts comparable to those observed. We
also present three dimensional numerical simulations of rotating, precessing
and asymmetric jets, and show that, even though for a given jet there is a
clear degeneracy between these effects, a statistical analysis of jets with
different inclination angles can help to distinguish between the alternative
origins of transverse velocity shifts. Our analysis indicate that side to side
velocities asymmetries could represent an important contribution to transverse
velocity shifts, being the most important contributor for large jet inclination
angles (with respect the the plane of the sky), and can not be neglected when
interpreting the observations.

asymmetric along the line of sight (LOS) owing to the presence of the small
second order terms such as the gravitational redshift (GRedshift). We identify
two systematics in the modelling of the GRedshift signal in stacked clusters.
First, it is affected by the morphology of dark matter haloes and the
large-scale cosmic-web. The non-spherical distribution of galaxies around the
central halo and the presence of neighbouring clusters systematically reduce
the GRedshift signal. This bias is approximately 20% for $M_{\rm min}\simeq
10^{14} {\rm M_{\odot}}/h$, and is more than 50% for haloes with $M_{\rm

best-fit gravitational redshift profiles as well as the profiles of all other
relativistic terms are found to be significantly different in velocity space
compared to their real space versions. We discuss some subtleties relating to
these effects in velocity space. We also find that the S/N of the GRedshift
signal increases with decreasing halo mass.

dependent reaction rates, a sequential regeneration pattern emerges: the larger
$\psi(2S)$ width, relative to the $J/\psi$, around and below the critical
temperature, implies that most of the $\psi(2S)$ states are regenerated later
in the evolution of the fireball. This has noticeable consequences for the
transverse-momentum ($p_T$) spectra of the regenerated charmonia. While the
total yield of $\psi(2S)$ meson remains smaller than those of $J/\psi$'s, their
harder $p_T$ spectra can produce a double ratio above unity for a $p_T>3$GeV

relation extraction, especially in cases with limited supervision. However,
existing distance supervision approaches only extract relations expressed in

under-explored, even in the supervised-learning setting. In this paper, we
propose the first approach for applying distant supervision to cross- sentence
relation extraction. At the core of our approach is a graph representation that
can incorporate both standard dependencies and discourse relations, thus
providing a unifying way to model relations within and across sentences. We
extract features from multiple paths in this graph, increasing accuracy and
robustness when confronted with linguistic variation and analysis error.
Experiments on an important extraction task for precision medicine show that
our approach can learn an accurate cross-sentence extractor, using only a small
existing knowledge base and unlabeled text from biomedical research articles.
Compared to the existing distant supervision paradigm, our approach extracted
twice as many relations at similar precision, thus demonstrating the prevalence
of cross-sentence relations and the promise of our approach.

i.e. the longer an issue lingers in the system, the more effort it requires to
resolve. This belief is often used to justify major investments in new
development processes that promise to retire more issues sooner.
  This paper tests for the delayed issue effect in 171 software projects
conducted around the world in the period from 2006--2014. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the largest study yet published on this effect. We found no
evidence for the delayed issue effect; i.e. the effort to resolve issues in a
later phase was not consistently or substantially greater than when issues were
resolved soon after their introduction.
  This paper documents the above study and explores reasons for this mismatch
between this common rule of thumb and empirical data. In summary, DIE is not
some constant across all projects. Rather, DIE might be an historical relic
that occurs intermittently only in certain kinds of projects. This is a
significant result since it predicts that new development processes that
promise to faster retire more issues will not have a guaranteed return on
investment (depending on the context where applied), and that a long-held truth

on-board resources such as processing power and energy. A promising approach is
to generate intelligent schedules that reduce the resource consumption while
maintaining best performance, or more interestingly, to trade off reduced
resource consumption for a slightly lower but still acceptable level of
performance. In this paper, we provide a framework to aid designers in
exploring such resource-performance trade-offs and finding schedules for mobile
robots, guided by questions such as ""what is the minimum resource budget
required to achieve a given level of performance?"" The framework is based on a
quantitative multi-objective verification technique which, for a collection of
possibly conflicting objectives, produces the Pareto front that contains all
the optimal trade-offs that are achievable. The designer then selects a
specific Pareto point based on the resource constraints and desired performance
level, and a correct-by-construction schedule that meets those constraints is
automatically generated. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on
several robotic scenarios in both simulations and experiments with encouraging
results.

corroborated by a diffusion function that measures the correlated motion of

alternative ones are not excluded. It turns out that both the sign cross- and

and interpret the price impacts of time lag in terms of temporary and permanent

the memory properties of the sign self- and average cross-correlators. The

the energy supply probability at the transmitter, and the achievable rate at

multiple phenotype association analysis paradigm lacks breadth (number of
phenotypes and genetic variants jointly analyzed at the same time) and depth
(hierarchical structure of phenotype and genotypes). A key issue for high
dimensional pleiotropic analysis is to effectively extract informative internal
representation and features from high dimensional genotype and phenotype data.
To explore multiple levels of representations of genetic variants, learn their
internal patterns involved in the disease development, and overcome critical
barriers in advancing the development of novel statistical methods and
computational algorithms for genetic pleiotropic analysis, we proposed a new
framework referred to as a quadratically regularized functional CCA (QRFCCA)

regularized matrix factorization, (2) functional data analysis and (3)
canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Large-scale simulations show that the
QRFCCA has a much higher power than that of the nine competing statistics while
retaining the appropriate type 1 errors. To further evaluate performance, the
QRFCCA and nine other statistics are applied to the whole genome sequencing
dataset from the TwinsUK study. We identify a total of 79 genes with rare
variants and 67 genes with common variants significantly associated with the 46
traits using QRFCCA. The results show that the QRFCCA substantially outperforms
the nine other statistics.

account at the quark level. The nucleon is described as the combination of
three constituent quarks confined by a harmonic oscillator potential. To
satisfy the spirit of QCD theory, the contributions of pion and gluon on the
nucleon structure are treated in second-order perturbation theory. For the
nuclear many-body system, nucleons interact with each other by exchanging
mesons between quarks. With different constituent quark mass, $m_q$, we
determine three parameter sets about the coupling constants between mesons and
quarks, named as QMF-NK1, QMF-NK2, and QMF-NK3 by fitting the ground-state
properties of several closed-shell nuclei. It is found that all of the three

variable stars in the Galactic globular $\omega$ Cen (NGC 5139). We secured
8202 CCD images covering a time interval of 24 years and a sky area of 84x48
arcmin. The current data were complemented with data available in the
literature and provided new, homogeneous pulsation parameters (mean magnitudes,
luminosity amplitudes,periods) for 187 candidate $\omega$ Cen RR Lyrae (RRLs).
Among them we have 101 RRc (first overtone), 85 RRab (fundamental) and a single
candidate RRd (double-mode) variables. Candidate Blazhko RRLs show periods and
colors that are intermediate between RRc and RRab variables, suggesting that
they are transitional objects.
  The comparison of the period distribution and of the Bailey diagram indicates
that RRLs in $\omega$ Cen show a long-period tail not present in typical
Oosterhoff II (OoII) globulars. The RRLs in dwarf spheroidals and in ultra
faint dwarfs have properties between Oosterhoff intermediate and OoII clusters.
Metallicity plays a key role in shaping the above evidence. These findings do
not support the hypothesis that $\omega$ Cen is the core remnant of a spoiled
dwarf galaxy.
  Using optical Period-Wesenheit relations that are reddening-free and
minimally dependent on metallicity we find a mean distance to $\omega$ Cen of
13.71$\pm$0.08$\pm$0.01 mag (semi-empirical and theoretical calibrations).
Finally, we invert the I-band Period-Luminosity-Metallicity relation to
estimate individual RRLs metal abundances. The metallicity distribution agrees
quite well with spectroscopic and photometric metallicity estimates available
in the literature.

that a time dimension adds considerable complexity even when the problem is

  We also discuss special cases of $k$-TSN in which the graph changes satisfy a
monotonicity property. We show approximation-preserving reductions from
monotonic $k$-TSN to well-studied problems such as Priority Steiner Tree and
Directed Steiner Tree, implying improved approximation algorithms.
  Lastly, $k$-TSN and its variants arise naturally in computational biology; to

population, the near-infrared band photometry also provide a robust estimate of
the stellar mass, which for the VGS galaxies we confirm to be smaller than $3

includes two early-type galaxies, one of which is an AGN. Their S\'{e}rsic

evaluating the impact and quality of publications in two specific settings:
biomedicine and economics. Our study exposes the extent and type of metrics
used in external evaluations of candidates for academic positions at Swedish
universities. Moreover, we show how different bibliometric indicators, both
explicitly and implicitly, are employed to value and rank candidates. Our
findings contribute to a further understanding of bibliometric indicators as
judgment devices that are employed in evaluating individuals and their
published works within specific fields. We also show how expertise in using
bibliometrics for evaluative purposes is negotiated at the interface between
domain knowledge and skills in using indicators. In line with these results we
propose that the use of metrics in this context is best described as a form of
citizen bibliometrics - an underspecified term which we build upon in the

dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor. A detailed comparison of this DBD
ignited in a so-called burst mode (i.e. where an AC voltage is applied during a
limited amount of time) and pure AC mode is carried out to evaluate their
effect on the conversion of CO2 as well as on the energy efficiency. Decreasing
the duty cycle in the burst mode from 100% (i.e. corresponding to pure AC mode)
to 40% leads to a rise in the conversion from 16--26% and to a rise in the
energy efficiency from 15 to 23%. Based on a detailed electrical analysis, we
show that the conversion correlates with the features of the microfilaments.
Moreover, the root-mean-square voltage in the burst mode remains constant as a
function of the process time for the duty cycles \textless{}70%, while a higher
duty cycle or the usual pure AC mode leads to a clear voltage decay by more
than 500 V, over approximately 90 s, before reaching a steady state regime. The
higher plasma voltage in the burst mode yields a higher electric field. This
causes the increasing the electron energy, and therefore their involvement in
the CO2 dissociation process, which is an additional explanation for the higher
CO2 conversion and energy efficiency in the burst mode.

plasmas at atmospheric pressure. Whatever their configuration (tubular or

charge build up in the plasma and the formation of a thermal arc. In this
article, the role of the barrier thickness (2.0, 2.4 and 2.8 mm) and of the
kind of dielectric material (alumina, mullite, pyrex, quartz) is investigated
on the filamentary behavior in the plasma and on the CO2 conversion in a
tubular flowing DBD, by means of mass spectrometry measurements correlated with
electrical characterization and IR imaging. Increasing the barrier thickness
decreases the capacitance, while preserving the electrical charge. As a result,
the voltage over the dielectric increases and a larger number of
microdischarges is generated, which enhances the CO2 conversion. Furthermore,
changing the dielectric material of the barrier, while keeping the same
geometry and dimensions, also affects the CO2 conversion. The highest CO2
conversion and energy efficiency are obtained for quartz and alumina, thus not
following the trend of the relative permittivity. From the electrical
characterization, we clearly demonstrate that the most important parameters are
the somewhat higher effective plasma voltage (yielding a somewhat higher
electric field and electron energy in the plasma) for quartz, as well as the
higher plasma current (and thus larger electron density) and the larger number
of microdischarge filaments (mainly for alumina, but also for quartz). The
latter could be correlated to the higher surface roughness for alumina and to
the higher voltage over the dielectric for quartz.

meaningfully segmenting the data and then encoding it. When the wrench

centered on the $\epsilon$ Orionis supergiant (HD 37128, B0\,Ia) and covering
the Orion Belt asterism.
  We used a combination of optical (SDSS) and near-infrared (2MASS) data,
informed by X-ray (\textit{XMM-Newton}) and mid-infrared (WISE) data, to
construct a suite of color-color and color-magnitude diagrams for all available
sources. We then applied a new statistical multiband technique to isolate a
previously unknown stellar population in this region.
  We identify a rich and well-defined stellar population in the surveyed region
that has about 2\,000 objects that are mostly M stars. We infer the age for
this new population to be at least 5\, Myr and likely $\sim10$\,Myr and
estimate a total of about 2\,500 members, assuming a normal IMF. This new
population, which we call the Orion Belt population, is essentially
extinction-free, disk-free, and its spatial distribution is roughly centered
near $\epsilon$ Ori, although substructure is clearly present.
  The Orion Belt population is likely the low-mass counterpart to the Ori OB Ib
subgroup. Although our results do not rule out Blaauw's sequential star
formation scenario for Orion, we argue that the recently proposed blue streams
scenario provides a better framework on which one can explain the Orion star
formation region as a whole. We speculate that the Orion Belt population could
represent the evolved counterpart of an Orion nebula-like cluster.

conditions due to current heating. By applying the theory of Kubakaddi [S. S.
Kubakaddi, Phys. Rev. B 79, 075417 (2009)], a model describing the 1/f noise
power spectral density of nonequilibrium mesoscopic conductance fluctuations in
epitaxial graphene is developed and used to determine the energy loss rate per
carrier. In the regime of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations a strong increase of
1/f noise is observed, which we attribute to an additional conductance
fluctuation mechanism due to localized states in quantizing magnetic fields.
When the device enters the regime of quantized Hall resistance, the 1/f noise
vanishes. It reappears if the current is increased and the quantum Hall
breakdown sets in.

in an edge-colored graph (called MaxCDP) has been recently introduced in
literature, motivated by applications in social network analysis. In this paper
we investigate how the complexity of the problem depends on graph parameters
(namely the number of vertices to remove to make the graph a collection of
disjoint paths and the size of the vertex cover of the graph), which makes
sense since graphs in social networks are not random and have structure. The
problem was known to be hard to approximate in polynomial time and not
fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) for the natural parameter. Here, we show that
it is still hard to approximate, even in FPT-time. Finally, we introduce a new
variant of the problem, called MaxCDDP, whose goal is to find the maximum
number of vertex-disjoint and color-disjoint uni-color paths. We extend some of
the results of MaxCDP to this new variant, and we prove that unlike MaxCDP,
MaxCDDP is already hard on graphs at distance two from disjoint paths.

  Games",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In population games, a large population of players, modeled as a continuum,
is divided into subpopulations, and the fitness or payoff of each subpopulation
depends on the overall population composition. Evolutionary dynamics describe
how the population composition changes in response to the fitness levels,
resulting in a closed-loop feedback system. Recent work established a
connection between passivity theory and certain classes of population games,
namely so-called ""stable games"". In particular, it was shown that a combination
of stable games and (an analogue of) passive evolutionary dynamics results in
stable convergence to Nash equilibrium. This paper considers the converse
question of necessary conditions for evolutionary dynamics to exhibit stable
behaviors for all generalized stable games. Here, generalization refers to
""higher order"" games where the population payoffs may be a dynamic function of
the population state. Using methods from robust control analysis, we show that
if an evolutionary dynamic does not satisfy a passivity property, then it is
possible to construct a generalized stable game that results in instability.
The results are illustrated on selected evolutionary dynamics with particular
attention to replicator dynamics, which are also shown to be lossless, a
special class of passive systems.

of interest to study the line formation process further. We investigate the
multidimensional effects on the interpretation of spectropolarimetric
observations, particularly on the inference of the magnetic field vector. We do
this by analyzing the differences between multidimensional models, which
involve fully self-consistent radiative transfer computations in the presence
of spatial inhomogeneities and velocity fields, and those which rely on simple
one-dimensional geometry. We study the formation of a prototype line in ad hoc
inhomogeneous, isothermal 2D prominence models. We solve the NLTE polarized
line formation problem in the presence of a large-scale oriented magnetic
field. The resulting polarized line profiles are then interpreted (i.e.
inverted) assuming a simple 1D slab model. We find that differences between
input and the inferred magnetic field vector are non-negligible. Namely, we
almost universally find that the inferred field is weaker and more horizontal
than the input field. Spatial inhomogeneities and radiative transfer have a
strong effect on scattering line polarization in the optically thick lines. In
real-life situations, ignoring these effects could lead to a serious
misinterpretation of spectropolarimetric observations of chromospheric objects

average growth, the fluctuations, and the ranking of the export values observed

an optimal self organization of the global export. According to the model,

all-cause mortality and inappropriate shock in contemporary studies of patients
receiving a primary prophylactic ICD.
  DATA SOURCE: PubMed, LIVIVO, Cochrane CENTRAL between 2010 and 2016.
  STUDY SELECTION: Studies providing at least 1 gender-specific risk estimate
for the outcomes of interest.
  DATA EXTRACTION: Abstracts were screened independently for potentially

two authors.
  DATA SYNTHESIS: Out of 680 abstracts retained by our search strategy, 20
studies including 46'657 patients had gender-specific information on at least
one of the relevant endpoints. Mean age across the individual studies varied
between 58 and 69 years. The proportion of women enrolled ranged from 10% to

appropriate shock compared with men (pooled multivariable adjusted hazard ratio
0.62 (95% CI [0.44; 0.88]). Across 14 studies reporting multivariable adjusted
gender-specific hazard ratio estimates for all-cause mortality, women had a
lower risk of death than men (pooled hazard ratio 0.75 (95% CI [0.66; 0.86]).
There was no statistically significant difference for the incidence of first
inappropriate shocks (3 studies, pooled hazard ratio 0.99 (95% CI [0.56;

  CONCLUSION: In this large contemporary meta-analysis, women had a
significantly lower risk of appropriate shocks and death than men, but a
similar risk of inappropriate shocks. These data may help to select patients
who benefit from primary prophylactic ICD implantation.

form a coalition with a certain collective objective. Simple games are used to
model systems that can decide whether coalitions are successful (winning) or
not (losing). A simple game can be viewed as a monotone boolean function. The
dimension of a simple game is the smallest positive integer $d$ such that the
simple game can be expressed as the intersection of $d$ threshold functions
where each threshold function uses a threshold and $n$ weights. Taylor and
Zwicker have shown that $d$ is bounded from above by the number of maximal

supplements a recent result where Olsen et al. showed how to construct simple

that strain and shear produce characteristic Moir\'e patterns which can have
the same visual appearance on a large scale, but representing graphene bilayers
with quite different electronic properties. The different features in the
low-energy electronic bands can be ascribed to the effect of a fictitious
non-Abelian gauge field mimicking the smooth modulation of the stacking order.
Strained and sheared bilayers show a complementary behavior, which can be
understood from the fact that the non-Abelian gauge field acts as a repulsive
interaction in the former, expelling the electron density away from the
stacking domain walls, while behaving as a confining interaction leading to
localization of the electronic states in the sheared bilayers. In this latter
case, the presence of the effective gauge field explains the development of
almost flat low-energy bands, resembling the form of the zeroth Landau level
characteristic of a Dirac fermion field. The estimate of the gauge field
strength in those systems gives a magnitude of the order of several tens of
Tesla, implying a robust phenomenology that should be susceptible of being
observed in suitably distorted bilayer samples.

System's dynamical history. The current belt only contains ${\rm \sim 10^{-3}}$
Earth masses yet the asteroids' orbits are dynamically excited, with a large
spread in eccentricity and inclination. In the context of models of terrestrial
planet formation, the belt may have been excited by Jupiter's orbital
migration. The terrestrial planets can also be reproduced without invoking a
migrating Jupiter; however, as it requires a severe mass deficit beyond Earth's
orbit, this model systematically under-excites the asteroid belt. Here we show
that the orbits of the asteroids may have been excited to their current state
if Jupiter and Saturn's early orbits were chaotic. Stochastic variations in the
gas giants' orbits cause resonances to continually jump across the main belt
and excite the asteroids' orbits on a timescale of tens of millions of years.
While hydrodynamical simulations show that the gas giants were likely in mean
motion resonance at the end of the gaseous disk phase, small perturbations
could have driven them into a chaotic but stable state. The gas giants' current
orbits were achieved later, during an instability in the outer Solar System.
Although it is well known that the present-day Solar System exhibits chaotic
behavior, our results suggest that the early Solar System may also have been
chaotic.

highly tunable adhesives. These materials are composed of polymer chains
functionalized by strongly interacting moieties, sometimes called ""stickers"".
In order to systematically investigate the effect of the presence of
associative groups on the debonding properties of a supramolecular adhesive, a
series of supramolecular model systems has been characterized by probe-tack
tests. These model materials, composed of linear and low dispersity
poly(butylacrylate) chains functionalized in the middle by a single tri-urea
sticker, are able to self-associate by six hydrogen bonds and range in
molecular weight (M n) between 5 and 85 kg/mol. The linear rheology and the
nanostructure of the same materials (called ""PnBA3U"") was the object of a
previous study 1,2. At room temperature, the association of polymers via
hydrogen bonds induces the formation of rod-like aggregates structured into
bundles for M n \textless{} 40kg/mol and the behavior of a soft elastic
material was observed (G'\textgreater{}\textgreater{}G ""and G'~$\omega$ 0). For
higher M n , the filaments were randomly oriented and polymers displayed a
crossover towards viscous behavior although terminal relaxation was not reached
in the experimental frequency window. All these materials show however similar
adhesive properties characterized by a cohesive mode of failure and low
debonding energies (W adh \textless{}40J/m 2 for a debonding speed of
100$\mu$m/s). The debonding mechanisms observed during the adhesion tests have
been investigated in detail with an Image tools analysis developed by our group
3. The measure of the projected area covered by cavities growing in the
adhesive layer during debonding can be used to estimate the true stress in the
walls of the cavities and thus, to characterize the in-situ large strain
deformation of the thin layer during the adhesion test itself. This analysis
revealed in particular that the PnBA3U materials with M n \textless{} 40 kg/mol
soften very markedly at large deformation like yield stress fluids, explaining
the low adhesion energies measured for these viscoelastic gels. 2

developing a method combining atomistic Green's function and Bayesian

interfacial structure, the method identifies the optimal structures from
calculations of only a few percent of the entire candidates (over 60,000
structures). The obtained optimal interfacial structures are non-intuitive and
impacting: the minimum-ITC structure is an aperiodic superlattice that realizes
50% reduction from the best periodic superlattice. The physical mechanism of
the minimum ITC can be understood in terms of crossover of the two effects on
phonon transport: as the layer thickness in superlattice increases, the impact
of Fabry-P\'erot interference increases, and the rate of reflection at the
layer-interfaces decreases. Aperiodic superlattice with spatial variation in
the layer thickness has a degree of freedom to realize optimal balance between
the above two competing mechanism. Furthermore, aperiodicity breaks the
constructive phonon interference between the interfaces inhibiting the coherent
phonon transport. The present work shows the effectiveness and advantage of
material informatics in designing nanostructures to control heat conduction,
which can be extended to other interfacial structures.

quantum spin Hall insulator in two-dimensional (2D) systems with time-reversal

time-reversal invariant systems where a direct transition between two
insulators is generally predicted, we find that the topological phase
transition in systems with an additional two-fold rotation symmetry is mediated
by an emergent stable two-dimensional Weyl semimetal phase between two
insulators. Here the central role is played by the so-called space-time
inversion symmetry, the combination of time-reversal and two-fold rotation
symmetries, which guarantees the quantization of the Berry phase around a 2D
Weyl point even in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling.
Pair-creation/pair-annihilation of Weyl points accompanying partner exchange
between different pairs induces a jump of a 2D $Z_{2}$ topological invariant
leading to a topological phase transition. According to our theory, the
topological phase transition in HgTe/CdTe quantum well structure is mediated by
a stable 2D Weyl semimetal phase since the quantum well, lacking inversion
symmetry intrinsically, has two-fold rotation about the growth direction.
Namely, the HgTe/CdTe quantum well can show 2D Weyl semimetallic behavior
within a small but finite interval in the thickness of HgTe layers between a
normal insulator and a quantum spin Hall insulator. We also propose that
few-layer black phosphorus under perpendicular electric field is another
candidate system to observe the unconventional topological phase transition
mechanism accompanied by emerging 2D Weyl semimetal phase protected by
space-time inversion symmetry.

certain cases, such as computational efficiency of parameter estimation in
non-linear models or derivation of estimators of the degrees of freedom for
model selection criteria. With this paper, we provide the scientific community
with a differentiable penalty, which can be used in any situation, but
particularly where differentiability plays a key role. We show some desirable
features of this function and prove theoretical properties of the resulting
estimators within a regularized regression context. A simulation study and the
analysis of a real dataset show overall a good performance under different
scenarios. The method is implemented in the R package DLASSO freely available
from CRAN.

  This paper seeks to remedy this deficit, by providing a systematic large

surrounding 90 different political parties in 23 different countries. It shows
that political party groupings which are further apart in ideological terms
interact less, and that individuals and parties which sit at the extreme ends

exchanges between centrist parties who sit on different sides of the left-right
divide are more likely than communication between centrist and extremist

a sea of polymers with specific binding zones for the tracer. These binding
zones act as traps. Our simulations show that the tracer can undergo normal yet
non-Gaussian diffusion under certain circumstances, e.g, when the polymers with
traps are frozen in space and the volume fraction and the binding strength of
the traps are moderate. In this case, as the tracer moves, it experiences a
heterogeneous environment and exhibits confined continuous time random walk
(CTRW) like motion resulting a non-Gaussian behavior. Also the long time
dynamics becomes subdiffusive as the number or the binding strength of the
traps increases. However, if the polymers are mobile then the tracer dynamics
is Gaussian but could be normal or subdiffusive depending on the number and the
binding strength of the traps. In addition, with increasing binding strength
and the number of the polymer traps, the probability of the tracer being
trapped increases. On the other hand, removing the binding zones does not
result trapping, even at comparatively high crowding. Our simulations also show
that the trapping probability increases with the increasing size of the tracer
and for a bigger tracer with the frozen polymer background the dynamics is only
weakly non-Gaussian but highly subdiffusive. Our observations are in the same
spirit as found in many recent experiments on tracer diffusion in polymeric
materials and questions the validity of Gaussian theory to describe diffusion
in crowded environment in general.

parameters are normally exploited: the critical semimajor axis ac computed by
Holman and Wiegert (1999) within which planets are stable against the binary
perturbations, and the Hill stability limit Delta determining the minimum
separation beyond which two planets will avoid mutual close encounters. Our aim
is to test whether these two parameters can be safely applied in multiplanet
systems in binaries or if their predictions fail for particular binary orbital
configurations. We have used the frequency map analysis (FMA) to measure the
diffusion of orbits in the phase space as an indicator of chaotic behaviour.
First we revisited the reliability of the empirical formula computing ac in the
case of single planets in binaries and we find that, in some cases, it
underestimates by 10-20% the real outer limit of stability. For two planet
systems, the value of Delta is close to that computed for planets around single
stars, but the level of chaoticity close to it substantially increases for
smaller semimajor axes and higher eccentricities of the binary orbit. In these
configurations ac also begins to be unreliable and non linear secular
resonances with the stellar companion lead to chaotic behaviour well within ac,
even for single planet systems. For two planet systems, the superposition of
mean motion resonances, either mutual or with the binary companion, and non
linear secular resonances may lead to chaotic behaviour in all cases. We have
developed a parametric semiempirical formula determining the minimum value of
the binary semimajor axis, for a given eccentricity of the binary orbit, below
which stable two planet systems cannot exist.

where data can be seen as a cube, where each cell contains one or more measures
can be aggregated along dimensions. Despite the extensive corpus of work in the
field, a standard language for OLAP is still needed, since there is no
well-defined, accepted semantics, for many of the usual OLAP operations. In
this paper, we address this problem, and present a set of operations for
manipulating a data cube. We clearly define the semantics of these operations,
and prove that they can be composed, yielding a language powerful enough to
express complex OLAP queries. We express these operations as a sequence of
atomic transformations over a fixed multidimensional matrix, whose cells
contain a sequence of measures. Each atomic transformation produces a new
measure. When a sequence of transformations defines an OLAP operation, a flag
is produced indicating which cells must be considered as input for the next
operation. In this way, an elegant algebra is defined. Our main contribution,
with respect to other similar efforts in the field is that, for the first time,
a formal proof of the correctness of the operations is given, thus providing a
clear semantics for them. We believe the present work will serve as a basis to

problem of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral $\int_a^b {f\left( t \right)du\left(

recently by many authors. However, a small attention and a few works have been
considered for mappings of two variables; i.e., The approximation problem of
the Riemann-Stieltjes double integral $\int_a^b {\int_c^d {f\left( {t,s}
\right)d_s d_t u\left( {t,s} \right)} }$ in terms of the Riemann-Stieltjes
double sums. This study is devoted to obtain several bounds for $\int_a^b
{\int_c^d {f\left( {t,s} \right)d_s d_t u\left( {t,s} \right)} }$ under various
assumptions on the integrand $f$ and the integrator $u$. Mainly, the concepts
of bounded variation and bi-variation are used at large in the thesis. Several
proposed cubature formula are introduced to approximate such double integrals.
For mappings of two variables several inequalities of Trapezoid, Gr\""{u}ss and
Ostrowski type for mappings of bounded variation, bounded bi-variation,
Lipschitzian and monotonic are introduced and discussed. Namely, Trapezoid-type
rules for $\mathcal{RS}$-Double integrals are proved, and therefore the
classical Hermite-Hadamard inequality for mappings of two variables is
established. A Korkine type identity is used to obtain several Gr\""{u}ss type
inequalities for integrable functions. Finally, approximating real functions of

pre-stellar cores (with T<10 K), has challenged our understanding of the
formation processes of COMs in the interstellar medium. Recent modelling on COM
chemistry at low temperatures has provided new insight into these processes
predicting that COM formation depends strongly on parameters such as visual
extinction and the level of CO freeze out. We report deep observations of COMs
toward two positions in the L1544 pre-stellar core: the dense,
highly-extinguished continuum peak with Av>=30 mag within the inner 2700 au;
and a low-density shell with average Av~7.5-8 mag located at 4000 au from the
core's center and bright in CH3OH. Our observations show that CH3O, CH3OCH3 and
CH3CHO are more abundant (by factors ~2-10) toward the low-density shell than
toward the continuum peak. Other COMs such as CH3OCHO, c-C3H2O, HCCCHO, CH2CHCN
and HCCNC show slight enhancements (by factors <=3) but the associated
uncertainties are large. This suggests that COMs are actively formed and
already present in the low-density shells of pre-stellar cores. The modelling
of the chemistry of O-bearing COMs in L1544 indicates that these species are
enhanced in this shell because i) CO starts freezing out onto dust grains
driving an active surface chemistry; ii) the visual extinction is sufficiently
high to prevent the UV photo-dissociation of COMs by the external interstellar
radiation field; and iii) the density is still moderate to prevent severe
depletion of COMs onto grains.

experiments and theory have demonstrated that certain antiferromagnets with a

AHE at zero field due to a non-vanishing Berry curvature arising from the

antiferromagnetic Mn5Si3 single crystals exibit a large AHE which is strongly
anisotropic and shows multiple transitions with sign changes at different
magnetic fields due to field-induced rearrangements of the magnetic structure
despite only tiny variations of the total magnetization. The presence of
multiple non-collinear magnetic phases offers the unique possiblity to explore

indicate the difference between the magnitude of a planet and that of its
parent star. A table of these delta values for exo-planets possessing a range

angle 90 degrees where a planet is near the greatest apparent separation from
its star. This quantity may be useful in exo-planet detection and observation

For tritium, a special radionuclide that readily enters the life cycle, the

inadequately understood. For example, tritiated water (HTO) enters plants by
leaf and root uptake and is converted to organically bound tritium (OBT) in
exchangeable and non-exchangeable forms; however, the observed OBT/HTO ratios
in crops exhibit large variability and contradict the current models for
routine releases. Non-routine or spike releases of tritium further complicate
the prediction of OBT formation. The experimental data for a short and intense
atmospheric contamination of wheat are presented together with various models

is a long process, it is dependent on receptor location and stack dynamics,
there are differences between night and day releases, and the HTO dynamics in
leaf and ear is a very important contributor to OBT formation.

exquisite targets for detailed atmospheric characterisation with JWST and

significant sample of transiting terrestrial planets orbiting nearby brown
dwarfs could prove to be useful not only for comparative exoplanetology but
also for astrobiology, by bringing us key information on the physical
requirements and timescale for the emergence of life.
  In this context, we present a search for transit-signals in archival
time-series photometry acquired by the Spitzer Space Telescope for a sample of
44 nearby brown dwarfs. While these 44 targets were not particularly selected
for their brightness, the high precision of their Spitzer light curves allows
us to reach sensitivities below Earth-sized planets for 75% of the sample and
down to Europa-sized planets on the brighter targets. We could not identify any
unambiguous planetary signal. Instead, we could compute the first limits on the
presence of planets on close-in orbits. We find that within a 1.28 day orbit,
the occurrence rate of planets with a radius between 0.75 and 3.25 R$_\oplus$
is {\eta} < 67 $\pm$ 1%. For planets with radii between 0.75 and 1.25
R$_\oplus$, we place a 95% confident upper limit of {\eta} < 87 $\pm$ 3%. If we
assume an occurrence rate of {\eta} = 27% for these planets with radii between
0.75 and 1.25 R$_\oplus$, as the discoveries of the Kepler-42b and TRAPPIST-1b

the second-order conic programming (SOCP) relaxation of an alternating current
optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem. The affine inequalities serve as cuts to
get rid of points outside of the feasible region of AC OPF with semi-definite
programming (SDP) relaxation. Hence, the affine inequalities are names as SDP
cuts. While AC OPF with SDP relaxation has a high computational complexity, AC
OPF with SOCP has a much lower computational complexity. Recent research has
found that the feasible region of SDP relaxation is contained inside the
feasible region of the SOCP relaxation. Therefore, the integration of SDP cuts
into SOCP relaxation provides better scalability compared to the SDP relaxation
and a tighter gap compared to the SOCP relaxation. The SDP cuts are generated
by solving least square estimation (LSE) problems at cycle basis and further
exploring the geometric characteristic of LSE. General feasibility cuts
generating method is also employed for analysis. We found that the SDP cuts
generated by LSE method are indeed feasibility cuts. The SDP cuts effectively
reduce the search space. Case studies of systems with several buses to hundreds
of buses have demonstrated the method is very effective in reducing the gaps.

unresolved region to the chromosphere, underestimating the upflows. Here, we
treat the lower transition region as a discontinuity that responds to changing
coronal conditions through the imposition of a jump condition that is derived
from an integrated form of energy conservation. To illustrate and benchmark
this approach against a fully resolved one-dimensional model, we present
field-aligned simulations of coronal loops in response to a range of impulsive
(spatially uniform) heating events. We show that our approach leads to a
significant improvement in the coronal density evolution than just when using
coarse spatial resolutions insufficient to resolve the lower transition region.
Our approach compensates for the jumping of the heat flux by imposing a
velocity correction that ensures that the energy from the heat flux goes into
driving the transition region dynamics, rather than being lost through
radiation. Hence, it is possible to obtain improved coronal densities. The
advantages of using this approach in both one-dimensional hydrodynamic and
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations are discussed.

the empty intermediate band (IB), located in the fundamental gap and mainly
composed of Fe 3d orbitals. Laser-irradiation (at 808 nm) of an aqueous

conversion efficiency of 49%. Such efficient heating is ascribable to the
carrier relaxation within the broad IB band (owing to the indirect VB-IB gap),
as corroborated by transient absorption measurements. The intense absorption
and high photothermal transduction efficiency (PTE) of these NCs in the
so-called biological window (650-900 nm) makes them suitable for photothermal
therapy as demonstrated by tumor cell annihilation upon laser irradiation. The

levels constituting the IB is the origin of such enhanced PTE, which can be
used to design other high performing NC photothermal agents.

  Communications",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we utilize the framework of compressed sensing (CS) for
distributed device detection and resource allocation in large-scale
machine-to-machine (M2M) communication networks. The devices deployed in the
network are partitioned into clusters according to some pre-defined criteria.
Moreover, the devices in each cluster are assigned a unique signature of a
particular design that can be used to indicate their active status to the
network. The proposed scheme in this work mainly consists of two essential
steps: (i) The base station (BS) detects the active clusters and the number of
active devices in each cluster using a novel block sketching algorithm, and
then assigns a certain amount of resources accordingly. (ii) Each active device
detects its ranking among all the active devices in its cluster using an
enhanced greedy algorithm and accesses the corresponding resource for
transmission based on the ranking. By exploiting the correlation in the device
behaviors and the sparsity in the activation pattern of the M2M devices, the
device detection problem is thus tackled as a CS support recovery procedure for
a particular binary block-sparse signal $x\in\mathbb{B}^N$ -- with block
sparsity $K_B$ and in-block sparsity $K_I$ over block size $d$. Theoretical
analysis shows that the activation pattern of the M2M devices can be reliably
reconstructed within an acquisition time of $\mathcal{O}(\max\{K_B\log N,
K_BK_I\log d\})$, which achieves a better scaling and less computational
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N(K_I^2+\log N))$ compared with standard CS
algorithms. Moreover, extensive simulations confirm the robustness of the
proposed scheme in the detection process, especially in terms of higher
detection probability and reduced access delay when compared with conventional
schemes like LTE random access (RA) procedure and classic cluster-based access
approaches.

research into generative graph models. Kronecker-style models (SKG and R-MAT)
are often used due to their scalability and ability to mimic key properties of

models' behavior for specific parameters, many claims used to justify their use

asymptotic analysis which illustrate that empirical studies may not fully

  Paramount to the widespread adoption of Kronecker-style models was the
introduction of a linear-time edge-sampling variant (R-MAT), which existing
literature typically treats as interchangeable with SKG. We prove that although
several R-MAT formulations are asymptotically equivalent, their behavior
diverges from that of SKG. Further, we show these results are observable even
at relatively small graph sizes. Second, we consider a case where asymptotic

inner Time Projection Chamber (iTPC) upgrade to the forward tracking. The
rapidity coverage for PID would extend to only 0.8 without the eTOF upgrade.
The eTOF upgrade will enable precision studies of the key bulk property

laboratory-scale device was built that utilizes a surface-piercing stainless
steel belt that travels in a loop around two vertical rollers, with one length
of the belt between the rollers acting as a horizontally-moving flat wall. The
belt is accelerated suddenly from rest until reaching constant speed in order
to create a temporally-evolving boundary layer analogous to the
spatially-evolving boundary layer that would exist along a surface-piercing
towed flat plate. Surface profiles are measured with a cinematic laser-induced
fluorescence system and sub-surface velocity fields are recorded using a
high-speed planar particle image velocimetry system. It is found that the belt
initially travels through the water without creating any significant waves,
before the free surface bursts with activity close to the belt surface. These
free surface ripples travel away from the belt before appearing to become
freely-propagating waves. From sub-surface velocity measurements, it is found
that close to the surface, transition to turbulence happens sooner than far
from the surface, leading to an overall thicker boundary layer in the vicinity
of the free surface. A secondary peak in streamwise velocity fluctuations
accompanies this transition to turbulence and this peak reaches a maximum value
a short time later before smoothing outward. Using momentum thickness as a
length scale and the streamwise velocity fluctuations at the location of this
outer peak as a velocity scale, free surface bursting and air entrainment onset

for dependent multimodal data fusion (e.g., based on copula theory), a commonly

binarization of Radon projections and by assembling them into a vector, namely
the barcode. A simple local thresholding has been suggested for binarization.
In this paper, we put forward the idea of ""autoencoded Radon barcodes"". Using
images in a training dataset, we autoencode Radon projections to perform
binarization on outputs of hidden layers. We employed the mini-batch stochastic
gradient descent approach for the training. Each hidden layer of the
autoencoder can produce a barcode using a threshold determined based on the
range of the logistic function used. The compressing capability of autoencoders
apparently reduces the redundancies inherent in Radon projections leading to
more accurate retrieval results. The IRMA dataset with 14,410 x-ray images is
used to validate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental
results, containing comparison with RBCs, SURF and BRISK, show that autoencoded
Radon barcode (ARBC) has the capacity to capture important information and to
learn richer representations resulting in lower retrieval errors for image
retrieval measured with the accuracy of the first hit only.

input/instruction can be recognized by identifying the motion trajectory of the

identification process is modelled as an in- verse source problem where one
intends to identify the trajectory of a moving point source. There are several
salient features of our study which distinguish our result from the existing
ones in the literature. First, the point source is moving in an inhomogeneous
background medium, which models the human body. Second, the dynamical wave
field data are collected in a limited aperture. Third, the recon- struction
method is independent of the background medium, and it is totally direct
without any matrix inversion. Hence, it is efficient and robust with respect to

the result into a unit gradient function. The eigenfunctions are then used to
synthesize distance values abiding by these constraints at desired locations.

server queues in which routing decisions are based on deadlines. Specifically,
at each node in the network, the total service time equals the minimum of
several independent service times (e.g. the minimum of the amount of time
required to complete a transaction and a deadline). Furthermore, routing
decisions depend on which of the independent service times achieves the minimum
(e.g. exceeding a deadline will require the customer to be routed so they can
re-attempt the transaction). Because current routing decisions are dependent on
past service times, much of the existing theory on product-form queueing
networks does not apply. In spite of this, we are able to show that such
networks have product-form equilibrium distributions. We verify our analytic
characterization with a simulation of a simple network. We also discuss
extensions of this work to more general settings.

For this purpose, we generalize the model of Brailovsky et al. to include
distinct process kinetics and reactant heterogeneity. The generalized model is
derived analytically and validated with other established models in the limit
of infinite Lewis number for zero-order and first-order kinetics. Cellular and
dendritic instabilities are found at low Lewis numbers thanks to a dynamic
adaptive mesh refinement technique that reduces finite size effects, which can
affect or even preclude the emergence of these patterns. This technique also
allows achieving very large computational domains, enabling the study of
system-size effects. Our numerical linear stability analysis is consistent with
the analytical results of Brailovsky et al. The distinct types of dynamics
found in the vicinity of the critical Lewis number, ranging from steady-state
cells to continued tip-splitting and cell-merging, are well described within
the framework of thermo-diffusive instabilities and are consistent with
previous numerical studies. These types of dynamics are classified as
""quasi-linear"" and characterized by low amplitude cells and may follow the mode
selection mechanism and growth prescribed by the linear theory. Below this
range of Lewis number, highly non-linear effects become prominent and large
amplitude, complex cellular and {\it{seaweed}} dendritic morphologies emerge.

  on Philosophy and Computers 17, (2) pages 49 to 54",,,,"cs.OH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The concept of ""logical depth"" introduced by Charles H. Bennett (1988) seems
to capture, at least partially, the notion of organized complexity, so central
in big history. More precisely, the increase in organized complexity refers
here to the wealth, variety and intricacy of structures, and should not be
confused with the increase of random complexity, formalized by Kolmogorov
(1965). If Bennett is right in proposing to assimilate organized complexity
with ""computational content"", then the fundamental cause of the increase of
complexity in the universe is the existence of computing mechanisms with
memory, and able to cumulatively create and preserve computational contents. In
this view, the universe computes, remembers its calculations, and reuses them
to conduct further computations. Evolutionary mechanisms are such forms of
cumulative computation with memory and we owe them the organized complexity of
life. Language, writing, culture, science and technology can also be analyzed
as computation mechanisms generating, preserving and accelerating the increase
in organized complexity. The main unifying theme for big history is the energy
rate density, a metric based on thermodynamics. However useful, this metric
does not provide much insight into the role that information and computation
play in our universe. The concept of ""logical depth"" provides a new lens to
examine the increase of organized complexity. We argue in this paper that
organized complexity is a valid and useful way to make sense of big history.
Additionally, logical depth has a rigorous formal definition in theoretical
computer science that hints at a broader research program to quantify
complexity in the universe.

rare scenarios, as well as exercising most of the code, is a challenge
amplified by the complexity of the interactions between the environment and the

processes and facilitate reaching rare scenarios during testing. In this paper,
we compare using Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents as models for test
generation with more conventional automata-based techniques that exploit model
checking, in terms of practicality, performance, transferability to different
scenarios, and exploration (`coverage'), through two case studies: a
cooperative manufacturing task, and a home care scenario. The results highlight
the advantages of using BDI agents for test generation. BDI agents naturally
emulate the agency present in Human-Robot Interactions (HRIs), and are thus
more expressive than automata. The performance of the BDI-based test generation
is at least as high, and the achieved coverage is higher or equivalent,
compared to test generation based on model checking automata.

Fermi, whose lunchtime remarks did not pertain to the existence of
extraterrestrial intelligence, but to the feasibility of interstellar travel.
Instead, the paradox is ascribed to Hart and Tipler, and it is further
suggested that the paradox is not a real problem or research subject and should
not be used in debates about SETI projects. The arguments given are
unpersuasive, ahistorical, and, in at least one instance, clearly hinge on
literalistic and uncharitable reading of evidence. Instead, I argue the
following three points: (i) Contrary to Gray's assertion, the historical issue
of naming of ideas or concepts is completely divorced from their epistemic
status. (ii) FP is easily and smoothly generalized into the Great Silence
paradox, so it makes no sense either theoretically or empirically to separate
the two. (iii) In sharp contrast to the main implication of Gray's paper, FP
has become more aggravated lately due to advances in astrobiology.

well as to the diverse phenomena of dielectric polarization and magnetization
of matter, just as to the electrical charges and the electrical currents. The
eulerian approach of the solid lattice developed here includes Maxwell's

reduced to a vector one by contraction on the tensor indices. Considering the
