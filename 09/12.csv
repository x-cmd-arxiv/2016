unique information about faint and low luminosity source populations, which is
inaccessible for conventional large-scale structure (LSS) studies based on
resolved sources. We used Chandra data of the XBOOTES field
($\sim9\,\mathrm{deg^2}$) to conduct the most accurate measurement to date of
the power spectrum of fluctuations of the unresolved CXB on the angular scales
of $\sim3\,$arcsec $-$ $\sim17\,$arcmin. We find that at sub-arcmin angular
scales, the power spectrum is consistent with the AGN shot noise, without much
need for any significant contribution from their one-halo term. This is
consistent with the theoretical expectation that low-luminosity AGN reside
alone in their dark matter halos. However, at larger angular scales we detect a
significant LSS signal above the AGN shot noise. Its power spectrum, obtained
after subtracting the AGN shot noise, follows a power law with the slope of
$-0.8\pm0.1$ and its amplitude is much larger than what can be plausibly
explained by the two-halo term of AGN. We demonstrate that the detected LSS
signal is produced by unresolved clusters and groups of galaxies. For the flux
limit of the XBOOTES survey, their flux-weighted mean redshift equals
$\left<z\right>\sim0.3$, and the mean temperature of their intracluster medium
(ICM), $\left<T\right>\approx 1.4$ keV, corresponds to the mass of $M_{500}
\sim 10^{13.5}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. The power spectrum of CXB fluctuations
carries information about the redshift distribution of these objects and the
spatial structure of their ICM on the linear scales of up to $\sim$Mpc, i.e. of
the order of the virial radius.

tens of kpc, much larger than the stellar body. In order to understand the
impact of these gas reservoirs on the host galaxies, we analyse the
distribution of star formation out to large radii as a function of HI
properties using GALEX UV and SDSS optical images. Our sample consists of 18
HI-rich galaxies as well as 55 control galaxies where no HI has been detected.
In half of the HI-rich galaxies the radial UV profile changes slope at the
position of the HI radial profile peak. To study the stellar populations, we
calculate the FUV-NUV and UV-optical colours in two apertures, 1-3 and 3-10
R$_{eff}$ . We find that HI -rich galaxies are on average 0.5 and 0.8 mag bluer
than the HI-poor ones, respectively. This indicates that a significant fraction
of the UV emission traces recent star formation and is associated with the HI
gas. Using FUV emission as a proxy for star formation, we estimate the
integrated star formation rate in the outer regions (R > 1R$_{eff}$) to be on
average $6 \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the HI-rich galaxies. This
rate is too low to build a substantial stellar disc and, therefore, change the
morphology of the host. We find that the star formation efficiency and the gas
depletion time are similar to those at the outskirts of spirals.

feature of the algorithm is that it avoids the computation of Fr\'echet or
G\^ateaux derivatives of the cost functional, which can be time consuming, but
rather moves in a projected-gradient direction that is easily computable (for a
class of problems) and does not require any explicit derivatives. The algorithm
is applicable to a class of problems where a pointwise minimizer of the
Hamiltonian is computable by a simple formula, and this includes many problems
that arise in theory and applications. The natural setting for the algorithm is
the space of continuous-time relaxed controls, whose special structure renders
the analysis simpler than the setting of ordinary controls. While the space of
relaxed controls has theoretical advantages, its elements are abstract entities
that may not be amenable to computation. Therefore, a key feature of the
algorithm is that it computes adequate approximations to relaxed controls
without loosing its theoretical convergence properties. Simulation results,
including cpu times, support the theoretical developments.

radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of the formation and evolution of hot
bubbles in PNe, with and without thermal conduction, are used to calculate the
X-ray emission and study its time-dependence and relationship to the changing
stellar parameters. Instabilities in the wind-wind interaction zone produce
clumps and filaments in the swept-up shell of nebular material. Turbulent
mixing and thermal conduction at the corrugated interface can produce
quantities of intermediate temperature and density gas between the hot, shocked
wind bubble and the swept-up photoionized nebular material, which can emit in
soft, diffuse X-rays. We use the CHIANTI software to compute synthetic spectra
for the models and calculate their luminosities. We find that models both with
conduction and those without can produce the X-ray temperatures and
luminosities that are in the ranges reported in observations, although the
models including thermal conduction are an order of magnitude more luminous
than those without. Our results show that at early times the diffuse X-ray
emission should be dominated by the contribution from the hot, shocked stellar
wind, whereas at later times the nebular gas will dominate the spectrum. We
analyse the effect of sampling on the resultant spectra and conclude that a
minimum of 200 counts is required to reliably reproduce the spectral shape.
Likewise, heavily smoothed surface-brightness profiles obtained from low-count
detections of PNe do not provide a reliable description of the spatial
distribution of the X-ray emitting gas.

relation on the product space $M[a,b]\times C[a,b]$, where $M[a,b]$ is the
Polish space of real-valued measurable functions on $[a,b]$ and where $C[a,b]$

same methods, it is also shown that the class of indefinite Denjoy integrals,
called $ACG_{\ast}[a,b]$, is a coanalytic but not Borel subclass of the space
$C[a,b]$, thus answering a question posed by Dougherty and Kechris. Some basic
model theory of the associated spaces of integrable functions is also studied.
Here the main result is that, when viewed as an $\mathbb{R}[X]$-module with the
indeterminate $X$ being interpreted as the indefinite integral, the space of
continuous functions on the interval $[a,b]$ is elementarily equivalent to the
Lebesgue-integrable and Denjoy-integrable functions on this interval, and each
is stable but not superstable, and that they all have a common decidable theory

proposed policy and algorithm. Computational results on the selected instances
show that the algorithm can outperform the myopic policy by 23% to 28% over

to the structure and connectivity of language. However, one shortcoming of
current approaches is focusing on only one type of linguistic relationship at a
time, missing the complex multi-relational nature of language. In this work, we
overcome this limitation by modelling the mental lexicon of English-speaking
toddlers as a multiplex lexical network, i.e. a multi-layered network where
N=529 words/nodes are connected according to four types of relationships: (i)
free associations, (ii) feature sharing, (iii) co-occurrence, and (iv)
phonological similarity. We provide analysis of the topology of the resulting
multiplex and then proceed to evaluate single layers as well as the full
multiplex structure on their ability to predict empirically observed age of
acquisition data of English speaking toddlers. We find that the emerging
multiplex network topology is an important proxy of the cognitive processes of
acquisition, capable of capturing emergent lexicon structure. In fact, we show
that the multiplex topology is fundamentally more powerful than individual
layers in predicting the ordering with which words are acquired. Furthermore,
multiplex analysis allows for a quantification of distinct phases of lexical
acquisition in early learners: while initially all the multiplex layers
contribute to word learning, after about month 23 free associations take the
lead in driving word acquisition.

using a perturbative renormalization group and within the $\epsilon$ expansion
close to four space-time dimensions. For a vanishing $U(1)$ charge we show that
quantum fluctuations may render the phase transition continuous only
sufficiently far away from 3+1 dimensions, where the validity of the
conclusions based on the leading order $\epsilon$ expansion appear
questionable. In the presence of a fluctuating gauge field, on the other hand,

flat lax extension. Every ordinary monad on the comma category $\bf{Set}/{\rm
ob}\mathcal{Q}$ with a lax extension to $\mathcal{Q}$-$\bf{Rel}$ gives rise to
such a 2-monad on $\mathcal{Q}$-$\bf{Cat}$, and we describe this process
globally as a coreflective embedding. The $\mathcal{Q}$-presheaf and the double
$\mathcal{Q}$-presheaf monads are important examples of 2-monads on
$\mathcal{Q}$-$\bf{Cat}$ allowing flat lax extensions to
$\mathcal{Q}$-$\bf{Dist}$, and so are their submonads, obtained by the
restriction to conical (co)presheaves and known as the $\mathcal{Q}$-Hausdorff
and double $\mathcal{Q}$-Hausdorff monads, which we define here in full
generality, thus generalizing some previous work in the case when $\mathcal{Q}$
is a quantale, or just the ""metric"" quantale $[0,\infty]$. Their discretization
leads naturally to various lax extensions of the relevant $\bf{Set}$-monads
used in monoidal topology.

mechanical oscillations and convert it into electrical energy. Widely extended
are those based on piezoelectric materials, whose dynamics are Hamiltonian
submitted to different sources of dissipation: damping and coupling. These
dissipations bring the system to low energy regimes, which is not desired in
long term as it diminishes the absorbed energy. To avoid or to minimize such
situations, we propose that the coupling of two oscillators could benefit from
theory of Arnold diffusion. Such phenomenon studies $O(1)$ energy variations in
Hamiltonian systems and hence could be very useful in energy harvesting
applications. This article is a first step towards this goal. We consider two
piezoelectric beams submitted to a small forcing and coupled through an
electric circuit. By considering the coupling, damping and forcing as
perturbations, we prove that the unperturbed system possesses a $4$-dimensional
Normally Hyperbolic Invariant Manifold with $5$ and $4$-dimensional stable and
unstable manifolds, respectively. These are locally unique after the
perturbation. By means of the parameterization method, we numerically compute
parameterizations of the perturbed manifold, its stable and unstable manifolds
and study its inner dynamics. We show evidence of homoclinic connections when
the perturbation is switched on.

two-sided detector. We discuss the evolution of the wave function in the
configuration space and stress the interest of a non-symmetric detector in a
quantum-measurement perspective. Next we use a time-independent approach to
study the scattering of a plane wave on a single-sided detector. Preliminary
results are obtained, analytically for the single-spin case and numerically for
up to 8 spins. They show that the spin-excitation probabilities are sometimes
very sensitive to the parameters of the model, which corroborates the idea that
the measurement result could be determined by the atom positions. The possible
origin of decoherence and entropy increase in future models is finally
discussed.

essential for properly describing stationary states after a quantum quench, and
must be included in the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). We find that similar
charges are also necessary for the GGE description of integrable quantum field
theories with non-diagonal scattering. A stationary state in a non-diagonal
scattering theory is completely specified by fixing the mode-ocuppation density
distributions of physical particles, as well auxiliary particles which carry no

Lorentz spin, related to the integrability of the model, are unable to fix the

kinematical properties of physical particles. The field theory analogs of
quasilocal lattice charges are therefore necessary. As a concrete example, we
find the complete set of charges needed in the sine-Gordon model, by using the
fact that this field theory is recovered as the continuum limit of a spatially

transfer rate (ITR). In order to fully exploit the capabilities of such
devices, it is necessary to understand the features of SSVEP and design the
system considering its biological characteristics. This paper introduces
bio-inspired filter banks (BIFB) for a novel SSVEP frequency detection method.
It is known that SSVEP response to a flickering visual stimulus is frequency
selective and gets weaker as the frequency of the stimuli increases. In the
proposed approach, the gain and bandwidth of the filters are designed and tuned
based on these characteristics while also incorporating harmonic SSVEP
responses. This method not only improves the accuracy but also increases the
available number of commands by allowing the use of stimuli frequencies elicit
weak SSVEP responses. The BIFB method achieved reliable performance when tested
on datasets available online and compared with two well-known SSVEP frequency
detection methods, power spectral density analysis (PSDA) and canonical
correlation analysis (CCA). The results show the potential of bio-inspired
design which will be extended to include further SSVEP characteristic (e.g.
time-domain waveform) for future SSVEP based BCIs.

disk chemical enrichment via photoevaporation. Predictions for the Oxygen and
Nitrogen abundances, core masses, and total amount of heavy elements for the

Jupiter and Saturn will have a small residual core and comparable total amounts

the same order as carbon, phosphorus and sulfur for both planets. Cometary
Nitrogen abundances does not allow to easily reproduce Jupiter's nitrogen
observations. In the case with disk PE, less core erosion is needed to
reproduce the chemical composition of the atmospheres, so both planets will end
up with possibly more massive residual cores, and higher total mass of heavy
elements. It is also significantly easier to reproduce Jupiter's Nitrogen
abundance. No single was disk was found to form both Jupiter and Saturn with
all their constraints in the case without photoevaporation. No model was able
to fit the constraints on Uranus & Neptune, hinting toward a more complicated

from the recent finding that any stochastic differential equation possesses a

reveal the presence of a transient long-range order both in space and time,

algorithm for solving zero-sum imperfect-information games. Regret-Based
Pruning (RBP) is an improvement that allows poorly-performing actions to be
temporarily pruned, thus speeding up CFR. We introduce Total RBP, a new form of
RBP that reduces the space requirements of CFR as actions are pruned. We prove
that in zero-sum games it asymptotically prunes any action that is not part of

directly observed due to the confining nature of the strong force. The LHC uses
pp collisions to probe the highest energy reactions involving quarks and gluons
happening at the smallest distance scales ever studied in a terrestrial
laboratory. The quantum properties of the initiating partons are encoded in the
distribution of energy inside and around jets. These quantum properties of jets
(QPJ) can be used to study the high energy nature of the strong force and
provide a way to tag the hadronic decays of heavy boosted particles. The ATLAS
detector is well-suited to perform measurements of the structure of high energy
jets. A variety of novel techniques utilizing the unique capabilities of the
ATLAS calorimeter and tracking detectors are introduced in order to probe the
experimental and theoretical limits of the QPJ.
  Quarks and gluons may also be the key to understanding fundamental problems
with the SM. In particular, the top quark has a unique relationship with the
newly discovered Higgs boson and as such could be a portal to discovering new
particles. In many extensions of the SM, the top quark has a partner with
similar properties. For example, a SUSY stop could solve The Hierarchy Problem.
Miraculously, a SUSY neutralino could also account for the DM observed in the
universe and may be copiously produced in stop decays. High-energy top quarks
from stops result in jets with a rich structure that can be identified using
the techniques developed in the study of the QPJ. While there is no significant
evidence for stop production at the LHC, the stringent limits established by
this search have important implications for SUSY and other models.

indicates great potential to reduce the hazard at possible future sites of

the seismic quiescence in a regional scale area, detected by using the two

14 on the Hinagu fault zone (FZ), followed by active seismicity including an
M6.4 quake. Eventually, an M7.3 quake occurred on Apr 16 on the Futagawa FZ. We
investigated if any sign indicative of the M7.3 quake could be found in the
space-time changes of seismicity after the M6.5 quake. We determined in advance
the threshold magnitude, above which all earthquakes are completely recorded.
We then showed that the occurrence rate of relatively large (M >= 3)
earthquakes significantly decreased 1 day before the M7.3 quake. Significance
of this decrease was evaluated by one standard deviation of sampled changes in
the rate of occurrence. We next confirmed that seismicity with M >= 3 was well
modeled by the OU law with p ~ 1.5 +/- 0.3, which indicates that the temporal
decay of seismicity was significantly faster than a typical decay with p = 1.
The larger p value was obtained when we used data of the longer time period in
the analysis. This significance was confirmed by a bootstrapping approach. Our
detailed analysis shows that the large p value was caused by the rapid decay of
the seismicity in the northern area around the Futagawa FZ. Application of the
slope (the b value) of the GR frequency-magnitude distribution to the
spatiotemporal change in the seismicity revealed that the b value in the
northern area increased significantly, the increase being db = 0.3-0.5.
Significance was verified by a statistical test of db and a test using
bootstrapping errors. Based on our findings, combined with the results obtained
by a stress inversion analysis performed by the NIED, we suggested that stress
near the Futagawa FZ had reduced just prior to the occurrence of the M7.3
quake. We proposed, with some other observations, that a reduction in stress
might have been induced by growth of the slow slips on the Futagawa FZ.

theory to derive the rate equation for governing the model's dynamics that can
analytically determine the critical noise $f_c$ in the limit of infinite
network size $N\rightarrow \infty$. The result shows that $f_c$ depends on the

derive the Langevin equation and obtain the potential of the corresponding
Fokker-Planck equation. This allows us to calculate the effective critical

technique to estimate small molecule solvation free energies. There is a wide
range of methods available for predicting solvation free energies, ranging from
empirical statistical models to ab initio quantum mechanical approaches. Each
of these methods is based on a set of conceptual assumptions that can affect
predictive accuracy and transferability. Using an iterative statistical
process, we have selected and combined solvation energy estimates using an
ensemble of 17 diverse methods from the fourth Statistical Assessment of
Modeling of Proteins and Ligands (SAMPL) blind prediction study to form a
single, aggregated solvation energy estimate. The ensemble design process
evaluates the statistical information in each individual method as well as the
performance of the aggregate estimate obtained from the ensemble as a whole.
Methods that possess minimal or redundant information are pruned from the
ensemble and the evaluation process repeats until aggregate predictive
performance can no longer be improved. We show that this process results in a
final aggregate estimate that outperforms all individual methods by reducing
estimate errors by as much as 91% to 1.2 kcal/mol accuracy. We also compare our
iterative refinement approach to other statistical ensemble approaches and
demonstrate that this iterative process reduces estimate errors by as much as
61%. This work provides a new approach for accurate solvation free energy
prediction and lays the foundation for future work on aggregate models that can
balance computational cost with prediction accuracy.

and the average power consumption in a communication system. In our system, the
arrivals occur at each timeslot according to a Bernoulli arrival process and
are buffered at the transmitter. The transmitter determines the scheduling
policy of how many packets to transmit under an average power constraint. The
power is assumed to be an increasing and convex function of the number of
packets transmitted in each timeslot to capture the realism in communication
systems. We also consider a finite buffer and allow the scheduling decision to
depend on the buffer occupancy. This problem is modelled as a Constrained
Markov Decision Process (CMDP). We first prove that the optimal policy of the
(Lagrangian) relaxation of the CMDP is deterministic and threshold-based. We
then show that the optimal delay-power tradeoff curve is convex and piecewise
linear, where each of the vertices are obtained by the optimal solution to the
relaxed problem. This allows us to show the optimal policies of the CMDP are
threshold-based, and hence can be implemented by a proposed efficient
algorithm. The theoretical results and the algorithm are validated by Linear
Programming and simulations.

for actual materials. Moreover, the anharmonicity of such magnetoelastic

zero-temperature decay. Here we show that in noncollinear antiferromagnets, a
strong magnon-phonon coupling can significantly enhance the anharmonicity,
resulting in the creation of magnetoelastic excitations and their spontaneous
decay. By measuring the spin waves over the full Brillouin zone and carrying
out anharmonic spin wave calculations using a Hamiltonian with an explicit
magnon-phonon coupling, we have identified a hybrid magnetoelastic mode in

the means of numerical simulations that combine a hydrodynamic treatment of the
shock wave with a kinetic treatment of particle acceleration. Performing 3D
simulations allows us to produce synthetic projected maps and spectra of the
thermal and non-thermal emission, that can be compared with multi-wavelength
observations (in radio, X-rays, and gamma-rays). Supernovae come in different
types, and although their energy budget is of the same order, their remnants
have different properties, and so may contribute in different ways to the pool
of Galactic cosmic-rays. Our first simulations were focused on thermonuclear
supernovae, like Tycho's SNR, that usually occur in a mostly undisturbed
medium. Here we present our 3D simulations of core-collapse supernovae, like
the Cas A SNR, that occur in a more complex medium bearing the imprint of the

characterized by certain symmetry properties, such as maximal breaking of
parity and favored helicity. These are related to the $V-A$ structure of the
weak interaction. These characteristics were discovered by studying
correlations in the directions of the outgoing leptons in nuclear beta decays.
These days, correlation measurements in nuclear beta decays are intensively
studied to probe for signatures for deviations from these symmetries, which are
an indication of Beyond Standard Model physics. We show that the structure of
the energy spectrum of emitted electrons in unique first-forbidden
$\beta$-decays is sensitive to the symmetries of the weak interaction, and thus
can be used as a novel probe of physics beyond the standard model. Furthermore,
the energy spectrum gives constraints both in the case of right and left
coupling of the new symmetry currents. We show that a measurement with modest
energy resolution of about 20 keV is expected to lead to new constraints on
beyond the standard model interactions with tensor symmetry.

detection at the $1\,$mJy level. Due to the improvement in the continuum

$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at sub-arcsecond angular resolution. We extracted 70
centimeter continuum sources associated with 1.2$\,$mm dust clumps. Most
sources are weak, compact, and are prime candidates for high-mass protostars.
Detection rates of radio sources associated with the mm dust clumps for CMCs,
CMC-IRs and HMCs are 6$\%$, 53$\%$ and 100$\%$, respectively. This result is
consistent with increasing high-mass star formation activity from CMCs to HMCs.

Interferometer observations of the CO(7-6) emission. The good knowledge of the

evidence for the quasar source to be concentric with the continuum source

measurement of the size of the continuum source, 0.76 $\pm$ 0.04 kpc FWHM,
making RX J0911.4+0551 one of the few high redshift galaxies for which the dust
and gas components are resolved with dimensions being measured. Both are found
to be very compact, the former being smaller than the latter by a factor of
$\sim$3.4$\pm$0.4. Moreover, new measurements of the CO ladder $-$ CO(10-9) and
CO(11-10) $-$ are presented that confirm the extreme narrowness of the CO line
width (107$\pm$20 km s$^{-1}$ on average). Their mere detection implies higher
temperature and/or density than for typical quasar hosts at this redshift and
suggests a possible contribution of the central AGN to gas and dust heating.
The results are interpreted in terms of current understanding of galaxy
evolution at the peak of star formation. They suggest that RX J0911.4+0551 is a
young galaxy in an early stage of its evolution, having experienced no recent

used in science and engineering. Cooley and Tukey's Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) from 1964 is a method for computing this transformation in time $O(n\log

2013 an $\Omega(n\log n)$ bound for computing the normalized Fourier Transform
assuming only unitary operations on two coordinates are allowed at each step,
and no extra memory is allowed. In 2014, Ailon then improved the result to show
that, in a $\kappa$-well conditioned computation, Fourier computation can be
sped up by no more than $O(\kappa)$. The main conjecture is that Ailon's result
can be exponentially improved, in the sense that $\kappa$-well condition cannot
admit $\omega(\log \kappa)$ speedup.
  The main result here is that `algebraic' $\kappa$-well condition admits no
more than $O(\sqrt \kappa)$ speedup. The definition of algebraic condition
number is obtained by formally viewing multiplication by constants, as
performed by the algorithm, as multiplication by indeterminates, giving rise to
computation over polynomials. The algebraic condition number is related to the
degree of these polynomials. Using the maximum modulus theorem from complex
analysis, we show that algebraic condition number upper bounds standard
condition number, and equals it in certain cases. Algebraic condition number is
an interesting measure of numerical computation stability in its own right.
Moreover, we believe that the approach of algebraic condition number has a good
chance of establishing an algebraic version of the main conjecture.

or even only a single, labeled examples of the face that we wish to recognize.
Moreover, these examples are typically corrupted by nuisance variables, both
linear (i.e., additive nuisance variables such as bad lighting, wearing of
glasses) and non-linear (i.e., non-additive pixel-wise nuisance variables such
as expression changes). The small number of labeled examples means that it is
hard to remove these nuisance variables between the training and testing faces
to obtain good recognition performance. To address the problem we propose a
method called Semi-Supervised Sparse Representation based Classification
(S$^3$RC). This is based on recent work on sparsity where faces are represented
in terms of two dictionaries: a gallery dictionary consisting of one or more
examples of each person, and a variation dictionary representing linear
nuisance variables (e.g., different lighting conditions, different glasses).
The main idea is that (i) we use the variation dictionary to characterize the
linear nuisance variables via the sparsity framework, then (ii) prototype face
images are estimated as a gallery dictionary via a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM), with mixed labeled and unlabeled samples in a semi-supervised manner, to
deal with the non-linear nuisance variations between labeled and unlabeled
samples. We have done experiments with insufficient labeled samples, even when
there is only a single labeled sample per person. Our results on the AR,
Multi-PIE, CAS-PEAL, and LFW databases demonstrate that the proposed method is
able to deliver significantly improved performance over existing methods.

find that algorithms will need to account for the local density of sources. In
particular the impact of galaxies below the detection limit warrants further
study, because magnification changes their number density, resulting in
correlations between the lensing signal and multiplicative bias. Although
achieving sub-percent accuracy will require further study, we estimate that

amplitude {\delta}(t) of the large-scale circulation (LSC) of turbulent
rotating convection within an unprecedented large Rossby number range 1<Ro<314.
Results of {\theta}(t) reveal persistent rotation of the LSC flow in the
retrograde direction over the entire Ro range. The rotation speed ratio remains
a constant of 0.13(${\pm}$0.01) for 10<Ro<70, but starts to increase with
increasing Ro when Ro>70. We identify the mechanism through which the mean
retrograde rotation speed can be enhanced by stochastic cessations in the
presence of weak Coriolis force, and show that a low-dimensional, stochastic
model provides predictions of the observed large-scale flow dynamics and
interprets its retrograde rotation.

system. Recently recurrent neural networks (RNN) obtained strong results on NLU
due to their superior ability of preserving sequential information over time.
Traditionally, the NLU module tags semantic slots for utterances considering
their flat structures, as the underlying RNN structure is a linear chain.
However, natural language exhibits linguistic properties that provide rich,
structured information for better understanding. This paper introduces a novel
model, knowledge-guided structural attention networks (K-SAN), a generalization
of RNN to additionally incorporate non-flat network topologies guided by prior
knowledge. There are two characteristics: 1) important substructures can be
captured from small training data, allowing the model to generalize to
previously unseen test data; 2) the model automatically figures out the salient
substructures that are essential to predict the semantic tags of the given
sentences, so that the understanding performance can be improved. The
experiments on the benchmark Air Travel Information System (ATIS) data show
that the proposed K-SAN architecture can effectively extract salient knowledge
from substructures with an attention mechanism, and outperform the performance
of the state-of-the-art neural network based frameworks.

incoming beam intensity by up to two orders of magnitude at the same energy
resolution. However, the propagation of the counting noise in the correlation
algorithm of data reduction is disadvantageous for the lowest intensity parts
of the observed spectrum. To mitigate this effect at pulsed neutron sources we
propose two dimensional time-of-flight recording of each neutron detection
event: with respect to both the neutron source pulses and to the rotation phase
of the pseudo-random beam modulation statistical chopper. We have identified a
formulation of the data reduction algorithm by matching the data processing
time channel width to the inherent time resolution of this chopper, which makes
the reconstruction of the direct time-of-flight spectra exact and independent
of all other contributions to instrumental resolution. Two ways are proposed
for most flexible choice of intensity vs. resolution without changing the
statistical chopper or its speed: changing the size of the beam window during
the experiment or varying intensity and resolution options in the data
reduction algorithm after the experiment. This latter is a unique and very
promising new potential offered by the correlation method. Furthermore, it
displays reduced sensitivity to external background, also due to the much
higher signal intensity. This is particularly advantageous for extending the
operational range to higher neutron energies. In hot and thermal neutron
vibrational spectroscopy, the statistical chopper approach allows us to achieve
very significant gains in spectrometer efficiency compared to using
conventional choppers. High intensity for the most intense features in the
spectra and the reduced sensitivity to sample independent background make
correlation spectroscopy a most powerful choice for studying small samples.

with non-negative highly right-skewed data as well as symmetric and heavy
tailed data and can handle continuous data with probability mass at zero. The
estimation and inference of Tweedie regression models based on the maximum
likelihood method are challenged by the presence of an infinity sum in the
probability function and non-trivial restrictions on the power parameter space.
In this paper, we propose two approaches for fitting Tweedie regression models,
namely, quasi- and pseudo-likelihood. We discuss the asymptotic properties of
the two approaches and perform simulation studies to compare our methods with
the maximum likelihood method. In particular, we show that the quasi-likelihood
method provides asymptotically efficient estimation for regression parameters.
The computational implementation of the alternative methods is faster and
easier than the orthodox maximum likelihood, relying on a simple Newton scoring
algorithm. Simulation studies showed that the quasi- and pseudo-likelihood
approaches present estimates, standard errors and coverage rates similar to the
maximum likelihood method. Furthermore, the second-moment assumptions required
by the quasi- and pseudo-likelihood methods enables us to extend the Tweedie
regression models to the class of quasi-Tweedie regression models in the
Wedderburn's style. Moreover, it allows to eliminate the non-trivial
restriction on the power parameter space, and thus provides a flexible
regression model to deal with continuous data. We provide \texttt{R}
implementation and illustrate the application of Tweedie regression models
using three data sets.

prove the existence of a novel bifurcation mechanism for the ALV equations,
where the equilibrium state can be drastically changed by flipping the
stability of a pair of fixed points. As an application, we focus on the
implications of the bifurcation mechanism for evolutionary networks; we found
that the bifurcation point can be determined quantitatively by the microscopic
quantum entanglement. The equilibrium state can be critically changed from one
type of global demographic condensation to another state that supports global
cooperation for homogeneous networks. In other words, our results indicate that
there exist a class of many-body systems where the macroscopic properties are
invariant with a certain amount of microscopic entanglement, but they can be
changed abruptly once the entanglement exceeds a critical value. Furthermore,
we provide numerical evidence showing that the emergence of bifurcation is
robust against the change of the network topologies, and the critical values
are in good agreement with our theoretical prediction. These results show that
the bifurcation mechanism could be ubiquitous in many physical systems, in

To address these issues, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations based on
atomistic force fields for systems comprised of water, air (N2 and O2), and a
Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG) substrate. Our results provide
insights into the formation/dissolution mechanisms of nanobubbles and estimates
for their density, contact angle, and surface tension. We found that the
formation of nanobubbles is driven by an initial nucleation process of air
molecules and the subsequent coalescence of the formed air clusters. The
clusters form favorably on the substrate, which provides an enhanced stability
to the clusters. In contrast, nanobubbles formed in the bulk either move
randomly to the substrate and spread or move to the water--air surface and pop
immediately. Moreover, nanobubbles consist of a condensed gaseous phase with a
surface tension smaller than that of an equivalent system under atmospheric
conditions, and contact angles larger than those in the equivalent nanodroplet
case. We anticipate that this study will provide useful insights into the
physics of nanobubbles and will stimulate further research in the field by
using all-atom simulations.

bounded away from zero. This can be done imposing some constraints on the

that uses deep convolutional neural networks to map stride-specific inertial
sensor data to the resulting stride length. The model is trained on a publicly
available and clinically relevant benchmark dataset consisting of 1220 strides
from 101 geriatric patients. Evaluation is done in a 10-fold cross validation
and for three different stride definitions. Even though best results are
achieved with strides defined from mid-stance to mid-stance with average
accuracy and precision of 0.01 $\pm$ 5.37 cm, performance does not strongly
depend on stride definition. The achieved precision outperforms
state-of-the-art methods evaluated on this benchmark dataset by 3.0 cm (36%).
Due to the independence of stride definition, the proposed method is not

state-of-the-art double integration methods. Furthermore, precision on the
benchmark dataset could be improved. With more precise mobile stride length
estimation, new insights to the progression of neurological disease or early

mechanism on Android. Although it brings the benefits such as functionality
reuse and data sharing, a threat called component hijacking is also introduced.
By hijacking a vulnerable component in victim apps, an attack app can escalate
its privilege for originally prohibited operations. Many prior studies have
been performed to understand and mitigate this issue, but component hijacking
remains a serious open problem in the Android ecosystem due to no effective
defense deployed in the wild. In this paper, we present our vision on
practically defending against component hijacking in Android apps. First, we
argue that to fundamentally prevent component hijacking, we need to switch from
the previous mindset (i.e., performing system-level control or repackaging
vulnerable apps after they are already released) to a more proactive version
that aims to help security-inexperienced developers make secure components in
the first place. To this end, we propose to embed into apps a secure component
library (SecComp), which performs in-app mandatory access control on behalf of
app components. An important factor for SecComp to be effective is that we find
it is possible to devise a set of practical in-app policies to stop component
hijacking. Furthermore, we allow developers design custom policies, beyond our
by-default generic policies, to support more fine-grained access control. We
have overcome challenges to implement a preliminary SecComp prototype, which
stops component hijacking with very low performance overhead. We hope the
future research that fully implements our vision can eventually help real-world
apps get rid of component hijacking.

information provided by wearable sensors to context-related expert features
based on deep convolutional neural networks. Regarding mobile gait analysis,
this enables integration-free and data-driven extraction of a set of 8
spatio-temporal stride parameters. To this end, two modelling approaches are
compared: A combined network estimating all parameters of interest and an
ensemble approach that spawns less complex networks for each parameter
individually. The ensemble approach is outperforming the combined modelling in
the current application. On a clinically relevant and publicly available
benchmark dataset, we estimate stride length, width and medio-lateral change in
foot angle up to ${-0.15\pm6.09}$ cm, ${-0.09\pm4.22}$ cm and ${0.13 \pm

surveys at angular resolutions below 20"". However, no comparable
high-resolution survey exists at long radio wavelengths around 21cm in line and
continuum emission. Methods: Employing the Very Large Array (VLA) in the
C-array configuration and a large program, we observe the HI 21cm line, four OH
lines, nineteen Halpha radio recombination lines as well as the continuum
emission from 1 to 2GHz in full polarization over a large part of the first
Galactic quadrant. Results: Covering Galactic longitudes from 14.5 to 67.4deg
and latitudes between +-1.25deg, we image all of these lines and the continuum
at ~20"" resolution. These data allow us to study the various components of the
interstellar medium (ISM): from the atomic phase, traced by the HI line, to the
molecular phase, observed by the OH transitions, to the ionized medium,
revealed by the cm continuum and the Halpha radio recombination lines.
Furthermore, the polarized continuum emission enables magnetic field studies.
In this overview paper, we discuss the survey outline and present the first
data release as well as early results from the different datasets. We now
release the first half of the survey; the second half will follow later after

atomic to molecular gas, and feedback from HII regions as well as the magnetic

arbitrary periodic time dependence at the special point in the parameter space

much shorter than the inverse of the Kondo temperature, an intriguing
oscillating behavior (resonance phenomenon) emerges in the time average of the

By taking the high frequency limit of the external driving, we elucidate that
the system recovers the translational invariance in time and can be described
by a mixture of the zero-temperature and infinite-temperature properties. In
certain cases, the system is governed by either the zero-temperature or
infinite-temperature properties, and therefore can be properly described by the

role in their exotic superconductivity. BaFe2As2 is one of ideal systems for
such investigation because its superconductivity can be induced in several
ways, allowing a comparative examination. Here we report a study on the spin
fluctuations of the hole-overdoped iron-based superconductors Ba1-xKxFe2As2 (x
= 0.5 and 1.0; Tc = 36 K and 3.4 K, respectively) over the entire Brillouin
zone using inelastic neutron scattering. We find that their spin spectra
consist of spin wave and chimney-like dispersions. The chimney-like dispersion
can be attributed to the itinerant character of magnetism. The band width of
the spin wave-like dispersion is almost constant from the non-doped to
optimum-doped region, which is followed by a large reduction in the overdoped
region. This suggests that the superconductivity is suppressed by the reduction
of magnetic exchange couplings, indicating a strong relationship between
magnetism and superconductivity in iron-based superconductors.

is present the problem is a classical one and much studied, and in deep water a
resonance is known to occur when $\tau=|\boldsymbol{V}|\omega_0/g$ equals the
critical value $1/4$ ($\boldsymbol{V}$: velocity of disturbance, $\omega_0$:
oscillation frequency, $g$: gravitational acceleration). We show that the

Not only does the resonant value of $\tau$ depend strongly on the angle between
$\boldsymbol{V}$ and the current's direction and the ""shear-Froude number""

tends to zero, representing the phenomenon of critical velocity for ship waves.

processes internal to the relativistic jet but also by external pair-production
absorption on the thermal emission of the accretion disc and the broad-line
region (BLR). For the first time, we compute here the pair-production opacities
in the GeV range produced by a realistic BLR accounting for the radial
stratification and radiation anisotropy. Using photoionization modelling with
the CLOUDY code, we calculate a series of BLR models of different sizes,
geometries, cloud densities, column densities and metallicities. The strongest
emission features in the model BLR are Ly$\alpha$ and HeII Ly$\alpha$.
Contribution of recombination continua is smaller, especially for hydrogen,
because Ly continuum is efficiently trapped inside the large optical depth BLR
clouds and converted to Lyman emission lines and higher-order recombination
continua. The largest effects on the gamma-ray opacity are produced by the BLR
geometry and localization of the gamma-ray source. We show that when the
gamma-ray source moves further from the central source, all the absorption
details move to higher energies and the overall level of absorption drops
because of decreasing incidence angles between the gamma-rays and BLR photons.
The observed positions of the spectral breaks can be used to measure the
geometry and the location of the gamma-ray emitting region relative to the BLR.
Strong dependence on geometry means that the soft photons dominating the
pair-production opacity may be actually produced by a different population of
BLR clouds than the bulk of the observed broad line emission.

ionized hydrogen plasma has been theoretically studied and compared with one of
the first energy loss experiments in plasmas, carried out at GSI-Darmstadt by
Hoffmann \textit{et al.} in the 90's. For this purpose, two different methods
to estimate the instantaneous charge state of the projectile have been
employed: (1) rate equations using ionization and recombination cross sections,
and (2) equilibrium charge state formulas for plasmas. Also, the equilibrium
charge state has been obtained using these ionization and recombination cross
sections, and compared with the former equilibrium formulas. The equilibrium
charge state of projectiles in plasmas is not always reached, it depends mainly
on the projectile velocity and the plasma density. Therefore, a non-equilibrium
or an instantaneous description of the projectile charge is necessary. The
charge state of projectile ions cannot be measured, except after exiting the
target, and experimental data remain very scarce. Thus, the validity of our
charge state model is checked by comparing the theoretical predictions with an
energy loss experiment, as the energy loss has a generally quadratic dependence
on the projectile charge state. The dielectric formalism has been used to
calculate the plasma stopping power including the Brandt-Kitagawa (BK) model to
describe the charge distribution of the projectile. In this charge
distribution, the instantaneous number of bound electrons instead of the
equilibrium number has been taken into account. Comparing our theoretical
predictions with experiments, it is shown the necessity of including the
instantaneous charge state and the BK charge distribution for a correct energy
loss estimation. The results also show that the initial charge state has a
strong influence in order to estimate the energy loss of the uranium ions.

(mmWave) MIMO-OFDM systems, where both the base station (BS) and the mobile
station (MS) employ large antenna arrays for directional precoding/beamforming.
Hybrid analog and digital beamforming structures are employed in order to offer
a compromise between hardware complexity and system performance. Different from
most existing studies that are concerned with narrowband channels, we consider
estimation of wideband mmWave channels with frequency selectivity, which is
more appropriate for mmWave MIMO-OFDM systems. By exploiting the sparse
scattering nature of mmWave channels, we propose a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)
decomposition-based method for channel parameter estimation (including angles
of arrival/departure, time delays, and fading coefficients). In our proposed
method, the received signal at the BS is expressed as a third-order tensor. We
show that the tensor has the form of a low-rank CP decomposition, and the
channel parameters can be estimated from the associated factor matrices. Our
analysis reveals that the uniqueness of the CP decomposition can be guaranteed
even when the size of the tensor is small. Hence the proposed method has the
potential to achieve substantial training overhead reduction. We also develop
Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) results for channel parameters, and compare our proposed
method with a compressed sensing-based method. Simulation results show that the
proposed method attains mean square errors that are very close to their
associated CRBs, and presents a clear advantage over the compressed
sensing-based method in terms of both estimation accuracy and computational
complexity.

indicators of several shock precursors in a large variety of shock front

the filament also allows us to mitigate possible artificial broadening of the

beyond its intrinsic width of $\sim$20 km/s and report it to extend over most

possible split in the narrow line. Suprathermal narrow line widths point toward
an additional heating mechanism in the form of a cosmic-ray precursor, while
the intermediate component, previously only qualitatively reported as a small
non-Gaussian contribution to the narrow component, reveals a broad-neutral

fibers by water bridging an optical tapered-coupler to a microlensed coupler.
Our water fibers are held in air and their length can be longer than a
millimeter. These hybrid fibers co-confine two important oscillations in
nature: capillary- and electromagnetic-. We optically record vibrations in the
water fiber, including an audio-rate fundamental and its 3 overtones in a
harmonic series, that one can hear in soundtracks attached. Transforming
Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems [MEMS] to Micro-Electro-Capillary-Systems
[MECS], boosts the device softness by a million to accordingly improve its
response to minute forces. Furthermore, MECS are compatible with water, which
is a most important liquid in our world.

analysis by carefully designed en-route processing. We define the Condense
architecture, its basic layers, and the interactions among its constituent
modules. Further, from the implementation side, we describe how Condense can be
integrated into the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Machine Type
Communications (MTC) architecture, as well as the prospects of making it a
practically viable technology in a short time frame, relying on Network
Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN). Finally,

density is neglected. However, we highlight the changes in the shape of the
fold induced by the film's own weight and extend the model of Diamant and
Witten [Phys.Rev.Lett. 2011, 107, 164302, arXiv:1107.5505] to understand these

breaks the up-down symmetry apparent from previous models, but elusive
experimentally. We then compress the film beyond the point of self-contact and
observe a new behaviour dependent on the film density: the single fold that
forms after wrinkling transitions into a closed loop after self-contact,
encapsulating a cylindrical droplet of the upper fluid. The encapsulated drop
either causes the loop to bend upward or to sink deeper as compression is
increased, depending on the relative buoyancy of the drop-film combination. We
propose a model to qualitatively explain this behaviour. Finally, we discuss
the relevance of the different buckling modes predicted in previous theoretical
studies and highlight the important role of surface tension in the shape of the
fold that is observed from the side -- an aspect that is usually neglected in

  A Bayesian meta-analytic approach is used to inform the phase III study with
phase II data. It is particularly attractive, since uncertainty of
between-trial heterogeneity can be dealt with probabilistically, which is
critical if the number of studies is small. Furthermore, it allows quantifying
and discounting the phase II data through the predictive distribution relevant
for phase III. A phase III design is proposed which uses the phase II data and
considers approval based on a phase III interim analysis. The design is
illustrated with a non-inferiority case study from an FDA approval in herpetic
keratitis (an orphan disease). Design operating characteristics are compared to
those of a traditional design, which ignores the phase II data.
  An analysis of the phase II data reveals good but insufficient evidence for
non-inferiority, highlighting the need for a phase III study. For the phase III
study supported by phase II data, the interim analysis is based on half of the
patients. For this design, the meta-analytic interim results are conclusive and
would justify approval. In contrast, based on the phase III data only, interim
results are inconclusive and would require further evidence.
  To accelerate drug development for orphan diseases, innovative study designs
and appropriate methodology are needed. Taking advantage of randomized phase II
data when analyzing phase III studies looks promising because the evidence from
phase II supports informed decision making. The implementation of the Bayesian

relaxation time, $T_1$ in Weyl semimetals. Since the density of states in Weyl
semimetals varies with the square of the energy around the Weyl point, a naive
power counting predicts a $1/T_1T\sim E^4$ scaling with $E$ the maximum of
temperature ($T$) and chemical potential. By carefully investigating the
hyperfine interaction between nuclear spins and Weyl fermions, we find that
while its spin part behaves conventionally, its orbital part diverges unusually
with the inverse of energy around the Weyl point. Consequently, the nuclear
spin relaxation rate scales in a graphene like manner as $1/T_1T\sim
E^2\ln(E/\omega_0)$ with $\omega_0$ the nuclear Larmor frequency. This allows
us to identify an effective hyperfine coupling constant, which is tunable by
gating or doping, which is relevant for decoherence effect in spintronics
devices and double quantum dots where hyperfine coupling is the dominant source
of spin-blockade lifting.

in the brain networks, namely, aggregated, distributed and connector hubs.
Spatially, these distinct categories of hubs were primarily located in the
default-mode system and additionally in the visual and limbic systems for
aggregated hubs, in the frontoparietal system for distributed hubs, and in the
sensorimotor and ventral attention systems for connector hubs. Importantly,
these three categories of hubs exhibited various distinct characteristics, with
the highest level of microstructural organization in the aggregated hubs, the
largest wiring cost and topological vulnerability in the distributed hubs, and
the highest functional associations and cognitive flexibility in the connector
hubs, although they behaved better regarding these characteristics compared to
non-hubs. Finally, all three categories of hub indices displayed high
across-session spatial similarities and acted as a structural fingerprint with
high predictive rates (100%, 100% and 84.2%) for individual identification.
Collectively, our findings highlighted three categories of brain hubs with
differential microstructural, functional and cognitive associations, which may

identification of home and work locations of anonymized individuals, which
enable to construct Origin-Destination (OD) matrices of commuting flows. Our
analysis reveal that the uncertainty of results highly depends on the sample
size, the scale and the period of the year at which the data were gathered.
Nevertheless, the spatial distributions of land use computed for different
samples are remarkably robust: on average, we observe more than 75% of shared
surface area between the different spatial partitions when considering activity
of at least 100,000 users whatever the scale. The OD matrix is less stable and
depends on the scale with a share of at least 75% of commuters in common when
considering all types of flows constructed from the home-work locations of
100,000 users. For both tasks, better results can be obtained at larger levels
of aggregation or by considering more users. These results confirm that ICT

enhancement and other differences between centrals and satellites, such as
their star formation rates, gas content, and growth history, we study the
metallicities of >3600 galaxies with M_star > 10^10 M_sun in the cosmological
hydrodynamical EAGLE 100 Mpc `Reference' simulation, including ~1500 in the
vicinity of galaxy groups and clusters (M_200 >= 10^13 M_sun). The simulation
predicts excess gas and stellar metallicities in satellites consistent with
observations, except for stellar metallicities at M_star <~ 10^10.2 M_sun where
the predicted excess is smaller than observed. The exact magnitude of the
effect depends on galaxy selection, aperture, and on whether the metallicity is
weighted by stellar mass or luminosity. The stellar metallicity excess in
clusters is also sensitive to the efficiency scaling of star formation
feedback. We identify stripping of low-metallicity gas from the galaxy
outskirts, as well as suppression of metal-poor inflows towards the galaxy
centre, as key drivers of the enhancement of gas metallicity. Stellar
metallicities in satellites are higher than in the field as a direct
consequence of the more metal-rich star forming gas, whereas stripping of stars
and suppressed stellar mass growth, as well as differences in accreted vs.
in-situ star formation between satellites and the field, are of secondary
importance.

of textured and isotropic
$\mathrm{Nd}_2\mathrm{Fe}_{14}\mathrm{B}/\alpha$-$\mathrm{Fe}$ nanocomposites
using magnetometry, transmission electron microscopy, synchrotron x-ray
diffraction, and, in particular, magnetic small-angle neutron scattering
(SANS). Analysis of the magnetic neutron data of the textured specimen and
computation of the correlation function of the spin misalignment SANS cross
section suggests the existence of inhomogeneously magnetized regions on an
intraparticle nanometer length scale, about $40-50 \, \mathrm{nm}$ in the
remanent state. Possible origins for this spin disorder are discussed: it may
originate in thin grain-boundary layers (where the materials parameters are
different than in the $\mathrm{Nd}_2\mathrm{Fe}_{14}\mathrm{B}$ grains), or it
may reflect the presence of crystal defects (introduced via hot pressing), or
the dispersion in the orientation distribution of the magnetocrystalline
anisotropy axes of the $\mathrm{Nd}_2\mathrm{Fe}_{14}\mathrm{B}$ grains. X-ray
powder diffraction data reveal a crystallographic texture in the direction
perpendicular to the pressing direction -- a finding which might be related to
the presence of a texture in the magnetization distribution, as inferred from
the magnetic SANS data.

fully the physical equations of motion, in which the string cores shrink in

galaxy mass. The formation histories, and thus ages, of dark matter halos
correlate with their large-scale density $\rho$, an effect known as assembly
bias. We test whether this correlation extends to galaxies by measuring the
dependence of galaxy stellar age on $\rho$. To clarify the comparison between
theory and observation, and to remove the strong environmental effects on
satellites, we use galaxy group catalogs to identify central galaxies and
measure their quenched fraction, $f_Q$, as a function of large-scale
environment. Models that match halo age to central galaxy age predict a strong
positive correlation between $f_Q$ and $\rho$. However, we show that the
amplitude of this effect depends on the definition of halo age: assembly bias
is significantly reduced when removing the effects of splashback halos---those
halos that are central but have passed through a larger halo or experienced
strong tidal encounters. Defining age using halo mass at its peak value rather
than current mass removes these effects. In SDSS data, at M$_{\rm gal}\gtrsim
10^{10.0}$ M_sol/h$^2$, there is a $\sim 5\%$ increase in $f_Q$ from low to
high densities, which is in agreement with predictions of dark matter halos
using peak halo mass. At lower stellar mass there is little to no correlation
of $f_Q$ with $\rho$. For these galaxies, age-matching is inconsistent with the
data across the wide range the halo formation metrics that we tested. This
implies that halo formation history has a small but statistically significant
impact on quenching of star formation at high masses, while the quenching
process in low-mass central galaxies is uncorrelated with halo formation
history.

  Image Recognition","13 pages, 13 figures, Accepted for publication in IEEE TCAD, 2017",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine-learning algorithms have shown outstanding image recognition or
classification performance for computer vision applications. However, the
compute and energy requirement for implementing such classifier models for
large-scale problems is quite high. In this paper, we propose Feature Driven
Selective Classification (FALCON) inspired by the biological visual attention
mechanism in the brain to optimize the energy-efficiency of machine-learning
classifiers. We use the consensus in the characteristic features
(color/texture) across images in a dataset to decompose the original
classification problem and construct a tree of classifiers (nodes) with a
generic-to-specific transition in the classification hierarchy. The initial
nodes of the tree separate the instances based on feature information and
selectively enable the latter nodes to perform object specific classification.
The proposed methodology allows selective activation of only those branches and
nodes of the classification tree that are relevant to the input while keeping
the remaining nodes idle. Additionally, we propose a programmable and scalable
Neuromorphic Engine (NeuE) that utilizes arrays of specialized neural
computational elements to execute the FALCON based classifier models for
diverse datasets. The structure of FALCON facilitates the reuse of nodes while
scaling up from small classification problems to larger ones thus allowing us
to construct classifier implementations that are significantly more efficient.
We evaluate our approach for a 12-object classification task on the Caltech101
dataset and 10-object task on CIFAR-10 dataset by constructing FALCON models on
the NeuE platform in 45nm technology. Our results demonstrate significant
improvement in energy-efficiency and training time for minimal loss in output
quality.

single clinical outcome on many genetic variants one by one, but there is an
increasing demand for joint analysis of many molecular outcomes and genetic
variants in order to unravel functional interactions. Unfortunately, most
existing approaches to joint modelling are either too simplistic to be powerful
or are impracticable for computational reasons. Inspired by Richardson et al.
(2010, Bayesian Statistics 9), we consider a sparse multivariate regression
model that allows simultaneous selection of predictors and associated
responses. As Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference on such models can be
prohibitively slow when the number of genetic variants exceeds a few thousand,
we propose a variational inference approach which produces posterior
information very close to that of MCMC inference, at a much reduced
computational cost. Extensive numerical experiments show that our approach
outperforms popular variable selection methods and tailored Bayesian
procedures, dealing within hours with problems involving hundreds of thousands
of genetic variants and tens to hundreds of clinical or molecular outcomes.

mass accretion onto protostars. They are known as the so-called FU Orionis
phenomenon in the context of low-mass protostars. More recently, this process

radiation hydrodynamics simulations, we stress that present-day forming massive
stars also experience variable accretion and show that this process is
accompanied by luminous outbursts induced by the episodic accretion of gaseous
clumps falling from the circumstellar disk onto the protostar. Consequently,
the process of accretion-induced luminous flares is also conceivable in the
high-mass regime of star formation and we propose to regard this phenomenon as
a general mechanism that can affect protostars regardless of their mass and/or
the chemical properties of the parent environment in which they form. In
addition to the commonness of accretion-driven outbursts in the star formation
machinery, we conjecture that luminous flares from regions hosting forming
high-mass star may be an observational implication of the fragmentation of
their accretion disks.

noise. As most stars in the Gaia catalogue will have non-negligible fractional
parallax errors, we must treat distance estimation as a constrained inference
problem. Here we investigate the performance of various priors for estimating
distances, using a simulated Gaia catalogue of one billion stars. We use three
minimalist, isotropic priors, as well an anisotropic prior derived from the
observability of stars in a Milky Way model. The two priors that assume a
uniform distribution of stars--either in distance or in space density---give
poor results: The root mean square fractional distance error, f_RMS, grows far
in excess of 100% once the fractional parallax error, f_true, is larger than
0.1. A prior assuming an exponentially decreasing space density with increasing
distance performs well once its single scale length parameter has been set to
an appropriate value: f_RMS is roughly equal to f_true for f_true < 0.4, yet
does not increase further as f_true increases up to to 1.0. The Milky Way prior
performs well except towards the Galactic centre, due to a mismatch with the
(simulated) data. Such mismatches will be inevitable (and remain unknown) in
real applications, and can produce large errors. We therefore suggest to adopt
the simpler exponentially decreasing space density prior, which is also less
time-consuming to compute. Including Gaia photometry improves the distance
estimation significantly for both the Milky Way and exponentially decreasing
space density prior, yet doing so requires additional assumptions about the
physical nature of stars.

spectra and seven with flat radio spectra. A total of 25 radio jet features are
present in this sample. We apply a Bayesian multi-scale image reconstruction
method to detect and measure the X-ray emission from the jets. We compute
deviations from a baseline model that does not include the jet, and compare
observed X-ray images with those computed with simulated images where no jet
features exist. This allows us to compute p-value upper bounds on the
significance that an X- ray jet is detected in a pre-determined region of
interest. We detected 12 of the features unambiguously, and an additional 6
marginally. We also find residual emission in the cores of 3 quasars and in the
background of 1 quasar that suggest the existence of unresolved X-ray jets. The
dependence of the X-ray to radio luminosity ratio on redshift is a potential
diagnostic of the emission mechanism, since the inverse Compton scattering of
cosmic microwave background photons (IC/CMB) is thought to be redshift
dependent, whereas in synchrotron models no clear redshift dependence is
expected. We find that the high-redshift jets have X-ray to radio flux ratios
that are marginally inconsistent with those from lower redshifts, suggesting
that either the X-ray emissions is due to the IC/CMB rather than the
synchrotron process, or that high redshift jets are qualitatively different.

distributions of interest by carefully combining sequential Monte Carlo methods
with methodology for the exact simulation of diffusions. The methodology
introduced here is particularly promising in that it is applicable to the same
class of problems as gradient based Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms but
entirely circumvents the need to conduct Metropolis-Hastings type accept/reject
steps whilst retaining exactness: the paper gives theoretical guarantees
ensuring the algorithm has the correct limiting target distribution.
Furthermore, this methodology is highly amenable to big data problems. By
employing a modification to existing na{\""\i}ve sub-sampling and control

heterogeneous knowledge sources in a modular and very general way. They were,
however, mainly designed for static scenarios and are therefore not well-suited
for dynamic environments in which continuous reasoning over such heterogeneous
knowledge with constantly arriving streams of data is necessary. In this paper,
we introduce reactive multi-context systems (rMCSs), a framework for reactive
reasoning in the presence of heterogeneous knowledge sources and data streams.
We show that rMCSs are indeed well-suited for this purpose by illustrating how
several typical problems arising in the context of stream reasoning can be
handled using them, by showing how inconsistencies possibly occurring in the
integration of multiple knowledge sources can be handled, and by arguing that
the potential non-determinism of rMCSs can be avoided if needed using an
alternative, more skeptical well-founded semantics instead with beneficial
computational properties. We also investigate the computational complexity of
various reasoning problems related to rMCSs. Finally, we discuss related work,
and show that rMCSs do not only generalize mMCSs to dynamic settings, but also
capture/extend relevant approaches w.r.t. dynamics in knowledge representation

time after surgery. The motivation for our research comes from a study which
includes patients who received a human tissue valve in the aortic position.
These patients are followed prospectively over time by standardized
echocardiographic assessment of valve function. Loss of follow-up could be
caused by valve intervention or the death of the patient. One of the main
characteristics of the human valve is that its durability is limited.
Therefore, it is of interest to obtain a prognostic model in order for the
physicians to scan trends in valve function over time and plan their next
intervention, accounting for the characteristics of the data.
  Several authors have focused on deriving predictions under the standard joint
modeling of longitudinal and survival data framework that assumes a constant
effect for the coefficient that links the longitudinal and survival outcomes.
However, in our case this may be a restrictive assumption. Since the valve
degenerates, the association between the biomarker with survival may change
over time.
  To improve dynamic predictions we propose a Bayesian joint model that allows
a time-varying coefficient to link the longitudinal and the survival processes,
using P-splines. We evaluate the performance of the model in terms of
discrimination and calibration, while accounting for censoring.

maximum occurs when the mass donor star is aligned with the bulge of the
elliptical disc. The accretion disc is geometrically thin both in outburst and
in quiescence; it fills the primary Roche lobe in outburst and shrinks to about
half this size in quiescence. The stability of the eclipse shape, width and
depth along quiescence and the derived disc surface brightness distribution
indicate that the quiescent accretion disc is in a high-viscosity,
steady-state. Flickering mapping of the quiescent data reveal that the
low-frequency flickering arises from an azimuthally-extended stream-disc impact
region at disc rim and from the innermost disc region, whereas the
high-frequency flickering originates in the accretion disc. Assuming the
disc-related flickering to be caused by fluctuations in the energy dissipation
rate induced by magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence (Gertseema & Achterberg 1992),
we find that the quiescent disc viscosity parameter is large (alpha ~ 0.2-0.4)
at all radii. The high-viscosity quiescent disc and the inferred low disc
temperatures in superoutburst are inconsistent with expectations of the
disc-instability model, and lead to the conclusion that the outbursts of V4140
Sgr are powered by mass transfer bursts from its donor star.

order to disentangle interesting and peculiar hadron contributions in the

emitters, it is crucial to fully constrain lepton contributions first through
radio-observed parameters. In particular, the Bremsstrahlung and Inverse

and cut-off in the radio domain. Since these parameters vary for different SNR
regions and electron populations, spatially-resolved radio spectra are then
required for accurate multi-wavelength modelling.

elevates algorithmically-derived choices and decisions to a, and perhaps the,
central concern regarding technical autonomy in war. We thereby aim to shed
light on and recast the discussion regarding autonomous weapon systems. We
define war algorithm as any algorithm that is expressed in computer code, that
is effectuated through a constructed system, and that is capable of operating
in relation to armed conflict. In introducing this concept, our foundational
technological concern is the capability of a constructed system, without
further human intervention, to help make and effectuate a decision or choice of
a war algorithm. Distilled, the two core ingredients are an algorithm expressed
in computer code and a suitably capable constructed system. Through that lens,
we link international law and related accountability architectures to relevant
technologies. We sketch a three-part (non-exhaustive) approach that highlights
traditional and unconventional accountability avenues. We focus largely on
international law because it is the only normative regime that purports, in key
respects but with important caveats, to be both universal and uniform. By not
limiting our inquiry only to weapon systems, we take an expansive view, showing
how the broad concept of war algorithms might be susceptible to regulation, and
how those algorithms might already fit within the existing regulatory system

magnetic field can exhibit a rate-independent or rate-dependent hysteresis. An
energy dissipation rate in a superconductor placed in a time-varying magnetic
field depends on its wave form and type of hysteresis, which depends on
temperature. The same wave form may reduce the energy dissipation rate in the
case of true hysteresis, while it may increase the energy dissipation rate in
the case of dynamic hysteresis compared with an energy dissipation rate in a
pure sinusoidal field. We present experimental data which confirm the energy
dissipation rate calculated using the critical state theory for the case of
rate-independent hysteresis and limiting behavior in a normal state for the
case of rate-dependent hysteresis.

account the issue of gauge invariance in noncommutative space, we incorporate
the Seiberg-Witten map in our analysis. Generalised Bopp-shift transformation
is then used to map the noncommutative system to its commutative equivalent
system. In particular we have computed the partition function of the system and
from this we obtained the susceptibility of the Landau system and found that
the result gets modified by the spatial noncommutative parameter $\theta$. We
also investigate the de Hass--van Alphen effect in noncommutative space and
observe that the oscillation of the magnetization and the susceptibility gets
noncommutative corrections. Interestingly, the susceptibility in the
noncommutative scenario is non-zero in the range of the magnetic field greater
than the threshold value which is in contrast to its commutative counterpart.
The results obtained are valid upto all orders in the noncommutative parameter
$\theta$.

high energies. Spectra of heavy ions in many large SEP events show features
such as roll-overs or spectral breaks. In some events when the spectra are
plotted in energy/nucleon they can be shifted relative to each other to make
the spectral breaks align. The amount of shift is charge-to-mass ratio (Q/A)
dependent and varies from event to event. This can be understood if the spectra
of heavy ions are organized by the diffusion coefficients (Cohen et al., 2005).
In the work of Li et al. (2009), the Q/A dependences of the scaling is related
to shock geometry when the CME-driven shock is close to the Sun. For events
where multiple in-situ spacecraft observations exist, one may expect that
different spacecraft are connected to different portions of the CME-driven
shock that have different shock geometries, therefore yielding different Q/A
dependence. In this work, we examine one SEP event which occurred on 2013
November 4. We study the Q/A dependence of the energy scaling for heavy ion
spectra using Helium, oxygen, and iron ions. Observations from STEREO-A,
STEREO-B and ACE are examined. We find that the scalings are different for
different spacecraft. We suggest that this is because ACE, STEREO-A and STEREO-
B are connected to different parts of the shock that have different shock
geometries. Our analysis indicates that studying the Q/A scaling of in-situ
particle spectra can serve as a powerful tool to remotely examine the shock
geometry for large SEP events.

which could be utilized to predict the missing edges or identify the spurious
edges, and attracts much attention from various fields. The key issue of link
prediction is to estimate the likelihood of two nodes in networks. Most current
approaches of link prediction base on static structural analysis and ignore the
temporal aspects of evolving networks. Unlike previous work, in this paper, we
propose a popularity based structural perturbation method (PBSPM) that
characterizes the similarity of an edge not only from existing connections of
networks, but also from the popularity of its two endpoints, since popular
nodes have much more probability to form links between themselves. By taking
popularity of nodes into account, PBSPM could suppress nodes that have high
importance, but gradually become inactive. Therefore the proposed method is
inclined to predict potential edges between active nodes, rather than edges
between inactive nodes. Experimental results on four real networks show that
the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both in accuracy
and robustness in evolving networks.

  Non-parametric Generalized Reflectivity Model",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents an efficient algorithm of high-resolution microwave
imaging based on the concept of generalized reflectivity. The contribution made
in this paper is two-fold. We introduce the concept of non-parametric
generalized reflectivity (GR, for short) as a function of operational
frequencies and view angles, etc. The GR extends the conventional Born-based
imaging model, i.e., single-scattering model, into that accounting for more
realistic interaction between the electromagnetic wavefield and imaged scene.
Afterwards, the GR-based microwave imaging is formulated in the convex of
sparsity-regularized optimization. Typically, the sparsity-regularized
optimization requires the implementation of iterative strategy, which is
computationally expensive, especially for large-scale problems. To break this
bottleneck, we convert the imaging problem into the problem of physics-driven
image processing by introducing a dual transformation. Moreover, this image
processing is performed over overlapping patches, which can be efficiently
solved in the parallel or distributed manner. In this way, the proposed
high-resolution imaging methodology could be applicable to large-scale
microwave imaging problems. Selected simulation results are provided to
demonstrate the state-of-art performance of proposed methodology.

devices, a Fuzzy Logic based implicit authentication scheme is proposed in this
paper. The proposed scheme computes an aggregate score based on selected
features and a threshold in real-time based on current and historic data
depicting user routine. The tuned fuzzy system is then applied to the
aggregated score and the threshold to determine the trust level of the current
user. The proposed fuzzy-integrated implicit authentication scheme is designed
to: operate adaptively and completely in the background, require minimal
training period, enable high system accuracy while provide timely detection of
abnormal activity. In this paper, we explore Fuzzy Logic based authentication
in depth. Gaussian and triangle-based membership functions are investigated and
compared using real data over several weeks from different Android phone users.
The presented results show that our proposed Fuzzy Logic approach is a highly
effective, and viable scheme for lightweight real-time implicit authentication
on mobile devices.
