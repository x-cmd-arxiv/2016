information-theoretic tools, based on network spectral properties, such as
Renyi q-entropy, generalized Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon divergences,
the latter allowing us to define a natural distance measure between complex

between an observed network and a parametric network model, inference of model

model selection can be performed appropriate information criteria. Second, we
show that the information-theoretic metric quantifies the distance between
pairs of networks and we can use it, for instance, to cluster the layers of a
multilayer system. By applying this framework to networks corresponding to
sites of the human microbiome, we perform hierarchical cluster analysis and
recover with high accuracy existing community-based associations. Our results

ever in the oil and gas industry. Although the fractures are small, the high
injection rate and low viscosity of the water, lead to high Reynolds numbers
and potentially turbulence in the fracture. Here we present a semi-analytical
solution for a blade-shaped (PKN) geometry hydraulic fracture driven by a
turbulent fluid in the limit of zero fluid leak-off to the formation. We model
the turbulence in the PKN fracture using the Gaukler-Manning-Strickler
parametrization, which relates the the flow rate of the water to the pressure
gradient along the fracture. The key parameter in this relation is the
Darcy-Weisbach friction factor for the roughness of the crack wall. Coupling
this turbulence parametrization with conservation of mass allows us to write a
nonlinear pde for the crack width as a function of space and time. By way of a
similarity ansatz, we obtain a semi-analytical solution using an orthogonal
polynomial series. Embedding the asymptotic behavior near the fracture tip into
the polynomial series, we find very rapid convergence: a suitably accurate
solution is obtained with two terms of the series. This closed-form solution
facilitates clear comparisons between the results and parameters for laminar
and turbulent hydraulic fractures. In particular, it resolves one of the well
known problems whereby calibration of models to data has difficulty
simultaneously matching the hydraulic fracture length and wellbore pressure.

the study of both condensed matter systems and gravitational systems. It not
only plays a key role in investigating the holographic duality between a
strongly interacting quantum system and a gravitational system, but also
diagnoses the chaotic behavior of many-body quantum systems and characterizes
the information scrambling. Based on the OTOCs, three different concepts --
quantum chaos, holographic duality, and information scrambling -- are found to
be intimately related to each other. Despite of its theoretical importance, the
experimental measurement of the OTOC is quite challenging and so far there is
no experimental measurement of the OTOC for local operators. Here we report the
measurement of OTOCs of local operators for an Ising spin chain on a nuclear
magnetic resonance quantum simulator. We observe that the OTOC behaves
differently in the integrable and non-integrable cases. Based on the recent
discovered relationship between OTOCs and the growth of entanglement entropy in
the many-body system, we extract the entanglement entropy from the measured
OTOCs, which clearly shows that the information entropy oscillates in time for
integrable models and scrambles for non-intgrable models. With the measured
OTOCs, we also obtain the experimental result of the butterfly velocity, which
measures the speed of correlation propagation. Our experiment paves a way for
experimentally studying quantum chaos, holographic duality, and information
scrambling in many-body quantum systems with quantum simulators.

logarithmic discretization intervals. We demonstrate that the adaptive
broadening better resolves various features in non-interacting and interacting
models at comparable computational cost. The resolution enhancement is more
significant for coarser discretization as typically required in multi-band
calculations. At low frequency below the energy scale of temperature, the
discrete NRG data necessarily needs to be broadened on a linear scale. Here we
provide a method that minimizes transition artefacts in between these

particles is presented. The model consists of a finite collection of modes that
can be occupied by N particles, either bosons or fermions. Measurement
scenarios allow one to measure occupation of each mode in at least two
different measurement contexts. The system is said to be non-contextual if the
occupation numbers can be assigned to modes in each measurement scenario. The
assignment is done under the non-contextuality assumption, i.e., an occupation
number assigned to a mode does not depend on a scenario in which this mode is
measured. In addition, the total number of particles has to be conserved,
therefore the sum of occupation numbers in each measurement context is equal to
N. For N=1 the model does not differ from the standard contextuality scenario.
However, for N>1 the problem reveals new complex features. In particular, it is
shown that a type of contextuality exhibited by the system (state-dependent,
state-independent, or non-contextual) depends on the type and the number of
particles. Further properties of this model and open problems are also
discussed.

commensurability (m integer). While capture into Lindblad Eccentric Resonances
(where the perturber's orbit is circular) has been investigated years ago,
capture into CER (where the perturber's orbit is elliptic) has not yet been
investigated in detail. Here, we derive the generic equations of motion near a
CER in the general case where both the perturber and the test particle migrate.
We derive the probability of capture in that context, and we examine more
closely two particular cases: (i) if only the perturber is migrating, capture
is possible only if the migration is outward from the primary. Notably, the
probability of capture is independent of the way the perturber migrates
outward; (ii) if only the test particle is migrating, then capture is possible
only if the algebraic value of its migration rate is a decreasing function of
orbital radius. In this case, the probability of capture is proportional to the
radial gradient of migration. These results differ from the capture into
Lindblad Eccentric Resonance (LER), where it is necessary that the orbits of
the perturber and the test particle converge for capture to be possible.
Possible applications for planetary satellites are discussed.

these films are deposited within the transition from metallic to compound

interplanetary plasmas, supernovae, ocean waves, and financial markets. Despite

the frame where gravity is de-mixed from the scalar this is due to disformal
couplings of matter species to the gravitational sector, with disformal
coefficients that depend on the gradient of the scalar field. In the frame
where matter is minimally coupled, it originates from the so-called beyond
Horndeski quadratic Lagrangian. We extend the Effective Theory of Interacting
Dark Energy by allowing disformal coupling coefficients to depend on the
gradient of the scalar field as well. In this very general approach, we derive
the conditions to avoid ghost and gradient instabilities and we define Kinetic
Matter Mixing independently of the frame metric used to described the action.
We study its phenomenological consequences for a $\Lambda$CDM background
evolution, first analytically on small scales. Then, we compute the matter
power spectrum and the angular spectra of the CMB anisotropies and the CMB
lensing potential, on all scales. We employ the public version of COOP, a
numerical Einstein-Boltzmann solver that implements very general scalar-tensor
modifications of gravity. Rather uniquely, Kinetic Matter Mixing weakens
gravity on short scales, predicting a lower $\sigma_8$ with respect to the

  A heuristic is developed to mitigate any loss of information, which might set
in when parameters are estimated first and then the valuations are performed,
by directly calculating valuations using the historical time series. This

  MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stx1208",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Only in the Milky Way is it possible to conduct an experiment which uses
stellar streams to detect low-mass dark matter subhaloes. In smooth and static
host potentials, tidal tails of disrupting satellites appear highly symmetric.
However, perturbations from dark subhaloes, as well as from GMCs and the Milky
Way bar, can induce density fluctuations that destroy this symmetry. Motivated
by the recent release of unprecedentedly deep and wide imaging data around the
Pal~5 stellar stream, we develop a new probabilistic, adaptive and
non-parametric technique which allows us to bring the cluster's tidal tails
into clear focus. Strikingly, we uncover a stream whose density exhibits
visible changes on a variety of angular scales. We detect significant bumps and
dips, both narrow and broad: two peaks on either side of the progenitor, each
only a fraction of a degree across, and two gaps, $\sim2^{\circ}$ and
$\sim9^{\circ}$ wide, the latter accompanied by a gargantuan lump of debris.
This largest density feature results in a pronounced inter-tail asymmetry which
cannot be made consistent with an unperturbed stream according to a suite of
simulations we have produced. We conjecture that the sharp peaks around Pal 5
are epicyclic overdensities, while the two dips are consistent with impacts by
subhaloes. Assuming an age of 3.4 Gyr for Pal 5, these two gaps would
correspond to the characteristic size of gaps created by subhaloes in the mass
range of $10^6-10^7 M_\odot$ and $10^7-10^8 M_\odot$ respectively. In addition
to dark substructure, we find that the bar of the Milky Way can plausibly
produce the asymmetric density seen in Pal 5 and that GMCs could cause the
smaller gap.

fainter than the progenitor in the optical. The mid-IR flux has slowly
decreased to the lowest levels since the first measurements in 2004. There is
faint ($2000-3000~L_{\odot}$) near-IR emission likely associated with the
source. We find the late-time evolution of the source to be inconsistent with
obscuration from an ejected, dusty shell. Models of the spectral energy
distribution indicate that the remaining bolometric luminosity is $>6$ times
fainter than that of the progenitor and is decreasing as $\sim t^{-4/3}$. We
conclude that the transient is unlikely to be a SN impostor or stellar merger.
The event is consistent with the ejection of the envelope of a red supergiant
in a failed SN and the late-time emission could be powered by fallback
accretion onto a newly-formed black hole. Future IR and X-ray observations are
needed to confirm this interpretation of the fate for the star.

astrophysics, black holes and compact matter distributions have also assumed a
central role in many other branches of physics. These applications often
involve spacetimes with $D>4$ dimensions where the calculation of gravitational
waves is more involved than in the four dimensional case, but has now become
possible thanks to substantial progress in the theoretical study of general

hole X-ray binary V404 Cyg obtained during its summer 2015 outburst, primarily
focusing on observations during the height of this outburst activity. The
$NuSTAR$ data show extreme variability in both the flux and spectral properties
of the source. This is partly driven by strong and variable line-of-sight
absorption, similar to previous outbursts. The latter stages of this
observation are dominated by strong flares, reaching luminosities close to
Eddington. During these flares, the central source appears to be relatively
unobscured and the data show clear evidence for a strong contribution from
relativistic reflection, providing a means to probe the geometry of the
innermost accretion flow. Based on the flare properties, analogy with other
Galactic black hole binaries, and also the simultaneous onset of radio
activity, we argue that this intense X-ray flaring is related to transient jet
activity during which the ejected plasma is the primary source of illumination
for the accretion disk. If this is the case, then our reflection modelling
implies that these jets are launched in close proximity to the black hole (as
close as a few gravitational radii), consistent with expectations for jet
launching models that tap either the spin of the central black hole, or the
very innermost accretion disk. Our analysis also allows us to place the first
constraints on the black hole spin for this source, which we find to be $a^* >

however, an alternative interpretation based on the multiple population

(G2), while the faint RC is representing first-generation stars (G1) with
normal helium abundance. Here our RC models are constructed in a large
parameter space to see the effects of metallicity, age, and helium abundance on
the double RC feature. Our models show that the luminosity of RC stars is
mainly affected by helium abundance, while the RC color is primarily affected
by metallicity. The effect of age is relatively small, unless it is older than
12 Gyr or much younger than 6 Gyr. The observed double RC feature can therefore
be reproduced in a relatively large parameter space, once {\Delta}Y between G2

refinement (AMR) simulations of isolated dwarf and L-star disk galaxies with
20-40 pc resolution. The models are thermal dump, stochastic thermal,
'mechanical' (injecting energy or momentum depending on the resolution),
kinetic, and delayed cooling feedback. We focus on the ability of each model to
suppress star formation and generate outflows. Our highest-resolution runs
marginally resolve the adiabatic phase of the feedback events, which correspond
to 40 SN explosions, and the first three models yield nearly identical results,
possibly indicating that kinetic and delayed cooling feedback converge to wrong
results. At lower resolution all models differ, with thermal dump feedback
becoming inefficient. Thermal dump, stochastic, and mechanical feedback
generate multiphase outflows with mass loading factors $\beta \ll 1$, which is
much lower than observed. For the case of stochastic feedback we compare to
published SPH simulations, and find much lower outflow rates. Kinetic feedback
yields fast, hot outflows with $\beta\sim 1$, but only if the wind is in effect
hydrodynamically decoupled from the disk by using a large bubble radius.
Delayed cooling generates cold, dense and slow winds with $\beta> 1$, but large
amounts of gas occupy regions of temperature-density space with short cooling
times. We conclude that either our resolution is too low to warrant physically
motivated models for SN feedback, that feedback mechanisms other than SNe are
important, or that other aspects of galaxy evolution, such as star formation,
require better treatment.

lie on the size-magnitude and $\sigma$-luminosity relations for previously
studied dwarf galaxies. Just six ($15\pm5.7$ per cent) are found to have
rotation speeds $v_{e,rot} < 15$ km s$^{-1}$ at $\sim1$ $R_{e}$, and may be
dominated by pressure support at all radii. Two galaxies in our sample have
kinematically distinct cores in their stellar component, likely the result of
accretion. Six contain ionised gas despite not hosting ongoing star formation,
and this gas is typically kinematically misaligned from their stellar
component. This is the first large-scale Integral Field Unit (IFU) study of low

gaseous content set by the combined effects of cosmic reionization, which
imposes a mass-dependent upper limit, and of ram pressure stripping, which
reduces it further in high-density regions. Halos mainly affected by
reionization (RELHICs; REionization-Limited HI Clouds) inhabit preferentially
low-density regions and make up a population where the gas is in hydrostatic
equilibrium with the dark matter potential and in thermal equilibrium with the
ionizing UV background. Their thermodynamic properties are well specified, and
their gas density and temperature profiles may be predicted in detail. Gas in
RELHICs is nearly fully ionized but with neutral cores that span a large range
of HI masses and column densities and have negligible non-thermal broadening.
We present predictions for their characteristic sizes and central column
densities: the massive tail of the distribution should be within reach of
future blind HI surveys. Local Group RELHICs (LGRs) have some properties
consistent with observed Ultra Compact High Velocity Clouds (UCHVCs) but the
sheer number of the latter suggests that most UCHVCs are not RELHICs. Our
results suggest that LGRs (i) should typically be beyond 500 kpc from the Milky
Way or M31; (ii) have positive Galactocentric radial velocities; (iii) HI sizes
not exceeding 1 kpc, and (iv) should be nearly round. The detection and
characterization of RELHICs would offer a unique probe of the small-scale

reconstruct the global and radial stellar mass growth histories (MGHs) of an

confirm that the main driver of the global MGHs is mass, with more massive
galaxies assembling their masses earlier (downsizing), though for a given mass,
the global MGHs segregate by color, specific star formation rate (sSFR), and
morphological type. From the inferred radial mean MGHs, we find that at the
late evolutionary stages (or for fractions of assembled mass larger than ~
80%), the innermost regions formed stars on average earlier than the outermost
ones (inside-out). At earlier epochs, when the age resolution of the method
becomes poor, the mass assembly seems to be spatially homogeneous or even in
the outside-in mode, specially for the red/quiescent/early-type galaxies. The
innermost MGHs are in general more regular (less scatter around the mean) than
the outermost ones. For dwarf and low-mass galaxies, we do not find evidence of
an outside-in formation mode; instead their radial MGHs are very diverse most
of the time, with periods of outside- in and inside-out modes (or strong radial
migration), suggesting this an episodic SF history. Blue/star-forming/late-type
galaxies present on average a significantly more pronounced inside-out
formation mode than red/quiescent/early-type galaxies, independently of mass.
We discuss our results in the light of the processes of galaxy formation,
quenching, and radial migration. We discuss also on the uncertainties and
biases of the fossil record method and how they could affect our results.

well-known dynamical processes (e.g. spiral structure and bar instabilities)
increase the dark matter density in the disk plane. We find that the magnitude
of the combined stellar and shadow bar evolution, when isolated from the effect
of the axisymmetric gravitational potential of the disk, accounts for >30% of

of previously claimed deviations from the standard halo model. The dark-matter

which consists of balancing the vacuum energy in Scherk-Schwarzed theories
against contributions coming from non- perturbative physics. Universality of
threshold corrections ensures that, in such situations, the stable minimum will
have consistent gauge couplings for any gauge group that shares the same N = 2
beta function for the bulk excitations as the gauge group that takes part in
the minimisation. Scherk- Schwarz compactification from 6D to 4D in heterotic
strings is discussed explicitly, together with two alternative possibilities
for the non-perturbative physics, namely metastable SQCD vacua and a single
gaugino condensate. In the former case, it is shown that modular symmetries
gives various consistency checks, and allow one to follow soft-terms, playing a
similar role to R-symmetry in global SQCD. The latter case is particularly
attractive when there is nett Bose-Fermi degeneracy in the massless sector. In
such cases, because the original Casimir energy is generated entirely by
excited and/or non-physical string modes, it is completely immune to the
non-perturbative IR physics. The large separation between UV and IR
contributions to the potential greatly simplifies the analysis of
stabilisation, and is a general possibility that has not been considered
before.

Kepler} telescope as part of {\it K2} Campaign 6. The photometric time series
has one-minute time sampling and a precision of about 690~ppm, after filtering
out artifacts and spurious trends. We identify dozens of starspot-crossing
events, when the planet eclipsed a relatively dark region of the stellar
photosphere. The observed patterns in the sequence of these events demonstrate
that the planet always transits over the same range of stellar latitudes, and
therefore that the stellar obliquity is less than about 10$^\circ$. We support
this conclusion with two different modeling approaches: one based on explicit
identification and timing of the events, and the other based on fitting the
light curves with a spotted-star model. We are also able to refine the usual
transit parameters and measure the stellar rotation period ($18.5 \pm
1.9$~days), corresponding to a 'gyrochronological' age of $1.4 \pm 0.3$ Gyr.
Coherent flux variations with the same period as the transits are seen
throughout the entire light curve. These variations are well modeled as the
combined effects of ellipsoidal light variations ($17.4 \pm 2.8$~ppm) and
Doppler boosting ($11.9 \pm 2.5$~ppm). The magnitudes of these effects are both
consistent with a planetary mass of $2.6 \pm 0.5~ M_{\text{Jup}}$, which is in
turn consistent with the mass determined by the Doppler technique. No
occultations are detected, giving a 2$\sigma$ upper limit of $0.013$ on the
planet's visual geometric albedo. The measured transit times are consistent
with a constant orbital period. In particular we find no evidence for orbital
decay, although we are only able to place a weak lower bound on the relevant
tidal quality factor: $Q'_\star > 1.5\times 10^4$~(95\% confidence).

augmented with topological terms, we argue that the path integral

symmetry-protected topological ground states from topologically trivial ones.
The symmetry-protection feature is demonstrated explicitly in terms of a dual
field theory, where we take into account the nontrivial spatial structure of
topological excitations, which are caused by competition among the relevant
ordering tendencies. A temporal surface contribution to the action originating
from the bulk topological term plays a central role in our study. We discuss
how the same term governs the behavior of the so-called strange correlator. In

the two point spin correlator of antiferromagnetic spin chains.

database is an important, but difficult task. State-of-the-art techniques rely
on optimised sequential scans or tree-based structures. For range queries with
small result sets, sequential scans exhibit poor asymptotic performance. Also,
as the dimensionality of the data set increases, the performance of tree-based
structures degenerates due to the curse of dimensionality. Recent literature
proposed the Elf, a main-memory structure that is optimised for the case of
such multi-dimensional low-selectivity queries. The Elf outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods in manually tuned scenarios. However, choosing an
optimal parameter configuration for the Elf is vital, since for poor
configurations, the search performance degrades rapidly. Consequently, further
knowledge about the behaviour of the Elf in different configurations is
required to achieve robust performance. In this thesis, we therefore propose a
numerical cost model for the Elf. Like all main-memory index structures, the
Elf response time is not dominated by disk accesses, refusing a straightforward
analysis. Our model predicts the size and shape of the Elf region that is
examined during search. We propose that the response time of a search is linear
to the size of this region. Furthermore, we study the impact of skewed data
distributions and correlations on the shape of the Elf. We find that they lead
to behaviour that is accurately describable through simple reductions in
attribute cardinality. Our experimental results indicate that for data sets of
up to 15 dimensions, our cost model predicts the size of the examined Elf
region with relative errors below 5%. Furthermore, we find that the size of the
Elf region examined during search predicts the response time with an accuracy
of 80%.

class of cryogenic memory devices. One style of memory device contains a spin
valve with one ""hard"" magnetic layer and one ""soft"" layer. To achieve low
switching fields, it is advantageous for the soft layer to have low
magnetization and low magnetocrystalline anisotropy. A candidate class of
materials that fulfills these criteria is the Pd$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$ alloy system
with low Fe concentrations. We present studies of micron-scale
elliptically-shaped Josephson junctions containing Pd$_{97}$Fe$_{3}$ layers of
varying thickness. By applying an external magnetic field, the critical current
of the junctions are found to follow characteristic Fraunhofer patterns. The
maximum value of the critical current, extracted from the Fraunhofer patterns,
oscillates as a function of the ferromagnetic barrier thickness, indicating
transitions in the phase difference across the junction between values of zero

  The straight-line fit provides the most robust estimator since it does not

around rotating boson stars and Kerr black holes with scalar hair can exhibit
chaotic patterns. Since no separation of variables is known (or expected) for
geodesic motion on these backgrounds, we examine the 2D effective potentials
for photon trajectories, to obtain a deeper understanding of this phenomenon.
We find that the emergence of stable light rings on the background spacetimes,
allows the formation of ""pockets"" in one of the effective potentials, for open
sets of impact parameters, leading to an effective trapping of some
trajectories, dubbed quasi-bound orbits. We conclude that pocket formation
induces chaotic scattering, although not all chaotic orbits are associated to
pockets. These and other features are illustrated in a gallery of examples,
obtained with a new ray-tracing code, PYHOLE, which includes tools for a
simple, simultaneous visualization of the effective potential together with the
spacetime trajectory, for any given point in a lensing image. An analysis of
photon orbits allows us to further establish a positive correlation between
photon orbits in chaotic regions and those with more than one turning point in
the radial direction; we recall that the latter is not possible around Kerr
black holes. Moreover, we observe that the existence of several light rings
around a horizon (several fundamental orbits, including a stable one), is a
central ingredient for the existence of multiple shadows of a single hairy
black hole. We also exhibit the lensing and shadows by Kerr black holes with
scalar hair, observed away from the equatorial plane, obtained with PYHOLE.

accurately describes the full quantum theory when the occupancy numbers of
systems are very large. However, the situation is less understood in
interacting theories, especially on time scales longer than the dynamical
relaxation time. Recently there have been claims that the quantum theory
deviates spectacularly from the classical theory on this time scale, even if
the occupancy numbers are extremely large. Furthermore, it is claimed that the
quantum theory quickly thermalizes while the classical theory does not. The
evidence for these claims comes from noticing a spectacular difference in the
time evolution of expectation values of quantum operators compared to the
classical micro-state evolution. If true, this would have dramatic consequences
for many important phenomena, including laboratory studies of interacting BECs,
dark matter axions, preheating after inflation, etc. In this work we critically
examine these claims. We show that in fact the classical theory can describe
the quantum behavior in the high occupancy regime, even when interactions are
large. The connection is that the expectation values of quantum operators in a
single quantum micro-state are approximated by a corresponding classical
ensemble average over many classical micro-states. Furthermore, by the ergodic
theorem, a classical ensemble average of local fields with statistical
translation invariance is the spatial average of a single micro-state. So the
correlation functions of the quantum and classical field theories of a single
micro-state approximately agree at high occupancy, even in interacting systems.
Furthermore, both quantum and classical field theories can thermalize, when
appropriate coarse graining is introduced, with the classical case requiring a
cutoff on low occupancy UV modes. We discuss applications of our results.

the convergence of the sum rule, and dynamical aspects of chiral symmetry
breaking---as exploited using chiral perturbation theory---which allow the
rigorous inclusion of explicit chiral symmetry breaking effects due to
light-quark masses. The original derivations obtained the sum rule in the

Greece and long-slit spectra from the MES instrument at the San Pedro Martir

from several other optical telescopes. Position-velocity arrays are produced of
the shell, and also individual knots, and are then used for morpho-kinematic
modelling with the shape code. Evidence is found for the interaction of knots
with each other and with a wind component, most likely the periodic fast wind
emanating from the central binary system. We find that a cylindrical shell with
a lower velocity polar structure gives the best model fit to the spectroscopy
and imaging. We show in this work that the previously seen jet-like feature is
of low velocity. The individual knots have irregular tail shapes; we propose
here that they emanate from episodic winds from ongoing dwarf nova outbursts by
the central system. The nova shell is cylindrical and the symmetry axis relates
to the inclination of the central binary system. Furthermore, the cylinder axis
is aligned with the long axis of the bipolar planetary nebula in which it is
embedded. Thus, the central binary system is responsible for the bipolarity of
the planetary nebula and the cylindrical nova shell. The gradual planetary
nebula ejecta versus sudden nova ejecta is the reason for the different degrees
of bipolarity. We propose that the 'jet' feature is an illuminated lobe of the
fossil planetary nebula that surrounds the nova shell.

can inform the study of brain function organization. However, fMRI connectomes
additionally involve negative edges, which are not rigorously accounted for by
existing approaches to modularity that either ignores or arbitrarily weight
these connections. Furthermore, most Q maximization-based modularity algorithms
yield variable results with suboptimal reproducibility. Here we present an
alternative, reproducible approach that exploits how frequent the BOLD-signal
correlation between two nodes is negative. We validated this novel
probability-based modularity approach on two independent publicly-available
resting-state connectome dataset (the Human Connectome Project and the 1000
Functional Connectomes) and demonstrated that negative correlations alone are
sufficient in understanding resting-state modularity. In fact, this approach a)
permits a dual formulation, leading to equivalent solutions regardless of
whether one considers positive or negative edges; b) is theoretically linked to
the Ising model defined on the connectome, thus yielding modularity result that
maximizes data likelihood. We additionally were able to detect sex differences
in modularity that the most widely utilized methods did not. Results confirmed
the superiority of our approach in that: a) correlations with the highest
probability of being negative are consistently placed between modules, b) due
to the equivalent dual forms, no arbitrary weighting factor is required to
balance the influence between negative and positive correlations, unlike
existing Q maximization-based modularity approaches. As datasets like HCP
become widely available for analysis by the neuroscience community at large,
appropriate computational tools to understand the neurobiological information
of negative edges in fMRI connectomes are increasingly important.

structures settle in. We find that the ordered moment rises slowly, even at
very low temperature, in agreement with macroscopic magnetization.
Interestingly, for $H \parallel [1\bar{1}0]$, the ordered moment appears on the
so called $\alpha$ chains only. The spin excitation spectrum is essentially
{\it inelastic} and consists in a broad flat mode centered at about 0.4 meV
with a magnetic structure factor which resembles the spin ice pattern. For $H
\parallel [1\bar{1}0]$ (at least up to 2.5 T), we find that a well defined mode
forms from this broad response, whose energy increases with $H$, in the same
way as the temperature of the specific heat anomaly. We finally discuss these
results in the light of mean field calculations and propose a new
interpretation where quadrupolar interactions play a major role, overcoming the
magnetic exchange. In this picture, the spin ice pattern appears shifted up to
finite energy because of those new interactions. We then propose a range of
acceptable parameters for \przr\, that allow to reproduce several experimental

of the Kan condition for simplicial sets. An explicit construction of Henriques
produces certain Lie $\infty$-groupoids called `Lie $\infty$-groups' by
integrating finite type Lie $n$-algebras. In order to study the compatibility
between this integration procedure and the homotopy theory of Lie $n$-algebras
introduced in the companion paper arXiv:1809.05999, we present a homotopy
theory for Lie $\infty$-groupoids. Unlike Kan simplicial sets and the higher
geometric groupoids of Behrend and Getzler, Lie $\infty$-groupoids do not form
a category of fibrant objects (CFO), since the category of manifolds lacks
pullbacks. Instead, we show that Lie $\infty$-groupoids form an `incomplete
category of fibrant objects' in which the weak equivalences correspond to
`stalkwise' weak equivalences of simplicial sheaves. This homotopical structure
enjoys many of the same properties as a CFO, such as having, in the presence of
functorial path objects, a convenient realization of its simplicial
localization. We further prove that the acyclic fibrations are precisely the
hypercovers, which implies that many of Behrend and Getzler's results also hold
in this more general context. As an application, we show that Henriques'
integration functor is an exact functor with respect to a class of
distinguished fibrations which we call `quasi-split fibrations'. Such
fibrations include acyclic fibrations as well as fibrations that arise in
string-like extensions. In particular, integration sends $L_\infty$
quasi-isomorphisms to weak equivalences, quasi-split fibrations to Kan
fibrations, and preserves acyclic fibrations, as well as pullbacks of
acyclic/quasi-split fibrations.

all compatible complex structures on an arbitrary, but fixed prequantizable
symplectic manifold, which satisfies a certain Fano type condition. The
subspace of the tangent space to the space of compatible complex structures on
which the constructed Hitchin connection is defined, is in fact of finite
co-dimension, if the symplectic manifold is compact. In a number of examples,
including flat symplectic space, symplectic tori and moduli spaces of flat

defined in a neighbourhood of the natural families of complex structures

the discontinuity in the probability of treatment when a covariate (assignment
variable) exceeds a known threshold. When the assignment variable is measured
with error, however, the discontinuity in the relationship between the
probability of treatment and the observed mismeasured assignment variable may
disappear. Therefore, the presence of measurement error in the assignment
variable poses a direct challenge to treatment effect identification. This
paper provides sufficient conditions to identify the RD treatment effect using
the mismeasured assignment variable, the treatment status and the outcome
variable. We prove identification separately for discrete and continuous
assignment variables and study the properties of various estimation procedures.
We illustrate the proposed methods in an empirical application, where we
estimate Medicaid takeup and its crowdout effect on private health insurance

in the degenerated chiral zero modes on the rectangle extra dimensions since
they do not feel the boundaries. In the case of (ii), this rotational symmetry
is promoted to the two-dimensional conformal symmetry though no chiral massless
zero mode appears. We also discuss the correspondence between our model on a
rectangle and orbifold models in some details.

  In this paper, we apply the gradient flow method to calculate the
energy-momentum tensor in (2+1)-flavor QCD. As the first application of the
method with dynamical quarks, we study at a single but fine lattice spacing
a=0.07 fm with heavy u and d quarks ($m_\pi/m_\rho=0.63$) and approximately
physical s quark. Performing simulations on lattices with Nt=16 to 4, the
temperature range of T=174-697 MeV is covered. We find that the results of the
pressure and the energy density by the gradient flow method are consistent with
the previous results using the T-integration method at T<280 MeV, while the
results show disagreement at T>350 MeV (Nt<8), presumably due to the small-Nt
lattice artifact of $O((aT)^2)=O(1/N_t^2)$.
  We also apply the gradient flow method to evaluate the chiral condensate
taking advantage of the gradient flow method that renormalized quantities can
be directly computed avoiding the difficulty of explicit chiral violation with
lattice quarks. We compute the renormalized chiral condensate in the MS-bar
scheme at renormalization scale $\mu=2$ GeV with a high precision to study the
temperature dependence of the chiral condensate and its disconnected
susceptibility. Even with the Wilson-type quark action, we obtain the chiral
condensate and its disconnected susceptibility showing a clear signal of

coronagraphic observations of CMEs delivered by the Metis instrument on board

associated with cooler plasma ($T \sim 10^6$ K), and that a significant
increase of the electron temperatures is observed from the core to the front of
the CME (where $T > 10^{6.3}$ K), which seems to be correlated, in all cases,
with the morphological structure of the CME as derived from visible-light

excitation levels, as well as the broad-band dust extinction. We find that the
absorber classifies as a Damped Lyman-alpha system (DLA) with
logN(HI)(cm^-2)=20.8+/-0.1. The DLA has super-Solar metallicity with a
depletion pattern typical of cold gas and an overall molecular fraction ~50%.
This is the highest f-value observed to date in a high-z intervening system.
Most of the molecular hydrogen arises from a clearly identified narrow (b~0.7
km/s), cold component in which CO molecules are also found, with logN(CO)~15.
We study the chemical and physical conditions in the cold gas. We find that the
line of sight probes the gas deep after the HI-to-H2 transition in a ~4-5
pc-size cloud with volumic density nH~80 cm^-3 and temperature of only 50 K.
Our model suggests that the presence of small dust grains (down to about 0.001
{\mu}m) and high cosmic ray ionisation rate (zeta_H a few times 10^-15 s^-1)
are needed to explain the observed atomic and molecular abundances. The
presence of small grains is also in agreement with the observed steep
extinction curve that also features a 2175 A bump. The properties of this cloud
are very similar to what is seen in diffuse molecular regions of the nearby
Perseus complex. The high excitation temperature of CO rotational levels
towards J0000+0048 betrays however the higher temperature of the cosmic
microwave background. Using the derived physical conditions, we correct for a
small contribution (0.3 K) of collisional excitation and obtain TCMB(z =
2.53)~9.6 K, in perfect agreement with the predicted adiabatic cooling of the

analysis to uncover dominant patterns of variability within a population.
Despite its ability to represent a data set in a low-dimensional space, the
interpretability of PCA remains limited. However, in neuroimaging, it is
essential to uncover clinically interpretable phenotypic markers that would
account for the main variability in the brain images of a population. Recently,
some alternatives to the standard PCA approach, such as Sparse PCA, have been
proposed, their aim being to limit the density of the components. Nonetheless,
sparsity alone does not entirely solve the interpretability problem, since it
may yield scattered and unstable components. We hypothesized that the
incorporation of prior information regarding the structure of the data may lead
to improved relevance and interpretability of brain patterns. We therefore
present a simple extension of the popular PCA framework that adds structured
sparsity penalties on the loading vectors in order to identify the few stable
regions in the brain images accounting for most of the variability. Such
structured sparsity can be obtained by combining l1 and total variation (TV)
penalties, where the TV regularization encodes higher order information about
the structure of the data. This paper presents the structured sparse PCA
(denoted SPCA-TV) optimization framework and its resolution. We demonstrate the
efficiency and versatility of SPCA-TV on three different data sets. The gains
of SPCA-TV over unstructured approaches are significant,since SPCA-TV reveals
the variability within a data set in the form of intelligible brain patterns
that are easy to interpret, and are more stable across different samples.

intrinsic time irreversibility and is manifested in various aspects of these
systems. The nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics of fluid systems including
turbulence with detailed balance breaking is shown to be driven by both the
non-Gaussian potential landscape gradient and the irreversible probability
flux, together with the reversible convective force and the stochastic stirring
force. We reveal an underlying connection of the energy flux essential for
turbulence energy cascade to the irreversible probability flux and the
non-Gaussian potential landscape generated by detailed balance breaking. Using
the energy flux as a center of connection, we demonstrate that the four-fifths
law in fully developed turbulence is a consequence and reflection of the
nonequilibrium trinity. We also show how the nonequilibrium trinity can affect
the scaling laws in turbulence.

$PrBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}$ barrier sandwiched in between two
$YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}$ or doped $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$ electrodes, with or without
magnetic fields parallel to the a-b planes. All junctions had a $\rm
T_c(high)\approx 85-90$ K and a $\rm T_c(low)\approx 50-55$ K electrodes,
allowing us to study pairs fluctuation supercurrents and inverse life times in
between these two temperatures. In junctions with a pseudogap electrode under
zero field, an excesss current due to pair fluctuations was observed which
persisted at temperatures above $\rm T_c(low)$, in the pseudogap regime, and up
to about $\rm T_c(high)$. No such excess current was observed in junctions
without a pseudo-gap in the electrode. The measured conductance spectra at
temperatures above $\rm T_c(low)$ were fitted using a modified fluctuations
model by Scalapino [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{24}, 1052(1970)] of a junction
with a serial resistance. We found that in the pseudo-gap regime, the
conductance vs voltage consists of a narrow peak sitting on top of a very broad
peak. This yielded two distinct pairs fluctuation lifetimes in the pseudogap
electrode which differ by an order of magnitude up to about $\rm T_c(high)$.
Under in-plane fields, these two lifetime values remain separated in two
distinct groups, which varied with increasing field moderately. We also found
that detection of Amperian pairing [Phys. Rev. X \textbf{4}, 031017 (2014)] in
our cuprate junctions is not feasible, due to Josephson vortices penetration
into the superconducting electrodes which drove the necessary field above the
depairing field.

order in which nearest-neighbor correlation functions indicate a tendency

that Cyclic Prefix-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM) used in

function in the presence of censoring and truncation. Average stellar radii in
magnitude bins are then obtained by a maximum likelihood parametric estimation
procedure. This method is capable of recovering the average stellar radius
within a few percent with as few as $\approx$ 10 measurements. Here it is
applied for the first time to the dataset available for the Pleiades. We find
an agreement better than $\approx$ 10 percent between the observed $R$ vs $M_K$
relationship and current standard stellar models for 1.2 $\ge M/M_{\odot} \ge$
0.85 with no evident bias. Evidence of a systematic deviation at $2\sigma$
level are found for stars with 0.8 $\ge M/M_{\odot} \ge$ 0.6 approaching the
slow-rotator sequence. Fast-rotators ($P$ < 2 d) agree with standard models
within 15 percent with no systematic deviations in the whole 1.2 $\ge
M/M_{\odot} \ge$ 0.5 range. The evidence found of a possible radius inflation
just below the lower mass limit of the slow-rotator sequence indicates a
possible connection with the transition from the fast to the slow-rotator
sequence.

meta-model of face and fingerprint presentation attacks that characterizes a
wider family of fake score distributions, including distributions of known and,
potentially, unknown attacks. This allows us to perform a thorough security
evaluation of multibiometric systems against presentation attacks, quantifying
how their vulnerability may vary also under attacks that are different from

the eruption of twisted magnetic structures known as flux ropes. However, the
locations and mechanisms of such particle acceleration during the flare and
eruption are still subject to much investigation. Observing the exact sites of
particle acceleration can help confirm how the flare and eruption are initiated
and how they evolve. Here we use the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly to analyse a
flare and erupting flux rope on 2014-April-18, while observations from the
Nancay Radio Astronomy Facility allows us to diagnose the sites of electron
acceleration during the eruption. Our analysis shows evidence for a pre-formed
flux rope which slowly rises and becomes destabilised at the time of a C-class
flare, plasma jet and the escape of >75 keV electrons from rope center into the
corona. As the eruption proceeds, continued acceleration of electrons with
energies of ~5 keV occurs above the flux rope for a period over 5 minutes. At
flare peak, one site of electron acceleration is located close to the flare
site while another is driven by the erupting flux rope into the corona at
speeds of up to 400 km/s. Energetic electrons then fill the erupting volume,
eventually allowing the flux rope legs to be clearly imaged from radio sources
at 150-445MHz. Following the analysis of Joshi et al. (2015), we conclude that
the sites of energetic electrons are consistent with flux rope eruption via a
tether-cutting or flux cancellation scenario inside a magnetic fan-spine
structure. In total, our radio observations allow us to better understand the
evolution of a flux rope eruption and its associated electron acceleration
sites, from eruption initiation to propagation into the corona.

localisation of observables as shown by Brunetti, Guido and Longo, Schroer and

make them challenging objects for chemical models. In the outer part of these
disks, the large densities and low temperatures provide a particular
environment where the binding of species onto the dust grains can be very
efficient and can affect the gas-phase chemical composition.
  We attempt to quantify to what extent the vertical abundance profiles and the
integrated column densities of molecules predicted by a detailed gas-grain code
are affected by the treatment of the molecular hydrogen physisorption at the
surface of the grains. We performed three different models using the Nautilus
gas-grain code. One model uses a H2 binding energy on the surface of water (440
K) and produces strong sticking of H2. Another model uses a small binding
energy of 23 K (as if there were already a monolayer of H2), and the sticking
of H$_2$ is almost negligible. Finally, the remaining model is an intermediate
solution known as the encounter desorption mechanism. We show that the
efficiency of molecular hydrogen binding (and thus its abundance at the surface
of the grains) can have a quantitative effect on the predicted column densities

data to Open Trip Planner, is one of the most well-known open source
international repository of geographic data. General Transit Feed
Specification, which provides transportation data to Open Trip Planner, has
been the standard for describing transit systems and platform for numerous
applications. Together, when used to implement an instance of Open Trip
Planner, these software has been helping in traffic decongestion all over the
world by assisting commuters to shift from using private transportation modes
to public ones. Their potential however goes beyond providing multi-modal
public transportation routes. This paper aims to first discuss the researchers'
experience in implementing a public transportation route planner for the
purpose of traffic decongestion.The researchers would examine the prospective
of using the system for disaster preparedness and recovery and concrete ways on
how to realize them.

proper time gauge, we convert the string amplitudes given by the Polyakov path
integrals on string world sheets into those of the second quantized theory. The
world sheet diagrams generated by the constructed open string field theory are
planar in contrast to those of the Witten's cubic string field theory. However,
the constructed string field theory is yet equivalent to the Witten's cubic
string field theory. Having obtained planar diagrams, we may adopt the
light-cone string field theory technique to calculate the multi-string
scattering amplitudes with an arbitrary number of external strings. We examine
in detail the three-string vertex diagram and the effective four-string vertex
diagrams generated perturbatively by the three-string vertex at tree level. In
the zero-slope limit, the string scattering amplitudes are identified precisely
as those of non-Abelian Yang-Mills gauge theory if the external states are

horizon as an infra-red cut-off is considered in the framework of Brans-Dicke
theory. We propose a logarithmic form $\phi \propto ln(\alpha+\beta a)$ of the
Brans-Dicke scalar field to alleviate the problems of interacting holographic
dark energy models in Brans-Dicke theory. We find that the equation of state
parameter $w_h$ and deceleration parameter $q$ are negative in the early time
which shows the early time inflation. During the evolution the sign of
parameter $q$ changes from negative to positive which means that the Universe
expands with decelerated rate whereas the sign of $w_h$ may change or remain
negative throughout the evolution depending on the values of parameters. It is
also observed that $w_h$ may cross the phantom divide line in the late time
evolution. The sign of $q$ changes from positive to negative during late time
of evolution which explains the late time accelerated expansion of the
Universe. Thus, we present a unified model of holographic dark energy which
explains the early time acceleration (inflation), medieval time deceleration
and late time acceleration. We also discuss the cosmic coincidence problem. We
obtain a time-varying density ratio of holographic dark energy to dark matter
which is a constant of order one ($r\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$) during early and late
time evolution. Therefore, our model successfully resolves the cosmic
coincidence problem.

can be photoexcited by purely intra-branch electrical transitions, without
invoking the bulk states or the magnetic Zeeman coupling. In particular, as
long as the electric pulse remains applied, the photoexcited densities lose
their character of right- and left-movers, whereas after the ending of the
pulse they propagate in opposite directions without dispersion, i.e.
maintaining their space profile unaltered. Notably we find that, while the
momentum distribution of the photoexcited wave packets depends on the
temperature $T$ and the chemical potential $\mu$ of the initial equilibrium
state and displays a non-linear behavior on the amplitude of the applied pulse,
in the mesoscopic regime the space profile of the wave packets is independent
of $T$ and $\mu$. Instead, it depends purely on the applied electric pulse, in
a linear manner, as a signature of the chiral anomaly characterising massless
Dirac electrons. We also discuss how the photoexcited wave packets can be
tailored with the electric pulse parameters, for both low and finite
frequencies.

show a bone localization error in the same order of magnitude as the standard

inside the bone shadow is reduced by 60%. In in-vivo experiments, this

characteristics distinguishing quantum and classical phenomena. In condensed
matter physics, in particular, scattering mechanisms, loss of quantum
information, or breakdown of topological protection are deeply rooted in the
intricate details of how and where the dissipation occurs. Despite its vital
importance the microscopic behavior of a system is usually not formulated in
terms of dissipation because the latter is not a readily measureable quantity
on the microscale. Although nanoscale thermometry is gaining much recent
interest, the existing thermal imaging methods lack the necessary sensitivity
and are unsuitable for low temperature operation required for study of quantum

network by allowing jobs of different classes to visit the same server. While
such a generalization seems rather natural, from a structural perspective there
is a significant gap between the two concepts. Nice analytical features of
Jackson networks, such as stability conditions, product-form equilibrium
distributions, and stochastic monotonicity do not immediately carry over to the
multi-class framework. The aim of this paper is to shed some light on this
structural gap, focusing on monotonicity properties. To this end, we introduce
and study a class of Markov processes, which we call \emph{Q-processes},
modeling the time evolution of the network configuration of any open,
work-conservative McQN having exponential service times and {Poisson input}. We
define a new monotonicity notion tailored for this class of processes. Our main
result is that we show monotonicity for a large class of McQN models, covering
virtually all instances of practical interest. This leads to interesting
properties which are commonly encountered for `traditional' queueing processes,
such as (i)~monotonicity with respect to external arrival rates and
(ii)~star-convexity of the stability region (with respect to the external
arrival rates); such properties are well known for Jackson networks, but had
not been established at this level of generality. This research was partly
motivated by the recent development of a simulation-based method which allows
one to numerically determine the stability region of a McQN parametrized in
terms of the arrival rates vector.

diagrams, with the aid of bimodality. The first diagram consists of stationary
states, and has the standard continuous synchronization transition and a
subsequent discontinuous transition as the coupling strength increases. Such a
bifurcation diagram has been also reported in a variant model, which breaks the
odd symmetry of the coupling function by introducing the phase lag. The second
diagram includes the oscillatory state emerging from the partially synchronized
state and followed by a discontinuous transition. This diagram is firstly
revealed in this study. The two bifurcation diagrams are obtained by employing
the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, and are verified by direct $N$-body simulations. We
conclude that the asymmetry in distribution, with the bimodality, plays a
similar role to the phase lag, and diversifies the transitions.

computations while threads that fall outside are discarded at runtime. In this
work we study the case of mapping threads efficiently onto triangular domain
problems and propose a block-space linear map $\lambda(\omega)$, based on the
properties of the lower triangular matrix, that reduces the number of
unnnecessary threads from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Performance
results for global memory accesses show an improvement of up to $18\%$ with

annihilation in the center of the Earth. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles
(WIMPs), candidates for dark matter, can scatter off nuclei inside the Earth
and fall below its escape velocity. Over time the captured WIMPs will be
accumulated and may eventually self-annihilate. Among the annihilation products
only neutrinos can escape from the center of the Earth. Large-scale neutrino
telescopes, such as the cubic kilometer IceCube Neutrino Observatory located at
the South Pole, can be used to search for such neutrino fluxes.
  Data from 327 days of detector livetime during 2011/ 2012 were analyzed. No
excess beyond the expected background from atmospheric neutrinos was detected.
The derived upper limits on the annihilation rate of WIMPs in the Earth and the
resulting muon flux are an order of magnitude stronger than the limits of the
last analysis performed with data from IceCube's predecessor AMANDA. The limits
can be translated in terms of a spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section.
For a WIMP mass of 50 GeV this analysis results in the most restrictive limits
achieved with IceCube data.

condition on states of a quantum communication network that contains ""backward
time-steps"" in some of its branches. It has been argued that this is an
analogue for quantum processes in the presence of closed timelike curves
(CTCs). The unusual properties of states of quantum communication networks that
fulfill the D-CTC condition have been discussed extensively in recent
literature. In this work, the D-CTC condition is investigated in the framework
of quantum field theory in the local, operator-algebraic approach due to Haag
and Kastler. It is shown that the D-CTC condition cannot be fulfilled in states
which are analytic for the energy, or satisfy the Reeh-Schlieder property, for
a certain class of processes and initial conditions. On the other hand, if a
quantum field theory admits sufficiently many uncorrelated states across
acausally related spacetime regions (as implied by the split property), then
the D-CTC condition can always be fulfilled approximately to arbitrary
precision. As this result pertains to quantum field theory on globally
hyperbolic spacetimes where CTCs are absent, one may conclude that interpreting
the D-CTC condition as characteristic for quantum processes in the presence of
CTCs could be misleading, and should be regarded with caution. Furthermore, a
construction of the quantized massless Klein-Gordon field on the Politzer
spacetime, often viewed as spacetime analogue for quantum communication
networks with backward time-steps, is proposed in this work.

of matrices: these molecules enable the analytes desorption and ionization
(D/I) processes but also generate strong interfering signals in the low mass
spectral region, preventing a suitable detection of low molecular weight
compounds. The possibility to avoid their use will ease both sample preparation
and mass spectrum (MS) interpretation. In recent years nanostructured surfaces
have been proposed as a viable method to achieve such goal but the results are
limited to specific classes of chemical compounds and the approach lacks in
generality. Here we demonstrate that the fluorination of surfaces is the only
step needed to activate the target and to achieve matrix-free operation with
the same detection limit obtained using nanostructured chips. The results of
this work suggest that D/I is a purely interfacial effect, with negligible
contribution from chemical nature of the underlying substrate, provided that
the substrate is conductive and able to efficiently absorb the UV laser beam.

Weyl semimetals, the magnon bands in a magnonic Weyl semimetal are nontrivially

them well-posed for all parameters, at the condition that sufficient
dissipation is associated with volume changes. In addition to the usual Coulomb
shear friction coefficient $\mu$, we introduce a bulk friction coefficient
$\mu_b$, associated to volume changes and show that the equations are
well-posed in two dimensions if $\mu_b>2-2\mu$ ($\mu_b>3-7\mu/2$ in three
dimensions). Moreover, we show that the ill-posed domain defined in
\citep{Barker2015} transforms into a domain where the equations are unstable
but stay well-posed when compressibility is taken into account. These results
suggest thus the importance of compressibility in dense granular flows.

interstellar medium in each galaxy and each kinematic component by using
molecular line ratio diagnostics in three complementary ways. First, we measure
the ratios of the position-velocity diagrams of different lines, second we
measure the ratios of each kinematic component's integrated line intensities as
a function of projected position, and third we model these line ratios using a
non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer code. Overall, the
nuclear discs appear to have a tenuous molecular gas component that is hotter,
optically thinner and with a larger dense gas fraction than that in the inner
rings, suggesting more dense clumps immersed in a hotter more diffuse molecular
medium. This is consistent with evidence that the physical conditions in the
nuclear discs are similar to those in photo-dissociation regions. A similar
picture emerges when comparing the observed molecular line ratios with those of
other galaxy types. The physical conditions of the molecular gas in the nuclear
discs of NGC4710 and NGC5866 thus appear intermediate between those of spiral
galaxies and starbursts, while the star formation in their inner rings is even

users sequentially interacting with a recommender system. Users are modeled as
latent mixtures of C many representative user classes, where each class
specifies a mean reward profile across actions. Both the user features (mixture
distribution over classes) and the item features (mean reward vector per class)
are unknown a priori. The user identity is the only contextual information
available to the learner while interacting. This induces a low-rank structure
on the matrix of expected rewards r a,b from recommending item a to user b. The
problem reduces to the well-known linear bandit when either user or item-side
features are perfectly known. In the setting where each user, with its
stochastically sampled taste profile, interacts only for a small number of
sessions, we develop a bandit algorithm for the two-sided uncertainty. It
combines the Robust Tensor Power Method of Anandkumar et al. (2014b) with the
OFUL linear bandit algorithm of Abbasi-Yadkori et al. (2011). We provide the
first rigorous regret analysis of this combination, showing that its regret
after T user interactions is $\tilde O(C\sqrt{BT})$, with B the number of
users. An ingredient towards this result is a novel robustness property of
OFUL, of independent interest.

signal in hydrogen-deuterium mixtures, compared to pure elements that have the

which are the main source of information about the structure of high-pressure

are localized almost to single molecules, and are not zone-center phonons. In
mixtures, each observable IR peak corresponds to a collection of many such
molecular vibrations, which have a distribution of frequencies depending on
local environment. Furthermore discrete groups of environments cause the peaks
to split. We illustrate this issue by considering the IR spectrum of the high
pressure Phase III structure of hydrogen, recently interpreted as showing novel
phases in isotopic mixtures. We calculate the IR spectrum of hydrogen/deuterium
mixtures in the $C2/c$ and $Cmca$-12 structures, showing that isotopic disorder
gives rise to mode localization of the high frequency vibrons. The local
coordination of the molecules leads to discrete IR peaks. The spread of
frequencies is strongly enhanced with pressure, such that more peaks become
resolvable at higher pressures, in agreement with the recent measurements.

superconducting critical temperature (T_c = 15.0 K - 15.3 K) over a 100 mm
diameter wafer. However, the shuttling appears to increase the resistivity by
almost a factor of 2 compared to static deposition. Surface SEM inspections
suggest that the shuttling could have induced a different mode of
microstructural film growth.

simultaneously sample the joint posterior distribution of age, distance, and

populations. We find the helium differences among the two populations in the
clusters fall in the range of ~0.04 to 0.11. Because adequate models varying in
CNO are not presently available, we view these spreads as upper limits and
present them with statistical rather than observational uncertainties. Evidence
supports previous studies suggesting an increase in helium content concurrent
with increasing mass of the cluster and also find that the proportion of the
first population of stars increases with mass as well. Our results are examined

as a special averaging technique (SAT), which consists of wavelet
transformation in its first stage, a globally statistical adaptive detecting
algorithm as a second stage; and in the third stage it replaces the affected
peaks by making use of moving average filter process. In the NN work, the
learning process makes use of a previously published work that is based on
three linear coding techniques. In order to check the proposed work validity, a
MATLAB simulation has been run and has two main variables to compare with;
namely BER and CCDF curves. This is true under the same bandwidth occupancy and
channel characteristics. Two types of tested data have been used; randomly
generated data and a practical data that have been extracted from a funded
project entitled by ECEM. From the achieved simulation results, the work that
is based on SAT shows promising results in reducing the PAPR effect reached up
to 80% over the work in the literature and our previously published work. This
means that this work gives an extra reduction up to 15% of our previously
published work. However, this achievement will be under the cost of complexity.
This penalty could be optimized by imposing the NN to the SAT work in order to
enhance the wireless systems performance.

source of matter accreted by the compact object. With this first paper, we
introduce a ballistic model to characterize the structure of the wind at the
orbital scale as it accelerates, from the stellar surface to the vicinity of
the accretor. Thanks to the parametrization we retained and the numerical
pipeline we designed, we can investigate the supersonic flow and the subsequent
observables as a function of a reduced set of characteristic numbers and
scales. We show that the shape of the permanent flow is entirely determined by
the mass ratio, the filling factor, the Eddington factor and the $\alpha$-force
multiplier which drives the stellar wind acceleration. Provided scales such as
the orbital period are known, we can trace back the observables to evaluate the
mass accretion rates, the accretion mechanism, the shearing of the inflow and
the stellar parameters. We confront our model to three persistent Supergiant

many-body localized system in one dimension. Our construction, conceptually
based on the ansatz introduced in Phys. Rev. B 94, 041116(R) (2016), is built
from two layers of unitary matrices which act on blocks of $\ell$ contiguous
sites.
  We argue this yields an exponential reduction in computational time and
memory requirement as compared to all previous approaches for finding a
representation of the complete eigenspectrum of large many-body localized
systems with a given accuracy. Concretely, we optimize the unitaries by
minimizing the magnitude of the commutator of the approximate integrals of
motion and the Hamiltonian, which can be done in a local fashion. This further
reduces the computational complexity of the tensor networks arising in the
minimization process compared to previous work. We test the accuracy of our
method by comparing the approximate energy spectrum to exact diagonalization
results for the random field Heisenberg model on 16 sites. We find that the
technique is highly accurate deep in the localized regime and maintains a
surprising degree of accuracy in predicting certain local quantities even in
the vicinity of the predicted dynamical phase transition. To demonstrate the
power of our technique, we study a system of 72 sites and we are able to see
clear signatures of the phase transition. Our work opens a new avenue to study
properties of the many-body localization transition in large systems.

way functions (OWF). Starting from a provably intractable decision problem
$L_D$ (whose existence is nonconstructively assured from the well-known
discrete time-hierarchy theorem from complexity theory), we construct another
intractable decision problem $L\subseteq \{0,1\}^*$ that has its words
scattered across $\{0,1\}^\ell$ at a relative frequency $p(\ell)$, for which
upper and lower bounds can be worked out. The value $p(\ell)$ is computed from
the density of the language within $\{0,1\}^\ell$ divided by the total word
count $2^\ell$. It corresponds to the probability of retrieving a yes-instance
of a decision problem upon a uniformly random draw from $\{0,1\}^\ell$. The
trick to find a language with known bounds on $p(\ell)$ relies on switching
from $L_D$ to $L_0:=L_D\cap L'$, where $L'$ is an easy-to-decide language with
a known density across $\{0,1\}^*$. In defining $L'$ properly (and upon a
suitable G\""odel numbering), the hardness of deciding $L_D\cap L'$ is inherited
from $L_D$, while its density is controlled by that of $L'$. The lower and
upper approximation of $p(\ell)$ then let us construct an explicit threshold
function (as in random graph theory) that can be used to efficiently and
intentionally sample yes- or no-instances of the decision problem (language)
$L_0$ (however, without any auxiliary information that could ease the decision
like a polynomial witness). In turn, this allows to construct a weak OWF that
encodes a bit string $w\in\{0,1\}^*$ by efficiently (in polynomial time)
emitting a sequence of randomly constructed intractable decision problems,
whose answers correspond to the preimage $w$.

  Problem",,,,,"math.CO cs.DM math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the rendezvous problem, two parties with different labelings of the
vertices of a complete graph are trying to meet at some vertex at the same
time. It is well-known that if the parties have predetermined roles, then the
strategy where one of them waits at one vertex, while the other visits all $n$
vertices in random order is optimal, taking at most $n$ steps and averaging
about $n/2$. Anderson and Weber considered the symmetric rendezvous problem,
where both parties must use the same randomized strategy. They analyzed
strategies where the parties repeatedly play the optimal asymmetric strategy,
determining their role independently each time by a biased coin-flip. By tuning
the bias, Anderson and Weber achieved an expected meeting time of about $0.829
n$, which they conjectured to be asymptotically optimal.
  We change perspective slightly: instead of minimizing the expected meeting
time, we seek to maximize the probability of meeting within a specified time
$T$. The Anderson-Weber strategy, which fails with constant probability when
$T= \Theta(n)$, is not asymptotically optimal for large $T$ in this setting.
Specifically, we exhibit a symmetric strategy that succeeds with probability
$1-o(1)$ in $T=4n$ steps. This is tight: for any $\alpha < 4$, any symmetric
strategy with $T = \alpha n$ fails with constant probability. Our strategy uses
a new combinatorial object that we dub a ""rendezvous code,"" which may be of
independent interest.
  When $T \le n$, we show that the probability of meeting within $T$ steps is
indeed asymptotically maximized by the Anderson-Weber strategy. Our results
imply new lower bounds, showing that the best symmetric strategy takes at least
$0.638 n$ steps in expectation. We also present some partial results for the
symmetric rendezvous problem on other vertex-transitive graphs.

being measured until it comes to equilibrium, at which point the readout is
related to the final energy state of the thermometer. A recent paper noted that
different-temperature baths lead not only to different equilibrium states but
also to different equilibration rates. In some cases this means that
temperature discrimination is better achieved by comparing the rates than the
asymptotic states -- and should therefore be carried out at finite times rather
than once equilibration is essentially complete. The theory work also noted
that for a \emph{quantum} thermometer, the difference between the relaxation
rates for populations and coherences means that for intermediate time regimes
(before full equilibration but after some characteristic time that depends on
the temperatures of the baths), optimal discrimination is achieved not by
probing energy only but by using quantum coherence as well. In this work, we
study these effects experimentally. Implementing a recent proposal for
efficiently emulating an arbitrary quantum channel, we use the quantum
polarisation state of individual photons as models of ""single-qubit
thermometers"" which evolve for a certain time in contact with a thermal bath.
We investigate the optimal thermometer states for temperature discrimination,
and the optimal interaction times, confirming that there is a broad regime
where quantum coherence provides a significant improvement. We also discuss the
more practical question of thermometers composed of a finite number of
spins/qubits (greater than one), and characterize the performance of an
adaptive protocol for making optimal use of all the qubits.

and 195 research articles corresponding to 6 different diseases available from
UpToDate, a publicly available clinical knowledge system, and from the National
Guideline Clearinghouse, a public resource for evidence-based clinical practice
guidelines. Results: We show that CRTS not only covers the recommendations but
also is flexible to be extended to represent information from primary
literature. We also describe how our developed type system can be applied for
clinical decision support, medical knowledge summarization, and citation
retrieval. Conclusion: We showed that our proposed type system is precise and
comprehensive in representing a large sample of recommendations available for
various disorders. CRTS can now be used to build interoperable information
extraction systems that automatically extract clinical recommendations and

back-propagation algorithm, where the gradient for learning is provided by
back-propagating the error, layer by layer, from the output layer to the hidden
layers. A recently discovered method called feedback-alignment shows that the
weights used for propagating the error backward don't have to be symmetric with
the weights used for propagation the activation forward. In fact, random
feedback weights work evenly well, because the network learns how to make the
feedback useful. In this work, the feedback alignment principle is used for
training hidden layers more independently from the rest of the network, and
from a zero initial condition. The error is propagated through fixed random
feedback connections directly from the output layer to each hidden layer. This
simple method is able to achieve zero training error even in convolutional
networks and very deep networks, completely without error back-propagation. The
method is a step towards biologically plausible machine learning because the
error signal is almost local, and no symmetric or reciprocal weights are
required. Experiments show that the test performance on MNIST and CIFAR is

UpToDate for two diseases, heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AFib).
The system achieved an overall F-score of 41.2% on HF topics and 42.4% on AFib

significantly high when compared to a query-expansion based baseline (F-score
of 1.3% on HF and 2.2% on AFib) and a system that uses query expansion with

the system with top K relevant citations, where K is the number of citations in

considered a system consisting of a single particle moving in a plane. A
magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plane. The system is in contact
with a thermal bath. We have considered three cases: (a) particle moving in a
homogeneous medium, (b) particle moving in a medium with space dependent
friction and (c) particle moving in a medium with space dependent temperature.
For all the three cases average magnetic moment and fluctuations in magnetic
moment has been calculated. Average magnetic moment saturates to a finite value
in case of free particle but goes to zero when the particle is confined by a
2-D harmonic potential. Fluctuations in magnetic moment shows universal
features in the presence of arbitrary friction inhomogeneity. For this case the
system reaches equilibrium asymptotically. In case of space dependent
temperature profile, the stationary distribution is non-Gibbsian and

the conditions that the ellipse of curvature at any point is centered at this

locally admits geometrically determined parameters - canonical parameters. In
such parameters the Gauss curvature and the normal curvature satisfy a system
of two natural partial differential equations and determine the surface up to a
motion. For any minimal surface parameterized by canonical parameters we obtain
Weierstrass representations - canonical Weierstrass representations. These

minimal surfaces of general type, the solutions to the system of natural

tunable nonlinearities and the well developed techniques for trapping,

generation of entangled states of trapped ions, cold and ultracold gases of
neutral atoms. Moreover, atoms can couple strongly to external forces and light

number of linear orderings of $V(G)$ such that every two nonincident edges are

dimension $\pi_f(G)$, which is the minimum of $a/b$ such that some $a$ linear
orderings (repetition allowed) separate every two nonincident edges at least
$b$ times.
  In contrast to separation dimension, fractional separation dimension is
bounded: always $\pi_f(G)\le 3$, with equality if and only if $G$ contains
$K_4$. There is no stronger bound even for bipartite graphs, since
$\pi_f(K_{m,m})=\pi_f(K_{m+1,m})=\frac{3m}{m+1}$. We also compute $\pi_f(G)$

$4/3$.
  Finally, we consider analogous problems for circular orderings, where pairs

the PRMAC protocol, for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) enable a node to
schedule multi-hop transmission of multiple data packets in a cycle. However,
these systems accommodate both the request-to-send data process and the
confirmation-to-send data process in the same data transmission scheduling
window (i.e. data window). This reduces the length of the multi-hop flow setup
in the data window. In a multi-hop scenario, this degrades both the packet
delivery ratio (PDR) and the end-to-end transmission delay (E2ETD). In this
paper, we propose a cross-layer contention based synchronous MAC protocol,
which accommodates the request-to-send data process in the data window and the
confirmation-to-send data process in the sleep window for increased efficiency.
We evaluate our proposed protocol through ns-2.35 simulations and compare its
performance with the PRMAC protocol. Results suggest that in multi-hop

the packet delivery ratio (PDR).

lines, and these galactic building blocks can manifest as Damped Lyman-Alpha
Absorbers (DLAs) and Lyman Limit Systems (LLSs). We use radio observations of
Faraday effects to test whether DLAs and LLSs host a magnetised medium, by
combining DLA and LLS detections throughout the literature with 1.4 GHz
polarization data from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). We obtain a control, a
DLA, and a LLS sample consisting of 114, 19, and 27 lines-of-sight respectively
- all of which are polarized at $\ge8\sigma$ to ensure Rician bias is
negligible. Using a Bayesian framework, we are unable to detect either coherent
or random magnetic fields in DLAs: the regular coherent magnetic fields within
the DLAs must be $\le2.8$ $\mu$G, and the lack of depolarization is consistent
with the weakly magnetised gas in DLAs being non-turbulent and quiescent.
However, we find mild suggestive evidence that LLSs have coherent magnetic
fields: after controlling for the redshift-distribution of our data, we find a
71.5% probability that LLSs have a higher RM than a control sample. We also
find strong evidence that LLSs host random magnetic fields, with a 95.5%
probability that LLS lines-of-sight have lower polarized fractions than a
control sample. The regular coherent magnetic fields within the LLSs must be
$\le2.4$ $\mu$G, and the magnetised gas must be highly turbulent with a typical
scale on the order of $\approx5$-20 pc, which is similar to that of the Milky
Way. This is consistent with the standard dynamo pedagogy, whereby magnetic
fields in protogalaxies increase in coherence and strength as a function of
cosmic time. Our results are consistent with a hierarchical galaxy formation
scenario, with the DLAs, LLSs, and strong magnesium II (MgII) systems exploring
three different stages of magnetic field evolution in galaxies.

structures describing many inter-metallic alloys. They are usually described in
term of their atomic environments, with atoms having $12, 14, 15$ and $16$
neighbours, coded into the canonical $Z_p$ cells (with $p$ the coordination
number), the case $p=12$ corresponding to a local icosahedral environment. In
addition, the long range structure is captured by the geometry of a network
(called either ""major skeleton"" or ""disclination network"") connecting only the
non-icosahedral sites (with $p\ne 12$). Another interesting description, valid
for the so-called ""layered F-K phases"", amounts to give simple rules to
decorate specific periodic 2d tilings made of triangles and squares and
eventually get the 3d periodic F-K phases. Quasicrystalline phases can sometime
be found in the vicinity, in the phase diagram, of the F-K crystalline alloys;
it is therefore of interest to understand if and how the standard F-K
construction rules can be generalized on top of an underlying quasiperiodic
structure. It is in particular natural to investigate how well square-triangle
quasiperiodic tilings with dodecagonal symmetry, made of square and
(equilateral) triangles, can be used as building frames to generate some
F-K-like quasicrystalline structures. We show here how to produce two types of
such structures, which are quasiperiodic in a plane and periodic in the third
direction, and containing (or not) $Z_{16}$ sites.

predicting coaxial stacking and RNAJAG for modelling junction topologies as
tree graphs to incorporate constrained tree matching and dynamic programming
algorithms into a new method, called CHSalign, for aligning the secondary

to be an efficient alignment tool for RNAs containing similar junctions.
Experimental results based on thousands of alignments demonstrate that CHSalign
can align two RNA secondary structures containing CHS motifs more accurately
than other RNA secondary structure alignment tools. CHSalign yields a high
score when aligning two RNA secondary structures with similar CHS motifs or
helical arrangement patterns, and a low score otherwise. This new method has

of the equations for the fundamental laws of physics. The success of this
approach in the context of general relativity and particle physics motivates
the conjecture that symmetries may help us to one day uncover the ultimate
theory that provides a unique, unified description of all observed physical
phenomena. We examine some of the strengths and weaknesses of this conjecture.

into account in relativistic physics: a geometric time, which emanates from the
structure of spacetime and its metrics, and a causal time, indicating the flow
from the past to the future. A particularity of causal times is that its values
have no intrinsic meaning, as their evolution alone is meaningful. In the
context of relativistic Lagrangian mechanics, causal times corresponds to
admissible parameterizations of paths, and we show that in order for a
langragian to not depend on any particular causal time (as its values have no
intrinsic meaning), it has to be homogeneous in its velocity argument. We
illustrate this property with the example of a free particle in a potential.
Then, using a geometric Lagrangian (i.e. a parameterization independent
Lagrangian which is also manifestly covariant), we introduce the notion of
ageodesicity of a path which measures to what extent a path is far from being a
geodesic, and show how the notion can be used in the twin paradox to
differentiate the paths followed by the two twins.

algebra are considered from the perspective of infinite-dimensional Lie theory.
A character is controlled in our sense if it satisfies certain growth bounds,
e.g.\ exponential growth. We study these characters for combinatorial Hopf
algebras. Following Loday and Ronco, a combinatorial Hopf algebra is a graded
and connected Hopf algebra which is a polynomial algebra with an explicit
choice of basis (usually identified with combinatorial objects such as trees,
graphs, etc.). If the growth bounds and the Hopf algebra are compatible we
prove that the controlled characters form infinite-dimensional Lie groups.
Further, we identify the Lie algebra and establish regularity results (in the
sense of Milnor) for these Lie groups. The general construction principle
exhibited here enables to treat a broad class of examples from physics,
numerical analysis and control theory. Groups of controlled characters appear
in renormalisation of quantum field theories, numerical analysis and control
theory in the guise of groups of locally convergent power series. The results
presented here, generalise the construction of the (tame) Butcher group, aka
the controlled character group of the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra.

equation of state $p=\omega\rho$ with the state parameter $-1<\omega<-1/3$. The
cosmological dark energy influence on black hole spacetime are interesting and
important. In this paper, we study the Kerr-Newman-AdS solutions of the
Einstein-Maxwell equation in quintessence field around a black hole by
Newman-Janis algorithm and complex computations. From the horizon structure
equation, we obtain the expression between quintessence parameter $\alpha$ and
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ if the black hole exists two cosmological
horizon $r_{q}$ and $r_{c}$ when $\omega=-2/3$, the result is different from
rotational black hole in quintessence matter situation. Through analysis we
find that the black hole charge cannot change the value of $\alpha$. But the
black hole spin and cosmological constant are opposite. The black hole spin and
cosmological constant make the maximum value of $\alpha$ to become small. The
existence of four horizon leads seven types of extremal black holes to
constraint the parameter $\alpha$. With the state parameter $\omega$ ranging
from $-1$ to $-1/3$, the maximum value of $\alpha$ changes from $\Lambda$ to
$1$. When $\omega\rightarrow -1$, the quintessential dark energy likes
cosmological constant. The singularity of the black holes is the same with that
of Kerr black hole. We also discuss the rotation velocity of the black holes on
the equatorial plane for $\omega=-2/3,-1/2$ and $-1/3$. For small value of
$\alpha$, the rotation velocity on the equatorial plane is asymptotically flat
and it can explain the rotation curves in spiral galaxies.

  Processes",,,,"ZIB-Report 16-39","cs.DS math.DS math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present a new, optimization-based method to exhibit cyclic
behavior in non-reversible stochastic processes. While our method is general,
it is strongly motivated by discrete simulations of ordinary differential
equations representing non-reversible biological processes, in particular
molecular simulations. Here, the discrete time steps of the simulation are
often very small compared to the time scale of interest, i.e., of the whole
process. In this setting, the detection of a global cyclic behavior of the
process becomes difficult because transitions between individual states may
appear almost reversible on the small time scale of the simulation. We address
this difficulty using a mixed-integer programming model that allows us to
compute a cycle of clusters with maximum net flow, i.e., large forward and
small backward probability. For a synthetic genetic regulatory network
consisting of a ring-oscillator with three genes, we show that this approach
can detect the most productive overall cycle, outperforming classical spectral
analysis methods. Our method applies to general non-equilibrium steady state
systems such as catalytic reactions, for which the objective value computes the
effectiveness of the catalyst.

in large diode arrays based on quantum well gain media with nearest-neighbor
interactions. The crucial parameters are the evanescent coupling strength and
the relative optical frequency detuning between the emitters of the array. By
employing a recently proposed figure of merit for classifying chimera states,

variances of error terms in a time series dataset. The presence of
heteroskedasticity in data imposes serious challenges for forecasting models
and many statistical tests are not valid in the presence of heteroskedasticity.
Heteroskedasticity of the data affects the relation between the predictor
variable and the outcome, which leads to false positive and false negative
decisions in the hypothesis testing. Available approaches to study
heteroskedasticity thus far adopt the strategy of accommodating
heteroskedasticity in the time series and consider it an inevitable source of
noise. In these existing approaches, two forecasting models are prepared for
normal and heteroskedastic scenarios and a statistical test is to determine
whether or not the data is heteroskedastic.
  This work-in-progress research introduces a quantifying measurement for
heteroskedasticity. The idea behind the proposed metric is the fact that a
heteroskedastic time series features a uniformly distributed local variances.
The proposed measurement is obtained by calculating the local variances using
linear time invariant filters. A probability density function of the calculated
local variances is then derived and compared to a uniform distribution of
theoretical ultimate heteroskedasticity using statistical divergence
measurements. The results demonstrated on synthetic datasets shows a strong
correlation between the proposed metric and number of variances locally
estimated in a heteroskedastic time series.

to control their movement in pedestrian traffic flow. The tools to collect the
microscopic data and to analyze microscopic pedestrian flow are still very much
in its infancy. The microscopic pedestrian flow characteristics need to be
understood. Manual, semi manual and automatic image processing data collection
systems were developed. It was found that the microscopic speed resemble a
normal distribution with a mean of 1.38 m/second and standard deviation of 0.37
m/second. The acceleration distribution also bear a resemblance to the normal
distribution with an average of 0.68 m/ square second. A physical based
microscopic pedestrian simulation model was also developed. Both Microscopic
Video Data Collection and Microscopic Pedestrian Simulation Model generate a
database called NTXY database. The formulations of the flow performance or
microscopic pedestrian characteristics are explained. Sensitivity of the
simulation and relationship between the flow performances are described.
Validation of the simulation using real world data is then explained through
the comparison between average instantaneous speed distributions of the real
world data with the result of the simulations. The simulation model is then
applied for some experiments on a hypothetical situation to gain more
understanding of pedestrian behavior in one way and two way situations, to know
the behavior of the system if the number of elderly pedestrian increases and to
evaluate a policy of lane-like segregation toward pedestrian crossing and
inspects the performance of the crossing. It was revealed that the microscopic
pedestrian studies have been successfully applied to give more understanding to
the behavior of microscopic pedestrians flow, predict the theoretical and
practical situation and evaluate some design policies before its
implementation.
