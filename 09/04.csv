specifically chosen to be very close to the maximum value of frequency

happens when a counter phase pulse of same frequency with a small amplitude is
introduced to the second chain. If both signals exceed a threshold amplitude
for the band-gap transmission a large amplitude soliton enters the system -
therefore we have an amplifier. Although the concept may be applied in a
variety of contexts - all optical or all-magnonic systems, we choose the system

where such mechanism could be used, which might significantly broaden the

convergence in total variation distance. Our second approach depends on local
bracketing entropy methods, and allows us to prove a sharp oracle inequality,
which implies in particular that the rate of convergence with respect to
various global loss functions, including Kullback--Leibler divergence, is
$O\bigl(\frac{k}{n}\log^{5/4} n\bigr)$ when the true density is log-concave and
its logarithm is close to $k$-affine.

polarities of voltages, applied to source and drain electrodes of the

free path {\lambda} and ferroelectric substrate permittivity. We have
demonstrated, that the small values of G+/G-(0.1 and smaller), which correspond
to efficient graphene pnJ based rectifier, can be obtained for the
ferroelectrics with high and for the ratios of L/{\lambda}~1 or smaller.
However, for ferroelectrics with extremely high permittivity(relaxor or
PbZrxTi1-xO3 with composition x near the morphotropic phase boundary x=0.52)
the ratio G+/G- can be essentially smaller then unity for the case of a
pronounced diffusive regime of current as well. This makes the ferroelectric
substrates with high permittivity excellent candidates for the fabrication of
new generation of rectifiers based on the graphene pnJ. Temperature effect on
ratio was studied within Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach. We have
demonstrated that rectifying properties of the graphene pnJ become better in
the vicinity of Curie temperature. However, for the temperatures higher than
Curie temperature the rectifying effect vanishes due to the ferroelectric
polarization disappearance.

altered between different scattering channels, which can explain coexistence of
several quasiparticle interference patterns in nanoscale regions of interest.

a scale-bridging model is constructed to capture characteristics appropriate
for the application-scale from a detailed coal devolatilization model. Such
scale-bridging allows full descriptions of scale-applicable physics, while
functioning at reasonable computational costs. This study presents a variation
on multi-fidelity modeling with a detailed physics model, the chemical
percolation devolatilization model, being used to calibrate a scale-briding
model for the application of interest. The application space provides essential
context for designing the scale-bridging model by defining scales, determining
requirements and weighting desired characteristics. A single kinetic reaction
equation with functional yield model and distributed activation energy is
implemented to act as the scale-bridging model-form. Consistency constraints
are used to locate regions of the scale-bridging model's parameter-space that
are consistent with the uncertainty identified within the detailed model.
Ultimately, the performance of the scale-bridging model with consistent
parameter-sets was assessed against desired characteristics of the detailed
model and found to perform satisfactorily in capturing thermodynamic trends and
kinetic timescales for the desired application-scale. Framing the process of

null hypothesis where $\Sigma = I_p$ against an alternative hypothesis where

  We consider a Rare/Weak setting where the spikes are sparse (i.e., $1 \ll r
\ll p$) and individually weak (i.e., each spiked eigenvalue is only slightly
larger than $1$), and discover a phase transition: the two-dimensional phase
space that calibrates the spike sparsity and strengths partitions into the
Region of Impossibility and the Region of Possibility. In Region of
Impossibility, all tests are (asymptotically) powerless in separating the
alternative from the null. In Region of Possibility, there are tests that have
(asymptotically) full power.
  We consider a CuSum test, a trace-based test, an eigenvalue-based Higher
Criticism test, and a Tracy-Widom test (Johnstone 2001), and show that the
first two tests have asymptotically full power in Region of Possibility.
  To use our results from a different angle, we derive new bounds for (a)
empirical eigenvalues, and (b) cumulative sums of the empirical eigenvalues,
both under the alternative hypothesis. Part (a) is related to those in Baik,
Ben-Arous and Peche (2005), but both the settings and results are different.

estimation in multi-systems. Suppose there are $\mathtt{M}$ independent
systems, each of which has a remote sensor monitoring the system and sending
its local estimates to a fusion center over a packet-dropping channel. An
attacker may generate noises to exacerbate the communication channels between
sensors and the fusion center. Due to capacity limitation, at each time the
attacker can exacerbate at most $\mathtt{N}$ of the $\mathtt{M}$ channels. The
goal of the attacker side is to seek an optimal policy maximizing the
estimation error at the fusion center. The problem is formulated as a Markov
decision process (MDP) problem, and the existence of an optimal deterministic
and stationary policy is proved. We further show that the optimal policy has a
threshold structure, by which the computational complexity is reduced
significantly. Based on the threshold structure, a myopic policy is proposed
for homogeneous models and its optimality is established. To overcome the curse
of dimensionality of MDP algorithms for general heterogeneous models, we
further provide an asymptotically (as $\mathtt{M}$ and $\mathtt{N}$ go to

Unlike prior art which mainly deal with single-relay systems with saturated
traffic flow, we address the case of bursty data arrival at the source
cooperatively forwarded by multiple half-duplex EH relays. We aim at optimizing
the long-run average delay of the source packets under the energy neutrality
constraint on power consumption of each relay. While EH relay systems have been
predominantly optimized using either offline or online methodologies, we take
on a more realistic learning-theoretic approach. Hence, our scheme can be
deployed for real-time operation without assuming acausal information on
channel realizations, data/energy arrivals as required by offline optimization,
nor does it rely on precise statistics of the system processes as is the case
with online optimization. We formulate the problem as a partially observable
identical payoff stochastic game (PO-IPSG) with factored controllers, in which
the power control policy of each relay is adaptive to its local
source-to-relay/relay-to-destination channel states, its local energy state as
well as to the source buffer state information. We derive a multi-agent
reinforcement learning algorithm which is convergent to a locally optimal
solution of the formulated PO-IPSG. The proposed algorithm operates without
explicit message exchange between the relays, while inducing only little
source-relay signaling overhead. By simulation, we contrast the delay
performance of the proposed method against existing heuristics for throughput
maximization. It is shown that compared with these heuristics, the systematic
approach adopted in this paper has a smaller sub-optimality gap once evaluated

  We present an algorithm for robustly computing sparse Fourier transforms in

solutions of Einstein's gravity minimally coupled to a massive, complex scalar

family of rotating boson stars depending on one extra parameter, the
dimensionless scalar hair parameter $q$, ranging from 0 (Kerr black holes) to 1
(boson stars). Here we study the limiting case $q=1$, corresponding to rotating
boson stars. For comparison, spherical boson stars are also considered. We
simulate observations with XIS/Suzaku. Using the fact that current observations
are well fit by the Kerr solution and thus requiring that acceptable
alternative compact objects must be compatible with a Kerr fit, we find that
some boson star solutions are relatively easy to rule out as potential
candidates to explain astrophysical black holes, while other solutions, which
are neither too dilute nor too compact are more elusive and we argue that they

regimes in a fully convective star of mass 0.3$M_{\odot}$ rotating with period
of 10 days. For the intermediate value of the parameter of the turbulent
magnetic Prandl number, $Pm_{T}=3$ we found the oscillating dynamo regimes with
period about 40Yr. The higher $Pm_{T}$ results to longer dynamo periods. If the
large-scale flows is fixed we find that the dynamo transits from axisymmetric
to non-axisymmetric regimes for the overcritical parameter of the
$\alpha$effect. The change of dynamo regime occurs because of the
non-axisymmetric non-linear $\alpha$-effect. The situation persists in the
fully non-linear dynamo models with regards of the magnetic feedback on the
angular momentum balance and the heat transport in the star. It is found that
the large-scale magnetic field quenches the latitudinal shear in the bulk of
the star. However, the strong radial shear operates in the subsurface layer of
the star. In the nonlinear case the profile of the angular velocity inside the
star become close to the spherical surfaces. This supports the equator-ward
migration of the axisymmetric magnetic field dynamo waves. It was found that,
the magnetic configuration of the star dominates by the regular
non-axisymmetric mode m=1, forming Yin Yang magnetic polarity pattern with the
strong (>500 G) poloidal magnetic field in polar regions.

application to suspended graphene membrane and with a particular focus on the

properties of the membrane. The effect of quantum fluctuations is governed by
the dimensionless coupling constant, $g_0 \ll 1$, which vanishes in the
classical limit ($\hbar \to 0$) and is equal to $\simeq 0.05$ for graphene. We
demonstrate that the thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha_T$ of the membrane
is negative and remains nearly constant down to extremely low temperatures,
$T_0\propto \exp (-2/g_0)$. We also find that $\alpha_T$ diverges in the
classical limit: $\alpha_T \propto - \ln(1/g_0)$ for $g_0 \to 0$. For graphene
parameters, we estimate the value of the thermal expansion coefficient as
$\alpha_T \simeq - 0.23\:{\rm eV}^{-1}$, which applies below the temperature
$T_{\rm uv} \sim g_0 \varkappa_0 \sim 500$\:K (where $\varkappa_0 \sim 1$\:eV
is the bending rigidity) down to $T_0 \sim 10^{-14}$\:K. For $T<T_0$, the
thermal expansion coefficient slowly (logarithmically) approaches zero with
decreasing temperature. This behavior is surprising since typically the thermal
expansion coefficient goes to zero as a power-law function. We discuss possible
experimental consequences of this anomaly. We also evaluate classical and
quantum contributions to the specific heat of the membrane and investigate the

observed in the inelastic scattering data and a large linear term
$\gamma=6.3(8)$ mJmol$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ in the specific heat is attributed to the
presence of short range exchange interactions, which is understood to be
contributing to the observed ferroelectricity. Further the nuclear and magnetic
entropies were computed to be, $\sim$$17.2$ Jmol$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ and $\sim$34

agreement with the limiting theoretical values. An anomaly is observed in peak

frequency surveys alongwith an ongoing survey with the University of Technology
digital backend for the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (UTMOST) as
well as future observations with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping

more FRBs per day, even in the most extreme scenarios where free-free
absorption and scattering can significantly impact the fluxes below 1~GHz. We
also show that UTMOST will detect 1--2 FRBs per month of observations. For
CHIME and HIRAX, the detection rates also depend greatly on the assumed FRB
distance scale. Some of the models we investigated predict an increase in the
FRB flux as a function of redshift at low frequencies. If FRBs are truly
cosmological sources, this effect may impact future surveys in this band,
particularly if the FRB population traces the cosmic star formation rate.

inflate a giant envelope, and hence the merger remnant stays hot. If our

work is a test of systematic parametrizations of the GSF recommended by the
RIPL-3 data base for the case of $^{208}$Pb. The upward GSF and LD in
$^{208}$Pb are compared to gamma decay data from an Oslo-type experiment to
examine the validity of the Brink-Axel (BA) hypothesis. The E1 and M1 parts of
the total GSF are determined from high-resolution forward angle inelastic
proton scattering data taken at 295 MeV at RCNP, Osaka, Japan. The total LD in
$^{208}$Pb is derived from the $1^-$ LD extracted with a fluctuation analysis
in the energy region of the isovector giant dipole resonance. The E1 GSF is
compared to parametrizations recommended by the RIPL-3 data base showing
systematic deficiencies of all models in the energy region around neutron
threshold. The new data for the poorly known spinflip M1 resonance call for a
substantial revision of the model suggested in RIPL-3. The total GSF derived
from the present data is larger in the PDR energy region than the Oslo data but
the strong fluctuations due to the low LD resulting from the double shell
closure of $^{208}$Pb prevent a conclusion on a possible violation of the BA
hypothesis. Using the parameters suggested by RIPL-3 for a description of the
LD in $^{208}$Pb with the back-shifted Fermi gas model, remarkable agreement
between the two experiments spanning a wide excitation energy range is
obtained. Systematic parametrizations of the E1 and M1 GSF parts need to be
reconsidered at low excitation energies. The good agreement of LD provides an
independent confirmation of the approach underlying the decomposition of GSF
and LDs in Oslo-type experiments.

in a nematic liquid crystal under a shear flow. We find a large repertoire of
possible nonequilibrium steady states as a function of the shear rate and of
the anchoring of the nematic director field at the droplet surface. We first
discuss homeotropic anchoring. For weak anchoring, we recover the typical
behaviour of a sheared isotropic droplet in a binary fluid, which rotates,
stretches and can be broken by the applied flow. For intermediate anchoring,
new possibilities arise due to elastic effects in the nematic fluid. We find
that in this regime the 2D droplet can tilt and move in the flow, or tumble
incessantly at the centre of the channel. For sufficiently strong anchoring,
finally, one or both of the topological defects which form close to the surface
of the isotropic droplet in equilibrium detach from it and get dragged deep
into the nematic state by the flow. In 3D, instead, the Saturn ring associated
with normal anchoring disclination line can be deformed and shifted downstream
by the flow, but remains always localized in proximity of the droplet, at least
for the parameter range we explored. Tangential anchoring in 2D leads to a
different dynamic response, as the boojum defects characteristic of this
situation can unbind from the droplet under a weaker shear with respect to the
normal anchoring case. Our results should stimulate further experiments with
inverted liquid crystal emulsions under shear, as most of the predictions can
be testable in principle by monitoring the evolution of liquid crystalline
orientation patterns or by tracking the position and shape of the droplet over
time.

populations are successively and instantaneously injected into the emission
region, i.e., a magnetized plasmoid propagating along the blazar jet, and
subjected to linear, time-independent synchrotron radiative losses, which are
caused by a constant magnetic field, and nonlinear, time-dependent synchrotron
self-Compton radiative losses in the Thomson limit. Considering a general
multiple-injection scenario is, from a physical point of view, more realistic
than the usual single-injection scenario invoked in common blazar models, as
blazar jets may extend over tens of kiloparsecs and, thus, most likely pick up
several particle populations from intermediate clouds. We analytically compute
the electron number density by solving a kinetic equation using Laplace
transformations and the method of matched asymptotic expansions. Moreover, we
explicitly calculate the optically thin synchrotron intensity, the synchrotron
self-Compton intensity in the Thomson limit, as well as the associated total
fluences. In order to mimic injections of finite duration times and radiative
transport, we model flares by sequences of these instantaneous injections,
suitably distributed over the entire emission region. Finally, we present a
parameter study for the total synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton fluence
spectral energy distributions for a generic three-injection scenario, varying
the magnetic field strength, the Doppler factor, and the initial electron
energy of the first injection in realistic parameter domains, demonstrating

of surfactant suspensions that consist of a general gradient dynamics framework
based on an underlying energy functional. This extends the gradient dynamics
approach to dissipative non-equilibrium thin film systems with several
variables, and casts their dynamic equations into a form that reproduces
Onsager's reciprocity relations. We first discuss the general form of gradient
dynamics models for an arbitrary number of fields and discuss simple well-known
examples with one or two fields. Next, we develop the gradient dynamics (three
field) model for a thin liquid film covered by soluble surfactant and discuss
how it automatically results in consistent convective (driven by pressure
gradients, Marangoni forces and Korteweg stresses), diffusive,
adsorption/desorption, and evaporation fluxes. We then show that in the dilute
limit, the model reduces to the well-known hydrodynamic form that includes
Marangoni fluxes due to a linear equation of state. In this case the energy
functional incorporates wetting energy, surface energy of the free interface
(constant contribution plus an entropic term) and bulk mixing entropy.
Subsequently, as an example, we show how various extensions of the energy
functional result in consistent dynamical models that account for nonlinear
equations of state, concentration-dependent wettability and surfactant and film
bulk decomposition phase transitions. We conclude with a discussion of further
possible extensions towards systems with micelles, surfactant adsorption at the
solid substrate and bioactive behaviour.

effects of an energy/entropy barrier at the EW, and of the long-range

develop a self-consistent approximation to derive for $T_{\ve}$ a general
expression, akin to the celebrated Collins-Kimball relation in chemical

Our analysis reveals that the barrier-induced contribution to $T_{\ve}$ is the

is not ""diffusion-limited"" but rather ""barrier-limited"". We present the
small-$\ve$ expansion for $T_{\ve}$, in which the coefficients in front of the

potential. On example of a triangular-well potential, we show that $T_{\ve}$ is
non-monotonic with respect to the extent of the attractive LRI, being minimal

boundary nor penetrating too deeply into the bulk. Our analytical predictions

neuron. Here, we analyse under which conditions chimera states are present, as
well as the affects induced by intensity of coupling on them. We observe the
existence of chimera states in that incoherent structure can be composed of
desynchronised spikes or desynchronised bursts. Moreover, we find that chimera
states with desynchronised bursts are more robust to neuronal noise than with

ever-increasing capacity demand, its effect on the handover (HO) rate is
overlooked. In dense 5G networks, HO delays may neutralize or even negate the
gains offered by network densification. Hence, user mobility imposes a
nontrivial challenge to harvest capacity gains via network densification. In
this paper, we propose a velocity-aware HO management scheme for two-tier
downlink cellular network to mitigate the HO effect on the foreseen
densification throughput gains. The proposed HO scheme sacrifices the best BS
connectivity, by skipping HO to some BSs along the user's trajectory, to
maintain longer connection durations and reduce HO rates. Furthermore, the
proposed scheme enables cooperative BS service and strongest interference
cancellation to compensate for skipping the best connectivity. To this end, we
consider different HO skipping scenarios and develop a velocity-aware
mathematical model, via stochastic geometry, to quantify the performance of the
proposed HO scheme in terms of the coverage probability and user throughput.
The results highlight the HO rate problem in dense cellular environments and
show the importance of the proposed HO schemes. Finally, the value of BS
cooperation along with handover skipping is quantified for different user
mobility profiles.

probability has a non-exponential form. At asymptotically late times the

We show that at this time region the energy of the false vacuum states tends to
the energy of the true vacuum state as $1/t^{2}$ for $t \to \infty$. This means
that the energy density in the unstable vacuum state should have analogous
properties and hence the cosmological constant $\Lambda = \Lambda (t)$ too. The
conclusion is that $\Lambda$ in the Universe with the unstable vacuum should
have a form of the sum of the ""bare"" cosmological constant and of the term of a
type $1/t^{2}$: $\Lambda(t) \equiv \Lambda_{bare} + d/ t^{2}$ (where

quantum objects: (1) quantum objects run autonomously with system-state update
frequencies based on their local proper times and with either no or minimal
