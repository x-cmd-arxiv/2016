equipped with time travel into the past: that is, closed timelike curves or
CTCs (with no bound on their size). We focus on a model for CTCs due to
Deutsch, which imposes a probabilistic consistency condition to avoid
grandfather paradoxes. Our main result is that computers with CTCs can solve
exactly the problems that are Turing-reducible to the halting problem, and that
this is true whether we consider classical or quantum computers. Previous work,
by Aaronson and Watrous, studied CTC computers with a polynomial size
restriction, and showed that they solve exactly the problems in PSPACE, again
in both the classical and quantum cases.
  Compared to the complexity setting, the main novelty of the computability
setting is that not all CTCs have fixed-points, even probabilistically. Despite
this, we show that the CTCs that do have fixed-points suffice to solve the
halting problem, by considering fixed-point distributions involving infinite
geometric series. The tricky part is to show that even quantum computers with
CTCs can be simulated using a Halt oracle. For that, we need the Riesz
representation theorem from functional analysis, among other tools.
  We also study an alternative model of CTCs, due to Lloyd et al., which uses
postselection to ""simulate"" a consistency condition, and which yields BPP_path
in the classical case or PP in the quantum case when subject to a polynomial
size restriction. With no size limit, we show that postselected CTCs yield only
the computable languages if we impose a certain finiteness condition, or all
languages nonadaptively reducible to the halting problem if we don't.

progressively shifting from logic operations to interconnect energies. Without
the prospect of substantial reduction in energy per bit communicated, we cannot
continue the exponential growth of our use of information. The physics of
optics and optoelectronics fundamentally addresses both interconnect energy and
bandwidth density, and optics may be the only scalable solution to such
problems. Here we summarize the corresponding background, status,
opportunities, and research directions for optoelectronic technology and novel
optics, including sub-femtojoule devices in waveguide and novel 2D array
optical systems. We compare different approaches to low-energy optoelectronic
output devices and their scaling, including lasers, modulators and LEDs,
optical confinement approaches (such as resonators) to enhance effects, and the
benefits of different material choices, including 2D materials and other
quantum-confined structures. Beyond the elimination of line charging by the use
optical connections, the next major interconnect dissipations are in the
electronic circuits for receiver amplifiers, timing recovery and multiplexing.
We can address these through the integration of photodetectors to reduce or
eliminate receiver circuit energies, free-space optics to eliminate the need
for timing and multiplexing circuits (while solving bandwidth density
problems), and using optics generally to save power by running large
synchronous systems. One target concept is interconnects from ~ 1 cm to ~ 10 m

incremental processing in linear time with finite working memory. We suggest
that the Rank Interpretation Architecture and its multilinear properties

unordered lists of key properties or single structural properties at one rank,

size, protein content and cell cycle time. These are global variables that are
the outcome of multiple internal microscopic processes. Accordingly, they
display some universal statistical properties and scaling relations, such as
distribution collapse and relation between moments. Cell size statistics and
its relation to growth and division has been mostly studied separately from
proteins and other cellular variables. Here we present experimental and
theoretical analyses of these phenotype components in a unified framework that
reveals their correlations and interactions inside the cell. We measure these
components simultaneously in single cells over dozens of generations, quantify
their correlations, and compare population to temporal statistics. We find that
cell size and highly expressed proteins have very similar dynamics over growth
and division cycles, which result in parallel statistical properties, both
universal and individual. In particular, while distribution shapes of
fluctuations along time are common to all cells and components, other
properties are variable and remain distinct in individual cells for a
surprisingly large number of generations. These include temporal averages of
cell size and protein content, and the structure of their auto-correlation
functions. We explore possible roles of the different components in controlling
cell growth and division. We find that in order to stabilize exponential
accumulation and division of all components across generations, coupled
dynamics among them is required. Finally, we incorporate effective coupling
within the cell cycle with a phenomenological mapping across consecutive
cycles, and show that this model reproduces the entire array of experimental
observations.

the current generation of deep learning techniques. For example, they require
very large datasets to work effectively, entailing that they are slow to learn
even when such datasets are available. Moreover, they lack the ability to

identified by systematic computations for different spin quantum numbers $S$

Kondo model. We demonstrate that, besides the conventional precessional motion
and relaxation, the quantum-spin dynamics shows nutation, similar to a spinning
top. Opposed to semiclassical theory, however, the nutation is efficiently
damped on an extremely short time scale. The effect is explained in the
large-$S$ limit as quantum dephasing of the eigenmodes in an emergent two-spin
model that is weakly entangled with the bulk of the system. We argue that,
apart from the Kondo effect, the damping of nutational motion is essentially
the only characteristics of the quantum nature of the spin. Qualitative
agreement between quantum and semiclassical spin dynamics is found down to
$S=1/2$.

  Perspective","11 pages, 8 figures, conference",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ensemble methods for classification and clustering have been effectively used
for decades, while ensemble learning for outlier detection has only been
studied recently. In this work, we design a new ensemble approach for outlier
detection in multi-dimensional point data, which provides improved accuracy by
reducing error through both bias and variance. Although classification and
outlier detection appear as different problems, their theoretical underpinnings
are quite similar in terms of the bias-variance trade-off [1], where outlier
detection is considered as a binary classification task with unobserved labels
but a similar bias-variance decomposition of error.
  In this paper, we propose a sequential ensemble approach called CARE that
employs a two-phase aggregation of the intermediate results in each iteration
to reach the final outcome. Unlike existing outlier ensembles which solely
incorporate a parallel framework by aggregating the outcomes of independent
base detectors to reduce variance, our ensemble incorporates both the parallel
and sequential building blocks to reduce bias as well as variance by ($i$)
successively eliminating outliers from the original dataset to build a better
data model on which outlierness is estimated (sequentially), and ($ii$)
combining the results from individual base detectors and across iterations
(parallelly). Through extensive experiments on sixteen real-world datasets
mainly from the UCI machine learning repository [2], we show that CARE performs
significantly better than or at least similar to the individual baselines. We
also compare CARE with the state-of-the-art outlier ensembles where it also
provides significant improvement when it is the winner and remains close
otherwise.

protected by the coexistence of time-reversal and inversion symmetries with
negligible spin-orbit coupling. We argue that strong correlation effects occur
at the surface of such systems for relatively small Hubbard interaction $U$,
due to the narrow bandwidth of the ""drumhead"" surface states. In the
Hartree-Fock approximation, at small $U$ we obtain a surface ferromagnetic
phase through a continuous quantum phase transition characterized by the
surface-mode divergence of the spin susceptibility, while the bulk states
remain very robust against local interactions and remain non-ordered. At
slightly increased interaction strength, the system quickly changes from a
surface ferromagnetic phase to a surface charge-ordered phase through a
first-order transition. When Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling is applied to the
surface states, a canted ferromagnetic phase occurs at the surface for
intermediate values of $U$. The quantum critical behavior of the surface
ferromagnetic transition is nontrivial in the sense that the surface spin order
parameter couple to Fermi-surface excitations from both surface and bulk
states. This leads to unconventional Landau damping and consequently a na\""ive
dynamical critical exponent $z\!\approx\!1$ when the Fermi level is close to
the bulk nodal energy. We also show that, already without interactions, quantum
oscillations arise due to bulk states, despite the absence of a Fermi surface
when the chemical potential is tuned to the energy of the nodal loop. The bulk
magnetic susceptibility diverges logarithmically whenever the nodal loop
exactly overlaps with a quantized magnetic orbit in the bulk Brillouin zone.
These correlation and transport phenomena are unique signatures of nodal loop
states.

temperatures above the structural phase transition, rather than two as
predicted by the factor group analysis for the assumed $P\bar{3}m1$ symmetry.
This indicates that the actual symmetry of the high temperature phase is lower
than previously thought.\ Observation of an additional E$_g$ mode at high
temperature can be explained by doubling of the original trigonal unit cell
along the $c$-axis and within the $P\bar{3}c1$ symmetry.\ In the low
temperature regime (below 245 K) the new Raman modes appear as a consequence of
the symmetry lowering phase transition and corresponding increase of the

can be assigned within the monoclinic crystal symmetry.\ Temperature dependence
of the Raman active phonons in both phases are mainly driven by anharmonicity
effects. The results call for reconsideration of the crystallographic phases of

results due to Cong et al. We establish theorems that generalize in several
ways many previous results in the specialized literature, including those of

convergence and robustness of such schemes, that up to date remain unsolved

diversity in the areas of expertise within research labs and groups. This also
have brought changes to the role researchers in scientific works. As a
consequence, multi-authored scientific papers have now became a norm for high
quality research. Unfortunately, such a phenomenon induces bias to existing
metrics employed to evaluate the productivity and success of researchers. While
some metrics were adapted to account for the rank of authors in a paper, many
journals are now requiring a description of the specific roles of each author
in a publication. Surprisingly, the investigation of the relationship between
the rank of authors and their contributions has been limited to a few studies.
By analyzing such kind of data, here we show, quantitatively, that the
regularity in the authorship contributions decreases with the number of authors
in a paper. Furthermore, we found that the rank of authors and their roles in
papers follows three general patterns according to the nature of their
contributions, such as writing, data analysis, and the conduction of
experiments. This was accomplished by collecting and analyzing the data
retrieved from PLoS ONE and by devising an entropy-based measurement to
quantify the effective number of authors in a paper according to their
contributions. The analysis of such patterns confirms that some aspects of the
author ranking are in accordance with the expected convention, such as the fact
that the first and last authors are more likely to contribute more in a
scientific work. Conversely, such analysis also revealed that authors in the
intermediary positions of the rank contribute more in certain specific roles,
such as the task of collecting data. This indicates that the an unbiased
evaluation of researchers must take into account the distinct types of
scientific contributions.

""classical"" COCOMO (parametric estimation over a pre-determined set of
attributes) to ""modern"" (reasoning via analogy using spectral-based clustering
plus instance and feature selection, and a recent ""baseline method"" proposed in
ACM Transactions on Software Engineering).Secondly, catalog the list of

strongly recommend (i) using that data and (ii) use COCOMO to generate
predictions. We say this since the experiments of this paper show that, at
least for effort estimation,how data is collected is more important than what

approximately mutually exclusive (anti-co-occurring) within the TCGA Pancancer

show how a new Mutation anti-co-OCcurrence Algorithm (MOCA) provides an
effective greedy search and testing algorithm with guaranteed control of the
familywise error rate or false discovery rate, by combining some
under-appreciated ideas from frequentist hypothesis testing. These ideas
include: (a) A novel exact conditional test for the tendency of multiple sets
to have a large/small union/intersection, which generalises Fisher's exact test
of 2x2 tables. (b) Randomised hypothesis tests for discrete distributions. (c)
Stouffer's method for combining p-values. (d) Weighted multiple hypothesis
testing. A new approach to setting a-priori weights which generates additional
implicit hypothesis tests is suggested, and allows us to preserve almost all
statistical power when testing pairs despite introducing a combinatorially
large number of additional hypotheses.

exploitative or apparent competition. We examine whether evolution of the
shared species acts as a coexistence mechanism and to what extent the answer
depends on the genetic architecture underlying trait evolution. In our models
of exploitative and apparent competition, the shared species evolves its
defense or prey use. Evolving species are either haploid or diploid. A single
locus pleiotropically determines prey nutritional quality and predator attack
rates. When pleiotropy is sufficiently antagonistic (e.g. nutritional prey are
harder to capture), eco-evolutionary assembly culminates in one of two stable
states supporting only two species. When pleiotropy is weakly antagonistic or
synergistic, assembly is intransitive: species-genotype pairs are cyclically
displaced by rare invasions of the missing genotypes or species. This
intransitivity allows for coexistence if, along its equilibria, the geometric
mean of recovery rates exceeds the geometric mean of loss rates of the rare
genotypes or species. By affecting these rates, synergistic pleiotropy can
mediate coexistence, while antagonistic pleiotropy does not. For diploid
populations experiencing weak antagonistic pleiotropy, superadditive allelic
contributions to fitness can mitigate coexistence via an eco-evolutionary
storage effect. Density-dependence and mutations also promote coexistence.
These results highlight how the efficacy of evolution as a coexistence
mechanism may depend on the underlying genetic architecture.

spiked random matrix models, in which a prominent eigenvector is planted into a
random matrix. These distributions form natural statistical models for
principal component analysis (PCA) problems throughout the sciences. Baik, Ben
Arous and P\'ech\'e showed that the spiked Wishart ensemble exhibits a sharp
phase transition asymptotically: when the signal strength is above a critical
threshold, it is possible to detect the presence of a spike based on the top
eigenvalue, and below the threshold the top eigenvalue provides no information.
Such results form the basis of our understanding of when PCA can detect a
low-rank signal in the presence of noise.
  However, not all the information about the spike is necessarily contained in
the spectrum. We study the fundamental limitations of statistical methods,
including non-spectral ones. Our results include:
  I) For the Gaussian Wigner ensemble, we show that PCA achieves the optimal
detection threshold for a variety of benign priors for the spike. We extend
previous work on the spherically symmetric and i.i.d. Rademacher priors through
an elementary, unified analysis.
  II) For any non-Gaussian Wigner ensemble, we show that PCA is always
suboptimal for detection. However, a variant of PCA achieves the optimal
threshold (for benign priors) by pre-transforming the matrix entries according
to a carefully designed function. This approach has been stated before, and we
give a rigorous and general analysis.
  III) For both the Gaussian Wishart ensemble and various synchronization
problems over groups, we show that inefficient procedures can work below the
threshold where PCA succeeds, whereas no known efficient algorithm achieves
this. This conjectural gap between what is statistically possible and what can

zero-thickness Huygens' metasurfaces based on Generalized Sheet Transition
Conditions (GSTCs), is proposed and demonstrated using full-wave simulations.
The Huygens' metasurface is modelled using electric and magnetic surface
susceptibilities, which are found to follow a double-Lorentz dispersion
profile. To solve zero-thickness Huygens' metasurface problems for general
broadband excitations, the double-Lorentz dispersion profile is combined with
GSTCs, leading to a set of first-order differential fields equations in
time-domain. Identifying the exact equivalence between Huygens' metasurfaces
and coupled RLC oscillator circuits, the field equations are then subsequently
solved using standard circuit modelling techniques based on a finite-difference
formulation. Several examples including generalized refraction are shown to
illustrate the temporal evolution of scattered fields from the Huygens'
metasurface under plane-wave normal incidence, in both harmonic steady-state
and broadband regimes. In particular, due to its inherent time-domain
formulation, a significant strength of the methodology is its ability to model
time-varying metasurfaces, which is demonstrated with a simple example of a
pumped metasurface leading to new frequency generation and wave amplification.

the massless Dirac fermions are confined to live on the one-dimensional
boundary, while the (virtual) photons of the U(1) gauge field are free to
propagate in all the three spatial dimensions that represent the physical space

protocol, we find the optimal BS beamwidth and observe that in terms of initial
access delay it is decreasing as blockage becomes more severe, but is
relatively constant (about $\pi/12$) for UPT. Of the considered protocols, the
best trade-off between initial access delay and UPT is achieved under a fast

coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators changes from continuous to discontinuous when
the nature of the coupling is moved from diffusive to reactive. We explain this
drastic qualitative change as resulting from the co-existence of a particular
synchronized macrostate together with the trivial incoherent macrostate, in a
range of parameter values for which the later is linearly stable. In contrast
to the paradigmatic Kuramoto model, this particular state observed at the
synchronization transition contains a finite, non-vanishing number of
synchronized oscillators, which results in a discontinuous transition. We
consider successively two situations where either a fully synchronized state or
a partially synchronized state exist at the transition. Thermodynamic limit and
finite size effects are briefly discussed, as well as connections with recently
observed discontinuous transitions.

a recent state-of-the-art convolutional network for slidingwindow detection
[10] to provide detection and rough pose estimation in a single shot, without
intermediate stages of detecting parts or initial bounding boxes. While not the
first system to treat pose estimation as a categorization problem, this is the

a deep learning approach. The key to the architecture is a deep convolutional

expansion in the system-bath coupling, we adopt the polaron transformation to
the Hamiltonian and identify the tunneling term as a perturbation with the
system-bath coupling being treated nonperturbatively, herein termed the
polaron-transformed NEGF method. To evaluate terms in the Dyson series, we
further utilize the Majorana-fermion representation. The proposed method not
only allows us to deal with weak as well as strong coupling regime, but also
enables an investigation on the role of bias. As an application of the method,
we study the energy transfer between two Ohmic bosonic baths mediated by a
spin. For a unbiased spin system, our energy current result smoothly bridges
predictions of two benchmarks, namely, the quantum master equation and the
nonequilibrium non-interacting blip approximation, thus our method is beyond
existing theories. In case of a biased spin system, we reveal a bias-induced
nonmomotonic behavior of the energy conductance in the intermediate coupling
regime, due to the resonant character of the energy transfer. This finding may
offer a nontrivial quantum control knob over energy transfer at the nanoscale.

quantum systems (e.g.\ a Josephson junction made of two Bose-Einstein
condensates or two spin states of an ensemble of trapped ions) subject to a
weak continuous measurement. If the coupling between the two systems is
suddenly switched on the resulting dynamics leads to caustics (fold and cusp
catastrophes) in the number-difference probability distribution, and at the
same time the measurement gradually induces a quantum-to-classical transition.
Decoherence is often invoked to help resolve paradoxes associated with
macroscopic quantum mechanics, but here, on the contrary, caustics are
well-behaved in the quantum (many-particle) theory and divergent in the
classical (mean-field) theory. Caustics thus represent a breakdown of the
classical theory towards which decoherence seems to inevitably lead. We find
that measurement backaction plays a crucial role in softening the resulting
singularities and calculate the modification to the Arnol'd index which governs
the scaling of the caustic's amplitude with the number of atoms. The Arnol'd
index acts as a critical exponent for the formation of singularities during
quantum dynamics and its modification by the open nature of the system is
analogous to the modification of the critical exponents of phase transitions
occurring in open systems.

the presence of distributed time-delays does not change the behavior of the
synchronization transition significantly, vis-a-vis networks with constant
time-delay, where the value of the constant time-delay is the mean of the
distributed delays. We also notice that a normal distribution of delays gives
rise to a transition at marginally lower coupling strengths, vis-a-vis
uniformly distributed delays. These trends hold across classes of networks and
for varying standard deviations of the delay distribution, indicating the
generality of these results. So we conclude that distributed delays, which may
be typically expected in real-world situations, do not have a notable effect on
synchronization. This allows results obtained with constant delays to remain
relevant even in the case of randomly distributed delays.

p nucleus 124Xe. Since the stellar rate for this reaction cannot be determined
by a measurement directly, the aim of the present work was to measure the cross
section of the inverse 124Xe(a,g)128Ba reaction and to compare the results with
statistical model predictions. Of great importance is the fact that data below
the (a,n) threshold was obtained. Studying simultaneously the 124Xe(a,n)127Ba
reaction channel at higher energy allowed to further identify the source of a
discrepancy between data and prediction. The 124Xe + alpha cross sections were
measured with the activation method using a thin window 124Xe gas cell. The
studied energy range was between E = 11 and 15 MeV close above the
astrophysically relevant energy range. The obtained cross sections are compared
with statistical model calculations. The experimental cross sections are
smaller than standard predictions previously used in astrophysical
calculations. As dominating source of the difference, the theoretical alpha
width was identified. The experimental data suggest an alpha width lower by at
least a factor of 0.125 in the astrophysical energy range. An upper limit for
the 128Ba(g,a)124Xe stellar rate was inferred from our measurement. The impact
of this rate was studied in two different models for core-collapse supernova
explosions of 25 solar mass stars. A significant contribution to the 124Xe
abundance via this reaction path would only be possible when the rate was
increased above the previous standard value. Since the experimental data rule
this out, they also demonstrate the closure of this production path.

therefore consistent with a high mean-free path of UV photons in the

redundancies in ontologies. We try to extend the known decidability results for
unification in the Description Logic $\mathcal{EL}$ to disunification since
negative constraints can be used to avoid unwanted unifiers. While decidability
of the solvability of general $\mathcal{EL}$-disunification problems remains an
open problem, we obtain NP-completeness results for two interesting special
cases: dismatching problems, where one side of each negative constraint must be
ground, and local solvability of disunification problems, where we consider
only solutions that are constructed from terms occurring in the input problem.
More precisely, we first show that dismatching can be reduced to local
disunification, and then provide two complementary NP-algorithms for finding
local solutions of disunification problems.

  help-or-escape social dilemma","21 pages, 4 figures","Scientific Reports 6, 33417 (2016)",,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although cooperation is central to the organisation of many social systems,
relatively little is known about cooperation in situations of collective
emergency. When groups of people flee from a danger such as a burning building
or a terrorist attack, the collective benefit of cooperation is important, but
the cost of helping is high and the temptation to defect is strong. To explore
the degree of cooperation in emergencies, we develop a new social game, the
help-or-escape social dilemma. Under time and monetary pressure, players decide
how much risk they are willing to take in order to help others. Results
indicated that players took as much risk to help others during emergencies as
they did under normal conditions. In both conditions, most players applied an
egalitarian heuristic and helped others until their chance of success equalled
that of the group. This strategy is less efficient during emergencies, however,
because the increased time pressure results in fewer people helped.
Furthermore, emergencies tend to amplify participants initial tendency to
cooperate, with prosocials becoming even more cooperative and individualists
becoming even more selfish. Our framework offers new opportunities to study
human cooperation and could help authorities to better manage crowd behaviours
during mass emergencies.

zigzag atomic chain of graphene. In the former case non-propagating DBs are
excited on the atoms next to the driven atoms, while in the latter case the
excited DBs propagate along the nanoribbon. The energy transfer along the
nanoribbon assisted by the DBs is investigated in detail and the differences
between harmonic displacement driving and harmonic force driving are discussed.
It is concluded that the amplitude of external driving at out of phonon

energy transfer to the system. Overall, our results suggest that external
harmonic driving even at relatively small driving amplitudes can be used to
control excitation of DBs and consequently the energy transfer to the system.

combinatorial formula for the $(n-1)$th Steifel Whitney class. In particular,
we show that if a Bott tower is orientable then the $(n-1)$th Steifel Whitney

Learmonth radio station and was associated with a limb CME occurring on 2014
January 8 observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The evolution of the CME in the inner corona
presents a double-layered structure that propagates outward. We fit the outer
layer of the structure with a partial circle and divide it into 7 directions
from -45$^\circ$ to 45$^\circ$ with an angular separation of 15$^\circ$. We
measure the outer layer speed along the 7 directions, and find that the speed
in the direction of -15$^\circ$ with respect to the central direction is the
fastest. We use the differential emission measure (DEM) method to calculate the
physical parameters at the outer layer at the moment when the type II radio
burst was initiated, including the temperature ($T$), emission measure ($EM$),
temperature ratio ($T_{d}/T_{u}$), compression ratio ($X$), and Alfv\'en Mach
number ($M_{A}$). We compare the quantities $X$ and $M_{A}$ to that obtained
from band-splitting in the radio spectrum, and find that this type II radio
burst is generated at a small region of the outer layer that is located at the
sector in 45$^\circ$ direction. The results suggest that the generation of type
II radio bursts (shock) requires larger values of $X$ and $M_{A}$ rather than
simply a higher speed of the disturbance.

radius defined according to the stationarity interval. The overlap between
auras determines the share of common clusters among users. To model
non-stationarities across a massive array, sub-arrays are defined for which
clusters are independently generated. At last, we describe a procedure to
incorporate spherical wave modelling, where a cluster focal point is defined to
account for distance between user and cluster.

interest due to its robust direct band gap and high charge mobility. Currently,
however, phosphorene can only be produced by mechanical or liquid exfoliation,
and it is still a significant challenge to directly epitaxially grow
phosphorene, which greatly hinders its mass production and, thus, applications.
In epitaxial growth, the stability of nanoscale cluster or flake on a substrate
is crucial. Here, we perform ab initio energy optimizations and molecular
dynamics simulations to explore the critical role of substrate on the stability
of a representative phosphorene flake. Our calculations show that the stability
of the phosphorene nanoflake is strongly dependent on the interaction strength
between the nanoflake and substrate. Specifically, the strong interaction (0.75
eV/P atom) with Cu(111) substrate breaks up the phosphorene nanoflake, while
the weak interaction (0.063 eV/P atom) with h-BN substrate fails to stabilize
its 2D structure. Remarkably, we find that a substrate with a moderate
interaction (about 0.35 eV/P atom) is able to stabilize the 2D characteristics
of the nanoflake on a realistic time scale. Our findings here provide useful
guidelines for searching suitable substrates for the directly epitaxial growth
of phosphorene.

representations of speech utterances in an attempt to encode information about

for the task of DID. The aim of this paper is to construct a single VSM that
encodes information about spoken dialects from both the Phonotactic and
Acoustic VSMs. Given the two views of the data, we make use of a well known
multi-view dimensionality reduction technique known as Canonical Correlation
Analysis (CCA), to form a single vector representation for each speech
utterance that encodes dialect specific discriminative information from both
the phonetic and acoustic representations. We refer to this approach as feature
space combination approach and show that our CCA based feature vector
representation performs better on the Arabic DID task than the phonetic and
acoustic feature representations used alone. We also present the feature space
combination approach as a viable alternative to the model based combination
approach, where two DID systems are built using the two VSMs (Phonotactic and
Acoustic) and the final prediction score is the output score combination from
the two systems.

converge to a vertical helicoid. Since Riemann's minimal examples are
topologically planar domains that are periodic with the fundamental domains for

punctured in a single point, then topologically each of these surfaces is
diffeomorphic to the unique genus zero surface with two limit ends. Also he
described his surfaces analytically in terms of elliptic functions on
rectangular elliptic curves. This article exams Riemann's original proof of the

been neglected in the literature, despite the fact that it can be significant,
with substantial impact on consequent decisions. An apparent reason is that no
widely used general method for estimating the error seems to be available at
the moment.
  This paper provides a practically applicable method that allows calculating
an upper bound for the maximal error induced by approximating a coherent lower
probability with its values on a finite set of gambles. An algorithm is also
provided with an estimation of its computational complexity.

The growth procedure is an adaptation of the breadth-first-search which
efficiently manages to find open ears. Further, a heuristic function is defined
for selecting the best ear out of a list of candidates. The performance of the
basic approach is improved by adding a correction procedure which removes
unnecessary nodes from a generated solution. Finally, randomization is included

We present new unresolved multi-band photometry during the 2014-16 eclipse, new
emission line spectroscopy before and during the dimming, archive infrared
photometry between 2014-15, as well as an overview of literature data.
  Spectral observations were carried out with the Fibre-fed RObotic Dual-beam
Optical Spectrograph on the Liverpool Telescope. Photometric monitoring was
done with the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network and James
Gregory Telescope. Our photometry shows that RW Aur dropped in brightness to R
= 12.5 in March 2016. In addition to the long-term dimming trend, RW Aur is
variable on time scales as short as hours. The short-term variation is most
likely due to an unstable accretion flow. This, combined with the presence of
accretion-related emission lines in the spectra suggest that accretion flows in
the binary system are at least partially visible during the eclipse.
  The equivalent width of [O I] increases by a factor of ten in 2014,
coinciding with the dimming event, confirming previous reports. The
blue-shifted part of the $H\alpha$ profile is suppressed during the eclipse. In
combination with the increase in mid-infrared brightness during the eclipse
reported in the literature and seen in WISE archival data, and constraints on
the geometry of the disk around RW Aur A we arrive at the conclusion that the
obscuring screen is part of a wind emanating from the inner disk.

center region is better compared to the cell edge region. In heterogeneous
networks (HetNets), the uncoordinated channel access by different types of base
stations determine the interference statistics that further arbitrates the
coverage probability. Thus, the spectrum allocation techniques have major
impact on the performance of CCU and CEU. In this paper, the performance of
CCUs and CEUs in a random two-tier network is studied for two spectrum
allocation techniques namely: 1) co-channel (CSA), and 2) shared (SSA). For
performance analysis, the widely accepted conception of modeling the tiers of
HetNet using independent homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) is considered
to accommodate the spatial randomness in location of BSs. To incorporate the
spatial randomness in the arrival of service and to aid the load-aware
analysis, the cellular traffic is modeled using spatio-temporal PPP. Under this
scenario, we have developed an analytical framework to evaluate the load-aware
performance, including coverage and blocking probabilities, of CCUs and CEUs
under both spectrum allocation techniques. Further, we provide insight into
achievable area energy efficiency for SSA and CSA. The developed analytical
framework is validated through extensive simulations. Next, we demonstrate the
impact of traffic load and femto access points density on the performance of
CCUs/CEUs under CSA and SSA.

transcription, phosphotransfer, and intracellular transport, biological
""particles"" move along some kind of ""tracks"". The motion of these particles can
be modeled as a one-dimensional movement along an ordered sequence of sites.
The biological particles (e.g., ribosomes, RNAPs, phosphate groups, motor
proteins) have volume and cannot surpass one another. In some cases, there is a
preferred direction of movement along the track, but in general the movement
may be two-directional, and furthermore the particles may attach or detach from
various regions along the tracks (e.g. ribosomes may drop off the mRNA molecule
before reaching a stop codon). We derive a new deterministic mathematical model
for such transport phenomena that may be interpreted as the dynamic mean-field
approximation of an important model from mechanical statistics called the
asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with Langmuir kinetics. Using tools
from the theory of monotone dynamical systems and contraction theory we show
that the model admits a unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. This
means that the occupancy in all the sites along the lattice converges to a
steady-state value that depends on the parameters but not on the initial
conditions. We also show that the model entrains (or phase locks) to periodic
excitations in any of its forward, backward, attachment, or detachment rates.
We demonstrate an application of this phenomenological transport model for
analyzing the effect of ribosome drop off in mRNA translation. One may perhaps
expect that drop off from a jammed site may increase the total flow by reducing
congestion. Our results show that this is not true. Drop off has a substantial
effect on the flow, yet always leads to a reduction in the steady-state protein
production rate.

the hardware complexity and power consumption has been proposed as a potential
candidate for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. Exploiting the sparse
nature of the mmWave channel, compressive sensing (CS)-based channel estimators
have been proposed. When applied to real mmWave channels, the CS-based channel
estimators may encounter heavy computational burden due to the high
dimensionality of the basis. Meanwhile, knowledge about the response of the
antenna array, which is needed for constructing the basis of the CS estimators,
may not be perfect due to array uncertainties such as phase mismatch among
array elements. This can result in the loss of sparse representation and hence
the degraded performance of the CS estimator. In this paper, we propose a novel
matrix completion (MC)-based low-complexity channel estimator. The proposed
scheme is compatible with switch-based hybrid structures, does not need to
specify a basis, and can avoid the basis mismatch issue. Compared with the
existing CS-based estimator, the proposed basis-free scheme is immune to array
response mismatch and exhibits a significantly lower complexity.

the correlation is consistent with the stochastic acceleration mechanisms and

to timely detect hijacks on its own prefixes, and automatically proceed to
mitigation actions. To evaluate the performance of ARTEMIS, we conduct real
hijacking experiments. To our best knowledge, it is the first time that a
hijacking detection/mitigation system is evaluated through extensive
experiments in the real Internet. Our results (a) show that ARTEMIS can detect
(mitigate) a hijack within a few seconds (minutes) after it has been launched,
and (b) demonstrate the efficiency of the different control-plane sources used
by ARTEMIS, towards monitoring routing changes.

\textit{Fermi} TeV BL Lacs in the frame of a one-zone leptonic synchrotron
self-Compton model. Our main results are the following: (i) There is a negative
correlation between $B$ and $\delta$ in our sample, which suggests that $B$ and
$\delta$ are dependent on each other mainly in Thomson regime. (ii) There are
negative correlations between $\nu_{\text{sy}}$ and $r$, the $\nu_{\text{IC}}$
and $r$, which is a signature of the energy-dependence statistical acceleration
or the stochastic acceleration. There is a significant correlation between $r$
and $s$, which suggests that the curvature of the electron energy distribution
is attributed to the energy-dependence statistical acceleration mechanism.
(iii) By assuming one proton per relativistic electron, we estimate the jet
power and radiative power. A size relation $P_{\text{e}} \sim P_{\text{p}} >
P_{\text{r}} \gtrsim P_{\text{B}}$ is found in our sample. The
$P_{\text{e}}>P_{\text{B}}$ suggests that the jets are particle dominated, and
the $P_{\text{e}}\sim P_{\text{p}}$ means that the mean energy of relativistic
electrons approaches $m_{\text{p}}/m_{\text{e}}$. There are not significant
correlations between $P_{\text{jet}}$ and black hole mass in high or low state
with a sub-sample of 18 sources, which suggests that the jet power weakly
depends on the black hole mass. (iv) There is a correlation between the changes
in the flux density at 1 TeV and the changes in the $\gamma_{\text{peak}}$,
which suggests the change/evolution of electron energy distribution may be
mainly responsible for the flux variation.

an accreting neutron star, which has a $P=1.37$ s spin period, and is spinning
up at a rate $\dot{P}=-2.0\times 10^{-10}~\rm s\,s^{-1}$. Interestingly, its
isotropic X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm iso}=1.8\times 10^{40}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$
during outbursts is 100 times the Eddington limit for a $1.4~\rm M_{\odot}$
neutron star. In this Letter, based on the standard accretion model we attempt
to constrain the dipolar magnetic field of the pulsar in ULX M82 X-2. Our
calculations indicate that the accretion rate at the magnetospheric radius must
be super-Eddington during outbursts. To support such a super-Eddington
accretion, a relatively high multipole field ($\ga 10^{13}$ G) near the surface
of the accretor is invoked to produce an accreting gas column. However, our
constraint shows that the surface dipolar magnetic field of the pulsar should
be in the range of $1.0-3.5\times 10^{12}$ G. Therefore, our model supports
that the neutron star in ULX M82 X-2 could be a low magnetic field magnetar
(proposed by Tong) with a normal dipolar field ($\sim 10^{12}$ G) and
relatively strong multipole field. For the large luminosity variations of this
source, our scenario can also present a self-consistency interpretation.

highest amount of energy is consumed during usage phase. The study considers
bandwidth, link load and traffic matrices as input parameters which have the
highest contribution to energy footprints of network switches during usage
phase and energy consumption as output. Then with the objective of reducing
energy usage of network infrastructure, the feasibility of putting Ethernet
switches hibernate or sleep mode was investigated. After that, the network

approaches are clearly dominated by patch-based non-local methods in recent
years. In this paper, we aim to propose a local Poisson denoising model with
both structure simplicity and good performance. To this end, we consider a
variational modeling to integrate the so-called Fields of Experts (FoE) image
prior, that has proven an effective higher-order Markov Random Fields (MRF)
model for many classic image restoration problems. We exploit several feasible
variational variants for this task. We start with a direct modeling in the
original image domain by taking into account the Poisson noise statistics,
which performs generally well for the cases of high SNR. However, this strategy
encounters problem in cases of low SNR. Then we turn to an alternative modeling
strategy by using the Anscombe transform and Gaussian statistics derived data
term. We retrain the FoE prior model directly in the transform domain. With the
newly trained FoE model, we end up with a local variational model providing
strongly competitive results against state-of-the-art non-local approaches,
meanwhile bearing the property of simple structure. Furthermore, our proposed
model comes along with an additional advantage, that the inference is very
efficient as it is well-suited for parallel computation on GPUs. For images of

produce state-of-the-art Poisson denoising performance.

different heights in the solar atmosphere, and provide a detailed physical
interpretation of the calculated Stokes profiles. We find that in strong
resonance lines sensitive to PRD effects the magneto-optical terms of the
Stokes-vector transfer equation produce conspicuous U/I wing signals along with
a very interesting magnetic sensitivity in the wings of the linear polarization
profiles. We also show that the weak-field approximation has to be used with
caution when PRD effects are considered.

partial differential equations. It focuses on a Korteweg-de Vries equation,
which is a nonlinear mathematical model of waves on shallow water surfaces. Two
different types of saturated controls are considered. The well-posedness is
proven applying a Banach fixed point theorem, using some estimates of this
equation and some properties of the saturation function. The proof of the
asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is separated in two cases: i)
when the control acts on all the domain, a Lyapunov function together with a
sector condition describing the saturating input is used to conclude on the
stability, ii) when the control is localized, we argue by contradiction. Some
numerical simulations illustrate the stability of the closed-loop nonlinear
partial differential equation. 1. Introduction. In recent decades, a great
effort has been made to take into account input saturations in control designs
(see e.g [39], [15] or more recently [17]). In most applications, actuators are
limited due to some physical constraints and the control input has to be
bounded. Neglecting the amplitude actuator limitation can be source of
undesirable and catastrophic behaviors for the closed-loop system. The standard
method to analyze the stability with such nonlinear controls follows a two
steps design. First the design is carried out without taking into account the
saturation. In a second step, a nonlinear analysis of the closed-loop system is
made when adding the saturation. In this way, we often get local stabilization
results. Tackling this particular nonlinearity in the case of finite
dimensional systems is already a difficult problem. However, nowadays, numerous
techniques are available (see e.g. [39, 41, 37]) and such systems can be
analyzed with an appropriate Lyapunov function and a sector condition of the
saturation map, as introduced in [39]. In the literature, there are few papers
studying this topic in the infinite dimensional case. Among them, we can cite
[18], [29], where a wave equation equipped with a saturated distributed
actuator is studied, and [12], where a coupled PDE/ODE system modeling a
switched power converter with a transmission line is considered. Due to some
restrictions on the system, a saturated feedback has to be designed in the
latter paper. There exist also some papers using the nonlinear semigroup theory
and focusing on abstract systems ([20],[34],[36]). Let us note that in [36],
[34] and [20], the study of a priori bounded controller is tackled using
abstract nonlinear theory. To be more specific, for bounded ([36],[34]) and
unbounded ([34]) control operators, some conditions are derived to deduce, from
the asymptotic stability of an infinite-dimensional linear system in abstract
form, the asymptotic stability when closing the loop with saturating
controller. These articles use the nonlinear semigroup theory (see e.g. [24] or
[1]). The Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV for short)

This star was a target in our program to search for planets around a sample of
95 giant stars observed with Kepler. This detection was made possible using
precise stellar radial velocity measurements of HD 175370 taken over five years
and four months using the coude echelle spectrograph of the 2-m Alfred Jensch
Telescope and the fibre-fed echelle spectrograph HERMES of the 1.2-m Mercator
Telescope. Our radial velocity measurements reveal a periodic (349.5 days)
variation with a semi-amplitude K = 133 m/s, superimposed on a long-term trend.
A low-mass stellar companion with an orbital period of ~88 years in a highly
eccentric orbit and a planet in a Keplerian orbit with an eccentricity e = 0.22
are the most plausible explanation of the radial velocity variations. However,
we cannot exclude the existence of stellar envelope pulsations as a cause for
the low-amplitude radial velocity variations and only future continued
monitoring of this system may answer this uncertainty. From Kepler photometry
we find that HD 175370 is most likely a low-mass red-giant branch or
asymptotic-giant branch star.

optical systems is presented. The approach is statistical in nature, where
information about an object under investigation is discovered, by examining
deviations from a known reference statistical distribution. A Fourier optics
framework and a scalar description of the propagation of monochromatic light is
initially assumed. An object (belonging to a known class of objects) is
illuminated with a speckle field and the intensity of the resulting scattered
optical field is detected at a series of spatial locations by point square law
detectors. A new speckle field is generated (with a new diffuser) and the
object is again illuminated and the intensities are again measured and noted.
By making a large number of these statistical measurements - an ensemble
averaging process (which in general can be a temporal or a spatial averaging
process) - it is possible to determine the statistical relationship between the
intensities detected in different locations with a known statistical certainty.
It is shown how this physical property of the optical system can be used to
identify different classes of objects (discrete objects or objects that vary
continuously as a function of several physical parameters) with a specific
statistical certainty. The derived statistical relationship is a fourth order
statistical process and is related to the mutual intensity of scattered light.
A connection between the integration time of the intensity detectors and
temporal coherence and hence temporal bandwidth of a quasi-monochromatic light
source is discussed. We extend these results to multiple wavelengths and
polarizations of light. We briefly discuss how the results may be extended to
non-paraxial optical systems.

mathematical model of the idiotypic network. A node in the network represents a
clone of B-lymphocytes and its antibodies of the same idiotype which is encoded
by a bitstring. The links between nodes represent possible interactions between
clones of almost complementary idiotype. A clone survives only if the number of
populated neighbored nodes is neither too small nor too large. The dynamics is
driven by the influx of lymphocytes with randomly generated idiotype from the
bone marrow. Previous work has revealed that the network evolves towards a
highly organized modular architecture, characterized by groups of nodes which
share statistical properties. The structural properties of the architecture can
be described analytically, the statistical properties determined from
simulations are confirmed by a modular mean-field theory. To model the presence
of self we permanently occupy one or several nodes. These nodes influence their
linked neighbors, the autoreactive clones, but are themselves not affected by
idiotypic interactions. The architecture is very similar to the case without
self, but organized such that the neighbors of self are only weakly occupied,
thus providing self-tolerance. This supports the perspective that self-reactive
clones, which regularly occur in healthy organisms, are controlled by
anti-idiotypic clones. We discuss how perturbations, like an infection with
foreign antigen, a change in the influx of new idiotypes, or the random removal
of idiotypes, may lead to autoreactivity and devise protocols which cause a
reconstitution of the self-tolerant state. The results could be helpful to
understand network and probabilistic aspects of autoimmune disorders.

angular resolution (< 2') will enable a wide range of time domain astrophysics.
For instance, transient sources such as gamma-ray bursts can be precisely
localized without assistance of secondary focusing X-ray telescopes to enable
rapid followup studies. On the other hand, high angular resolution in
coded-aperture imaging introduces a new challenge in handling the systematic
uncertainty: average photon count per pixel is often too small to establish a
proper background pattern or model the systematic uncertainty in a time scale
where the model remains invariant. We introduce two new techniques to improve
detection sensitivity, which are designed for, but not limited to high
resolution coded-aperture system: a self-background modeling scheme which
utilizes continuous scan or dithering operations, and a Poisson-statistics
based probabilistic approach to evaluate the significance of source detection
without subtraction in handling the background. We illustrate these new imaging
analysis techniques in high resolution coded-aperture telescope using the data
acquired by the wide-field hard X-ray telescope ProtoEXIST2 during the
high-altitude balloon flight in Fall, 2012. We review the imaging sensitivity
of ProtoEXIST2 during the flight, and demonstrate the performance of the new
techniques using our balloon flight data in comparison with simulated ideal
Poisson background.

magnetic shielding response which is measured using a low frequency two-coil
mutual inductance technique on a disordered superconducting NbN film having

At low amplitude the shielding response varies smoothly with excitation
amplitude, corresponding to elastic deformation of the vortex lattice. However,
above a threshold value of excitation the response shows a series of sharp

analysis reveals that this is a collective phenomenon which depends on the

system reduces to a regular, first-order symmetric hyperbolic system of

of singular elliptic constraints for the metric coefficients. We show how to
solve this system based on a numerical finite-difference approximation,
obtaining stable numerical evolutions for initial black hole configurations

disperses to infinity and part of which is accreted by the black hole. As a

one corresponding to a generator of null infinity. Our results are in perfect

the four-fold symmetric Fermi surface becomes unstable against a spontaneous
distortion into two-fold near the van Hove filling, where the symmetry of
superconductivity coexisting with the Pomeranchuk distorted Fermi surface is
modified from the d-wave pairing to (d+s)-wave. By systematically shifting the
position of van Hove filling with varied second- and third-neighbor hoppings,
we find that the transition temperature $T_{\rm c}^{\rm PI}$ of Pomeranchuk
instability is more sensitively affected by the position of van Hove filling
than the superconducting $T_{\rm c}^{\rm SC}$. This implies that the filling
region for strong Pomeranchuk instability and that for strong superconducting
fluctuations can be separated, and Pomeranchuk instability can appear even if
the peak of $T_c^{\rm PI}$ is lower than the peak of $T_c^{\rm SC}$. An
interesting observation is that the Fermi surface distortion can enhance the
superconducting $T_{\rm c}^{\rm SC}$ in the overdoped regime, which is
explained with a perturbation picture for small distortions.

clouds is still challenge. This paper investigates the energy-efficient
scheduling problems of virtual machines (VMs) onto physical machines (PMs) in
IaaS clouds along characteristics: multiple resources, fixed intervals and
non-preemption of virtual machines. The scheduling problems are NP-hard. Most
of existing works on VM placement reduce the total energy consumption by using
the minimum number of active physical machines. There, however, are cases using
the minimum number of physical machines results in longer the total busy time
of the physical machines. For the scheduling problems, minimizing the total
energy consumption of all physical machines is equivalent to minimizing total
busy time of all physical machines. In this paper, we propose an scheduling
algorithm, denoted as EMinTRE-LFT, for minimizing the total energy consumption
of physical machines in the scheduling problems. Our extensive simulations
using parallel workload models in Parallel Workload Archive show that the
proposed algorithm has the least total energy consumption compared to the
state-of-the art algorithms.

freedom. By using an atomistic model, we analyze the mechanism leading to the
valley filtering produced by a line-defect in graphene and show how it can be
inverted by external means. Thanks to a mode decomposition applied to a
tight-binding model we can resolve the different transport channels in k-space
while keeping a simple but accurate description of the band structure, both
close and further away from the Dirac point. This allows the understanding of a
destructive interference effect (Fano resonance or antiresonance) on the p-side
of the Dirac point leading to a reduced conductance. We show that in the
neighborhood of this feature the valley filtering can be reversed by changing
the occupations with a gate voltage, the mechanism is explained in terms of a
valley-dependent Fano resonance splitting. Our results open the door for an
enhanced control of valley transport in graphene-based devices.

often arises in semi-classically tractable supersymmetric theories, can
nevertheless be related to fluctuations about non-perturbative sectors via
resurgence. We also demonstrate that, in the same class of theories, the
vanishing of the ground state energy (unbroken supersymmetry) can be attributed
to the cancellation between a real saddle and a complex saddle (with hidden
topological angle pi), and positivity of the ground state energy (broken
supersymmetry) can be interpreted as the dominance of complex saddles. In
either case, despite the fact that the ground state energy is zero to all
orders in perturbation theory, all orders of fluctuations around
non-perturbative saddles are encoded in the perturbative E(N, g). We illustrate
these ideas with examples from supersymmetric quantum mechanics and quantum

model of anisotropic Fano resonance, which relates the spectral asymmetry to
two physically meaningful and experimentally accessible parameters of
interference, namely, the Fano phase shift and the relative amplitudes of the
interfering modes. The differences in these parameters between orthogonal
linear polarizations in an anisotropic system are exploited to desirably tune
the Fano spectral asymmetry using pre- and post-selection of optimized
polarization states. Experimental control on the Fano phase and the relative
amplitude parameters and resulting tuning of spectral asymmetry is demonstrated
in waveguided plasmonic crystals using Mueller matrix-based polarization
analysis. The approach enabled tailoring of several exotic regimes of Fano
resonance including the complete reversal of the spectral asymmetry. The
demonstrated control and the ensuing large tunability of Fano resonance in
anisotropic systems shows potential for Fano resonance-based applications

Methods based on Markov assumption are widely-used, but independently combine

methods have been successfully applied in several sequential modeling tasks.
However, for real-world applications, these methods have difficulty in modeling
the contextual information, which has been proved to be very important for
behavior modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel model, named Context-Aware
Recurrent Neural Networks (CA-RNN). Instead of using the constant input matrix
and transition matrix in conventional RNN models, CA-RNN employs adaptive
context-specific input matrices and adaptive context-specific transition
matrices. The adaptive context-specific input matrices capture external
situations where user behaviors happen, such as time, location, weather and so
on. And the adaptive context-specific transition matrices capture how lengths
of time intervals between adjacent behaviors in historical sequences affect the
transition of global sequential features. Experimental results show that the
proposed CA-RNN model yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art
sequential recommendation methods and context-aware recommendation methods on

group of G stars with high Li content $(\log A(Li) = 1.5 - 3)$, but being
slower rotators with rotation periods > 10 days, which are characterized by low
chromospheric activity. This agrees with a large spread in Li abundances in
superflare stars. A mechanism leading to this effect is discussed.

a single input RGB image. State-of-the-art approaches accomplish this in two
steps: firstly, regressing for every pixel in the image its 3D scene coordinate
and subsequently, using these coordinates to estimate the final 6D camera pose
via RANSAC. To solve the first step, Random Forests (RFs) are typically used.
On the other hand, Neural Networks (NNs) reign in many dense regression tasks,
but are not test-time efficient. We ask the question: which of the two is best
for camera localization? To address this, we make two method contributions: (1)
a test-time efficient NN architecture which we term a ForestNet that is derived
and initialized from a RF, and (2) a new fully-differentiable robust averaging
technique for regression ensembles which can be trained end-to-end with a NN.
Our experimental findings show that for scene coordinate regression,
traditional NN architectures are superior to test-time efficient RFs and
ForestNets, however, this does not translate to final 6D camera pose accuracy
where RFs and ForestNets perform slightly better. To summarize, our best
method, a ForestNet with a robust average, which has an equivalent fast and
lightweight RF, improves over the state-of-the-art for camera localization on
the 7-Scenes dataset. While this work focuses on scene coordinate regression
for camera localization, our innovations may also be applied to other
continuous regression tasks.

First, the CLQR problem is reformulated as a (finite-time) model predictive
control (MPC) problem without terminal constraints. Second, the MPC problem is
decomposed into smaller subproblems of fixed dimension independent of the
horizon length. Third, using the fast alternating minimization algorithm to
solve the subproblems, the horizon length is estimated online, by adding or
removing subproblems based on a periodic check on the state of the last
subproblem to determine whether it belongs to a given control invariant set. We
show that the estimated horizon length is bounded and that the control sequence
computed using the proposed algorithm is an optimal solution of the CLQR
problem. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms proposed to solve the CLQR
problem, our design solves at each iteration only unconstrained least-squares
problems and simple gradient calculations. Furthermore, our technique allows
the horizon length to decrease online (a useful feature if the initial guess on
the horizon is too conservative). Numerical results on a planar system show the
potential of our algorithm.

to flow across the gap from the outer disk onto the central star. We present
spatially unresolved HCO+ J=4-3 observations of the LkCa 15 disk from the JCMT

clearly detected, certifying the presence of gas in the cavity within <50 AU of

significant suppression of cavity dust (by a factor >10^4 compared to the ISM)
and a substantial increase in the gas scale-height within the cavity (H_0/R_0 ~
0.6). An ISM dust-to-gas ratio (d:g=10^-2) yields too little line-wing flux
regardless of the scale-height or cavity gas geometry, while a smaller
scale-height also under predicts the flux even with a reduced d:g. (3) The
cavity gas mass is consistent with the surface density profile of the outer

programming framework and discuss an approximate dynamic programming technique
for their solutions. As the cost-to-go functions are convex in these cases, we
use max-affine estimates for their approximations. To train such a max-affine
estimate, we provide a new convex regression algorithm, and evaluate it
empirically for these planning scenarios.

applications in such fields as quantum optics, trapped ultracold atoms, and
transport phenomena. Extension of this description to the case of fermionic
systems leads to formal Grassmann phase-space quasiprobability distributions
and master equations. The latter are usually considered as not possessing
probabillistic interpretation and as not directly computationally accessible.
Here, we describe how to construct $c$-number interpretations of Grassmann
phase space representations and their master equations. As a specific example,
the Grassmann $B$ representation is considered. We disscuss how to introduce
$c$-number probability distributions on Grassmann algebra and how to integrate
them. A measure of size and proximity is defined for Grassmann numbers, and the
Grassmann derivatives are introduced which are based on infinitesimal
variations of function arguments. An example of $c$-number interpretation of
formal Grassmann equations is presented.

computing an aggregate ranking of alternatives given individual rankings
provided by workers. Motivated by such systems, we consider a setting where
each worker is asked to rank a fixed (small) number of alternatives and, then,
a positional scoring rule is used to compute the aggregate ranking. Among the
apparently infinite such rules, what is the best one to use? To answer this
question, we assume that we have partial access to an underlying true ranking.
Then, the important optimization problem to be solved is to compute the
positional scoring rule whose outcome, when applied to the profile of
individual rankings, is as close as possible to the part of the underlying true
ranking we know. We study this fundamental problem from a theoretical viewpoint
and present positive and negative complexity results and, furthermore,
complement our theoretical findings with experiments on real-world and
synthetic data.

holographic superconductor and obtain transport properties like electrical and
thermal conductivities. We obtain transport properties in terms of the black
hole magnetic charge and interpret it as magnetic monopole of dual field
theory. We find that presence of magnetic charge is necessary to have maximum
conductivities, and existence of magnetic monopole with a critical charge (137
e) to reach the maximum superconductivity is important. Also, we show that
thermal conductivity increases with increasing of magnetic charge. It may be
concluded that the origin of superconductivity is magnetic monopole.

strained epitaxial semi-conductor film. These islands are commonly observed in
thin films undergoing a morphological instability due to the presence of the
elasto capillary effect. We first describe both analytically and numerically
the formation of an equilibrium island using a two dimensional continuous
model. We have found that these equilibrium island-like solutions have a
maximum height $h_0$ and they sit on top of a flat wetting layer with a
thickness $h_w$. We then consider two islands and we report that they undergo a
non-interrupted coarsening that follows a two stage dynamics. The first stage
may be depicted by a quasi-static dynamics, where the mass transfers are
proportional to the chemical potential difference of the islands. It is
associated with a time scale $t_c$ that is function of the distance $d$ between
the islands, and leads to the shrinkage of the smallest island. Once its height
becomes smaller than a minimal equilibrium height $h_{0}^{*}$, its mass spreads
over the entire system. Our results pave the way for a future analysis of
coarsening of an assembly of islands.

to support internal administration and marketing costs. The ratio of
administration to total costs, referred to as the administration ratio, is
highly variable and within any single fund depends on many factors including
the number and average size of projects and the overall efficiency of the
funding agency. In this study, the standard agency activities have been
identified and used to develop a model of administration costs against expected
outcomes. In particular, the model has been designed to estimate the optimum
portfolio success rate and administration ratio as a function of a range of key
input variables including the project size, the complexity of proposal
evaluation and project management, the risk tolerance of the sponsor and the
targeted research domain.
