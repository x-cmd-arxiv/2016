continuous map $\phi\colon X \to \mathbb{R}$. We provide an abstract criterion,
called \emph{control at any scale with a long sparse tail} for a point $x\in X$
and the map $\phi$, that guarantees that any weak$\ast$ limit measure $\mu$ of
the Birkhoff average of Dirac measures $\frac1n\sum_0^{n-1}\delta(f^i(x))$ is
such that $\mu$-almost every point $y$ has a dense orbit in $X$ and the
Birkhoff average of $\phi$ along the orbit of $y$ is zero.
  As an illustration of the strength of this criterion, we prove that the
diffeomorphisms with nonhyperbolic ergodic measures form a $C^1$-open and dense
subset of the set of robustly transitive partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms
with one dimensional nonhyperbolic central direction. We also obtain
applications for nonhyperbolic homoclinic classes.

the Pleiades, Hyades, M67 clusters, and the Ursa Major moving group. We further
test the calibration with extensive new Gemini/GMOS log$(R'_{\rm HK})$ data of
the old, solar $[$Fe/H$]$ clusters M67 and NGC 188. The observed NGC 188
activity level is clearly lower than M67. We correctly recover the isochronal

chromospheric ages for solar-type stars up to at least $\sim$6 Gyr, average
errors being $\sim$0.14 dex provided that the mass and $[$Fe/H$]$ dimensions

the presence of heavy rain and rain streak accumulation. Our core ideas lie in
the new rain image models and a novel deep learning architecture. We first
modify an existing model comprising a rain streak layer and a background layer,
by adding a binary map that locates rain streak regions. Second, we create a
new model consisting of a component representing rain streak accumulation
(where individual streaks cannot be seen, and thus visually similar to mist or
fog), and another component representing various shapes and directions of
overlapping rain streaks, which usually happen in heavy rain. Based on the
first model, we develop a multi-task deep learning architecture that learns the
binary rain streak map, the appearance of rain streaks, and the clean
background, which is our ultimate output. The additional binary map is
critically beneficial, since its loss function can provide additional strong
information to the network. To handle rain streak accumulation (again, a
phenomenon visually similar to mist or fog) and various shapes and directions
of overlapping rain streaks, we propose a recurrent rain detection and removal
network that removes rain streaks and clears up the rain accumulation
iteratively and progressively. In each recurrence of our method, a new
contextualized dilated network is developed to exploit regional contextual
information and outputs better representation for rain detection. The
evaluation on real images, particularly on heavy rain, shows the effectiveness
of our novel models and architecture, outperforming the state-of-the-art

meta-problem, called $\mathcal{F}$-Immersion Deletion: given a graph $G$ and
integer $k$, decide whether the deletion of at most $k$ edges of $G$ can result
in a graph that does not contain any graph from $\mathcal{F}$ as an immersion.
This problem is a close relative of the $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Deletion problem
studied by Fomin et al. [FOCS 2012], where one deletes vertices in order to
remove all minor models of graphs from $\mathcal{F}$.
  We prove that whenever all graphs from $\mathcal{F}$ are connected and at
least one graph of $\mathcal{F}$ is planar and subcubic, then the
$\mathcal{F}$-Immersion Deletion problem admits: a constant-factor
approximation algorithm running in time $O(m^3 \cdot n^3 \cdot \log m)$; a
linear kernel that can be computed in time $O(m^4 \cdot n^3 \cdot \log m)$; and
a $O(2^{O(k)} + m^4 \cdot n^3 \cdot \log m)$-time fixed-parameter algorithm,
where $n,m$ count the vertices and edges of the input graph.
  These results mirror the findings of Fomin et al. [FOCS 2012], who obtained a
similar set of algorithmic results for $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Deletion, under the
assumption that at least one graph from $\mathcal{F}$ is planar. An important
difference is that we are able to obtain a linear kernel for
$\mathcal{F}$-Immersion Deletion, while the exponent of the kernel of Fomin et
al. for $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Deletion depends heavily on the family
$\mathcal{F}$. In fact, this dependence is unavoidable under plausible
complexity assumptions, as proven by Giannopoulou et al. [ICALP 2015]. This
reveals that the kernelization complexity of $\mathcal{F}$-Immersion Deletion
is quite different than that of $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Deletion.

only single cycles rather than the standard paired cycles, the generalized
$\mathbf{R}$ redundancy technique has been shown to almost halve the necessary
light-trail resources in the network. Our greedy heuristic improves this
cycle-based routing technique's fault-tolerance and dependability.
  For efficiency and distributed control, it is common in distributed systems
and algorithms to group nodes into intersecting sets referred to as quorum
sets. Optimal communication quorum sets forming optical cycles based on
light-trails have been shown to flexibly and efficiently route both
point-to-point and multipoint-to-multipoint traffic requests. Commonly cycle
routing techniques will use pairs of cycles to achieve both routing and
fault-tolerance, which uses substantial resources and creates the potential for
underutilization. Instead, we use a single cycle and intentionally utilize
$\mathbf{R}$ redundancy within the quorum cycles such that every point-to-point
communication pairs occur in at least $\mathbf{R}$ cycles. Without the paired
cycles the direction of the quorum cycles becomes critical to the fault
tolerance performance. For this we developed a greedy cycle direction heuristic
and our single fault network simulations show a reduction of missing pairs by
greater than 30%, which translates to significant improvements in fault
coverage.

can be described by the identification of domains that can be activated

chemical reactions to network substructures and the identification of critical
sites whose activation results in complete activation of the system. Although
the experiments were performed with a specific nickel electrodissolution

estimating the reference spectral signatures contained in a hyperspectral
image, as well as their relative contribution to each pixel according to a
given mixture model. In practice, the process is further complexified by the
inherent spectral variability of the observed scene and the possible presence
of outliers. More specifically, multi-temporal hyperspectral images, i.e.,
sequences of hyperspectral images acquired over the same area at different time
instants, are likely to simultaneously exhibit moderate endmember variability
and abrupt spectral changes either due to outliers or to significant time
intervals between consecutive acquisitions. Unless properly accounted for,
these two perturbations can significantly affect the unmixing process. In this
context, we propose a new unmixing model for multitemporal hyperspectral images
accounting for smooth temporal variations, construed as spectral variability,
and abrupt spectral changes interpreted as outliers. The proposed hierarchical
Bayesian model is inferred using a Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) method
allowing the posterior of interest to be sampled and Bayesian estimators to be
approximated. A comparison with unmixing techniques from the literature on
synthetic and real data allows the interest of the proposed approach to be

  characters limitation",,,,"math-ph gr-qc hep-th math.MP math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work focuses on non-compact groups and their applications to quantum
gravity, mainly through the use of tensor operators. First, the mathematical
theory of tensor operators for a Lie group is recast in a new way which is used
to generalise the Wigner-Eckart theorem to non-compact groups. The result
relies on the knowledge of the recoupling theory between finite-dimensional and
infinite-dimensional irreducible representations of the group; here the
previously unconsidered cases of the 3D and 4D Lorentz groups are investigated
in detail. As an application, the Wigner-Eckart theorem is used to generalise
the Jordan-Schwinger representation of SU(2) to both groups, for all
representation classes. Next, the results obtained for the 3D Lorentz group are
applied to (2+1) Lorentzian loop quantum gravity to develop an analogue of the
well-known spinorial approach used in the Euclidean case. Tensor operators are
used to construct observables and to generalise the Hamiltonian constraint
introduced by Bonzom and Livine (2012) for 3D gravity to the Lorentzian case.
The Ponzano-Regge amplitude is shown to be a solution of this constraint by
recovering the (opportunely generalised) Biedenharn-Elliott relations. Finally,
the focus is shifted on the intertwiner space based on SU(2) representations,
widely used in loop quantum gravity. When working in the spinorial formalism,
it has been shown that the Hilbert space of n-valent intertwiners with fixed
total area is a representation of U(n). Here it is shown that the full space of
all n-valent intertwiners forms an irreducible representation of the
non-compact group SO*(2n). This fact is used to construct a new kind of
coherent intertwiner state (in the sense of Perelomov). Hints of how these
coherent states can be interpreted in the semi-classical limit as convex
polyhedra are provided.

  Analysis of Self-Healing Interdependent Networks","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1606.00955",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coupling cyber and physical systems gives rise to numerous engineering
challenges and opportunities. An important challenge is the contagion of
failure from one system to another, which can lead to large-scale cascading
failures. However, the self-healing ability emerges as a valuable opportunity
where the overlaying cyber network can cure failures in the underlying physical
network. To capture both self-healing and contagion, this paper considers a
graphical model representation of an interdependent cyber-physical system, in
which nodes represent various cyber or physical functionalities, and edges
capture the interactions between the nodes. A message-passing algorithm is
proposed for this representation to study the dynamics of failure propagation
and healing. By conducting a density evolution analysis for this algorithm,
network reaction to initial disruptions is investigated. It is proved that as
the number of message-passing iterations increases, the network reaches a
steady-state condition that would be either a complete healing or a complete
collapse. Then, a sufficient condition is derived to select the network
parameters to guarantee the complete healing of the system. The result of the
density evolution analysis is further employed to jointly optimize the design
of cyber and physical networks for maximum resiliency. This analytical
framework is then extended to the cases where propagation of failures in the
physical network is faster than the healing responses of the cyber network.
Such scenarios are of interest in many real-life applications such as smart
grid. Finally, extensive numerical results are presented to verify the analysis
and investigate the impact of the network parameters on the resiliency of the
network.

We define the weakly movable cone as the cone generated by the pushforward of
cycle classes of nef subvarieties via proper surjective maps. This cone
contains the movable cone and shares similar intersection-theoretic properties
with it, thanks to the aforementioned properties of nef subvarieties. On the
other hand, we prove that if $Y\subset X$ is an ample subscheme of codimension
$r$ and $D|_Y$ is $q$-ample, then $D$ is $(q+r)$-ample. This is analogous to a

associated grazing plus mortality. Vertical transport is diffusive but responds
to pore structure. Simulated bottom layer chlorophyll maxima are reasonable,
though delayed by about a month relative to observations. This highlights major
uncertainties deriving from snow thickness variability. Upper level biota are
generated intermittently through flooding. Macromolecular injections are
represented by the compound classes humics, proteins, polysaccharides and

therefore appended, and agreement with dissolved organic or individual

the ejected colloidal droplets from nozzles of diameters of O(1 {\mu}m) can
controllably reach sizes an order of magnitude smaller than the nozzle and can
generate planar and out-of-plane structures of similar sizes. Despite
demonstrated capabilities, our fundamental understanding of important aspects

the topics of charge content and transport in NanoDrip printing. We employ
quantum dot and gold nanoparticle dispersions in combination with a specially

show that the ligand length of the nanoparticles in the colloid affects their

we propose a novel caching scheme, which strictly improves the state of the art

set of all demands into types, and showing that the placement phase in the
proposed caching scheme is universally optimal for all types. Using these

V-[Fe/H] relation for a strictly selected sample with high enough astrometric
accuracy. We aim to arrive at an explanation for the slopes of the V-[Fe/H]
relationship. We measure the V-[Fe/H] relation for thin and thick disk stars
classified on the basis of their [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H] abundances. We find
dV/d[Fe/H]= -18 +/- 2 km/s/dex for stars in the thin disk and dV/d[Fe/H]= +23
+/- 10 km/s/dex for thick disk stars, so we confirm the different signs for the
slopes. The negative value of dV/d[Fe/H] for thick disk stars is consistent
with previous studies, but the combination of TGAS and APOGEE data provide
higher precision, even though systematic errors could exceed +/-5 km/s/dex .
Our average measurement of dV/d[Fe/H] for local thick disk stars shows a
somewhat flatter slope than the previous studies, but we confirm a significant
spread and a dependence of the slope on the [alpha/Fe] ratio of the stars.
Using a simple N-body model, we demonstrate that the observed trend for the

gradients and the correlation between orbital eccentricity and metallicity in
the thick disk.

thin slab of Weyl semimetal with chiral surface states along its edge. It is
shown that weak disorder does not disrupt chiral edge states but crucially
affects them owing to the renormalization of a mass parameter: the number of
chiral edge states changes depending on the strength of disorder. It is also
shown that the Hall conductance is quantized when the Fermi level is located
near Weyl nodes within a finite-size gap. This quantization of the Hall
conductance collapses once the strength of disorder exceeds a critical value,
suggesting that it serves as a probe to distinguish a Weyl semimetal phase from

located towards the Galactic bulge, calibrated on the 2MASS photometric system.
Differential reddening corrections and statistical field star decontamination
are employed for all of these clusters before fitting fiducial sequences to the
cluster red giant branches (RGBs). Observed values and uncertainties are
reported for several photometric features, including the magnitude of the RGB
bump, tip, the horizontal branch (HB) and the slope of the upper RGB. The
latest spectroscopically determined chemical abundances are used to build
distance- and reddening-independent relations between observed photometric
features and cluster metallicity, optimizing the sample size and metallicity
baseline of these relations by supplementing our sample with results from the
literature. We find that the magnitude different between the HB and the RGB
bump can be used to predict metallicities, in terms of both iron abundance
[Fe/H] and global metallicity [M/H], with a precision of better than 0.1 dex in
all three near-IR bandpasses for relative metal-rich ([M/H]$\gtrsim$-1)
clusters. Meanwhile, both the slope of the upper RGB and the magnitude
difference between the RGB tip and bump are useful metallicity indicators over
the entire sampled metallicity range (-2$\lesssim$[M/H]$\lesssim$0) with a
precision of 0.2 dex or better, despite model predictions that the RGB slope
may become unreliable at high (near-solar) metallicities. Our results agree
with previous calibrations in light of the relevant uncertainties, and we
discuss implications for clusters with controversial metallicities as well as
directions for further investigation.

  under Dynamic Loadings","43 pages, 12 figures. Recieved by International Journal of Plasticity",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Phase transition of iron, as a prototype of martensite phase transition under
dynamic loadings, exhibits huge diverges in its TP among experiments with
different pressure medium and loading rates, even in the same initial samples.
Great achievements are made in understanding strain or stress dependence of the
TP under dynamic loadings. However, present understandings on the strain rate
dependence of the TP are far from clear, even a virgin for extreme high strain
rates. In this work, large scale NEMD simulations are conducted to study the
effects of strain rates on the phase transition of iron-based single crystals.
Our results show that the phase transition is preceded by lattice instabilities
under ramp compressions, but present theory, represented by modified Born
criteria, cannot correctly predict observed onsets of the instability. Through
considering both strain and strain gradient disturbances, new instability
criteria are proposed, which could be generally applied for studying
instabilities under either static or dynamic loadings. For the ramp with a
strain rate smaller than about 1010s-1, the observed onset of instabilities is
indeed equal to the one predicted by the new instability criteria under small
gradient disturbances. The observed onsets deviates from the predicted one at
lager strain rates because of finite strain gradient effect. Interestingly, the
strain rate dependence of the TP also exhibits an obvious change at the same
strain rate, i.e., 1010 s-1. When 1010 s-1, a certain power law is obeyed, but
it is not applicable at larger strain rates. This strain rate effect on the TP
is well interpreted with nucleation time and the finite strain gradient effect.
According to these basic understandings, the roles of strain rates on
nucleation and growth of the phase transition are studied.

network nodes are highly appealing for lots of important data communication
services. Ensuring the security of such networks is of great importance to
facilitate their applications in supporting future social-based services with
strong security guarantee. This paper explores the physical layer
security-based secure communication in a finite Poisson network with social
friendships among nodes, for which a social friendship-based cooperative
jamming scheme is proposed. The jamming scheme consists of a Local Friendship
Circle (LFC) and a Long-range Friendship Annulus (LFA), where all legitimate
nodes in the LFC serve as jammers, but the legitimate nodes in the LFA are
selected as jammers through three location-based policies. To understand both
the security and reliability performance of the proposed jamming scheme, we
first model the sum interference at any location in the network by deriving its
Laplace transform under two typical path loss scenarios. With the help of the
interference Laplace transform results, we then derive the exact expression for
the transmission outage probability (TOP) and determine both the upper and
lower bounds on the secrecy outage probability (SOP), such that the overall
outage performances of the proposed jamming scheme can be depicted. Finally, we
present extensive numerical results to validate the theoretical analysis of TOP
and SOP and also to illustrate the impacts of the friendship-based cooperative
jamming on the network performances.

reported, which confirms the magnetoelectric coupling in Bi5Ti3FeO15, indicates
the electric and magnetic orders are coupled through ferroelasticity. Due to
the anisotropic relaxation of ferroelastic strain, the back-switching of
out-of-plane electric domains is not as obvious as in-plane. An inevitable
destabilization of the coupling between elastic and magnetic ordering happens
because of the elastic strain relaxation, which result in a subsequent decay of

interface on the velocity and direction of motion of the droplet along the
centerline of imposed Poiseuille flow is investigated in the presence of
linearly varying temperature field. In the absence of thermal convection, fluid
inertia and shape deformation, the interfacial transport of bulk-insoluble
surfactants is governed by the surface Peclet number which represents the
relative strength of the advective transport of surfactant over the diffusive
transport. We obtain analytical solution for small and large values of the
surface Peclet number. Numerical solution is obtained for arbitrary surface
Peclet number, which compares well with the analytical solution. Depending on
the direction of temperature gradient with respect to the imposed Poiseuille
flow, the surfactant-induced Marangoni stress affects the droplet velocity
differently. When the imposed temperature increases in the direction of imposed
Poiseuille flow, surfactants retard the droplet motion as compared with a
surfactant-free droplet. However, when the imposed temperature decreases in the
direction of imposed Poiseuille flow, presence of surfactants may increase or
decrease the magnitude of droplet velocity depending on the relevant governing
parameters. Further, for particular values of governing parameters, we observe
change in direction of droplet motion due to presence of surfactants, which may
bear significant consequences in the design of droplet based microfluidic

  summaries in linear time","24 pages, 6 figures",,,,"stat.CO stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stochastic mapping is a simulation-based method for probabilistically mapping
substitution histories onto phylogenies according to continuous-time Markov
models of evolution. This technique can be used to infer properties of the
evolutionary process on the phylogeny and, unlike parsimony-based mapping,
conditions on the observed data to randomly draw substitution mappings that do
not necessarily require the minimum number of events on a tree. Most stochastic
mapping applications simulate substitution mappings only to estimate the mean
and/or variance of two commonly used mapping summaries: the number of
particular types of substitutions (labeled substitution counts) and the time
spent in a particular group of states (labeled dwelling times) on the tree.
Fast, simulation-free algorithms for calculating the mean of stochastic mapping
summaries exist. Importantly, these algorithms scale linearly in the number of
tips/leaves of the phylogenetic tree. However, to our knowledge, no such
algorithm exists for calculating higher-order moments of stochastic mapping
summaries. We present one such simulation-free dynamic programming algorithm
that calculates prior and posterior mapping variances and scales linearly in
the number of phylogeny tips. Our procedure suggests a general framework that
can be used to efficiently compute higher-order moments of stochastic mapping
summaries without simulations. We demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm
by extending previously developed statistical tests for rate variation across
sites and for detecting evolutionarily conserved regions in genomic sequences.

challenging, particularly in non-communicating scenarios where each agent's
intent (e.g. goal) is unobservable to the others. In particular, finding time
efficient paths often requires anticipating interaction with neighboring
agents, the process of which can be computationally prohibitive. This work
presents a decentralized multiagent collision avoidance algorithm based on a
novel application of deep reinforcement learning, which effectively offloads
the online computation (for predicting interaction patterns) to an offline
learning procedure. Specifically, the proposed approach develops a value
network that encodes the estimated time to the goal given an agent's joint
configuration (positions and velocities) with its neighbors. Use of the value
network not only admits efficient (i.e., real-time implementable) queries for
finding a collision-free velocity vector, but also considers the uncertainty in
the other agents' motion. Simulation results show more than 26 percent
improvement in paths quality (i.e., time to reach the goal) when compared with
optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA), a state-of-the-art collision
avoidance strategy.

micro-cracking and faulting. However, it has often been found that continuum
fluid models, usually based on a non-Newtonian viscosity, are applicable. To
explain this rheology, we use a fiber-bundle model, which is a model of damage
mechanics. In our analyses, yield stress was introduced. Above this stress, we
hypothesize that the fibers begin to fail and a failed fiber is replaced by a
new fiber. This replacement is analogous to a micro-crack or an earthquake and
its iteration is analogous to stick-slip motion. Below the yield stress, we
assume that no fiber failure occurs, and the material behaves elastically. We
show that deformation above yield stress under a constant strain rate for a
sufficient amount of time can be modeled as an equation similar to that used
for non-Newtonian viscous flow. We expand our rheological model to treat
viscoelasticity and consider a stress relaxation problem. The solution can be
used to understand aftershock temporal decay following an earthquake. Our
results provide justification for the use of a non-Newtonian viscous flow to
model the continuum deformation of brittle materials.

a two dimensional square lattice landscape. We explicitly consider the self
volume of the prey restraining their dynamics on the lattice. The movement of
both predator and prey is chosen to include an intelligent, decision making
step based on their respective sighting ranges, the radius in which they can
detect the other species (prey cannot recognise each other besides the self
volume interaction): after spotting each other the motion of prey and predator
turns from a nearest neighbour random walk into direct escape or chase,
respectively. We consider a large range of prey densities and sighting ranges
and compute the mean first passage time for a predator to catch a prey as well
as characterise the effective dynamics of the hunted prey. We find that the
prey's sighting range dominates their life expectancy and the predator profits
more from a bad eyesight of the prey than from his own good eye sight. We
characterise the dynamics in terms of the mean distance between the predator
and the nearest prey. It turns out that effectively the dynamics of this
distance coordinate can be captured in terms of a simple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
picture. Reducing the many-body problem to a simple two-body problem by
imagining predator and nearest prey to be connected by a Hookean bond, all

common and significant. For example, the research on the supercoiling of DNA is
helpful for understanding the replication and transcription of DNA. Similar
double helices can appear in polymer chains, carbon nanotube yarns, cables,
telephone wires and so forth. We noticed that non-uniform double helices can be
produced due to the surface friction induced by the self-contact. Therefore an
ideal model was presented to investigate the formation of double helices for
elastic rods under torque. A general equilibrium condition which is valid for
both the smooth surface and the rough surface situations is derived by using
the variational method. Based on this, by adding further constraints, the
smooth and rough surface situations are investigated in detail respectively.
Additionally, the model showed that the specific process of how to twist and
slack the rod can determine the surface friction and hence influence the
configuration of the double helix formed by rods with rough surfaces. Based on
this principle, a method of manufacturing double helices with designed
configurations was proposed and demonstrated. Finally, experiments were
performed to verify the model and the results agreed well with the theory.

semidiscretizations of partial differential equations---are often required to
have certain monotonicity or boundedness properties (e.g.
strong-stability-preserving, total-variation-diminishing or
total-variation-boundedness properties). These properties can be guaranteed by
imposing step-size restrictions on the methods. To qualitatively describe the
step-size restrictions, one introduces the concept of step-size coefficient for
monotonicity (SCM, also referred to as the strong-stability-preserving (SSP)
coefficient) or its generalization, the step-size coefficient for boundedness
(SCB). A LMM with larger SCM or SCB is more efficient, and the computation of
the maximum SCM for a particular LMM is now straightforward. However, it is
more challenging to decide whether a positive SCB exists, or determine if a
given positive number is a SCB. Theorems involving sign conditions on certain
linear recursions associated to the LMM have been proposed in the literature
that allow us to answer the above questions: the difficulty with these theorems
is that there are in general infinitely many sign conditions to be verified. In
this work we present methods to rigorously check the sign conditions. As an
illustration, we confirm some recent numerical investigations concerning the
existence of SCBs in the BDF and in the extrapolated BDF (EBDF) families. As a

strategy motivates the need to investigate whether IA can be leveraged to aid
conventional network optimization algorithms that are only capable of finding
locally optimal solutions. To test the usefulness of IA in this context, this
paper proposes a two-stage optimization framework for the downlink of a
$G$-cell multi-antenna network with $K$ users/cell. The first stage of the
proposed framework focuses on nulling interference from a set of dominant
interferers using IA, while the second stage optimizes transmit and receive
beamformers to maximize a network-wide utility using the IA solution as the
initial condition. Further, this paper establishes a set of new feasibility
results for partial IA that can be used to guide the number of dominant
interferers to be nulled in the first stage. Through simulations on specific
topologies of a cluster of base-stations, it is observed that the impact of IA
depends on the choice of the utility function and the presence of
out-of-cluster interference. In the absence of out-of-cluster interference, the
proposed framework outperforms straightforward optimization when maximizing the
minimum rate, while providing marginal gains when maximizing sum-rate. However,
the benefit of IA is greatly diminished in the presence of significant
out-of-cluster interference.

quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). The evolution of QPO frequency is explained
by the systematic variation of the Compton cloud size, i.e., the steady radial
movement of the shock front, which is triggered by the cooling of the
post-shock region. Thus, analysis of energy-dependent temporal properties in
different variability time scales can diagnose the dynamics and geometry of
accretion flows around black holes. We study these properties for the high
inclination black hole source XTE J1550-564 during its 1998 outburst and the
low-inclination black hole source GX 339-4 during its 2006-07 outburst using
RXTE/PCA data, and we find that they can satisfactorily explain the time lags
associated with the QPOs from these systems. We find a smooth decrease of the
time lag as a function of time in the rising phase of both sources. In the
declining phase the time lag increases with time. We find a systematic
evolution of QPO frequency and hard lags in these outbursts. In XTE J1550-564,
the lag changes from hard to soft (i.e., from a positive to a negative value)
at a crossing frequency ($\nu_C$) of $\sim 3.4$ Hz. We present possible

corrected the wavelength solution and removed telluric absorption with
Molecfit, then resampled the spectra to a common wavelength scale, shifted them

of human crowd movement is important. However, precise interactions among
pedestrians are difficult to measure in the presence of their complex
decision-making processes and many related factors. While extensive studies on
pedestrian flow through bottlenecks and corridors have been conducted, the
dominant mode of interaction in these scenarios may not be relevant in
different scenarios. Here, we attempt to decipher the factors that affect human
reactions to other individuals from a different perspective. We conducted
experiments employing the inflow process in which pedestrians successively
enter a confined area (like an elevator) and look for a temporary position. In
this process, pedestrians have a wider range of options regarding their motion
than in the classical scenarios; therefore, other factors might become
relevant. The preference of location is visualized by pedestrian density
profiles obtained from recorded pedestrian trajectories. Non-trivial patterns
of space acquisition, e.g., an apparent preference for positions near corners,
were observed. This indicates the relevance of psychological and anticipative
factors beyond the private sphere, which have not been deeply discussed so far
in the literature on pedestrian dynamics. From the results, four major factors,
which we call flow avoidance, distance cost, angle cost, and boundary
preference, were suggested. We confirmed that a description of decision-making
based on these factors can give a rise to realistic preference patterns, using
a simple mathematical model. Our findings provide new perspectives and a
baseline for considering the optimization of design and safety in crowded
public areas and public transport carriers.

Coanda actuator. The analysis is based on flow field data obtained from 2D
unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations with different
actuation conditions. The optimal sensor locations is compared against the
current de-facto standard of maximum POD modal amplitude location, and against
a brute force approach that scans all possible sensor combinations. The results
show that both the flow conditions and the type of sensor have an effect on the
optimal sensor placement, whereas the choice of the response function appears
to have limited influence.

gamma-ray emission with shell-like morphology. To constrain the hydrodynamical
evolution, we have performed six times observations of the northwestern (NW)
shell with the Chandra X-ray Observatory from 2005 to 2011, and measured the
proper motion by using these data and the first epoch observation taken in
2000. The blast-wave shock speed at the NW shell is measured to be $(3900\pm
300) (d/{\rm kpc})\ {\rm km}\ {\rm s}^{-1}$ with an estimated distance of $d =
1$ kpc, and the proper motions of other structures within the NW shell are
significantly less than that. Assuming that the measured blast-wave shock speed
is the representative of the remnant's outer shock wave as a whole, we have
confronted our measurements as well as a recent detection of thermal X-ray
lines, with the analytic solution of the hydrodynamical properties of SNRs. Our
hydrodynamical analysis indicates that the age of the remnant is 1580-2100
years, supporting the association with SN393. A model with SN kinetic energy of
$E = 10^{51}\, \rm erg$, the ejecta mass of $M_{\rm ej} = 3\, M_{\odot}$, and
the ambient density at the current blast wave location of $n_2 = 0.015\, {\rm
cm}^{-3}$, provides reasonable explanation for our measurements and previous
findings at the X-ray and gamma-ray wavelengths. We find that the transition to
the Sedov-Taylor (ST) phase is incomplete for any reasonable set of parameters,
implying that the current maximum energy of accelerated protons in RX
J1713.7-3946 would not correspond to the maximum attainable energy for this
remnant.

(2D) channel of quiescent medium are studied. The tracer drives the system out
of equilibrium, perturbs the density and pressure fields, and gives the bath
particles a nonzero average velocity, creating a current in the channel. Three
models in which the confining effect of the channel is probed are analyzed and
compared in this study: the first is the simple symmetric exclusion process
(SSEP), for which the stationary density profile and the pressure on the walls
in the frame of the tracer are computed. We show that the tracer acts like a
dipolar source in an average velocity field. The spatial structure of this 2D
strip is then simplified to a one dimensional SSEP, in which exchanges of
position between the tracer and the bath particles are allowed. Using a
combination of mean field theory and exact solution in the limit where no
exchange is allowed, gives good predictions of the velocity of the tracer and
the density field. Finally, we show that results obtained for the 1D SSEP with
exchanges also apply to a gas of overdamped hard disks in a narrow channel. The
correspondence between the parameters of the SSEP and of the gas of hard disks

of the cell volume. There is still no general agreement on the mechanism
leading to the compaction of the DNA and the formation of the nucleoid.
However, advances in in vivo sub-wavelength resolution microscopy techniques
have recently allowed the observation of the nucleoid at an unprecedented level
of detail. In particular, these observations show that the compaction of the
nucleoid is not static but is instead a highly dynamic feature, which depends
on several factors, like the richness of the nutrient, the cell cycle stage,
temperature, the action of an osmotic shock or antibiotics, etc. After a short
description of the electrolyte content of the cytosol and a brief overview of
the different mechanisms that may lead to the formation of the nucleoid, this
paper reviews some of the most fascinating recent results of in vivo
sub-wavelength resolution microscopy. It is furthermore argued that these
observations provide converging indications in favor of a model that describes
the cytosol as an aqueous electrolyte solution containing several
macromolecular species, where demixing and segregative phase separation occur
between DNA and RNA (essentially rRNA and mRNA involved in translation
complexes, but also the large amounts of rRNA synthesized at the rrn operons of
cells growing in rich media). It is also pointed out that crowding may play a
crucial role through its synergy with electrostatic forces. By constraining
macromolecules to remain at short distances from one another and feel
electrostatic interactions in spite of the strong screening exerted by
electrolyte species, crowding favors stronger DNA/RNA demixing and nucleoid
compaction.

barriers is a fundamental aspect in the context of electronic engineering of
nanostructured thermoelectrics. In the context of thermoelectric generators, it
aims to engineer the Seebeck coefficient to favorably increase the power factor
and ultimately the power generated. In this work, we employ the incoherent
non-equilibrium Green's function formalism to investigate in detail the physics
of energy filtering and how it leads to a direct enhancement in power
generation across nanostructured thermoelectrics featuring a single planar
energy barrier. In particular, we reinforce that the enhancement in the
generated power via energy filtering at a particular operating efficiency is a
characteristic of incoherent scattering and is absent in ballistic devices. In
such cases, by assuming an energy dependent relaxation time, $\tau(E)=kE^r$, we
show that there exists a minimum value $r_{min}$ for which the thermoelectric
power generation is enhanced and thereby leading to a degradation in power
generation for $r<r_{min}$. For bulk generators, we delve into the details of
intermode scattering and show that such scattering processes between electrons
in higher energy modes and lower energy modes have a finite contribution to the
enhancement in the generated power. We also discuss realistic aspects such as
finite width of energy barriers and imperfect energy filtering due to partial
reflections. In particular, we show that such imperfect filtering and partial
transmission of electrons near the top of the barrier affects the enhancement
in the generated power drastically in the high efficiency regime of operation.
Analysis of the results obtained in this work should provide general design
guidelines for nanostructured enhancement in power generation via energy
filtering.

In order to overcome this shortcoming, this paper presents an alternative

associated with the second stage is solved by a novel coordinate descent
method. As a major salient feature, the proposed approach does not rely on the
transformation of the second-stage problem to a single-level equivalent. As a
consequence, bilinear terms involving dual variables or Lagrange multipliers do
not arise, thereby precluding the use of computationally expensive big-M-based
linearization schemes. Thus, not only is the computational effort reduced, but
also the typically overlooked non-trivial tuning of bounding parameters for
dual variables or Lagrange multipliers is avoided. The practical applicability
of the proposed methodology is confirmed by numerical testing on several
benchmarks including a case based on the Polish 2383-bus system, which is well
beyond the capability of the robust methods available in the literature.

any possible choice of spin structure on the spatial sections, if we impose two
conditions. The first one is that the symmetries of the classical system must
be implemented quantum mechanically, so that the vacuum is invariant under the
symmetry transformations. The second and more important condition is that the
constructed theory must have a quantum dynamics that is implementable as a
(non-trivial) unitary operator in Fock space. Actually, this unitarity of the
quantum dynamics leads us to identify as explicitly time dependent some very
specific contributions of the Dirac field. In doing that, we essentially
characterize the part of the dynamics governed by the Dirac equation that is

insulating EuTiO3 (ETO) deposited on a thin SrTiO3 (STO) substrate with both
being non-magnetic materials are demonstrated to be a versatile tool for light
modulation. The operating temperature is close to room temperature and admits
multiple device engineering. By using small magnetic fields birefringence of
the samples can be switched off and on. Similarly, rotation of the sample in
the field can modify its birefringence {\Delta}n. In addition, {\Delta}n can be
increased by a factor of 4 in very modest fields with simultaneously enhancing
the operating temperature by almost 100K.

the traditional top-down learning structure usually applied at university, in
which practical sessions are often a mere verification of the laws taught

on experiments made by the students. Interaction among students and self
questioning are strongly encouraged and practicing comes first, before any
theoretical knowledge. Through a series of concrete examples, the present paper
describes the philosophy underlying the teaching in this course. We demonstrate
that not only geometrical optics can be taught through experiments, but also
that it can serve as a useful introduction to experimental physics. Feedback
over the last ten years shows that our approach succeeds in helping students to
learn better and acquire motivation and autonomy. This approach can easily be
applied to other fields of physics.

conceptual framework for safety risk analysis, we propose a novel methodology
to compute construction univariate and bivariate construction safety risk at a
situational level. Our fully data-driven approach provides construction
practitioners and academicians with an easy and automated way of extracting
valuable empirical insights from databases of unstructured textual injury
reports. By applying our methodology on an attribute and outcome dataset
directly obtained from 814 injury reports, we show that the frequency-magnitude
distribution of construction safety risk is very similar to that of natural
phenomena such as precipitation or earthquakes. Motivated by this observation,
and drawing on state-of-the-art techniques in hydroclimatology and insurance,
we introduce univariate and bivariate nonparametric stochastic safety risk
generators, based on Kernel Density Estimators and Copulas. These generators
enable the user to produce large numbers of synthetic safety risk values
faithfully to the original data, allowing safetyrelated decision-making under
uncertainty to be grounded on extensive empirical evidence. Just like the
accurate modeling and simulation of natural phenomena such as wind or
streamflow is indispensable to successful structure dimensioning or water
reservoir management, we posit that improving construction safety calls for the
accurate modeling, simulation, and assessment of safety risk. The underlying
assumption is that like natural phenomena, construction safety may benefit from
being studied in an empirical and quantitative way rather than qualitatively
which is the current industry standard. Finally, a side but interesting finding
is that attributes related to high energy levels and to human error emerge as
strong risk shapers on the dataset we used to illustrate our methodology.

cycle, $\mathit\Pi=67.6(5)$ yr, can be well reproduced by the models, which
predict a cycle length of 51 yr. However, for HD 37776, the observed lower

application of the proposed algorithm, we prove that the coclique number of a

diffeomorphisms is $C^1$closed inside the group of all volume-preserving
diffeomorphisms isotopic to the identity map:This recovers several results from
symplectic geometry. The fix-points theory does not resist to the above
machinery: We prove a general contractibility result with respect to the orbits
of the fix-points for volume-preserving diffeomorphisms isotopic to the
identity map via vanishing-flux paths, generalize and solve the Arnold
conjecture using the Thurston fragmentation property. In the sequel, we use
fix-points to: Characterize the flux geometry of certain $C^0$limits of
sequences of vanishing-flux paths and volumepreserving diffeomorphisms. Beside
this, a $C^0$criterion for the existence of at least one fix-point is given,
and a weak version of the generalized $C^0$flux conjecture is solved. Finally,
we construct a pseudo right-invariant metric on the group of all
volume-preserving diffeomorphisms isotopic to the identity map, prove several
comparison results suitable to the study of the Hofer-like geometry of the
group $Ham(N; w)$, of all Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic
manifold $(N; w)$, derive the equivalence between the Hofer and the Hofer-like
metrics on $Ham(N; w)$, and exhibit a computational proof of the non-degeneracy
of the Hofer-like energies: Here, an outcome is that the Calabi group controls
the Hofer-like geometry of the group $Ham(N; w)$ of any closed symplectic
manifold $(N; w)$.

profile in galaxy images are a common way to estimate gravitational shear. We
employ general adaptive moments (GLAM) to study causes of shear bias on a
fundamental level and for a practical definition of an image ellipticity. The
GLAM ellipticity has useful properties for any chosen weight profile: the
weighted ellipticity is identical to that of isophotes of elliptical images,
and in absence of noise and pixellation it is always an unbiased estimator of
reduced shear. We show that moment-based techniques, adaptive or unweighted,
are similar to a model-based approach in the sense that they can be seen as
imperfect fit of an elliptical profile to the image. Due to residuals in the
fit, moment-based estimates of ellipticities are prone to underfitting bias
when inferred from observed images. The estimation is fundamentally limited
mainly by pixellation which destroys information on the original, pre-seeing
image. We give an optimized estimator for the pre-seeing GLAM ellipticity and
quantify its bias for noise-free images. To deal with pixel noise, we consider
a Bayesian approach where the posterior of the GLAM ellipticity can be
inconsistent with the true ellipticity if we do not properly account for our
ignorance about fit residuals. This underfitting bias is S/N-independent but
changes with the pre-seeing brightness profile and the correlation or
heterogeneity of pixel noise over the post-seeing image. Furthermore, when
inferring a constant ellipticity or, more relevantly, constant shear from a
source sample with a distribution of intrinsic properties (sizes, centroid
positions, intrinsic shapes), an additional, now noise-dependent bias arises
towards low S/N if incorrect priors for the intrinsic properties are used. We
discuss the origin of this prior bias.

some dozen known members in the Milky Way. The light variation is caused
predominantly by pulsations, but these alone do not explain the full complexity
of the light curves. High quality photometry of RV Tau-type stars is very rare.
DF Cygni is the only member of this class of stars in the original Kepler
field, hence allowing the most accurate photometric investigation of an RV
Tauri star to date. The main goal is to analyse the periodicities of the RV
Tauri-type star DF Cygni by combining four years of high-quality Kepler
photometry with almost half a century of visual data collected by the American
Association of Variable Star Observers. Kepler quarters of data have been
stitched together to minimize the systematic effects of the space data. The
mean levels have been matched with the AAVSO visual data. Both datasets have
been submitted to Fourier and wavelet analyses, while the stability of the main
pulsations has been studied with the O-C method and the analysis of the
time-dependent amplitudes. DF Cygni shows a very rich behaviour on all
time-scales. The slow variation has a period of 779.606 d and it has been
remarkably coherent during the whole time-span of the combined data. On top of
the long-term cycles the pulsations appear with a period of 24.925 d. Both
types of light variation significantly fluctuate in time, with a constantly
changing interplay of amplitude and phase modulations. The long-period change
(i.e. the RVb signature) somewhat resembles the Long Secondary Period (LSP)
phenomenon of the pulsating red giants, whereas the short-period pulsations are
very similar to those of the Cepheid variables. Comparing the pulsation
patterns with the latest models of Type-II Cepheids, we found evidence of
strong non-linear effects directly observable in the Kepler light curve.

input-output networks into uncertain and nominal subnetworks, when
uncertainties are defined in SLH representation. To this aim, two decomposition
theorems are stated, which show how an uncertain quantum network can be
decomposed into nominal and uncertain subnetworks in cascaded connection and
how uncertainties can be translated from SLH parameters into state-space
parameters. As a potential application of the proposed decomposition scheme,
robust stability analysis of uncertain quantum networks is briefly introduced.
The proposed uncertainty decomposition theorems take account of uncertainties
in all three parameters of a quantum network and bridge the gap between SLH
modeling and state-space robust analysis theory for linear quantum networks.

device in the compact muon solenoid (CMS) experiment at the large hadron
collider (LHC). As detectors 32 poly-crystalline (pCVD) diamond sensors are
positioned in rings around the beam pipe. Here, high particle rates occur from
the colliding beams scattering particles outside the beam pipe. These particles
cause defects, which act as traps for the ionization, thus reducing the charge
collection efficiency (CCE). However, the loss in CCE was much more severe than
expected from low rate laboratory measurements and simulations, especially in
single-crystalline (sCVD) diamonds, which have a low initial concentration of
defects. The reason why in real experiments the CCE is much worse than in
laboratory experiments is related to the ionization rate. At high particle
rates the trapping rate of the ionization is so high compared with the
detrapping rate, that space charge builds up. This space charge reduces locally
the internal electric field, which in turn increases the trapping rate and
recombination and hence reduces the CCE in a strongly non-linear way. A diamond
irradiation campaign was started to investigate the rate dependent electrical
field deformation with respect to the radiation damage. Besides the electrical
field measurements via the Transient Current Technique (TCT), the CCE was
measured. The experimental results were used to create an effective deep trap
model that takes the radiation damage into account. Using this trap model the
rate dependent electrical field deformation and the CCE were simulated with the
software SILVACO TCAD. The simulation, tuned to rate dependent measurements
from a strong radioactive source, was able to predict the non-linear decrease
of the CCE in the harsh environment of the LHC, where the particle rate was a
factor 30 higher.

occur and be enhanced by increasing both of annealing temperature and pressure.
By using double aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy,

that involves ""negative flow units"" with a higher atomic packing density

to the probability distribution of the data. The proposed generalization,
called measure-transformed GQLRT (MT-GQLRT), selects a Gaussian probability
model that best empirically fits a transformed probability measure of the data.
By judicious choice of the transform we show that, unlike the GQLRT, the
proposed test is resilient to outliers and involves higher-order statistical
moments leading to significant mitigation of the model mismatch effect on the
decision performance. Under some mild regularity conditions we show that the
MT-GQLRT is consistent and its corresponding test statistic is asymptotically
normal. A data driven procedure for optimal selection of the measure
transformation parameters is developed that maximizes an empirical estimate of
the asymptotic power given a fixed empirical asymptotic size. A Bayesian
extension of the proposed MT-GQLRT is also developed that is based on selection
of a Gaussian probability model that best empirically fits a transformed
conditional probability distribution of the data. In the Bayesian MT-GQLRT the
threshold and the measure transformation parameters are selected via joint
minimization of the empirical asymptotic Bayes risk. The non-Bayesian and
Bayesian MT-GQLRTs are applied to signal detection and classification, in
simulation examples that illustrate their advantages over the standard GQLRT

of 100 and Prandtl number of 0.7. The cylinders are iso-thermal and they are
aligned with the Earth acceleration (g). According to the array orientation, an
aiding or an opposing buoyancy is considered. The effect of natural convection
with respect to the forced convection is modulated with the Richardson number,
Ri, ranging between -1 and 1. Two values of center to center spacing (s=3.6d -
4d) are considered. The effects of buoyancy and spacing on the flow pattern in
the near and far field are described. Several transitions in the flow patterns
are found and a parametric analysis of the dependence of the force coefficients

Ri=-1, the change of spacing ratio from 3.6 to 4 induces a transition in the
standard deviation of the force coefficients and heat flux. In fact the
transition occurs due to rearrangement of the near field flow in a more ordered
wake pattern. Therefore, attention is focused on the influence of geometrical

considers a family of infinite utility functions F, and aims to find a size-k

  Studies on k-regret queries have focused on the family of additive utility
functions, which have limitations in modeling individuals' preferences and
decision making processes, especially for a common observation called the
diminishing marginal rate of substitution (DMRS). We introduce k-regret queries
with multiplicative utility functions, which are more expressive in modeling

bounded regret ratios. To showcase the applicability of the algorithm, we apply
it to a special family of multiplicative utility functions, the Cobb-Douglas

the Constant Elasticity of Substitution family of utility functions, both of
which are frequently used utility functions in microeconomics. After a further
study of the query properties, we propose a heuristic algorithm that produces

mathematical analysts, particularly the latter who do not understand (and/or

considered the most standard framework of computation over continuous spaces,
it is however defined in a very machine specific way which does not leave much
to intuitiveness. Recently several characterizations, in the form of function
algebras, of recursively computable functions and some sub-recursive classes
were introduced. These characterizations shed light on the hidden behavior of
recursive analysis as they convert complex computational operations on
sequences of real objects to ""simple"" intuitive mathematical operations such as
integration or taking limits. The authors previously presented a framework for
obtaining algebraic characterizations at the complexity level over compact
domains. The current paper presents a comprehensive extension to that
framework. Though we focus our attention in this paper on functions defined
over the whole real line, the framework, and accordingly the obtained results,
can be easily extended to functions defined over arbitrary domains.

the thermodynamic limit we show that the configurational entropy estimated from
standard computational approaches to characterize glassy states also diverges.
This reasoning would suggest that polydisperse materials cannot undergo a glass
transition, in contradiction to experiments. We explain that this argument
stems from the confusion between configurations in phase space and states
defined by free energy minima, and propose a simple method to compute a finite
and physically meaningful configurational entropy in continuously polydisperse
systems. Physically, the proposed approach relies on an effective description
of the system as an $M^*$-component system with a finite $M^*$, for which
finite mixing and configurational entropies are obtained. We show how to
directly determine $M^*$ from computer simulations in a range of glass-forming
models with different size polydispersities, characterized by hard and soft
interparticle interactions, and by additive and non-additive interactions. Our
approach provides consistent results in all cases and demonstrates that the

to quantify the thermal motion of atoms in crystals. ADPs are commonly derived
from diffraction experiments, but recent developments have also enabled their
first-principles prediction using periodic density functional theory (DFT).
Here, we combine experiments and dispersion-corrected DFT to quantify lattice
thermal expansion and ADPs in crystalline {\alpha}-sulfur (S8), a prototypical
elemental solid that is controlled by the interplay of covalent and van der
Waals interactions. We first report on single-crystal and powder X-ray
diffraction (XRD) measurements that provide new and improved reference data
from 10 K up to room temperature. We then use several popular
dispersion-corrected DFT methods to predict vibrational and thermal properties
of {\alpha}-sulfur, including the anisotropic lattice thermal expansion.
Hereafter, ADPs are derived in the commonly used harmonic approximation (in the
computed zero-Kelvin structure) and also in the quasi-harmonic approximation
(QHA) which takes the predicted lattice thermal expansion into account. At the
PBE+D3(BJ) level, the latter leads to excellent agreement with experiments.
Finally, more general implications of this study for realistic materials

Past work has focused upon points and trajectories for differentially-private

analytics, focusing not on point or path data, but on planar spatial regions.
Such data represents the area of a user's most frequent visitation---such as
""around home and nearby shops"". Specifically we consider the
differentially-private release of data structures that support range queries
for counting users' spatial regions. Counting planar regions leads to unique
challenges not faced in existing work. A user's spatial region that straddles
multiple data structure cells can lead to duplicate counting at query time. We
provably avoid this pitfall by leveraging the Euler characteristic for the
first time with differential privacy. To address the increased sensitivity of
range queries to spatial region data, we calibrate privacy-preserving noise
using bounded user region size and a constrained inference that uses robust
least absolute deviations. Our novel constrained inference reduces noise and
promotes covertness by (privately) imposing consistency. We provide a full
end-to-end theoretical analysis of both differential privacy and
high-probability utility for our approach using concentration bounds. A

The assignment of the spectra and their comparison throughout the whole series
allows correlating the phonon modes with the orthorhombic structural
distortions of RFeO3 perovskites. In particular, the positions of two specific
Ag modes scale linearly with the two FeO6 octahedra tilt angles, allowing the
distortion throughout the series. At variance with literature, we find that the

rate. This question was considered earlier for 824 late-type stars on the basis
of a consolidated catalogue of the soft X-ray fluxes. We carry out a more
refined analysis separately for G, K and M dwarfs. They distinctively exhibit
two modes of activity. The first one is the saturation mode, it is
characteristic of young stars and is practically not related to their rotation.
The second one refers to the solar-type activity the level of which strongly
depends on the rotation period. We show that the transition from one mode to
another takes place at the rotation periods of 1.1, 3.3 and 7.2 days for the
stars of spectral types G2, K4 and M3 respectively. In the light of the
discovery of superflares on G and K stars on the Kepler spacecraft there arises
a question of how these objects differ from other active late-type stars. We
analyse the location of superflare stars relative to the stars observed by
Kepler on the ""amplitude of rotational brightness modulation (ARM) -- rotation
period"" diagram. The value of ARM reflects the relative spots area on a star
and characterises the activity level in the whole atmosphere. It is shown that
G and K superflare stars are basically fast rotating young objects, but some of
them belong to the stars with the solar type of activity.

10$^{-46}$ cm$^{2}$. The DEAP-3600 background target is $<$ 0.6 background
events in the WIMP region of interest in 3 tonne-years. The strategies to
achieve this background include pulse shape discrimination to mitigate electron
recoil and using ultra low radioactive materials for detector construction.
Furthermore, to reduce neutron and alpha backgrounds, the DEAP-3600 acrylic
vessel was sanded in situ to mitigate radon exposure of surfaces during
construction and fabrication. The experiment is currently in the commissioning
phase and will begin physics data taking later this year. This paper presents
an overview of the experiment, its cross-section sensitivity to WIMPs and its

the growth processes of networks and to develop useful algorithms. One
remarkable example is the fractality of networks, which suggests the
self-similar organization of global network structure. To determine the
fractality of a network, we need to solve the so-called box-covering problem,
where preceding algorithms are not feasible for large-scale networks. The lack
of an efficient algorithm prevents us from investigating the fractal nature of
large-scale networks. To overcome this issue, we propose a new box-covering
algorithm based on recently emerging sketching techniques. We theoretically
show that it works in near-linear time with a guarantee of solution accuracy.
In experiments, we have confirmed that the algorithm enables us to study the
fractality of million-scale networks for the first time. We have observed that
its outputs are sufficiently accurate and that its time and space requirements

a number of impressive empirical successes and spawned many recent theoretical
investigations. However, the gap between dropout's training and inference
phases, introduced due to tractability considerations, has largely remained
under-appreciated. In this work, we first formulate dropout as a tractable
approximation of some latent variable model, leading to a clean view of
parameter sharing and enabling further theoretical analysis. Then, we introduce
(approximate) expectation-linear dropout neural networks, whose inference gap
we are able to formally characterize. Algorithmically, we show that our
proposed measure of the inference gap can be used to regularize the standard
dropout training objective, resulting in an \emph{explicit} control of the gap.
Our method is as simple and efficient as standard dropout. We further prove the
upper bounds on the loss in accuracy due to expectation-linearization, describe
classes of input distributions that expectation-linearize easily. Experiments
on three image classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that reducing the
inference gap can indeed improve the performance consistently.

group of the Einstein-Cartan theory is given by the semidirect product of the
local Lorentz group and the group of spacetime diffeomorphisms. Vanishing of
the integral generators of the gauge group is equivalent to equations of motion
of the Einstein-Cartan theory and the local constraints algebra is closed Lie
algebra.

are recorded and used to image the medium through which they travel. The
sources are typically modelled as a random variable and it is assumed that some
statistical information is available. In this paper we study the stochastic
wave equation $\partial_t^2 u - \Delta_g u = \chi W$, where $W$ is a random
variable with the white noise statistics on ${\mathbb R}^{1+n}$, $n \ge 3$,
$\chi$ is a smooth function vanishing for negative times and outside a compact
set in space, and $\Delta_g$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator associated to a
smooth non-trapping Riemannian metric tensor $g$ on ${\mathbb R}^n$. The metric
tensor $g$ models the medium to be imaged, and we assume that it coincides with
the Euclidean metric outside a compact set. We consider the empirical
correlations on an open set $\mathcal X \subset {\mathbb R}^n$, $$ C_T(t_1,
x_1, t_2, x_2) = \frac 1 T \int_0^T u(t_1+s,x_1) u(t_2+s,x_2) ds, \quad
t_1,t_2>0,\ x_1,x_2\in \mathcal X, $$ for $T>0$. Supposing that $\chi$ is
non-zero on $\mathcal X$ and constant in time after $t > 1$, we show that in
the limit $T \to \infty$, the data $C_T$ becomes statistically stable, that is,
independent of the realization of $W$. Our main result is that, with
probability one, this limit determines the Riemannian manifold $({\mathbb
R}^n,g)$ up to an isometry. To our knowledge, this is the first result showing
that a medium can be determined in a passive imaging setting, without assuming
a separation of scales.

of the side ledge thickness requires an accurate knowledge of the thermal

considerable lack of experimental data for the large majority of the phases
constituting the side ledge. The aim of this work is to provide, for each phase
possibly present in the side ledge, a formulation of the thermal conductivity
as a function of both temperature and size. To achieve this, we consider
reliable physical models linking the density of the lattice vibration energy
and the phonon mean free path to key parameters: the high temperature limit of
the Debye temperature and the Gruneisen constant. These model parameters can be
obtained by simultaneous fitting of (i) the heat capacity, (ii) the thermal
expansion tensor coefficient and (iii) the adiabatic elastic constants, on
relevant physical models. Where data is missing, first principles (ab initio)
calculations are used to determine directly the model parameters. For compounds
for which data is available, the model's predictions are found to be in very
good agreement with the reported experimental data.

significantly to solving the decades-old mystery of the origin of the
highest-energy cosmic rays. We investigate the ability of a future UHE neutrino
detector to identify the brightest neutrino point sources, by exploring the
parameter space of the total number of observed events and the angular
resolution of the detector. The favored parameter region can be translated to
requirements for the effective area, sky coverage and angular resolution of
future detectors, for a given source number density and evolution history.
Moreover, by studying the typical distance to sources that are expected to emit
more than one event for a given diffuse neutrino flux, we find that a
significant fraction of the identifiable UHE neutrino sources may be located in
the nearby Universe if the source number density is above $\sim10^{-6}\,\rm
Mpc^{-3}$. If sources are powerful and rare enough, as predicted in blazar
scenarios, they can first be detected at distant locations. Our result also
suggests that if UHE cosmic-ray accelerators are neither beamed nor transients,
it will be possible to associate the detected UHE neutrino sources with nearby
UHE cosmic-ray and gamma-ray sources, and that they may also be observed using
other messengers, including ones with limited horizons such as TeV gamma rays,
UHE gamma rays and cosmic rays. We find that for a $\gtrsim5\sigma$ detection

single cell sequencing yields valuable insights about gene expression profiles

complex human diseases. However, developing quantitative tools for such data
remains challenging because of high levels of technical noise, especially the
""dropout"" events. A ""dropout"" happens when the RNA for a gene fails to be
amplified prior to sequencing, producing a ""false"" zero in the observed data.
In this paper, we propose a Unified RNA-Sequencing Model (URSM) for both single
cell and bulk RNA-seq data, formulated as a hierarchical model. URSM borrows
the strength from both data sources and carefully models the dropouts in single
cell data, leading to a more accurate estimation of cell type specific gene
expression profile. In addition, URSM naturally provides inference on the
dropout entries in single cell data that need to be imputed for downstream
analyses, as well as the mixing proportions of different cell types in bulk
samples. We adopt an empirical Bayes approach, where parameters are estimated
using the EM algorithm and approximate inference is obtained by Gibbs sampling.
Simulation results illustrate that URSM outperforms existing approaches both in
correcting for dropouts in single cell data, as well as in deconvolving bulk
samples. We also demonstrate an application to gene expression data on fetal
brains, where our model successfully imputes the dropout genes and reveals cell
type specific expression patterns.

flight shortcuts that are given by air controllers to speed up the passage of
an aircraft within a certain airspace and therefore to facilitate airline
operations. Conflicts resolution between flight trajectories can arise during
the en-route phase of each flight due to both not detailed flight trajectory
planning or unforeseen events that perturb the planned flight plan. Our model
performs a local conflict detection and resolution procedure. Once a flight
trajectory has been made conflict-free, the model searches for possible

cycle of smooth rational curves meeting transversely. Cusp singularities come
in naturally dual pairs. Looijenga proved in 1981 that if a cusp singularity is
smoothable, the minimal resolution of the dual cusp is the anticanonical
divisor of some smooth rational surface. In 1983, the second author and Miranda
gave a criterion for smoothability of a cusp singularity, in terms of the
existence of a K-trivial semistable model for the central fiber of such a
smoothing. We study these ""Type III degenerations"" of rational surfaces with an
anticanonical divisor--their deformations, birational geometry, and monodromy.
Looijenga's original paper also gave a description of the rational double point
configurations to which a cusp singularity deforms, but only in the case where
the resolution of the dual cusp has cycle length 5 or less. We generalize this
classification to an arbitrary cusp singularity, giving an explicit
construction of a semistable simultaneous resolution of such an adjacency. The
main tools of the proof are (1) formulas for the monodromy of a Type III
degeneration, (2) a construction via surgeries on integral-affine surfaces of a
degeneration with prescribed monodromy, (3) surjectivity of the period map for
Type III central fibers, and (4) a theorem of Shepherd-Barron producing the
simultaneous contraction to the adjacency of the cusp singularity.

there can be no gauge equivalence. The proxy field is sometimes serviceable,
but its limitations are severe. One example is the ""above-threshold ionization""

predicted in advance of observation with a laser-field method. An
often-overlooked limitation is that numerical solution of the time-dependent
Schr\""odinger equation (TDSE) is exact for proxy fields, but not for laser
fields. Acceptance of proxy-field concepts has been costly in terms of
inefficiently deployed research resources. Calculations with a nearly-40-year
old transverse-field method remain unmatched with proxy fields. The
transverse-field method is applicable in the ""tunneling"" domain, the
""multiphoton"" domain, and, as shown here, in the low-frequency ""magnetic""

TDSE cannot be expected to produce meaningful results. They would be based on
inappropriate Maxwell equations, a non-existent virtual source, and would
approach constant electric field properties as the field frequency declines.
Laser fields propagate at the speed of light for all frequencies; they cannot
approach a constant-field limit. Extremely strong laser fields are
unambiguously relativistic; a nonrelativistic limit that connects continuously
to the relativistic domain is simpler conceptually and mathematically than is a

number of model evaluations. In particular, model based real-time control of
urban water infrastructures and online flood alarm systems require fast
prediction of the network response at different actuation and/or parameter
values. General purpose urban drainage simulators are too slow for this
application. Fast surrogate models, so-called emulators, provide a solution to
this efficiency demand. Emulators are attractive, because they sacrifice
unneeded accuracy in favor of speed. However, they have to be fine-tuned to
predict the system behavior satisfactorily. Also, some emulators fail to
extrapolate the system behavior beyond the training set. Although, there are
many strategies for developing emulators, up until now the selection of the
emulation strategy remains subjective. In this paper, we therefore compare the
performance of two families of emulators for open channel flows in the context
of urban drainage simulators. We compare emulators that explicitly use
knowledge of the simulator's equations, i.e. mechanistic emulators based on
Gaussian Processes, with purely data-driven emulators using matrix
factorization. Our results suggest that in many urban applications, naive
data-driven emulation outperforms mechanistic emulation. Nevertheless, we
discuss scenarios in which we think that mechanistic emulation might be
favorable for i) extrapolation in time and ii) dealing with sparse and unevenly
sampled data. We also provide many references to advances in the field of
Machine Learning that have not yet permeated into the Bayesian environmental
science community.

from the study of the ratios of DIS structure functions $F_2^A/F_2^D$ in nuclei

explosive growth of virtual-reality simulations opens up new possibilities to

Here we provide a computational model of time travel and a computer program
that allows exploring digital time travel. In order to explain our method we
formalize a simplified version of the famous grandfather paradox, show how the
system can allow the participant to go back in time, try to kill their
ancestors before they were born, and experience the consequences. The system
has even come up with scenarios that can be considered consistent ""solutions""
of the grandfather paradox. We discuss the conditions for digital time travel,
which indicate that it has a large number of practical applications.

something studied but used, there is a danger that the history itself will be

becomes the measure of the past. It is not surprising that reading today a
paper written more than a hundred years ago, we can extract much more of it
than was actually thought or dreamed by the author himself. We demonstrate this
Whiggish approach on the example of Woldemar Voigt's 1887 paper. From the
modern perspective, it may appear that this paper opens a way to both the
special relativity and to its anisotropic Finslerian generalization which came
into the focus only recently, in relation with the Cohen and Glashow's very
special relativity proposal. With a little imagination, one can connect Voigt's
paper to the notorious Einstein-Poincare priority dispute, which we believe is
a Whiggish late time artifact. We use the related historical circumstances to
give a broader view on special relativity, than it is usually anticipated.

outs using intelligent techniques. Thus, the present research work presents a
novel method for detection of fault disturbances based on Wavelet Transform
(WT) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The voltage signal is taken
offline under fault conditions and is being processed through wavelet and ICA
for detection. The time-frequency resolution from WT transform detects the
fault initiation instant in the signal. Again, a performance index is
calculated from independent component analysis under fault condition which is
used to detect the fault disturbance in the voltage signal. The proposed
approach is tested to be robust enough under various operating scenarios like
without noise, with 20-dB noise and variation in frequency. Further, the
detection study is carried out using a performance index, energy content, by
applying the existing Fourier transform (FT), short time Fourier transform
(STFT) and the proposed wavelet transform. Fault disturbances are detected if
the energy calculated in each scenario is greater than the corresponding
threshold value. The fault detection study is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink for
a typical power system.

embedded networked systems ranging from transportation structures to the human
body. Here we study the interplay between spontaneous damage, induced failure
and recovery in both embedded and non-embedded networks. In our model the
network's components follow three realistic processes that capture these
features: (i) spontaneous failure of a component independent of the
neighborhood (internal failure), (ii) failure induced by failed neighboring
nodes (external failure) and (iii) spontaneous recovery of a component.We
identify a metastable domain in the global network phase diagram spanned by the
model's control parameters where dramatic hysteresis effects and random
switching between two coexisting states are observed. The loss of
predictability due to these effects depend on the characteristic link length of
the embedded system. For the Euclidean lattice in particular, hysteresis and
switching only occur in an extremely narrow region of the parameter space
compared to random networks. We develop a unifying theory which links the
dynamics of our model to contact processes. Our unifying framework may help to
better understand predictability and controllability in spatially embedded and
random networks where spontaneous recovery of components can mitigate
spontaneous failure and damage spread in the global network.
