constrained Dirac neutrino mass matrix, involving one texture zero and two
independent Dirac masses, leading to a highly predictive scheme in which all
neutrino masses and the entire PMNS matrix is successfully predicted in terms
of just two real parameters. We calculate the renormalisation group (RG)
corrections to the LS predictions, with and without supersymmetry, including
also the threshold effects induced by the decoupling of heavy Majorana
neutrinos both analytically and numerically. We find that the predictions for
neutrino mixing angles and mass ratios are rather stable under RG corrections.
For example we find that the LS model with RG corrections predicts close to
maximal atmospheric mixing, $\theta_{23}=45^\circ \pm 1^\circ$, in most
considered cases, in tension with the latest NOvA results. The techniques used
here apply to other seesaw models with a strong normal mass hierarchy.

free-surface electrolytic flows subjected to a gradient in surface tension is
assessed. Firstly, for a Couette flow with fully resolved electric double layer
(EDL), the streaming potential per surface stress as a function of the Debye
parameter and surface potential is analyzed. By contrast to the Smoluchowski
limit in pressure-driven channel flow, the shear-induced streaming potential
vanishes for increasing Debye parameter (infinitely thin EDL), unless the free
surface contains (induced) surface charge or the flow at the charged, solid
wall is permitted to slip. Secondly, a technical realization of surface-tension
induced streaming is proposed, with surface stress acting on the free
(slipping) surfaces of a micro-structured, superhydrophobic wall. The streaming
potential is analyzed with respect to the slip parameter and surface charge.
Finally, the surface tension is assumed to vary with temperature
(thermocapillarity) or with surfactant concentration (destillocapillarity). The
maximal thermal efficiency is derived and compared to the Carnot efficiency.
For large thermal Marangoni number, the efficiency is severely limited by the
large heat capacity of aqueous solvents. By contrast, destillocapillary flows
may reach conversion efficiencies similar to pressure-driven flow.

the rest of molecular lines detected in the 30 GHz wide line survey performed
at 3 mm with IRAM 30m using ARTIST software. The core presents a rich chemistry
with emission from early (C3H2, HCN, CS) and late-time molecules (e.g., N2H+),
with a clear chemical spatial differentiation for nitrogen, oxygen and
sulphurated molecules. For most of the molecules detected (HCN, HCO+, CH3OH,
CS, SO, 13CO and C18O), abundances are best fitted with three values,
presenting a clear decrease of abundance of at least 1 or 2 orders of magnitude
towards the center of the core. The Bonnor-Ebert analysis indicates the core is
gravitationally unstable and the magnetic field is not strong enough to avoid
the collapse. Depletion of molecules onto the dust grains occurs at the
interior of the core, where dust grain growth and dust depolarization also
occurs. This suggests that these properties may be related. On the other hand,
some molecules exhibit asymmetries in their integrated emission maps, which

sampling such as Langevin dynamics. We observe that the two learning algorithms
can be seamlessly interwoven into a cooperative learning algorithm that can
train both models simultaneously. Specifically, within each iteration of the
cooperative learning algorithm, the generator model generates initial
synthesized examples to initialize a finite-step MCMC that samples and trains
the energy-based descriptor model. After that, the generator model learns from
how the MCMC changes its synthesized examples. That is, the descriptor model
teaches the generator model by MCMC, so that the generator model accumulates
the MCMC transitions and reproduces them by direct ancestral sampling. We call
this scheme MCMC teaching. We show that the cooperative algorithm can learn
highly realistic generative models.

we introduce a canonical approach structure, called the contractive approach

ingredients of the proof of this result are Dini's Theorem, Ascoli's Theorem,
and the fact that the class of real-valued contractions on a metric space has

different well-posed formulations of the problem are studied through
discretization by the finite element method, and preconditioning strategies
based on operator preconditioning are discussed. For each formulation we derive
preconditioners that are independent of the discretization parameter.
Preconditioners that are robust with respect to the first Lam\'e constant are
constructed for the pure displacement formulations, while a preconditioner that
is robust in both Lam\'e constants is constructed for the mixed formulation. It
is shown that, for convergence in the first Sobolev norm, it is crucial to
respect the orthogonality constraint derived from the continuous problem. Based
on this observation a modification to the conjugate gradient method is proposed
that achieves optimal error convergence of the computed solution.

rotating regular black hole with a non-linear magnetic monopole (NLMM). One
problem in this study would be whether our geometry can be a solution or not.
We search for the way making our rotating geometry into a solution based on the
fact that the Schwarzschild regular black hole geometry with a NLMM can be a
solution. However, in the attempt to extend the Schwarzschild case that we can
naturally consider, it turns out that it is impossible to construct a model in
which our geometry can be a exact solution. We manage this problem by making
use of the fact that our geometry can be a solution approximately in the whole
space-time except for the black hole's core region. As a next problem, it turns
out that the equation to obtain the horizon radii is given by a fifth-order
equation due to the regularization effect. We overcome this problem by treating
the regularization effect perturbatively. As a result, we can obtain the
near-horizon extremal Kerr (NHEK) geometry with the correction of the
regularization effect. Once obtaining the NHEK geometry, we can obtain the
central charge and the Frolov-Thorne temperature in the dual CFT. Using these,
we compute its entropy through the Cardy formula, which agrees with the one
computed from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.

Liouville results for the random conductance model on a supercritical
(Bernoulli bond) percolation cluster. The results are also new in the case that
the conductivity is constant on the cluster. The argument passes through a
series of renormalization steps: first, we use standard percolation results to
find a large scale above which the geometry of the percolation cluster behaves
(in a sense made precise) like that of Euclidean space. Then, following the
work of Barlow, we find a succession of larger scales on which certain
functional and elliptic estimates hold. This gives us the analytic tools to
adapt the quantitative homogenization program of Armstrong and Smart to
estimate the yet larger scale on which solutions on the cluster can be
well-approximated by harmonic functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$. This is the first
quantitative homogenization result in a porous medium and the harmonic
approximation allows us to estimate the scale on which a higher-order
regularity theory holds. The size of each of these random scales is shown to
have at least a stretched exponential moment. As a consequence of this
regularity theory, we obtain a Liouville-type result that states that, for each
$k\in\mathbb{N}$, the vector space of solutions growing at most like
$o(|x|^{k+1})$ as $|x|\to \infty$ has the same dimension as the set of harmonic
polynomials of degree at most $k$, generalizing a result of Benjamini,

properties of polymer composites. These interactions give rise to an interface
with specific properties that may have a nontrivial effect on the macroscopic
properties of composites. Direct measurement of the interface properties at
nanometer scale is usually unavailable. Thus, interface properties are often
back calculated from the bulk response using a computational model. However, if
the model does not take into account the morphology of the filler dispersion,
the results can be misleading. Recently it has been found that the dielectric
response of a carbon black filled natural rubber film can change dramatically
upon stretching [Huang, Macromolecules 49, 2339 (2016)]1. In this paper, we
will show that this phenomenon can be largely explained by changes in filler
cluster connectivity due to strain and is probably not caused by changes in the
interfacial interactions. To support the argument, the polarization mechanism
of the composites in the measured frequency range is analyzed and numerical
models are developed to virtually reproduce the physical phenomenon as a
function of strain. As a result, a power-law dependence of dielectric
permittivity with strain is derived, which matches closely with the
experimental results.

Diagrammatic Abstract Reasoning is an avenue in which diagrams evolve in
complex patterns and one needs to infer the underlying pattern sequence and
generate the next image in the sequence. For this, we develop a novel
Contextual Generative Adversarial Network based on Recurrent Neural Networks
(Context-RNN-GANs), where both the generator and the discriminator modules are
based on contextual history (modeled as RNNs) and the adversarial discriminator
guides the generator to produce realistic images for the particular time step
in the image sequence. We evaluate the Context-RNN-GAN model (and its variants)
on a novel dataset of Diagrammatic Abstract Reasoning, where it performs
competitively with 10th-grade human performance but there is still scope for
interesting improvements as compared to college-grade human performance. We
also evaluate our model on a standard video next-frame prediction task,
achieving improved performance over comparable state-of-the-art.

These intersection representations can be interpreted as covering

supported vertically against gravity by a strong toroidal ($\phi-$direction)
magnetic field that develops naturally as the result of an accretion disk
dynamo. The magnetic pressure elevates most of the gas carrying the accretion
flow at $R$ to large heights $z > 0.1 R$ and low densities, while leaving a
thin dense layer containing most of the mass --- but contributing very little
accretion --- around the equator. We show that such a disk model leads
naturally to the formation of a broad emission line region through thermal
instability. Extrapolating to larger radii, we demonstrate that local
gravitational instability and associated star formation are strongly suppressed
compared to standard disk models for AGN, although star formation in the
equatorial zone is predicted for sufficiently high mass supply rates. This new
class of accretion disk models thus appears capable of resolving two
longstanding puzzles in the theory of AGN fueling: the formation of broad
emission line regions and the suppression of fragmentation thought to inhibit
accretion at the required rates. We show that the disk of stars that formed in
the Galactic Center a few million years ago could have resulted from an episode
of magnetically elevated accretion at $> 0.1$ of the Eddington limit.

stiffness of the solid structure, the poromechanical coupling between the fluid
and the solid has an increasingly strong impact on the flow. For very large
pressures or very soft materials, as is the case for hydraulic fracturing and
arterial flows, this coupling can lead to large deformations and, hence, to
strong deviations from a classical, linear-poroelastic response. Here, we study
this problem by analysing the steady-state response of a poroelastic cylinder
to fluid injection. We consider the qualitative and quantitative impacts of
kinematic and constitutive nonlinearity, highlighting the strong impact of
deformation-dependent permeability. We show that the wall thickness (thick vs.

which impacts their mechanical properties. Yet, aside from scattered empirical
observations, little is known about the gel drying kinetics for which there is
a lack of temporally and spatially resolved measurements. Here we report a
benchmark study of the slow drying of agarose gels cast in cylindrical Petri
dishes. The weak adhesion of the gel to the lateral wall of the dish guarantees
that the gel diameter remains constant during the drying process and that the
gel shrinkage is purely vertical. The thinning rate is monitored by in-situ
interferometry using a Michelson interferometer. The displacement of
interference fringes are analyzed using an original spatiotemporal filtering
method, which allows us to measure local thinning rates of about 10~nm/s with
high accuracy. Experiments conducted at different positions along the gel
radius show that the gel thins locally with a constant velocity before
experiencing a sudden collapse at the end of the drying process. We further use
the thinning rate measured at the center of the dish during the early stage of
the drying process as a robust observable to quantify the role of additives on
the gel drying kinetics and compare gels of different compositions. Our work
exemplifies interferometry as a powerful tool to quantify the impact of minute

ill-posed, we demonstrate that prior knowledge about how 3D shapes of vehicles

shapes (back-)project from 2D to 3D. We encode this knowledge in \emph{shape
priors}, which are learnt over a small keypoint-annotated dataset. We then
formulate a shape-aware adjustment problem that uses the learnt shape priors to
recover the 3D pose and shape of a query object from an image. For shape
representation and inference, we leverage recent successes of Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) for the task of object and keypoint localization, and
train a novel cascaded fully-convolutional architecture to localize vehicle
\emph{keypoints} in images. The shape-aware adjustment then robustly recovers
shape (3D locations of the detected keypoints) while simultaneously filling in
occluded keypoints. To tackle estimation errors incurred due to erroneously
detected keypoints, we use an Iteratively Re-weighted Least Squares (IRLS)
scheme for robust optimization, and as a by-product characterize noise models
for each predicted keypoint. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving

the initial neutrino phase space density and the cold dark matter gravitational
potential. The latter is a new coupling between neutrinos and large scale
structure not described by previous fluid approaches. We compute the sound
speed in linear theory and find that it asymptotes to constants at small and
large scales regardless of the gravitational potential. By comparing with
neutrino N-body simulations, we measure the small scale sound speed and find it
to be lower than linear theory predictions. This allows for an explanation of
the discrepency between N-body and linear response predictions for the neutrino
power spectrum: neutrinos are still driven predominantly by the cold dark
matter, but the sound speed on small scales is not stable to perturbations and
decreases. Finally, we present a calibrated model for the neutrino power
spectrum that requires no additional integrations outside of standard Boltzmann

demand, many transit authorities have implemented managed lane policies.
Managed lanes typically run parallel to a freeway's standard, general-purpose
(GP) lanes, but are restricted to certain types of vehicles. It was originally
thought that managed lanes would improve the use of existing infrastructure
through incentivization of demand-management behaviors like carpooling, but
implementations have often been characterized by unpredicted phenomena that is
often to detrimental system performance.
  This paper presents several macroscopic traffic modeling tools we have used
for study of freeways equipped with managed lanes, or ""managed lane-freeway
networks."" The proposed framework is based on the widely-used first-order
kinematic wave theory. In this model, the GP and the managed lanes are modeled
as parallel links connected by nodes, where certain type of traffic may switch
between GP and managed lane links. Two types of managed lane topologies are
considered: full-access, where vehicles can switch between the GP and the
managed lanes anywhere; and separated, where such switching is allowed only at
certain locations called gates.
  We also describe methods to incorporate in three phenomena into our model
that are particular to managed lane-freeway networks. The inertia effect
reflects drivers' inclination to stay in their lane as long as possible and
switch only if this would obviously improve their travel condition. The
friction effect reflects the empirically-observed driver fear of moving fast in
a managed lane while traffic in the adjacent GP lanes moves slowly due to
congestion. The smoothing effect describes how managed lanes can increase
throughput at bottlenecks by reducing lane changes. We present simple models
for each of these phenomena that fit within the general macroscopic theory.

of the (equivariant) Hilbert scheme of the orbifold into affine space strata
indexed by a certain combinatorial set, the set of Young walls. The generating
series of Euler characteristics of Hilbert schemes of points of the singular
surface of type A or D is computed in terms of an explicit formula involving a
specialized character of the basic representation of the corresponding affine

results are consistent with known results for type A, and are new for type D.
The crystal basis theory of the fundamental representation of the affine Lie

plays an important role in our approach. The result gives a generalization of
G\""ottsche's formula and has interesting modular properties related to the
S-duality conjecture.
  The moduli space of torsion free sheaves on surfaces are higher rank analogs
of the Hilbert schemes. In type A our results reveal their Euler characteristic
generating function as well. Another very interesting class of normal surface
singularities is the so-called cyclic quotient singularities of type (p,1). As
an outlook we also obtain some results about the associated generating

phase diagram of the system as a function of the Zeeman field and the phase
difference between the two superconductors (treated as an externally controlled
parameter). Remarkably, at a phase difference of $\pi$, the topological phase
is obtained for almost any value of the Zeeman field and chemical potential. In
a setup where the phase is not controlled externally, we find that the system
undergoes a first-order topological phase transition when the Zeeman field is
varied. At the transition, the phase difference in the ground state changes
abruptly from a value close to zero, at which the system is trivial, to a value
close to $\pi$, at which the system is topological. The critical current
through the junction exhibits a sharp minimum at the critical Zeeman field, and
is therefore a natural diagnostic of the transition. We point out that in

(PLD) govern the electronic properties in many layered transition-metal
dichalcogenides. In particular, 1T-TaS2 undergoes a metal-to-insulator phase
transition as the PLD becomes commensurate with the crystal lattice. Here we
directly image PLDs of the nearly-commensurate (NC) and commensurate (C) phases
in thin exfoliated 1T-TaS2 using atomic resolution scanning transmission
electron microscopy at room and cryogenic temperature. At low temperatures, we
observe commensurate PLD superstructures, suggesting ordering of the CDWs both
in- and out-of-plane. In addition, we discover stacking transitions in the
atomic lattice that occur via one bond length shifts. Interestingly, the NC
PLDs exist inside both the stacking domains and their boundaries. Transitions
in stacking order are expected to create fractional shifts in the CDW between
layers and may be another route to manipulate electronic phases in layered
dichalcogenides.

be correlated, then there should be a causal explanation of these correlations.
Furthermore, if the explanation is in terms of a common cause, then the
conditional probability distribution over the variables given the complete
common cause should factorize. The principle is generalized by the formalism of
causal models, in which the causal relationships among variables constrain the
form of their joint probability distribution. In the quantum case, however, the
observed correlations in Bell experiments cannot be explained in the manner
Reichenbach's principle would seem to demand. Motivated by this, we introduce a
quantum counterpart to the principle. We demonstrate that under the assumption
that quantum dynamics is fundamentally unitary, if a quantum channel with input
A and outputs B and C is compatible with A being a complete common cause of B
and C, then it must factorize in a particular way. Finally, we show how to
generalize our quantum version of Reichenbach's principle to a formalism for
quantum causal models, and provide examples of how the formalism works.

In the weak basis where a quark mass matrix is nonsingular and has six zeroes

also found that all pairs composed of a nonsingular matrix with five zeroes and

an energy-dependent interaction, which can be interpreted to implement missing
channel contributions. We also discuss general properties of the two-body wave

believed to determine the morphology of galaxies within a $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology. We study this hypothesis by considering approximately 18,000 central
galaxies at $z=0$ with stellar masses $M_{\ast} = 10^{9}-10^{12} \, {\rm
M}_{\odot}$ selected from the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamic simulation.
The fraction of accreted stars -- which measures the importance of massive,
recent and dry mergers -- increases steeply with galaxy stellar mass, from less
than 5 per cent in dwarfs to 80 per cent in the most massive objects, and the
impact of mergers on galaxy morphology increases accordingly. For galaxies with
$M_{\ast} \gtrsim 10^{11} \, {\rm M}_{\odot}$, mergers have the expected
effect: if gas-poor they promote the formation of spheroidal galaxies, whereas
gas-rich mergers favour the formation and survivability of massive discs. This
trend, however, breaks at lower masses. For objects with $M_{\ast} \lesssim
10^{11} \, {\rm M}_{\odot}$, mergers do not seem to play any significant role
in determining the morphology, with accreted stellar fractions and mean merger
gas fractions that are indistinguishable between spheroidal and disc-dominated
galaxies. On the other hand, halo spin correlates with morphology primarily in
the least massive objects in the sample ($M_{\ast} \lesssim 10^{10} \, {\rm
M}_{\odot}$), but only weakly for galaxies above that mass. Our results support
a scenario where (1) mergers play a dominant role in shaping the morphology of
massive galaxies, (2) halo spin is important for the morphology of dwarfs, and
(3) the morphology of medium-sized galaxies -- including the Milky Way -- shows
little dependence on galaxy assembly history or halo spin, at least when these
two factors are considered individually.

dominant, the main galaxy has a stellar mass $\sim 2\times 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$
and a star formation rate $\sim 20$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The galaxy sits near
the expected main sequence of star-forming galaxies at those redshifts, and
resembles moderately star-forming systems observed at $z>5$. The high specific
star formation rate results in vigorous heating and stirring of the gas by
supernovae feedback, and the galaxy develops a thick and turbulent disc, with
gas velocity dispersion $\sim 40$ km s$^{-1}$, rotation to dispersion ratio
$\sim 2$, and with a significant amount of gas at $\sim 10^5$ K. The Toomre
parameter always exceeds the critical value for gravito-turbulence, $Q\sim
1.5-2$, mainly due to the contribution of warm/hot gas inside the disc. Without
feedback, a nearly gravito-turbulent regime establishes with similar gas
velocity dispersion and lower $Q$. We propose that the ""hot and turbulent"" disc
regime seen in our simulations, unlike the ""cold and turbulent""
gravito-turbulent regime of massive clumpy disc galaxies at $z\sim 1-2$, is a
fundamental characterisation of main sequence galaxies at $z\gtrsim 6$, as they
can sustain star formation rates comparable to those of low-mass starbursts at
$z=0$. This results in no sustained coherent gas inflows through the disc, and
in fluctuating and anisotropic mass transport, possibly postponing the assembly
of the bulge and causing the initial feeding of the central black hole to be
highly intermittent.

produced by a relativistic jet and/or small radio lobes. The observed radio
morphology, the lack of a significant core and the presence of a low frequency

the EVN map is lower than the value predicted using the turnover/size relation
valid for CSS sources (~6kpc). This discrepancy can be explained by an
additional component not detected in our observations, accounting for about a
quarter of the total source flux density, combined to projection effects. The
low core-dominance of the source (CD<0.29) confirms that

of the phase function of the dust grains that reside in the disk surface which
is essential for our understanding of protoplanetary dust properties and the
early stages of planet formation. We aim to construct a method which takes into
account how the flaring shape of the scattering surface of an (optically thick)
protoplanetary disk projects onto the image plane of the observer. This allows
us to map physical quantities (scattering radius and scattering angle) onto
scattered light images and retrieve stellar irradiation corrected (r^2-scaled)
images and dust phase functions. We apply the method on archival polarized
intensity images of the protoplanetary disk around HD 100546 that were obtained
with VLT/SPHERE in R'-band and VLT/NACO in H- and Ks-band. The brightest side
of the r^2-scaled R'-band polarized intensity image of HD 100546 changes from
the far to the near side of the disk when a flaring instead of a geometrically
flat disk surface is used for the r^2-scaling. The decrease in polarized
surface brightness in the scattering angle range of ~40-70 deg is likely a
result of the dust phase function and degree of polarization which peak in
different scattering angle regimes. The derived phase functions show part of a
forward scattering peak which indicates that large, aggregate dust grains
dominate the scattering opacity in the disk surface. Projection effects of a
protoplanetary disk surface need to be taken into account to correctly
interpret scattered light images. Applying the correct scaling for the
correction of stellar irradiation is crucial for the interpretation of the
images and the derivation of the dust properties in the disk surface layer.

A, with distinct groups of BH and NS XBs separated at y~0.9 and A~3. The
electron temperature kTe can occupy a broad range in BH systems, from
kTe~30-200 keV, whereas for NSs kTe is peaked at ~15-25 keV, but can extend to
higher values. The difference between BHs and NSs in y implies that kTe is
higher at a given optical depth for BH XBs. Our results also imply that for NS
systems the accreting material loses ~1/2-2/3 of its energy through
Comptonisation in the corona. The remaining energy is released on the surface
of the neutron star, making it a powerful source of soft radiation, which
alters the properties of the Comptonising corona. Finally, we find evidence at
the 2.4 sigma confidence level that Comptonisation parameters may be correlated

Thirdly, the empirical validation of the approach on artificial and real-world
problems demonstrates the generality and effectiveness of the method. On
artificial problems, the proposed regularization subsumes the Total Variation
minimization and recovers the expected decomposition. On the real-world problem
of electro-encephalography brainwave decomposition, the approach outperforms
similar approaches in terms of P300 evoked potentials detection, using
structured spatial priors to guide the decomposition.

the field of compressive sensing (CS). Currently, CS favors incoherent systems,
in which any two measurements are as little correlated as possible. In reality,
however, many problems are coherent, and conventional methods such as $L_1$
minimization do not work well. Recently, the difference of the $L_1$ and $L_2$
norms, denoted as $L_1$-$L_2$, is shown to have superior performance over the
classic $L_1$ method, but it is computationally expensive. We derive an
analytical solution for the proximal operator of the $L_1$-$L_2$ metric, and it
makes some fast $L_1$ solvers such as forward-backward splitting (FBS) and
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) applicable for $L_1$-$L_2$.
We describe in details how to incorporate the proximal operator into FBS and
ADMM and show that the resulting algorithms are convergent under mild

original implementation of $L_1$-$L_2$ based on a difference-of-convex approach

designed and tested for the simulation of collisions of peakompactons. In

models and, based on the independence approximation, we approximate them with
two respective difference equations systems.
  Theoretical analysis on these two approximation models reveals the dependency
of the systems' asymptotic behavior on the structures of both the
product-conversion graph and the social network, as well as the initial
condition. In addition to the theoretical work, accuracy of the independence
approximation and the asymptotic behavior of the Markov-chain model are
investigated via numerical analysis, for the case where social conversion
occurs before self conversion.
  Finally, we propose a class of multi-player and multi-stage competitive
propagation games and discuss the seeding-quality trade-off, as well as the
allocation of seeding resources among the individuals. We investigate the
unique Nash equilibrium at each stage and analyze the system's behavior when
every player is adopting the policy at the Nash equilibrium.

  Metrics",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dasgupta recently introduced a cost function for the hierarchical clustering
of a set of points given pairwise similarities between them. He showed that
this function is NP-hard to optimize, but a top-down recursive partitioning
heuristic based on an alpha_n-approximation algorithm for uniform sparsest cut
gives an approximation of O(alpha_n log n) (the current best algorithm has
alpha_n=O(sqrt{log n})). We show that the aforementioned sparsest cut heuristic
in fact obtains an O(alpha_n)-approximation for hierarchical clustering. The
algorithm also applies to a generalized cost function studied by Dasgupta.
Moreover, we obtain a strong inapproximability result, showing that the
hierarchical clustering objective is hard to approximate to within any constant
factor assuming the Small-Set Expansion (SSE) Hypothesis. Finally, we discuss
approximation algorithms based on convex relaxations. We present a spreading
metric SDP relaxation for the problem and show that it has integrality gap at
most O(sqrt{log n}). The advantage of the SDP relative to the sparsest cut
heuristic is that it provides an explicit lower bound on the optimal solution
and could potentially yield an even better approximation for hierarchical
clustering. In fact our analysis of this SDP served as the inspiration for our
improved analysis of the sparsest cut heuristic. We also show that a spreading

spin-polarized in the direction along the arcs, thus highlighting TaIrTe$_4$ as

disentagle the different ways that additive Gaussian noise may influence the

to a Laplacian decomposition for the sub-graphs for Blue and Red. Under the
linearisation ansatz that the oscillators of each respective network remain
relatively phase-sychronised centroids or clusters, we are able to obtain
simple closed-form expressions using the Fokker-Planck approach for the
dynamics of the average angle of the two centroids. In some cases, this leads
to subtle effects of metastability that we may analytically describe using the
theory of ratchet potentials. These considerations are extended to a regime
where one of the populations has fragmented in two. The analytic expressions we
derive largely predict the dynamics of the non-linear system seen in numerical
simulation. In particular, we find that noise acting on a more tightly coupled
population allows for improved synchronisation of the other population where
deterministically it is fragmented.

trajectory by a hoop robot in the presence of disturbances and uncertainties.
The hoop robot, consisting of a circular body rolling without slip along a
one-dimensional surface, is a planar analog of a spherical robot. A variety of
coupled mechanical system may be used to actuate the hoop robot. This paper
specifically considers two different actuators, one a simple pendulum and the
other an internal cart. The geometric PID controller requires the plant to be a
mechanical system, and the hoop robot does not satisfy this condition.
Therefore a geometric inner loop is presented that gives the hoop robot the
required structure. This procedure is here referred to as feedback
regularization. Feedback regularization--in contrast to feedback
linearization--is coordinate independent, and hence reflects the fundamental
system structure. Note also that the resulting mechanical system is nonlinear
and underactuated. Subsequently, the geometric PID outer loop guarantees
almost-semiglobal tracking with locally exponential convergence, and the
integral action of the PID guarantees robustness to constant disturbances and
parameter uncertainties, including constant inclination of the rolling surface.
The complete tracking controller is the composition of the two
coordinate-independent loops, and therefore is also coordinate independent.

(equivalently represented by Eddington ratio $\lambda_{Edd}$), and optical
classification, is investigated by applying the X-ray spectra stacking method
to a large sample of AGN which have well measured optical parameters. A broad
line feature is detected ($>3\sigma$) in the stacked spectra of the high
$\lambda_{Edd}$ sub-sample ($\log\lambda_{Edd}>-0.9$). The profile of the broad
line can be well fitted with relativistic broad line model, with the line
energy consistent with highly ionized Fe K$\alpha$ line (i.e. Fe xxvi). A model
consisting of multiple narrow lines cannot be ruled out, however. We found
hints that the Fe K line becomes broader as the $\lambda_{Edd}$ increases. No
broad line feature is shown in the sub-sample of broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLS1)
galaxies and in the full sample, while a broad line might be present, though at
low significance, in the sub-sample of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies.
We find no strong dependence of the broad line on black hole masses. Our
results indicate that the detection/properties of the broad Fe K$\alpha$ line
may strongly depend on $\lambda_{Edd}$, which can be explained if the
ionization state and/or truncation radius of the accretion disc changes with
$\lambda_{Edd}$. The non-detection of the broad line in the BLS1 sub-sample can
be explained if the the average EW of the relativistic Fe K$\alpha$ line is
weak or/and the fraction of sources with relativistic Fe K$\alpha$ line is

$3^n$-state Markov chains. Ostensibly, because analyzing such Markov chains is
too complicated, their $O(n)$-dimensional nonlinear ""mean-field"" approximation,
and its linearization, are often studied instead. We provide a complete global
analysis of the epidemic dynamics of the nonlinear mean-field approximation. In
particular, we show that depending on the largest eigenvalue of the underlying
graph adjacency matrix and the rates of infection, recovery, and vaccination,
the global dynamics takes on one of two forms: either the epidemic dies out, or
it converges to another unique fixed point (the so-called endemic state where a
constant fraction of the nodes remain infected). A similar result has also been
shown in the continuous-time case. We tie in these results with the ""true""

upper-bound on the true probabilities of infection that involves only
marginals, and that, even though the nonlinear model is not an upper-bound on
the true probabilities in general, it does provide an upper-bound on the
probability of the chain not being absorbed. As a consequence, we also show
that when the disease-free fixed point is globally stable for the mean-field

epidemic dies out quickly. We compare and summarize the results on different

transition temperature $T_{c}$ is found in a region of the phase diagram where
the antiferromagnetic transition temperature extrapolates to zero, signaling a
putative quantum critical point. The elucidation of the interplay between these
two phenomena - high-$T_{c}$ superconductivity and magnetic quantum criticality
- remains an important piece of the complex puzzle of unconventional
superconductivity. In this paper, we combine sign-problem-free Quantum Monte
Carlo simulations and field-theoretical analytical calculations to unveil the
microscopic mechanism responsible for the superconducting instability of a
general low-energy model, called spin-fermion model. In this approach,
low-energy electronic states interact with each other via the exchange of
quantum critical magnetic fluctuations. We find that even in the regime of
moderately strong interactions, both the superconducting transition temperature
and the pairing susceptibility are governed not by the properties of the entire
Fermi surface, but instead by the properties of small portions of the Fermi
surface called hot spots. Moreover, $T_{c}$ increases with increasing
interaction strength, until it starts to saturate at the crossover from
hot-spots dominated to Fermi-surface dominated pairing. Our work provides not
only invaluable insights into the system parameters that most strongly affect
$T_{c}$, but also important benchmarks to assess the origin of
superconductivity in both microscopic models and actual materials.

AFM tip, the diffusions between the two HUCs are almost symmetric with the
energy barrier of about 1 eV in the both directions. The diffusion is a
two-step process with an intermediate metastable configuration in which the Ag
atom is at the boundary of the HUCs. With the presence of the tip, we find that
the reaction pathways are essentially the same, but the energy barrier in one
direction is substantially reduced to be 0.2 - 0.4 eV by the tip, while that of
the diffusion in the reverse direction remains larger than 1 eV. The Si tip
reduces the energy barrier more than the Pt tip due to the flexibility of the
tip apex structure. In addition to the reduction of the barrier, the tip traps
the diffusing adatom preventing the diffusion in the reverse direction. Also we
find that the shape of the tip apex structure is important for the trapping
ability of the adatom. When the tip apex structure is blunt, the adatom
interacts with the tip atom other than the tip apex atom. The bond formation
between the AFM tip atom and the surface adatom is essential for the atom
manipulation using the AFM tip. Our results show that the atom manipulation is
possible with both the metallic and semiconducting AFM tips.

2013 July. During the active period, the $\gamma$-ray flux increased by more
than a factor of three and two distinct flares were detected with the

  The $\gamma$-ray spectra can be well fitted by a log-parabola. From the
fitting, we find a correlation between the peak energy and spectral curvature
for the $\gamma$-ray spectra, which is the first time seen in $\gamma$-ray
emission from a blazar. The {\it Swift} X-ray Telescope (XRT) data show that
the source was variable at X-ray energies, but no evidence shows flux or
spectral changes related to the $\gamma$-ray activity. The broad-band X-ray
spectrum obtained with {\it Swift} XRT and {\it NuSTAR} is well described by a
broken PL model, with an extremely hard spectrum ($\Gamma_{1} \sim 0.1$) below
the break energy, $E_{\rm break} \sim 2.1 {\rm keV}$, and $\Gamma_{2} \sim 1.5$

due to the low energy cut-off in the energy distribution of the photon-emitting

widely used as a control method for a brain-computer interface (BCI), allowing
communication for the physically impaired. The performance of MI based BCI
mainly depends on the subject's ability to self-modulate EEG signals. Proper
training can help naive subjects learn to modulate brain activity proficiently.
However, training subjects typically involves abstract motor tasks and is
time-consuming. To improve the performance of naive subjects during motor
imagery, a novel paradigm was presented that would guide naive subjects to
modulate brain activity effectively. In this new paradigm, pictures of the left
or right hand were used as cues for subjects to finish the motor imagery task.
Fourteen healthy subjects (11 male, aged 22-25 years, mean 23.6+/-1.16)
participated in this study. The task was to imagine writing a Chinese
character. Specifically, subjects could imagine hand movements following the
sequence of writing strokes in the Chinese character. This paradigm was meant
to find an effective and familiar action for most Chinese people, to provide
them with a specific, extensively practiced task and help them modulate brain
activity. Results showed that the writing task paradigm yielded significantly
better performance than the traditional arrow paradigm (p<0.001). Questionnaire
replies indicated that most subjects thought the new paradigm was easier and
more comfortable. The proposed new motor imagery paradigm could guide subjects
to help them modulate brain activity effectively. Results showed that there
were significant improvements using new paradigm, both in classification
accuracy and usability.

astromolecules using high level ab initio quantum chemical calculations. A
total of 130 molecules comprising of 31 isomeric groups and 24
cyanide/isocyanide pairs with atoms ranging from 3 to 12 have been considered.
The results show an interesting, surprisingly not well explored, relationship
between energy, stability and abundance (ESA) existing among these molecules.
Among the isomeric species, isomers with lower enthalpies of formation are more
easily observed in the interstellar medium compared to their counterparts with
higher enthalpies of formation. Available data in literature confirm the high
abundance of the most stable isomer over other isomers in the different groups
considered. Potential for interstellar hydrogen bonding accounts for the few
exceptions observed. Thus, in general, it suffices to say that the interstellar
abundances of related species are directly proportional to their stabilities.
The immediate consequences of this relationship in addressing some of the whys
and wherefores among astromolecules and in predicting some possible candidates
for future astronomical observations are discussed. Our comprehensive results
on 130 molecules indicate that the available experimental enthalpy of formation
for some molecules, such as NaCN, may be less reliable and new measurements may
be needed.

over rate-limited communication channels subject to unknown, bounded delay. On
one hand, the timing of event triggering carries implicit information about the
state of the plant. On the other hand, the delay in the communication channel
causes information loss, as it makes the state information available at the
controller out of date. Combining these two effects, we show a phase transition
behavior in the transmission rate required for stabilization using a given
event-triggering strategy. For small values of the delay, the timing
information carried by the triggering events is substantial, and the system can
be stabilized with any positive rate. When the delay exceeds a critical
threshold, the timing information alone is not enough to achieve stabilization
and the required rate grows. When the loss of information due to the
communication delay perfectly compensates the implicit information carried by
the triggering events, the delay equals the inverse of the entropy rate of the
plant, and we obtain the same rate requirement prescribed by the data-rate
theorem. When the delay is larger than this threshold, the required rate
becomes larger than that required by the data-rate theorem. We also provide an
explicit construction yielding a sufficient rate for stabilization, and
generalize our results to vector systems. The results do not rely on any a

the standard wisdom, the most stable structure of CO at ambient pressure was
found to be a polymeric structure of Pna21 symmetry rather than a molecular
solid. This phase is formed from six-membered (4 Carbon + 2 Oxygen) rings
connected by C=C double bonds with two double-bonded oxygen atoms attached to
each ring. Interestingly, the polymeric Pna21 phase of CO has a much higher
energy density than trinitrotoluene (TNT). On compression to about 7 GPa, Pna21
is found to transform into another chain-like phase of Cc symmetry which has
similar ring units to Pna21. On compression to 100 GPa it is energetically
favorable for CO to polymerize to form a single-bonded Cmcm phase from another
structure of Cmca symmetry composed of units similar to those found in the
single-bonded I212121 structure. Thermodynamic stability of these structures
was verified using calculations with different density functionals, including

for advanced Demand Side Management (DSM) technique that addresses the
scalability concerns of the system and stochastic availabilities of EVs.
Towards this goal, a stochastic DSM is proposed to capture the uncertainties in
EVs. Numerical approximation is then used to make the problem tractable. To
accelerate the computational speed, the proposed DSM is tightly relaxed to a
convex form using second-order cone programming. Furthermore, in light of the
continuous increasing problem size, a distributed method with a guaranteed
convergence is applied to shift the centralized computational burden to
distributed controllers. To verify the proposed DSM, real-life EV data
collected on UCLA campus is used to test the proposed DSM in an IEEE benchmark
test system. Numerical results demonstrate the correctness and merits of the
proposed approach.

relaxation function changes gradually from a single-step to a two-step form as
temperature declines through the stress relaxation of various metallic glasses

Such a two-step relaxation is unexpected in glassy state and reveals a
decoupling of dynamic modes arising from two different mechanisms: a faster one
exhibiting ballistic-like feature, and a slower one associated with a broader
distribution of relaxation times typical of subdiffusive atomic motion. This
first observation of two-step dynamics in metallic glassy state points to a far
richer-than-expected scenario for glass relaxation.

sophisticated frontal detection methodology, the Wavelet/Higher Order
Statistics Enhancement (WHOSE) method, introduced in \cite{Chapman2014}. This
methodology is applied to 21 years of daily gridded sea-surface height (SSH)
data to obtain daily maps of the locations of the fronts. By forming
`heat-maps' of the frontal occurrence frequency and then approximating these
heat-maps by a superposition of simple functions, the time-mean locations of
the fronts, as well as a measure of their capacity to meander, are obtained and
related to the frontal locations found by previous studies.
  The spatial and temporal variability of the frontal structure is then
considered. The number of fronts is found to be highly variable throughout the
Southern Ocean, increasing (`splitting') downstream of large bathymetric
features and decreasing (`merging') in regions where the fronts are tightly
controlled by the underlying topography. In contrast, frontal meandering
remains relatively constant. Contrary to many previous studies, little no
southward migration of the fronts over the 1993-2014 time period is found, and
there is only weak sensitivity to atmospheric forcing related to SAM or ENSO.
The reasons for the discrepancy between this study and previous studies using
contour methods are investigated and it is shown that the spatial variability
of the frontal structure is not tied to the underlying sea-surface height. It
is argued that the results of studies using sea-surface height contours to
define front must be interpreted with care.

device obtained from a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a magnetic field,
we numerically solve the coupled field-circuit equations to calculate the
expected performance of the circulator, as determined by the $S$ parameters of
the device when coupled to 50$\Omega$ ports, as a function of frequency and
magnetic field. Above magnetic fields of 1.5T, for which a typical 2DEG enters
the quantum Hall regime (corresponding to a Landau-level filling fraction $\nu$
of 20), the Hall angle $\theta_H=\tan^{-1}\sigma_{xy}/\sigma_{xx}$ always
remains close to $90^\circ$, and the $S$ parameters are close to the analytic
predictions of VD for $\theta_H=\pi/2$. As anticipated by VD, MEA find the
device to have rather high (k$\Omega$) impedance, and thus to be extremely
mismatched to $50\Omega$, requiring the use of impedance matching. We
incorporate the lumped matching circuits of MEA in our modeling and confirm
that they can produce excellent circulation, although confined to a very small
bandwidth. We predict that this bandwidth is significantly improved by working
at lower magnetic field when the Landau index is high, e.g. $\nu=20$, and the
impedance mismatch is correspondingly less extreme. Our modeling also confirms
the observation of MEA that parasitic port-to-port capacitance can produce very
interesting countercirculation effects.

fundamental challenges in physics today. Cosmography provides information about
the evolution of the universe derived from measured distances, assuming only
that the space time ge- ometry is described by the
Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric, and adopting an approach that
effectively uses only Taylor expansions of basic observables. Aims. We perform
a high-redshift analysis to constrain the cosmographic expansion up to the
fifth order. It is based on the Union2 type Ia supernovae data set, the
gamma-ray burst Hubble diagram, a data set of 28 independent measurements of
the Hubble param- eter, baryon acoustic oscillations measurements from galaxy
clustering and the Lyman-{\alpha} forest in the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), and some Gaussian priors on h and {\Omega}M .
Methods. We performed a statistical analysis and explored the probability
distributions of the cosmographic parameters. By building up their regions of
confidence, we maximized our likelihood function using the Markov chain Monte
Carlo method. Results. Our high-redshift analysis confirms that the expansion
of the Universe currently accelerates; the estimation of the jerk parameter
indicates a possible deviation from the standard {\Lambda}CDM cosmological
model. Moreover, we investigate implications of our results for the
reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state (EOS) by comparing the
standard technique of cosmography with an alternative approach based on
generalized Pad\'e approximations of the same observables. Because these
expansions converge better, is possible to improve the constraints on the
cosmographic parameters and also on the dark matter EOS. Conclusions. The
estimation of the jerk and the DE parameters indicates at 1{\sigma} a possible
deviation from the {\Lambda}CDM cosmological model.

wall through the emission of sound waves, causing a slight increase in the
soliton's speed. We characterise this energy loss as a function of the wall
parameters. Moreover, over multiple oscillations and reflections in the
box-like trap, the energy loss and speed increase of the soliton can be
significant, although the decay eventually becomes stabilized when the soliton

equation is a fully nonlinear PDE, with a source term that is a function of the
gradient of the solution. This nonlinear source term is an additional
computational challenge that has received little attention from MA applications
in other fields. There are two major components needed to find a solution to
the MA equation: a spatial discretisation and an algorithm to find a solution
of the resulting nonlinear algebraic equations. There have been a number of
different approaches proposed in the literature to solve the MA equation but
none of which perform consistent comparisons across both algorithmic and
discretisation differences. In this study we explore different algorithmic
methods for the MA equation all within the context of a finite volume spatial
discretisation. We introduce a new linearisation of the MA equation that
neglects the nonlinearities arising from the source term and show that it leads
to a method that is fast, robust and free of tuning parameters. We present
numerical experiments that show methods based on this linearisation of the MA
equation are more computationally efficient than those that rely on other
techniques such as a parabolic relaxation. Further, the equations resulting
from a full linearisation of the MA equation, equivalent to using Newton's
method, can be seen as analogous to an advection-diffusion equation. This
allows many tools that exist for computational fluid dynamics to be re-factored
easily to solve the MA equation. The robustness and efficiency of the newly
introduced method gives hope that an adaptive solver for geophysical flows
using mesh redistribution can be computationally feasible in the near future.

observe 2 OH/IR stars and 4 carbon stars in the LMC in the CO J= 2-1 line.
Results: We present the first measurement of expansion velocities in
extragalactic carbon stars. All four C-stars are detected and wind expansion
velocities and stellar velocities are directly measured. Mass-loss rates are
derived from modelling the spectral energy distribution and Spitzer/IRS
spectrum with the DUSTY code. Gas-to-dust ratios are derived that make the
predicted velocities agree with the observed ones. The expansion velocities and
MLRs are compared to a Galactic sample of well-studied relatively low MLRs
stars supplemented with ""extreme"" C-stars that have properties more similar to
the LMC targets. Gas MLRs derived from a simple formula are significantly
smaller than derived from the dust modelling, indicating an order of magnitude
underestimate of the estimated CO abundance, time-variable mass loss, or that
the CO intensities in LMC stars are lower than predicted by the formula derived
for Galactic objects. This could be related to a stronger interstellar
radiation field in the LMC. Conclusions: Although the LMC sample is small and
the comparison to Galactic stars is non-trivial because of uncertainties in
their distances it appears that for C stars the wind expansion velocities in
the LMC are lower than in the solar neighbourhood, while the MLRs appear
similar. This is in agreement with dynamical dust-driven wind models.

significantly more extended and disturbed, and suggesting that major mergers
may be responsible for driving the formation of the compact dust disks we
observe. The stark contrast between the obscured and unobscured morphologies
may also have implications for SED fitting routines that assume the dust is
co-located with the optical/near-IR continuum emission. Finally, we discuss the
potential of the current bursts of star formation to transform the observed
galaxy sizes and light profiles, showing that the $z\sim0$ descendants of these
SMGs are expected to have stellar masses, effective radii, and gas surface
densities consistent with the most compact massive (M_* ~ 1-2 x 10^11 M_sun)
early-type galaxies observed locally.

demonstrate that a current modulation introduces a temporally evolving
parameter landscape allowing to control the position and the dynamics of LSs.
We show that the localized pulses drifting speed in this landscape depends
almost exclusively on the local parameter value instead of depending on the
landscape gradient, as shown in quasi-instantaneous media. This experimental
observation is theoretically explained by the causal response time of the
semiconductor carriers that occurs on an finite timescale and breaks the parity
invariance along the cavity, thus leading to a new paradigm for temporal
tweezing of localized pulses. Different modulation waveforms are applied for

via a double reflection by usual grazing-incidence geometries such as the
Wolter-I, stray rays coming from off-axis sources are reflected only once by
either the parabolic or the hyperbolic segment. Although not focused, stray
light may represent a major source of background and ghost images especially
when observing a field of faint sources in the vicinities of another, more
intense, just outside the field of view of the telescope. The stray light
problem is faced by mounting a pre-collimator in front of the mirror module, in
order to shade a part of the reflective surfaces that may give rise to
singly-reflected rays. Studying the expected stray light impact, and
consequently designing a pre-collimator, is a typical ray-tracing problem,
usually time and computation consuming, especially if we consider that rays
propagate throughout a densely nested structure. This in turn requires one to
pay attention to all the possible obstructions, increasing the complexity of
the simulation. In contrast, approaching the problems of stray light
calculation from an analytical viewpoint largely simplifies the problem, and
may also ease the task of designing an effective pre-collimator. In this work
we expose an analytical formalism that can be used to compute the stray light
in a nested optical module in a fast and effective way, accounting for
obstruction effects.

possess relatively simple structure thus used as a benchmark to promote further
research. With identifiability of the network guaranteed, this paper presents
an identification method that infers both the Boolean structure of the network
and the internal dynamics between nodes. Identification is performed directly
from data without any prior knowledge of the system, including its order. The
proposed method solves the identification problem using Maximum a posteriori
estimation (MAP) but with inseparable penalties for complexity, both in terms
of element (order of nonzero connections) and group sparsity (network
topology). Such an approach is widely applied in Compressive Sensing (CS) and
known as Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL). We then propose a novel scheme that
combines sparse Bayesian and group sparse Bayesian to efficiently solve the
problem. The resulted algorithm has a similar form of the standard Sparse Group
Lasso (SGL) while with known noise variance, it simplifies to exact re-weighted
SGL. The method and the developed toolbox can be applied to infer networks from
a wide range of fields, including systems biology applications such as

field of machine learning, particularly due to their high accuracy in visual
recognition. Recent works have pushed the performance of GPU implementations of
CNNs to significantly improve their classification and training times. With
these improvements, many frameworks have become available for implementing CNNs
on both CPUs and GPUs, with no support for FPGA implementations. In this work
we present a modified version of the popular CNN framework Caffe, with FPGA
support. This allows for classification using CNN models and specialized FPGA
implementations with the flexibility of reprogramming the device when
necessary, seamless memory transactions between host and device, simple-to-use
test benches, and the ability to create pipelined layer implementations. To
validate the framework, we use the Xilinx SDAccel environment to implement an
FPGA-based Winograd convolution engine and show that the FPGA layer can be used
alongside other layers running on a host processor to run several popular CNNs
(AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGG A, Overfeat). The results show that our framework
achieves 50 GFLOPS across 3x3 convolutions in the benchmarks. This is achieved
within a practical framework, which will aid in future development of
FPGA-based CNNs.

graph by a train track splitting sequence on a surface, up to multiplicative
and additive constants. If some moderate assumptions on a splitting sequence
are satisfied, each vertex set of a train track in it will represent a vertex
of a graph which is naturally quasi-isometric to the pants graph; moreover the
splitting sequence gives an edge-path in this graph so, more precisely, our
distance estimate holds between the extreme points of this path. The present
distance estimate is inspired by a result of Masur, Mosher and Schleimer for
distances in the marking graph. However, we can apply their line of proof only
after some manipulation of the splitting sequence: a rearrangement, changing
the order the elementary moves are performed in, so that the ones producing
Dehn twists are brought together; and then an untwisting, which suppresses the
majority of these latter moves to give a new sequence, which does not end with
the same track as before, but does not include any portion that is almost
stationary in the pants graph. The required distance is then, up to constants,
the number of splits occurring in the untwisted sequence. A consequence of our
main theorem together with a result of Brock is that, given a pseudo-Anosov
self-diffeomorphism $\psi$ of a surface $S$, the maximal splitting sequence
introduced by Agol gives us an estimate for the hyperbolic volume of the
mapping torus built from $S$ and $\psi$. There are also some interesting
consequences for the hyperbolic volume of a solid torus minus a closed braid,
via a machinery employed by Dynnikov and Wiest.

Bloch equations. Expressed in this form the resulting Liouvillian matrix is
analyzed in detail. As it turns out, most of the findings of open STIRAP models
can be understood from the spectrum and eigenstates of the Liouvillian matrix.
As a non-hermitian matrix we particularly discuss the mathematical structure of
it by identifying among others the physical meaning of its eigenvectors and the
system's exceptional points. We also discuss the importance of the Liouvillian
gap which normally implies that any state becomes mixed. However, in certain
situations, for example the STIRAP model under influence of spontaneous
emission, a sort of pump term appears in the equations of motion, and its
effect is to counteract the gap induced decay such that coherence may prevail.
As the STIRAP driving is not perfectly adiabatic, we additionally find that for
spontaneous emission the presence of a non-zero Liouvillian gap actually
enhances the success rate of the process. This is thus an example of a
environment assisted physical operation.

an in-situ, at-wavelength quality control of the optical modules produced in

angular resolution, and, in the case of SPOs, there is also the interesting
possibility to align the parabolic and the hyperbolic stacks directly under
X-rays, to minimize the aberrations. However, a parallel beam with divergence
below 2 arcsec is necessary in order to measure mirror elements that are
expected to reach an angular resolution of about 4 arcsec, since the ATHENA

considered in order to alleviate the impact of the data tsunami on both the
access and backhaul networks. A number of interesting techniques have been
proposed, including femto-caching and ""delayed"" or opportunistic cache access.
Nevertheless, the majority of these approaches suffer from the rather limited
storage capacity of the edge caches, compared to the tremendous and rapidly
increasing size of the Internet content catalog. We propose to depart from the
assumption of hard cache misses, common in most existing works, and consider
""soft"" cache misses, where if the original content is not available, an
alternative content that is locally cached can be recommended. Given that
Internet content consumption is increasingly entertainment-oriented, we believe
that a related content could often lead to complete or at least partial user
satisfaction, without the need to retrieve the original content over expensive
links. In this paper, we formulate the problem of optimal edge caching with
soft cache hits, in the context of delayed access, and analyze the expected
gains. We then show using synthetic and real datasets of related video contents
that promising caching gains could be achieved in practice.

by surface states spin-splitted by spin-orbit coupling. Using the Rashba model,
the tensor of exchange interactions is extracted wherein a pseudo-dipolar
interaction is found besides the usual isotropic exchange interaction and the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We find that, despite the latter
interaction, collinear magnetic states can still be stabilized by the
pseudo-dipolar interaction. The inter-adatom distance controls the strength of
these terms, which we exploit to design chiral magnetism in Fe nanostructures
deposited on Au(111) surface. We demonstrate that these magnetic interactions
are related to superpositions of the out-of-plane and in-plane components of
the skyrmionic magnetic waves induced by the adatoms in the surrounding
electron gas. We show that, even if the inter-atomic distance is large, the
size and shape of the nanostructures dramatically impacts on the strength of
the magnetic interactions, thereby affecting the magnetic ground state. We also
derive an appealing connection between the isotropic exchange interaction and
the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which relates the latter to the first
order change of the former with respect to the spin-orbit coupling. This
implies that the chirality defined by the direction of the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vector is driven by the variation of the isotropic
exchange interaction due to the spin-orbit interaction.

potentials and large surface charge densities, the Debye-Hueckel approximation

from the nonlinear Poisson--Boltzmann equation is smaller than the
Debye-Hueckel result, such that the required critical surface charge density
for polyelectrolyte adsorption $\sigma_c$ increases. The nonlinear relation
between the surface charge density and electrostatic potential leads to a
sharply increasing critical surface charge density with growing ionic strength,
imposing an additional limit to the critical salt concentration above which no
polyelectrolyte adsorption occurs at all. We contrast our simulations findings

which promote the clustering of scattered multipath waves. Unfortunately, many
of the conventional fading models adopted in the literature to develop network
models lack the flexibility to account for such disparate signal propagation
mechanisms. To bridge the gap between theory and practical channels, we
consider $\kappa$-$\mu$ shadowed fading, which contains as special cases, the
majority of the linear fading models proposed in the open literature, including
Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami-m, Nakagami-q, One-sided Gaussian, $\kappa$-$\mu$,
$\eta$-$\mu$, and Rician shadowed to name but a few. In particular, we apply an
orthogonal expansion to represent the $\kappa$-$\mu$ shadowed fading
distribution as a simplified series expression. Then using the series
expressions with stochastic geometry, we propose an analytic framework to
evaluate the average of an arbitrary function of the SINR over $\kappa$-$\mu$
shadowed fading channels. Using the proposed method, we evaluate the spectral
efficiency, moments of the SINR, bit error probability and outage probability
of a $K$-tier HetNet with $K$ classes of BSs, differing in terms of the
transmit power, BS density, shadowing characteristics and small-scale fading.
Building upon these results, we provide important new insights into the network

fractals for arbitrary fractal iteration, which enables various approximations
for the scattering intensity. It is shown that for the Cantor fractal, one can
neglect with a good accuracy the correlations between the mass fractal
amplitudes, while for the Koch snowflake, these correlations are important. It
is shown that nevertheless, the correlations can be build in the mass fractal
amplitudes, which explains the decay of the scattering intensity $I(q)\sim

of the perimeter. The curve $I(q)q^{4-D_{\mathrm{s}}}$ is found to be
log-periodic in the fractal region with the period equal to the scaling factor
of the fractal. The log-periodicity arises from the self-similarity of sizes of
basic structural units rather than from correlations between their distances. A
recurrence relation is obtained for the radius of gyration of Koch snowflake,

allows us to obtain additional information from SAS data, such as the edges of

to check definitional equality of terms while type checking gives rise to a
tight interplay between type checking and unification. This interplay is a
major source of complexity in the type-checking algorithm for existing
dependently typed programming languages. We propose an algorithm that encodes a
type-checking problem entirely in the form of unification constraints, reducing
the complexity of the type-checking code by taking advantage of higher order
unification, which is already part of the implementation of many dependently
typed languages.

individual cells can usually be considered as simple, three-dimensional
polyhedra. This paper is concerned with determining the distribution of
combinatorial types of such polyhedral cells. We introduce the terms
\emph{fundamental} and \emph{vertex-truncated} types and apply these concepts
to the grain growth microstructure as a testing ground. For these
microstructures we demonstrate that most grains are of particular fundamental
types, whereas the frequency of vertex-truncated types decreases exponentially
with the number of truncations. This can be explained by the evolutionary
process through which grain growth structures are formed, and in which
energetically unfavorable surfaces are quickly eliminated. Furthermore, we
observe that these grain types are `round' in a combinatorial sense: there are
no `short' separating cycles that partition the polyhedra into two parts of
similar sizes. A particular microstructure derived from the Poisson--Voronoi
initial condition is identified as containing an unusually large proportion of
round grains. This Round microstructure has an average of $14.036$ faces per

like to have two CNNs, one for RGB and one for depth, each trained on a
suitable data collection, able to capture the perceptual properties of each

lack of a suitable depth database. This paper addresses this issue, proposing
to opt for synthetically generated images rather than collecting by hand a 2.5D
large scale database. While being clearly a proxy for real data, synthetic
images allow to trade quality for quantity, making it possible to generate a
virtually infinite amount of data. We show that the filters learned from such

better characterize the different facets of depth images, and (b) complementary

mechanism of energy transfer from global transverse MHD waves to local
azimuthal Alfv\'en waves. Due to its localised nature, a direct detection of
this mechanism is extremely difficult. Yet, it is the leading theory explaining
the observed fast damping of the global transverse waves. However, at odds with
this theoretical prediction, recent observations indicate that in the low
amplitude regime such transverse MHD waves can also appear decay-less, a yet
unsolved phenomenon. Recent numerical work has shown that Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities (KHI) often accompany transverse MHD waves. In this work, we
combine 3D MHD simulations and forward modelling to show that for currently
achieved spatial resolution and observed small amplitudes, an apparent
decay-less oscillation is obtained. This effect results from the combination of
periodic brightenings produced by the KHI and the coherent motion of the KHI
vortices amplified by resonant absorption. Such effect is especially clear in
emission lines forming at temperatures that capture the boundary dynamics
rather than the core, and reflects the low damping character of the local
azimuthal Alfv\'en waves resonantly coupled to the kink mode. Due to phase
mixing, the detected period can vary depending on the emission line, with those
sensitive to the boundary having shorter periods than those sensitive to the
loop core. This allows to estimate the density contrast at the boundary.

Technically, BCS is a reachability problem that is known to be NP-complete. Our
contribution is a parameterized analysis of BCS.
  The first result is an algorithm that solves BCS when parameterized by the
number of context switches (cs) and the size of the memory (m) in
O*(m^(cs)2^(cs)). This is achieved by creating instances of the easier problem
Shuff which we solve via fast subset convolution. We also present a lower bound

hypothesis. Interestingly, closing the gap means settling a conjecture that has
been open since FOCS'07. Further, we prove that BCS admits no polynomial
kernel.
  Next, we introduce a measure, called scheduling dimension, that captures the
complexity of schedules. We study BCS parameterized by the scheduling dimension
(sdim) and show that it can be solved in O*((2m)^(4sdim)4^t)$, where t is the

quantum computation; the ability to identify the quality of their internal
correlations will play a crucial role in addressing the buiding stage of such
states. We introduce a novel diagnostic scheme for multipartite networks of
entangled particles, aimed at assessing the quality of the gates used for the
engineering of their state. Using the information gathered from a set of
suitably chosen multiparticle Bell tests, we identify conditions bounding the
quality of the entangled bonds among the elements of a register. We demonstrate
the effectiveness, flexibility, and diagnostic power of the proposed
methodology by characterizing a quantum resource engineered combining
two-photon hyperentanglement and photonic-chip technology. Our approach is
feasible for medium-sized networks due to the intrinsically modular nature of
cluster states, and paves the way to section-by-section analysis of large
photonics resources.

(2015), Drake et al. (2015) have shown that the heliospheric
magnetic field results in formation of two-jet structure of the solar wind flow
in the inner heliosheath, i.e. in the subsonic region between the heliospheric
termination shock and the heliopause. In this scenario the heliopause has a
tube-like topology as compared with a sheet-like topology in the most models of
the global heliosphere (e.g. Izmodenov and Alexashov, 2015). In this paper we
explore the two-jet scenario for a simplified astrosphere in which 1) the star
is at rest with respect to the circumstellar medium, 2) radial magnetic field
is neglected as compared with azimuthal component, 3) the stellar wind outflow
is assumed to be hypersonic (both the Mach number and the Alfv\'enic Mach
number are much greater than unity at the inflow boundary). We have shown that
the problem can be formulated in dimensionless form, in which the solution
depends only on one dimensionless parameter epsilon that is reciprocal of the
Alfv\'enic Mach number at the inflow boundary. This parameter is proportional
to stellar magnetic field. We present the numerical solution of the problem for
various values of epsilon. Three first integrals of the governing ideal MHD
equations are presented, and we make use of them in order to get the plasma
distribution in the jets. Simple relations between distances to the termination
shock, astropause and the size of the jet are established. These relations
allow us to determine the stellar magnetic field from the geometrical pattern
of the jet-like astrosphere.

simulated signal and background data in a generic 200 kg HPXe-TPC, based on two

the search for the longest path. Rejection factors greater than 100 are
obtained for small pixel sizes and a signal efficiency of 40%. Moreover, a new

theory (de las Heras and Schmidt 2013 Soft Matter 9 8636) establishes a unique
connection between the bulk phase behaviour and
sedimentation-diffusion-equilibrium. The theory constructs a stacking diagram
of all possible sequences of stacks under gravity in the limit of very high
(infinite) sample heights. Here, we study the stacking diagrams of colloidal
mixtures at finite sample height, h. We demonstrate that h plays a vital role
in sedimentation-diffusion-equilibrium of colloidal mixtures. The region of the
stacking diagram occupied by a given sequence of stacks depends on h. Hence,
two samples with different heights but identical colloidal concentrations can
develop different stacking sequences. In addition, the stacking diagrams for
different heights can be qualitatively different since some stacking sequences
occur only in a given interval of sample heights. We use the theory to
investigate the stacking diagrams of both model bulk systems and mixtures of
patchy particles that differ either by the number or by the types of patches.

pseudospin $S=1$ Dirac cones emerge at the $\Gamma$ and $H$ points of the bcc

At the $S=1$ Dirac points, the spin-orbit coupling lifts the energy level with
sixfold degeneracy into two energy levels with two-dimensional $\bar E_2$ and
four-dimensional $\bar F$ representations. Remarkably, all the dispersions near
the $\bar F$ point show the linear dependence in the momentum with different

precise values for T$_{\rm eff}$ for the secondaries in the shortest period

in CVs have sub-solar metallicities. We confirm carbon deficits for a large

phase-resolved spectra to ascertain the mass and radius of the donor in U Gem.
The secondary star in U Gem appears to have a lower {\it apparent} gravity than
a main sequence star of its spectral type. Applying this result to other CVs,
we find that the later-than-expected spectral types observed for many CV donors

excesses of sodium, and extreme deficits of carbon. Synthetic spectra that have
a reduced abundance of hydrogen are best able to explain the spectra of these

Conversations are simulated using speech from two speakers, each with a
different background noise, with varied SNR values, down to -10 dB. Ten each of

that the requirement of a dilepton pair combined with two high $p_{T}$ forward

times ($T_{1e}$ and $T_{1N}$) were measured within the temperature range
0.15-2.5$\,$K in a magnetic field of 4.6 T, conditions which ensure a high
polarization of electron spins. We found that $T_{1e}$ is nearly temperature
independent in this temperature range, while $T_{1N}$ decreased by 2 orders of
magnitude. Such strong temperature dependence is typical for the nuclear Orbach
mechanism of relaxation via the electron spins. We found that the nuclear spins
of H atoms in solid D$_{2}$ and D$_{2}:$HD can be efficiently polarized by the
Overhauser effect. Pumping the forbidden transitions of H atoms also leads to
DNP, with the efficiency strongly dependent on the concentration of D atoms.
This behaviour indicates the Cross effect mechanism of the DNP and nuclear
relaxation, which turns out to be well resolved in the conditions of our
experiments. Efficient DNP of H atoms was also observed when pumping the middle
D line located in center of the ESR spectrum. This phenomenon can be explained
in terms of clusters or pairs of H atoms with strong exchange interaction.
These clusters have partially allowed transitions in the center of the ESR
spectrum and DNP may be created via the resolved Cross effect.

electrokinetic phenomena in porous networks over a wide range of applications
including energy conversion, desalination, and lab-on-a-chip systems. Coupling
between fluid flow and ion transport in these networks is governed by the
Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Stokes equations. These equations describe a wide range
of transport phenomena that can interact in complex and highly nonlinear ways
in networks involving multiple pores with variable properties. Capturing these
phenomena by direct simulation of the governing equations in multiple
dimensions is prohibitively expensive. We present here a reduced order
computational model that treats a network of many pores via solutions to 1D
equations. Assuming that each pore in the network is long and thin, we derive a
1D model describing the transport in pore's longitudinal direction. We take
into account the non-uniformity of potential and ion concentration profiles
across the pore cross-section in the form of area-averaged coefficients in
different flux terms representing fluid flow, electric current, and ion fluxes.
Distinct advantages of the present framework include: a fully conservative
discretization, fully bounded tabulated area-averaged coefficients without any
singularity in the limit of infinitely thick electric double layers (EDLs), a
flux discretization that exactly preserves equilibrium conditions, and
extension to general network of pores with multiple intersections. By
considering a hierarchy of canonical problems with increasing complexity, we
demonstrate that the developed framework can capture a wide range of phenomena.
Example demonstrations include, prediction of osmotic pressure built up in thin
pores subject to concentration gradient, propagation of deionization shocks and
induced recirculations for intersecting pores with varying properties.

element mesh, without the need for face splitting or the use of enrichment
techniques. A monolithic solution strategy is adopted, solving simultaneously

as a continuous process, together with face flipping, node merging and edge

detector response and backgrounds, and will provide better sensitivity for dark
matter particle masses (> 5 GeV/c$^2$). The mix of detector types (HV and
iZIP), and targets (germanium and silicon), planned for the experiment, as well
as flexibility in how the detectors are operated, will allow us to maximize the
low-mass reach, and understand the backgrounds that the experiment will
encounter. Upgrades to the experiment, perhaps with a variety of
ultra-low-background cryogenic detectors, will extend dark matter sensitivity
down to the ""neutrino floor"", where coherent scatters of solar neutrinos become
a limiting background.

character-level language modeling (LM). The system also employs a statistical
word-level LM to improve the recognition accuracy. The results of the AM, the

The RNNs are implemented using massively parallel processing elements (PEs) for
low latency and high throughput. The weights are quantized to 6 bits to store
all of them in the on-chip memory of an FPGA. The proposed algorithm is
implemented on a Xilinx XC7Z045, and the system can operate much faster than

widely recruited to provide means for further understanding of pertinent
biological phenomena. However, despite the vast amounts of new evidence
compiled by medical doctors, there are still many aspects of tumor growth that
remain largely unknown. There is still a large variety of mechanisms to be
better understood and therefore, many hypotheses to be tested. To approach this
problem, starting from mathematical elaborations, we have developed a model of
the early phases of tumor growth consisting of several algorithmic modules,
each one corresponding to a particular biological mechanism. The modularity of
the model allows keeping track of the assumptions made in each step and
facilitates re-adjustment, in case new hypotheses need to be considered.
Simulations showed good qualitative agreement with biological observations, and
revealed a non-trivial interplay between between oxygen requirements of cancer

stars (NSs) receive a significant velocity kick at birth. Such natal kicks are
considered to play an important role in the the evolution of binary-NS systems.
The kick given to the NS (together with the effect of mass loss due to the
supernova explosion of the NS progenitor) may result in the binary disruption
or lead to a significant change of the binary orbital properties. Here we
explore in detail the dynamical aftermath of natal kicks in binary systems,
determine their possible outcomes and characterize their relative frequency,
making use of analytic arguments and detailed population synthesis models. In a
fraction of the cases the kick may cast the NS in such a trajectory as to
collide with the binary companion, or pass sufficiently close to it as to
disrupt it (micro tidal disruption event; $\mu$TDE), or alternatively it could
be tidally-captured into a close orbit, eventually forming an X-ray binary. We
calculate the rates of direct post-kick physical collisions and the possible
potential production of Thorne-Zytkow objects or long-GRBs through this
process, estimate the rates X-ray binaries formation and determine the rates of
$\mu$TDEs and faint supernovae from white dwarf disruptions by NSs. Finally we
suggest that natal kicks can produce BH-NS binaries with very short
gravitational-wave merger time, possibly giving rise to a new type of promptly

binary-merger GW sources with a unique (likely type Ib/c) supernova

elusive for many voltage gated ion channels, such as eukaryotic sodium ones.
The understanding of channel functions is a pressing issue in molecular

membrane channel charge transport have become an emergent field and give rise
to significant contributions to our understanding of ion channel gating and
function. This review summarizes recent progresses and outlines remaining
challenges in mathematical modeling, simulation and analysis of ion channel
charge transport. One of our focuses is the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) model
and its generalizations. Specifically, the basic framework of the PNP system
and some of its extensions, including size effects, ion-water interactions,
coupling with density functional theory and relation to fluid flow models. A
reduced theory, the Poisson- Boltzmann-Nernst-Planck (PBNP) model, and a
differential geometry based ion transport model are also discussed. For proton
channel, a multiscale and multiphysics Poisson-Boltzmann-Kohn-Sham (PBKS) model
is presented. We show that all of these ion channel models can be cast into a

the solvent and a microscopic discrete domain of the solute. The main strategy
is to construct a total energy functional of a charge transport system to
encompass the polar and nonpolar free energies of solvation and chemical
potential related energies. Current computational algorithms and tools for

multiplexing of reconfigurable hardware resources raises a number of new
issues, ranging from run-time systems to complex programming models that
usually form a Reconfigurable hardware Operating System (ROS). The Operating
System performs online task scheduling and handles resource management. There
are many challenges in adaptive computing and dynamic reconfigurable systems.
One of the major understudied challenges is estimating the required resources
in terms of soft cores, Programmable Reconfigurable Regions (PRRs), the
appropriate communication infrastructure, and to predict a near optimal layout
and floorplan of the reconfigurable logic fabric. Some of these issues are
specific to the application being designed, while others are more general and
relate to the underlying run-time environment. Static resource allocation for
Run- Time Reconfiguration (RTR) often leads to inferior and unacceptable

necessary resources for an application based on past historical information. An
important feature of the proposed methodology is that the system is able to
learn and generalize and, therefore, is expected to improve its accuracy over
time. The goal of the entire process is to extract useful hidden knowledge from
the data. This knowledge is the prediction and estimation of the necessary
resources for an unknown or not previously seen application.

  Predicting Audience Preferences","Presented at the Data For Good Exchange 2016",,,,"stat.AP cs.DB cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Performing arts organizations aim to enrich their communities through the
arts. To do this, they strive to match their performance offerings to the taste
of those communities. Success relies on understanding audience preference and
predicting their behavior. Similar to most e-commerce or digital entertainment
firms, arts presenters need to recommend the right performance to the right
customer at the right time. As part of the Michigan Data Science Team (MDST),
we partnered with the University Musical Society (UMS), a non-profit performing
arts presenter housed in the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. We are
providing UMS with analysis and business intelligence, utilizing historical
individual-level sales data. We built a recommendation system based on
collaborative filtering, gaining insights into the artistic preferences of
customers, along with the similarities between performances. To better
understand audience behavior, we used statistical methods from customer-base
analysis. We characterized customer heterogeneity via segmentation, and we
modeled customer cohorts to understand and predict ticket purchasing patterns.
Finally, we combined statistical modeling with natural language processing
(NLP) to explore the impact of wording in program descriptions. These ongoing
efforts provide a platform to launch targeted marketing campaigns, helping UMS
carry out its mission by allocating its resources more efficiently. Celebrating
its 138th season, UMS is a 2014 recipient of the National Medal of Arts, and it
continues to enrich communities by connecting world-renowned artists with
diverse audiences, especially students in their formative years. We aim to
contribute to that mission through data science and customer analytics.

being implemented in many industries globally. In this work, the MO
optimization of the extraction process of bioactive compounds from the Gardenia
Jasminoides Ellis fruit was solved. Three swarm-based algorithms have been
applied in conjunction with normal-boundary intersection (NBI) method to solve
this MO problem. The gravitational search algorithm (GSA) and the particle
swarm optimization (PSO) technique were implemented in this work. In addition,
a novel Hopfield-enhanced particle swarm optimization was developed and applied
to the extraction problem. By measuring the levels of dominance, the optimality
of the approximate Pareto frontiers produced by all the algorithms were gauged
and compared. Besides, by measuring the levels of convergence of the frontier,
some understanding regarding the structure of the objective space in terms of
its relation to the level of frontier dominance is uncovered. Detail
comparative studies were conducted on all the algorithms employed and developed
in this work.
