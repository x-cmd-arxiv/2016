nine sub-samples with equal range in $(B-V)_0$ colour, $\Delta(B-V)_0=0.05$

provide [$\alpha$/Fe] elements in the range [0.0, 0.4]. We applied the
procedure to two sets of field stars and two sets of clusters. The mean and the
corresponding standard deviation of the residuals for 43 field stars taken from
the Hypatia catalogue are [$\alpha$/Fe]=-0.090 and $\sigma =0.102$ dex, while
for the 39 ones taken from the same catalogue of stars used in the calibration
are [$\alpha$/Fe]=-0.009 and $\sigma = 0.079$ dex, respectively. We showed that
the differences between the mean of the residuals and standard deviations for
two sets of clusters ([$\alpha$/Fe]=0.073 and $\sigma = 0.91$ dex;
[$\alpha$/Fe]=-0.012 and $\sigma = 0.053$ dex) originate from the $(B-V)_0$ and
$(U-B)_0$ colour indices of the clusters which are taken from different
sources. The differences between the original [$\alpha$/Fe] elements and the
estimated ones (the residuals) are compatible with the uncertainties in the
literature. Also, there is a good agreement between the distribution of the
synthetic alpha elements versus ultra-violet excesses and the ones obtained via
our calibrations.

iPhone 5c passcode retry counter under iOS 9. This was achieved by desoldering
the NAND Flash chip of a sample phone in order to physically access its
connection to the SoC and partially reverse engineering its proprietary bus
protocol. The process does not require any expensive and sophisticated
equipment. All needed parts are low cost and were obtained from local
electronics distributors. By using the described and successful hardware
mirroring process it was possible to bypass the limit on passcode retry
attempts. This is the first public demonstration of the working prototype and
the real hardware mirroring process for iPhone 5c. Although the process can be
improved, it is still a successful proof-of-concept project. Knowledge of the
possibility of mirroring will definitely help in designing systems with better
protection. Also some reliability issues related to the NAND memory allocation
in iPhone 5c are revealed. Some future research directions are outlined in this
paper and several possible countermeasures are suggested. We show that claims
that iPhone 5c NAND mirroring was infeasible were ill-advised.

Strategic Program. This new satellite, Virgo I, which is located in the
constellation of Virgo, has been identified as a statistically significant (5.5
sigma) spatial overdensity of star-like objects with a well-defined main
sequence and red giant branch in their color-magnitude diagram. The
significance of this overdensity increases to 10.8 sigma when the relevant
isochrone filter is adopted for the search. Based on the distribution of the
stars around the likely main sequence turn-off at r ~ 24 mag, the distance to
Virgo I is estimated as 87 kpc, and its most likely absolute magnitude
calculated from a Monte Carlo analysis is M_V = -0.8 +/- 0.9 mag. This stellar
system has an extended spatial distribution with a half-light radius of 38
+12/-11 pc, which clearly distinguishes it from a globular cluster with
comparable luminosity. Thus, Virgo I is one of the faintest dwarf satellites

demonstrates the power of this survey program to identify very faint dwarf
satellites. This discovery of VirgoI is based only on about 100 square degrees
of data, thus a large number of faint dwarf satellites are likely to exist in

pattern classification. In a dynamic world, an object may continuously evolve
over time, and so does the graph extracted from the underlying object. These
changes in graph structure with respect to the temporal order present a new
representation of the graph, in which an object corresponds to a set of
time-variant graphs. In this paper, we formulate a novel time-variant graph
classification task and propose a new graph feature, called a graph-shapelet
pattern, for learning and classifying time-variant graphs. Graph-shapelet
patterns are compact and discriminative graph transformation subsequences. A
graph-shapelet pattern can be regarded as a graphical extension of a shapelet
-- a class of discriminative features designed for vector-based temporal data
classification. To discover graph-shapelet patterns, we propose to convert a
time-variant graph sequence into time-series data and use the discovered
shapelets to find graph transformation subsequences as graph-shapelet patterns.
By converting each graph-shapelet pattern into a unique tokenized graph
transformation sequence, we can measure the similarity between two
graph-shapelet patterns and therefore classify time-variant graphs. Experiments
on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the superior performance of
the proposed algorithms.

techinque and, then, the virial properties were estimated for each group. The
sample was divided into two stacked systems: low($z\leq0.6$) and high($z>0.6$)
redshift groups. Assuming that the color index ${(U-B)_0}$ can be used as a
proxy for the galaxy type, we found that the fraction of blue (star-forming)
objects is higher in the high-z sample, with blue objects being dominant at
$M_{B}>-19.5$ for both samples, and red objects being dominant at $M_{B}<-19.5$
only for the low-z sample. Also, the radial variation of the red fraction
indicates that there are more red objects with $R<R_{200}$ in the low-z sample
than in the high-z sample. Our analysis indicates statistical evidence of
kinematic segregation, at the 99%c.l., for the low-z sample: redder and
brighter galaxies present lower velocity dispersions than bluer and fainter
ones. We also find a weaker evidence for spatial segregation between red and
blue objects, at the 70%c.l. The analysis of the high-z sample reveals a
different result: red and blue galaxies have velocity dispersion distributions
not statistically distinct, although redder objects are more concentrated than
the bluer ones at the 95%c.l. From the comparison of blue/red and bright/faint
fractions, and considering the approximate lookback timescale between the two
samples ($\sim$3 Gyr), our results are consistent with a scenario where bright
red galaxies had time to reach energy equipartition, while faint blue/red
galaxies in the outskirts infall to the inner parts of the groups, thus
reducing spatial segregation from $z\sim0.8$ to $z\sim0.4$.

functions of the wave amplitude and the wave gradient. This family contains all
of the known breaking wave equations, including the integrable ones:
Camassa-Holm equation, Degasperis-Procesi equation, Novikov equation, and
FORQ/modified Camassa-Holm equation. One main result is to show that all of the
equations in the general family possess weak solutions given by multi-peakons
which are a linear superposition of peakons with time-dependent amplitudes and
positions. In particular, neither an integrability structure nor a Hamiltonian
structure is needed to derive $N$-peakon weak solutions for arbitrary $N>1$. As
a further result, single peakon travelling-wave solutions are shown to exist
under a simple condition on one of the two arbitrary functions in the general
family of equations, and when this condition fails, generalized single peakon
solutions that have a time-dependent amplitude and a time-dependent speed are
shown to exist. Wave breaking criteria are outlined for this general family of

subfamily of peakon equations that possess the Hamiltonian structure shared by
the Camassa-Holm and FORQ/modified Camassa-Holm equations. Peakon
travelling-wave solutions and their features, including a variational
formulation (minimizer problem), are derived for these generalized equations. A
final main result is that $2$-peakon weak solutions are investigated and shown

compare the spatial distribution of these molecules with those of their
chemical precursors, C+, O and H2, and tracers of warm and dense gas. We assess
the spatial variation of CH+ J=2-1 velocity-resolved line profile observed with
Herschel (HIFI). The OH and CH+ lines correlate well with the high-J CO

differences in the CH+ and OH morphologies indicate that CH+ formation and
excitation are related to the observed vibrationally excited H2. This indicates
that formation pumping contributes to the excitation of CH+. Interestingly, the
peak of the rotationally excited OH 84 {\mu}m emission coincides with a bright
young object, proplyd 244-440, which shows that OH can be an excellent tracer
of UV-irradiated dense gas. The spatial distribution of CH+ and OH revealed in

conditions. Unlike traditional approaches encompassing the presence of a solid
body using conformal meshes and imposing no-slip boundary conditions on the
boundary faces of the mesh, the solid body is here represented on the Eulerian
Cartesian mesh through an ad-hoc body force evaluated on a set of Lagrangian
markers. The markers can move across the Eulerian mesh, hence allowing for a
straightforward analysis of motion or deformation of the body. The IBM method
is described and implemented in PisoFOAM, whose Pressure-Implicit

accuracy with respect to the previously mentioned constraints. Various 2D and

confining potential, in arbitrary dimensions $d$ and arbitrary temperature $T$.
The presence of the trap introduces an edge where the average density of
fermions vanishes. Far from the edge, near the center of the trap (the so
called ""bulk regime""), physical properties of the fermions have traditionally
been understood using the Local Density Approximation. However, this
approximation drastically fails near the edge where the density vanishes. In
this paper we show that, even near the edge, novel universal properties emerge,
independently of the details of the confining potential. We show that for large
$N$, these fermions in a confining trap, in arbitrary dimensions and at finite
temperature, form a determinantal point process. As a result, any $n$-point
correlation function can be expressed as an $n \times n$ determinant whose
entry is called the kernel. Near the edge, we derive the large $N$ scaling form
of the kernels. In $d=1$ and $T=0$, this reduces to the so called Airy kernel,
that appears in the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) of random matrix theory. In
$d=1$ and $T>0$ we show a remarkable connection between our kernel and the one
appearing in the $1+1$-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation at finite time.
Consequently our result provides a finite $T$ generalization of the Tracy-Widom
distribution, that describes the fluctuations of the rightmost fermion at
$T=0$. In $d>1$ and $T \geq 0$, while the connection to GUE no longer holds,
the process is still determinantal whose analysis provides a new class of

field gradient (PFG) techniques have been increasingly used to study anomalous
diffusion in NMR and MRI. However, the interpretation of PFG anomalous
diffusion is complicated. Moreover, there is not an exact signal attenuation
expression based on fractional derivatives for PFG anomalous diffusion, which
includes the finite gradient pulse width effect. In this paper, a new method, a
Mainardi-Luchko-Pagnini (MLP) phase distribution approximation, is proposed to
describe PFG fractional diffusion. MLP phase distribution is a non-Gaussian
phase distribution. From the fractional diffusion equation based on fractional
derivatives in both real space and phase space, the obtained probability
distribution function is a MLP distribution. The MLP distribution leads to a
Mittag-Leffler function based PFG signal attenuation rather than the
exponential or stretched exponential attenuation that is obtained from a
Gaussian phase distribution (GPD) under a short gradient pulse approximation.
The MLP phase distribution approximation is employed to get a complete signal
attenuation expression E{\alpha}(-Dfb*{\alpha},\b{eta}) that includes the
finite gradient pulse width effect for all three types of PFG fractional
diffusion. The results obtained in this study are in agreement with the results
from the literature. These results provide a new, convenient approximation

anisotropies at medium scales angular scales (30-200 multipoles). The search
for the primordial CMB B-mode polarization signal is challenging, because of
many difficulties: smallness of the expected signal, instrumental systematics
that could possibly induce polarization leakage from the large E signal into B,
brighter than anticipated polarized foregrounds (dust) reducing to zero the
initial hope of finding sky regions clean enough to have a direct primordial
B-modes observation. The QUBIC instrument is designed to address all aspects of
this challenge with a novel kind of instrument, a Bolometric Interferometer,
combining the background-limited sensitivity of Transition-Edge-Sensors and the
control of systematics allowed by the observation of interference fringe
patterns, while operating at two frequencies to disentangle polarized
foregrounds from primordial B mode polarization. Its characteristics are
described in details in this Technological Design Report.

applying a network-analysis method, and there is typically a theoretical
disconnect between these steps. For example, it is common to aggregate
time-varying network data into windows prior to analysis, and the tradeoffs of
this preprocessing are not well understood. Focusing on the problem of
detecting small communities in multilayer networks, we study the effects of
layer aggregation by developing random-matrix theory for modularity matrices
associated with layer-aggregated networks with $N$ nodes and $L$ layers, which
are drawn from an ensemble of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks. We study phase
transitions in which eigenvectors localize onto communities (allowing their
detection) and which occur for a given community provided its size surpasses a
detectability limit $K^*$. When layers are aggregated via a summation, we
obtain $K^*\varpropto \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{NL}/T)$, where $T$ is the number of
layers across which the community persists. Interestingly, if $T$ is allowed to
vary with $L$ then summation-based layer aggregation enhances small-community
detection even if the community persists across a vanishing fraction of layers,
provided that $T/L$ decays more slowly than $ \mathcal{O}(L^{-1/2})$. Moreover,
we find that thresholding the summation can in some cases cause $K^*$ to decay
exponentially, decreasing by orders of magnitude in a phenomenon we call
super-resolution community detection. That is, layer aggregation with
thresholding is a nonlinear data filter enabling detection of communities that
are otherwise too small to detect. Importantly, different thresholds generally
enhance the detectability of communities having different properties,
illustrating that community detection can be obscured if one analyzes network
data using a single threshold.

axisymmetric investigation of the LG (MNRAS, 459, 2237). We find that there
remains a tendency for observed RVs to exceed those predicted by our
best-fitting model. The typical mismatch is slightly higher than in our 2D
model, with a root mean square value of ${\,{\sim}\,}50$ km/s. Our main finding
is that including the 3D distribution of massive perturbing dark matter halos
is unlikely to help greatly with the high velocity galaxy problem. Nonetheless,
the 2D and 3D results differ in several other ways such as which galaxies' RVs
are most problematic and the preferred values of parameters common to both
models.
  The anomalously high RVs of several LG dwarfs may be better explained if the
Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) were once moving much faster than in our
models. This would allow LG dwarfs to gain very high RVs via gravitational
slingshot encounters with a massive fast-moving galaxy. Such a scenario is
possible in some modified gravity theories, especially those which require the
MW and M31 to have previously undergone a close flyby. In a $\Lambda$CDM
context, however, this scenario is not feasible as the resulting dynamical
friction would cause a rapid merger.

Tikhonov regularization approach we call REGCOIL in which the squared current
density is included in the objective function. Considering W7-X and NCSX
geometries, and for any desired level of regularization, we find the REGCOIL
approach simultaneously achieves lower surface-averaged and maximum values of
both current density (on the coil winding surface) and normal magnetic field
(on the desired plasma surface). This approach therefore can simultaneously
improve the free-boundary reconstruction of the target plasma shape while
substantially increasing the minimum distances between coils, preventing
collisions between coils while improving access for ports and maintenance. The
REGCOIL method also allows finer control over the level of regularization, it
preserves convexity to ensure the local optimum found is the global optimum,
and it eliminates two pathologies of NESCOIL: the resulting coil shapes become
independent of the arbitrary choice of angles used to parameterize the coil
surface, and the resulting coil shapes converge rather than diverge as Fourier
resolution is increased. We therefore contend that REGCOIL should be used
instead of NESCOIL for applications in which a fast and robust method for coil
calculation is needed, such as when targeting coil complexity in fixed-boundary
plasma optimization, or for scoping new stellarator geometries.

method. The 40 countries with generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics were treated
differently from others, in that the projections used the highly multistate
Spectrum/EPP model, a complex 15-compartment model that was designed for
short-term projections of quantities relevant to policy for the epidemic. Here
we propose a simpler approach that is more compatible with the existing UN
probabilistic projection methodology for other countries. Changes in life
expectancy are projected probabilistically using a simple time series
regression model on current life expectancy, HIV prevalence and ART coverage.
These are then converted to age- and sex-specific mortality rates using a new

reproduces the characteristic hump in middle adult mortality. These are then
input to the standard cohort-component method, as for other countries. The
method performed well in an out-of-sample cross-validation experiment. It gives
similar population projections to Spectrum/EPP in the short run, while being

grow rapidly with d. They may be reduced by using model selection to tailor the
number of parameters in the model (i.e., the size of the density matrix). Most
model selection methods typically rely on a test statistic and a null theory
that describes its behavior when two models are equally good. Here, we consider
the loglikelihood ratio. Because of the positivity constraint $\rho \geq 0$,
quantum state space does not generally satisfy local asymptotic normality,
meaning the classical null theory for the loglikelihood ratio (the Wilks
theorem) should not be used. Thus, understanding and quantifying how positivity
affects the null behavior of this test statistic is necessary for its use in
model selection for state tomography. We define a new generalization of local
asymptotic normality, metric-projected local asymptotic normality, show that
quantum state space satisfies it, and derive a replacement for the Wilks
theorem. In addition to enabling reliable model selection, our results shed
more light on the qualitative effects of the positivity constraint on state

that can be achieved in the estimation of one component of velocity through
selection of stars in key directions and use of line-of-sight velocity alone
(i.e. without incorporation of proper motion data). In this first paper we
apply our technique to stars observed in the direction of Galactic rotation in
the APOGEE survey. We first derive the distribution of azimuthal velocities,
$v_\phi$, then from these and observed radial coordinates, estimate the stellar
guiding centre radii, $R_g$, within $6.9\leq R \leq 10$ kpc with uncertainties
smaller than (or of the order of) 1kpc. We show that there is no simple way to
select a clean stellar sample based on low errors on proper motions and
distances to obtain high-quality 3D velocities and hence one should pay
particular attention when trying to identify kinematically peculiar stars based
on velocities derived using the proper motions. Using our azimuthal velocity
estimations, we investigate the joint distribution of elemental abundances and
rotational kinematics free from the blurring effects of epicyclic motions, and
we derive the $\partial v_\phi / \partial R_g$ trends for the thin and thick

a high resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation with observed evolutionary

star formation histories and quenching of central galaxies. Comparing this
model to the distribution of central galaxy star formation rates in a group

physical processes cease star formation in central galaxies. Over the stellar
mass range $10^{9.5}$ to $10^{11} \mathrm{M}_\odot$ we infer quenching
e-folding times that span $1.5$ to $0.5\; \mathrm{Gyr}$ with more massive
central galaxies quenching faster. For $\mathcal{M}_* =

4~\mathrm{Gyrs}$ from the star formation main sequence to quiescence. Compared
to satellites, central galaxies take $\sim 2~\mathrm{Gyrs}$ longer to quench
their star formation, suggesting that different mechanisms are responsible for
quenching centrals versus satellites. Finally, the central galaxy quenching
timescale we infer provides key constraints for proposed star formation
quenching mechanisms. Our timescale is generally consistent with gas depletion
timescales predicted by quenching through strangulation. However, the exact

which requires star formation to occur in clustered environments. In order to
understand the physical conditions for the formation of these stars, it is
necessary to observe isolated high-mass stars while they are still forming.
With the $Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$, we observe the seven most isolated
massive ($>$8 $M_\odot$) young stellar objects (MYSOs) in the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC). The observations show that while these MYSOs are remote from other
MYSOs, OB associations, and even from known giant molecular clouds, they are
actually not isolated at all. Imaging reveals $\sim$100 to several hundred
pre--main-sequence (PMS) stars in the vicinity of each MYSO. These previously
undetected PMS stars form prominent compact clusters around the MYSOs, and in
most cases they are also distributed sparsely across the observed regions.
Contrary to what previous high-mass field star studies show, these observations
suggest that high-mass stars may not be able to form in clusters with masses
less than 100 $M_\odot$. If these MYSOs are indeed the best candidates for
isolated high-mass star formation, then the lack of isolation is at odds with
random sampling of the IMF. Moreover, while isolated MYSOs may not exist, we
find evidence that isolated clusters containing O-stars can exist, which in

structure of our Universe from $z=0$ to $z \sim 150$, using the brightness
temperature field of spectral lines to directly observe previously unexplored
portions of out cosmic timeline. Examples of targeted lines include the
$21\,\textrm{cm}$ hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen, rotational lines of
carbon monoxide, and fine structure lines of singly ionized carbon. Recent
efforts have focused on detections of the power spectrum of spatial
fluctuations, but have been hindered by systematics such as foreground
contamination. This has motivated the decomposition of data into Fourier modes
perpendicular and parallel to the line-of-sight, which has been shown to be a
particularly powerful way to diagnose systematics. However, such a method is
well-defined only in the limit of a narrow-field, flat-sky approximation. This
limits the sensitivity of intensity mapping experiments, as it means that wide
surveys must be separately analyzed as a patchwork of smaller fields. In this
paper, we develop a framework for analyzing intensity mapping data in a
spherical Fourier-Bessel basis, which incorporates curved sky effects without
difficulty. We use our framework to generalize a number of techniques in
intensity mapping data analysis from the flat sky to the curved sky. These
include visibility-based estimators for the power spectrum, treatments of
interloper lines, and the ""foreground wedge"" signature of spectrally smooth
foregrounds.

can thus place interesting limits on number densities of massive haloes, which
are otherwise very difficult to measure. Although halo mass functions at z<8

calculate maximum galaxy stellar masses as a function of redshift given
expected halo number densities from $\Lambda$CDM. We apply similar arguments to
black holes. If their virial mass estimates are accurate, number density

warm gas, ~$10^4$ K, which are efficient in bringing gas into galaxies. We
present a phenomenological scenario where gas in such flows -- if it is shocked
as it enters the halo as we assume -- become biphasic and, as a result,
turbulent. We consider a collimated stream of warm gas that flows into a halo
from an over dense filament of the cosmic web. The post-shock streaming gas
expands because it has a higher pressure than the ambient halo gas, and
fragments as it cools. The fragmented stream forms a two phase medium: a warm
cloudy phase embedded in hot post-shock gas. We argue that the hot phase
sustains the accretion shock. A fraction of the initial kinetic energy of the
infalling gas is converted into turbulence among and within the warm clouds.
The thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas is largely determined by the
relative timescales of several processes -- the cooling, the expansion of the
post-shock gas, the amount of turbulence in the clouds, and the halo dynamics.
We expect the gas to become multiphase when the cooling and dynamical times are
of the same order-of-magnitude. In this framework, we show that this occurs in
the important mass range of ~$10^{11}$ to $10^{13}$ M$_\odot$ , where the bulk
of stars have formed in galaxies. Gas accreting along cosmic web filaments may
eventually lose coherence and mix with the ambient halo gas. Through both the
phase separation and ""disruption"" of the stream, the accretion efficiency onto
a galaxy in a halo dynamical time is lowered. De-collimating flows make the
direct interaction between galaxy feedback and accretion streams more likely,
thereby further reducing the overall accretion efficiency. Moderating the gas
accretion efficiency through these mechanisms may help to alleviate a number of
significant challenges in theoretical galaxy formation.

Following up on the seminal work by Tiret & Combes, this paper documents the

can be produced by both the dark matter and MOND formalisms, but require a much
slower orbital velocity in the MOND case. Furthermore, we find that the star
formation activity and history are significantly more extended in space and

Chandra & XMM-Newton observations at different epochs, we find that HD97658 is
a weak and soft X-ray source with signs of chromospheric variability in the
Ly-alpha line core. We determine an average reference for the intrinsic
Ly-alpha line and XUV spectrum of the star, and show that HD97658 b is in mild
conditions of irradiation compared to other known evaporating exoplanets with
an XUV irradiation about 3 times lower than the evaporating warm Neptune GJ436
b. This could be why the thermosphere of HD97658b is not expanding: the low XUV
irradiation prevents an efficient photodissociation of any putative steam
envelope. Alternatively, it could be linked to a low hydrogen content or
inefficient conversion of the stellar energy input. The HD97658 system provides
clues for understanding the stability of low-mass planet atmospheres. Our study
of HD97658 b can be seen as a control experiment of our methodology, confirming
that it does not bias detections of atmospheric escape and underlining its
strength and reliability. Our results show that stellar activity can be
efficiently discriminated from absorption signatures by a transiting exospheric
cloud. They also highlight the potential of observing the upper atmosphere of
small transiting planets to probe their physical and chemical properties

to overcome the lack of gauge symmetry of the asynchronous principles. Second,
the property of manifest covariance of the theory is also restored at all

phase transition implies that total entanglement has to reach its maximum
there. In order to fully characterize this, one has to consider multipartite
entanglement as, for instance, bipartite entanglement between individual
particles fails to signal this effect. However, quantification of multipartite
entanglement is very hard and detecting it may not be possible due to the lack
of accessibility to all individual particles. For these reasons it will be more
sensible to partition the system into relevant subsystems, each containing few
to many spins, and study entanglement between those constituents as a
coarse-grain picture of multipartite entanglement between individual particles.
In impurity systems, famously exemplified by two-impurity and two-channel Kondo
models, it is natural to divide the system into three parts, namely, impurities
and the left and right bulks. By exploiting two tripartite entanglement
measures, based on negativity, we show that at impurity quantum phase
transitions the tripartite entanglement diverges and shows scaling behavior.
While the critical exponents are different for each tripartite entanglement
measure they both provide very similar critical exponents for the two-impurity
and the two-channel Kondo models suggesting that they belong to the same
universality class.

formulated by expanding fields along a light-like direction and then
subsequently integrating out degrees-of-freedom that are away from the

Lorentz invariance -- given that SUSY is a space-time symmetry, this presents a
possible obstruction. The cleanest language with which to expose the congruence
between SUSY and SCET requires exploring two novel formalisms: collinear
fermions as two-component Weyl spinors, and SCET in light-cone gauge. By
expressing SUSY Yang-Mills in ""collinear superspace"", a slice of superspace
derived by integrating out half the fermionic coordinates, the light-cone gauge
SUSY SCET theory can be written in terms of superfields. As a byproduct,
bootstrapping up to the full theory yields the first algorithmic approach for

fluctuations of the boundary, on the scale of the wavelength. These
fluctuations are modeled as random. The turning point is many wavelengths away
from the source, which emits a pulse that propagates toward the turning point,
where it is reflected. To focus attention on this reflection, we assume that
the waveguide supports a single propagating mode from the source to the turning
point, beyond which all the waves are evanescent. We consider a scaling regime
where scattering at the random boundary has a significant effect on the
reflected pulse. In this regime scattering from the random boundary away from
the turning point is negligible, while scattering from the random boundary
around the turning point results in a strong, deterministic pulse deformation.
The reflected pulse shape is not the same as the emitted one. It is damped, due
to scattering at the boundary, and is deformed by dispersion in the waveguide.

alphabet, the state complexity of any binary boolean operation on $L'_m$ and
$L_n$ is $mn$, and that of product (concatenation) is $m 2^n - 2^{n-1}$. In
contrast to this, we show that if $L'_m$ and $L_n$ are over different
alphabets, the state complexity of union and symmetric difference is
$(m+1)(n+1)$, that of difference is $mn+m$, that of intersection is $mn$, and
that of product is $m2^n+2^{n-1}$. We also study unrestricted complexity of
binary operations in the classes of regular right, left, and two-sided ideals,
and derive tight upper bounds. The bounds for product of the unrestricted cases
(with the bounds for the restricted cases in parentheses) are as follows: right
ideals $m+2^{n-2}+2^{n-1}$ ($m+2^{n-2}$); left ideals $mn+m+n$ ($m+n-1$);
two-sided ideals $m+2n$ ($m+n-1$). The state complexities of boolean operations
on all three types of ideals are the same as those of arbitrary regular
languages, whereas that is not the case if the alphabets of the arguments are
the same. Finally, we update the known results about most complex regular,
right-ideal, left-ideal, and two-sided-ideal languages to include the
unrestricted cases.

of IC 2163 ($D\approx35.5$ Mpc). Pre-discovery ground-based imaging revealed an
associated, shorter-duration transient in the optical and near-IR (NIR). NIR
spectroscopy showed a broad ($\approx 8400$ km s$^{-1}$), double-peaked
emission line of He I at $1.083 \mu$m, indicating an explosive origin. The NIR
spectrum of SPIRITS 15c is similar to that of the Type IIb SN 2011dh at a phase
of $\approx 200$ days. Assuming $A_V = 2.2$ mag of extinction in SPIRITS 15c
provides a good match between their optical light curves. The IR light curves
and the extreme $[3.6]-[4.5]$ color cannot be explained using only a standard
extinction law. Another luminous ($M_{4.5} = -16.1\pm0.4$ mag) event, SPIRITS
14buu, was serendipitously discovered in the same galaxy. The source displays
an optical plateau lasting $\gtrsim 80$ days, and we suggest a scenario similar
to the low-luminosity Type IIP SN 2005cs obscured by $A_V \approx 1.5$ mag.
Other classes of IR-luminous transients can likely be ruled out in both cases.
If both events are indeed SNe, this may suggest $\gtrsim 18\%$ of nearby
core-collapse SNe are missed by currently operating optical surveys.

a linear model whose operating point depends on some measurable variables,
called scheduling signals. When such a linear parameter-varying (LPV) model of
the open-loop plant needs to be derived from a set of data, several issues
arise in terms of parameterization, estimation, and validation of the model
before designing the controller. Moreover, the way modeling errors affect the
closed-loop performance is still largely unknown in the LPV context. In this
paper, a direct data-driven control method is proposed to design LPV
controllers directly from data without deriving a model of the plant. The main
idea of the approach is to use a hierarchical control architecture, where the
inner controller is designed to match a simple and a-priori specified
closed-loop behavior. Then, an outer model predictive controller is synthesized
to handle input/output constraints and to enhance the performance of the inner
loop. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by means of a simulation
and an experimental example. Practical implementation issues are also
discussed.

  Pebbling","Full version of Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2018 paper",,,,"cs.CR cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the computational complexity of finding a legal black pebbling of
a DAG $G=(V,E)$ with minimum cumulative cost. A black pebbling is a sequence
$P_0,\ldots, P_t \subseteq V$ of sets of nodes which must satisfy the following
properties: $P_0 = \emptyset$ (we start off with no pebbles on $G$),
$\mathsf{sinks}(G) \subseteq \bigcup_{j \leq t} P_j$ (every sink node was
pebbled at some point) and $\mathsf{parents}\big(P_{i+1}\backslash P_i\big)
\subseteq P_i$ (we can only place a new pebble on a node $v$ if all of $v$'s
parents had a pebble during the last round). The cumulative cost of a pebbling
$P_0,P_1,\ldots, P_t \subseteq V$ is $\mathsf{cc}(P) = | P_1| + \ldots + |
P_t|$. The cumulative pebbling cost is an especially important security metric
for data-independent memory hard functions, an important primitive for password
hashing. Thus, an efficient (approximation) algorithm would be an invaluable
tool for the cryptanalysis of password hash functions as it would provide an
automated tool to establish tight bounds on the amortized space-time cost of
computing the function. We show that such a tool is unlikely to exist. In
particular, we prove the following results. (1) It is
$\texttt{NP}\mbox{-}\texttt{Hard}$ to find a pebbling minimizing cumulative
cost. (2) The natural linear program relaxation for the problem has integrality
gap $\tilde{O}(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in $G$. We conjecture that
the problem is hard to approximate. (3) We show that a related problem, find
the minimum size subset $S\subseteq V$ such that $\textsf{depth}(G-S) \leq d$,
is also $\texttt{NP}\mbox{-}\texttt{Hard}$. In fact, under the unique games
conjecture there is no $(2-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm.

the atmosphere, comparable to that of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs).
The air shower profile of a magnetic monopole can be effectively distinguished
by the fluorescence detector from that of standard UHECRs. No candidate was
found in the data collected between 2004 and 2012, with an expected background
of less than 0.1 event from UHECRs. The corresponding 90% confidence level
(C.L.) upper limits on the flux of ultra-relativistic magnetic monopoles range
from $10^{-19}$ (cm$^{2}$ sr s)$^{-1}$ for a Lorentz factor $\gamma=10^9$ to
$2.5 \times10^{-21}$ (cm$^{2}$ sr s)$^{-1}$ for $\gamma=10^{12}$. These results
- the first obtained with a UHECR detector - improve previously published

332P/Ikeya-Murakami taken using the Hubble Space Telescope. Our images reveal a
dust-bathed cluster of fragments receding from their parent nucleus at
projected speeds in the range 0.06 to 3.5 m s$^{-1}$ from which we estimate
ejection times from October to December 2015. The number of fragments with
effective radii $\gtrsim$20 m follows a differential power law with index
$\gamma$ = -3.6$\pm$0.6, while smaller fragments are less abundant than
expected from an extrapolation of this power-law. We argue that, in addition to
losses due to observational selection, torques from anisotropic outgassing are
capable of destroying the small fragments by driving them quickly to rotational
instability. Specifically, the spin-up times of fragments $\lesssim$20 m in
radius are shorter than the time elapsed since ejection from the parent
nucleus. The effective radius of the parent nucleus is $r_e \le$ 275 m
(geometric albedo 0.04 assumed). This is about seven times smaller than
previous estimates and results in a nucleus mass at least 300 times smaller
than previously thought. The mass in solid pieces, $2\times10^9$ kg, is about
4% of the mass of the parent nucleus. As a result of its small size, the parent
nucleus also has a short spin-up time. Brightness variations in time-resolved
nucleus photometry are consistent with rotational instability playing a role in
the release of fragments.

of all fundamental interactions including gravity. However, these theories are
formulated consistently only in 10 spacetime dimensions. Therefore, to connect
to the observable world, it is required to compactify 6 out of those 10
dimensions in a suitable fashion.
  In this thesis, we mainly consider compactifications of type II string
theories on Calabi-Yau threefolds. As a consequence, the resulting four
dimensional theories preserve $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry. In these cases the
metrics on the moduli spaces of the matter multiplets, vector and
hypermultiplets, completely determine the low energy theories. Whereas the
former are very well understood by now, the complete description of
hypermultiplets is more complicated. In fact, hypermultiplets receive both
perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. The thesis mainly pertains to
the understanding of the non-perturbative corrections. Our findings for the
hypermultiplets rely on the so called twistorial construction. We discuss this
technique in details and use it throughout the course of this thesis. In
particular, armed with this, and exploiting various symmetries, especially
S-duality and mirror symmetry, we discuss the procedure to derive the D-brane
and NS5-brane instanton corrections to the hypermultiplet moduli space.

rapidly accreting SMSs by solving the stellar structure equations including
nuclear burning as well as general relativistic (GR) effects up to the onset of
the collapse. We find that such SMSs have less concentrated structure than
fully-convective counterpart, which is often postulated for non-accreting ones.
This effect stabilizes the stars against GR instability even above the
classical upper mass limit $\gtrsim 10^5~M_\odot$ derived for the
fully-convective stars. The accreting SMS begins to collapse at the higher mass
with the higher accretion rate. The collapse occurs when the nuclear fuel is
exhausted only for cases with $\dot M \lesssim 0.1~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. With
$\dot{M} \simeq 0.3 - 1~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$, the star becomes GR-unstable
during the helium-burning stage at $M \simeq 2 - 3.5~\times 10^5~M_\odot$. In
an extreme case with $10~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$, the star does not collapse

the hydrogen-burning stage. We expect that BHs with roughly the same mass will
be left behind after the collapse in all the cases.

fields can be formulated as twisted self-duality conditions on the higher spin
curvatures of the spin-$s$ field and its dual. We focus on the case of four
spacetime dimensions, but formulate our results in a manner applicable to
higher spacetime dimensions. The twisted self-duality conditions are redundant
and we exhibit a non-redundant subset of conditions, which have the remarkable
property to involve only first-order derivatives with respect to time. This
non-redundant subset equates the electric field of the spin-$s$ field (which we
define) to the magnetic field of its dual (which we also define), and vice
versa. The non-redundant subset of twisted self-duality conditions involve the
purely spatial components of the spin-$s$ field and its dual, and also the
components of the fields with one zero index. One can get rid of these gauge
components by taking the curl of the equations, which does not change their
physical content. In this form, the twisted self-duality conditions can be
derived from a variational principle that involves prepotentials, which are the
higher spin generalizations of the prepotentials previously found in the spins
2 and 3 cases. The prepotentials have again the intriguing feature of
possessing both higher spin diffeomorphism invariance and higher spin conformal
geometry. The tools introduced in an earlier paper for handling higher spin
conformal geometry turn out to be crucial for streamlining the analysis. In
four spacetime dimensions where the electric and magnetic fields are tensor
fields of the same type, the twisted self-duality conditions enjoy an $SO(2)$
electric-magnetic invariance. We explicitly show that this symmetry is an

resolution (factor >2 better in UKIDSS), our aim is to investigate whether
there are multiple UKIDSS sources that might all contribute to the GLIMPSE
flux, or there is only one dominant UKIDSS counterpart. We then study possible
corrections to estimates of the SFR based on counts of GLIMPSE young stellar
objects (YSOs). This represents an exploratory work towards the construction of
a hierarchical YSO catalog. After performing PSF fitting photometry in the
UKIDSS data, we implemented a technique to automatically recognize the dominant
UKIDSS sources by evaluating their match with the spectral energy distribution
(SED) of the associated GLIMPSE red sources. This is a generic method which
could be robustly applied for matching SEDs across gaps at other wavelengths.
We found that most (87.0% +- 1.6%) of the candidate YSOs from the GLIMPSE red
source catalog have only one dominant UKIDSS counterpart which matches the
mid-infrared SED (fainter associated UKIDSS sources might still be present).
Though at first sight this could seem surprising, given that YSOs are typically
in clustered environments, we argue that within the mass range covered by the
GLIMPSE YSO candidates (intermediate to high masses), clustering with objects
with comparable mass is unlikely at the GLIMPSE resolution. Indeed, by
performing simple clustering experiments based on a population synthesis model
of Galactic YSOs, we found that although ~60% of the GLIMPSE YSO enclose at
least two UKIDSS sources, in general only one dominates the flux. No
significant corrections are needed for estimates of the SFR of the Milky Way
based on the assumption that the GLIMPSE YSOs are individual objects.

of $\Delta m15(B)=1.35 \pm 0.03$ mag, placing it in the region between normal

constraints on the epoch of first light and form of the early-time light curve.
The spectra exhibit photospheric C II $\lambda 6580$ absorption until $-4$
days, and high-velocity Ca II is particularly strong at $<-10$ days at
expansion velocities of $\simeq$23000\kms. At early times, our spectral
modelling with syn++ shows strong evidence for iron-peak elements (Fe II, Cr
II, Ti II, and V II) expanding at velocities $>14000$ km s$^{-1}$, suggesting
mixing in the outermost layers of the SN ejecta. Although unusual in SN Ia
spectra, including V II in the modelling significantly improves the spectral
fits. Intriguingly, we detect an absorption feature at $\sim$6800 \AA\ that
persists until maximum light. Our favoured explanation for this line is
photospheric Al II, which has never been claimed before in SNe Ia, although
detached high-velocity C II material could also be responsible. In both cases
the absorbing material seems to be confined to a relatively narrow region in
velocity space. The nucleosynthesis of detectable amounts of Al II would argue
against a low-metallicity white dwarf progenitor. We also show that this 6800

sparse representations of the candidate phenotypes, for example each phenotype
derived from patients' medication and diagnosis data should preferably be

also indicates which of the components of the free energy can benefit from a
cancellation of errors that can redeem the predictive power of approximate

construct a probabilistic generative model for the dusty distribution of
extinguished absolute magnitudes and apparent colors as the convolution of a
intrinsic SN Ia color-magnitude distribution and a host galaxy dust
reddening-extinction distribution. If the intrinsic color-magnitude ($M_B$ vs.
$B-V$) slope $\beta_{int}$ differs from the host galaxy dust law $R_B$, this
convolution results in a specific curve of mean extinguished absolute magnitude
vs. apparent color. The derivative of this curve smoothly transitions from
$\beta_{int}$ in the blue tail to $R_B$ in the red tail of the apparent color

near the average apparent color, resulting in an apparent slope $\beta_{app}$
between $\beta_{int}$ and $R_B$. We incorporate these effects into a
hierarchical Bayesian statistical model for SN Ia light curve measurements, and
analyze a dataset of SALT2 optical light curve fits of 248 nearby SN Ia at z <

integrating out fermions becomes complex, and its phase plays a crucial role in
the determination of the vacuum. An example of this is QCD at low temperature
and high density, where various exotic fermion condensates are conjectured to
form. Another example is the Euclidean version of the type IIB matrix model for
10d superstring theory, where spontaneous breaking of the SO(10) rotational
symmetry down to SO(4) is expected to occur. When one applies the complex
Langevin method to these systems, one encounters the singular-drift problem
associated with the appearance of nearly zero eigenvalues of the Dirac
operator. Here we propose to avoid this problem by deforming the action with a
fermion bilinear term. The results for the original system are obtained by
extrapolations with respect to the deformation parameter. We demonstrate the
power of this approach by applying it to a simple matrix model, in which
spontaneous symmetry breaking from SO(4) to SO(2) is expected to occur due to
the phase of the complex fermion determinant. Unlike previous work based on a
reweighting-type method, we are able to determine the true vacuum by
calculating the order parameters, which agree with the prediction by the
Gaussian expansion method.

vicinity of such a catastrophe the wave function takes on a universal form

the total number of particles $N$. In the thermodynamic limit ($N \rightarrow

interference pattern. This pattern contains an intricate network of
vortex-antivortex pairs, initiating a theory of topological structures in Fock

optimal pulse sequence, we used the computationally inexpensive time-dependent
configuration interaction singles (TDCIS) method. TDCIS captures all of the
necessary correlation of the desired processes but assumes that ionization
pathways reached via double excitations are not present. MCTDHF includes these
pathways and all multiparticle correlations in a set of time-dependent
orbitals. The mechanism that was determined to be optimal in the Raman
excitation of the Ne $1s^22s^22p^53p^1$ valence state via the metastable
$1s^22s^12p^63p^1$ resonance state involves a sequential resonance-valence
excitation. First, a long pump pulse excites the core-hole state, and then a
shorter Stokes pulse transfers the population to the valence state. This
process represents the first step in a multidimensional x-ray spectroscopy
scheme that will provide a local probe of valence electronic correlations.
Although at the optimal pulse intensities at the TDCIS level of theory the
MCTDHF method predicts multiple ionization of the atom, at slightly lower
intensities (reduced by a factor of about 4) the TDCIS mechanism is shown to
hold qualitatively. Quantitatively, the MCTDHF populations are reduced from the
TDCIS calculations by a factor of 4.

structures. An important task is collective classification, which is to jointly
classify networked objects. While it holds a great promise to produce a better
accuracy than non-collective classifiers, collective classification is
computational challenging and has not leveraged on the recent breakthroughs of
deep learning. We present Column Network (CLN), a novel deep learning model for
collective classification in multi-relational domains. CLN has many desirable
theoretical properties: (i) it encodes multi-relations between any two
instances; (ii) it is deep and compact, allowing complex functions to be
approximated at the network level with a small set of free parameters; (iii)
local and relational features are learned simultaneously; (iv) long-range,
higher-order dependencies between instances are supported naturally; and (v)
crucially, learning and inference are efficient, linear in the size of the
network and the number of relations. We evaluate CLN on multiple real-world
applications: (a) delay prediction in software projects, (b) PubMed Diabetes
publication classification and (c) film genre classification. In all
applications, CLN demonstrates a higher accuracy than state-of-the-art rivals.

modulus of 24.77 +/-0.08 - identical to the host galaxy. The ratio of overtone
to fundamental mode variables and their mean periods make DDO216-A1 an
Oosterhoff Type I cluster. We find an I-band central surface brightness 20.85

cluster somewhat typical of some dwarf galaxies and the outer halo of the Milky

central compared to most dwarf galaxy globular clusters. Analytical models of
dynamical friction and tidal destruction suggest that it probably formed at a
larger distance, up to ~1 kpc, and migrated inward. DDO216 has an unexceptional

implementations of access control predates the Internet. These assertions are
made to pinpoint that there is a foundational gap in this field, and one should
consider revisiting the concepts from the ground up. Moreover, Insider threats,
which are an increasing threat vector against organizations are also associated
with the failure of access control. Access control models derived from access
control matrix encompass three sets of entities, Subjects, Objects and
Operations. Typically, objects are considered to be files and operations are
regarded as Read, Write, and Execute. This implies an `open sesame' approach
when granting access to data, i.e. once access is granted, there is no
restriction on command executions. Inspired by Functional Encryption, we
propose applying access authorizations at a much finer granularity, but instead
of an ad-hoc or computationally hard cryptographic approach, we postulate a
foundational transformation to access control. From an abstract viewpoint, we
suggest storing access authorizations as a three-dimensional tensor, which we
call Access Control Tensor (ACT). In Function-based Access Control (FBAC),
applications do not give blind folded execution right and can only invoke
commands that have been authorized for data segments. In other words, one might
be authorized to use a certain command on one object, while being forbidden to
use exactly the same command on another object. The theoretical foundations of
FBAC are presented along with Policy, Enforcement and Implementation (PEI)
requirements of it. A critical analysis of the advantages of deploying FBAC,
how it will result in developing a new generation of applications, and
compatibility with existing models and systems is also included. Finally, a

separated packet and circuit planes which do not have the ability to utilize an
optical circuit with flows that do not arrive from or delivered to switches
directly connected to the circuit's end-points. Moreover, current SDN-based
elephant flow rerouting methods require a forwarding rule for each flow, which
raise scalability issues. In this paper, we present C-Share -- a practical,
scalable SDN-based circuit sharing solution for data center networks. C-Share
inherently enable elephant flows to share optical circuits by exploiting a flat
upper tier network topology. C-Share is based on a scalable and decoupled
SDN-based elephant flow rerouting method comprised of elephant flow detection,
tagging and identification, which is utilized by using a prevalent network
sampling method (e.g., sFlow). C-Share requires only a single OpenFlow rule for
each optical circuit, and therefore significantly reduces the required OpenFlow
rule entry footprint and setup rule rate. It also mitigates the OpenFlow
outbound latency for subsequent elephant flows. We implement a proof-of-concept
system for C-Share based on Mininet, and test the scalability of C-Share by
using an event driven simulation. Our results show a consistent increase in the
mice/elephant flow separation in the network which, in turn, improves both

The particular heterostructures we address exhibit finite range proximity
effects leading to nodal superconductors with Majorana modes localized well
away from this interface. To show this, we implement a Bogoliubov-de Gennes
(BdG) proximity numerical scheme, which importantly, involves two finite
dimensions in a three dimensional junction. Incorporating this level of
numerical complexity serves to distinguish ours from alternative numerical BdG
approaches which are limited by generally assuming translational invariance or
periodic boundary conditions along multiple directions. With this access to the
edges, we are then able to illustrate in a concrete fashion the wavefunctions
of Majorana zero modes, and, moreover, address finite size effects. In the

pre-existing cellular networks has received much attention due to the potential
of enhancing the total cell throughput, reducing power consumption and
increasing the instantaneous data rate. In this paper we propose a distributed
power allocation scheme for D2D OFDMA communications and, in particular, we
consider the two operating modes amenable to a distributed implementation:
dedicated and reuse modes. The proposed schemes address the problem of
maximizing the users' sum rate subject to power constraints, which is known to
be nonconvex and, as such, extremely difficult to be solved exactly. We propose
here a fresh approach to this well-known problem, capitalizing on the fact that
the power allocation problem can be modeled as a potential game. Exploiting the
potential games property of converging under better response dynamics, we
propose two fully distributed iterative algorithms, one for each operation mode
considered, where each user updates sequentially and autonomously its power
allocation. Numerical results, computed for several different user scenarios,
show that the proposed methods, which converge to one of the local maxima of
the objective function, exhibit performance close to the maximum achievable
optimum and outperform other schemes presented in the literature.

Multiplexing (OFDM) and single-carrier schemes are developed. A Cram\'er-Rao
Lower Bound for the estimation problems is derived. The two nonlinear
algorithms Expectation Maximization (EM) and Generalized Approximate Message
Passing (GAMP) are adapted to the problems, and a linear method based on the
Bussgang theorem is proposed. In the OFDM case, the linear method enables
subcarrier-wise estimation, greatly reducing computational complexity.
Simulations are carried out to compare the algorithms with different settings.
The results turn out to be close to the Cram\'er-Rao bound in the low Signal to
Noise Ratio (SNR) region. The OFDM setting is more suitable for the nonlinear
algorithms, and that the linear methods incur a performance loss with respect
to the nonlinear approaches. In the relevant low and medium SNR regions, the
loss amounts to 2-3 dB and might well be justified in exchange for the reduced
computational effort, especially in Massive MIMO settings.

when nodes are distinguished by a binary characteristic. Under these
circumstances two independent parameters, namely dyadicity and heterophilicity,
are able to measure how much the assigned characteristic affects the network
topology. All possible configurations can be represented in a phase diagram
lying in a two-dimensional space that represents the feasible region of the
dyadic effect, which is bound by two upper bounds on dyadicity and
heterophilicity. Using some network's structural arguments, we are able to
improve such upper bounds and introduce two new lower bounds, providing a
reduction of the feasible region of the dyadic effect as well as constraining
dyadicity and heterophilicity within a specific range. Some computational
experiences show the bounds' effectiveness and their usefulness with regards to
different classes of networks.

spin values of Mn and Co atoms obtained from the K$\beta$ XES data. From this

TbMnO$_3$ as a divalent ion in HS state, destabilizing the Mn long range
magnetic order since very low doping compositions (${\rm x} \le 0.1$). Samples
in the intermediate composition range ($0.4 \le {\rm x} \le 0.6$) adopt the
crystal structure of a double perovskite with long range ferromagnetic ordering
which is due to Mn$^{4+}$-O-Co$^{2+}$ superexchange interactions with both
cations in HS configuration. Ferromagnetism vanishes for ${\rm x} \ge 0.7$ due
to the structural disorder that collapses the double perovskite structure. The
spectroscopic techniques reveal the occurrence of Mn$^{4+}$ HS and a
fluctuating valence state Co$^{2+}$ HS/Co$^{3+}$ LS in this composition range.
Disorder and competitive interactions lead to a magnetic glassy behaviour in
these samples.

At a finite temperature, one can use thermal entropy to study thermodynamical
properties. At zero temperature, entanglement entropy is expected to provide a
suitable order parameter of a phase structure. Especially, the entanglement
entropy exhibits an interesting codimension two area law in a strongly coupled
conformal field theory. We compute thermal entropy in a non-relativistic model
with an infinite fermion mass limit from an exact effective potential to obtain
thermal entropy at an infinite strong coupling limit. The computational result
provides vanishing thermal entropy at an infinite strong coupling limit with a
finite lattice spacing. The non-trivial topological term can be included in the
strongly coupled lattice system to obtain the non-trivial entropy and the
topology can be marked from the entropy. We first compute the thermal entropy
in a two dimensional lattice topological quantum field theory to study the
lattice artifact and also argue that a theory possibly has translational
invariance if a system does not have a volume law in the entanglement entropy.
Finally, we show that a coefficient of a universal term of the entanglement
entropy should not be affected by a choice of an entangling surface in two
dimensional conformal field theory for one interval case. We also discuss a
choice of the entangling surface in the entanglement entropy in two dimensional
$\mathrm{CP}^{N-1}$ model at the large $N$ limit.

the range of scales in which quantities measured in them represent accurately
the continuum limit, is an important open question. We address it here using
scale-free models, for which self-similarity provides a powerful tool to
control resolution. Such models also provide a robust testing ground for the
so-called stable clustering approximation, which gives simple predictions for
them. Studying large N-body simulations of such models with different force
smoothing, we find that these two issues are in fact very closely related: our
conclusion is that the accuracy of two point statistics in the non-linear
regime starts to degrade strongly around the scale at which their behaviour
deviates from that predicted by the stable clustering hypothesis. Physically
the association of the two scales is in fact simple to understand: stable
clustering fails to be a good approximation when there are strong interactions
of structures (in particular merging) and it is precisely such non-linear
processes which are sensitive to fluctuations at the smaller scales affected by
discretisation. Resolution may be further degraded if the short distance
gravitational smoothing scale is larger than the scale to which stable
clustering can propagate. We examine in detail the very different conclusions
of studies by Smith et al. (2003) and Widrow et al. (2009} and find that the
strong deviations from stable clustering reported by these works are the
results of over-optimistic assumptions about scales resolved accurately by the
measured power spectra, and the reliance on Fourier space analysis. We
emphasise the much poorer resolution obtained with the power spectrum compared
to the two point correlation function..

the convergence/divergence of naturally occurring sums. We prove that an IFS is
approximation regular if it consists of conformal mappings and satisfies the
open set condition. The divergence condition we introduce incorporates the
inhomogeneity present within the IFS. We demonstrate via an example that such
an approach is essential. We also formulate an analogue of the Duffin-Schaeffer
conjecture and show that it holds for a set of full Hausdorff dimension.
  Combining our results with the mass transference principle of Beresnevich and
Velani \cite{BerVel}, we prove a general result that implies the existence of
exceptional points within the attractor of our IFS. These points are
exceptional in the sense that they are ""very well approximated"". As a corollary
of this result, we obtain a general solution to a problem of Mahler, and prove
that there are badly approximable numbers that are very well approximated by
quadratic irrationals.
  The ideas put forward in this paper are introduced in the general setting of
IFSs that may contain overlaps. We believe that by viewing IFS's from the
perspective of metric number theory, one can gain a greater insight into the
extent to which they overlap. The results of this paper should be interpreted
as a first step in this investigation.

over the 16-year mission lifetime of RXTE using a simple phenomenological
model. As these black holes vary widely in luminosity and progress through a
sequence of spectral states, which we broadly refer to as hard and soft, we
focus on two spectral components: The Compton power law and the reflection
spectrum it generates by illuminating the accretion disk. Our proxy for the
strength of reflection is the equivalent width of the Fe-K line as measured
with respect to the power law. A key distinction of our work is that for all
states we estimate the continuum under the line by excluding the thermal disk
component and using only the component that is responsible for fluorescing the
Fe-K line, namely the Compton power law. We find that reflection is several
times more pronounced (~3) in soft compared to hard spectral states. This is
most readily caused by the dilution of the Fe line amplitude from Compton
scattering in the corona, which has a higher optical depth in hard states.
Alternatively, this could be explained by a more compact corona in soft
(compared to hard) states, which would result in a higher reflection fraction.

reduction can be very efficient when the signals of interest have a strong

feature clustering schemes for data reductions that capture this structure. An
impediment to fast dimension reduction is that good clustering comes with large
algorithmic costs. We address it by contributing a linear-time agglomerative
clustering scheme, Recursive Nearest Agglomeration (ReNA). Unlike existing fast
agglomerative schemes, it avoids the creation of giant clusters. We empirically
validate that it approximates the data as well as traditional
variance-minimizing clustering schemes that have a quadratic complexity. In
addition, we analyze signal approximation with feature clustering and show that
it can remove noise, improving subsequent analysis steps. As a consequence,
data reduction by clustering features with ReNA yields very fast and accurate
models, enabling to process large datasets on budget. Our theoretical analysis
is backed by extensive experiments on publicly-available data that illustrate
the computation efficiency and the denoising properties of the resulting
dimension reduction scheme.

self-consistent charge and spin densities found from the ab initio and model
calculations have to be as close to each other as possible. The analysis of the
model allows for detailed understanding of the role played by different
parameters of the model in the physics of interest. As an example of the
approach we present the study of the effect of silicon atoms substitution by
the iron atoms and vice versa on the magnetic properties in the iron silicide
alpha-FeSi2. The DFT+GGA calculations are mapped to the model with intraatomic
Coulomb and exchange interactions, hoppings to nearest and next nearest atoms
and exchange of the delocalized electrons between iron atoms; the magnetic
moments on atoms and charge densities of the material are found
self-consistently within the Hartree-Fock approximation. We find that while the
stoichiometric alpha-FeSi2 is nonmagnetic, the substitutions generate different
magnetic structures. For example, the substitution of three Si atoms by the Fe
atoms results in the ferrimagnetic structure whereas the substitution of four
Si atoms by Fe atoms gives rise to either the nonmagnetic or the ferromagnetic
state depending on the type of local enviroment of the substitutional Fe atoms.
Besides, contrary to the commonly accepted statement that the destruction of
the magnetic moment is controlled only by the number of Fe-Si nearest
neighbors, we find that actually it is controlled by the Fe-Fe
next-nearest-neighbors. This finding led us to the counterintuitive conclusion:
an increase of Si concentration in Fe1-xSi2+x ordered alloys may lead to a
ferromagnetism. This conclusion is confirmed by the calculation within

oscillations in disordered superconducting quantum metamaterials (SQMs), i.e
artificially fabricated arrays of interacting qubits (two-levels system). An
unavoidable disorder in qubits parameters results in a substantial spread of
qubits frequencies, and in the absence of electromagnetic interaction between
qubits these individual quantum-mechanical oscillations of single qubits
manifest themselves by a large number of small resonant drops in the frequency
dependent transmission of electromagnetic waves propagating through disordered
SQM, $D(\omega)$. We show that even a weak electromagnetic interaction between
adjacent qubits can overcome the disorder and establish completely or partially
\emph{synchronized} quantum-mechanical dynamic state in the disordered SQM. In
such a state a large amount of qubits displays the collective quantum
mechanical oscillations, and this collective behavior manifests itself by a few
giant resonant drops in the $D(\omega)$ dependence. The size of a system $r_0$
showing the collective (synchronized) quantum-mechanical behavior is determined
in the one-dimensional SQMs as $r_0 \simeq a [K/\delta \Delta]^2$, where $K$,
$\delta \Delta$, $a$ are the energy of nearest-neighbor interaction, the spread
of qubits energy splitting, and the distance between qubits, accordingly. We
show that this phenomenon has an origin in the Anderson localization of
spinon-type excitations arising in the SQM. Our analysis is also in a good
accord with recent experiments on the electrodynamics of the disordered 1D

magnetic field. Here we model the $\sim~300$ km/s impact of fragments
channelled by the magnetic field close to active regions. In the observations,
the magnetic channel brightens before the fragment impact. We use a 3D-MHD
model of spherical blobs downfalling in a magnetized atmosphere. The blob
parameters are constrained from the observation. We run numerical simulations
with different ambient density and magnetic field intensity. We compare the
model emission in the 171\AA~ channel of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly with
the observed one. We find that a model of downfall channelled in a $\sim~1$MK
coronal loop confined by a magnetic field of $\sim~10-20$G, best explains
qualitatively and quantitatively the observed evolution. The blobs are highly
deformed, further fragmented, when the ram pressure becomes comparable to the
local magnetic pressure and they are deviated to be channelled by the field,
because of the differential stress applied by the perturbed magnetic field.
Ahead of them, in the relatively dense coronal medium, shock fronts propagate,
heat and brighten the channel between the cold falling plasma and the solar
surface. This study shows a new mechanism which brightens downflows channelled
by the magnetic field, such as in accreting young stars, and also works as a

employ a bottom-up strategy, creating a parcellation by clustering smaller
units. We propose a novel top-down parcellation strategy, using time courses of
instantaneous connectivity to subdivide an initial region of interest into
sub-regions. We use split-half reproducibility to choose the optimal number of
sub-regions. We apply our Instantaneous Connectivity Parcellation (ICP)
strategy on high-quality resting-state FMRI data, and demonstrate the ability
to generate parcellations for thalamus, entorhinal cortex, motor cortex, and
subcortex including brainstem and striatum. We evaluate the subdivisions
against available cytoarchitecture maps to show that the our parcellation
strategy recovers biologically valid subdivisions that adhere to known
cytoarchitectural features.

phase contrast microscopy is often preferred over fluorescence microscopy in

extremely time-consuming for large data sets. Here, we present the following
workflow based on mathematical imaging methods. In the first step, mitosis
detection is performed by means of the circular Hough transform. The obtained
circular contour subsequently serves as an initialisation for the tracking
algorithm based on variational methods. It is sub-divided into two parts: in
order to determine the beginning of the whole mitosis cycle, a backwards
tracking procedure is performed. After that, the cell is tracked forwards in
time until the end of mitosis. As a result, the average of mitosis duration and
ratios of different cell fates (cell death, no division, division into two or
more daughter cells) can be measured and statistics on cell morphologies can be
obtained. All of the tools are featured in the user-friendly

diffusions in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI). However, the analysis of PFG anomalous diffusion is complicated. In this
paper, a fractal derivative model based modified Gaussian phase distribution
method is proposed to describe PFG anomalous diffusion. By using the phase
distribution obtained from the effective phase shift diffusion method based on
fractal derivatives, and employing some of the traditional Gaussian phase
distribution approximation techniques, a general signal attenuation expression
for free fractional diffusion is derived. This expression describes a stretched
exponential function based attenuation, which is distinct from both the
exponential attenuation for normal diffusion obtained from conventional
Gaussian phase distribution approximation, and the Mittag-Leffler function
based attenuation for anomalous diffusion obtained from fractional derivative.
The obtained signal attenuation expression can analyze the finite gradient
pulse width (FGPW) effect. Additionally, it can generally be applied to all
three types of PFG fractional diffusions classified based on time derivative
order alpha and space derivative order beta. These three types of fractional
diffusions include time-fractional diffusion, space-fractional diffusion, and
general fractional diffusion. The results in this paper are consistent with
reported results based on effective phase shift diffusion equation method and
instantaneous signal attenuation method. This method provides a new, convenient
approximation formalism for analyzing PFG anomalous diffusion experiments.

Approximate Message Passing (AMP) techniques represent the state of the art for
solving under-sampling Compressed Sensing problems with random linear
measurements but there are still not clear solutions on how AMP should be
modified and how it performs with real world problems. This paper investigates
the question of whether we can employ an AMP framework for real sparse view CT

resulting in the Denoising Generalized Approximate Message Passing CT algorithm
(D-GAMP-CT). Specifically, this exploits the use of sophisticated image
denoisers to regularize the reconstruction. While in order to reduce the
probability of divergence the (Radon) system and Poisson non-linear noise model
are treated separately, exploiting the existence of efficient preconditioners
for the former and the generalized noise modelling in GAMP for the latter.
Experiments with simulated and real CT baggage scans confirm that the

on unconstrained distributed optimization and provide a passivity-based
perspective for distributed optimization algorithms. This perspective allows us
to handle communication delays while using scattering transformation. Moreover,
we extend the results to constrained distributed optimization, where it is
shown that the problem is solved by just adding one more feedback loop of a
passive system to the solution of the unconstrained ones. We also show that
delays can be incorporated in the same way as the unconstrained problems.
Finally, the algorithm is applied to a visual human localization problem using
a pedestrian detection algorithm.

evidence from flux ratios in the second event of contributions to the white

problems of a large deformed elastic beam. The total potential energy of this
beam is a nonconvex functional, which can be used to model both pre- and
post-buckling phenomena. By using a canonical dual finite element method, a new
primal-dual semi-definite programming (PD-SDP) algorithm is presented, which
can be used to obtain all possible post-buckled solutions. Applications are
illustrated by several numerical examples with different boundary conditions.
We find that the global minimum solution of the nonconvex potential leads to a
stable configuration of the buckled beam, the local maximum solution leads to
the unbuckled state, and both of these two solutions are numerically stable.
However, the local minimum solution leads to an unstable buckled state, which
is very sensitive to axial compressive forces, thickness of beam, numerical
precision, and the size of finite elements. The method and algorithm proposed
in this paper can be used for solving general nonconvex variational problems in
engineering and sciences.

nanocrystals by cation exchanges at room temperature. The coordination number
of the entering cations was found to play an important role in dictating the
reaction pathways. The exchanges with tetrahedrally coordinated cations (i.e.
with coordination number 4), such as Cd2+ or Hg2+, yielded monocrystalline CdTe
or HgTe nanocrystals with Cu2-xTe/CdTe or Cu2-xTe/HgTe Janus-like
heterostructures as intermediates. The formation of Janus-like architectures
was attributed to the high diffusion rate of the relatively small tetrahedrally
coordinated cations, which could rapidly diffuse in the Cu2-xTe NCs and
nucleate the CdTe (or HgTe) phase in a preferred region of the host structure.
Also, with both Cd2+ and Hg2+ ions the exchange led to wurtzite CdTe and HgTe
phases rather than the more stable zinc-blende ones, indicating that the anion
framework of the starting Cu2- xTe particles could be more easily deformed to
match the anion framework of the metastable wurtzite structures. As hexagonal
HgTe had never been reported to date, this represents another case of
metastable new phases that can only be accessed by cation exchange. On the
other hand, the exchanges involving octahedrally coordinated ions (i.e. with
coordination number 6), such as Pb2+ or Sn2+, yielded rock-salt polycrystalline
PbTe or SnTe nanocrystals with Cu2-xTe@PbTe or Cu2-xTe@SnTe core@shell
architectures at the early stages of the exchange process. In this case, the
octahedrally coordinated ions are probably too large to diffuse easily through
the Cu2-xTe structure: their limited diffusion rate restricts their initial
reaction to the surface of the nanocrystals, where cation exchange is initiated
unselectively, leading to core@shell architectures.

This paper investigates maximal repetition of strings drawn from stochastic

growth rate of maximal repetition are identified: an upper bound in terms of
conditional R\'enyi entropy of order $\gamma>1$ given a sufficiently long past
and a lower bound in terms of unconditional Shannon entropy ($\gamma=1$). Both
the upper and the lower bound can be proved using an inequality for the

maximal repetition with respect to the string length, recently observed for

rate given a sufficiently long past equals zero. According to this observation,
natural language cannot be faithfully modeled by a typical hidden Markov

erg) gamma-ray bursts, comparing those with and without radio afterglows. We
find that the sample of bursts with no radio afterglows has a significantly
shorter mean intrinsic duration of the prompt gamma-ray radiation, and the
distribution of this duration is significantly different from those bursts with
a radio afterglow. Although the sample with no radio afterglow has on average
lower isotropic energy, the lack of radio afterglow does not appear to be a
result of simply energetics of the burst, but a reflection of a separate
physical phenomenon likely related to the circumburst density profile. We also
find a weak correlation between the isotropic gamma-ray energy and intrinsic
duration in the sample with no radio afterglow, but not in the sample which
have observed radio afterglows. We give possible explanations for why there may
exist a sample of GRBs with no radio afterglow depending on whether the radio
emission comes from the forward or reverse shock, and why these bursts appear
to have intrinsically shorter prompt emission durations. We discuss how our
results may have implications for progenitor models of GRBs.

First, we show how to simplify the class of private states and related states

bound on the one-way distillable entanglement of private states in terms of
restricted relative entropy measures, which is tight in many cases and shows
that protocols for one-way distillation of key out of states with low
distillable entanglement lead to the distillation of data hiding states. Third,
we consider the problem of extending the distance of quantum key distribution
with help of intermediate stations. In analogy to the quantum repeater, this
paradigm has been called the quantum key repeater. We show that when extending
private states with one-way communication, the resulting rate is bounded by the
one-way distillable entanglement. In order to swap perfect secrecy it is thus
essentially optimal to use entanglement swapping.

effective Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model that cosmic inflation and dark matter
can be successfully described by a single framework. On the one hand, the
scalar channel of the NJL model plays a role of the composite inflaton (CI) and
we show that it is viable to achieve successful inflation via a non-minimal
coupling to gravity. For model of inflation, we compute the inflationary
parameters and confront them with recent Planck 2015 data. We discover that the
predictions of the model are in excellent agreement with the Planck analysis.
We also present in our model a simple connection of physics from the high
scales to low scales via renormalization group equations of the physical
parameters. On the other hand, the pseudoscalar channel can be assigned as a
candidate for composite dark matter (CD). For model of dark matter, we couple
the pseudoscalar to the Higgs sector of the standard model with the coupling
strength $\kappa$ and estimate its thermally-averaged relic abundance. We
discover that the CD mass is strongly sensitive to the coupling $\kappa$. We
find in case of light CD, $M_{s}<M_{h}/2$, that the required relic abundance is
archived for value of its mass $M_{s} \sim 61\,{\rm GeV}$ for $\kappa=0.1$.
However, in this case the CD mass can be lighter when the coupling is getting
larger. Moreover, in case of heavy CD, $M_{s}> M_{W,\,Z}$ (or $>M_{h}$), the
required relic abundance can be satisfied for value of the CD mass $M_{s}\sim
410\,{\rm GeV}$ for $\kappa = 0.5$. In contradiction to the light mass case,
however, the CD mass in this case can even be heavier when the coupling is
getting larger.

different morphology evolution and phase transition with the changing of

benefits of sun sensing without requiring a dedicated sun sensor or the sun to
be visible to the camera. We compare sun estimation methods based on
hand-crafted visual cues and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
demonstrate our approach on a combined 7.8 km of urban driving from the popular
KITTI dataset, achieving up to a 43% reduction in translational average root
mean squared error (ARMSE) and a 59% reduction in final translational drift
error compared to pure VO alone.

with limit behaviors of infinite plays: e.g., mean-payoff and total-payoff in
the quantitative setting, or parity in the qualitative one (a canonical way to
encode omega-regular properties). Those objectives offer powerful abstraction
mechanisms and often yield nice properties such as memoryless determinacy.
However, their very nature provides no guarantee on time bounds within which
something good can be witnessed. In this work, we consider two approaches
toward inclusion of time bounds in parity games. The first one, parity-response
games, is based on the notion of finitary parity games [CHH09] and parity games
with costs [FZ14,WZ16]. The second one, window parity games, is inspired by
window mean-payoff games [CDRR15]. We compare the two approaches and show that
while they prove to be equivalent in some contexts, window parity games offer a
more tractable alternative when the time bound is given as a parameter (P-c.
vs. PSPACE-C.). In particular, it provides a conservative approximation of
parity games computable in polynomial time. Furthermore, we extend both
approaches to the multi-dimension setting. We give the full picture for both
types of games with regard to complexity and memory bounds.

evaluate the posterior density at every step of the algorithm. This results in
a great computational burden in big data applications. In contrast to MCMC
methods, Stochastic Gradient MCMC (SGMCMC) algorithms such as the Stochastic
Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) only require access to a batch of the data
set at every step. This drastically improves the computational performance and
scales well to large data sets. However, the difficulty with SGMCMC algorithms
comes from the sensitivity to its parameters which are notoriously difficult to
tune. Moreover, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) scales as
$\mathcal{O}(c^{-\frac{1}{3}})$ as opposed to standard MCMC
$\mathcal{O}(c^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ where $c$ is the computational cost.

  Multi-standard Wireless Communication Receivers","20th IEEE VLSI Design and Test Symposium (VDAT-2016)",,,,"cs.IT cs.AR math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In next generation wireless communication system, wireless transceivers
should be able to handle wideband input signals compromising of multiple
communication standards.Such multi-standard wireless communication receivers
(MWCRs) need filter bank to extract the desired signal of interest from
wideband input spectrum and bring it to the baseband for further signal
processing tasks such as spectrum sensing, modulation
classification,demodulation etc.In MWCRs,rather any wireless receivers,
modulated filter banks, such as Discrete Fourier Transform Filter Banks
(DFTFB), are preferred due to their advantages such as lower area, delay and
power requirements. To support multi-standard operation, reconfigurable DFTFB
(RDFTFB) was proposed by integrating DFTFB with the coefficient decimation
method. In this paper, an efficient high speed implementation of RDFTFB on
Virtex-7 field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) has been proposed.The proposed
approach minimizes the critical path delay between clocked registers thereby
leading to significant improvement in the maximum operating frequency of the
RDFTFB. Numerically, the proposed implementation leads to 89.7% improvement in
the maximum frequency at which RDFTFB can be clocked.Furthermore,proposed
implementation leads to 18.5% reduction in the dynamic power consumption.

  Hashing",,,,,"cs.DB cs.DS cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a large dataset of binary codes and a binary query point, we address
how to efficiently find $K$ codes in the dataset that yield the largest cosine
similarities to the query. The straightforward answer to this problem is to
compare the query with all items in the dataset, but this is practical only for
small datasets. One potential solution to enhance the search time and achieve
sublinear cost is to use a hash table populated with binary codes of the
dataset and then look up the nearby buckets to the query to retrieve the
nearest neighbors. However, if codes are compared in terms of cosine similarity
rather than the Hamming distance, then the main issue is that the order of
buckets to probe is not evident. To examine this issue, we first elaborate on
the connection between the Hamming distance and the cosine similarity. Doing
this allows us to systematically find the probing sequence in the hash table.
However, solving the nearest neighbor search with a single table is only
practical for short binary codes. To address this issue, we propose the angular
multi-index hashing search algorithm which relies on building multiple hash
tables on binary code substrings. The proposed search algorithm solves the
exact angular $K$ nearest neighbor problem in a time that is often orders of
magnitude faster than the linear scan baseline and even approximation methods.

  in this paper",,,,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper reports experimental evidence for phononic low-order to high-order
harmonic conversion leading to high harmonic generation. Phononic high harmonic
generation is mediated by a threshold dependent instability of a driven phonon
mode. Once the threshold for instability is met, a cascade of harmonic
generation processes is triggered. Firstly, the up-conversion of first harmonic
phonons into second harmonic phonons is established. Subsequently, the
down-conversion of second harmonic phonons into first harmonic phonons and
conversion of first and second harmonic phonons into third harmonic phonons
occur. On the similar lines, an eventual conversion of third harmonic phonons
to high orders is also observed to commence. This physical pathway for phononic
low-order to high-order harmonic conversion may find general relevance to other
physical systems.

services, so called services chains, which consist of several interconnected
virtual network functions. This allows for the capacity to be scaled up and
down by adding or removing virtual resources. In this work, we develop a model
of a service chain and pose the dynamic allocation of resources as an
optimization problem. We design and present a set of strategies to allot
