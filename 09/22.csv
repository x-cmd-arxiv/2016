models exhibiting anomalous heat conduction is described. The framework is
applied to the harmonic chain with momentum exchange model where the
non-trivial temperature profile is calculated. In this approach one first uses
the hydrodynamic (HD) equations to calculate the equilibrium current-current
correlation function in large but finite chains, explicitly taking into account
the BCs resulting from the coupling to the heat reservoirs. Making use of a
linear response relation, the anomalous conductivity exponent $\alpha$ and an
integral equation for the temperature profile are obtained. The temperature
profile is found to be singular at the boundaries with an exponent which varies
continuously with the coupling to the heat reservoirs expressed by the BCs. In
addition, the relation between the harmonic chain and a system of
noninteracting L{\'e}vy walkers is made explicit, where different BCs of the
chain correspond to different reflection coefficients of the L{\'e}vy

programming, the question of which programming languages should be taught first
has been fiercely debated since computer science teaching started in
universities. Failure to grasp programming readily almost certainly implies
failure to progress in computer science. Inquiry: What first programming
languages are being taught? There have been regular national-scale surveys in
Australia and New Zealand, with the only US survey reporting on a small subset
of universities. This the first such national survey of universities in the UK.
Approach: We report the results of the first survey of introductory programming
courses (N=80) taught at UK universities as part of their first year computer
science (or related) degree programmes, conducted in the first half of 2016. We
report on student numbers, programming paradigm, programming languages and
environment/tools used, as well as the underpinning rationale for these
choices. Knowledge: The results in this first UK survey indicate a dominance of
Java at a time when universities are still generally teaching students who are
new to programming (and computer science), despite the fact that Python is
perceived, by the same respondents, to be both easier to teach as well as to
learn. Grounding: We compare the results of this survey with a related survey
conducted since 2010 (as well as earlier surveys from 2001 and 2003) in
Australia and New Zealand. Importance: This survey provides a starting point
for valuable pedagogic baseline data for the analysis of the art, science and
engineering of programming, in the context of substantial computer science
curriculum reform in UK schools, as well as increasing scrutiny of teaching
excellence and graduate employability for UK universities.

efficiency, relevant energy saving, while retaining safety, reliability,
scalability, virtually universal application to any brewing recipe, beer

  approach","13 pages, 7 figures",,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An alternative methodology to evaluate two-electron-repulsion integrals based
on numerical approximation is proposed. Computational chemistry has branched
into two major fields with methodologies based on quantum mechanics and
classical force fields. However, there are significant shadowy areas not
covered by any of the available methods. Many relevant systems are often too
big for traditional quantum chemical methods while being chemically too complex
for classical force fields. Examples include systems in nanomedicine, studies
of metalloproteins, etc. There is an urgent need to develop fast quantum
chemical methods able to study large and complex systems. This work is a
proof-of-concept on the numerical techniques required to develop accurate and
computationally efficient algorithms for the fast calculation of
electron-repulsion integrals, one of the most significant bottlenecks in the
extension of quantum chemistry to large systems. All concepts and calculations
were developed for the three-center integral (pxApxB|pxCpxC) with all atoms
being carbon. Starting with the analytical formulae, convenient decompositions
were tested to provide smooth two-dimensional surfaces that were easily fitted.
The approximating algorithm consisted of a multilayered approach based on
multiple fittings of two-dimensional surfaces. An important aspect of the new
method is its independence on the number of contracted Gaussian primitives. The
basis set of choice was STO-6G. In future developments, larger basis sets will
be developed. This work is part of a large effort aimed at improving the
inadequacies of existing computational chemistry methods, both based on quantum

large numbers of projection images of individual particles. To harness the full
power of this single-molecule information, we use the Bayesian inference of EM
(BioEM) formalism. By ranking structural models using posterior probabilities
calculated for individual images, BioEM in principle addresses the challenge of
working with highly dynamic or heterogeneous systems not easily handled in
traditional EM reconstruction. However, the calculation of these posteriors for
large numbers of particles and models is computationally demanding. Here we
present highly parallelized, GPU-accelerated computer software that performs
this task efficiently. Our flexible formulation employs CUDA, OpenMP, and MPI
parallelization combined with both CPU and GPU computing. The resulting BioEM
software scales nearly ideally both on pure CPU and on CPU+GPU architectures,
thus enabling Bayesian analysis of tens of thousands of images in a reasonable
time. The general mathematical framework and robust algorithms are not limited
to cryo-electron microscopy but can be generalized for electron tomography and
other imaging experiments.

previously modeled starting from an intermediate stage of growth utilizing
pre-formed planetary embryos. We present simulations that were designed to test
this idea by following the growth process from km-sized objects located between
0.7 to 1.0 au up to terrestrial planets. The simulations explore initial
conditions where the solids in the disk are planetesimals with radii initially
between 3 and 300 km, alternately including effects from a dissipating gaseous
solar nebula and collisional fragmentation. We use a new Lagrangian code known
as LIPAD (Levison et al. 2012), which is a particle-based code that models the
fragmentation, accretion and dynamical evolution of a large number of
planetesimals, and can model the entire growth process from km-sizes up to
planets. A suite of large (Mars mass) planetary embryos is complete in only 1
Myr, containing most of the system mass. A quiescent period then persists for
10-20 Myr characterized by slow diffusion of the orbits and continued accretion
of the remaining planetesimals. This is interupted by an instability that leads
to embryos crossing orbits and embyro-embryo impacts that eventually produce
the final set of planets. While this evolution is different than that found in
other works exploring an annulus, the final planetary systems are similar, with
roughly the correct number of planets and good Mars-analogs.

it improves on the many previous studies of it, with more and better data. Like
its precedents, it bears crucial ramifications for the observed dynamical
anomalies in disc galaxies, and, in particular, on their resolution by the MOND
paradigm. Their result, indeed, constitute a triumph for MOND. However, unlike
previous analyses of the MDAR, McGaugh et al. have chosen to obfuscate the MOND
roots of their analysis, and its connection with, and implications for, this
paradigm. For example, the fitting formula they use, seemingly as a result of
some unexplained inspiration, follows in its salient properties from the basic
tenets of MOND, and has already been used in the past in several MOND analyses.
No other possible origin for such a function is known. Given that this formula
had already been shown to reproduce correctly the observed rotation curves from
the baryon distribution (as a MOND effect), it must have been clear, a priory,
that it should describe correctly the MDAR, which is but a summary of rotation
curves. The present paper corrects these oversights -- bringing to light the
deep connections with MOND, suppressed by McGaugh et al. It also gives due
credit to previous works, and discusses some new, important, but less known,
aspects of this MOND relation. (Substantially abridged.)

comparison to the investigated models suggests that the broadening and the

fundamental properties of large numbers of stars, it is critical to determine
the accuracy of the scaling relations on which these measurements are based.
From several powerful validation techniques, all indications so far show that
stellar radius estimates from the asteroseismic scaling relations are accurate
to within a few percent. Eclipsing binary systems hosting at least one star
with detectable solar-like oscillations constitute the ideal test objects for
validating asteroseismic radius and mass inferences. By combining
radial-velocity measurements and photometric time series of eclipses, it is
possible to determine the masses and radii of each component of a double-lined
spectroscopic binary. We report the results of a four-year radial-velocity
survey performed with the \'echelle spectrometer of the Astrophysical Research
Consortium's 3.5-m telescope and the APOGEE spectrometer at Apache Point
Observatory. We compare the masses and radii of 10 red giants obtained by
combining radial velocities and eclipse photometry with the estimates from the
asteroseismic scaling relations. We find that the asteroseismic scaling
relations overestimate red-giant radii by about 5% on average and masses by
about 15% for stars at various stages of red-giant evolution. Systematic
overestimation of mass leads to underestimation of stellar age, which can have
important implications for ensemble asteroseismology used for Galactic studies.
As part of a second objective, where asteroseismology is used for understanding
binary systems, we confirm that oscillations of red giants in close binaries
can be suppressed enough to be undetectable, an hypothesis that was proposed in
a previous work.

In contrast to land cover mapping, it is generally not possible using overhead
imagery. The recent, explosive growth of online geo-referenced photo
collections suggests an alternate approach to geographic knowledge discovery.
In this work, we present a general framework that uses ground-level images from
Flickr for land use mapping. Our approach benefits from several novel aspects.
First, we address the nosiness of the online photo collections, such as
imprecise geolocation and uneven spatial distribution, by performing location
and indoor/outdoor filtering, and semi- supervised dataset augmentation. Our
indoor/outdoor classifier achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
bench- mark datasets and approaches human-level accuracy. Second, we utilize
high-level semantic image features extracted using deep learning, specifically
convolutional neural net- works, which allow us to achieve upwards of 76%
accuracy on a challenging eight class land use mapping problem.

(NSW), and show several closely related new results. In particular, we obtain:
  -- A new integer program for the NSW maximization problem whose fractional
relaxation has a bounded integrality gap. In contrast, the natural integer
program has an unbounded integrality gap.
  -- An improved, and tight, factor 2 analysis of the algorithm of [7]; in turn
showing that the integrality gap of the above relaxation is at most 2. The
approximation factor shown by [7] was $2e^{1/e} \approx 2.89$.
  -- A lower bound of $e^{1/e}\approx 1.44$ on the integrality gap of this
relaxation.
  -- New convex programs for natural generalizations of linear Fisher markets
and proofs that these markets admit rational equilibria.
  These results were obtained by establishing connections between previously
known disparate results, and they help uncover their mathematical
underpinnings. We show a formal connection between the convex programs of
Eisenberg and Gale and that of Shmyrev, namely that their duals are equivalent
up to a change of variables. Both programs capture equilibria of linear Fisher
markets. By adding suitable constraints to Shmyrev's program, we obtain a
convex program that captures equilibria of the spending-restricted market model
defined by [7] in the context of the NSW maximization problem. Further, adding
certain integral constraints to this program we get the integer program for the
NSW mentioned above.
  The basic tool we use is convex programming duality. In the special case of
convex programs with linear constraints (but convex objectives), we show a
particularly simple way of obtaining dual programs, putting it almost at par
with linear program duality. This simple way of finding duals has been used
subsequently for many other applications.

detection to measure the photo-luminescence intensity and observed a remarkably
strong dependence of the LAC-derived lines on the modulation frequency. Upon
decreasing of the modulation frequency from 12 kHz to 17 Hz the amplitude of
the lines increases by approximately two orders of magnitude. To take a
quantitative account for such effects, we developed a theoretical model, which
describes the spin dynamics in the coupled electron-nuclear spin system under

super-Planckian black holes, and find two choices of boundary conditions which
conserve energy and probability, as opposed to one in the continuum theory.
Another feature unique to the polymer theory is the existence of negative
energy stationary states that disappear from the spectrum as the polymer scale
goes to zero. In both theories the probability density is positive
semi-definite only for the space of positive energy stationary states.
Dynamically, we find that an initial Gaussian probability density develops
regions of negative probability as the wavepacket approaches $R=0$ and bounces.
This implies that the bouncing state is a sum of both positive and negative

  Methods: A new iPad application (app) based on a random dot stereogram was

two different distances: 3 m and at 0.4 m. Results were compared with other
commercial tests: TNO (at near) and Howard Dolman (at distance) Subjects were
cited one week later in order to repeat the same procedures for assessing
reproducibility of the tests.
  Results: Stereopsis at near was better with ST (40 arcsec) than with TNO (60
arcsec), but not significantly (p = 0.36). The agreement was good (k = 0.604)
and the reproducibility was better with ST (k = 0.801) than with TNO (k =

minimizes the gap between how these guarantees are defined and how they are
perceived. Our approach is premised on a simple observation: applications view
storage systems as black-boxes that transition through a series of states, a
subset of which are observed by applications. For maximum clarity, isolation
and consistency guarantees should be expressed as constraints on those states.
Instead, these properties are currently expressed as constraints on operation
histories that are not visible to the application. We show that adopting a
state-based approach to expressing these guarantees brings forth several
benefits. First, it makes it easier to focus on the anomalies that a given
isolation or consistency level allows (and that applications must deal with),
rather than those that it proscribes. Second, it unifies the often disparate
theories of isolation and consistency and provides a structure for composing
these guarantees. We leverage this modularity to apply to transactions
(independently of the isolation level under which they execute) the equivalence
between causal consistency and session guarantees that Chockler et al. had
proved for single operations. Third, it brings clarity to the increasingly
crowded field of proposed consistency and isolation properties by winnowing
spurious distinctions: we find that the recently proposed parallel snapshot
isolation introduced by Sovran et al. is in fact a specific implementation of
an older guarantee, lazy consistency (or PL-2+), introduced by Adya et al.

the electronic correlations on the nematic state has been theoretically poorly
investigated. In this work we study the nematic phase of iron superconductors
accounting for local correlations, including the effect of the Hund's coupling.
We show that Hund's physics strongly affects the nematic properties of the
system. It severely constraints the precise nature of the feasible
orbital-ordered state and induces a differentiation in the effective masses of
the zx=yz orbitals in the nematic phase. The latter effect leads to distinctive
signatures in different experimental probes, so far overlooked in the
interpretation of experiments. As notable examples the splittings between zx
and yz bands at Gamma and M points are modified, with important consequences
for ARPES measurements.

surface, which acts to protect finer particles underneath from erosion. River
bed-load transport is a kind of dense granular flow, and such flows are known
to vertically segregate grains. The contribution of granular physics to
river-bed armoring, however, has not been investigated. Here we examine these
connections in a laboratory river with bimodal sediment size, by tracking the
motion of particles from the surface to deep inside the bed, and find that
armor develops by two distinct mechanisms. Bed-load transport in the
near-surface layer drives rapid segregation, with a vertical advection rate
proportional to the granular shear rate. Creeping grains beneath the bed-load
layer give rise to slow but persistent segregation, which is diffusion
dominated and insensitive to shear rate. We verify these findings with a
continuum phenomenological model and discrete element method simulations. Our
results suggest that river beds armor by granular segregation from below ---
rather than fluid-driven sorting from above --- while also providing new
insights on the mechanics of segregation that are relevant to a wide range of
granular flows.

previous work on the LASSO type methods, our oracle inequalities in probability
are obtained at any confidence level for estimators with tuning parameters that
do not depend on the confidence level. This is also the reason why we are able
to establish sparsity oracle bounds in expectation for the LASSO type

  We show that such isomorphisms are quite exceptional. In particular, they
occur only when both curves are isomorphic to open subsets of the affine line
$\mathbb{A}^1$, with the same number of complement points, over any field
extension of the ground field. Moreover, the isomorphism is uniquely determined
by one of the curves, up to left composition with an automorphism of
$\mathbb{A}^2$, except in the case where the curve is isomorphic to the affine
line $\mathbb{A}^1$ or to the punctured line $\mathbb{A}^1 \setminus \{0\}$. If
one curve is isomorphic to $\mathbb{A}^1$, then both curves are in fact
equivalent to lines. In addition, for any positive integer $n$, we construct a
sequence of $n$ pairwise non-equivalent closed embeddings of $\mathbb{A}^1
\setminus \{0\}$ with isomorphic complements. In characteristic~$0$ we even
construct infinite sequences with this property.
  Finally, we give a geometric construction that produces a large family of
examples of non-isomorphic geometrically irreducible closed curves in
$\mathbb{A}^2$ that have isomorphic complements, answering negatively the
Complement Problem posed by Hanspeter Kraft.. This also gives a negative answer
to the holomorphic version of this problem in any dimension $n \geq 2$. The

metallicities (Z) we study the masses of binary black holes (BBHs) produced
dynamically and merging in the local universe ($z\lesssim0.2$). After taking
into account cosmological constraints on star-formation rate and metallicity
evolution, which realistically relate merger delay times obtained from models
with merger redshifts, we show here for the first time that while old,
metal-poor globular clusters can naturally produce merging BBHs with heavier
components, as observed in GW150914, lower-mass BBHs like GW151226 are easily
formed dynamically in younger, higher-metallicity clusters.More specifically,
we show that the mass of GW151226 is well within $1\sigma$ of the mass
distribution obtained from our models for clusters with Z/Zsun$\gtrsim0.5$.
Indeed dynamical formation of a system like GW151226 likely requires a cluster
that is younger and has a higher metallicity than typical Galactic globular
clusters. The LVT151012 system, if real, could have been created in any cluster
with Z/Zsun$\lesssim0.25$. On the other hand, GW150914 is more massive (beyond
$1\sigma$) than typical BBHs from even the lowest-metallicity (Z/Zsun=0.005)
clusters we consider, but is within $2\sigma$ of the intrinsic mass

or chemical potentials of the system, respectively. The mean-field calculations
enable us to understand the nature of the phase transitions in the fully paired
Bardeen- Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state, exotic LO phase, and partially
polarized free Fermi gas. The order of the phase transitions has been examined
and in particular we find a weak first-order phase transition between the
exotic inhomogeneous LO phase and the BCS phase. In comparison to the
three-dimensional case, where the phase diagram is dominated by a generic
separation phase, we predict a broader parameter space for the spatially
inhomogeneous LO phase. By computing the superfluid density of the LO phase at
different polarization, we show how the superfluidity of the system is
suppressed with increasing spin polarization.

  in Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks are learning models with a very high capacity and
therefore prone to over-fitting. Many regularization techniques such as
Dropout, DropConnect, and weight decay all attempt to solve the problem of
over-fitting by reducing the capacity of their respective models (Srivastava et
al., 2014), (Wan et al., 2013), (Krogh & Hertz, 1992). In this paper we
introduce a new form of regularization that guides the learning problem in a
way that reduces over-fitting without sacrificing the capacity of the model.
The mistakes that models make in early stages of training carry information
about the learning problem. By adjusting the labels of the current epoch of
training through a weighted average of the real labels, and an exponential
average of the past soft-targets we achieved a regularization scheme as
powerful as Dropout without necessarily reducing the capacity of the model, and
simplified the complexity of the learning problem. SoftTarget regularization
proved to be an effective tool in various neural network architectures.

are not statistically efficient during learning precisely because spatial
redundancy limits the information learned from neighboring pixels. We
demonstrate that (1) stratified sampling allows us to add diversity during
batch updates and (2) sampled multi-scale features allow us to explore more

improve overall accuracy. Finally, our objective is to show how a architecture

to measure the time since AT Cnc's last CN eruption, we have measured the
radial velocities of a hundred clumps in its ejecta with SITELLE, CFHT's

-455 to +490 km/s. Coupled with the known distance to AT Cnc of 460 pc (Shara

deceleration, we determine that the last CN eruption of this system occurred
$330_{-90}^{+135}$ years ago. This is the most rapid transition from a high
mass transfer rate, novalike variable to a low mass transfer rate, dwarf nova

operation of transportation networks, which are modeled as dynamical flow
networks under local routing decisions. In such systems, some external inflow
is injected to the so-called origin nodes of the network. The total inflow
arriving at each node is routed to its operational outgoing links based on
their current particle densities. The density on each link has first order
dynamics driven by the difference of its incoming and outgoing flows. A link
irreversibly fails if it reaches its jam density. Such failures may propagate
in the network and cause a systemic failure. We show that larger link
capacities do not necessarily help in preventing systemic failures under local
routing. Accordingly, we propose the use of variable speed limits to operate
the links below their capacities, when necessary, to compensate for the lack of
global information and coordination in routing decisions. Our main result shows
that systemic failures under feasible external inflows can always be averted
through a proper selection of speed limits if the routing decisions are
sufficiently responsive to local congestion and the network is initially
uncongested. This is an attractive feature as it is much easier in practice to
adjust the speed limits than to build more physical capacity or to alter
routing decisions that are determined by social behavior.

J180408.9-342058 in quiescence after its ~4.5 month outburst in 2015. The
source has been observed using Swift and XMM-Newton. Its X-ray spectra were
dominated by a thermal component. The thermal evolution showed a gradual X-ray
luminosity decay from ~18 x 10^32 to ~4 x 10^32 (D/5.8 kpc)^2 erg s^{-1}
between ~8 and ~379 d in quiescence, and the inferred neutron star surface
temperature (for an observer at infinity; using a neutron star atmosphere
model) decreased from ~100 to ~71 eV. This can be interpreted as cooling of an
accretion-heated neutron star crust. Modelling the observed temperature curve
(using NSCOOL) indicated that the source required ~1.9 MeV per accreted nucleon
of shallow heating in addition to the standard deep crustal heating to explain
its thermal evolution. Alternatively, the decay could also be modelled without
the presence of deep crustal heating, only having a shallow heat source (again
~1.9 MeV per accreted nucleon was required). However, the XMM-Newton data
statistically required an additional power-law component. This component
contributed ~30 per cent of the total unabsorbed flux in 0.5-10 keV energy
range. The physical origin of this component is unknown. One possibility is
that it arises from low-level accretion. The presence of this component in the
spectrum complicates our cooling crust interpretation because it might indicate
that the smooth luminosity and temperature decay curves we observed may not be
due to crust cooling but due to some other process.

temperatures. Through a detailed analysis of this specific clock model, we find
that the laws of thermodynamics dictate a trade-off between the amount of
dissipated heat and the clock's performance in terms of its accuracy and
resolution. Our results furthermore imply that a fundamental entropy production
is associated with the operation of any autonomous quantum clock, assuming that
quantum machines cannot achieve perfect efficiency at finite power. More
generally, autonomous clocks provide a natural framework for the exploration of
fundamental questions about time in quantum theory and beyond.

density of warm gas in the disk of HD 139614, a Herbig Ae star with a

obtained ESO/VLT CRIRES high-resolution spectra of CO ro-vibrational emission.
We derived constraints on the disk's structure by modeling the line-profiles,
the spectroastrometric signal, and the rotational diagrams using flat Keplerian
disk models. Results: We detected v=1-0 12CO, 2-1 12CO, 1-0 13CO, 1-0 C18O, and
1-0 C17O ro-vibrational lines. 12CO v=1-0 lines have an average width of 14
km/s, Tgas of 450 K and an emitting region from 1 to 15 AU. 13CO and C18O lines

emission at R>6 AU. The 12CO v=1-0 line-profile indicates that if there is a
gap in the gas it must be narrower than 2 AU. We find that a drop in the gas
surface density (delta_gas) at R<5-6 AU is required to simultaneously reproduce
the line-profiles and rotational diagrams of the three CO isotopologs.
Delta_gas can range from 10^-2 to 10^-4 depending on the gas-to-dust ratio of
the outer disk. We find that at 1<R<6 AU the gas surface density profile is
flat or increases with radius. We derive a gas column density at 1<R<6 AU of
NH=3x10^19 - 10^21 cm^-2. We find a 5sigma upper limit on NCO at R<1 AU of
5x10^15 cm^-2 (NH<5x10^19 cm^-2). Conclusions: The dust gap in the disk of HD

lower than the surface density expected from HD 139614's accretion rate

Inspired from biology, evolutionary approaches drive the morphology of a

and cross-over, mimicking the process of natural selection. However, their
extension to scenarii with multiple objectives demands efficient computational
schemes. We present a numerical technique to design photonic nanostructures
with optical properties optimized along several arbitrary objectives. This
combination of evolutionary multi-objective algorithms with frequency-domain
electro-dynamical simulations is used to design silicon nanostructures resonant
at user-defined, polarization-dependent wavelengths. The spectra of pixels
fabricated by electron beam lithography following the optimized design show
excellent agreement with the targeted objectives. The method is self-adaptive
to arbitrary constraints, and therefore particularly interesting for the design
of complex structures within technological limits.

bifocal Multizone Contact Lens (MCL) for presbyopia.
  Methods: The optical quality of a new MCL was evaluated by ray tracing
software in a model eye with pupil different diameters with the lens centered
and decentered. A stock of low addition (+1.5 D) MCL for presbyopia was ordered
for manufacturing. Power profiles were measured with a contact lens power
mapper, processed with a custom software and compared with the theoretical
design. Nine lenses from the stock were fitted to presbyopic subjects and the
visual performance was evaluated with new APPs for iPad Retina.
  Results: Numerical simulations showed that the trough the focus curve
provided by MCL has an extended depth of focus. The optical quality was not
dependent on pupil size and only decreased for lens decentered with a pupil
diameter of 4.5 mm. The manufactured MCL showed a smoothed power profile with a
less-defined zones. The bias between experimental and theoretical zone sizes
was uniform along the optical zone unless for the most central area. Eyes
fitted with the manufactured MCL showed an improvement in near Visual Acuity
(VA) and near stereopsis. Althouh Contrast Sensitivity (CS) at distance
decreased, the defocus curve for contrast showed an extended depth of focus
correlated to the ray tracing results.
  Conclusions: The understanding of vision with MCL requires a process that
involves design and characterization for detecting any defect that may have
impact in the final visual performance. Keywords: Multifocal contact lenses,

that this type of T-junction supports point-like fractionalized excitations

thermally unstable. Since these disks are observed in approximate steady state
over the instability time-scale, our accretion models in the radiation pressure

modification to the SS model, where radiation pressure is in equipartition with

show how they modify disk properties such as the Toomre parameter and central

The former leads to a strict upper limit on the mass of supermassive black

For this extreme scenario to happen, the particles have to collide at the
black-hole horizon. In this paper we show that Thorne's famous hoop conjecture
precludes this extreme scenario from occurring in realistic black-hole
spacetimes. In particular, it is shown that a new (and larger) horizon is
formed {\it before} the infalling particles reach the horizon of the original
black hole. As a consequence, the center-of-mass energy of the collisional
Penrose process is {\it bounded} from above by the simple scaling relation
${\cal E}^{\text{max}}_{\text{c.m}}/2\mu\propto(M/\mu)^{1/4}$, where $M$ and
$\mu$ are respectively the mass of the central black hole and the proper mass

$\beta$ Pictoris planetary system, a component that has been discovered in many
similarly young debris disks. We here present ALMA CO J=2-1 observations, at an
improved spectro-spatial resolution and sensitivity compared to previous CO
J=3-2 observations. We find that 1) the CO clump is radially broad, favouring
the resonant migration over the giant impact scenario for its dynamical origin,
2) the CO disk is vertically tilted compared to the main dust disk, at an angle
consistent with the scattered light warp. We then use position-velocity
diagrams to trace Keplerian radii in the orbital plane of the disk. Assuming a
perfectly edge-on geometry, this shows a CO scale height increasing with radius
as $R^{0.75}$, and an electron density (derived from CO line ratios through
NLTE analysis) in agreement with thermodynamical models. Furthermore, we show
how observations of optically thin line ratios can solve the primordial versus
secondary origin dichotomy in gas-bearing debris disks. As shown for $\beta$
Pictoris, subthermal (NLTE) CO excitation is symptomatic of H$_2$ densities
that are insufficient to shield CO from photodissociation over the system's
lifetime. This means that replenishment from exocometary volatiles must be
taking place, proving the secondary origin of the disk. In this scenario,
assuming steady state production/destruction of CO gas, we derive the CO+CO$_2$
ice abundance by mass in $\beta$ Pic's exocomets to be at most $\sim$6%,
consistent with comets in our own Solar System and in the coeval HD181327

morphological types of galaxies in the Local Universe out to around 200 Mpc
using more than 60,000 galaxies from the HyperLeda database. We divide the sky
into two opposite hemispheres and compare the abundance distribution of the
morphological types, $T$, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. This is
repeated for different directions in the sky and the KS statistic as a function
of sky coordinates is obtained. For three samples of galaxies within around
100, 150, and 200 Mpc, we find a significant hemispherical asymmetry with a
vanishingly small chance of occurring in an isotropic distribution.
Astonishingly, regardless of this extreme significance, the hemispherical
asymmetry is aligned with the Celestial Equator at the 97.1-99.8% and with the
Ecliptic at the 94.6-97.6% confidence levels, estimated using a Monte Carlo
analysis. Shifting $T$ values randomly within their uncertainties has a
negligible effect on this result. When a magnitude limit of $B\leq 15$ mag is
applied, the sample within 100 Mpc shows no significant anisotropy after random
shifting of $T$. However, the direction of the asymmetry in the samples within
150 and 200 Mpc and $B\leq 15$ mag is found to be within an angular separation
of 32 degrees from $(l,b)=(123.7, 24.6)$ with 97.2% and 99.9% confidence
levels, respectively. This direction is only 2.6 degrees away from the
Celestial North Pole. Unless the Local Universe has a significant anisotropic
distribution of galaxy types aligned with the orientation or the orbit of the
Earth (which would be a challenge for the Cosmological Principle), our results
show that there seems to be a systematic bias in the classification of galaxy
morphological types between the data from the Northern and the Southern
Equatorial sky. Further studies are absolutely needed to find out the exact
source of this anisotropy.

signal due to an additional lens mass, either another planet or another star.
We find acceptable light curve fits with two classes of models: 2-planet models
(with a single host star) and circumbinary planet models. The light curve also
reveals a significant microlensing parallax effect, which constrains the mass
of the lens system to be $M_L \approx 0.7 M_\odot$. Hubble Space Telescope
images resolve the lens and source stars from their neighbors and indicate
excess flux due to the star(s) in the lens system. This is consistent with the
predicted flux from the circumbinary models, where the lens mass is shared
between two stars, but there is not enough flux to be consistent with the
2-planet, 1-star models. So, only the circumbinary models are consistent with
the HST data. They indicate a planet of mass $m_c = 80\pm 13\,M_\oplus$,
orbiting a pair of M-dwarfs with masses of $M_A = 0.41\pm 0.07 M_\odot$ and
$M_B = 0.30\pm 0.07 M_\oplus$, which makes this the lowest mass circumbinary

center-of-mass to the separations of the two stars is $\sim 40$, so unlike most
of the circumbinary planets found by Kepler, the planet does not orbit near the

dust in such a way that mimics the infrared colors of more luminous AGNs. In

object at rest completely determines the superradiant amplification rate when
that same object is spinning. We first discuss in detail superradiant
scattering of spin 0 particles with orbital angular momentum $\ell=1$, and then
extend our analysis to higher values of orbital angular momentum and spin.
Along the way, we provide a simple derivation of vacuum friction---a ""quantum

instability due to formation of bound states and, as an illustration, we

clusters at $1.2<z<1.4$ with those of field galaxies in the GOODS-S (~30),
COSMOS (~180) and CANDELS (~220) fields. We studied the relationships among
effective radius, surface brightness, stellar mass, stellar mass density
$\Sigma_{Re}$ and central mass density $\Sigma_{1kpc}$ within 1 kpc radius. We
find that cluster ellipticals do not differ from field ellipticals: they share
the same structural parameters at fixed mass and the same scaling relations. On
the other hand, the population of field ellipticals at $z\sim1.3$ shows a
significant lack of massive ($M_*> 2\times 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$) and large (R$_e
> 4-5$ kpc) ellipticals with respect to the cluster. Nonetheless, at
$M*<2\times 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, the two populations are similar. The size-mass
relation of ellipticals at z~1.3 defines two different regimes, above and below
a transition mass $m_t\sim 2-3\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$: at lower masses the
relation is nearly flat (R$_e\propto M_*^{-0.1\pm 0.2}$), the mean radius is
constant at ~1 kpc and $\Sigma_{Re}\sim \Sigma_{1kpc}$ while, at larger masses,
the relation is R$_e\propto M*^{0.64\pm0.09}$. The transition mass marks the
mass at which galaxies reach the maximum $\Sigma_{Re}$. Also the
$\Sigma_{1kpc}$-mass relation follows two different regimes,
$\Sigma_{1kpc}\propto M*^{0.64\ >m_t}_{1.07\ <m_t}$, defining a transition mass
density $\Sigma_{1kpc}\sim 2-3\times10^3$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$. The mass density
$\Sigma_{Re}$ does not correlate with mass, dense/compact galaxies can be
assembled over a wide mass regime, independently of the environment. The
central mass density, $\Sigma_{1kpc}$, besides to be correlated with the mass,
is correlated to the age of the stellar population: the higher the central
stellar mass density, the higher the mass, the older the age of the stellar
population. [Abridged]

the clustering of supermassive black holes across cosmic time, the link between
black hole clustering and host halo masses, and the implications for black hole
duty cycles. Our predicted black hole correlation length and bias match the
observational data very well across the full redshift range probed. Black hole
clustering is strongly luminosity-dependent on small, 1-halo scales, with some
moderate dependence on larger scales of a few Mpc at intermediate redshifts. We
find black hole clustering to evolve only weakly with redshift, initially
following the behaviour of their hosts. However below z ~ 2 black hole
clustering increases faster than that of their hosts, which leads to a
significant overestimate of the clustering-predicted host halo mass. The full
distribution of host halo masses is very wide, including a low-mass tail
extending up to an order of magnitude below the naive prediction for minimum
host mass. Our black hole duty cycles follow a power-law dependence on black
hole mass and decrease with redshift, and we provide accurate analytic fits to
these. The increase in clustering amplitude at late times, however, means that
duty cycle estimates based on black hole clustering can overestimate duty
cycles substantially, by more than two orders of magnitude. We find the best
agreement when the minimum host mass is assumed to be $10^{11.2} M_\odot$ ,
which provides an accurate measure across all redshifts and luminosity ranges
probed by our simulation.

The new current representation characterizes a current as equal amounts of

of the same subject. One effort was made by Johnson to unify the origin of
electricity and magnetism, but this effort yielded a formula that is unequal to
the well-known magnetic force law. The explanation provided for the magnetic

moving at the speed of light, 2) considering the relative velocity between
moving charges, and 3) analyzing the electric field spreading in the space due
to the movement of charges inside current elements. The electric origin of the

lag behind an X-ray cool core; although the peak of the mass reconstruction is
centred on the BCG, it is also consistent with the X-ray peak given the

putative complex structures and hence revolutionized rigid protein-protein
docking. However, in current methods efficient acceleration is achieved only in
either the translational or the rotational subspace. Developing an efficient
and accurate docking method that expands FFT based sampling to 5 rotational
coordinates is an extensively studied but still unsolved problem. The algorithm
presented here retains the accuracy of earlier methods but yields at least
tenfold speedup. The improvement is due to two innovations. First, the search
space is treated as the product manifold $\mathbf{SO(3)x(SO(3)\setminus S^1)}$,
where $\mathbf{SO(3)}$ is the rotation group representing the space of the
rotating ligand, and $\mathbf{(SO(3)\setminus S^1)}$ is the space spanned by
the two Euler angles that define the orientation of the vector from the center
of the fixed receptor toward the center of the ligand. This representation
enables the use of efficient FFT methods developed for $\mathbf{SO(3)}$.
Second, we select the centers of highly populated clusters of docked
structures, rather than the lowest energy conformations, as predictions of the
complex, and hence there is no need for very high accuracy in energy
evaluation. Therefore it is sufficient to use a limited number of spherical
basis functions in the Fourier space, which increases the efficiency of
sampling while retaining the accuracy of docking results. A major advantage of
the method is that, in contrast to classical approaches, increasing the number
of correlation function terms is computationally inexpensive, which enables
using complex energy functions for scoring.

whether the MRI can grow when the initial field is turbulent. The ubiquitous
presence of turbulent or random flows in astrophysical plasmas generically
leads to a small-scale dynamo (SSD), which would provide initial seed turbulent
velocity and magnetic fields in the plasma that becomes an accretion disc. Can
the MRI grow from these more realistic initial conditions? To address this we
supply a standard shearing box with isotropically forced SSD generated magnetic
and velocity fields as initial conditions, and remove the forcing. We find that
if the initially supplied fields are too weak or too incoherent, they decay
from the initial turbulent cascade faster than they can grow via the MRI. When
the initially supplied fields are sufficient to allow MRI growth and
sustenance, the saturated stresses, large-scale fields, and power spectra match
those of the standard zero net flux MRI simulation with an initial large scale

population is systematically closer to virial equilibrium than when considering
only their interiors, with perhaps half being long-lived (10s of Myr),
pressure-confined entities which only terminally engage in vigorous massive
star formation, supporting other evidence along these lines previously

the standard Bayesian approach to this problem is to reformulate it as a
partially observable MDP (POMDP) and solve it using approximate POMDP solvers,
which are typically computationally demanding. In this paper, the problem is
analyzed through the viewpoint of quickest change detection (QCD), a set of
tools for detecting a change in the distribution of a sequence of random
variables. Current methods applying QCD to such problems only passively detect
changes by following prescribed policies, without optimizing the choice of
actions for long term performance. We demonstrate that ignoring the
reward-detection trade-off can cause a significant loss in long term rewards,
and propose a two threshold switching strategy to solve the issue. A
non-Bayesian problem formulation is also proposed for scenarios where a
Bayesian formulation cannot be defined. The performance of the proposed two

novel and stressful environment, especially if environmental novelty reveals
cryptic genetic variation that enables the evolution of increased plasticity.
However, the environmental stochasticity ubiquitous in natural systems may
alter these predictions because high plasticity may amplify
phenotype-environment mismatches. Although previous studies have highlighted
this potential detrimental effect of plasticity in stochastic environments,
they have not investigated how it affects extinction risk in the context of
evolutionary rescue and with evolving plasticity. We investigate this question
here by integrating stochastic demography with quantitative genetic theory in a
model with simultaneous change in the mean and predictability (temporal
autocorrelation) of the environment. We develop an approximate prediction of
long-term persistence under the new pattern of environmental fluctuations, and
compare it with numerical simulations for short- and long-term extinction risk.
We find that reduced predictability increases extinction risk and reduces
persistence because it increases stochastic load during rescue. This
understanding of how stochastic demography, phenotypic plasticity, and
evolution interact when evolution acts on cryptic genetic variation revealed in
a novel environment can inform expectations for invasions, extinctions, or the
emergence of chemical resistance in pests.

shortly after first core passage, one would expect the cluster galaxies and the

cluster Abell 2146-A is very unusual in that the X-ray cool core appears to
lead, rather than lag, the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) in their

systems identified on $\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$ images. In particular,
we focus on the distribution of mass in Abell 2146-A in order to determine the
centroid of the dark matter halo. We use object colours and morphologies to
identify multiple image systems; very conservatively, four of these systems are
used as constraints on a lens mass model. We find that the centroid of the dark
matter halo, constrained using the strongly lensed features, is coincident with
the BCG, with an offset of $\approx$ 2 kpc between the centres of the dark
matter halo and the BCG. Thus from the strong lensing model, the X-ray cool
core also leads the centroid of the dark matter in Abell 2146-A, with an offset
of $\approx$ 30 kpc.

landing for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). Flying insects such as honeybees perform
vertical landings by keeping flow divergence constant. This leads to an
exponential decay of both height and vertical velocity, and allows for smooth
and safe landings. However, the presence of noise and delay in obtaining flow
divergence estimates will cause instability of the landing when the control
gains are not adapted to the height. In this paper, we propose a strategy that
deals with this fundamental problem of optical flow control. The key to the
strategy lies in the use of a recent theory that allows the MAV to see distance
by means of its control instability. At the start of a landing, the MAV detects
the height by means of an oscillating movement and sets the control gains
accordingly. Then, during descent, the gains are reduced exponentially, with
mechanisms in place to reduce or increase the gains if the actual trajectory
deviates too much from an ideal constant divergence landing. Real-world
experiments demonstrate stable landings of the MAV in both indoor and windy
outdoor environments.

using statistical state dynamics (SSD) that demonstrate the benefits of
adopting this perspective for understanding turbulence in wall-bounded shear
flows. The SSD approach used in this work employs a second-order closure which
isolates the interaction between the streamwise mean and the equivalent of the
perturbation covariance. This closure restricts nonlinearity in the SSD to that
explicitly retained in the streamwise constant mean together with nonlinear
interactions between the mean and the perturbation covariance. This dynamical
restriction, in which explicit perturbation-perturbation nonlinearity is
removed from the perturbation equation, results in a simplified dynamics
referred to as the restricted nonlinear (RNL) dynamics. RNL systems in which an
ensemble of a finite number of realizations of the perturbation equation share
the same mean flow provide tractable approximations to the equivalently
infinite ensemble RNL system. The infinite ensemble system, referred to as the
S3T, introduces new analysis tools for studying turbulence. The RNL with a
single ensemble member can be alternatively viewed as a realization of RNL
dynamics. RNL systems provide computationally efficient means to approximate
the SSD, producing self-sustaining turbulence exhibiting qualitative features
similar to those observed in direct numerical simulations (DNS) despite its
greatly simplified dynamics. Finally, we show that RNL turbulence can be
supported by as few as a single streamwise varying component interacting with
the streamwise constant mean flow and that judicious selection of this
truncated support, or ""band-limiting"", can be used to improve quantitative
accuracy of RNL turbulence. The results suggest that the SSD approach provides
new analytical and computational tools allowing new insights into
wall-turbulence.

recognition that directly transcribes speech to text without any predefined
alignments. One approach is the attention-based encoder-decoder framework that
learns a mapping between variable-length input and output sequences in one step
using a purely data-driven method. The attention model has often been shown to
improve the performance over another end-to-end approach, the Connectionist
Temporal Classification (CTC), mainly because it explicitly uses the history of
the target character without any conditional independence assumptions. However,
we observed that the performance of the attention has shown poor results in
noisy condition and is hard to learn in the initial training stage with long
input sequences. This is because the attention model is too flexible to predict
proper alignments in such cases due to the lack of left-to-right constraints as
used in CTC. This paper presents a novel method for end-to-end speech
recognition to improve robustness and achieve fast convergence by using a joint
CTC-attention model within the multi-task learning framework, thereby
mitigating the alignment issue. An experiment on the WSJ and CHiME-4 tasks
demonstrates its advantages over both the CTC and attention-based

preferential site for magnetic reconnection (MR). However, the direct
observational study of MR at null-points is largely lacking. Here, we show the
observations of MR around a magnetic null associated with an eruption that
resulted in an M1.7 flare and a coronal mass ejection. The GOES X- ray profile
of the flare exhibited two peaks at 02:23 UT and 02:40 UT on 2012 November 8,
respectively. Based on the imaging observations, we find that the first and
also primary X- ray peak was originated from MR in the current sheet underneath
the erupting magnetic flux rope (MFR). On the other hand, the second and also
weaker X-ray peak was caused by MR around a null-point located above the
pre-eruption MFR. The interaction of the null-point and the erupting MFR can be
described as a two-step process. During the first step, the erupting and fast
expanding MFR passed through the null-point, resulting in a significant
displacement of the magnetic field surrounding the null. During the second
step, the displaced magnetic field started to move back, resulting in a
converging inflow and subsequently the MR around the null. The null-point
reconnection is a different process from the current sheet reconnection in this
flare; the latter is the cause of the main peak of the flare, while the former
is the cause of the secondary peak of the flare and the conspicuous high-lying
cusp structure.

incorporated in the learning in order to take the advantage of the continuity
over space, and a new aggregation method via randomly partitioning space is
introduced to improve the efficiency. We do not impose any stationarity
conditions over space either, as the learning is facilitated by the
stationarity in time. Krigings over space and time are carried out based on the
learned low-dimensional structure, which is scalable to the cases when the data

on its dual mesh are used to calculate the flux values in the cell and on the

coupled with each other, and the use of numerical flux may be avoided. The WENO
limiter is adaptively implemented via two steps: the ""troubled"" cells are first
identified by using a modified TVB minmod function, and then the WENO technique
is used to locally reconstruct new polynomials of degree $(2K+1)$ replacing the
CDG solutions inside the ""troubled' cells by the cell average values of the CDG
solutions in the neighboring cells as well as the original cell averages of the
""troubled"" cells. Because the WENO limiter is only employed for finite

accuracy of the CDG without the numerical dissipation is analyzed and
calculation of the flux integrals over the cells is also addressed. Several
test problems in one and two dimensions are solved by using our \CDG{} with

The system consists of a
one-dimensional wire with a pair of qubits embedded at its center. It is shown
that the system supports collective states localized in the left and right
sides of the wire and therefore, as a whole, performs as a single qubit. The
couplings between the ground and excited states of the two central qubits are
inversely proportional making them fully asynchronized and allowing for
coherent manipulation and gate operations. Initialization and measurement
devices, such as leads and charge detectors, connected to the edges of the wire
are modeled by a continuum of energy states. The coupling to the continuum is
discussed using the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. At weak continuum
coupling, all internal states uniformly acquire small decay widths. This
changes dramatically as the coupling strength increases: the width distribution
undergoes a sharp restructuring and is no longer uniformly divided among the
eigenstates. Two broad resonances localized at the ends of the wire are formed.
These superradiant states (analogous to Dicke states in quantum optics),
effectively protect the remaining internal states from decaying into the
continuum and hence increase the lifetime of the qubit. Environmental noise is
introduced by considering random Gaussian fluctuations of electronic energies.
The interplay between decoherence and superradiance is studied by solving the
stochastic Liouville equation. In addition to increasing the lifetime, the
emergence of the superradiant states increases the qubit coherence.

that the conformally invariant wave equation on a Minkowski background can be
solved with a fully pseudospectral numerical method. In particular, it is
possible to include spacelike infinity into the numerical domain, which is
appropriately represented as a cylinder, and highly accurate numerical
solutions can be obtained with a moderate number of gridpoints. In this paper,
we generalise these considerations to the spherically-symmetric wave equation
on a Schwarzschild background. In the Minkowski case, a logarithmic singularity
at the future boundary is present at leading order, which can easily be removed
to obtain completely regular solutions. An important new feature of the
Schwarzschild background is that the corresponding solutions develop
logarithmic singularities at infinitely many orders. This behaviour seems to be
characteristic for massive space-times. In this sense this work is indicative
of properties of the solutions of the Einstein equations near spatial infinity.
The use of fully pseudospectral methods allows us to still obtain very accurate
numerical solutions, and the convergence properties of the spectral
approximations reveal details about the singular nature of the solutions on
spacelike and null infinity. These results seem to be impossible to achieve
with other current numerical methods. Moreover, we describe how to impose
conditions on the asymptotic behaviour of initial data so that the
leading-order logarithmic terms are avoided, which further improves the
numerical accuracy.

likelihood like quantity that summarises the evidence for the series having
either no change or a specific value for its most recent changepoint. We then
post-process this output from each time-series to obtain a potentially small
set of times for the most recent changepoints, and, for each time, the set of
series which has their most recent changepoint at that time. We demonstrate the
usefulness of this method on two data sets: forecasting events in a
telecommunications network and inference about changes in the net asset ratio
for a panel of US firms.

simultaneous operation of lane keeping and adaptive cruise control. The safety
specifications for these driver assistance modules are expressed in terms of
set invariance. Control barrier functions are used to design a family of
control solutions that guarantee the forward invariance of a set, which implies
satisfaction of the safety specifications. The control barrier functions are
synthesized through a combination of sum-of-squares program and physics-based
modeling and optimization. A real-time quadratic program is posed to combine
the control barrier functions with the performance-based controllers, which can
be either expressed as control Lyapunov function conditions or as black-box
legacy controllers. In both cases, the resulting feedback control guarantees
the safety of the composed driver assistance modules in a formally correct
manner. Importantly, the quadratic program admits a closed-form solution that
can be easily implemented. The effectiveness of the control approach is
demonstrated by simulations in the industry-standard vehicle simulator Carsim.

fluxes and waveforms. These obtained polynomials are accurate enough in the
entire evolution domain, and much more accurate than the resummation
post-Newtonian (PN) energy fluxes and waveforms, especially when the spin of a
black hole becomes large. The dynamical equation we adopted for orbital
revolution is the effective-one-body (EOB) formalism. Because of the simplified
expressions, the efficiency of calculating the orbital evolution with our

We assume that the principal's objective is a monotone set function, and study
the problem both in the public signal and private signal models, drawing a
sharp contrast between the two in terms of both efficacy and computational
complexity.
  When private signals are allowed, our results are largely positive and quite
general. First, we show polynomial-time equivalence between optimal signaling
and the problem of maximizing the objective function plus an additive function.
This yields an efficient implementation of the optimal scheme when the
objective is supermodular or anonymous. Second, we exhibit a
(1-1/e)-approximation of the optimal private signaling scheme, modulo an
additive loss of $\epsilon$, when the objective function is submodular. These
two results simplify, unify, and generalize results of [Arieli and Babichenko,

slightly strengthen the result of [Babichenko and Barman, 2016] to obtain a

show that it is NP-hard to approximate the optimal public scheme, within any

maximizing the sender's objective, by a polynomial factor.

Kerr effect, in silicon waveguides two-photon absorption generates high
free-carrier densities, with corresponding fifth-order nonlinearity in the
forms of free-carrier dispersion and free-carrier absorption. However, whether
these fifth-order free-carrier nonlinear effects can lead to six-wave-mixing
dynamics still remains an open question until now. Here we report the
demonstration of free-carrier-induced six-wave mixing in silicon nanowires.
Unique features, including inverse detuning dependence of six-wave-mixing
efficiency and its higher sensitivity to pump power, are originally observed
and verfied by analytical prediction and numerical modeling. Additionally,
asymmetric sideband generation is observed for different laser detunings,
resulting from the phase-sensitive interactions between free-carrier
six-wave-mixing and Kerr four-wave-mixing dynamics. These discoveries provide a
new path for nonlinear multi-wave interactions in nanoscale platforms.

relatively new ingredients, in terms of the type of seismic data in choice, the
way to handle big seismic data and related data noise estimation, and the use
of a recently developed iterative ensemble history matching algorithm.
  In seismic history matching, it is customary to use inverted seismic
attributes, such as acoustic impedance, as the observed data. In doing so,
extra uncertainties may arise during the inversion processes. The proposed SHM
framework avoids such intermediate inversion processes by adopting amplitude
versus angle (AVA) data. In addition, SHM typically involves assimilating a
large amount of observed seismic attributes into reservoir models. To handle
the big-data problem in SHM, the proposed framework adopts the following
wavelet-based sparse representation procedure: First, a discrete wavelet
transform is applied to observed seismic attributes. Then, uncertainty analysis
is conducted in the wavelet domain to estimate noise in the resulting wavelet
coefficients, and to calculate a corresponding threshold value. Wavelet
coefficients above the threshold value, called leading wavelet coefficients
hereafter, are used as the data for history matching. The retained leading
wavelet coefficients preserve the most salient features of the observed seismic
attributes, whereas rendering a substantially smaller data size. Finally, an
iterative ensemble smoother is adopted to update reservoir models, in such a
way that the leading wavelet coefficients of simulated seismic attributes
better match those of observed seismic attributes.

quantum many-body systems belong to the most important challenges and problems
of quantum physics. In this paper we propose an efficient scheme to solve this
problem by utilizing the infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS), and
tensor network (TN) representations. We show that the criticality of a 2D state
is faithfully reproduced by the ground state (dubbed as boundary state) of a
one-dimensional effective Hamiltonian constructed from its iPEPS
representation. We demonstrate that for a critical state the correlation length
and the entanglement spectrum of the boundary state are essentially different
from those of a gapped iPEPS. This provides a solid indicator that allows to
identify the criticality of the 2D state. Our scheme is verified on the
resonating valence bond (RVB) states on kagom\'e and square lattices, where the
boundary state of the honeycomb RVB is found to be described by a $c=1$
conformal field theory. We apply our scheme also to the ground state of the
spin-1/2 XXZ model on honeycomb lattice, illustrating the difficulties of
standard variational TN approaches to study the critical ground states. Our
scheme is of high versatility and flexibility, and can be further applied to
investigate the quantum criticality in many other phenomena, such as
finite-temperature and topological phase transitions.

states always has a shortest synchronizing word of length at most $(n-1)^2$,
and he gave a sequence of DFAs for which this bound is reached.
  In this paper, we investigate the role of the alphabet size. For each
possible alphabet size, we count DFAs on $n \le 6$ states which synchronize in
$(n-1)^2 - e$ steps, for all $e < 2\lceil n/2 \rceil$. Furthermore, we give
constructions of automata with any number of states, and $3$, $4$, or $5$
symbols, which synchronize slowly, namely in $n^2 - 3n + O(1)$ steps.
  In addition, our results prove \v{C}ern\'y's conjecture for $n \le 6$. Our
computation has led to $27$ DFAs on $3$, $4$, $5$ or $6$ states, which
synchronize in $(n-1)^2$ steps, but do not belong to \v{C}ern\'y's sequence. Of
these $27$ DFA's, $19$ are new, and the remaining $8$ which were already known
are exactly the \emph{minimal} ones: they will not synchronize any more after
removing a symbol.
  So the $19$ new DFAs are extensions of automata which were already known,
including the \v{C}ern\'y automaton on $3$ states. But for $n > 3$, we prove
that the \v{C}ern\'y automaton on $n$ states does not admit non-trivial
extensions with the same smallest synchronizing word length $(n-1)^2$.

  We analyze the optical depth of these transitions and their line width. Our
models show that the carbon line components in the Perseus arm are best fit
with an electron temperature 85 K and an electron density 0.04 cm$^{-3}$ and
can be constrained to within 15\%. The electron pressure is constrained to
within 20\%. We argue that much of these carbon radio recombination lines arise
in the CO-dark surface layers of molecular clouds where most of the carbon is
ionized but hydrogen has made the transition from atomic to molecular. The
hydrogen lines are clearly associated with the carbon line emitting clouds, but
the low-frequency upperlimits indicate that they likely do not trace the same

sample of gamma-ray-detected pulsars, radio profile width is correlated with
both the separation of the main gamma-ray peaks and the presence of narrow
gamma-ray components. These findings lead us to propose that these pulsars form
a single population where the main factors determining gamma ray detectability
are the rate of rotational energy loss and the proximity of the line of sight
to the rotation axis. The expected magnetic inclination angle distribution will
be different for radio pulsars with and without detectable gamma rays,
naturally leading to the observed differences. Our results also suggest that
the geometry of existing radio and outer-magnetosphere gamma-ray emission

in multi-hop Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN). Convergecast is a many-to-one
cooperative scheme where each node of the network transmits data towards the
same sink. Our contribution is threefold. First, we stress existing WBAN
convergecast strategies with respect to their capacity to be reliable and to
ensure the total order delivery at sink. That is, packets sent in a specific
order should be received in the same order by the sink. When stressed with
transmission rates up to 500 packets per second the performances of these
strategies decrease dramatically (more than 90% of packets lost). Secondly, we
propose a new posture-centric model for WBAN. This model offers a good
characterization of the path availability which is further used to fine tune
the retransmission rate thresholds. Third, based on our model we propose a new
mechanism for reliability and a new converge-cast strategy that outperforms
WBAN dedicated strategies but also strategies adapted from DTN and WSN areas.
Our extensive performance evaluations use essential parameters for WBAN: packet
lost, total order reliability (messages sent in a specific order should be
delivered in that specific order) and various human body postures. In
particular, our strategy ensures zero packet order inversions for various
transmission rates and mobility postures. Interestingly, our strategy respects
this property without the need of additional energy-guzzler mechanisms.

order to apply the theory to the broadest class of problems. We deal with two
main issues. We first derive transparent numerical boundary conditions, that
is, we exhibit the relations satisfied by the solution to the pure Cauchy
problem when the initial condition vanishes outside of some domain. Our
derivation encompasses discretized transport, diffusion and dispersive
equations with arbitrarily wide stencils. The second issue is to prove sharp
stability estimates for the initial boundary value problem obtained by
enforcing the boundary conditions derived in the first step. We focus here on
discretized transport equations. Under the assumption that the numerical
boundary is non-characteristic, our main result characterizes the class of
numerical schemes for which the corresponding transparent boundary conditions
satisfy the so-called Uniform Kreiss-Lopatinskii Condition introduced in
[GKS72]. Adapting some previous works to the non-local boundary conditions
considered here, our analysis culminates in the derivation of trace and
semigroup estimates for such transparent numerical boundary conditions. Several

addition, we present simple but fixed theoretic constraints, preventing
effective scaling of DNN training beyond only a few dozen nodes. This leads to
poor scalability of DNN training in most practical scenarios.

show that, depending of the fluid, optical forces, even if small, slightly
modify the complex modulus at low frequencies. Based on our findings, we

field into a train of short pulses is proposed to apply in optical domain.
Effective frequency modulation can be achieved by electro-optic modulator or by
resonant frequency modulation of the filter with a narrow absorption line. Due
to frequency modulation narrow-spectrum CW radiation field is seen by the
resonant filter as a comb of equidistant spectral components separated by the
modulation frequency. Tuning narrow-bandwidth filter in resonance with $n$-th
spectral component of the comb transforms the radiation field into bunches of
pulses with $n$ pulses in each bunch. The transformation is explained by the
interference of the coherently scattered resonant component of the field with
the whole comb. Constructive interference results in formation of pulses, while
destructive interference is seen as dark windows between pulses. It is found
that the optimal thickness of the resonant filter is several orders of
magnitude smaller than the necessary thickness of the dispersive filters used
before in optical domain to produce short pulses from the frequency modulated
field.

along the other branch some of the solutions may be stable. The last point is
done by carrying out a center manifold reduction as the linearization does

magnetohydrostatic and pressure equilibrium with their surroundings obtained in
Tomisaka (2014) and show that these equilibria are dynamically stable. If the
effect of ambipolar diffusion is considered, these filaments lose magnetic
support initiating cloud collapse. The filaments do not lose magnetic flux.
Rather the magnetic flux is redistributed within the filament from the centre
towards the envelope.
  The rate of the collapse is inversely proportional to the fractional
ionisation and two gravitationally-driven ambipolar diffusion regimes for the
collapse are observed as predicted in Mouschovias & Morton (1991). For high
values of the ionisation coefficient, that is $X \geq 10^{-7}$, the gas is
strongly coupled to the magnetic field and the Jeans length is larger than the
ambipolar diffusion length scale. Then the collapse is governed by
magnetically-regulated ambipolar diffusion. For $X \lesssim 10^{-8}$, the gas
is weakly coupled to the magnetic field and the magnetic support is removed by
gravitationally-dominated ambipolar diffusion. Here, neutrals and ions only
collide sporadically, that is the ambipolar diffusion length scale is larger
than the Jeans length.
  When decaying turbulence is included, additional support is provided to the
filament. This slows down the collapse of the filament even in the absence of a
magnetic field. When a magnetic field is present, the collapse rate increases
by a ratio smaller than for the non-magnetic case. This is because of a
speed-up of the ambipolar diffusion due to larger magnetic field gradients
generated by the turbulence and because the ambipolar diffusion aids the
dissipation of turbulence below the ambipolar diffusion length scale. The
highest increase in the rate is observed for the lowest ionisation coefficient
and the highest turbulent intensity.

demonstrated by performing long term annealing on sputtered Zr/Nb nanoscale

and mechanical properties by combining analytical transmission electron
microscopy, nano-mechanical tests and finite element models. As-deposited
multilayers were annealed at 350 C in air for times ranging between 1 - 336

42% after 15 hours of annealing. Longer annealing times did not lead to changes
in hardness, although the elastic modulus increased up to 35% after 336 hrs.
The hcp Zr layers were rapidly transformed into monoclinic ZrO2 (in the first
15 hours), while the Nb layers were progressively oxidised, from top surface
down towards the substrate, to form an amorphous oxide phase at a much lower
rate. The sequential oxidation of Zr and Nb layers was key for the oxidation to
take place without rupture of the multi-layered structure and without coating
spallation, as the plastic deformation of the metallic Nb layers allowed for
the partial relieve of the residual stresses developed as a result of the
volumetric expansion of the Zr layers upon oxidation. Moreover, the development
of residual stresses induced further changes in mechanical properties in
relation to the annealing time, as revealed by finite element simulations.

by the resolvent analysis describe the wall-normal coherence of the motions and
inherit that self-similarity. In this contribution, we present the implications
of this similarity for the nonlinear interaction between modes with different
scales and wall-normal locations. By considering the nonlinear interactions
between modes, it is shown that much of the turbulence scaling behaviour in the
logarithmic region can be determined from a single arbitrarily chosen reference

equations of poroelasticity to enable solving complex models of biological
tissues such as the human lungs. For the proposed numerical scheme, we use the
lowest possible approximation order: piecewise constant approximation for the
pressure, and piecewise linear continuous elements for the displacements and
fluid flux. Due to the discontinuous pressure approximation, sharp pressure
gradients due to changes in material coefficients or boundary layer solutions
can be captured reliably. We begin by developing theoretical results for
approximating the linear poroelastic equations valid in small deformations. In
particular, we prove existence and uniqueness, an energy estimate and an
optimal a-priori error estimate for the discretised problem. We then extend
this work and construct a stabilised finite element method to solve the
poroelastic equations valid in large deformations. We present the linearisation
and discretisation for this nonlinear problem, and give a detailed account of
the implementation. We rigorously test both the linear and nonlinear finite
element method using numerous test problems to verify theoretical stability and
convergence results, and the method's ability to reliably capture steep
pressure gradients. Finally, we derive a poroelastic model for lung parenchyma
coupled to an airway fluid network model, and develop a stable method to solve
the coupled model. Numerical simulations, on a realistic lung geometry,
illustrate the coupling between the poroelastic medium and the network flow
model, and simulations of tidal breathing are shown to reproduce global
physiologically realistic measurements. We also investigate the effect of
airway constriction and tissue weakening on the ventilation, tissue stress and
alveolar pressure distribution.

carried out here for PtPc/Ag(111) and PdPc/Ag(111), is not restricted to these

variations of our sample in luminosities ($\sim$ 2 of dex), the rotation curves
in specifically normalized units, look all alike and lead to the lower-mass
version of the universal rotation curve of spiral galaxies found in Persic et

$V(R/R_{opt})/V_{opt}$ of dwarf disc galaxies: the results show that these
systems are totally dominated by dark matter whose density shows a core size
between 2 and 3 stellar disc scale lengths. Similar to galaxies of different
Hubble types and luminosities, the core radius $r_0$ and the central density
$\rho_0$ of the dark matter halo of these objects are related by $ \rho_0 r_0
\sim 100\hspace{0.1cm} \mathrm{M_\odot pc^{-2}}$. The structural properties of
the dark and luminous matter emerge very well correlated. In addition, to
describe these relations, we need to introduce a new parameter, measuring the

properties also indicate that there is no evidence of abrupt decline at the

surface irregularity at small spatial scales, and causes the thermal-infrared
beaming effect (i.e. re-radiation of absorbed sunlight back towards to the
Sun). Typically, surface roughness exhibits a degeneracy with thermal inertia
when thermophysical models are fitted to disc-integrated thermal-infrared
observations of asteroids because of this effect. In this work, it is
demonstrated how surface roughness can be constrained for near-Earth asteroid
(433) Eros (i.e. the target of NASA's NEAR Shoemaker mission) when using the
Advanced Thermophysical Model with thermal-infrared observations taken during
an ""almost pole-on"" illumination and viewing geometry. It is found that the
surface roughness of (433) Eros is characterised by an RMS slope of 38 $\pm$
8{\deg} at the 0.5-cm spatial scale associated with its thermal-infrared
beaming effect. This is slightly greater than the RMS slope of 25 $\pm$ 5{\deg}
implied by the NEAR Shoemaker laser ranging results when extrapolated to this
spatial scale, and indicates that other surface shaping processes might
operate, in addition to collisions and gravity, at spatial scales under one
metre in order to make asteroid surfaces rougher. For other high obliquity
asteroids observed during ""pole-on"" illumination conditions, the
thermal-infrared beaming effect allows surface roughness to be constrained when
the sub-solar latitude is greater than 60{\deg}, and if the asteroids are
observed at phase angles of less than 40{\deg}. They will likely exhibit NEATM
beaming parameters that are lower than expected for a typical asteroid at all

properties of the distance matrix of a graph. Two graphs are $D$-cospectral if
their distance matrices have the same spectrum. We construct infinite pairs of
$D$-cospectral graphs with different diameter and different Wiener index. A
graph is $k$-transmission-regular if its distance matrix has constant row sum
equal to $k$. We establish tight upper and lower bounds for the row sum of a
$k$-transmission-regular graph in terms of the number of vertices of the graph.
Finally, we determine the Wiener index and its complexity for linear $k$-trees,
and obtain a closed form for the Wiener index of block-clique graphs in terms
of the Laplacian eigenvalues of the graph. The latter leads to a generalization
of a result for trees which was proved independently by Mohar and Merris.

spatial concentration of cm-sized dust pebbles and subsequent gravitational
collapse have been proposed. However, numerical investigations have shown that
dust aggregates may undergo fragmentation during the gravitational collapse
phase. This fragmentation in turn changes the size distribution of the solids
and thus must be taken into account in order to understand the properties of
the planetesimals that form. To explore the fate of dust pebbles undergoing
fragmenting collisions, we conducted laboratory experiments on dust-aggregate
collisions with a focus on establishing a collision model for this stage of
planetesimal formation. In our experiments, we analysed collisions of dust
aggregates with masses between 1.4 g and 180 g, mass ratios between target and
projectile from 125 to 1 at a fixed porosity of 65%, within the velocity range
of 1.5 $-$ 8.7 $ms^{-1}$ , at low atmospheric pressure of $\sim 10^{-3}$ mbar

fragment size/mass distribution, and the efficiency of mass transfer as a

we give recipes for an easy-to-use fragmentation and mass-transfer model for
further use in modeling work. In a companion paper, we utilize the experimental

of optimizing within a parameterized family of algorithms, or equivalently a
family of functions describing the algorithmic steps. The optimization
variables are the parameters -within this family of algorithms- that encode
algorithm design: the computational steps of which the selected algorithms
consists. The objective function of the optimization problem encodes the merit
function of the algorithm, e.g., the computational cost (possibly also
including a cost component for memory requirements) of the algorithm execution.
The constraints of the optimization problem ensure convergence of the
algorithm, i.e., solution of the problem at hand. The formulation is described
prototypically for algorithms used in solving nonlinear equations and in
performing unconstrained optimization; the parametrized algorithm family
considered is that of monomials in function and derivative evaluation
(including negative powers). A prototype implementation in GAMS is developed
along with illustrative results demonstrating cases for which well-known
algorithms are shown to be optimal. The formulation is a mixed-integer
nonlinear program (MINLP). To overcome the multimodality arising from
nonconvexity in the optimization problem, a combination of brute force and
general-purpose deterministic global algorithms is employed to guarantee the
optimality of the algorithm devised. We then discuss several directions towards
which this methodology can be extended, their scope and limitations.

Given the photometric redshift depth of the ALHAMBRA multiband data (<z>=0.86)

red objects at moderate redshift. We avoid this bias by creating a new
catalogue selected in the $K_s$ band. This newly obtained catalogue is
certainly shallower in terms of apparent magnitude, but deeper in terms of
redshift, with a significant population of red objects at $z>1$. We select
objects using the $K_s$ band images, which reach an approximate AB magnitude

strongly constrains parameters related to quiescent star formation in discs,

not usually select models that match the evolution of the GSMF well.
Nevertheless, we show that a small subset of models provides acceptable match
to GSMF data out to redshift 1.5. We explore the physical significance of the
parameters of these models, in particular exploring whether the model provides
a better description if the mass loading of the galactic winds generated by
starbursts ($\beta_{0,\text{burst}}$) and quiescent disks
($\beta_{0,\text{disc}}$) is different. Performing a principal component
analysis of the plausible volume of the parameter space, we write a set of

by GSMF evolution data, constraints on $\beta_{0,\text{burst}}$ are weak.
Although it is possible to find plausible models for which
$\beta_{0,\text{burst}} = \beta_{0,\text{disc}}$, most plausible models have

These systems are micron sized or even smaller and they are subjected to laud
thermal fluctuations. Thus one needs to study the behavior of such systems in
terms of these fluctuations. Average thermodynamic quantities like work done,
heat exchanged, efficiency loose meaning unless otherwise supported by their

on a single parameter namely the phase between two external drivings. We study
this system in terms of fluctuations in efficiency and coefficient of

combination of perturbation and computational analyses is used to provide a
unified quantification of these shifts in layered dielectrics with two parallel
interfaces. The approach is then extended to consider the qualitatively new
behavior that results when the light is endowed with an intrinsic orbital
angular momentum--i.e. vortex beams. Destructive interference causes singular
lateral shifts in the centroid of the reflected vortex beam for which spin
alone produces only a mild modulation. In the case of total internal
reflection, both spin and intrinsic orbital angular momentum contribute to an
enhancement of these lateral shifts as the interlayer thickness is decreased.
This is just the opposite of the trend associated with longitudinal shifts. Two

linear parameter varying (LPV) systems. The approach is based on decoupling the
original dynamics into smaller dimensional LPV subsystems that can be
independently reduced by parameter varying reduction methods. The decomposition
starts with the construction of a modal transformation that separates the modal
subsystems. Hierarchical clustering is applied then to collect the dynamically
similar modal subsystems into larger groups. The subsystems formed from the
groups are then independently reduced. This approach substantially differs from
most of the previously proposed LPV model reduction techniques, since it
performs manipulations on the LPV model and not on a set of linear
time-invariant (LTI) models defined at fixed scheduling parameter values.
Therefore the model interpolation, which is the most challenging part of most
reduction techniques, is avoided. The applicability of the developed algorithm
is thoroughly investigated and demonstrated by numerical case studies.

Potsdam is both a landmark of modern architecture and an important place for
solar physics. Originally built for high-resolution spectroscopy and measuring
the gravitational redshift, research shifted over the years to understanding
the active Sun and its magnetic field. Nowadays, telescope and spectrographs
are used for research and development, i.e., testing instruments and in
particular polarization optics for advanced instrumentation deployed at major
European and international astronomical and solar telescopes. In addition, the
Einstein Tower is used for educating and training of the next generation
astrophysicists as well as for education and public outreach activities
directed at the general public. This article comments on the observatory's
unique architecture and the challenges of maintaining and conserving the
building. It describes in detail the characteristics of telescope,
spectrographs, and imagers; it portrays some of the research and development
activities.

the period is well sampled at near-infrared (NIR)-optical by the \emph{SMARTS}
facility and the source is detected continuously on daily timescale in the
\emph{Fermi}-LAT $\gamma$-ray band. The source exhibits diverse levels of
variability with many flaring/active states in the continuously sampled
$\gamma$-ray light curve which are also reflected in the NIR-optical light
curves and the sparsely sampled X-ray light curve by the \emph{Swift}-XRT.
Multi-band correlation analysis of this continuous segment during different
activity periods shows a change of state from no lags between IR and
$\gamma$-ray, optical and $\gamma$-ray, and IR and optical to a state where
$\gamma$-ray lags the IR/optical by $\sim$3 days. The results are consistent
with the previous studies of the same during various $\gamma$-ray flaring and
active episodes of the source. This consistency, in turn, suggests an extended
localized emission region with almost similar conditions during various
$\gamma$-ray activity states. On the other hand, the delay of $\gamma$-ray with
respect to IR/optical and a trend similar to IR/optical in X-rays along with
strong broadband correlations favor magnetic field related origin with X-ray
and $\gamma$-ray being inverse Comptonized of IR/optical photons and external
radiation field, respectively.

tailored for nonexpansive mappings which makes it possible to include steps
along any direction. In particular, when the directions satisfy a Dennis-Mor\'e

enhances and robustifies all operator splitting schemes for structured convex

favorite in the study of condensed matter physics. Massive Rarita-Schwinger
3/2-spinor was known owning very exotic properties, such as the superluminal
fermionic modes and even being unstable in an external magnetic field. Due to
the superluminal modes and the non-trivial constraints on the Rarita-Schwinger
gas, we exposit anomalous properties of the Hall effects in (2+1)-dimensions
which subvert the well-known quantum Hall paradigms. First, the Hall
conductance of a pure Rarita-Schwinger gas is step-like but not
plateau-quantized, instead of the linear dependence on the filling factor for a
pure spin-1/2 Dirac gas. In reality, the Hall conductance of the Dirac gas is
of quantized integer plateaus with the unit $\frac{e^2}h$ due to the
localization away from the Landau level centers. If the general localization
rule is applicable to the disordered Rarita-Schwinger gas, the Hall plateaus
are also expected to appear but they are nonlinearly dependent on the Landau
level index. Furthermore, there is a critical magnetic field beyond which
higher Landau levels become unstable. This confines the filling factor of the
system. We also show that the non-hermitness of the effective Hamiltonian is
not crucial to the nonlinearity of the quantum Hall conductance.

well-covered graphs, called localizable graphs and defined as graphs having a
partition of the vertex set into strong cliques, where a clique in a graph is
strong if it intersects all maximal independent sets. Yamashita and Kameda
observed that all well-covered trees are localizable, pointed out that the
converse inclusion fails in general, and asked for a characterization of

  In this paper we obtain several structural and algorithmic results about
localizable graphs. Our results include a proof of the fact that every very
well-covered graph is localizable and characterizations of localizable graphs
within the classes of line graphs, triangle-free graphs, $C_4$-free graphs, and
cubic graphs, each leading to a polynomial time recognition algorithm. On the

the classes of weakly chordal graphs, complements of line graphs, and graphs of

societies and it is only recently that the availability of massive amounts of
geolocalized historical data allows us to address quantitatively some of its
features. Here, we discuss how the number of buildings evolves with population
and we show on different datasets (Chicago, $1930-2010$; London, $1900-2015$;
New York City, $1790-2013$; Paris, $1861-2011$) that this `fundamental diagram'
evolves in a possibly universal way with three distinct phases. After an
initial pre-urbanization phase, the first phase is a rapid growth of the number
of buildings versus population. In a second regime, where residences are
converted into another use (such as offices or stores for example), the
population decreases while the number of buildings stays approximatively
constant. In another subsequent phase, the number of buildings and the
population grow again and correspond to a re-densification of cities. We
propose a stochastic model based on these simple mechanisms to reproduce the
first two regimes and show that it is in excellent agreement with empirical
observations. These results bring evidences for the possibility of constructing
a minimal model that could serve as a tool for understanding quantitatively
urbanization and the future evolution of cities.

of local states in a large but finite system. The result is essentially that of
Brandao and Cramer (here restricted to the case of the canonical and the

multi-agent systems: average consensus. In this scenario, a group of agents
seek to agree on the average of their initial states. Depending on the
particular application, such states might correspond to sensor measurements,
estimates about the position of a target, or some other data that needs to be
fused. Due to its numerous applications in networked systems, many algorithmic
solutions exist to the multi-agent average consensus problem; however, a
majority of them rely on agents having continuous or periodic availability of
information from other agents. Unfortunately, this assumption leads to
inefficient implementations in terms of energy consumption, communication
bandwidth, network congestion, and processor usage. Motivated by these
observations, our main goal here is the design of provably correct distributed
event-triggered strategies that autonomously decide when communication and
control updates should occur so that the resulting asynchronous network
executions still achieve average consensus.

Lenses (FCLs) in myopic eyes by means of a two-dimensional Relative Peripheral
Refractive Error (RPRE) map.
  Methods: FCLs prototypes were specially manufactured and characterized. This
study involved twenty-six myopic subjects ranging from -0.50 D to -7.00 D. The
two-dimensional RPRE was measured with an open-field autorefractor by means of
tracking targets distributed in a square grid from -30 degrees (deg) nasal to
30 deg temporal and 15 deg superior to -15 deg inferior. Corneal topographies
were taken in order to assess correlations between corneal asphericity, lens
decentration and RPRE represented in vector components M, J0 and J45.
  Results: The mean power of the FCLs therapeutic zones was 1.32 +/- 0.28 D.
Significant correlations were found between the corneal asphericity and vector
components of the RPRE in the nacked eyes. FCLs were decentered a mean of 0.7
+/- 0.19 mm to the temporal cornea. M decreased asymmetrically between nasal
and temporal retina after fitting the FCLs with a significant increment of the
myopic shift besides 10 deg (p<0.05) and the induced myopic shift at 25 deg and
30 deg decreased with FCLs decentration to temporal cornea. The peak of maximum
myopic shift at the peripheral retina (M= -1.3 D) was located at 20 deg.
Two-dimensional maps showed uniform significant differences in extreme
positions of the visual field in comparison with the horizontal RPRE for M and
J0, but not for J45.
  Conclusions: FCLs measured in myopic eyes showed a similar performance than
the reported in previous ray-tracing studies with a small bias explained by the
manufacturing process and the lens decentration. Two-dimensional maps are
preferable for assessing J45 changes due to the lens.

the current upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r < 0.07$ $(95 \%

\eta$, and therefore establishes the existence of a new hierarchy. We dub this
regime the conformal limit of (slow-roll) inflation, and show that it includes
Starobinsky-like inflation as well as all viable single-field models with a
sub-Planckian field excursion. In this limit, all primordial correlators are
constrained by the full conformal group to leading non-trivial order in
slow-roll. This fixes the power spectrum and the full bispectrum, and leads to
the ""conformal"" shape of non-Gaussianity. The size of non-Gaussianity is
related to the running of the spectral index by a consistency condition, and
therefore it is expected to be small. In passing, we clarify the role of
boundary terms in the $\zeta$ action, the order to which constraint equations

that there is negligible disturbance to the marginal state on the $BE$ systems,
while the system $A$ of the resulting state is locally recoverable from the $E$

protocols implementing them as state deconstruction protocols. State
deconstruction generalizes Landauer erasure of a single-party quantum state as
well the erasure of correlations of a two-party quantum state. We find that the
deconstruction cost of a tripartite quantum state on systems $ABE$ is equal to
its conditional quantum mutual information (CQMI) $I(A;B|E)$, thus giving the
CQMI an operational interpretation in terms of a state deconstruction protocol.
We also define a related task called conditional erasure, in which the goal is
to apply noise to systems $AE$ in order to decouple system $A$ from systems
$BE$, while causing negligible disturbance to the marginal state of systems
$BE$. We find that the optimal rate of noise for conditional erasure is also
equal to the CQMI $I(A;B|E)$. State deconstruction and conditional erasure lead
to operational interpretations of the quantum discord and squashed
entanglement, which are quantum correlation measures based on the CQMI. We find
that the quantum discord is equal to the cost of simulating einselection, the
process by which a quantum system interacts with an environment, resulting in
selective loss of information in the system. The squashed entanglement is equal
to half the minimum rate of noise needed for deconstruction/conditional erasure
if Alice has available the best possible system $E$ to help in the

promising candidate for thin-film photovoltaics. On 10 \mu m thin absorbers,
wafer-equivalent morphologies and open-circuit voltages were reached, leading
to a record efficiency of 12.1%. However, short-circuit current densities are
still limited, mainly due to optical losses at the glass-silicon interface.
While nano-structures at this interface have been shown to efficiently reduce
reflection, up to now these textures caused an increase in recombination.
Therefore, optical gains were mitigated due to electronic losses. Here, the
SMooth Anti-Reflective Three-dimensional (SMART) texture is introduced in order
to overcome this trade-off. By smoothing nanoimprinted SiOx nano-pillar arrays
with spin-coated TiOx layers, light-trapping properties of laser-crystallized
silicon solar cells could significantly be improved as successfully shown in
three-dimensional simulations and in experiment. At the same time, the smooth
surface morphology of SMART textures allows preserving electronic material
quality equivalent to that of planar reference samples and reaching Voc values
above 640 mV in 8 \mu m thin liquid-phase crystallized silicon solar cells.
Furthermore, the short-circuit current density jsc could be increased from 21.0

interlayer stacks to 23.3 mA cm-2 on SMART textures, corresponding to a
relative increase of 11%.

In this work, we study endoglucanase Cel8A, which is a relevant enzymatic
component of the cellulosomes of Clostridium thermocellum. We use both all-atom
and coarse-grained simulations to investigate how the equilibrium conformations
of the catalytic domain of Cel8A are affected by the disordered linker at its C

effective stiffness of the linker can influence the distances between groups of
amino-acid residues throughout the entire enzymatic domain. In particular,

computationally expensive. Hence, we adopt a reactive potential field approach

relative to the closest obstacle point to find the potential field in the

to scale up for multiple agent scenarios. Our main contribution here is to
write the reactive potential field based motion controller as a hybrid

logic. In particular, we can guarantee a passive safety property, which means
that collisions cannot occur if the robot is to blame, namely a collision can
occur only if the robot is at rest. The proposed controller and verification
results are demonstrated via simulations and implementation on a Pioneer P3-AT

magnetization rotation provides the sign of $Q$ independently of the sign of
the effective spin polarization in the tunnel junction. We also discuss cases

  equilibria","27 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent work, Renaud, Venaille, and Bouchet (RVB) revisit the equilibrium
statistical mechanics theory of the shallow water equations, within a
microcanonical approach, focusing on a more careful treatment of the energy
partition between inertial gravity wave and eddy motions in the equilibrium
state, and deriving joint probability distributions for the corresponding
dynamical degrees of freedom. The authors derive a Liouville theorem that
determines the underlying phase space statistical measure, but then, through
some physical arguments, actually compute the equilibrium statistics using a
measure that \emph{violates} this theorem. Here, using a more convenient, but
essentially equivalent, grand canonical approach, the full statistical theory
consistent with the Liouville theorem is derived. The results reveal several
significant differences from the previous results: (1) The microscale wave
motions lead to a strongly fluctuating thermodynamics, including long-ranged
correlations, in contrast to the mean-field-like behavior found by RVB. The
final effective model is equivalent to that of an elastic membrane with a
nonlinear wave-renormalized surface tension. (2) Even when a mean field
approximation is made, a rather more complex joint probability distribution is
revealed. Alternative physical arguments fully support the consistency of the
results. Of course, the true fluid final steady state relies on dissipative
processes not included in the shallow water equations, such as wave breaking
and viscous effects, but it is argued that the current theory provides a more
mathematically consistent starting point for future work aimed at assessing
their impacts.

  bibliography",,,,"cs.IT cs.CR math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the classical model for (information theoretically secure) Private
Information Retrieval (PIR), a user wishes to retrieve one bit of a database
that is stored on a set of $n$ servers, in such a way that no individual server
gains information about which bit the user is interested in. The aim is to
design schemes that minimise communication between the user and the servers.
More recently, there have been moves to consider more realistic models where
the total storage of the set of servers, or the per server storage, should be
minimised (possibly using techniques from distributed storage), and where the
database is divided into $R$-bit records with $R>1$, and the user wishes to
retrieve one record rather than one bit. When $R$ is large, downloads from the
servers to the user dominate the communication complexity and so the aim is to
minimise the total number of downloaded bits. Shah, Rashmi and Ramchandran show
that at least $R+1$ bits must be downloaded from servers in the worst case, and
provide PIR schemes meeting this bound. Sun and Jafar determine the best
asymptotic download cost of a PIR scheme (as $R\rightarrow\infty$), where this
cost is defined as the ratio of the message length $R$ and the total number of
bits downloaded.
  This paper provides various bounds on the download complexity of a PIR
scheme, generalising those of Shah et al. to the case when the number $n$ of
servers is bounded, and providing links with classical techniques due to Chor
et al. The paper also provides a range of constructions for PIR schemes that
are either simpler or perform better than previously known schemes, including
explicit schemes that achieve the best asymptotic download complexity of Sun
and Jafar with significantly lower upload complexity, and general techniques
for constructing a scheme with good worst case download complexity from a
scheme with good download complexity on average.

ingredient in a number of models from economics and the natural sciences. Many
SPDEs that appear in such applications include non-globally monotone

are in nearly all cases not known explicitly. Such SPDEs can thus only be
solved approximatively and it is an important research problem to construct and
analyze discrete numerical approximation schemes which converge with positive
strong convergence rates to the solutions of such infinite dimensional SPDEs.
In the case of finite dimensional stochastic ordinary differential equations
(SODEs) with non-globally monotone nonlinearities it has recently been revealed
that exponential integrability properties of the discrete numerical
approximation scheme are a key instrument to establish positive strong
convergence rates for the considered approximation scheme. To the best of our

exponential integrability properties for a time discrete approximation scheme

class of tamed space-time-noise discrete exponential Euler approximation
schemes that admit exponential integrability properties in the case of infinite
dimensional SPDEs. In particular, we establish exponential moment bounds for
the proposed approximation schemes in the case of stochastic Burgers equations,

the readers are interested in only the important context of discussions. In
this work, we address the task of meeting document summarization. Automatic
summarization systems on meeting conversations developed so far have been
primarily extractive, resulting in unacceptable summaries that are hard to
read. The extracted utterances contain disfluencies that affect the quality of
the extractive summaries. To make summaries much more readable, we propose an
approach to generating abstractive summaries by fusing important content from
several utterances. We first separate meeting transcripts into various topic
segments, and then identify the important utterances in each segment using a
supervised learning approach. The important utterances are then combined
together to generate a one-sentence summary. In the text generation step, the
dependency parses of the utterances in each segment are combined together to
create a directed graph. The most informative and well-formed sub-graph
obtained by integer linear programming (ILP) is selected to generate a
one-sentence summary for each topic segment. The ILP formulation reduces
disfluencies by leveraging grammatical relations that are more prominent in
non-conversational style of text, and therefore generates summaries that is
comparable to human-written abstractive summaries. Experimental results show
that our method can generate more informative summaries than the baselines. In
addition, readability assessments by human judges as well as log-likelihood
estimates obtained from the dependency parser show that our generated summaries
are significantly readable and well-formed.

indirect nature of the bandgap explains the apparent contradiction of strong

ordering of the crystal structure. The nature of the bandgap becomes
increasingly more direct, resulting in five times faster charge carrier

in a purely direct bandgap semiconductor. The pressure-induced changes suggest
epitaxial and synthetic routes to higher efficiency optoelectronic devices.

expense of processing videos. Since the frame-wise feature mean is unable to
characterize the pose diversity among frames, we define and preserve the
overall pose diversity and closeness in a video. Then, identity will be the
only source of variation across videos since the pose varies even within a
single video. Instead of simply using all the frames, we select those faces
whose pose point is closest to the centroid of the K-means cluster containing
that pose point. Then, we represent a video as a bag of frame-wise deep face
features while the number of features has been reduced from hundreds to K.
Since the video representation can well represent the identity, now we measure
the subject similarity between two videos as the max correlation among all
possible pairs in the two bags of features. On the official 5,000 video-pairs
of the YouTube Face dataset for face verification, our algorithm achieves a
comparable performance with VGG-face that averages over deep features of all
frames. Other vision tasks can also benefit from the generic idea of employing
geometric cues to improve the descriptiveness of deep features.

construct a dataset of 16,242 molecules, whose electronic ground state energies
have been computed using density functional theory. This dataset is used to
train the boosted regression tree algorithm, which allows a computationally
efficient and accurate prediction of molecular ground state energies.
Predictions from boosted regression trees are compared with neural network
regression, a widely used method in the literature, and shown to be more

the voltage deviations caused by the primary droop control, where the latter is
implemented locally in each distributed generator and reacts to load
variations. Numerous recent works propose to implement the secondary control in
a distributed fashion, relying on a communication system to achieve consensus
among MG units. This paper shows that, if the system is not designed to cope
with adversary communication impairments, then a malicious attacker can apply a
simple jamming of a few units of the MG and thus compromise the secondary MG
control. Compared to other denial-of-service attacks that are oriented against
the tertiary control, such as economic dispatch, the attack on the secondary
control presented here can be more severe, as it disrupts the basic

wide research interest. The characterization these emerging atomically thin
materials and devices strongly relies on a set of measurements involving both
optical and electronic instrumentation ranging from scanning photocurrent
mapping to Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Furthermore,
proof-of-concept devices are usually fabricated from micro-meter size flakes,
requiring microscopy techniques to characterize them. Current state-of-the-art
commercial instruments offer the ability to characterize individual properties
of these materials with no option for the in situ characterization of a wide
enough range of complementary optical and electrical properties. Presently, the
requirement to switch atomically-thin materials from one system to another
often radically affects the properties of these uniquely sensitive materials
through atmospheric contamination. Here, we present an integrated,
multi-purpose instrument dedicated to the optical and electrical
characterization of devices based on 2D materials which is able to perform low
frequency electrical measurements, scanning photocurrent mapping, Raman,
absorption and PL spectroscopy in one single set-up. We characterize this
apparatus by performing multiple measurements on graphene, transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) and Si. The performance and resolution of each
individual measurement technique is found to be equivalent to that of
commercially available instruments. Contrary to nowadays commercial systems, a
significant advantage of the developed instrument is that for the first time
the integration of a wide range of complementary opto-electronic and
spectroscopy characterization techniques is demonstrated in a single compact

common terminologies and their relationships during SLR processes; second, we
present an extended version of SLRONT, the COSONT and instantiate it with the

Results show that through using COSONT, we acquire the same conclusion compared

valid physical theories have to satisfy. In the reversible transformation
between superconducting and normal phases in the presence of a magnetic field,
the mechanical momentum of the supercurrent has to be transferred to the body
as a whole and vice versa, the kinetic energy of the supercurrent stays in the
electronic degrees of freedom, and no energy is dissipated nor entropy is
generated in the process. We argue on general grounds that to explain these
processes it is necessary that the electromagnetic field mediates the transfer
of momentum between electrons and the body as a whole, and this requires that
when the phase boundary between normal and superconducting phases is displaced,
a flow and counterflow of charge occurs in direction perpendicular to the phase
boundary. This flow and counterflow does not occur according to the
conventional BCS-London theory of superconductivity, therefore we argue that
within BCS-London theory the Meissner transition is a `forbidden transition'.
Furthermore, to explain the phase transformation in a way that is consistent
with the experimental observations requires that (i) the wavefunction $and$
charge distribution of superconducting electrons near the phase boundary extend
into the normal phase, and (ii) that the charge carriers in the normal state
have hole-like character. The conventional theory of superconductivity does not
have these physical elements, the theory of hole superconductivity does.

dynamic Boltzmann machines (DyBM). The recently introduced DyBM provides a
particularly structured Boltzmann machine, as a generative model of a
multi-dimensional time-series. This Boltzmann machine can have infinitely many
layers of units but allows exact inference and learning based on its
biologically motivated structure. DyBM uses the idea of conduction delays in
the form of fixed length first-in first-out (FIFO) queues, with a neuron
connected to another via this FIFO queue, and spikes from a pre-synaptic neuron
travel along the queue to the post-synaptic neuron with a constant period of
delay. Here, we present Delay Pruning as a mechanism to prune the lengths of
the FIFO queues (making them zero) by setting some delay lengths to one with a
fixed probability, and finally selecting the best performing model with fixed
delays. The uniqueness of structure and a non-sampling based learning rule in
DyBM, make the application of previously proposed regularization techniques
like Dropout or DropConnect difficult, leading to poor generalization. First,
we evaluate the performance of Delay Pruning to let DyBM learn a
multidimensional temporal sequence generated by a Markov chain. Finally, we
show the effectiveness of delay pruning in learning high dimensional sequences
using the moving MNIST dataset, and compare it with Dropout and DropConnect
methods.
