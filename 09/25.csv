sterile neutrinos and their effective mixing angles valid in a wide range of
temperature, to all orders in interactions of the standard model, and to
leading order mixing angle $\theta \ll 1$.
  Production rates and effective mixing angles depend sensitively on helicity.
Positive helicity states interact more weakly with the medium and their
effective mixing angle is not modified significantly whereas the mixing angle
for negative helicity is strongly suppressed by the medium.
  If $M_s \lesssim 8.35\,\mathrm{MeV}$, there are fewer states with negative
helicity produced than those with positive helicity. There is an MSW resonance
in the absence of lepton asymmetry, but is screened by the damping rate,
without production enhancement. Negative helicity states freeze-out at
$T^-_f\simeq 5\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and positive helicity states freeze-out at $T^+_f

helicity states feature a broader momentum distribution than that for those

not satisfy the abundance, lifetime and cosmological constraints to be the sole
dark matter component in the universe but might solve the $^{7}Li$ problem,
albeit at the very edge of the possible parameter space. A heavy sterile

extensive presence of focal axonal swellings (FAS). FAS compromises the
information encoded in spike trains, thus leading to potentially severe
functional deficits. Complicating our understanding of the impact of FAS is our
inability to access small scale injuries with non-invasive methods, the overall
complexity of neuronal pathologies, and our limited knowledge of how networks
process biological signals. Building on Hopfield's pioneering work, we extend a
model for associative memory to account for FAS and its impact on memory
encoding. We calibrate all FAS parameters from biophysical observations of
their statistical distribution and size, providing a framework to simulate the
effects of brain disorders on memory recall performance. A face recognition
example is used to demonstrate and validate the functionality of the novel
model. Our results link memory recall ability to observed FAS statistics,
allowing for a description of different stages of brain disorders within
neuronal networks. This provides a first theoretical model to bridge
experimental observations of FAS in neurodegeneration and TBI with compromised
memory recall, thus closing the large gap between theory and experiment on how

quantum embedding theory for computing non-equilibrium electron dynamics in
strongly correlated systems. As in the previously developed static DMET,
real-time DMET partitions the system into an impurity corresponding to the
region of interest coupled to the surrounding environment, which is efficiently
represented by a quantum bath of the same size as the impurity. In this work,
we focus on a single-impurity time-dependent theory as a first step towards a
full multi-impurity theory. The equations of motion of the coupled impurity and
bath embedding problem in real-time DMET are then derived using the
time-dependent variational principle. The accuracy of real-time DMET is
compared to that of time-dependent complete active space self-consistent field
(TD-CASSCF) theory and time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory for a variety
of quantum quenches in the single impurity Anderson model (SIAM), in which the
Hamiltonian is suddenly changed (quenched) to induce a non-equilibrium state.
Real-time DMET shows a marked improvement over the meanfield TDHF, converging
to the exact answer even in the non-trivial Kondo regime of the SIAM. However,
as in static DMET, the increased dynamic flexibility of TD-CASSCF in comparison
to real-time DMET using a single impurity leads to faster convergence with
respect to active space size. Our results demonstrate that real-time DMET is an
efficient method well suited for the simulation of non-equilibrium electron
dynamics in which strong electron correlation plays an important role.

concentration of initial DNA strands. During iterations the numbers increase,
first essentially by doubling, later predominantly in a linear way. Observation
of the number of DNA molecules in the experiment becomes possible only when it
is substantially larger than initial numbers, and then possibly affected by the
randomness in individual replication. Can the initial copy number still be
determined?
  This is a classical problem and, indeed, a concrete special case of the
general problem of determining the number of ancestors, mutants or invaders, of
a population observed only later. We approach it through a generalised version
of the branching process model introduced by Jagers and Klebaner, 2003 and
based on Michaelis-Menten type enzyme kinetical considerations from Schnell and
Mendoza, 1997. A crucial role is played by the Michaelis-Menten constant being
large, as compared to initial copy numbers. In a strange way, determination of
the initial number turns out to be completely possible if the initial rate $v$
is one, i.e all DNA strands replicate, but only partly so when $v<1$, and thus
the initial rate or probability of successful replication is lower than one.
Then, the starting molecule number becomes hidden behind a ""veil of
uncertainty"". This is a special case, of a hitherto unobserved general
phenomenon in population growth processes, which will be addressed elsewhere.

nights since installation in 2012. MagAO's unique capabilities are simultaneous
imaging in the visible and infrared with VisAO and Clio, excellent performance
at an excellent site, and a lean operations model. Science results from MagAO
include the first ground-based CCD image of an exoplanet, demonstration of the
first accreting protoplanets, discovery of a new wide-orbit exoplanet, and the
first empirical bolometric luminosity of an exoplanet. We describe the status,
report the AO performance, and summarize the science results. New developments
reported here include color corrections on red guide stars for the wavefront

induced by admissible team policies in decentralized stochastic control and the
convexity properties in dynamic team problems. To facilitate a convex
analytical approach, strategic measures for team problems are introduced.
Properties such as convexity, and compactness and Borel measurability under
weak convergence topology are studied, and sufficient conditions for each of
these properties are presented. These lead to existence of and structural
results for optimal policies. It will be shown that the set of strategic
measures for teams which are not classical is in general non-convex, but the
extreme points of a relaxed set consist of deterministic team policies, which
lead to their optimality for a given team problem under an expected cost
criterion. Externally provided independent common randomness for static teams
or private randomness for dynamic teams do not improve the team performance.
The problem of when a sequential team problem is convex is studied and
necessary and sufficient conditions for problems which include teams with a
non-classical information structure are presented. Implications of this
analysis in identifying probability and information structure dependent
convexity properties are presented.

and the thermal cloud at finite temperature consists of a nonlinear Schrodinger
(NLS) and a quantum Boltzmann (QB) equations. In such a system of trapped Bose
gases at finite temperature, the QB equation corresponds to the evolution of
the density distribution function of the thermal cloud and the NLS is the
equation of the condensate. The quantum Boltzmann collision operator in this
temperature regime is the sum of two operators $C_{12}$ and $C_{22}$, which
describe collisions of the condensate and the non-condenstate atoms and
collisions between non-condensate atoms. Above the BEC critical temperature,
the system is reduced to an equation containing only $C_{22}$, which possesses
a blow-up positive radial solution with respect to the $L^\infty$ norm (cf.
\cite{EscobedoVelazquez:2015:FTB}). On the other hand, at the very low
temperature regime, the system becomes an equation of $C_{12}$, with a
different (much higher order) transition probability, which has a unique global
positive radial solution with weighted $L^1$ norm (cf. \cite{AlonsoGambaBinh}).
In the current temperature regime, we first decouple the QB and NLS equations,
then show a global existence and uniqueness result for positive radial
solutions to the spatially homogeneous kinetic system. Different from the case
considered in \cite{EscobedoVelazquez:2015:FTB}, due to the presence of the
BEC, the collision integrals are associated to sophisticated energy manifolds
rather than spheres, since the particle energy is approximated by the
Bogoliubov dispersion law. Moreover, the mass of the full system is not
conserved while it is conserved for the case considered in
\cite{EscobedoVelazquez:2015:FTB}. A new theory is then supplied.

in the study of biochemical reaction networks in living cells. It is applied
when the spatial distribution of molecules is important to the dynamics of the
system. A viable approach to resolve the complex geometry of cells accurately
is to discretize space with an unstructured mesh. Diffusion is modeled as
discrete jumps between nodes on the mesh, and the diffusion jump rates can be
obtained through a discretization of the diffusion equation on the mesh.
Reactions can occur when molecules occupy the same voxel. In this paper, we
develop a method for computing accurate reaction rates between molecules
occupying the same voxel in an unstructured mesh. For large voxels, these rates
are known to be well approximated by the reaction rates derived by Collins and
Kimball, but as the mesh is refined, no analytical expression for the rates
exists. We reduce the problem of computing accurate reaction rates to a pure
preprocessing step, depending only on the mesh and not on the model parameters,
and we devise an efficient numerical scheme to estimate them to high accuracy.
We show in several numerical examples that as we refine the mesh, the results
obtained with the reaction-diffusion master equation approach those of a more
fine-grained Smoluchowski particle-tracking model.

of normalizing constants of two probability densities, a routine computational
problem in statistics, physics, chemistry, and other fields. The Monte Carlo
error of the bridge sampling estimator is determined by the amount of overlap
between the two densities. In the case of uni-modal densities, Warp-I, II, and
III transformations (Meng and Schilling, 2002) are effective for increasing the
initial overlap, but they are less so for multi-modal densities. This paper
introduces Warp-U transformations that aim to transform multi-modal densities
into Uni-modal ones without altering their normalizing constants. The
construction of a Warp-U transformation starts with a Normal (or other
convenient) mixture distribution $\phi_{\text{mix}}$ that has reasonable
overlap with the target density $p$, whose normalizing constant is unknown. The
stochastic transformation that maps $\phi_{\text{mix}}$ back to its generating
distribution $N(0,1)$ is then applied to $p$ yielding its Warp-U version, which
we denote $\tilde{p}$. Typically, $\tilde{p}$ is uni-modal and has
substantially increased overlap with $N(0,1)$. Furthermore, we prove that the
overlap between $\tilde{p}$ and $N(0,1)$ is guaranteed to be no less than the
overlap between $p$ and $\phi_{\text{mix}}$, in terms of any $f$-divergence. We
propose a computationally efficient method to find an appropriate
$\phi_{\text{mix}}$, and a simple but effective approach to remove the bias
which results from estimating the normalizing constants and fitting
$\phi_{\text{mix}}$ with the same data. We illustrate our findings using 10 and
50 dimensional highly irregular multi-modal densities, and demonstrate how
Warp-U sampling can be used to improve the final estimation step of the
Generalized Wang-Landau algorithm (Liang, 2005), a powerful sampling and
estimation method.

represent elliptic flow. Jet angular correlations may also contribute to $v_2$
data as ""nonflow"" depending on the method used to calculate $v_2$, but 2D

quadrupole has various properties inconsistent with a flow interpretation,
including the observation that NJ quadrupole centrality variation in A-A
collisions has no relation to strongly-varying jet modification (""jet
quenching"") in those collisions commonly attributed to jet interaction with a
flowing dense medium. In this presentation I describe isolation of quadrupole
spectra from pt-differential $v_2(p_t)$ data from the RHIC and LHC. I
demonstrate that quadrupole spectra have characteristics very different from
the single-particle spectra for most hadrons, that quadrupole spectra indicate
a common boosted hadron source for a small minority of hadrons that ""carry"" the
NJ quadrupole structure, that the narrow source-boost distribution is
characteristic of an expanding thin cylindrical shell (strongly contradicting
hydro descriptions), and that in the boost frame a single universal quadrupole
spectrum (L\'evy distribution) on transverse mass $m_t$ accurately describes
data for several hadron species scaled according to their statistical-model
abundances. The quadrupole spectrum shape changes very little from RHIC to LHC
energies. Taken in combination those characteristics strongly suggest a unique
{\em nonflow} (and nonjet) QCD mechanism for the NJ quadrupole conventionally
represented by $v_2$.

strategy using standard operator semigroup-theoretic arguments. We show that
the diffusion coefficient can be chosen to be dependent only on the robots'
local measurements to ensure that the swarm density converges to a function
proportional to the scalar field. The boundedness of the domain precludes the
need to impose assumptions on decaying properties of the scalar field at
infinity. Moreover, exponential convergence of the swarm density to the
equilibrium follows from properties of the spectrum of the semigroup generator.
In addition, we use the proposed coverage method to construct a
time-inhomogenous diffusion process and apply the observability of the heat
equation to reconstruct the scalar field over the entire domain from
observations of the robots' random motion over a small subset of the domain. We
verify our results through simulations of the coverage scenario on a 2D domain

represent brightenings in the conjunction region of several loops that are also
related to a bright region (granular lane) in the H$\alpha$-35km/s and
H$\alpha$+35 km/s images. Sixteen are general loop brightenings that do not

features clearly seen in the H$\alpha$-35 km/s images. We found that
chromospheric events with jet-like appearance seen in the wings of the
H$\alpha$ line can trigger EEs in the transition region and in this case the
IRIS Si IV 1394\AA\ line profiles are seeded with absorption components
resulting from Fe II and Ni II. Our study indicates that EEs occurring in
active regions have mostly upper-chromosphere/transition-region origin. We
suggest that magnetic reconnection resulting from the braidings of small-scale
transition region loops is one of the possible mechanisms of energy release
that are responsible for the EEs reported in this paper.

between the points then the answer is a pair of balls of equal radius, one
centered at each of the two points, but otherwise it is a certain domain of
revolution about the axis passing through the two points. The existence and
uniqueness of such a domain is known, but an explicit parameterization is known
only in the plane where the region is referred to as a Neumann oval. We
construct a four-dimensional ""Neumann ovaloid"", solving explicitly this inverse

(SCN), the coverage probability performance will continuously decrease with the
network densification. Such new results were captured in IEEE ComSoc Technology
News with an alarming title of ""Will Densification Be the Death of 5G?"". In
this paper, we revisit this issue from more practical views of realistic
network deployment, such as a finite number of active base stations (BSs) and
user equipments (UEs), a decreasing BS transmission power with the network
densification, etc. Particularly, in dense SCNs, due to an oversupply of BSs
with respect to UEs, a large number of BSs can be put into idle modes without
signal transmission, if there is no active UE within their coverage areas.
Setting those BSs into idle modes mitigates unnecessary inter-cell interference
and reduces energy consumption. In this paper, we investigate the performance
impact of such BS idle mode capability (IMC) on dense SCNs. Different from
existing work, we consider a realistic path loss model incorporating both
line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmissions. Moreover, we
obtain analytical results for the coverage probability, the area spectral
efficiency (ASE) and the energy efficiency (EE) performance for SCNs with the
BS IMC and show that the performance impact of the IMC on dense SCNs is
significant. As the BS density surpasses the UE density in dense SCNs, the
coverage probability will continuously increase toward one, addressing previous
concerns on ""the death of 5G"". Finally, the performance improvement in terms of
the EE performance is also investigated for dense SCNs using practical energy
models developed in the Green-Touch project.

  Methods from geostatistics and statistical emulation are used to explicitly

white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with a transmit power constraint, where the
signaling rate of communication is larger than the sampling rate (for
generating observations and applying control inputs) of the underlying plant.
Such a situation is quite common since sampling is done at a rate that captures
the dynamics of the plant and which is often much lower than the rate that can
be communicated. This setting offers the opportunity of improving the system
performance by employing multiple channel uses to convey a single message
(output plant observation or control input). Common ways of doing so are
through either repeating the message, or by quantizing it to a number of bits
and then transmitting a channel coded version of the bits whose length is
commensurate with the number of channel uses per sampled message. We argue that
such ""separated source and channel coding"" can be suboptimal and propose to
perform joint source-channel coding. Since the block length is short we obviate
the need to go to the digital domain altogether and instead consider analog
joint source-channel coding. For the case where the communication signaling
rate is twice the sampling rate, we employ the Archimedean bi-spiral-based
Shannon-Kotel'nikov analog maps to show significant improvement in stability
margins and linear-quadratic Gaussian (LQG) costs over simple schemes that

near an exceptional point where two eigenstates coalesce should generally
exhibit an evolution $P(t) \sim t^2 e^{-\Gamma t}$, in which $\Gamma$ is the
decay rate of the coalesced eigenstate; this has been verified in a microwave
billiard experiment [B. Dietz, et al, Phys. Rev. E 75, 027201 (2007)]. However,
the heuristic effective Hamiltonian that is usually employed to obtain this
result ignores the possible influence of the continuum threshold on the
dynamics. By contrast, in this work we employ an analytical approach starting
from the microscopic Hamiltonian representing two simple models in order to
show that the continuum threshold has a strong influence on the dynamics near
exceptional points in a variety of circumstances. To report our results, we
divide the exceptional points in Hermitian open quantum systems into two cases:
at an EP2A two virtual bound states coalesce before forming a resonance,
anti-resonance pair with complex conjugate eigenvalues, while at an EP2B two
resonances coalesce before forming two different resonances. For the EP2B,
which is the case studied in the microwave billiard experiment, we verify the
survival probability exhibits the previously reported modified exponential
decay on intermediate timescales, but this is replaced with an inverse power
law on very long timescales. Meanwhile, for the EP2A the influence from the
continuum threshold is so strong that the evolution is non-exponential on all
timescales and the heuristic approach fails completely. When the EP2A appears
very near the threshold we obtain the novel evolution $P(t) \sim 1 - C_1
\sqrt{t} + D_1 t$ on intermediate timescales, while further away the parabolic
decay (Zeno dynamics) on short timescales is enhanced. We also discuss the

cognitive situation as a whole and that the fallacy results from the 'emergence
of new meanings', as an 'effect of overextension' in the conceptual
conjunction. Thus, the question arises as to determine whether and to what
extent conjunction fallacies would result from 'order effects' or, instead,
from 'emergence effects'. To help clarify this situation, we propose to use the
World Wide Web as an 'information space' that can be interrogated both in a
sequential and non-sequential way, to test these two quantum approaches. We
find that 'emergence effects', and not 'order effects', should be considered
the main cognitive mechanism producing the observed conjunction fallacies.

sensor data (input) to motor control values (output), is shaped by stochastic
optimization methods to complete a predefined task. This approach is assumed to
be beneficial compared to standard methods of controller design in those cases
where no a-priori model is available that could help to optimize performance.
Also for robots that have to operate in unpredictable environments, an
evolutionary robotics approach is favorable. We demonstrate here that such a
model-free approach is not a free lunch, as already simple tasks can represent
unsolvable barriers for fully open-ended uninformed evolutionary computation
techniques. We propose here the 'Wankelmut' task as an objective for an
evolutionary approach that starts from scratch without pre-shaped controller
software or any other informed approach that would force the behavior to be
evolved in a desired way. Our focal claim is that 'Wankelmut' represents the
simplest set of problems that makes plain-vanilla evolutionary computation
fail. We demonstrate this by a series of simple standard evolutionary
approaches using different fitness functions and standard artificial neural
networks as well as continuous-time recurrent neural networks. All our tested
approaches failed. We claim that any other evolutionary approach will also fail
that does per-se not favor or enforce modularity and does not freeze or protect
already evolved functionalities. Thus we propose a hard-to-pass benchmark and
make a strong statement for self-complexifying and generative approaches in
evolutionary computation. We anticipate that defining such a 'simplest task to
fail' is a valuable benchmark for promoting future development in the field of
artificial intelligence, evolutionary robotics and artificial life.

be tokenized first, conventional NMT is confronted with two issues: 1) it is
difficult to find an optimal tokenization granularity for source sentence
modelling, and 2) errors in 1-best tokenizations may propagate to the encoder
of NMT. To handle these issues, we propose word-lattice based Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) encoders for NMT, which generalize the standard RNN to word
lattice topology. The proposed encoders take as input a word lattice that
compactly encodes multiple tokenizations, and learn to generate new hidden
states from arbitrarily many inputs and hidden states in preceding time steps.
As such, the word-lattice based encoders not only alleviate the negative impact
of tokenization errors but also are more expressive and flexible to embed input
sentences. Experiment results on Chinese-English translation demonstrate the

star association, with diameter of $\approx 300\,\mathrm{pc}$. We present a
Bayesian scheme to determine the properties of the surrounding massive star

population, as observed in either the WFC3 and WFPC2 observations, can be well
fit by two age distributions with mean ages: ~6.3 Myr and ~50 Myr. The stellar
population is clearly dominated by the younger age solution (by factors of 3.5

to the lifetime of a star with $M_{ZAMS} \sim 30M_{\odot}$. This is strong

Rotation could be an important aspect of any model for SN~Ia, whether single or
double degenerate, with the white dwarf mass at, below, or above the
Chandrasekhar limit. {\sl Differential rotation} is specifically invoked in
attempts to account for the apparent excess mass in the super--Chandrasekhar
events. Some earlier work has suggested that only uniform rotation is
consistent with the expected mechanisms of angular momentum transport in white
dwarfs, while others have found pronounced differential rotation. We show that
if the baroclinic instability is active in degenerate matter and the effects of
magnetic fields are neglected, both nearly-uniform and strongly-differential
rotation are possible. We classify rotation regimes in terms of the Richardson
number, Ri. At small values of Ri $\leq$ 0.1, we find both the low-viscosity
Zahn regime with a non-monotonic angular velocity profile and a new
differential rotation regime for which the viscosity is high and scales
linearly with the shear, $\sigma$. Employment of Kelvin-Helmholtz viscosity
alone yields differential rotation. Large values of Ri $\gg$ 1 produce a regime
of nearly-uniform rotation for which the baroclinic viscosity is of
intermediate value and scales as $\sigma^3$. We discuss the gap in
understanding of the behavior at intermediate values of Ri and how observations
may constrain the rotation regimes attained by nature.

Rosetta spacecraft had the unique opportunity to follow closely a comet in the
most active part of its orbit. Many studies have presented the typical features
associated to the activity of the nucleus, such as localized dust and gas jets.
Here we report on series of more energetic transient events observed during the
three months surrounding the comet's perihelion passage in August 2015.
  We detected and characterized 34 outbursts with the Rosetta cameras, one
every 2.4 nucleus rotation. We identified 3 main dust plume morphologies
associated to these events: a narrow jet, a broad fan, and more complex plumes
featuring both previous types together. These plumes are comparable in scale
and temporal variation to what has been observed on other comets.
  We present a map of the outbursts source locations, and discuss the
associated topography. We find that the spatial distribution sources on the
nucleus correlates well with morphological region boundaries, especially in
areas marked by steep scarps or cliffs.
  Outbursts occur either in the early morning or shortly after the local noon,
indicating two potential processes: Morning outbursts may be triggered by
thermal stresses linked to the rapid change of temperature, afternoon events
are most likely related to the diurnal or seasonal heat wave reaching volatiles
buried under the first surface layer. In addition, we propose that some events
can be the result of a completely different mechanism, in which most of the
dust is released upon the collapse of a cliff.

We propose a high-accuracy approximation approach for the hyperbolic tangent

Cosine Transform Interpolation Filter (DCTIF). The proposed architecture
combines simple arithmetic operations on stored samples of the hyperbolic
tangent function and on input data. The proposed DCTIF implementation achieves
two orders of magnitude greater precision than previous work while using the
same or fewer computational resources. Various combinations of DCTIF parameters
can be chosen to tradeoff the accuracy and complexity of the hyperbolic tangent

tangent activation function with 10E-5 maximum error while requiring only 1.52
Kbits memory and 57 LUTs of a Virtex-7 FPGA. We also discuss how the activation
function accuracy affects the performance of DNNs in terms of their training

necessary in order to maintain the same DNN training and testing performances

charge by exchange of ions. The surface charge is compensated by a strip of
excess charge at the border of the electrolyte forming an electric double
layer. These electric double layers are very hard to model using the supercells
methods of computational condensed phase science. The problem arises when the
solid is an electric insulator (as most ionic solids are) permitting a finite
interior electric field over the width of the slab representing the solid in
the supercell. The slab acts as a capacitor. The stored charge is a deficit in
the solution failing to compensate fully for the solid surface charge. Here we
show how these problems can be overcome using the finite field methods
developed by Stengel, Spaldin and Vanderbilt [Nat. Phys. {\bf 5}, 304, (2009)].
We also show how the capacitance of the double layer can be computed once
overall electric neutrality of the double layer is restored by application of a
finite macroscopic field $\mathbf{E}$ or alternatively by zero electric
displacement $\mathbf{D}$. The method is validated for a classical model of a
solid-electrolyte interface using the finite temperature molecular dynamics
adaptation of the constant field method presented previously [Phys. Rev. B,

probes is, in practice, frequently questioned because of the many uncertainties
impinging on cluster mass estimates. Our aim is to develop a fully
self-consistent cosmological approach of X-ray cluster surveys, exclusively
based on observable quantities, rather than masses. This procedure is justified
given the possibility to directly derive the cluster properties via ab initio
modelling, either analytically or by using hydrodynamical simulations. In this
third paper, we evaluate the method on cluster toy-catalogues. We model the
population of detected clusters in the count-rate -- hardness-ratio -- angular
size -- redshift space and compare the corresponding 4-dimensional diagram with
theoretical predictions. The best cosmology+physics parameter configuration is
determined using a simple minimisation procedure; errors on the parameters are
derived by scanning the likelihood hyper-surfaces with a wide range of starting
values. The method allows a simultaneous fit of the cosmological parameters, of
the cluster evolutionary physics and of the selection effects. When using
information from the X-ray survey alone plus redshifts, this approach is shown
to be as accurate as the mass function for the cosmological parameters and to
perform better for the cluster physics, as modelled in the scaling relations.
It enables the identification of degenerate combinations of parameter values.
Given the considerably shorter computer times involved for running the
minimisation procedure in the observed parameter space, this method appears to

  Number-Theoretic Consistent-Histories Approach to Local Quantum Realism","40 pages, 6 Figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although the notion of superdeterminism can, in principle, account for the
violation of the Bell inequalities, this potential explanation has been roundly
rejected by the quantum foundations community. The arguments for rejection, one
of the most substantive coming from Bell himself, are critically reviewed. In
particular, analysis of Bell's argument reveals an implicit unwarranted
assumption: that the Euclidean metric is the appropriate yardstick for
measuring distances in state space. Bell's argument is largely negated if this
yardstick is instead based on the alternative $p$-adic metric. Such a metric,
common in number theory, arises naturally when describing chaotic systems which
evolve precisely on self-similar invariant sets in their state space. A
locally-causal realistic model of quantum entanglement is developed, based on
the premise that the laws of physics ultimately derive from an invariant-set
geometry in the state space of a deterministic quasi-cyclic mono-universe.
Based on this, the notion of a complex Hilbert vector is reinterpreted in terms
of an uncertain selection from a finite sample space of states, leading to a
novel form of `consistent histories' based on number-theoretic properties of
the transcendental cosine function. This leads to novel realistic
interpretations of position/momentum non-commutativity, EPR, the Bell Theorem
and the Tsirelson bound. In this inherently holistic theory - neither
conspiratorial, retrocausal, fine tuned nor nonlocal - superdeterminism is not
invoked by fiat but is emergent from these `consistent histories'
number-theoretic constraints. Invariant set theory provides new perspectives on
many of the contemporary problems at the interface of quantum and gravitational
physics, and, if correct, may signal the end of particle physics beyond the
Standard Model.

electrostatic and magnetostatic fields but they do not usually apply this
theorem to derive expressions for the time-dependent electric and magnetic
fields, even when there is no formal objection to doing so because the proof of
the theorem does not involve time derivatives but only spatial derivatives.
Here we address the question as to whether the Helmholtz theorem is useful to
derive expressions for the fields of Maxwell's equations. We show that when
this theorem is applied to Maxwell's equations we obtain instantaneous
expressions of the electric and magnetic fields, which are formally correct but
of little practical usefulness. We then discuss two generalizations of the
theorem which are shown to be useful to derive the retarded fields.

n-p-n bipolar transistor action in the source side of a junctionless nanowire
tunneling FET (BJN-TFET). In the on-state, tunneling of electrons from valence
band of the source to conduction band of the channel enhances the hole
concentration as well as the potential in the source region which drives a
built-in BJT transistor by forward biasing the base-emitter junction, with the
source acting as a p-type region. Owing to the sharp switching of the JN-TFET
and high BJT current gain, the overall performance is improved, including
favorable high on-state current (2.17*10-6 A/um), and sub 60 mV/dec
subthreshold swing (~ 50 mV/dec) at low supply voltages. This approach modifies
the current mechanism owning to the triggered BJT and makes the proposed
structure more attractive for scaling requirements in future low power
application.

combining the spiking Random Neural Network (RNN) model, the network
architecture typical used in deep-learning area and the training technique
inspired from nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). The shallow autoencoder
is a simplified RNN model, which is then stacked into a multi-layer
architecture. The learning algorithm is based on the weight update rules in
NMF, subject to the nonnegative probability constraints of the RNN. The
autoencoders equipped with this learning algorithm are tested on typical image
datasets including the MNIST, Yale face and CIFAR-10 datasets, and also using
16 real-world datasets from different areas. The results obtained through these
tests yield the desired high learning and recognition accuracy. Also, numerical
simulations of the stochastic spiking behavior of this RNN auto encoder, show
that it can be implemented in a highly-distributed manner.

in the open field. Acoustic detection of avian sounds can be used for the
automatized monitoring of multiple bird taxa and querying in long-term
recordings for species of interest for researchers, conservation practitioners,
and decision makers. Recordings in the wild can be very noisy due to the
exposure of the microphones to a large number of audio sources originating from
all distances and directions, the number and identity of which cannot be known
a-priori. The co-existence of the target vocalizations with abiotic
interferences in an unconstrained environment is inefficiently treated by
current approaches of audio signal enhancement. A technique that would spot
only bird vocalization while ignoring other audio sources is of prime
importance. These difficulties are tackled in this work, presenting a deep
autoencoder that maps the audio spectrogram of bird vocalizations to its
corresponding binary mask that encircles the spectral blobs of vocalizations
while suppressing other audio sources. The procedure requires minimum human
attendance, it is very fast during execution, thus suitable to scan massive
volumes of data, in order to analyze them, evaluate insights and hypotheses,
identify patterns of bird activity that, hopefully, finally lead to design
policies on biodiversity issues.

appears to perceive an improbably instantaneous and non-continuous change in
age of the stationary twin. In this work, a smooth velocity/acceleration
profile is used that allows the abrupt velocity-change case as a limit. All
gravitational effects are ignored in this treatment. Aside from mutual
perception of simultaneous clock times in an accelerating frame, constant
communication of clock times between the twins by means of (digital) light
signals is shown to be possible, in principle if not in practice.
