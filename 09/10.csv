  Descent",,,,,"math.OC cs.DC cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work addresses decentralized online optimization in non-stationary
environments. A network of agents aim to track the minimizer of a global
time-varying convex function. The minimizer evolves according to a known
dynamics corrupted by an unknown, unstructured noise. At each time, the global
function can be cast as a sum of a finite number of local functions, each of
which is assigned to one agent in the network. Moreover, the local functions
become available to agents sequentially, and agents do not have a prior
knowledge of the future cost functions. Therefore, agents must communicate with
each other to build an online approximation of the global function. We propose
a decentralized variation of the celebrated Mirror Descent, developed by
Nemirovksi and Yudin. Using the notion of Bregman divergence in lieu of
Euclidean distance for projection, Mirror Descent has been shown to be a
powerful tool in large-scale optimization. Our algorithm builds on Mirror
Descent, while ensuring that agents perform a consensus step to follow the
global function and take into account the dynamics of the global minimizer. To
measure the performance of the proposed online algorithm, we compare it to its
offline counterpart, where the global functions are available a priori. The gap
between the two is called dynamic regret. We establish a regret bound that
scales inversely in the spectral gap of the network, and more notably it
represents the deviation of minimizer sequence with respect to the given
dynamics. We then show that our results subsume a number of results in
distributed optimization. We demonstrate the application of our method to
decentralized tracking of dynamic parameters and verify the results via
numerical experiments.

speech. As such, they have many benefits. By using speech as the primary
communication medium, a computer interface can facilitate swift, human-like
acquisition of information. In recent years, speech interfaces have become ever
more popular, as is evident from the rise of personal assistants such as Siri,
Google Now, Cortana and Amazon Alexa. Recently, data-driven machine learning
methods have been applied to dialogue modelling and the results achieved for
limited-domain applications are comparable to or outperform traditional
approaches. Methods based on Gaussian processes are particularly effective as
they enable good models to be estimated from limited training data.
Furthermore, they provide an explicit estimate of the uncertainty which is
particularly useful for reinforcement learning. This article explores the
additional steps that are necessary to extend these methods to model multiple
dialogue domains. We show that Gaussian process reinforcement learning is an
elegant framework that naturally supports a range of methods, including prior
knowledge, Bayesian committee machines and multi-agent learning, for
facilitating extensible and adaptable dialogue systems.

The reviewed methods include the generating function technique and the Poisson
representation, as well as novel ways of mapping the forward and backward
master equations onto linear partial differential equations (PDEs). Spectral
methods, WKB approximations, and a variational approach have been proposed for
the analysis of the PDE obeyed by the generating function. After outlining
these methods, we solve the derived PDEs in terms of two path integrals. The
path integrals provide distinct exact representations of the conditional
probability distribution solving the master equations. We exemplify both path
integrals in analysing elementary chemical reactions. Furthermore, we review a
method for the approximation of rare event probabilities and derive path
integral representations of Fokker-Planck equations. To make our review
accessible to a broad community, we have used the language of probability
theory rather than quantum (field) theory. The probabilistic structures
underpinning various technical concepts, such as coherent states, the
Doi-shift, and normal-ordered observables, are thereby made explicit.

this idea by taking into account corrections to the Wald entropy. Using the

calculate corrections to the Wald entropy and find that these corrections are

the full channel thickness with aspect--ratio considerably higher than unity;
it has been observed that they have an important redistributing effect on
temperature and momentum. The mean values and the variances of the flow
variables do not appear to follow Prandtl's scaling in the flow regime near
free convection, except for the temperature and vertical velocity fluctuations,
which are more affected by turbulent plumes. Nevertheless, we find that the
Monin--Obukhov theory still yields a useful representation of the main flow
features. In particular, the widely used Businger--Dyer relationships provide a
convenient way of accounting for the bulk effects of shear and buoyancy,
although individual profiles may vary widely from the alleged trends.
Significant deviations are found in DNS with respect to the commonly used
parametrization of the mean velocity in the light-wind regime, which may have
important practical impact in models of atmospheric dynamics. Finally, for
modelling purposes, we devise a set of empirical predictive formulas for the
heat flux and friction coefficients which can be used with about $10\%$ maximum

temperatures with keeping the renormalization function and a full momentum
dependence of the pairing gap. When superconductivity occurs in the tetragonal

the Fermi surfaces. The superconducting instability occurs also inside the
nematic phase. When the $d_{xz}$ orbital is occupied more than the $d_{yz}$

is weak on the electron Fermi surfaces. We also find that while the leading

degenerate in the tetragonal phase whereas such quasi-degeneracy is lifted in

five hybrid $\delta$ Scuti-$\gamma$ Doradus stars. We employ a grid-based
modeling approach to sound the internal structure of the target stars by
employing a huge grid of stellar models from the zero-age main sequence to the
terminal-age main sequence, varying parameters like stellar mass, effective
temperature, metallicity and core overshooting. We compute their adiabatic
radial ($\ell= 0$) and non-radial ($\ell= 1, 2, 3$) $p$ and $g$ mode periods.
We employ two model-fitting procedures to searching for the models that best
reproduce the observed pulsation spectra of each target star, that is, the
asteroseismological models. We derive the fundamental parameters and the
evolutionary status of five hybrid $\delta$ Scuti-$\gamma$ Doradus variable

asteroseismological model for each star results from different criteria of
model selection, in which we take full advantage of the richness of periods

pulse can experience a $\pi$ phase shift due to the presence or absence of a

the quantum memory process, we demonstrated a controlled phase gate between two
single photons. To this end, firstly one needs to store a (control) photon in
the ground atomic states. In the following, a second (target) photon must
impinge on the atom-cavity system. Depending on the atomic state, this second
photon will be either transmitted or reflected, acquiring different phase
shifts. This protocol can then be easily extended to multiphoton systems, i.e.,
keeping the control photon stored, it may induce phase shifts in several single
photons, thus enabling the generation of multipartite entangled states. We
explore the relevant parameter space in the atom-cavity system that allows the
implementation of quantum phase gates using the recent technologies. In
particular we have found a lower bound for the cooperativity of the atom-cavity
system which enables the implementation of phase shift on single photons. The
induced shift on the phase of a photonic qubit and the controlled phase gate
between single photons, combined with optical devices, enable to perform
universal quantum computation.

properties of the liquid phase are in nearly quantitative agreement with X-ray

that the dynamics of the flow was dominated by coherent structures made of a
superposition of nonlinear waves. (Mixed)-ribbons and (mixed)-cross-spirals are
generated by interactions between a pair of linearly unstable helical modes of
opposite `handedness', and appear to be responsible for the formation of
well-mixed layers and sharp density interfaces. In this paper, we show that
these structures are also fully accountable for the upwards buoyancy flux in
the simulations. The mechanism by which this occurs is a positive coupling
between the density and vertical velocity components of the most energetic
waves. This coupling is primarily caused by diffusion of density at low Schmidt
number Sc, but can also be a nonlinear effect at larger Sc. Turbulence was
found to contribute negatively to the buoyancy flux at Sc=1,10,16, which lead
to the conclusion that mass upwelling is a consequence of chaotic advection,
even at large Reynolds number. Artificially isolating the coherent structure
therefore leads to excellent estimates of the flux Richardson numbers Ri_f from
the DNS. We also used the theoretical framework of Winters et al. (1995) to
analyse the energetics of mixing in an open control volume, shedding light on
the influence of end effects in the potential energy budget. The potential
connection with the buoyancy flux measurements made in the recent experiment of
Oglethorpe et al. (2013) is also discussed.

an outstanding question in the field. We model a sample of 32 axisymmetric SNRs
using the quasi-perpendicular and quasi-parallel cosmic-ray-electron (CRE)
acceleration cases. The axisymmetric sample is defined to include SNRs with a
double-sided, bilateral morphology, and also those with a one-sided morphology
where one limb is much brighter than the other. Using a coordinate
transformation technique, we insert a bubble-like model SNR into a model of the
Galactic magnetic field. Since radio emission of SNRs is dominated by
synchrotron emission and since this emission depends on the magnetic field and
CRE distribution, we are able to simulate the SNRs emission and compare this to
data. We find that the quasi-perpendicular CRE acceleration case is much more
consistent with the data than the quasi-parallel CRE acceleration case, with
G327.6+14.6 (SN1006) being a notable exception. We propose that SN1006 may be a
case where both quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular acceleration are
simultaneously at play in a single SNR.

""lift"" this oracle separation to the setting of communication complexity,
thereby answering a question of G\""o\""os et al. (ICALP 2016). Third, we give
relativized evidence that perfect zero knowledge proofs (captured by the class

oracles relative to which SZK is not contained in PZK, NISZK is not contained
in NIPZK, and PZK is not equal to coPZK. The first of these results answers a

additional applications of these results outside of structural complexity.
  The technical core of our results is a stronger hardness amplification
theorem for approximate degree, which roughly says that composing the
gapped-majority function with any function of high approximate degree yields a
function with high threshold degree.

These spacetimes are considered as simple models for a multidimensional global
monopole (if \mbox{$n\geqslant 3$}) or cosmic string (if $n=2$) with $(d-n-1)$
flat extra dimensions. Thus, we refer to them as conical backgrounds. In terms
of the angular deficit value, we derive the perturbative expression for the
scalar Green's function, valid for any $d\geqslant 3$ and $2\leqslant
n\leqslant d-1$, and compute it to the leading order. With the use of this
Green's function we compute the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the
field square $\langle \phi^{2}(x)\rangle_{\mathrm{ren}}$ and the renormalized
vacuum averaged of the scalar-field's energy-momentum tensor $\langle T_{M

Variational integrators reformulate the equations of motion for multibody
systems as discrete Euler-Lagrange (DEL) equations, transforming forward
integration into a root-finding problem for the DEL equations. Variational
integrators have been shown to be more robust and accurate in preserving
fundamental properties of systems, such as momentum and energy, than many
frequently used numerical integrators. However, state-of-the-art algorithms
suffer from $O(n^3)$ complexity, which is prohibitive for articulated multibody
systems with a large number of degrees of freedom, $n$, in generalized
coordinates. Our key contribution is to derive a recursive algorithm that
evaluates DEL equations in $O(n)$, which scales up well for complex multibody
systems such as humanoid robots. Inspired by recursive Newton-Euler algorithm,
our key insight is to formulate DEL equation individually for each body rather
than for the entire system. Furthermore, we introduce a new quasi-Newton method
that exploits the impulse-based dynamics algorithm, which is also $O(n)$, to
avoid the expensive Jacobian inversion in solving DEL equations. We demonstrate
scalability and efficiency, as well as extensibility to holonomic constraints
through several case studies.

solves the localization problem and works down to the theoretical detectability

blind spectroscopy from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, MUSE, in the
Hubble Deep Field South. Using automatic source-detection software, we assemble
a homogeneously-detected sample of 59 Ly{\alpha} emitters covering a flux range
of -18.0 < log10 (F) < -16.3 (erg s^-1 cm^-2), corresponding to luminosities of
41.4 < log10 (L) < 42.8 (erg s^-1). As recent studies have shown, Ly{\alpha}
fluxes can be underestimated by a factor of two or more via traditional
methods, and so we undertake a careful assessment of each object's Ly{\alpha}
flux using a curve-of-growth analysis to account for extended emission. We
describe our self-consistent method for determining the completeness of the
sample, and present an estimate of the global Ly{\alpha} luminosity function
between redshifts 2.91 < z < 6.64 using the 1/Vmax estimator. We find the
luminosity function is higher than many number densities reported in the
literature by a factor of 2 - 3, although our result is consistent at the
1{\sigma} level with most of these studies. Our observed luminosity function is
also in good agreement with predictions from semi-analytic models, and shows no
evidence for strong evolution between the high- and low-redshift halves of the
data. We demonstrate that one's approach to Ly{\alpha} flux estimation does
alter the observed luminosity function, and caution that accurate flux
assessments will be crucial in measurements of the faint end slope. This is a
pilot study for the Ly{\alpha} luminosity function in the MUSE deep-fields, to
be built on with data from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field which will increase the
size of our sample by almost a factor of 10.

stellar systems. Here, we reanalyze the 10-year SN sample collected during
1998-2008 by the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) in order to constrain
the progenitors of SNe Ia and stripped-envelope SNe (SE SNe, i.e., SNe~IIb, Ib,
Ic, and broad-lined Ic). We matched the LOSS galaxy sample with spectroscopy
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and measured SN rates as a function of galaxy
stellar mass, specific star formation rate, and oxygen abundance (metallicity).
We find significant correlations between the SN rates and all three galaxy
properties. The SN Ia correlations are consistent with other measurements, as
well as with our previous explanation of these measurements in the form of a
combination of the SN Ia delay-time distribution and the correlation between
galaxy mass and age. The ratio between the SE SN and SN II rates declines
significantly in low-mass galaxies. This rules out single stars as SE~SN
progenitors, and is consistent with predictions from binary-system progenitor
models. Using well-known galaxy scaling relations, any correlation between the
rates and one of the galaxy properties examined here can be expressed as a
correlation with the other two. These redundant correlations preclude us from
establishing causality - that is, from ascertaining which of the galaxy
properties (or their combination) is the physical driver for the difference
between the SE SN and SN II rates. We outline several methods that have the
potential to overcome this problem in future works.

a small subset of the data now available, however, and recent studies have both
updated some subtype distinctions and improved our ability to perform robust

spectroscopic classifications of all events in the LOSS volume-limited sample

the often unclear boundary between SNe Ib and Ic when only noisy spectra are

this result by splitting the volume-limited subsample of the Lick Observatory

SNe Ib and Ic are underrepresented by a factor of ~3 in low-mass galaxies.
These galaxies also contain the only examples of SN 1987A-like SNe in the

scalar field, and, (ii) we put the simulation results into the greater context
of a general screened-modified gravity parametrization. We have compared the
mass of clusters inferred via lensing versus the mass inferred via kinematical
measurements as a probe of violations of the equivalence principle at Mpc
scales. We find that estimates of cluster masses via X-ray observations is
mainly sensitive to the coupling between the scalar degree of freedom and
baryons - while the kinematical mass is mainly sensitive to the coupling to
dark matter. Therefore, the relation between the two mass estimates is a probe
of a possible non-universal coupling between the scalar field, the standard
model fields, and dark matter. Finally, we used observational data of kinetic,
thermal and lensing masses to place constraints on deviations from general
relativity on cluster scales for a general parametrization of screened modified
gravity theories which contains $f(R)$ and Symmetron models. We find that while
the kinematic mass can be used to place competitive constraints, using thermal
measurements is challenging as a potential non-thermal contribution is
degenerate with the imprint of modified gravity.

sensitive training data, commercial value, or use in security applications.
Increasingly often, confidential ML models are being deployed with publicly
accessible query interfaces. ML-as-a-service (""predictive analytics"") systems
are an example: Some allow users to train models on potentially sensitive data
and charge others for access on a pay-per-query basis.
  The tension between model confidentiality and public access motivates our
investigation of model extraction attacks. In such attacks, an adversary with
black-box access, but no prior knowledge of an ML model's parameters or
training data, aims to duplicate the functionality of (i.e., ""steal"") the
model. Unlike in classical learning theory settings, ML-as-a-service offerings
may accept partial feature vectors as inputs and include confidence values with
predictions. Given these practices, we show simple, efficient attacks that
extract target ML models with near-perfect fidelity for popular model classes
including logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees. We
demonstrate these attacks against the online services of BigML and Amazon
Machine Learning. We further show that the natural countermeasure of omitting
confidence values from model outputs still admits potentially harmful model
extraction attacks. Our results highlight the need for careful ML model
deployment and new model extraction countermeasures.

market in the near future. This requires transportation facilities ready to
operate in a mixed traffic environment where a portion of vehicles are CAVs and
the remaining are manual vehicles. Since CAVs are able to run with less spacing
and headway compared with manual vehicles or mixed traffic, allocating a number
of freeway lanes exclusive to CAVs may improve the overall performance of
freeways. In this paper, we propose an analytical managed lane model to
evaluate the freeway flow in mixed traffic and to determine the optimal number
of lanes to be allocated to CAVs. The proposed model is investigated in two
different operation environments: single-lane and managed lane environments. We
further define three different CAV technology scenarios: neutral, conservative,
and aggressive. In the single-lane problem, the influence of CAV penetration
rates on mixed traffic capacity is examined in each scenario. In the managed
lanes problem, we propose a method to determine the optimal number of dedicated
lanes for CAVs under different settings. A number of numerical examples with
different geometries and demand levels are investigated for all three
scenarios. A sensitivity analysis on the penetration rates is conducted. The
results show that more aggressive CAV technologies need less specific allocated
lanes because they can follow the vehicles with less time and space headways.

detect new malware, they are not always efficient with new obfuscation
techniques. Besides, new malware is easily created and old malware can be
recoded to produce new one. Therefore, classical Antivirus becomes consistently
less effective in dealing with those new threats. Also malware gets hand
tailored to bypass network security and Antivirus. But as analysts do not have
enough time to dissect suspected malware by hand, automated approaches have
been developed. To cope with the mass of new malware, statistical and machine
learning methods proved to be a good approach classifying programs, especially
when using multiple approaches together to provide a likelihood of software
being malicious. In normal approach, some steps have been taken, mostly by
analyzing the opcodes or mnemonics of disassembly and their distribution. In
this paper, we focus on the control flow change (CFC) itself and finding out if
it is significant to detect malware. In the scope of this work, only relative
control flow changes are contemplated, as these are easier to extract from the
first chosen disassembler library and are within a range of 256 addresses.
These features are analyzed as a raw feature, as n-grams of length 2, 4 and 6

Statistical methods were used as well as the Naive-Bayes algorithm to find out
if there is significant data in CFC. We also test our approach with real-world

that it is a gamma-ray redback millisecond pulsar binary with a low-mass

continuous curves whose finite dimensional distributions are given by the
multi-line Airy process. It is a natural object in the KPZ universality class:
for example, its highest curve, the Airy$_2$ process, describes after the
subtraction of a parabola the limiting law of the scaled energy of a geodesic
running from the origin to a variable point on an anti-diagonal line in such
problems as Poissonian last passage percolation. The ensemble of curves
resulting from the Airy line ensemble after the subtraction of the same
parabola enjoys a simple and explicit spatial Markov property, the Brownian
Gibbs property. In this paper, we employ the Brownian Gibbs property to make a
close comparison between the Airy line ensemble's curves after affine shift and
Brownian bridge, proving the finiteness of a superpolynomially growing moment
bound on Radon-Nikodym derivatives. We also determine the value of a natural

useful elsewhere for finding upper bounds on probabilities of events concerning
random systems of curves enjoying the Brownian Gibbs property. Several results
in this article play a fundamental role in a further study of Brownian last

levels at distances as low as 2 au from the central star. With a total of 31

  without consents of all authors",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Joint models for longitudinal biomarkers and time-to-event data are widely
used in longitudinal studies. Many joint modeling approaches have been proposed
to deal with different types of longitudinal biomarkers and survival outcomes.
However, most existing joint modeling methods cannot deal with a large number
of longitudinal biomarkers simultaneously, such as the longitudinally collected
gene expression profiles. In this article, we propose a new joint modeling
method under the Bayesian framework, which is able to deal with longitudinal
biomarkers of high dimension. Specifically, we assume that only a few
unobserved latent variables are related to the survival outcome and the latent
variables are inferred using a factor analysis model, which greatly reduces the
dimensionality of the biomarkers and also accounts for the high correlations
among the biomarkers. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that our
proposed method has improved prediction accuracy over other joint modeling
methods. We illustrate the usefulness of our method on a dataset of idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis patients in which we are interested in predicting the
patients' time-to-death using their gene expression profiles.

leaks no information about the graph structure of the social network. Several
cryptographic techniques are applied to improve the existing DP5 protocol---the
first privacy-preserving presence protocol---while maintaining the same level
of privacy. The key contribution of this paper is the use of a dynamic
broadcast encryption scheme to reduce the size of the presence database. This
enables cheaper registration and lookup required for the protocol. As compared
to DP5, MP3 requires on the order of ten times less bandwidth of the servers
during registration, and requires on the order of two times less bandwidth for
lookup, for a small number of users ($N=10000$). Furthermore, these savings
asymptotically increase with the number of users. The client-side latency is
also improved significantly in MP3, as compared with DP5. We provide an
evaluation of the performance and scalability of both protocols.

pure gravity and thermal pressure. An analytic model for the formation of
magnetic ribbons that is based on numerical simulations is used to derive a
lateral width of a magnetic ribbon. This differs from the thickness along the

Furthermore, under this theoretical framework, the controversy of opposite TER
signs observed experimentally by different groups in

considering the interface termination effects using the effective contact
ratio, defined through the effective screening length and dielectric response
at the metal/ferroelectric interfaces. Finally, our approach is extended to
investigate the role of a CoO$_{x}$ buffer layer at the Co/BaTiO$_{3}$

significant memristor behavior, not only the interface oxygen vacancies but
also the CoO$_{x}$ layer thickness may vary with the applied bias.

same principle can only achieve 1) low resolution volume colorization or 2)
high resolution images but only on a limited number of flat planes. In this

ferromagnetic ordering, which can be utilized in future to spintronics and
superconducting spintronics devices. Recently, we observed strongly enhanced
magnetization of SRO113 thin films grown on single crystals of the spin-triplet
superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ (SRO214). To clarify the origin of such an
enhancement, we conducted systematic investigations of magnetic properties of
SRO113 films deposited on a variety of oxide substrates. We carefully
subtracted the substrate contributions and found that the enhanced 2
magnetization occurs only for SRO113/SRO214 films. We further found that
neither strain nor metallicity of the substrate plays any significant roles in
the enhancement. The X-ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals that the
substrate-induced strain does not switch the Ru4+ state from the low-spin to
high-spin states. The film-thickness dependence of the magnetization of
SRO113/SRO214 films strongly suggest that the additional magnetization arises
due to the induction of magnetic moment into the SRO214 substrate over 20-nm
depth. Our results imply new magnetic functionality that can trigger studies
searching for yet unknown physical phenomena in magnetic ruthenates.

control, which employs a certainty equivalence (indirect) control law and an
identifier with event-triggered updates of the plant parameter estimates, where
the triggers are based on the size of the plant's state and the updates are
conducted using a non-recursive least-squares estimation over certain finite
time intervals, with updates employing delayed measurements of the state. With
a suitable non-restrictive parameter-observability assumption, our adaptive
controller guarantees global stability, regulation of the plant state, and our
identifier achieves parameter convergence, in finite time, even in the absence
of persistent excitation, for all initial conditions other than those where the
initial plant state is zero. The robustness of our event-triggered adaptive
control scheme to vanishing and non-vanishing disturbances is verified in
simulations with the assistance of a dead zone-like modification of the update
law. The major distinctions of our approach from supervisory adaptive schemes
is that our approach is indirect and our triggering is related to the control
objective (the regulation error). The major distinction from the classical
indirect Lyapunov adaptive schemes based on tuning related to the regulation
error is that our approach does not involve a complex redesign of the
controller to compensate for the detrimental effects of rapid tuning on the
transients by incorporating the update law into the control law. Instead, our
approach allows for the first time to use a simple certainty equivalence
adaptive controller for general nonlinear systems. All proofs are given in a

Envelope enrichment by planetesimal impacts during formation dominates the
final planetary atmospheric composition of hot Jupiters. We investigate two,
under this finding, prototypical formation pathways: a formation inside or
outside the water iceline, called ""dry"" and ""wet"" planets, respectively. (2)
Both the ""dry"" and ""wet"" planets are oxygen-rich (C/O<1) due to the oxygen-rich
nature of the solid building blocks. The ""dry"" planet's C/O ratio is <0.2 for
standard carbon depletion, while the ""wet"" planet has typical C/O values
between 0.1 and 0.5 depending mainly on the clathrate formation efficiency.
Only non-standard disk chemistries without carbon depletion lead to carbon-rich
C/O ratios >1 for the ""dry"" planet. (3) While we consistently find C/O ratios
<1, they still vary significantly. To link a formation history to a specific
C/O, a better understanding of the disk chemistry is thus needed.

surfaces that are gently slopped with respect to the build direction. Reducing
the slice thickness improves the situation but never resolves it completely as
flat layers remain a poor approximation of the true surface in these regions.
In addition, reducing the slice thickness largely increases the print time. In
this work we focus on a simple yet effective technique to improve the print
accuracy for layered manufacturing by filament deposition. Our method works
with standard three-axis 3D filament printers (e.g. the typical, widely
available 3D printers), using standard extrusion nozzles. It better reproduces
the geometry of sloped surfaces without increasing the print time. Our key idea
is to perform a local anti-aliasing, working at a sub-layer accuracy to produce
slightly curved deposition paths and reduce approximation errors. This is
inspired by Computer Graphics anti-aliasing techniques which consider sub-pixel
precision to treat aliasing effects. We show that the necessary deviation in
height compared to standard slicing is bounded by half the layer thickness.
Therefore, the height changes remain small and plastic deposition remains
reliable. We further split and order paths to minimize defects due to the
extruder nozzle shape, avoiding any change to the existing hardware. We apply
and analyze our approach on 3D printed examples, showing that our technique
greatly improves surface accuracy and silhouette quality while keeping the
print time nearly identical.

many medical and computer brain interface classifications. A common
characteristic of wireless EEG sensors is that they are low powered devices,
and hence an efficient usage of sensor energy resources is critical for any
practical application. One way of minimizing energy consumption by the EEG
sensors is by reducing the number of EEG channels participating in the
classification process. For the purpose of classifying EEG signals, we propose
a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based channel selection algorithm. To achieve
this objective, the EEG sensor channels are first realized in a complete
undirected graph, where each channel is represented by a node. An edge between
any two nodes indicates the collaboration between these nodes in identifying
the system state; and the significance of this collaboration is quantified by a
weight assigned to the edge. The complete graph is then reduced into a directed
acyclic graph that encodes the knowledge of the non-increasing order of the
channel ranking for each cognitive task. The channel selection algorithm
utilizes this directed graph to find a maximum path such that the total weight
of this path satisfies a predefined threshold. It has been demonstrated
experimentally that channel utilization has been reduced by 50% in the worst
case scenario for a three-state system and an EEG sensor with 14 channels; and
the best classification accuracy obtained is 81%.

is based on the Clausen representation of odd integer zeta values. Although,
relatively fast converging series based on the Clausen representation exist for
$\zeta(3)$, their convergence behavior is very slow compared to BBP-type
formulas, and as a consequence they are not used for explicit numerical
computations. The reason is found in the fact that the corresponding Clausen
function can be calculated analytically for a few rational arguments only,
where $x=\frac{1}{6}$ is the smallest one. Using polylogarithmic identities in
combination with a polynomial description of the even Bernoulli numbers, the
convergence behavior of the Clausen-type representation has been improved to a
level that allows us to challenge ultimately all BBP-type formulas available
for $\zeta(3)$. We present an explicit numerical comparison between one of the
best available BBP formulas and our formalism. Furthermore, we demonstrate by
an explicit computation using the first four terms in our series representation
only that $\zeta(3)$ results with an accuracy of $2*10^{-26}$, where our
computation guarantees on each approximation level for an analytical expression

intrinsically low areal density of bright targets. Unfortunately, no existing
catalog of stellar parameters is both deep and wide enough to provide a
homogeneous input list. As the first Gaia data release exploitable for this
purpose is expected to be released not earlier than late 2017, we have devised
an improved reduced-proper-motion method to discriminate late field dwarfs and
giants by combining UCAC4 proper motions with APASS DR6 photometry, and relying
on RAVE DR4 as an external calibrator. The output, named UCAC4-RPM, is a
publicly-available, complete all-sky catalog of solar-type dwarfs down to
V<13.5, plus an extension to logg>3.0 subgiants. The relatively low amount of
contamination (defined as the fraction of false positives; <30%) also makes
UCAC4-RPM a useful tool for the past and ongoing ground-based transit surveys,

0<z<2.5. The SEDs are modelled with the CIGALE code which relies on the energy
balance between the absorbed stellar and the dust emission while taking into
account the possible contribution due to the presence of an AGN. We split the
galaxies in three groups, a low-redshift, a mid-redshift and a high-redshift
and find that the vast majority of the Spitzer/IRS galaxies are star-forming
and lie on or above the star-forming MS of the corresponding redshift.
Moreover, the emission of Spitzer/IRS galaxies with z<0.1 is mostly dominated
by star-formation, galaxies in the mid-redshift bin are a mixture of star
forming and AGN galaxies, while half of the galaxies with z<0.5 show moderate
or high AGN activity. Additionally, using rest-frame NUV-r colour, S\'ersic
indices, optical OIII and NII emission lines we explore the nature of these
galaxies by investigating their structure as well as their star-formation and
AGN activity. Using a colour magnitude diagram we confirm that 97% of the
galaxies with redshift smaller than 0.5 have experienced a recent
star-formation episode. For a sub-sample of galaxies with available structural
information and redshift smaller than 0.3 we find that early-type galaxies are
placed below the MS, while late-type galaxies are found on the MS as expected.
Finally, for all the galaxies with z<0.5 and available optical spectral line

the liquid freezes in a fully icosahedral structure via a sharp `transition'.
Frustration increases upon reducing the curvature, and the transition to the

comprehension and computational analysis. Principal component analysis is the
most popular approach to rendering two- or three-dimensional representations of
the major trends in such multidimensional data. The problem of
multidimensionality is acute in the rapidly growing area of phylogenomics.
Evolutionary relationships are represented by phylogenetic trees, and very
typically a phylogenomic analysis results in a collection of such trees, one
for each gene in the analysis. Principal component analysis offers a means of
quantifying variation and summarizing a collection of phylogenies by
dimensional reduction. However, the space of all possible phylogenies on a
fixed set of species does not form a Euclidean vector space, so principal
component analysis must be reformulated in the geometry of tree-space, which is
a CAT(0) geodesic metric space. Previous work has focused on construction of
the first principal component, or principal geodesic. Here we propose a
geometric object which represents a $k$-th order principal component: the locus
of the weighted Fr\'echet mean of $k+1$ points in tree-space, where the weights
vary over the standard $k$-dimensional simplex. We establish basic properties
of these objects, in particular that locally they generically have dimension
$k$, and we propose an efficient algorithm for projection onto these surfaces.
Combined with a stochastic optimization algorithm, this projection algorithm
gives a procedure for constructing a principal component of arbitrary order in
tree-space. Simulation studies confirm these algorithms perform well, and they
are applied to data sets of Apicomplexa gene trees and the African coelacanth
genome. The results enable visualizations of slices of tree-space, revealing

the apparent divergence of the compressibility and specific heat on
supercooling water. Such a counter intuitive possibility, e.g. a liquid that
becomes unstable to gas-like fluctuations on cooling at positive pressure, has
never been observed, neither in real substances nor in off-lattice simulations.
More recently, such re-entrant scenario has been dismissed on the premise that
the re-entrant spinodal would collide with the gas-liquid binodal in the
pressure-temperature plane. Here we study, numerically and analytically, two
previously introduced one-component patchy particle models that both show (i) a
re-entrant spinodal and (ii) a re-entrant binodal, providing a neat in silico

velocity gradients and broad shifted profiles, which could be due to the
expansion of bubbles. The masses of molecular clouds within bubbles range from
100 to 19,000 solar mass, and their dynamic ages are about 0.3-3.7 Myr, which
takes into account the internal turbulence pressure of surrounding molecular
clouds. Clumps are found in the vicinity of all 18 bubbles, and molecular
clouds near four of these bubbles with larger angular sizes show shell-like
morphologies, indicating that either collect-and-collapse or radiation-driven
implosion processes may have occurred. Due to the contamination of adjacent
molecular clouds, only six bubble regions are appropriate to search for
outflows, and we find that four of them have outflow activities. Three bubbles
display ultra-compact HII regions at their borders, and one of them is probably

is introduced into a three-stream framework so as to identify actions from a

capture static spatial features, short-term motion and long-term motion in the

implication that the choice of gauge carries physical information is confirmed
by exhibiting a set of potentials that describes fields correctly, but that
violates physical constraints. The basic conclusions are that physical
requirements place limits on acceptable gauges; and that potentials are more
fundamental than fields in both classical and quantum physics, representing a
major generalization of the quantum-only Aharonov-Bohm effect. These important

function collapse. Different MWI trees representing the same quantum events can
have different topologies, depending upon the observer. However, they are all
isomorphic to the group of block universes containing all of the outcomes of
all of the events, and so, in that sense, the group of block universes is a
more fundamental representation. Different branches of the MWI tree,
representing different universes in MWI, ultimately share the same quantum
state in a common ancestor branch. This branching topology is incompatible with
that of the Minkowski block universe; the resolution is to replace the branches
with discrete, parallel block universes, each of which extends from the trunk
to the outermost twigs. The number of universes in a branch is proportional to
its thickness which, in turn, depends upon the absolute square of the
probability amplitude for the state in that branch. Every quantum event may be
represented by a kernel of universes, which is the smallest group of universes
that will reproduce the quantum probabilities of the outcomes of that event. By
considering the ratios of the probabilities of the outcomes of any event, it
can be shown that the number of universes in every kernel must finite, as must
be the total number of universes in the multiverse. Further, every universe in
the multiverse must be finite both in space and time. Another consequence is
that quantum probabilities must be rational, which suggests that quantum

not every conceivable universe exists in the multiverse, no doubt to the

intelligent utilization of domain knowledge from big data, innovative
approaches for image reconstruction, and superior performance in clinical and
preclinical applications. To realize the full impact of machine learning on
medical imaging, major challenges must be addressed.

fuzzy-valued functions. Several examples are worked out to check that
fuzzy-valued functions are one time, two times and n-times H-differentiable. We
study the effects of fuzzy modelling on existence of Hukuhara differentiability
of fuzzy-valued functions. We discuss existence of gH-differentiability and its
comparison with H-differentiability.

the critical line, is extended over the complex plane. Significant results
include a simpler derivation of the fundamental equation developed previously,
and its generalization from the critical line to the complex plane. A simpler
statement of the relationship that exists between the real and imaginary
components of $\zeta(s)$ and $\zeta^{\prime}(s)$ on opposing sides of the
critical line is developed, reducing to a simpler statement of the same result
on the critical line. An analytic expression is obtained for the sum of the
arguments of $\zeta(s)$ on opposite sides of the critical line, reducing to the
analytic expression for $arg(\zeta(1/2+i\rho))$ first obtained in the previous
work. Relationships are obtained between various combinations of $|\zeta(s)|$
and $|\zeta^{\prime}(s)|$, particularly on the critical line, and it is
demonstrated that $arg(\zeta(1/2+i\rho))$ and $arg(\zeta^{\prime}(1/2+i\rho))$
uniquely define $|\zeta(1/2+i\rho)|$. A comment is made about the utility of
such results as they might apply to putative proofs of Riemann's Hypothesis
(RH).

mother to child transmission, sharing of unsterilized objects that is capable
of making cut or wounds on the body, through blood or bodily fluid
transmission. AIDS has no permanent cure but remedies that help in suppressing
the power effect of the virus are available. Previous studies has shown that
the epidemic claimed more lives via vertical transmission, mother-to-child
transmission, blood transfusion, sexual intercourse and injection drug users.
The associated models were derived using diagnosis and treatments records of
confirmed status of HIV/AIDS clients. A new model analysis were proposed that
could handle cases of HIV/AIDS routes of transmission and treatments via
vertical, mother-to-child, blood transfusion, sexual intercourse, injection
drug users that were not considered in previous studies. The new model was
solved using Fractional Differential Transformation by Caputo sense algorithm.
The new model is a major contribution for optimal assessment, monitoring,
evaluation, control and management of HIV/AIDS, with 75% accuracy.

system, whose effective potential in the radial direction yields a
supersymmetric partner of the radial harmonic oscillator, is constructed by
including new long-range interactions to the rational Calogero model. An
infinite number of bound state energy levels are obtained for this system under
certain conditions. We also calculate the corresponding bound state wave
functions in terms of the recently discovered exceptional orthogonal Laguerre
