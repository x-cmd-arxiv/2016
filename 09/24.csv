to four salt treatments 0, 50, 100 and 150 mM NaCl, plant growth and proline
concentration in leaves were assessed. The analyzed data revealed significant
variability in salt response within and between the two species, depending on
the salinity level. It was found that high NaCl concentrations affected all the
growth parameters. However, the reduction was more important at higher NaCl
concentrations and the highest reduction was obtained for the populations of
Medicago polymorpha where it reached around 90% in root length at 150 mM NaCl
for Pmar. The Tunisian population of Medicago ciliaris, prospected on soils
affected by salinity, was the best tolerant in all ecotypes studied in this
work. This population, exhibits a particular adaptability to salt environment
at both germination and seedling stage. Furthermore, the correlation among the
studied plants sensitivity and leaf proline concentration showed that high
proline contents were related to their reactivity to salt. Consequently, it
appeared that proline biosynthesis occurred presumably as a consequence of
disturbance in cell homoeostasis and reflected poor performance and greater
damage in response to salt stress. These findings indicated that this osmolytes
content may be used as another useful criterion to differentiate salt-tolerant
from salt sensitive plant in annual medics.

prominent role in modern machine learning with numerous applications in areas
such as large scale classification, neural language modeling and recommendation

inference because of the high cost associated with computing the normalizing
constant. Here, we introduce an efficient approximation to softmax
probabilities which takes the form of a rigorous lower bound on the exact
probability. This bound is expressed as a product over pairwise probabilities
and it leads to scalable estimation based on stochastic optimization. It allows
us to perform doubly stochastic estimation by subsampling both training
instances and class labels. We show that the new bound has interesting
theoretical properties and we demonstrate its use in classification problems.

inertial number (inversely proportional to pressure), can alternatively be
expressed as inversely proportional to the square root of the particle
stiffness. Asymptotic scaling relations for the field variables pressure, shear
stress and granular temperature are inferred from simulations in both fluid and
solid regimes, corresponding to unjammed and jammed conditions. Then the limit
cases are merged to unique constitutive relations that cover also the
transition zone in proximity of jamming. By exploiting the diverging behavior
of the scaling laws at the jamming density, we arrive at continuous and
differentiable phenomenological constitutive relations for the stresses and the
granular temperature as functions of the volume fraction, shear rate, particle
stiffness and distance from jamming. In contrast to steady shear flows of hard
particles the (shear) stress ratio does not collapse as a function of the

accretion, fragmentation and radiative feedback. Different simulations predict
different initial mass functions of the first stars, ranging from predominantly
low mass (0.1-10 Msol), to massive (10-100 Msol), or even supermassive
(100-1000 Msol). The mass distribution of the first stars should lead to unique
chemical imprints on the low-mass second and later generation metal-poor stars
still in existence. The chemical composition of SMSS0313-6708, which has the
lowest abundances of Ca and Fe of any star known, indicates it was enriched by
a single massive supernova. However, even weak spectral lines may be affected
by strong 3D and NLTE effects in metal-poor stars. If these effects are ignored
or treated incorrectly, errors in the inferred abundances may significantly
bias the inferred properties of the polluting supernovae. We redetermine the
chemical composition of SMSS0313-6708 using 3D NLTE radiative transfer to
obtain accurate abundances for Li, Na, Mg, Al, Ca and Fe. The model atoms
employ realistic collisional rates, with no calibrated free parameters. We find
significantly higher abundances in 3D NLTE than 1D LTE by 0.8 dex for Fe, and
0.5 dex for Mg, Al and Ca, while Li and Na are unaffected to within 0.03 dex.
In particular, our upper limit for [Fe/H] is now a factor ten larger, at [Fe/H]
< -6.53 (3 sigma), than previous estimates based on <3D> NLTE (i.e. using
averaged 3D models). This higher estimate is due to a conservative upper limit
estimation, updated NLTE data, and 3D-<3D> NLTE differences, all of which lead
to a higher abundance determination. We find that the revised chemical
composition of SMSS0313-6708 matches supernova yields for massive progenitors

group (fRG) for inhomogeneous systems capable of dealing with spatially
finite-ranged interactions. In the general third order truncated form of fRG,
the dependence of the two-particle vertex is described by O(N^4) independent
variables, where N is the dimension of the single-particle system. In a
previous paper [Phys. Rev. B 89, 045128 (2014)], the so-called coupled-ladder
approximation (CLA) was introduced and shown to admit a consistent treatment
for models with a purely onsite interaction, reducing the vertex to O(N^2)
independent variables. Here, we extend this scheme to the extended coupled
ladder approximation (eCLA), which includes a spatially extended feedback
between the individual channels, measured by a feedback length L, using O(N^2
L^2) independent variables for the vertex. We apply the eCLA to three types of
one-dimensional models : First, to a quantum point contact (QPC) with a
parabolic barrier top and short-ranged interactions. Here eCLA achieves
convergence for L equal to the characteristic length l_x of the QPC. It also
turns out that the additional feedback stabilizes the fRG-flow. This enables
us, second, to study the crossover between a QPC and a quantum dot, again for a
model with short-ranged interactions. Third, the enlarged feedback also enables
the treatment of a finite-ranged interaction extending over up to L sites.
Estimating the form of such a finite-ranged interaction in a QPC, we study its
effects on the conductance and the density. For low densities and sufficiently
large interaction ranges the conductance develops additional oscillatory
features, and the corresponding density shows fluctuations that can be
interpreted as Friedel oscillations arising from a renormalized barrier shape
with a rather flat top and steep flanks.

understanding of the role played by the bacterial growth on the organoleptic
properties, and for the quality evaluation and risk assessment of food
products. We therefore analyze the time behaviour, in fresh fish specimens, of
sensory characteristics starting from the growth curves of two spoilage
bacterial communities. The theoretical study, initially based on a
deterministic model, exploits experimental temperature profiles. As a first
step, a model of predictive microbiology is used to reproduce the experimental
behaviour of the two bacterial populations. Afterwards, the theoretical
bacterial growths are converted, through suitable differential equations, into
""sensory"" scores, based on the Quality Index Method (QIM), a scoring system for
freshness and quality sensory estimation of fishery products. As a third step,
the theoretical curves of QIM scores are compared with the experimental data

scores are modified by adding terms of multiplicative white noise, which mimics
the effects of uncertainty and variability in sensory analysis. A better

optimization algorithms with adaptive step sizes. This framework is based on
analyzing properties of an underlying generic stochastic process, in particular
by deriving a bound on the expected stopping time of this process. We utilize
this framework to analyze the bounds on expected global convergence rates of a
stochastic variant of a traditional trust region method, introduced in
\cite{ChenMenickellyScheinberg2014}. While traditional trust region methods
rely on exact computations of the gradient, Hessian and values of the objective
function, this method assumes that these values are available up to some
dynamically adjusted accuracy. Moreover, this accuracy is assumed to hold only
with some sufficiently large, but fixed, probability, without any additional
restrictions on the variance of the errors. This setting applies, for example,
to standard stochastic optimization and machine learning formulations.
Improving upon the analysis in \cite{ChenMenickellyScheinberg2014}, we show
that the stochastic process defined by the algorithm satisfies the assumptions
of our proposed general framework, with the stopping time defined as reaching
accuracy $\|\nabla f(x)\|\leq \epsilon$. The resulting bound for this stopping
time is $O(\epsilon^{-2})$, under the assumption of sufficiently accurate
stochastic gradient, and is the first global complexity bound for a stochastic

  Imaging",,,,"cs.NA math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fourier domain structured low-rank matrix priors are emerging as powerful
alternatives to traditional image recovery methods such as total variation and
wavelet regularization. These priors specify that a convolutional structured
matrix, i.e., Toeplitz, Hankel, or their multi-level generalizations, built
from Fourier data of the image should be low-rank. The main challenge in
applying these schemes to large-scale problems is the computational complexity
and memory demand resulting from lifting the image data to a large scale
matrix. We introduce a fast and memory efficient approach called the Generic
Iterative Reweighted Annihilation Filter (GIRAF) algorithm that exploits the
convolutional structure of the lifted matrix to work in the original un-lifted
domain, thus considerably reducing the complexity. Our experiments on the
recovery of images from undersampled Fourier measurements show that the
resulting algorithm is considerably faster than previously proposed algorithms,
and can accommodate much larger problem sizes than previously studied.

a prominent and very broad Na I D doublet. We find that no single, ordinary

is an unresolved binary system of an M7 dwarf and a cool white dwarf. The flux
of a cool white dwarf drops in the optical red and near-infrared, due to
collision-induced absorption, thus allowing the flux of a late-M dwarf to show
through. This scenario, however, does not explain the Na D feature, which is
unlike that of any known white dwarf, but which could perhaps be explained via
unusual abundance or pressure conditions.

yaw motions is used in connection with the Routh procedure in order to convert
the original dynamical problem into a reduced one, in three independent
variables. This allows to put on rational grounds the study of hydrostatic
equilibrium, introducing the concept of pseudo--stability, meant as stability
with respect to the reduced problem. The small oscillations of the system

variability in time evolution of proteins. Consequently, events that trigger at
critical threshold levels of regulatory proteins exhibit stochasticity in their
timing. An important contributor to the noise in gene expression is translation
bursts which correspond to randomness in number of proteins produced in a
single mRNA lifetime. Modeling timing of an event as a first-passage time (FPT)
problem, we explore the effect of burst size distribution on event timing.
Towards this end, the probability density function of FPT is computed for a
gene expression model with burst size drawn from a generic non-negative
distribution. Analytical formulas for FPT moments are provided in terms of
known vectors and inverse of a matrix. The effect of burst size distribution is
investigated by looking at how the feedback regulation strategy that minimizes
noise in timing around a given time deviates from the case when burst is
deterministic. Interestingly, results show that the feedback strategy for
deterministic burst case is quite robust to change in burst size distribution,
and deviations from it are confined to about 20% of the optimal value. These
findings facilitate an improved understanding of noise regulation in event
timing.

extending BART to clustered or longitudinal data are available, they lack

the Schwarzschild solution is not a vacuum solution for $F(T)\neq T$ and

the scenario with $F(T)=T + (\alpha/2)\, T^{2}$, representing the dominant

study the instances when the strategy is discreet, and given an outcome of the
sorting strategy, the possible number of fake coins. We prove that in many
cases, the number of fake coins can be any value in an arithmetic progression
whose length depends linearly on the number of coins in each pile. We also show
the strategy can be discreet when the number of fake coins is any value within

order-two crystal symmetries (reflection and twofold rotation), focusing on the
case where interactions reduce the noninteracting classification. We find that
the free-fermion $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classifications are stable against quartic
contact interactions, whereas the $\mathbb{Z}$ classifications reduce to
$\mathbb{Z}_N$, where $N$ depends on the symmetry class and the dimension $d$.
These results are derived using a quantum nonlinear $\sigma$ model (QNLSM) that
describes the effects of the quartic interactions on the boundary modes of the
crystalline topological phases. We use Clifford algebra extensions to derive
the target spaces of these QNLSMs in a unified way. The reduction pattern of
the free-fermion classification then follows from the presence or absence of
topological terms in the QNLSMs, which is determined by the homotopy group of
the target spaces. We show that this derivation can be performed using either a
complex fermion or a real Majorana representation of the crystalline
topological phases and demonstrate that these two representations give
consistent results. To illustrate the breakdown of the noninteracting
classification we present examples of crystalline topological insulators and
superconductors in dimensions one, two, and three, whose surfaces modes are
unstable against interactions. For the three-dimensional example, we show that
the reduction pattern obtained by the QNLSM method agrees with the one inferred
from the stability analysis of the boundary modes using bosonization.

the asymptotic variance of the weighted average treatment effect among the

when the training data is comprised of lower-dimensional projections of the
original feature space. The main goal is the discovery of a set of 3-D bases
poses that can characterize the manifold of primitive human motions, or
movemes, from a training set of 2-D projected poses obtained from still images
taken at various camera angles. The proposed technique for basis discovery is
data-driven rather than hand-designed. The learned representation is rotation
invariant, and can reconstruct any training instance from multiple viewing
angles. We apply our method to modeling human poses in sports (via the Leeds
Sports Dataset), and demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned bases in a
range of applications such as activity classification, inference of dynamics
from a single frame, and synthetic representation of movements.

can be used to describe the evolution of a quantum state $\rho$ when in contact
with a memoryless thermal bath. This approach has had much success in
describing the dynamics of real-life open quantum systems in the lab. Such
dynamics increase the entropy of the state $\rho$ and the bath until both
systems reach thermal equilibrium, at which point entropy production stops. Our
main result is to show that the entropy production at time $t$ is bounded by
the relative entropy between the original state and the state at time $2t$. The
bound puts strong constraints on how quickly a state can thermalise, and we
prove that the factor of $2$ is tight. The proof makes use of a key physically
relevant property of these dynamical semigroups -- detailed balance, showing
that this property is intimately connected with the field of recovery maps from
quantum information theory. We envisage that the connections made here between
the two fields will have further applications. We also use this connection to
show that a similar relation can be derived when the fixed point is not
thermal.

most existing results using formal methods usually assumed an ideal
inter-vehicle communication, which is far from the real world situation. Hence,
we are motivated to close the gap by explicitly considering non-deterministic
time delay and packet dropout due to unreliable inter-vehicle communications.
In particular, we consider a passive safety property, which requests a vehicle
to avoid any collisions that can be considered as its fault. Under the
assumption that the communication delay is bounded and we know the upper bound,
we then formally verify the passivity safety of a class of hybrid CACC systems.
This result allows us to define a safe control envelope that will guide the
synthesis of control signals. Vehicles under the CACC within the safe control
envelope are guaranteed to avoid active collisions.

quantum entanglement, even in the absence of interactions. In particular, the
usual case of a codimension one Fermi surface leads to a logarithmic violation
of the area law for entanglement entropy, as dictated by the Widom formula. We
here generalize this formula to the case of arbitrary codimension, which is of
particular interest for nodal lines in three dimensions. We first rederive the
standard Widom formula by calculating an entanglement Hamiltonian for Fermi
surface systems, obtained by repurposing a trick commonly applied to
relativistic theories. The entanglement Hamiltonian will take a local form in
terms of a low-energy patch theory for the Fermi surface, though it is nonlocal
with respect to the microscopic fermions. This entanglement Hamiltonian can
then be used to derive the entanglement entropy, yielding a result in agreement
with the Widom formula. The method is then generalized to arbitrary
codimension. For nodal lines, the area law is obeyed, and the magnitude of the
coefficient for a particular partition is non-universal. However, the
coefficient has a universal dependence on the shape and orientation of the
nodal line relative to the partitioning surface. By comparing the relative
magnitude of the area law for different partitioning cuts, entanglement entropy
can be used as a tool for diagnosing the presence and shape of a nodal line in
a ground state wavefunction.

fragments, dust grain dynamics, and planet evolutionary calculations are
summarised here and used to build a predictive planet formation model and
population synthesis. A new interpretation of exoplanetary and debris disc
data, the Solar System's origins, and the links between planets and brown
dwarfs is offered. This interpretation is contrasted with the current
observations and the predictions of the Core Accretion theory. Observations
that can distinguish the two scenarios are pointed out. In particular, Tidal
Downsizing predicts that presence of debris discs, sub-Neptune mass planets,
planets more massive than $\sim 5$~Jupiter masses and brown dwarfs should not
correlate strongly with the metallicity of the host. For gas giants of $\sim$
Saturn to a few Jupiter mass, a strong host star metallicity correlation is
predicted only inwards of a few AU from the host. Composition of massive cores
is predicted to be dominated by rock rather than ices. Debris discs made by
Tidal Downsizing are distinct from those made by Core Accretion at birth: they
have an innermost edge always larger than about 1 au, have smaller total masses
and are usually in a dynamically excited state. It is argued that planet
formation in surprisingly young or very dynamic systems such as HL Tau and
Kepler-444 may be a signature of Tidal Downsizing. Open questions and potential
weaknesses of the hypothesis are pointed out.

quasi-one-dimensional classical lattice waveguide with mass disorder, and show
that the TPE mode transmission remains highly robust ($\Xi\sim1$) in the
presence of uncorrelated disorder, but diminishes when disorder is spatially
correlated. This reduction in transmittance is attributed to the Anderson
localization of states within the mass disorder domains. By contrast, non-TPE
channels exhibit qualitatively different behavior, with spatial correlation in
the mass disorder leading to significant transmittance reduction (enhancement)
at low (high) frequencies. Our results demonstrate how topologically protected

However, the corresponding approximation error can be substantial. In this

with the problem dimensions. Specifically, when the ambiguity set constitutes a
2-Wasserstein ball centered at a discrete distribution, then the
distributionally robust linear program is equivalent to a copositive program
(if the problem has complete recourse) or can be approximated arbitrarily
closely by a sequence of copositive programs (if the problem has sufficiently
expensive recourse). These results directly extend to the classical robust
setting and motivate strong tractable approximations of two-stage problems
based on semidefinite approximations of the copositive cone. We also
demonstrate that the two-stage distributionally robust optimization problem is

metal-poor inner MW stars (divided at [Fe/H] = -0.4), and comparing the
observed patterns to those that are seen both in N-body models and in

the models do not reproduce the observed LOSVD skewness patterns in different

structure of the inner MW remains an important regime for improvement. We find
evidence in the MW of the skewness-velocity correlation that is used as a
diagnostic of extragalactic bar/bulges. This correlation appears in metal-rich
stars only, providing further evidence for different evolutionary histories of
chemically differentiated populations. We connect these skewness measurements
to previous work on high-velocity ""peaks"" in the inner Galaxy, confirming the

space is often analyzed by computing the persistence diagram or barcodes of a
sequence of Rips complexes built on $P$ indexed by a scale parameter.
Unfortunately, even for input of moderate size, the size of the Rips complex
may become prohibitively large as the scale parameter increases. Starting with
the Sparse Rips filtration introduced by Sheehy, some existing methods aim to
reduce the size of the complex so as to improve the time efficiency as well.
However, as we demonstrate, existing approaches still fall short of scaling
well, especially for high dimensional data. In this paper, we investigate the
advantages and limitations of existing approaches. Based on insights gained
from the experiments, we propose an efficient new algorithm, called SimBa, for
approximating the persistent homology of Rips filtrations with quality
guarantees. Our new algorithm leverages a batch collapse strategy as well as a
new sparse Rips-like filtration. We experiment on a variety of low and high
dimensional data sets. We show that our strategy presents a significant size

  models","15 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we propose a Kronecker-based modeling for identifying the
spatial-temporal dynamics of large sensor arrays. The class of Kronecker
networks is defined for which we formulate a Vector Autoregressive model. Its
coefficient-matrices are decomposed into a sum of Kronecker products. For a
two-dimensional array of size $N \times N$, and when the number of terms in the
sum is small compared to $N$, exploiting the Kronecker structure leads to high
data compression. We propose an Alternating Least Squares algorithm to identify
the coefficient matrices with $\mathcal{O}(N^3N_t)$, where $N_t$ is the number
of temporal samples, instead of $\mathcal{O}(N^6)$ in the unstructured case.
This framework moreover allows for a convenient integration of more structure
(e.g sparse, banded, Toeplitz) on the factor matrices. Numerical examples on
atmospheric turbulence data has shown comparable performances with the
unstructured least-squares estimation while the number of parameters is growing
only linearly w.r.t. the number of nodes instead of quadratically in the full
unstructured matrix case.

information with certain probability from nodes that possess it to their

of a set of initial nodes (seeds) results in diffusion to large number of
nodes. Here, several novel approaches for seed initiation that replace the
commonly used activation of all seeds at once with a sequence of initiation
stages are introduced. Sequential strategies at later stages avoid seeding
highly ranked nodes that are already activated by diffusion active between
stages. The gain arises when a saved seed is allocated to a node difficult to
reach via diffusion. Sequential seeding and a single stage approach are
compared using various seed ranking methods and diffusion parameters on real
complex networks. The experimental results indicate that, regardless of the
seed ranking method used, sequential seeding strategies deliver better coverage
than single stage seeding in about 90% of cases. Longer seeding sequences tend
to activate more nodes but they also extend the duration of diffusion. Various
variants of sequential seeding resolve the trade-off between the coverage and

observations, random time-varying mixed observations, and deterministic
time-varying mixed observations. For our error exponent characterization, we
introduce the notions of inner conditional Chernoff information and outer
conditional Chernoff information. It is demonstrated that mixed observations
can strictly improve the error exponents of hypothesis testing, over separate
observations of individual random variables. We further characterize the
optimal sensing vector maximizing the error exponents, which leads to explicit
constructions of the optimal mixed observations in special cases of hypothesis
testing for Gaussian random variables. These results show that mixed
observations of random variables can reduce the number of required samples in
hypothesis testing applications. In order to solve large-scale hypothesis

the emergent magnetic field is topological. This means that the topological

instantaneously whether communication is needed or not, free slots cannot be

predictive and self triggering protocols are proposed, which give the
communication system time to adapt and reallocate freed resources. From a
unified Bayesian decision framework, two schemes are developed: self-triggers
that predict, at the current triggering instant, the next one; and predictive
triggers that indicate, at every time step, whether communication will be
needed at a given prediction horizon. The effectiveness of the proposed
triggers in trading off estimation quality for communication reduction is

reduced, compared to existing predictor based LPV subspace identification

representation are multi-linear in the scheduling signal and its time-shifts,
contrary to the predictor based schemes where the corresponding LPV
auto-regressive with exogenous inputs system is multi-quadratic in the
scheduling signal and its time-shifts. In this paper, we will prove that under
certain conditions on the input and scheduling signals, the $\ell_2$ loss
function of the one-step-ahead prediction error for the LPV-MAX model has only
one unique minimum, corresponding to the original underlying system. Hence,
identifying the LPV-MAX model in the prediction error minimization framework
will be consistent and unbiased. The LPV-SS model is realized by applying an
efficient basis reduced Ho-Kalman realization on the identified LPV-MAX model.
The performance of the proposed scheme is assessed on a Monte Carlo simulation

0716+71 suggest a helical structure for the jet. The geometrical parameters of
a model helical jet are determined. It is shown that, when the trajectories of
the jet components are non-ballistic, the angle between their velocity vectors
and the line of sight lies in a broader interval than is the case for ballistic
motions of the components, in agreement with available estimates. The
contradictory results for the apparent speeds of components in the inner and
outer jet at epochs 2004 and 2008-2010 can be explained in such a model. The
ratio of the apparent speeds in the inner and outer jet is used to derive a
lower limit for the true speed of the components ($\beta>0.999$) and to
determine the pitch angle of the helical jet ($p=5.5^\circ$). The derived
parameters can give rise to the conditions required to observe high speeds
(right to 37$c$) for individual jet components.

  Knowledge Management (CIKM 2016)",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The staggering amount of streaming time series coming from the real world
calls for more efficient and effective online modeling solution. For time
series modeling, most existing works make some unrealistic assumptions such as
the input data is of fixed length or well aligned, which requires extra effort
on segmentation or normalization of the raw streaming data. Although some
literature claim their approaches to be invariant to data length and
misalignment, they are too time-consuming to model a streaming time series in
an online manner. We propose a novel and more practical online modeling and
classification scheme, DDE-MGM, which does not make any assumptions on the time
series while maintaining high efficiency and state-of-the-art performance. The
derivative delay embedding (DDE) is developed to incrementally transform time
series to the embedding space, where the intrinsic characteristics of data is
preserved as recursive patterns regardless of the stream length and
misalignment. Then, a non-parametric Markov geographic model (MGM) is proposed
to both model and classify the pattern in an online manner. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior classification accuracy of
the proposed DDE-MGM in an online setting as compared to the state-of-the-art.

The peak HI surface densities in GLSB galaxies are several times 10^21 cm^{-2}
. The HI mass is between 0.3 - 4 x 10^10 M_Sun/yr, dynamical mass ranges from a
few times 10^11 M_Sun/yr to a few times 10^12 M_Sun/yr. (2) The rotation curves
of GLSB galaxies are flat to the outermost measured point with rotation
velocities of the seven GLSB galaxies being between 225 and 432 km s^{-1}. (3)
Recent star formation traced by near-ultraviolet emission in five GLSB galaxies

suggest that this could be due to a stochastic burst of star formation at one
location in the galaxy being propagated along a ring over a rotation period.

galaxy with a new treatment for dust formation and destruction. To this aim, we
treat dust and metal production self-consistently with star formation and
supernova feedback. For dust, we consider a simplified model of grain size
distribution by representing the entire range of grain sizes with large and
small grains. We include dust production in stellar ejecta, dust destruction by
supernova (SN) shocks, grain growth by accretion and coagulation, and grain
disruption by shattering. We find that the assumption of fixed dust-to-metal
mass ratio becomes no longer valid when the galaxy is older than 0.2 Gyr, at
which point the grain growth by accretion starts to contribute to the nonlinear
rise of dust-to-gas ratio. As expected in our previous one-zone model,
shattering triggers grain growth by accretion since it increases the total
surface area of grains. Coagulation becomes significant when the galaxy age is
greater than $\sim$ 1 Gyr: at this epoch the abundance of small grains becomes
high enough to raise the coagulation rate of small grains. We further compare
the radial profiles of dust-to-gas ratio $(\mathcal{D})$ and dust-to-metal
ratio $(\mathcal{D}/Z)$ (i.e., depletion) at various ages with observational
data. We find that our simulations broadly reproduce the radial gradients of
dust-to-gas ratio and depletion. In the early epoch ($\lesssim 0.3$ Gyr), the
radial gradient of $\mathcal{D}$ follows the metallicity gradient with
$\mathcal{D}/Z$ determined by the dust condensation efficiency in stellar
ejecta, while the $\mathcal{D}$ gradient is steeper than the $Z$ gradient at
the later epochs because of grain growth by accretion. The framework developed
in this paper is applicable to any SPH-based galaxy evolution simulations
including cosmological ones.

stopping times and hitting times. In contrast, there is no known analog for the
$L_{2}$ mixing time, $\tau_{2}$ (while there are sophisticated analytic tools
to bound $ \tau_2$, in general they do not determine $\tau_2$ up to a constant
factor and they lack a probabilistic interpretation). In this work we show that
$\tau_2$ can be characterized up to a constant factor using hitting times

Log-Sobolev constant, $c_{\mathrm{LS}}$, as a weighted version of the spectral
gap. This characterization yields a probabilistic interpretation of
$c_{\mathrm{LS}}$ in terms of a hitting time version of hypercontractivity. As
applications of our results, we show that (1) for every reversible Markov
chain, $\tau_2$ is robust under addition of self-loops with bounded weights,
and (2) for weighted nearest neighbor random walks on trees, $\tau_2 $ is
robust under bounded perturbations of the edge weights.

trading and fair benefit sharing. We solve the bargaining problem by
decomposing it into two sequential problems on social cost minimization and
trading benefit sharing, respectively. For practical implementation, we propose
a decentralized solution method with minimum information exchange overhead.
Numerical studies based on realistic data demonstrate that the total cost of
the interconnected-microgrids operation can be reduced by up to 13.2% through
energy trading, and an individual participating microgrid can achieve up to
29.4% reduction in its cost through energy trading.

derive a simple, but general criterion that allows one to identify quantum

the characterization of steerable quantum states. The criterion, in turn, also
provides upper bounds on the largest steering-inequality violation achievable
by arbitrary finite-dimensional maximally entangled states. For the
quantification of steerability, we prove that a strengthened version of the
steering fraction is a convex steering monotone and demonstrate how it is
related to two others, namely, steerable weight and steering robustness. Using
these tools, we further demonstrate the superactivation of steerability, i.e.,
we show how the steerability of certain entangled, but unsteerable quantum

the same state. In particular, our approach allows one to explicitly construct
a steering inequality to manifest this phenomenon. Finally, we prove that there
exist quantum states (including some unsteerable under projective measurements)

joint measurements on three copies of the same state. For completeness, we also
demonstrate how the largest steering-inequality violation can be used to bound
the largest Bell-inequality violation and derive, analogously, a simple

hands. A typical approach learns the target locations of finger links on the
object. When a new object must be grasped, new finger locations are generated,
and a collision free reach-to-grasp trajectory is planned. This assumes a
collision free trajectory to the final grasp. This is not possible with
underactuated hands, which cannot be guaranteed to avoid contact, and in fact
exploit contacts with the object during grasping, so as to reach an equilibrium
state in which the object is held securely. Unfortunately, these contact
interactions are i) not directly controllable, and ii) hard to monitor during a
real grasp. We overcome these problems so as to permit learning of
transferrable grasps for underactuated hands. We make two main technical
innovations. First, we model contact interactions during the grasp implicitly.
We do this by modelling motor commands that lead reliably to the equilibrium
state, rather than modelling contact changes themselves. This alters our
reach-to-grasp model. Second, we extend our contact model learning algorithm to
work with multiple training examples for each grasp type. This requires the
ability to learn which parts of the hand reliably interact with the object
during a particular grasp. Our approach learns from a rigid body simulation.
This enables us to learn how to approach the object and close the underactuated
hand from a variety of poses. From nine training grasps on three objects the
method transferred grasps to previously unseen, novel objects, that differ
significantly from the training objects, with an 80% success rate.

for wavenumbers smaller than a given bound $k_{\star}$ depending on the
geometry, we cannot have $T=1$ so that the observer can detect the presence of
the defect if he/she is able to measure the phase at $+\infty$. In particular,
if the perturbation is smooth and small (in amplitude and in width),
$k_{\star}$ is very close to the threshold wavenumber. Then, in a second step,
we change the point of view and, for a given wavenumber, working with singular
perturbations of the domain, we show how to obtain $T=1$. In this case, the
scattered field is exponentially decaying both at $-\infty$ and $+\infty$. We
implement numerically the method to provide examples of such undetectable
defects.

mapping data, yielding highly precise maps. It uses several concepts to achieve
scalability. First, an efficient graph-based pre-segmentation is used, which
directly operates on LiDAR scan strip data, rather than on point clouds.
Second, observation equations are obtained from a dense matching, which is
formulated in terms of an estimation of a latent map. As a result of this
formulation, the number of observation equations is not quadratic, but rather
linear in the number of scan strips. Third, the dynamic Bayes network, which
results from all observation and condition equations, is partitioned into two
sub-networks. Consequently, the estimation matrices for all position and
orientation corrections are linear instead of quadratic in the number of
unknowns and can be solved very efficiently using an alternating least squares
approach. It is shown how this approach can be mapped to a standard key/value
MapReduce implementation, where each of the processing nodes operates
independently on small chunks of data, leading to essentially linear
scalability. Results are demonstrated for a dataset of one billion measured
LiDAR points and 278,000 unknowns, leading to maps with a precision of a few

trajectory regularity (almost everywhere) and asymptotic Kac limit, namely the
convergence towards Brownian motion (and to stochastic dynamics driven by
Wiener perturbations), which characterizes also the long-term/long-distance
properties of these processes. In this article we introduce the structural
properties of GPK processes, leaving all the physical implications to part II

state variable, similarly to the case of nonlinear Langevin equations, and (ii)
as the dependence of the stochastic microdynamic equations of motion on the
statistical description of the process itself (nonlinear Fokker-Planck-Kac
models). Several numerical and physical examples illustrate the theory.
Gathering nonlinearity and a continuum of states, GPK theory provides a
stochastic derivation of the nonlinear Boltzmann equation, furnishing a

Experiments were carried out on five benchmark data sets, and the proposed

Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.3847/0004-6256/152/6/204",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  HD 179070, aka Kepler-21, is a V = 8.25 F6IV star and the brightest exoplanet
host discovered by Kepler. An early detailed analysis by Howell et al. (2012)
of the first thirteen months (Q0 - Q5) of Kepler light curves revealed transits
of a planetary companion, Kepler-21b, with a radius of about 1.60 +/- 0.04
R_earth and an orbital period of about 2.7857 days. However, they could not
determine the mass of the planet from the initial radial velocity observations
with Keck-HIRES, and were only able to impose a 2-sigma upper limit of 10
M_earth. Here we present results from the analysis of 82 new radial velocity
observations of this system obtained with HARPS-N, together with the existing
14 HIRES data points. We detect the Doppler signal of Kepler-21b with a radial
velocity semi-amplitude K = 2.00 +/- 0.65 m/s, which corresponds to a planetary
mass of 5.1 +/- 1.7 M_earth. We also measure an improved radius for the planet
of 1.639 (+0.019, -0.015) R_earth, in agreement with the radius reported by
Howell et al. (2012). We conclude that Kepler-21b, with a density of 6.4 +/-
2.1 g/cm^3, belongs to the population of terrestrial planets with iron,
magnesium silicate interiors, which have lost the majority of their envelope
volatiles via stellar winds or gravitational escape. The radial velocity
analysis presented in this paper serves as example of the type of analysis that
will be necessary to confirm the masses of TESS small planet candidates.

theoretical description for the behaviour of rings in dense solutions and
melts. Although it is nowadays well established that the overall size of a ring
in these conditions scales like that of a collapsed globule, there is
compelling evidence that rings may exhibit ramified and tree-like
conformations. In this work I show how to characterise these local tree-like
structures by measuring the local writhing of the rings' segments and by
identifying the patterns of intra-chain contacts. These quantities reveal two
major topological structures: loops and terminal branches which strongly
suggest that the strictly double-folded ""lattice animal"" picture for rings in
the melt may be replaced by a more relaxed tree-like structure accommodating
loops. In particular, I show that one can identify hierarchically looped
structures whose degree increases linearly with the size of a ring, and that
terminal branches are found to store about 30% of the whole ring mass,
irrespectively of its length. Finally, I draw an analogy between rings in the
melt and slip-linked chains, where contact points are enforced by mobile
slip-links and for which a field-theoretic treatment can be employed to get
some insight into their typical conformations. These findings are ultimately
discussed in the light of recent works on the static structure of rings and on
the existence of inter-ring threadings.

of early Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs). While $\gtrsim$100 IMBH and small
SMBH candidates have been identified in recent years, few have been robustly
confirmed to date, leaving their number density in considerable doubt. Placing
firmer constraints both on the methods used to identify and confirm
IMBHs/SMBHs, as well as characterizing the range of host environments that
IMBHs/SMBHs likely inhabit is therefore of considerable interest and
importance. Additionally, finding significant numbers of IMBHs in metal-poor
systems would be particularly intriguing, since such systems may represent
local analogs of primordial galaxies, and therefore could provide clues of
early accretion processes.
  $Aims:$ Here we study in detail several candidate Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN) found in metal-poor hosts.
  $Methods:$ We utilize new X-ray and optical observations to characterize
these metal-poor AGN candidates and compare them against known AGN luminosity
relations and well-characterized IMBH/SMBH samples.
  $Results:$ Despite having clear broad optical emission lines that are
long-lived ($\gtrsim$10--13\,yr), these candidate AGN appear to lack associated
strong X-ray and hard UV emission, lying at least 1--2 dex off the known AGN
correlations. If they are IMBHs/SMBHs, our constraints imply that they either
are not actively accreting, their accretion disks are fully obscured along our
line-of-sight, or their accretion disks are not producing characteristic high
energy emission. Alternatively, if they are not AGN, then their luminous broad
emission lines imply production by extreme stellar processes. The latter would
have profound implications on the applicability of broad lines for mass
estimates of massive black holes.

phenomena at multiple length scales. The moisture or temperature induced
expansion of individual fibres is transmitted in the network through the
inter-fibre bonds; particularly in the case of anisotropic fibres, this
substantially influences the resulting overall deformation. This paper presents
a methodology to predict the effective properties of bonded fibrous networks.
The distinctive features of the work are i) the focus on the
hygro-thermo-mechanical response, whereas in the literature generally only the
mechanical properties are addressed; ii) the adoption of asymptotic
homogenization to model fibrous networks. Asymptotic homogenization is an
efficient and versatile multi-scale technique that allows to obtain within a
rigorous setting the effective material response, even for complex
micro-structural geometries. The fibrous networks considered in this
investigation are generated by random deposition of the fibres within a planar
region according to an orientation probability density function. Most of the
available network descriptions model the fibres essentially as uni-axial
elements, thereby not explicitly considering the role of the bonds. In this
paper, the fibres are treated as two dimensional ribbon-like elements; this
allows to naturally include the contribution of the bonding regions to the
effective expansion. The efficacy of the proposed study is illustrated by
investigating the effective response for several network realizations,
incorporating the influence of different micro-scale parameters, such as fibre
hygro-thermo-elastic properties, orientation, geometry, areal coverage.

hygro-expansion, the functional dependence of the effective material properties

micro-structural model of the paper fibrous network is first developed by
random deposition of the fibres within a planar region according to an
orientation probability density function. Asymptotic homogenization is used to
determine its effective properties numerically. Alternatively, two much more
idealized micro-structural models are considered, one based on a periodic
lattice structure with a regular network of perpendicular fibres and one based
on the Voigt average. Despite their simplicity, they reproduce representative
micro-structural features, such as the orientation anisotropy and network level
hygro-elastic properties. These alternative models can be solved analytically,
providing closed-form expressions that explicitly reveal the influence of the
individual micro-scale parameters on the effective hygro-mechanical response.
The trend predicted by the random network model is captured reasonably well by
the two idealized models. The resulting hygro-mechanical properties are finally
compared with experimental data reported in the literature, revealing an
adequate quantitative agreement.

previous computational studies that As_Ga antisites are candidates for defects
observed in capacitance voltage measurements on metal-oxide-semiconductor
capacitors, as the As_Ga antisite introduces energy states near the valence
band maximum and near the middle of the energy band gap. However, substantial
broadening in the distribution of the Ga_As charge transition levels due to the
variation in the local chemical environment resulting from alloying on the
cation (In/Ga) sublattice is found, whereas this effect is absent for As_Ga
antisites. Also, charge transition energy levels are found to vary based on
proximity to the semiconductor/oxide interface. The combined effects of alloy-
and proximity-shift on the Ga_As antisite charge transition energies are
consistent with the distribution of interface defect levels between the valence
band edge and midgap as extracted from electrical characterization data. Hence,
kinetic growth conditions leading to a high density of either Ga_As or As_Ga
antisites near the In_0.53Ga_0.47As/Al_2O_3 interface are both consistent with
defect energy levels at or below midgap.

simple characterization of PTIME. We believe it is the first time complexity

ranges of particular interest in earthquake engineering. It is demonstrated in
this paper that two seismic cloaks' configurations allow for an unprecedented

cloak design is inspired by some approximation of ideal cloaks' parameters
within the framework of thin plate theory. The second, more accomplished but
more involved, cloak design is deduced from a geometric transform in the full
Navier equations that preserves the symmetry of the elasticity tensor but leads
to Willis' equations, well approximated by a homogenization procedure, as
corroborated by numerical simulations. The two cloaks's designs are strikingly
different, and the superior efficiency of the second type of cloak emphasizes
the necessity for rigor in transposition of existing cloaks's designs in thin
plates to the geophysics setting. Importantly, we focus our attention on
geometric transforms applied to thick plates, which is an intermediate case
between thin plates and semi-infinite media, not studied previously. Cloaking
efficiency (reduction of the disturbance of the wave wavefront and its
amplitude behind an obstacle) and protection (reduction of the wave amplitude
within the center of the cloak) are studied for ideal and approximated cloaks'

motion of the DPC surfactant head groups within the micelles, and two levels of
hydration water shells, including tightly- and loosely-bound hydration water

that the number of waters in hydration shells is approximately constant at 950

decreases after that. At terahertz frequencies, employing the effective-medium
approximation, we estimate that each DPC micelle is surrounded by a
tightly-bound layer of 310 +/- 45 water molecules that behave as if they are an

determine that tightly-bound waters are directly hydrogen-bonded to oxygens of

advances to take place in the networking area. Recent changes imply continuous
demand for bandwidth to manage the large amount of packetized traffic. Cluster
switches and routers make the switching fabric in a Data Center Network (DCN)
environment and provide interconnectivity between elements of the same DC and
inter DCs. To handle the constantly variable loads, switches need deliver
outstanding throughput along with resiliency and scalability for DCN
requirements. Conventional DCN switches adopt crossbars or/and blocks of
memories mounted in a multistage fashion (commonly 2-Tiers or 3-Tiers).
However, current multistage switches, with their space-memory variants, are
either too complex to implement, have poor performance, or not cost effective.
We propose a novel and highly scalable multistage switch based on
Networks-on-Chip (NoC) fabrics for DCNs. In particular, we describe a
three-stage Clos packet-switch with a Round Robin packets dispatching scheme
where each central stage module is based on a Unidirectional NoC (UDN), instead
of the conventional single-hop crossbar. The design, referred to as Clos-UDN,
overcomes shortcomings of traditional multistage architectures as it (i)
Obviates the need for a complex and costly input modules, by means of few, yet
simple, input FIFO queues. (ii) Avoids the need for a complex and synchronized
scheduling process over a high number of input-output modules and/or port
pairs. (iii) Provides speedup, load balancing and path-diversity thanks to a
dynamic dispatching scheme as well as the NoC based fabric nature. Simulations
show that the Clos-UDN outperforms some common multistage switches under a
range of input traffics, making it highly appealing for ultra-high capacity DC
networks.
