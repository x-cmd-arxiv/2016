the properties of our simulated CV populations throughout the entire cluster
evolution. We find that dynamics extends the range of binary CV progenitor
properties, causing CV formation from binary progenitors that would otherwise
not become CVs. The CV formation rate in our simulations can be separated into
two regimes: an initial burst ($\lesssim$ 1 Gyr) connected with the formation
of the most massive white dwarfs, followed by a nearly constant formation rate.
This result holds for all models regardless of the adopted initial conditions,
even when most CVs form dynamically. Given the cluster age-dependence of CV
properties, we argue that direct comparisons to observed Galactic field CVs
could be misleading, since cluster CVs can be up to 4 times older than their
field counterparts. Our results also illustrate that, due mainly to unstable
mass transfer, some CVs that form in our simulations are destroyed before the
present-day. Finally, some field CVs might have originated from globular
clusters, as found in our simulations, although the fraction of such escapers
should be small relative to the entire Galactic field CV population.

(G10.6-0.4), W49N (G43.2-0.1), W51 (G49.5-0.4), and G34.3+0.1. The OPR at
thermal equilibrium ranges from the statistical limit of three at high
temperatures to infinity as the temperature tends toward zero, unlike the case
of H$_{2}$. Depending on the position observed along the lines-of-sight, the
OPR was found to lie either slightly below the high temperature limit of three
(in the range $2.2-2.9$) or above this limit ($\sim3.5$, $\gtrsim 4.2$, and
$\gtrsim 5.0$). In low temperature interstellar gas, where the H$_{2}$ is
para-enriched, our nearly pure gas-phase astrochemical models with nuclear-spin
chemistry can account for anomalously low observed NH$_2$-OPR values. We have
tentatively explained OPR values larger than three by assuming that spin
thermalization of NH$_2$ can proceed at least partially by H-atom exchange
collisions with atomic hydrogen, thus increasing the OPR with decreasing
temperature. In this paper, we present quasi-classical trajectory calculations
of the H-exchange reaction NH$_2$ + H, which show the reaction to proceed
without a barrier, confirming that the H-exchange will be efficient in the
temperature range of interest. With the inclusion of this process, our models
suggest both that OPR values below three arise in regions with temperatures
$\gtrsim20-25$~K, depending on time, and values above three but lower than the

non-backtracking matrix $B$ in the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Model.
  Specifically, we consider a random graph on $n$ vertices partitioned into two
equal-sized clusters. The vertices have i.i.d. weights $\{ \phi_u \}_{u=1}^n$
with second moment $\Phi^{(2)}$. The intra-cluster connection probability for
vertices $u$ and $v$ is $\frac{\phi_u \phi_v}{n}a$ and the inter-cluster
connection probability is $\frac{\phi_u \phi_v}{n}b$.
  We show that with high probability, the following holds: The leading
eigenvalue of the non-backtracking matrix $B$ is asymptotic to $\rho =
\frac{a+b}{2} \Phi^{(2)}$. The second eigenvalue is asymptotic to $\mu_2 =
\frac{a-b}{2} \Phi^{(2)}$ when $\mu_2^2 > \rho$, but asymptotically bounded by
$\sqrt{\rho}$ when $\mu_2^2 \leq \rho$. All the remaining eigenvalues are
asymptotically bounded by $\sqrt{\rho}$. As a result, a clustering
positively-correlated with the true communities can be obtained based on the
second eigenvector of $B$ in the regime where $\mu_2^2 > \rho.$
  In a previous work we obtained that detection is impossible when $\mu_2^2 <
\rho,$ meaning that there occurs a phase-transition in the sparse regime of the
Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Model.
  As a corollary, we obtain that Degree-Corrected Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs
asymptotically satisfy the graph Riemann hypothesis, a quasi-Ramanujan
property.
  A by-product of our proof is a weak law of large numbers for
local-functionals on Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Models, which could be

disk evolution and planet-disk interactions. We follow the recent suggestion
that Herbig Ae/Be disks with a flared disk harbour a cavity, and investigate
the disk around HD~97048.
  Aims: We aim to resolve the 34$\pm$ 4 au central cavity predicted by Maaskant
et al. (2013) and to investigate the structure of the disk.
  Methods: We image the disk around HD~97048 using ALMA at 0.85~mm and 2.94~mm,
and ATCA (multiple frequencies) observations. Our observations also include the
12CO J=1-0, 12CO J=3-2 and HCO+ J=4-3 emission lines.
  Results: A central cavity in the disk around HD~97048 is resolved with a
40-46 au radius. Additional radial structure present in the surface brightness
profile can be accounted for either by an opacity gap at ~90 au or by an extra
emitting ring at ~150 au. The continuum emission tracing the dust in the disk
is detected out to 355 au. The 12CO J=3-2 disk is detected 2.4 times farther
out. The 12CO emission can be traced down to $\approx$ 10 au scales.
Non-Keplerian kinematics are detected inside the cavity via the HCO+ J=4-3
velocity map. The mm spectral index measured from ATCA observations suggests
that grain growth has occurred in the HD~97048 disk. Finally, we resolve a
highly inclined disk out to 150 au around the nearby 0.5~$M_{\odot}$ binary
ISO-ChaI 126.
  Conclusions: The data presented here reveal a cavity in the disk of HD 97048,
and prominent radial structure in the surface brightness. The cavity size
varies for different continuum frequencies and gas tracers. The gas inside the
cavity follows non-Keplerian kinematics seen in HCO+ emission. The variable
cavity size along with the kinematical signature suggests the presence of a
substellar companion or massive planet inside the cavity.

polarization at 10.3 micron from AB Aur's inner disk (r < 80 AU), rising to
~1.4% at larger radii. Our simulations imply that the mid-infrared polarization
of the inner disk arises from dichroic emission of elongated particles aligned
in a disk B-field. The field is well ordered on a spatial scale commensurate
with our resolution (~50 AU), and we infer a poloidal shape tilted from the
rotational axis of the disk. The disk of AB Aur is optically thick at 10.3
micron, so polarimetry at this wavelength is probing the B-field near the disk
surface. Our observations therefore confirm that this layer, favored by some
theoretical studies for developing magneto-rotational instability and its
resultant viscosity, is indeed very likely to be magnetized. At radii beyond
~80 AU, the mid-infrared polarization results primarily from scattering by dust
grains with sizes up to ~1 micron, a size indicating both grain growth and,
probably, turbulent lofting of the particles from the disk mid-plane.

Fanaroff-Riley I and II, which differ in morphology and radio power. Strongly
emitting sources belong to the edge-brightened FR II class, and weakly emitting
sources to the edge-darkened FR I class. The origin of this dichotomy is not
yet fully understood. Numerical simulations are successful in generating FR II
morphologies, but they fail to reproduce the diffuse structure of FR Is.
  By means of hydro-dynamical 3D simulations of supersonic jets, we investigate
how the displayed morphologies depend on the jet parameters. Bow shocks and
Mach disks at the jet head, which are probably responsible for the hot spots in
the FR II sources, disappear for a jet kinetic power L_kin < 10^43 erg/s. This
threshold compares favorably with the luminosity at which the FR I/FR II
transition is observed.
  The problem is addressed by numerical means carrying out 3D HD simulations of
supersonic jets that propagate in a non-homogeneous medium with the ambient
temperature that increases with distance from the jet origin, which maintains
constant pressure.
  The jet energy in the lower power sources, instead of being deposited at the
terminal shock, is gradually dissipated by the turbulence. The jets spread out
while propagating, and they smoothly decelerate while mixing with the ambient
medium and produce the plumes characteristic of FR I objects.
  Three-dimensionality is an essential ingredient to explore the FR I evolution
because the properties of turbulence in two and three dimensions are very
different, since there is no energy cascade to small scales in two dimensions,
and two-dimensional simulations with the same parameters lead to FRII-like
behavior.

  Generalized Linear Mixed Models",,,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inference for spatial generalized linear mixed models (SGLMMs) for
high-dimensional non-Gaussian spatial data is computationally intensive. The
computational challenge is due to the high-dimensional random effects and

computational and confounding issues by replacing the high-dimensional spatial
random effects with a reduced-dimensional representation based on random
projections. Standard MCMC algorithms mix well and the reduced-dimensional

that Bayesian inference for this reduced-dimensional approach works well both

Carlsson and M\'{e}moli to partition-based clustering, and the Isbell/Dress
school's study of injective envelopes. Carlsson and M\'{e}moli introduce the
idea of viewing clustering methods as functors from a category of metric spaces
to a category of clusters, with functoriality subsuming many desirable
properties. Our first series of results extends their theory of functorial
clustering schemes to methods that allow overlapping clusters in the spirit of
Jardine and Sibson. This obviates some of the unpleasant effects of chaining
that occur, for example with single-linkage clustering. We prove an equivalence
between these general overlapping clustering functors and projections of weight
spaces to what we term clustering domains, by focusing on the order structure
determined by the morphisms. As a specific application of this machinery, we
are able to prove that there are no functorial projections to cut metrics, or
even to tree metrics. Finally, although we focus less on the construction of
clustering methods (clustering domains) derived from injective envelopes, we
lay out some preliminary results, that hopefully will give a feel for how the
third leg of the stool comes into play.

We derive a formula for computing the volume for a strip entangling surface and
a general asymptotically AdS bulk geometry. For an AdS black hole geometry, the
volume exhibits non-monotonic behaviour as a function of the size of the
entangling region (unlike the behaviour of the entanglement entropy in this
setup, which is monotonic). For setups in which the holographic entanglement
entropy exhibits transitions in the bulk, such as global AdS black hole,
geometries dual to confining theories and disjoint entangling surfaces, the
corresponding volume exhibits a discontinuous finite jump at the transition
point (and so do the volumes of the corresponding entanglement wedges). We
compute this volume discontinuity in several examples. Lastly, we compute the
codim-zero volume and the bulk action of the entanglement wedge for the case of
a sphere entangling surface and pure AdS geometry.

channel with inter-symbol interference (ISI), in which the channel coefficients
are assumed to be linear time-invariant with finite-length impulse response.
The primary finding of this paper is that, with no channel state information at
a transmitter (CSIT), the sum-spectral efficiency can be made to scale linearly
with $K$, provided that the desired links have longer impulse response than do
the interfering links. This linear gain is achieved by a novel multi-carrier
communication scheme which we call \textit{interference-free orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (IF-OFDM)}. Furthermore, when a transmitter is
able to learn CSIT from its paired receiver only, a higher sum-spectral
efficiency can be achieved by a two-stage transmission method that concatenates
IF-OFDM and vector coding based on singular value decomposition with
water-filling power allocation. A major implication of the derived results is
that separate encoding across subcarriers per link is sufficient to linearly
increase the sum-spectral efficiency with $K$ in the interference channel with
ISI. Simulation results support this claim.

neutral gas occupies only 2 to 8 pc (about 13%) of the space toward the star,
with the remaining volume presumably being filled with a hot gas that emits
soft X-rays. We do not detect any absorption features from the highly ionized
species that could be produced in an interface between the warm medium and the
surrounding hot gas. Finally, the radial velocity of the LIC agrees with that
of the Local Leo Cold Cloud, indicating that they may be physically related.

Second Law of Thermodynamics, address only typical realizations -- as
highlighted by Shannon's asymptotic equipartition property and as entailed by
taking the thermodynamic limit of an infinite number of degrees of freedom.
Indeed, our interpretations of the functioning of macroscopic thermodynamic
cycles are so focused. Using a recently derived Second Law for information
processing, we show that different subsets of fluctuations lead to distinct
thermodynamic functioning in Maxwellian Demons. For example, while typical
realizations may operate as an engine -- converting thermal fluctuations to
useful work -- even ""nearby"" fluctuations (nontypical, but probable
realizations) behave differently, as Landauer erasers -- converting available
stored energy to dissipate stored information. One concludes that ascribing a
single, unique functional modality to a thermodynamic system, especially one on
the nanoscale, is at best misleading, likely masking an array of simultaneous,
parallel thermodynamic transformations. This alters how we conceive of cellular
processes, engineering design, and evolutionary adaptation.

involving hundreds of thousands or even millions of labels. Datasets in extreme
classification exhibit fit to power-law distribution, i.e. a large fraction of
labels have very few positive instances in the data distribution. Most
state-of-the-art approaches for extreme multi-label classification attempt to
capture correlation among labels by embedding the label matrix to a
low-dimensional linear sub-space. However, in the presence of power-law
distributed extremely large and diverse label spaces, structural assumptions
such as low rank can be easily violated.
  In this work, we present DiSMEC, which is a large-scale distributed framework
for learning one-versus-rest linear classifiers coupled with explicit capacity
control to control model size. Unlike most state-of-the-art methods, DiSMEC
does not make any low rank assumptions on the label matrix. Using double layer
of parallelization, DiSMEC can learn classifiers for datasets consisting
hundreds of thousands labels within few hours. The explicit capacity control
mechanism filters out spurious parameters which keep the model compact in size,
without losing prediction accuracy. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation
on publicly available real-world datasets consisting upto 670,000 labels. We
compare DiSMEC with recent state-of-the-art approaches, including - SLEEC which
is a leading approach for learning sparse local embeddings, and FastXML which
is a tree-based approach optimizing ranking based loss function. On some of the
datasets, DiSMEC can significantly boost prediction accuracies - 10% better
compared to SLECC and 15% better compared to FastXML, in absolute terms.

particle in a uniform time-dependent magnetic field described by Newton's
equation can be derived from a coherent Berry phase for the coherent states of
the Schroedinger equation or the Dirac equation. This correspondence is
established by constructing coherent states for a particle using the energy
eigenstates on the Landau levels and proving that the coherent states can
maintain their status of coherent states during the slow varying of the
magnetic field. It is discovered that orbital Berry phases of the eigenstates
interfere coherently to produce an observable effect (which we termed ""coherent
Berry phase""), which is exactly the geometric phase of the classical
gyro-motion. This technique works for particles with and without spin. For
particles with spin, on each of the eigenstates that makes up the coherent
states, the Berry phase consists of two parts that can be identified as those
due to the orbital and the spin motion. It is the orbital Berry phases that
interfere coherently to produce a coherent Berry phase corresponding to the
classical geometric phase of the gyro-motion. The spin Berry phases of the
eigenstates, on the other hand, remain to be quantum phase factors for the
coherent states and have no classical counterpart.

one-variable conjecture of Mazur-Tate-Teitelbaum, who studied the case K=Q and
the phenomenon of exceptional zeros. We discuss old and new theoretical
evidence towards our conjecture and in particular we fully prove it, under mild
conditions, in the following situation: K is imaginary quadratic, A=E_K is the
base-change to K of an elliptic curve over the rationals, and the rank of A is
either 0 or 1.
  The proof is naturally divided into a few cases. Some of them are deduced
from the purely cyclotomic case of elliptic curves over Q, which we obtain from
a refinement of recent work of Venerucci alongside the results of
Greenberg-Stevens, Perrin-Riou, and the author. The only genuinely
multi-variable case (rank 1, two exceptional zeros, three partial derivatives)
is newly established here. Its proof generalises to show that the
`almost-anticyclotomic' case of our conjecture is a consequence of conjectures
of Bertolini-Darmon on families of Heegner points, and of (partly conjectural)
p-adic Gross--Zagier and Waldspurger formulas in families.

a comprehensive understanding of planetary formation and evolution mechanisms
is still desired. One relevant limitation is given by the accuracy in the
measurements of planet-host star ages. The star GJ 504 has been found to host a
substellar companion whose nature is strongly debated. There has been a recent
difference of opinion in the literature owing to the uncertainty on the age of
the system: a young age of $\sim$ 160 Myr would imply a giant planet as a
companion, but a recent revision pointing to a solar age ($\sim$ 4 Gyr) instead
suggests a brown dwarf. With the aim of shedding light on this debated topic,
we have carried out a high-resolution spectroscopic study of GJ 504 to derive
stellar parameters, metallicity, and abundances of both light and heavy
elements, providing a full chemical characterisation. The main objective is to
infer clues on the evolutionary stage (hence the age) of this system. We
performed a strictly differential (line-by-line) analysis of GJ 504 with
respect to two reference stars, that is the planet-host dwarf $\iota$ Hor and
the subgiant HIP 84827. The former is crucial in this context because its
stellar parameters (hence the evolutionary stage) is well constrained from
asteroseismic observations. Regardless of the zero point offsets, our
differential approach allows us to put tight constraints on the age of GJ 504
with respect to $\iota$ Hor, thereby minimising the internal uncertainties. We
found that the surface gravity of GJ 504 is 0.2 $\pm$ 0.07 dex lower than that

play an important role, among the physics goals of LHC experiments. Because of
the nature of proton-proton processes, observables based on the measurement of
the direction and energy of leptons provide the most precise signatures.
  In the present paper, we concentrate on the angular distribution of leptons
from W to l nu decays in the lepton-pair rest-frame. The vector nature of the
intermediate state imposes that distributions are to a good precision described
by spherical polynomials of at most second order. We argue, that contrary to
general belief often expressed in the literature, the full set of angular
coefficients can be measured experimentally, despite the presence in the final
state of neutrino escaping detection. There is thus no principle difference
with respect to the phenomenology of the Z/gamma to l^+ l^- Drell-Yan process.
  We show also, that with the proper choice of the coordinate frames, only one
coefficient in this polynomial decomposition remains sizable, even in the
presence of one or more high p_T jets. The necessary stochastic choice of the
frames relies on probabilities independent from any coupling constants. In this
way, electroweak effects (dominated by the V-A nature of W couplings to
fermions) can be better separated from the ones of strong interactions. The
separation is convenient for the measurements interpretation.

In the context of the twisted fourth moment, Watt's result is an optimal
replacement for Selberg's eigenvalue conjecture.
  Our work extends the previous result of Hughes and Young, where Dirichlet
polynomials of length $T^{\frac{1}{11}-\varepsilon}$ were considered. Our
result has several applications, among others to the proportion of critical
zeros of the Riemann zeta-function, zero spacing and lower bounds for moments.

averaging on the variables $m_1, m_2, n_1, n_2, h$ and arbitrary weights in the

chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) targeting an approximate marginal of the target
distribution. In the context of Bayesian latent variable models, the MCMC
typically operates on the hyperparameters, and the subsequent weighting may be
based on IS or sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), but allows for multilevel
techniques as well. The IS approach provides a natural alternative to delayed
acceptance (DA) pseudo-marginal/particle MCMC, and has many advantages over DA,
including a straightforward parallelisation and additional flexibility in MCMC
implementation. We detail minimal conditions which ensure strong consistency of
the suggested estimators, and provide central limit theorems with expressions
for asymptotic variances. We demonstrate how our method can make use of SMC in
the state space models context, using Laplace approximations and
time-discretised diffusions. Our experimental results are promising and show
that the IS type approach can provide substantial gains relative to an
analogous DA scheme, and is often competitive even without parallelisation.

advantages of using quantum computing technologies as sampling engines to speed
up these tasks or to make them more effective. However, some pressing
challenges in state-of-the-art quantum annealers have to be overcome before we
can assess their actual performance. The sparse connectivity, resulting from
the local interaction between quantum bits in physical hardware
implementations, is considered the most severe limitation to the quality of
constructing powerful generative unsupervised machine-learning models. Here we
use embedding techniques to add redundancy to data sets, allowing us to
increase the modeling capacity of quantum annealers. We illustrate our findings
by training hardware-embedded graphical models on a binarized data set of
handwritten digits and two synthetic data sets in experiments with up to 940
quantum bits. Our model can be trained in quantum hardware without full
knowledge of the effective parameters specifying the corresponding quantum
Gibbs-like distribution; therefore, this approach avoids the need to infer the
effective temperature at each iteration, speeding up learning; it also
mitigates the effect of noise in the control parameters, making it robust to
deviations from the reference Gibbs distribution. Our approach demonstrates the
feasibility of using quantum annealers for implementing generative models, and
it provides a suitable framework for benchmarking these quantum technologies on
machine-learning-related tasks.

topological complexity of the surface in graph-theoretic terms; indeed we show
that its value is $6g-6+2p$, i.e. twice the size of a maximal multicurve on the

consists in solving the cosmological perturbation equations in complete
generality for a hydrodynamical fluid. We then describe the evolution of the
fluctuations over the different length scales of interest and as a function of
the equation of state for the fluid, and we explore two different types of
initial conditions: quantum vacuum and thermal fluctuations. We also derive a
general requirement for black hole collapse on sub-Hubble scales, and we use
the Press-Schechter formalism to describe the black hole formation probability.
For a fluid with a small sound speed (e.g., dust), we find that both quantum
and thermal initial fluctuations grow in a contracting universe, and the
largest inhomogeneities that first collapse into black holes are of Hubble size
and the collapse occurs well before reaching the Planck scale. For a
radiation-dominated fluid, we find that no black hole can form before reaching
the Planck scale. In the context of matter bounce cosmology, it thus appears
that only models in which a radiation-dominated era begins early in the
cosmological evolution are robust against the formation of black holes. Yet,
the formation of black holes might be an interesting feature for other models.
We comment on a number of possible alternative early universe scenarios that
could take advantage of this feature.

objects in which to directly image forming planets. The high contrast imaging
technique of non-redundant masking is well posed to detect planetary mass
companions at several to tens of AU in nearby transition disks. We present
non-redundant masking observations of the T Cha and LkCa 15 transition disks,
both of which host posited sub-stellar mass companions. However, due to a loss
of information intrinsic to the technique, observations of extended sources
(e.g. scattered light from disks) can be misinterpreted as moving companions.
We discuss tests to distinguish between these two scenarios, with applications
to the T Cha and LkCa 15 observations. We argue that a static,
forward-scattering disk can explain the T Cha data, while LkCa 15 is best
explained by multiple orbiting companions.

this transition, the shell of swept up material fragments due to
Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, but these clumps contain little mass and are
likely to be rapidly ablated by the hot gas in which they are immersed. We then
explore an alternative scenario in which clumps form from thermal instabilities
at R >~ 1 kpc, possibly containing enough dust to catalyze molecule formation.
We investigate this processes with 3D two-fluid (gas+dust) numerical
simulations of a kpc^3 patch of the outflow, including atomic and dust cooling,
thermal conduction, dust sputtering, and photoionization from the QSO radiation
field. In all cases, dust grains are rapidly destroyed in ~10,000 years; and
while some cold clumps form at later times, they are present only as transient
features, which disappear as cooling becomes more widespread. In fact, we only
find a stable two-phase medium with dense clumps if we artificially enhance the
QSO radiation field by a factor 100. This result, together with the complete
destruction of dust grains, renders the interpretation of molecular outflows a
very challenging problem.

deformations of the Hamiltonian is known as quantum adiabatic, or Thouless,
pumping. Central to this phenomenon are Hamiltonians whose insulating gap is
controlled by a multi-dimensional (usually two-dimensional) parameter space in
which paths can be defined for adiabatic changes in the Hamiltonian, i.e.,
without closing the gap. Here, we extend the concept of Thouless pumps of band
insulators by considering a larger, three-dimensional parameter space. We show
that the connectivity of this parameter space is crucial for defining quantum
pumps, demonstrating that, as opposed to the conventional two-dimensional case,
pumped quantities depend not only on the initial and final points of
Hamiltonian evolution but also on the class of the chosen path and preserved
symmetries. As such, we distinguish the scenarios of closed/open paths of
Hamiltonian evolution, finding that different closed cycles can lead to the
pumping of different quantum numbers, and that different open paths may point
to distinct scenarios for surface physics. As explicit examples, we consider
models similar to simple models used to describe topological insulators, but
with doubled degrees of freedom compared to a minimal topological insulator
model. The extra fermionic flavors from doubling allow for extra gapping
terms/adiabatic parameters - besides the usual topological mass which preserves
the topology-protecting discrete symmetries - generating an enlarged adiabatic
parameter-space. We consider cases in one and three \emph{spatial} dimensions,

it is necessary to have a broad dispersion, corresponding to Mach numbers >~ 30

extract real-frequency spectra remains a key problem in connecting theory with

(FESOM) as a more accessible variant of the stochastic optimization method
introduced by Mishchenko et al. and benchmark the resulting spectra with those
obtained by the standard Maximum Entropy method for three representative test
cases, in- cluding data taken from studies of the two-dimensional Hubbard
model. We generally find that our FESOM approach gives spectra similar to the
Maximum Entropy results. In particular, while the Maximum Entropy method gives
superior results when the quality of the data is strong, we find that FESOM is
able to resolve fine structure with more detail when the quality of the data is
poor. In addition, because of its stochastic nature, the method provides
detailed information on the frequency dependent uncertainty of the resulting
spectra, while the Maximum Entropy method does so only for the spectral weight
integrated over a finite frequency region. We therefore believe that this
variant of the stochastic optimization approach provides a viable alternative
to the routinely used Maximum Entropy method especially for data with poor
quality.

resulting SED fits, which have only extinction as a free parameter, provide a
virtually model-independent measure of the bolometric flux at Earth. The SED
fits are satisfactory for 156 of the EBs, for which we achieve typical
precisions in the bolometric flux of $\approx$ 3%. Combined with the accurately
known bolometric luminosity, the result for each EB is a predicted parallax
that is typically precise to $\lesssim$ 5%. These predicted parallaxes---with
typical uncertainties of 200 $\mu$as---are 4-5 times more precise than those
determined by Hipparcos for 99 of the EBs in our sample, with which we find
excellent agreement. There is no evidence among this sample for significant
systematics in the Hipparcos parallaxes of the sort that notoriously afflicted

more than 10 mag in brightness, reach distances of more than 5 kpc, and in many

mathematics. Many interesting problems in mathematics can be formulated,
computed, or can find their equivalence in terms of Ext-groups. For instance,
important (co)homology theories, such as the Mac Lane cohomology for rings or
the Hochschild and cyclic homology of commutative algebras can be defined as
Ext-groups in suitable functor categories; homotopical invariants can also gain
information from homological data with the help of the unstable Adams spectral
sequence, whose input takes the form of Ext-groups in the category of unstable
modules over the Steenrod algebra. Therefore, the constructions of explicit
injective (projective) resolutions in an abelian category is of great
importance. In this article, we introduce a new method, called
Pseudo-hyperresolution, to study such constructions. This method originates in
the category of unstable modules, and aims at building explicit resolutions for
the reduced singular cohomology of spheres. In particular, for all integers
$n\geq 0$, we can describe a large range of the minimal injective resolution of
the sphere $S^{n}$ based on the Bockstein operation of the Steenrod algebra.
Moreover, many classical constructions in algebraic topology, such as the
algebraic EHP sequence or the Lambda algebra can be recovered using the
Pseudo-hyperresolution method. A particular connection between spheres and the
infinite complex projective space is also established. Despite its origin,
Pseudo-hyperresolution generalizes to all abelian categories. In particular,
many explicit resolutions of classical strict polynomial functors can be
reunified in view of Pseudo-hyperresolution. As a consequence, we recover the
global dimension of the category of homogeneous strict polynomial functors of
finite degree as well as the Mac Lane cohomology of finite fields.

a spin-spin interaction between quasi-free carriers and magnetic impurities,
but also to a local spin-independent disorder potential for the carriers. Based
on a quantum kinetic theory for the carrier and impurity density matrices as
well as the magnetic and non-magnetic carrier-impurity correlations, the
influence of the non-magnetic scattering potential on the spin dynamics in DMS
after optical excitation with circularly polarized light is investigated using
the example of Mn-doped CdTe. It is shown that non-Markovian effects, which are
predicted in calculations where only the magnetic carrier-impurity interaction
is accounted for, can be strongly suppressed in the presence of non-magnetic
impurity scattering. This effect can be traced back to a significant
redistribution of carriers in $\mathbf{k}$-space which is enabled by the
build-up of large carrier-impurity correlation energies. A comparison with the
Markov limit of the quantum kinetic theory shows that, in the presence of an
external magnetic field parallel to the initial carrier polarization, the
asymptotic value of the spin polarization at long times is significantly
different in the quantum kinetic and the Markovian calculations. This effect
can also be attributed to the formation of strong correlations which
invalidates the semiclassical Markovian picture and it is stronger when the
non-magnetic carrier-impurity interaction is accounted for. In an external
magnetic field perpendicular to the initial carrier spin, the correlations are
also responsible for a renormalization of the carrier spin precession
frequency.

(KB). The most essential benefit of such logical KBs is the opportunity to
perform automatic reasoning which however requires a KB to meet some minimal
quality criteria such as consistency. Without adequate tool assistance, the
task of resolving such violated quality criteria in a KB can be extremely hard,
especially when the problematic KB is large and complex. To this end,
interactive KB debuggers have been introduced which ask a user queries whether
certain statements must or must not hold in the intended domain. The given
answers help to gradually restrict the search space for KB repairs.
  Existing interactive debuggers often rely on a pool-based strategy for query
computation. A pool of query candidates is precomputed, from which the best
candidate according to some query quality criterion is selected to be shown to
the user. This often leads to the generation of many unnecessary query
candidates and thus to a high number of expensive calls to logical reasoning
services. We tackle this issue by an in-depth mathematical analysis of diverse
real-valued active learning query selection measures in order to determine
qualitative criteria that make a query favorable. These criteria are the key to
devising efficient heuristic query search methods. The proposed methods enable
for the first time a completely reasoner-free query generation for interactive
KB debugging while at the same time guaranteeing optimality conditions, e.g.
minimal cardinality or best understandability for the user, of the generated
query that existing methods cannot realize.
  Further, we study different relations between active learning measures. The
obtained picture gives a hint about which measures are more favorable in which
situation or which measures always lead to the same outcomes, based on given

itself. Ballistic transport is typically seen in high purity crystals at either
temperatures below ~10 K, or physical size below ~100 nm, where the mean free
path of the carrier is larger than the solid itself. In this letter, we show
evidence of ballistic transport at room temperature in lithium niobate wafers
in the in-plane and cross-plane directions under both steady state and high
frequency heating that are monitored using both infrared and resistance
thermometry. We report phonon mean free path in lithium niobate around 425
microns, which is about 50 times higher than the largest phonon mean free path
in the literature at room temperature. Above this length-scale, temperature
gradient gradually emerges and the material shows completely diffusive, bulk
transport at about 4 mm length. Our observations will impact phonon-based
electronics such as thermal transistor, thermal logic gate and memory currently
impossible at room temperature. If 1 micron electron mean free path in graphene
gives the highest-mobility, the 425 microns mean free path of phonons in this

for what we are likely to observe in our domain, is crucial to establishing the
validity of these theories. One way to extract such predictions is from
theory-generated probability distributions that allow for selection
effects---generally expressed in terms of assumptions about anthropic
conditionalization and how typical we are. In this paper, I urge three lessons
about typicality in multiverse settings. (i) Because it is difficult to
characterize our observational situation in the multiverse, we cannot assume
that we are typical (as in the 'principle of mediocrity'): nor can we ignore
the issue of typicality, for it has a measurable impact on predictions for our
observations. (ii) There are spectra of assumptions about both
conditionalization and typicality, which lead to coincident predictions for our
observations, leading to problems of confirmation in multiverse cosmology. And
moreover, (iii) when one has the freedom to consider competing theories of the
multiverse, the assumption of typicality may not lead to the highest
likelihoods for our observations. These three entwined aspects of typicality
imply that positive assertions about our typicality, such as the 'principle of
mediocrity', are more questionable than has been recently claimed.

investigate the fate of the critical point in a regime, where the weak coupling

that has been inferred from observations of intermediate to upper mass T Tauri
stars---that is $\dot{M} \propto M_*^{1.3 \pm 0.3}$. We explain this
correlation within the framework of quiescent disk evolution, in which
accretion is driven largely by gravitational torques acting in the bulk of the
mass and volume of the disk. Stresses within the disk arise from the action of
gravitationally driven torques parameterized in our 1D model in terms of
Toomre's $Q$ criterion. We do not model the hot inner sub-AU scale region of
the disk that is likely stable according to this criterion, and appeal to other
mechanisms to remove or redistribute angular momentum and allow accretion onto
the star. Our model has the advantage of agreeing with large-scale
angle-averaged values from more complex nonaxisymmetric calculations. The model
disk transitions from an early phase (dominated by initial conditions inherited
from the burst mode of accretion) into a later self-similar mode characterized
by a steeper temporal decline in $\dot{M}$. The models effectively reproduce
the spread in mass accretion rates that have been observed for protostellar
objects of $0.2\,\mbox{M}_\odot \le M_* \le 3.0\,\mbox{M}_\odot$, such as those
found in the $\rho$ Ophiuchus and Taurus star forming regions. We then compare
realistically sampled populations of young stellar objects produced by our
model to their observational counterparts. We find these populations to be
statistically coincident, which we argue is evidence for the role of
gravitational torques in the late time evolution of quiescent protostellar

given out in a specific zone and each of them had an ability of collecting
information from the environment and sending collected data to the sink. The
most significant issues in wireless sensor networks despite the recent progress
is the trouble of the severe limitations of energy resources. Since that in
different applications of sensor nets we could throw a static or mobile sink
then all aspects of such networks should be planned with an awareness of
energy. One of the most significant topics related to these networks is
routing. One of the most widely used and efficient methods of routing is a
hierarchy (based on clustering) method. In The present study with the objective
of cutting down energy consumption and persistence of network coverage we have
offered a novel algorithm based on clustering algorithms and multi hop routing.
To achieve this goal first we layer the network environment based on the size
of the network. We will identify the optimal number of cluster heads and every
cluster head based on the mechanism of topology control will start to accept
members. Likewise we set the first layer as gate layer and subsequently
identifying the gate nodes we would turn away half of the sensors and then stop
using energy and the remaining nodes in this layer will join the gate nodes
because they hold a critical part in bettering the functioning of the system.
Cluster heads off following layers send the information to cluster heads in the
above layer until sent data will be sent to gate nodes and finally will be sent
to sink. We have tested the proposed algorithm in two situations 1) when the
sink is off and 2) when a sink is on and simulation data shows that proposed
algorithm has better performance in terms of the life span of a network than
LEACH and E LEACH protocols.

sample of 18 jets and 2 HH objects. All of the jets we targeted with WFC3 show
bright infrared [Fe II] emission, and a few H$\alpha$ candidate jets are
confirmed as collimated outflows based on the morphology of their [Fe II]
emission. Continuum-subtracted images clearly separate jet emission from the
adjacent ionization front, providing a better tracer of the collimated jet than
H$\alpha$ and allowing us to connect these jets with their embedded driving
sources. The [Fe II] 1.64 $\mu$m/H$\alpha$ flux ratio measured in the jets is
$\gtrsim 5$ times larger than in the adjacent ionization fronts. The
low-ionization jet core requires high densities to shield Fe$^+$ against
further ionization by the FUV radiation from O-type stars in the H II region.
High jet densities imply high mass-loss rates, consistent with the
intermediate-mass driving sources we identify for 13 jets. The remaining jets
emerge from opaque globules that obscure emission from the protostar. In many
respects, the HH jets in Carina look like a scaled-up version of the jets
driven by low-mass protostars. Altogether, these observations suggest that [Fe
II] emission is a reliable tracer of dense, irradiated jets driven by
intermediate-mass protostars. We argue that highly collimated outflows are
common to more massive protostars, and that they suggest the outflow physics
inferred for low-mass stars formation scales up to at least $\sim8$
M$_{\odot}$.

differential equations and preconditioners for the algebraic systems resulting
from the discretizations. For problems with high contrast and multiple scales,
the standard mortar spaces are not robust, and some enrichments are necessary
in order to obtain an efficient and robust mortar space. In this paper, we
consider a class of flow problems in high contrast heterogeneous media, and
develop a systematic approach to obtain an enriched multiscale mortar space.
Our approach is based on the constructions of local multiscale basis functions.
The multiscale basis functions are constructed from local problems by following
the framework of the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM). In
particular, we first create a local snapshot space. Then we select the
dominated modes within the snapshot space using an appropriate Proper
Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) technique. These multiscale basis functions show
better accuracy than polynomial basis for multiscale problems. Using the
proposed multiscale mortar space, we will construct a multiscale finite element
method to solve the flow problem on a coarse grid and a preconditioning
technique for the fine scale discretization of the flow problem. In particular,
we develop a multiscale mortar mixed finite element method using the mortar
space. In addition, we will design a two-level additive preconditioner and a
two-level hybrid preconditioner based on the proposed mortar space for the
iterative method applied to the fine scale discretization of the flow problem.
We present several numerical examples to demonstrate the efficiency and
robustness of our proposed mortar space with respect to both the coarse
multiscale solver and the preconditioners.

parameters which control the learners. In software analytics, at least for
defect prediction, several methods, like grid search and differential evolution
(DE), have been proposed to learn these parameters, which has been proved to be
able to improve the performance scores of learners.
  Objective: We want to evaluate which method can find better parameters in
terms of performance score and runtime cost.
  Methods: This paper compares grid search to differential evolution, which is
an evolutionary algorithm that makes extensive use of stochastic jumps around
the search space.
  Results: We find that the seemingly complete approach of grid search does no
better, and sometimes worse, than the stochastic search. When repeated 20 times
to check for conclusion validity, DE was over 210 times faster than grid search
to tune Random Forests on 17 testing data sets with F-Measure
  Conclusions: These results are puzzling: why does a quick partial search be
just as effective as a much slower, and much more, extensive search? To answer
that question, we turned to the theoretical optimization literature. Bergstra
and Bengio conjecture that grid search is not more effective than more
randomized searchers if the underlying search space is inherently low
dimensional. This is significant since recent results show that defect
prediction exhibits very low intrinsic dimensionality-- an observation that
explains why a fast method like DE may work as well as a seemingly more
thorough grid search. This suggests, as a future research direction, that it
might be possible to peek at data sets before doing any optimization in order
to match the optimization algorithm to the problem at hand.

taints the results, so we focus on the 171 Angstrom waveband , which has the
highest signal-to-noise ratio. The lags between pairs of wavebands distinguish
between coronal versus transition region (TR) emission. In all physical regions
studied, scaling in the range 15-45 min is multifractal, and the time series

time series is greater than for coronal emission. The multifractality stems
from long term correlations in the data rather than the wide distribution of
intensities. Observations in the 335 Angstrom waveband can be described in
terms of a multifractal with added noise. The multiscaling of the EUV data
agrees qualitatively with the radiance from a phenomenological model of
impulsive bursts plus noise, and also from ohmic dissipation in a reduced
magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) model for coronal loop heating. The parameter space

obtained by the NAFF method strongly depends on the critical frequency drift

strongly depends on the frequency difference parameter $L_{\rm r}$ and the

(SAMI) Galaxy Survey and the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey to
investigate the spatially-resolved signatures of the environmental quenching of
star formation in galaxies. Using dust-corrected measurements of the
distribution of H$\alpha$ emission we measure the radial profiles of star
formation in a sample of 201 star-forming galaxies covering three orders of
magnitude in stellar mass (M$_{*}$; $10^{8.1}$-$10^{10.95}\, $M$_{\odot}$) and
in $5^{th}$ nearest neighbour local environment density ($\Sigma_{5}$;
$10^{-1.3}$-$10^{2.1}\,$Mpc$^{-2}$). We show that star formation rate gradients
in galaxies are steeper in dense ($\log_{10}(\Sigma_{5}/$Mpc$^{2})>0.5$)
environments by $0.58\pm 0.29\, dex\, $r$_{e}^{-1}$ in galaxies with stellar
masses in the range $10^{10}<$M$_{*}/$M$_{\odot}<10^{11}$ and that this
steepening is accompanied by a reduction in the integrated star formation rate.
However, for any given stellar mass or environment density the star-formation
morphology of galaxies shows large scatter. We also measure the degree to which
the star formation is centrally concentrated using the unitless scale-radius
ratio ($r_{50,H\alpha}/r_{50,cont}$), which compares the extent of ongoing star
formation to previous star formation. With this metric we find that the
fraction of galaxies with centrally concentrated star formation increases with
environment density, from $\sim 5\pm 4\%$ in low-density environments
($\log_{10}(\Sigma_{5}/$Mpc$^{2})<0.0$) to $30\pm 15\%$ in the highest density
environments ($\log_{10}(\Sigma_{5}/$Mpc$^{2})>1.0$). These lines of evidence
strongly suggest that with increasing local environment density the star
formation in galaxies is suppressed, and that this starts in their outskirts
such that quenching occurs in an outside-in fashion in dense environments and
is not instantaneous.

analyze the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network. The indispensable nodes,
which their removal increase the number of driver nodes to control the network,
are found essential in PPI network. However, the PPI network is far from
complete and there may exist many false-positive or false-negative
interactions, which promotes us to question: are these indispensable nodes
robust to structural change? Here we systematically investigate the robustness
of indispensable nodes of PPI network by removing and adding possible
interactions. We found that the indispensable nodes are sensitive to the
structural change and very few edges can change the type of many indispensable
nodes. The finding may promote our understanding to the control principle of
PPI network.

progress has been made both in theory and applications, most of the algorithms
only work for static scenes and rigid objects. In recent years, structure and
motion recovery of non-rigid objects and dynamic scenes have received a lot of
attention. In this paper, the state-of-the-art techniques for structure and
motion factorization of non-rigid objects are reviewed and discussed. First, an
introduction of the structure from motion problem is presented, followed by a
general formulation of non-rigid structure from motion. Second, an augmented
affined factorization framework, by using homogeneous representation, is
presented to solve the registration issue in the presence of outlying and
missing data. Third, based on the observation that the reprojection residuals
of outliers are significantly larger than those of inliers, a robust
factorization strategy with outlier rejection is proposed by means of the
reprojection residuals, followed by some comparative experimental evaluations.
Finally, some future research topics in non-rigid structure from motion are
discussed.

discovery problem finds groups of nodes that share similar graph topological

prevent its use in some domains. Firstly, it is completely unsupervised which
is undesirable for a number of reasons. Secondly, most work is limited to a
single relational graph. We address both these lim- itations in an intuitive

convex constraints to be placed on the role discovery problem which can provide

shape at high frequencies due to the secondary relaxation. The relaxation time
of $\alpha$-process, $\tau_{\alpha}$ follows Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation.
The glass transition temperature, $T_{g}$=296K and fragility index, m=50 are

near T$_{g}$ the dielectric loss has Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts stretch

(mmWave) wireless systems with large antenna arrays. By exploiting the inherent
sparse nature of the mmWave channel, we develop a novel rate-adaptive channel
estimation (RACE) algorithm, which can adaptively adjust the number of required
channel measurements based on an expected probability of estimation error
(PEE). To this end, we design a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator to optimally
extract the path information and the associated probability of error from the
increasing number of channel measurements. Based on the ML estimator, the
algorithm is able to measure the channel using a variable number of beam
patterns until the receiver believes that the estimated direction is correct.
This is in contrast to the existing mmWave channel estimation algorithms, in
which the number of measurements is typically fixed. Simulation results show
that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the number of channel
estimation measurements while still retaining a high level of accuracy,
compared to existing multi-stage channel estimation algorithms.

of time periodic parameters is studied, where the numerical results are
complemented by analytic expressions for the renormalization in the limit of

power laws. We utilize the tunability of the effective reservoir distribution
function in a periodically driven onsite energy setup to show how its shape is
directly reflected in the renormalization group flow. This allows to flexibly
tune the power-law renormalization generically encountered in quantum dot
structures. Finally, an in-phase quantum pump as well as a single parameter
pump are investigated in the whole regime of driving frequency, demonstrating
that the new power law in the driving frequency is reflected in the mean

the motions of the observer, the lens galaxy (including the motion of the stars
within the galaxy), and the source; hence, its frequency is directly related to
the galaxy's transverse peculiar velocity. The idea is to count time-event
rates (e.g., peak or caustic crossing rates) in the observed microlensing light
curves of lensed quasars that can be compared with model predictions for
different values of the transverse peculiar velocity. To compensate for the
large time-scale of microlensing variability we propose to count and model the
number of events in an ensemble of gravitational lenses. We develop the
methodology to achieve this goal and apply it to an ensemble of 17 lensed
quasar systems. In spite of the shortcomings of the available data, we have
obtained tentative estimates of the peculiar velocity dispersion of lens
galaxies at $z\sim 0.5$, $\sigma_{\rm
pec}(0.53\pm0.18)\simeq(638\pm213)\sqrt{\langle m \rangle/0.3 M_\odot} \, \rm

s^{-1}$, consistent with peculiar motions of nearby galaxies and with recent
$N$-body nonlinear reconstructions of the Local Universe based on $\Lambda$CDM.
We analyze the different sources of uncertainty of the method and find that for
the present ensemble of 17 lensed systems the error is dominated by Poissonian
noise, but that for larger ensembles the impact of the uncertainty on the

by asking the amount of change that happens to the clusters of players over a
sequence of game rounds. In this study we present a method for measuring
changes in clusters with the same items over discrete time points using
external clustering validation indices and area under the curve. External
clustering indices were originally used to measure the difference between
suggested clusters in terms of clustering algorithms and ground truth labels
for items provided by experts. Instead of different cluster label comparison,
we use these indices to compare between clusters of any two consecutive time
points or between the first time point and the remaining time points to measure
the difference between clusters through time points. In theory, any external
clustering indices can be used to measure changes for any traditional
(non-temporal) clustering algorithm, due to the fact that any time point alone
is not carrying any temporal information. For the public goods game, our
results indicate that the players are changing over time but the change is
smooth and relatively constant between any two time points.

attention in the last few years as they are a helpful technique to approach
common a data structure in clinical studies where longitudinal outcomes are
recorded alongside event times. Those two processes are often linked and the
two outcomes should thus be modeled jointly in order to prevent the potential
bias introduced by independent modelling. Commonly, joint models are estimated
in likelihood based expectation maximization or Bayesian approaches using
frameworks where variable selection is problematic and which do not immediately
work for high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a boosting algorithm
tackling these challenges by being able to simultaneously estimate predictors
for joint models and automatically select the most influential variables even
in high-dimensional data situations. We analyse the performance of the new
algorithm in a simulation study and apply it to the Danish cystic fibrosis

fibrosis together with data regarding the onset of pulmonary infections. This
is the first approach to combine state-of-the art algorithms from the field of

that QPPs are an inherent feature of solar flares, because almost all flares
exhibit QPPs. Moreover, it is now firmly established that QPPs often show
multiple periods. We also review possible mechanisms for generating QPPs. Up to
now, it has not been possible to conclusively identify the triggering mechanism

seismological inferences of flare plasma parameters. QPPs in stellar flares

CB15 and spin-coated onto a substrate treated for planar alignment of the
director, resulting in a film of thickness several hundred nm in the smectic-A
phase. In both doped and undoped samples, the competing boundary conditions -
planar alignment at the substrate and vertical alignment at the free surface -
cause the liquid crystal to break into a series of flattened hemicylinders to
satisfy the boundary conditions. When viewed under an optical microscope with
crossed polarizers, this structure results in a series of dark and light
stripes (""oily streaks"") of period ~ 1 $\mu$m. In the absence of chiral dopant
the stripes run perpendicular to the substrate's easy axis. However, when doped
with chiral CB15 at concentrations up to c = 4 wt-%, the stripe orientation
rotates by a temperature-dependent angle $\phi$ with respect to the c = 0
stripe orientation, where $\phi$ increases monotonically with c. $\phi$ is
largest just below the nematic -- smectic-A transition temperature TNA and
decreases with decreasing temperature. As the temperature is lowered, $\phi$
relaxes to a steady-state orientation close to zero within ~1$^\circ$ C of TNA.
We suggest that the rotation phenomenon is a manifestation of the surface
electroclinic effect: The rotation is due to the weak smectic order parameter
and resulting large director tilt susceptibility with respect to the smectic
layer normal near TNA, in conjunction with an effective surface electric field
due to polar interactions between the liquid crystal and substrate.

We utilise a simple model in two dimensions comprised of a plane layer that is
rotating about an axis inclined to gravity. It is known that this setup can
result in strong mean flows; we numerically examine the effect of an imposed
horizontal magnetic field on such flows. We show that increasing the field
strength in general suppresses the time-dependent mean flows, but in some cases
it organises them leading to stronger time-averaged flows. Further, we discuss
the effect of the field on the correlations responsible for driving the flows
and the competition between Reynolds and Maxwell stresses. A change in
behaviour is observed when the (fluid and magnetic) Prandtl numbers are
decreased. In the smaller Prandtl number regime, it is shown that significant
mean flows can persist even when the quenching of the overall flow velocity by
the field is relatively strong.

measurement and time to event data is to combine a linear Gaussian random
effects model for the repeated measurements with a log-Gaussian frailty model
for the time-to-event outcome, linking the two through some form of correlation
structure between the random effects and the log-frailty. In this approach,
covariates are assumed to affect the mean response profile of the repeated
measurement data. Objectives: Some applications raise substantive questions
that cannot be captured by this structure. For example, an important question
in cystic fibrosis (CF) research is to understand the impact of a patient's
lung function trajectory on their risk of acquiring a variety of infections,
and how this varies at different quantiles of the lung function distribution.
Methods: Motivated by this question, we develop a joint quantile modelling
framework in this paper with an associated Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm
for Bayesian inference. Results: The translation from the common joint model
towards quantile regression succeeds and is applied to CF data from the United
Kingdom. The method helps detecting an overall difference in the relation
between lung function decline and onset of infection in the different
quantiles. Conclusions: Joint modelling without taking into account the special
heteroscedastic structure is not sufficient in certain research question and
the extensions towards models beyond the mean is necessary.

symmetries of a Minkowski spacetime quantum field theory cannot combine
nontrivially in an extended symmetry group. We establish an analogous result
for quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, assuming local covariance, the
timeslice property, a local dynamical form of Lorentz invariance, and
additivity. Unlike the CM theorem, our result is valid in dimensions $n\ge 2$
and for free or interacting theories. It is formulated for theories defined on
a category of all globally hyperbolic spacetimes equipped with a global
coframe, on which the restricted Lorentz group acts, and makes use of a general
analysis of symmetries induced by the action of a group $G$ on the category of
spacetimes. Such symmetries are shown to be canonically associated with a
cohomology class in the second degree nonabelian cohomology of $G$ with
coefficients in the global gauge group of the theory. Our main result proves
that the cohomology class is trivial if $G$ is the universal cover $\cal S$ of
the restricted Lorentz group. Among other consequences, it follows that the
extended symmetry group is a direct product of the global gauge group and $\cal
S$, all fields transform in multiplets of $\cal S$, fields of different spin do
not mix under the extended group, and the occurrence of noninteger spin is
controlled by the centre of the global gauge group. The general analysis is
also applied to rigid scale covariance.

This process
is important for both theory and observations. Using results of a survey for a
wide parameter range with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we
constructed an empirical formula for the gap structure (i.e., the radial
surface density distribution), which can reproduce the gap width and depth
obtained by two-dimensional simulations. This formula enables us to judge
whether an observed gap is likely to be caused by an embedded planet or not.
The propagation of waves launched by the planet is closely connected to the gap
structure. It makes the gap wider and shallower as compared with the case where
an instantaneous wave damping is assumed. The hydrodynamic simulations shows
that the waves do not decay immediately at the launching point of waves, even
when the planet is as massive as Jupiter. Based on the results of hydrodynamic
simulations, we also obtained an empirical model of wave propagation and
damping for the cases of deep gaps. The one-dimensional gap model with our wave
propagation model is able to well reproduce the gap structures in hydrodynamic
simulations. In the case of a Jupiter-mass planet, we also found that the waves
with smaller wavenumber (e.g., $m=2$) are excited and transport the angular
momentum to the location far away from the planet. The wave with $m=2$ is
closely related with a secondary wave launched by the site opposite from the
planet.

First tackled by the Greek astronomers from a geometric point of view, an
estimate, although incorrect, has been determined, not truly called into
question for several centuries. The French school of astronomy, under the
impetus of Mouton and Picard in the XVIIth century can be considered as a
pioneer in this issue. It was followed by the German school at the end of the
XIXth century whose works led to a canonical value established at 959"".63
(second of arc). A number of ground-based observations has been made in the
second half of the XIXth century leading to controversial results mainly due to
the difficulty to disentangle between the solar and atmospheric effects.
Dedicated space measurements yield to a very faint dependence of the solar
diameter with time. New studies over the entire radiation spectrum lead to a
clear relationship between the solar diameter and the wavelength, reflecting
the height at which the lines are formed. Thus the absolute value of the solar
diameter, which is a reference for many astrophysical applications, must be
stated according to the wavelength. Furthermore, notable features of the Near
Sub-Surface Layer (NSSL), called the leptocline, can be established in relation
to the solar limb variations, mainly through the shape asphericities
coefficients. The exact relationship has not been established yet, but recent
studies encourage further in-depth investigations of the solar subsurface

Intriguingly a series of flares exhibiting X-shaped ribbons occurred at the
similar location on the outskirts of NOAA AR 11967, where magnetic fluxes were
scattered, yet three of them were alarmingly energetic. The X shape, whose
center coincided with hard X-ray emission, was similar in UV/EUV, which cannot
be accommodated in the standard flare model. Mapping out magnetic
connectivities in potential fields, we found that the X morphology was dictated
by the intersection of two quasi-separatrix layers, i.e., a hyperbolic flux
tube (HFT), within which a separator connecting a double null was embedded.
This topology was not purely local but regulated by fluxes and flows over the
whole AR. The nonlinear force-free field model suggested the formation of a
current layer at the HFT, where the current dissipation can be mapped to the
X-shaped ribbons via field-aligned heat conduction. These results highlight the
critical role of HFTs in 3D magnetic reconnection and have important
implications for astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.

ecological patterns, which describe ecological communities at relatively large
spatial scales, are not only scale dependent, but also intimately intertwined.
The relative abundance of species, which informs us about the commonness and
rarity of species, changes its shape from small to large spatial scales. The
average number of species as a function of area has a steep initial increase,
followed by decreasing slopes at large scales. Finally, if we find a species in
a given location, it is more likely we find an individual of the same species
close-by, rather than farther apart. Such spatial turnover depends on the
geographical distribution of species, which often are spatially aggregated.
This reverberates on the abundances as well as the richness of species within a
region, but so far it has been difficult to quantify such relationships. Within
a neutral framework, which considers all individuals competitively equivalent,
we introduce a spatial stochastic model, which phenomenologically accounts for
birth, death, immigration and local dispersal of individuals. We calculate the
pair correlation function, which encapsulates spatial turnover, and the
conditional probability to find a species with a certain population within a
given circular area. Also, we calculate the macro-ecological patterns, which we
have referred to above, and compare the analytical formul{\ae} with the
numerical integration of the model. Finally, we contrast the model predictions

in driven nonlinear optical resonators. Their realization in microresonators
has enabled compact sources of coherent optical frequency combs as well as the
study of dissipative solitons. A key parameter of their dynamics is the
effective-detuning of the pump laser to the thermally- and Kerr-shifted cavity
resonance. Together with the free spectral range and dispersion, it governs the
soliton-pulse duration, as predicted by an approximate analytical solution of
the Lugiato-Lefever equation. Yet, a precise experimental verification of this
relation was lacking so far. Here, by measuring and controlling the
effective-detuning, we establish a new way of stabilizing solitons in
microresonators and demonstrate that the measured relation linking soliton
width and detuning deviates by less than 1 % from the approximate expression,
validating its excellent predictive power. Furthermore, a detuning-dependent
enhancement of specific comb lines is revealed, due to linear couplings between
mode-families. They cause deviations from the predicted comb power evolution,
and induce a detuning-dependent soliton recoil that modifies the pulse
repetition-rate, explaining its unexpected dependence on laser-detuning.
Finally, we observe that detuning-dependent mode-crossings can destabilize the
soliton, leading to an unpredicted soliton breathing regime (oscillations of
the pulse) that occurs in a normally-stable regime. Our results test the
approximate analytical solutions with an unprecedented degree of accuracy and
provide new insights into dissipative-soliton dynamics.

moments (spin and orbital) contrary to a nonmagnetic $f^6$ ($J=0$) ground-state
configuration of Sm in the gas phase. Application of DFT${}+{}$Hubbard-I (HIA)
and DFT${}+{}$exact diagonalization (ED) methods cures this problem, and yields
a nonmagnetic ground state with six $f$ electrons and $J=0$ for the Sm adatom.
Our calculations show that Nd adatom remains magnetic, with four localized $f$
electrons and $J=4.0$. These conclusions could be verified by STM and XAS
experiments.

robust qubit prototypes to practical problem sizes and to implement
comprehensive error correction for computational precision. Due to inevitable
quantum uncertainties in resonant control pulses, increasing the precision of
quantum gates comes with the expense of increased energy consumption.
Consequently, the power dissipated in the vicinity of the processor in a
well-working large-scale quantum computer seems unacceptably large in typical
systems requiring low operation temperatures. Here, we introduce a method for
qubit driving and show that it serves to decrease the single-qubit gate error
without increasing the average power dissipated per gate. Previously,
single-qubit gate error induced by a bosonic drive mode has been considered to
be inversely proportional to the energy of the control pulse, but we circumvent
this bound by reusing and correcting itinerant control pulses. Thus our work
suggests that heat dissipation does not pose a fundamental limitation, but a
necessary practical challenge in future implementations of large-scale quantum

to such a configuration. The electrons and ions are created by
tunnel-ionization of neutral atoms, and the resulting plasma is heated by
collisions. Electrons are driven by electromagnetic, convective and diffusive
sources and produce a macroscopic current which is responsible for THz
emission. The model naturally includes both, ionization current and
transition-Cherenkov mechanisms for THz emission, which are usually
investigated separately in the literature. The latter mechanism is shown to
dominate for single-color multi-cycle lasers pulses, where the observed THz
radiation originates from longitudinal electron currents. However, we find that
the often discussed oscillations at the plasma frequency do not contribute to
the THz emission spectrum. In order to predict the scaling of the conversion
efficiency with pulse energy and focusing conditions, we propose a simplified
description that is in excellent agreement with rigorous particle-in-cell
simulations.

basis of an analysis of the radiation condition in the Green tensor of the
elastodynamic wave equation. The modified formalism is applied to dislocations
moving uniformly in an anisotropic medium. In practice, accounting for
causality amounts to a simple analytic continuation procedure whereby to the
dislocation velocity is added an infinitesimal positive imaginary part. This
device allows for a straightforward computation of velocity-dependent field
expressions that are valid whatever the dislocation velocity ---including
supersonic regimes--- without needing to consider subsonic and supersonic cases
separately. As an illustration, the distortion field of a Somigliana
dislocation of the Peierls-Nabarro-Eshelby-type with finite-width core is
computed analytically, starting from the Green tensor of elastodynamics. To
obtain the result in the form of a single compact expression, use of the
modified Stroh formalism requires splitting the Green function into its
reactive and radiative parts. In supersonic regimes, the solution obtained
displays Mach cones, which are supported by Dirac measures in the Volterra
limit. From these results, an explanation of Payton's `backward' Mach cones
[R.G. Payton, Z. Angew. Math. Phys. 46, 282--288 (1995)] is given in terms of
slowness surfaces, and a simple criterion for their existence is derived. The
findings are illustrated by full-field calculations from analytical formulas
for a dislocation of finite width in iron, and by Huygens-type geometric
constructions of Mach cones from ray surfaces.

innovation and to the high user demands, those devices are integrating
extensive functionalities and developers are writing battery-draining apps,
which results in a surge of energy consumption of these devices. This scenario
leads many people to often look for opportunities to charge their devices at
public charging stations: the presence of such stations is already prominent
around public areas such as hotels, shopping malls, airports, gyms and museums,
and is expected to significantly grow in the future. While most of the time the
power comes for free, there is no guarantee that the charging station is not
maliciously controlled by an adversary, with the intention to exfiltrate data

field $\phi$ as $\phi \propto ln(\alpha+\beta a)$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$
are positive constants, to alleviate the problems of interacting holographic
dark energy models in Brans-Dicke theory. In this paper, the cosmological
evolution of a new agegraphic dark energy (NADE) model within the framework of
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe is analyzed with the same form of scalar
field in Brans-Dicke theory. We derive the equation of state parameter $w_D$
and deceleration parameter $q$ of NADE model. It is observed that
$w_D\rightarrow -1$ when $a\rightarrow \infty$, i.e., the NADE mimics
cosmological constant in the late time evolution. Indeed, due to the assumption
of logarithmic form of Brans-Dicke scalar field the NADE in Brans-Dicke theory
behaves like NADE in general relativity in the late time evolution. The NADE
model shows a phase transition from matter dominated phase in early time to
accelerated phase in late time. We further extend NADE model by including the
interaction between dark matter and NADE. In this case, $w_D$ definitely
crosses the phantom divide line ($w_D=-1$) in the late time evolution. The
phase transition from matter dominated to NADE dominated phase may be achieved
at early stage in interacting model. Further, we show that the interacting NADE
model resolves the cosmic coincidence problem as the energy density ratio may
evolve sufficiently slow at present.

of X-ray tomography. The X-ray tomograms provide information on the bulk of the
granular filling, and allows to determine the particle positions and
orientations inside the silo. In addition, it allows to calculate local packing
densities in different parts of the container. We find that in the flowing zone
of the silo particles show a preferred orientation and thereby a higher order.
Similarly to simple shear flows, the average orientation of the particles is
not parallel to the streamlines but encloses a certain angle with it. In most
parts of the hopper, the angular distribution of the particles did not reach
the one corresponding to stationary shear flow, thus the average orientation
angle in the hopper deviates more from the streamlines than in stationary shear
flows. In the flowing parts of the silo shear induced dilation is observed,
which is more pronounced for elongated grains than for nearly spherical
particles. The clogged state is characterized by a dome, i. e. the geometry of
the layer of grains blocking the outflow. The shape of the dome depends on the
particle shape.

continuous asteroid light curves, that has been unprecedented to date. In
general, we are interested in the photometric precision that the K2 Mission can
deliver on moving Solar System bodies. In particular, we investigate space
photometric optical light curves of main-belt asteroids. We study the K2
superstamps covering the M35 and Neptune/Nereid fields observed in the long
cadence (29.4-min sampling) mode. Asteroid light curves are generated by
applying elongated apertures. We use the Lomb-Scargle method to find
periodicities due to rotation. We derived K2 light curves of 924 main-belt
asteroids in the M35 field, and 96 in the path of Neptune and Nereid. The light
curves are quasi-continuous and several days long. K2 observations are
sensitive to longer rotational periods than usual ground-based surveys.
Rotational periods are derived for 26 main-belt asteroids for the first time.
The asteroid sample is dominated by faint (>20 mag) objects. Due to the
faintness of the asteroids and the high density of stars in the M35 field, only
4.0% of the asteroids with at least 12 data points show clear periodicities or
trend signalling a long rotational period, as opposed to 15.9% in the less
crowded Neptune field. We found that the duty cycle of the observations had to
reach ~60% in order to successfully recover rotational periods.

available in this region, including one-neutron separation energies, level
energies and the experimental $B(E2)$ values of isomers in $^{134,136,138}$Sn,
$^{130}$Cd, and $^{128}$Pd. New isomers are predicted in this region, $e.g.$ in
$^{135}$Sn, $^{131}$Cd, $^{129}$Pd, $^{132,134}$In and $^{130}$Ag, in which
almost no excited states are known experimentally yet. In the odd-odd
$^{132,134}$In and $^{130}$Ag, the predicted very long $E2$ life-times of the
low-lying $5^{-}$ states are discussed, demanding more information on the
related proton-neutron interaction. The low-lying states of $^{132}$In are
discussed in connection with the recently observed $\gamma$ rays. The predicted
$19/2^{-}$ isomer in $^{129}$Pd could decay by both electromagnetic transitions
and neutron emission with comparable partial life-times, making it a good
candidate for neutron radioactivity, a decay mode which is yet to be
discovered.

mass $1.212 \pm 0.050$ M$_{\odot}$ and $1.255^{+0.107}_{-0.054}$ M$_{\odot}$.
The stars are at the main sequence turnoff. While it is well known that the
radii of close-in giant planets are correlated with their equilibrium
temperatures, whether or not the radii of planets increase in time as their
hosts evolve and become more luminous is an open question. Looking at the
broader sample of well-characterized close-in transiting giant planets, we find
that there is a statistically significant correlation between planetary radii
and the fractional ages of their host stars, with a false alarm probability of
only 0.0041%. We find that the correlation between the radii of planets and the
fractional ages of their hosts is fully explained by the known correlation
between planetary radii and their present day equilibrium temperatures, however
if the zero-age main sequence equilibrium temperature is used in place of the
present day equilibrium temperature then a correlation with age must also be
included to explain the planetary radii. This suggests that, after contracting
during the pre-main-sequence, close-in giant planets are re-inflated over time
due to the increasing level of irradiation received from their host stars.
Prior theoretical work indicates that such a dynamic response to irradiation
requires a significant fraction of the incident energy to be deposited deep
within the planetary interiors.

a dataset split into fixed training and test partitions. However, the labelling
of the training set is time-consuming, especially as datasets grow in size and
complexity. Furthermore, this approach is not applicable to the home user, who
wants to intuitively group their media without tirelessly labelling the
content. Our interactive approach is able to iteratively cluster classes of
images and video. Our approach is based around the concept of an image
signature which, unlike a standard bag of words model, can express
co-occurrence statistics as well as symbol frequency. We efficiently compute
metric distances between signatures despite their inherent high dimensionality
and provide discriminative feature selection, to allow common and distinctive
elements to be identified from a small set of user labelled examples. These
elements are then accentuated in the image signature to increase similarity
between examples and pull correct classes together. By repeating this process
in an online learning framework, the accuracy of similarity increases
dramatically despite labelling only a few training examples. To demonstrate
that the approach is agnostic to media type and features used, we evaluate on
three image datasets (15 scene, Caltech101 and FG-NET), a mixed text and image
dataset (ImageTag), a dataset used in active learning (Iris) and on three
action recognition datasets (UCF11, KTH and Hollywood2). On the UCF11 video

activities of Heisenberg and of his talks during the years 1939 to 1945 can be
summarized in the following way. Like several other German physicists
Heisenberg was drafted by German Army Ordnance when war began in Europe in
September 1939 to investigate whether the energy from splitting Uranium nuclei
by neutrons could be used for technical and military purposes. Heisenberg found
that this is possible in principle but that military use would require such
enormous industrial expenditures that it would take many years and would be
impracticable while the war lasted. The project was therefore dropped by the
Nazi government in 1942. Heisenberg even refrained from calculating a precise
value for the critical mass of U 235. He was relieved that he was thus spared a
moral decision between obeying an order to build the bomb or risking his life
by refusing to be involved in the project or sabotaging it. He was happy to be
confined to a project of building a small test reactor under civilian
administration that the government had approved. In 1941 Heisenberg tried to
get the opinion of Niels Bohr in Copenhagen on what the international community
of nuclear physicist could possibly do or prevent regarding the long-range
technical feasibility of making nuclear weapons. Bohr completely misunderstood
the cautious approach of Heisenberg.

that have many properties in common. We here compare the two flows in detail
for parameter values where the Nusselt numbers, i.e. the thermal transport and
the angular momentum transport normalized by the corresponding laminar values,
coincide. We study turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection in air at Rayleigh
number Ra=1e7 and Taylor-Couette flow at shear Reynolds number Re_S=2e4 for two
different mean rotation rates but the same Nusselt numbers. For individual
pairwise related fields and convective currents, we compare the probability
density functions normalized by the corresponding root mean square values and
taken at different distances from the wall. We find one rotation number for
which there is very good agreement between the mean profiles of the two
corresponding quantities temperature and angular momentum. Similarly, there is
good agreement between the fluctuations in temperature and velocity components.
For the heat and angular momentum currents, there are differences in the
fluctuations outside the boundary layers that increase with overall rotation
and can be related to differences in the flow structures in the boundary layer
and in the bulk. The study extends the similarities between the two flows from
global quantities to local quantities and reveals the effects of rotation on
the transport.

(PHSD) transport approach which incorporates partonic and hadronic
degrees-of-freedom, a phase transition from hadronic to partonic matter -
Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) - and a dynamical hadronization of quarks and
antiquarks as well as final hadronic interactions. We investigate the role of
in-medium effects on the $K^*, \bar K^*$ meson dynamics by employing
Breit-Wigner spectral functions for the $K^*$'s with self-energies obtained
from a self-consistent coupled-channel G-matrix approach. Furthermore, we
confront the PHSD calculations with experimental data for p+p, Cu+Cu and Au+Au
collisions at energies up to $\sqrt{{s}_{NN}} = 200$~GeV. Our analysis shows
that at relativistic energies most of the final $K^*$s (observed
experimentally) are produced during the late hadronic phase, dominantly by the
$K+ \pi \to K^*$ channel, such that the fraction of the $K^*$s from the QGP is
small and can hardly be reconstructed from the final observables. The influence
of the in-medium effects on the $K^*$ dynamics at RHIC energies is rather
modest due to their dominant production at low baryon densities (but high meson
densities), however, it increases with decreasing beam energy. Moreover, we
find that the additional cut on the invariant mass region of the $K^*$ further
influences the shape and the height of the final spectra. This imposes severe
constraints on the interpretation of the experimental results.

we analyse the impact of three different types of noise on descriptors
extracted by two widely used feature extraction methods (LBP and HOG) and how
denoising the images can help to mitigate this problem. We carry out
experiments on two different datasets and consider several types of noise,

they pose threatens various underground engineering projects. Models to monitor
and control induced seismic hazard with traffic light systems should be
probabilistic, forward-looking, and updated as new data arrive. In this study,
we propose an Induced Seismicity Test Bench to test and rank such models; this
test bench can be used for model development, model selection, and ensemble
model building. We apply the test bench to data from the Basel 2006 and
Soultz-sous-For\^ets 2004 geothermal stimulation projects, and we assess
forecasts from two models: Shapiro and Smoothed Seismicity (SaSS) and
Hydraulics and Seismics (HySei). These models incorporate a different mix of
physics-based elements and stochastic representation of the induced sequences.
Our results show that neither model is fully superior to the other. Generally,
HySei forecasts the seismicity rate better after shut-in, but is only mediocre
at forecasting the spatial distribution. On the other hand, SaSS forecasts the
spatial distribution better and gives better seismicity rate estimates before
shut-in. The shut-in phase is a difficult moment for both models in both
reservoirs: the models tend to underpredict the seismicity rate around, and
shortly after, shut-in.

Manjunatha Prasad and Mohana for matrices in 2014, to the case of $*$-ring.
Some equivalent characterizations for elements in $R$ to be pseudo core

Novel approaches for dataset augmentation allowed to train CNNs from-scratch

functional have been limited by the need to find its derivative. The present
work overcomes this difficulty by directly learning the density-potential and
energy-density maps for test systems and various molecules. Both improved
accuracy and lower computational cost with this method are demonstrated by
reproducing DFT energies for a range of molecular geometries generated during
molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, the methodology could be applied
directly to quantum chemical calculations, allowing construction of density
functionals of quantum-chemical accuracy.

a significant extinction of numerous species on Earth, as recorded in the

the distance between the Sun and the SN, different types of threats have to be
considered, such as ozone depletion on Earth, causing increased exposure to the
Sun's ultraviolet radiation, or the direct exposure of lethal x-rays. Another
indirect effect is cloud formation, induced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere
which result in a drop in the Earth's temperature, causing major glaciations of
the Earth. The discovery of highly intensive gamma ray bursts (GRBs), which
could be connected to SNe, initiated further discussions on possible

cast as mixed-integer optimization problems (MIP). However, commercial MIP
solvers are designed to run on desktop computing platforms and are not suited
for embedded applications which are typically restricted by limited
computational power and memory. To alleviate these restrictions, we develop a
novel low-complexity, iterative method for a class of non-convex, non-smooth
optimization problems. This class of problems encompasses hybrid model
predictive control problems where the dynamics are piece-wise affine (PWA). We
give conditions such that the proposed algorithm has fixed points and show
that, under practical assumptions, our method is guaranteed to converge locally
to local minima. This is in contrast to other low-complexity methods in the
literature, such as the non-convex alternating directions method of multipliers
(ADMM), for which no such guarantees are known for this class of problems. By
interpreting the PWA dynamics as a union of polyhedra we can exploit the
problem structure and develop an algorithm based on operator splitting
procedures. Our algorithm departs from the traditional MIP formulation, and
leads to a simple, embeddable method that only requires matrix-vector
multiplications and small-scale projections onto polyhedra. We illustrate the
efficacy of the method on two numerical examples, achieving good closed-loop
performance with computational times several orders of magnitude smaller
compared to state-of-the-art MIP solvers. Moreover, it is competitive with ADMM
in terms of suboptimality and computation time, but additionally provides local

can play an even larger role in metal oxides, which exhibit moderate

solar heat based on the new law, due to J. R. Mayer, assumed the heat to be the
result of meteors or asteroids falling into the Sun. A different and more
successful version of gravitation-to-heat energy conversion was proposed by H.
Helmholtz in 1854 and further developed by W. Thomson. For more than forty
years the once so celebrated Helmholtz-Thomson contraction theory was accepted
as the standard theory of solar heat despite its prediction of an age of the
Sun of only 20 million years. In between the gradual demise of this theory and
the radically different one based on nuclear processes there was a period in
which radioactivity was considered a possible alternative to gravitational
contraction. The essay discusses various pre-nuclear ideas of solar energy
production, including the broader relevance of the question as it was conceived

identify the most suitable location to set up your shop? Choosing an optimal
physical location is a critical decision for numerous businesses, as many
factors contribute to the final choice of the location. In this paper, we seek
to address the issue by investigating the use of publicly available Facebook
Pages data---which include user check-ins, types of business, and business
locations---to evaluate a user-selected physical location with respect to a
type of business. Using a dataset of 20,877 food businesses in Singapore, we
conduct analysis of several key factors including business categories,
locations, and neighboring businesses. From these factors, we extract a set of
relevant features and develop a robust predictive model to estimate the
popularity of a business location. Our experiments have shown that the
popularity of neighboring business contributes the key features to perform
accurate prediction. We finally illustrate the practical usage of our proposed
approach via an interactive web application system.

established that $M\approx4N$ intensity measurements are necessary and

to exploit the sparsity in the original signal and develop low-complexity

transition region. We simulate the realistic tree-dimensional (3D) magnetic
field using the data from the photospheric magnetic field measurements and
assume the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Alfv\'en wave turbulence and its
non-linear dissipation to be the only source for heating the coronal plasma and
driving the solar wind. In closed field regions the dissipation efficiency in a
balanced turbulence is enhanced. In the coronal holes we account for a
reflection of the outward propagating waves, which is accompanied by generation
of weaker counter-propagating waves. The non-linear cascade rate degrades in
strongly imbalanced turbulence, thus resulting in colder coronal holes.
  The distinctive feature of the presented model is the description of the low
corona as almost-steady-state low-beta plasma motion and heat flux transfer
along the magnetic field lines. We trace the magnetic field lines through each
grid point of the lower boundary of the global corona model, chosen at some
heliocentric distance, $R=R_{b}\sim1.1\ R_\odot$ well above the transition
region. One can readily solve the plasma parameters along the magnetic field
line from 1D equations for the plasma motion and heat transport together with
the Alfv\'en wave propagation, which adequately describe physics within the
heliocentric distances range, $R_{\odot}<R<R_{b}$, in the low solar corona. By
interfacing this threaded-field-lines model with the full MHD global corona
model at $r=R_{b}$, we find the global solution and achieve a
faster-than-real-time performance of the model on $\sim200$ cores.
