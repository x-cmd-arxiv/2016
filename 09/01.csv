high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy. However, tissue in front of
the transducer and the deep location of kidney can cause significant losses to
the efficiency of the treatment. The effect of attenuation, refraction and
reflection due to different tissue types on HIFU therapy of the kidney was
studied using a nonlinear ultrasound simulation model. The geometry of the
tissue was derived from a computed tomography (CT) dataset of a patient which
had been segmented for water, bone, soft tissue, fat and kidney. The combined
effect of inhomogeneous attenuation and sound-speed was found to result in an
11.0 dB drop in spatial peak-temporal average (SPTA) intensity in the kidney
compared to pure water. The simulation without refraction effects showed a 6.3
dB decrease indicating that both attenuation and refraction contribute to the
loss in focal intensity. The losses due to reflections at soft tissue
interfaces were less than 0.1 dB. Focal point shifting due to refraction
effects resulted in -1.3, 2.6 and 1.3 mm displacements in x-, y- and
z-directions respectively. Furthermore, focal point splitting into several
smaller subvolumes was observed. The total volume of the secondary focal points
was approximately 46% of the largest primary focal point. This could
potentially lead to undesired heating outside the target location and longer
therapy times.

and if strong enough, can suppress the entanglement between electronic and

numerical diagonalization to find the polaritonic states for intermediate
numbers of molecules, and use these to define and validate accurate expressions

two phases: at design time, FEMOSAA automatically transposes the engineers'
design of SAS, expressed as a feature model, to fit the MOEA, creating new
chromosome representation and reproduction operators. At runtime, FEMOSAA
utilizes the feature model as domain knowledge to guide the search and further
extend the MOEA, providing a larger chance for finding better solutions. In

can achieve a balanced trade-off. We comprehensively evaluated FEMOSAA on two

explored. Depending upon their mass loss history and rotation rates, these
stars will end their lives as pulsational pair-instability supernovae producing
a great variety of observational transients with total durations ranging from
weeks to millennia and luminosities from 10$^{41}$ to over 10$^{44}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. No non-rotating model radiates more than $5 \times 10^{50}$ erg of
light or has a kinetic energy exceeding $5 \times 10^{51}$ erg, but greater
energies are possible, in principle, in magnetar-powered explosions which are
explored. Many events resemble Type Ibn, Icn, and IIn supernovae, and some
potential observational counterparts are mentioned. Some PPISN can exist in a
dormant state for extended periods, producing explosions millennia after their
first violent pulse. These dormant supernovae contain bright Wolf-Rayet stars,
possibly embedded in bright x-ray and radio sources. The relevance of PPISN to
supernova impostors like Eta Carinae, to super-luminous supernovae, and to
sources of gravitational radiation is discussed. No black holes between 52 and
133 solar masses are expected from stellar evolution in close binaries.

series analysis. A Bayesian approach requires the user to define a prior
distribution for the coefficients of the AR($p$) model. Although it is easy to
write down some prior, it is not at all obvious how to understand and interpret
the prior, to ensure that it behaves according to the users prior knowledge. In
this paper, we approach this problem using the recently developed ideas of
penalised complexity (PC) priors. These priors have important properties like
robustness and invariance to reparameterisations, as well as a clear
interpretation. A PC prior is computed based on specific principles, where
model component complexity is penalised in terms of deviation from simple base
model formulations. In the AR(1) case, we discuss two natural base model
choices, corresponding to either independence in time or no change in time. The
latter case is illustrated in a survival model with possible time-dependent
frailty. For higher-order processes, we propose a sequential approach, where
the base model for AR($p$) is the corresponding AR($p-1$) model expressed using
the partial autocorrelations. The properties of the new prior are compared with
the reference prior in a simulation study.

Accurate predictions of the He I spectrum are needed to determine the
primordial helium abundance to a precision of $< 1$% in order to constrain Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis models. Theoretical line emissivities at least this
accurate are needed if this precision is to be achieved. In the first paper of
this series, which focused on H I, we showed that differences in $l$-changing
collisional rate coefficients predicted by three different theories can
translate into 10% changes in predictions for H I spectra. Here we consider the
more complicated case of He atoms, where low-$l$ subshells are not energy
degenerate. A criterion for deciding when the energy separation between $l$
subshells is small enough to apply energy-degenerate collisional theories is
given. Moreover, for certain conditions, the Bethe approximation originally
proposed by Pengelly & Seaton (1964) is not sufficiently accurate. We introduce
a simple modification of this theory which leads to rate coefficients which
agree well with those obtained from pure quantal calculations using the
approach of Vrinceanu et al. (2012). We show that the $l$-changing rate
coefficients from the different theoretical approaches lead to differences of
$\sim 10$% in He I emissivities in simulations of H II regions using spectral

stellar-mass black holes, into supermassive black holes provides a wealth of
information about the strong gravitational-field regime via the emission of
gravitational waves. In order to detect and analyse these signals, accurate
waveform templates which include the effects of the compact object's
gravitational self-force are required. For computational efficiency, adiabatic
templates are often used. These accurately reproduce orbit-averaged
trajectories arising from the first-order self-force, but neglect other
effects, such as transient resonances, where the radial and poloidal
fundamental frequencies become commensurate. During such resonances the flux of
gravitational waves can be diminished or enhanced, leading to a shift in the
compact object's trajectory and the phase of the waveform. We present an
evolution scheme for studying the effects of transient resonances and apply
this to an astrophysically motivated population. We find that a large
proportion of systems encounter a low-order resonance in the later stages of
inspiral; however, the resulting effect on signal-to-noise recovery is small as
a consequence of the low eccentricity of the inspirals. Neglecting the effects
of transient resonances leads to a loss of 4% of detectable signals.

of discerning the sentiment of a particular tweet. (2) The number of crowd
workers is determined online, during an iterative crowd sourcing process, based
on inter-rater agreements between labels.We applied our approach to 1,000
twitter messages about the four U.S. presidential candidates Clinton, Cruz,
Sanders, and Trump, collected during February 2016. We implemented the two
proposed methods using decision trees that allocate more crowd efforts to
tweets predicted to be sarcastic. We show that our framework outperforms the
traditional static allocation scheme. It collects opinion labels from the crowd
at a much lower cost while maintaining labeling accuracy.

types of graded structures in different situations in order to show a
ubiquitous occurrence of energy rectification, even for the system under a
homogeneous magnetic field. Due to technical difficulties, we carry out the
computation for small chains, but we present arguments which indicate the
extension of some results to larger systems. Recalling the generic existence of
energy rectification in classical, graded materials, which are described by
anharmonic chains of oscillators, and recalling also the anharmonicity of these
XXZ models, which involve quartic terms in more transparent representation in
terms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators, we may say that our
results extend the ubiquity of energy rectification occurrence in classical
graded materials to the case of quantum systems.

the launch of eROSITA: an optical spectroscopic survey of X-ray selected,
massive ($\sim 10^{14}$ to $10^{15}~M_{\odot}$) galaxy clusters discovered in
ROSAT and XMM-Newton imaging. The immediate aim is to determine precise

\sim 0.6$. The scientific goal of the program is precision cosmology, using
clusters as probes of large-scale structure in the expanding Universe. We
present the cluster samples, target selection algorithms and observation
strategies. We demonstrate the efficiency of selecting targets using a
combination of SDSS imaging data, a robust red-sequence finder and a dedicated
prioritization scheme. We describe a set of algorithms and work-flow developed
to collate spectra and assign cluster membership, and to deliver catalogues of
spectroscopically confirmed clusters. We discuss the relevance of line-of-sight
velocity dispersion estimators for the richer systems. We illustrate our
techniques by constructing a catalogue of 230 spectroscopically validated

for halo sub-structures in a sample of 412 RR Lyrae stars (RRLS) that covers a
$\sim 525$ square degrees region of the Virgo Overdensity (VOD) and spans
distances from the Sun from 4 to 75 kpc. With a friends-of-friends algorithm we
identified six high significance groups of RRLS in phase space, which we
associate mainly with the VOD and with the Sagittarius stream. Four other
groups were also flagged as less significant overdensities. Three high
significance and 3 lower significance groups have distances between $\sim 10$
and 20 kpc, which places them with the distance range attributed by others to
the VOD. The largest of these is the Virgo Stellar Stream (VSS) at 19 kpc,
which has 18 RRLS, a factor of 2 increase over the number known previously.
While these VOD groups are distinct according to our selection cirteria, their
overlap in position and distance, and, in a few cases, similarity in radial
velocity are suggestive that they may not all stem separate accretion events.
Even so, the VOD appears to be caused by more than one overdensity. The Sgr
stream is a very obvious feature in the background of the VOD at a mean
distance of 44 kpc. Two additional high significant groups were detected at
distances $>40$ kpc. Their radial velocities and locations differ from the
expected path of the Sgr debris in this part of the sky, and they are likely to
be remnants of other accretion events.

excess of neutrinos, relative to Poisson fluctuations of the near-isotropic

the bright flares of Mrk 421 that occurred during the IC40 run, and one for
excess neutrinos associated with the brightest emission periods of five other

flux-associated neutrinos from each search. These limits are consistent with
previous point-source searches and Fermi GeV flux-correlated searches. Our

  A Study on the Performance Scores",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although a great methodological effort has been invested in proposing
competitive solutions to the class-imbalance problem, little effort has been
made in pursuing a theoretical understanding of this matter.
  In order to shed some light on this topic, we perform, through a novel
framework, an exhaustive analysis of the adequateness of the most commonly used
performance scores to assess this complex scenario. We conclude that using
unweighted H\""older means with exponent $p \leq 1$ to average the recalls of
all the classes produces adequate scores which are capable of determining
whether a classifier is competitive.
  Then, we review the major solutions presented in the class-imbalance
literature. Since any learning task can be defined as an optimisation problem
where a loss function, usually connected to a particular score, is minimised,
our goal, here, is to find whether the learning tasks found in the literature
are also oriented to maximise the previously detected adequate scores. We
conclude that they usually maximise the unweighted H\""older mean with $p = 1$
(a-mean).
  Finally, we provide bounds on the values of the studied performance scores
which guarantee a classifier with a higher recall than the random classifier in
each and every class.

contingencies (e.g., severe weather, plant outages) most electricity markets
have institutions in charge of monitoring market performance and mitigating
market power. The latter task is often achieved by producing estimates of
marginal costs (also referred to as ""reference levels"") that may replace the
actual bids by generators with market power. In this paper, we propose an
iterative mechanism that constitutes an alternative to outright regulatory
intervention in those sporadic situations in which market power is a
significant concern. The iterative mechanism proposed is based upon relatively
simple information exchange between the market maker and market participants
and is equipped to handle general non-linear (convex) constraints related to
technical and/or reliability requirements. We show the mechanism proposed has
many desirable properties (approximately): incentive compatibility, efficiency,
individual rationality and (weak) budget balance. In addition, we show it is
robust to imperfect information regarding costs. To illustrate we consider its
application to the joint clearing of day ahead dispatch and reserves, an
approach that has been proposed for the large-scale integration of renewable
generation. In this context, we relax the assumption that each generator has
perfect information on its own expected marginal costs of adjustment and show
the mechanism retains most of its properties.

spiral arms structure play an important role in the evolution of the disks of
spiral galaxies. The epicyclic approximation allows the determination of the
corresponding resonant radii on the equatorial plane (for nearly circular
orbits), but is not suitable in general.
  Aims: We expand the study of resonant orbits by analysing stellar motions
perturbed by spiral arms with Gaussian-shaped profiles without any restriction
on the stellar orbital configurations, and we expand the concept of Lindblad
(epicyclic) resonances for orbits with large radial excursions.
  Methods: We define a representative plane of initial conditions, which covers
the whole phase space of the system. Dynamical maps on representative planes
are constructed numerically, in order to characterize the phase-space structure
and identify the precise location of resonances. The study is complemented by
the construction of dynamical power spectra, which provide the identification
of fundamental oscillatory patterns in the stellar motion.
  Results: Our approach allows a precise description of the resonance chains in
the whole phase space, giving a broader view of the dynamics of the system when
compared to the classical epicyclic approach, even for objects in retrograde
motion. The analysis of the solar neighbourhood shows that, depending on the
current azimuthal phase of the Sun with respect to the spiral arms, a star with
solar kinematic parameters may evolve either inside the stable co-rotation
resonance or in a chaotic zone.
  Conclusions: Our approach contributes to quantifying the domains of resonant
orbits and the degree of chaos in the whole Galactic phase-space structure. It
may serve as a starting point to apply these techniques to the investigation of
clumps in the distribution of stars in the Galaxy, such as kinematic moving
groups.

shortcuts to adiabaticity. In one approach, a counterdiabatic quantum
Hamiltonian $\hat H_{CD}$ is constructed to suppress nonadiabatic excitations.
In the analogous classical problem, a counterdiabatic classical Hamiltonian
$H_{CD}$ ensures that the classical action remains constant even under rapid
driving. Both the quantum and classical versions of this problem have been
solved for the special case of scale-invariant driving, characterized by linear
expansions, contractions or translations of the system. Here we investigate an
example of a non-scale-invariant system -- a tilted piston. We solve exactly
for the classical counterdiabatic Hamiltonian $H_{CD}(q,p,t)$, which we then
quantize to obtain a Hermitian operator $\hat H_{CD}(t)$. Using numerical
simulations, we find that $\hat H_{CD}$ effectively suppresses non-adiabatic

and Extract Method refactorings. However, extending these catalogs of
transformations is complex and time-consuming. A similar phenomenon appears in
intelligent tutoring systems where instructors have to write cumbersome code
transformations that describe ""common faults"" to fix similar student
submissions to programming assignments. We present REFAZER, a technique for
automatically generating program transformations. REFAZER builds on the
observation that code edits performed by developers can be used as examples for
learning transformations. Example edits may share the same structure but
involve different variables and subexpressions, which must be generalized in a
transformation at the right level of abstraction. To learn transformations,
REFAZER leverages state-of-the-art programming-by-example methodology using the
following key components: (a) a novel domain-specific language (DSL) for
describing program transformations, (b) domain-specific deductive algorithms
for synthesizing transformations in the DSL, and (c) functions for ranking the
synthesized transformations. We instantiate and evaluate REFAZER in two
domains. First, given examples of edits used by students to fix incorrect
programming assignment submissions, we learn transformations that can fix other
students' submissions with similar faults. In our evaluation conducted on 4
programming tasks performed by 720 students, our technique helped to fix
incorrect submissions for 87% of the students. In the second domain, we use
repetitive edits applied by developers to the same project to synthesize a
program transformation that applies these edits to other locations in the code.
In our evaluation conducted on 59 scenarios of repetitive edits taken from 3 C#
open-source projects, REFAZER learns the intended program transformation in 83%
of the cases.

societies, and they continue to do so today. To help reduce their impact,
mathematical models of disease transmission have been studied to help
understand disease dynamics and inform prevention strategies. Vaccination - one
of the most important preventive measures of modern times - is of great
interest both theoretically and empirically. And in contrast to traditional
approaches, recent research increasingly explores the pivotal implications of
individual behavior and heterogeneous contact patterns in populations. Our
report reviews the developmental arc of theoretical epidemiology with emphasis
on vaccination, as it led from classical models assuming homogeneously mixing
(mean-field) populations and ignoring human behavior, to recent models that
account for behavioral feedback and/or population spatial/social structure.
Many of the methods used originated in statistical physics, such as lattice and
network models, and their associated analytical frameworks. Similarly, the
feedback loop between vaccinating behavior and disease propagation forms a
coupled nonlinear system with analogs in physics. We also review the new
paradigm of digital epidemiology, wherein sources of digital data such as
online social media are mined for high-resolution information on
epidemiologically relevant individual behavior. Armed with the tools and
concepts of statistical physics, and further assisted by new sources of digital
data, models that capture nonlinear interactions between behavior and disease
dynamics offer a novel way of modeling real-world phenomena, and can help
improve health outcomes. We conclude the review by discussing open problems in
the field and promising directions for future research.

processing tasks when compared to classical models. These advantages range from
computational speeds-up to security improvements. A key question is where these
advantages come from. The toy model developed by Spekkens [R. W. Spekkens PRA
75, 032110 (2012)] mimics many of the features of quantum mechanics, such as
entanglement and no-cloning, regarded as being important in this regard,
despite being a local hidden variable theory. In this work we study several
protocols within Spekkens' toy model where we see it can also mimic the
advantages and limitations shown in the quantum case. We first provide explicit
proofs for the impossibility of toy bit-commitment and the existence of a toy
error correction protocol and consequent $k-$threshold secret sharing. Then,
defining a toy computational model based on the quantum one-way computer we
prove the existence of blind and verified protocols. Importantly, these two
last quantum protocols are known to achieve a better-than-classical security.
Our results suggest that such quantum improvements need not arise from any
Bell-type non locality or contextuality, but rather as a consequence of
steering correlations.

systematic approach of constructing subgrid-scale models, based on the idea
that it is desirable that subgrid-scale models are consistent with the
mathematical and physical properties of the Navier-Stokes equations and the
turbulent stresses. To that end, we first discuss in detail the symmetries of
the Navier-Stokes equations, and the near-wall scaling behavior, realizability
and dissipation properties of the turbulent stresses. We furthermore summarize
the requirements that subgrid-scale models have to satisfy in order to preserve
these important mathematical and physical properties. In this fashion, a
framework of model constraints arises that we apply to analyze the behavior of
a number of existing subgrid-scale models that are based on the local velocity
gradient. We show that these subgrid-scale models do not satisfy all the
desired properties, after which we explain that this is partly due to
incompatibilities between model constraints and limitations of
velocity-gradient-based subgrid-scale models. However, we also reason that the
current framework shows that there is room for improvement in the properties
and, hence, the behavior of existing subgrid-scale models. We furthermore show
how compatible model constraints can be combined to construct new subgrid-scale
models that have desirable properties built into them. We provide a few
examples of such new models, of which a new model of eddy viscosity type, that
is based on the vortex stretching magnitude, is successfully tested in
large-eddy simulations of decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence and
turbulent plane-channel flow.

systems of strongly interacting bosons, with finite-dimensional site Hilbert
spaces, in two spatial dimensions. The construction proceeds by introducing
exactly soluble models with chiral edges, which in the presence of many-body
localization (MBL) in the bulk are argued to lead to stable chiral phases.
These chiral phases do not require any symmetry, and in fact owe their
existence to the absence of energy conservation in driven systems.
Surprisingly, we show that they are classified by a quantized many-body index,
which is well defined for any MBL Floquet system. The value of this index,
which is always the logarithm of a positive rational number, can be interpreted
as the entropy per Floquet cycle pumped along the edge, formalizing the notion
of quantum-information flow. We explicitly compute this index for specific
models, and show that the nontrivial topology leads to edge thermalization,
which provides an interesting link between bulk topology and chaos at the edge.

their relation to chiral bosonic phases.

supermassive black holes (SBHs) in galactic nuclei formed in mergers followed
by a formation and coalescence of a binary SBH. Such systems initially have a
deficit of stars on low-angular-momentum orbits caused by the slingshot process
during the binary SBH stage, which tends to reduce the flux of stars into the
SBH compared to the steady-state value. On the other hand, a newly formed
galactic nucleus has a non-spherical shape which enhances the mixing of stars
in angular momentum and thus the TDE rate. In galaxies with relatively low SBH
masses (<10^7 Msun), relaxation times are short enough to wash out the
anisotropy in initial conditions, and for more massive SBH the enhancement of
flux due to non-sphericity turns out to be more important than its suppression
due to initial anisotropy. Therefore, the present-day TDE rates generally
exceed conventional steady-state estimates based on a spherical isotropic
approximation. We thus conjecture that the lower observationally inferred TDE
rates compared to theoretical predictions cannot be attributed to the depletion
of low-angular-momentum stars by SBH binaries.

continuum observations of ASASSN-14li, one of the best studied tidal disruption

unresolved. At 5.0 GHz with ~3x2mas resolution, the radio emission shows an
extended structure that can be modeled with two components: a core-like
component and a fainter, possibly elongated source 4.3mas (~2pc) away. Our
observations are not conclusive as to the nature of the components, but three
scenarios are discussed. One possibility is a core-jet/outflow morphology, thus
making of ASASSN-14li the first TDE jet/outflow directly imaged. For this case,
the projected separation between the two components can only be explained by
superluminal motion, rather than the lower velocities inferred from
low-resolution radio observations. However, typical fast moving jets have
brightness temperatures ~5 orders of magnitude higher than we find, thus making
this scenario less likely. The second possibility is that we are imaging a
non-relativistic jet from past AGN/TDE activity. In this case a past TDE is
preferred given that the spatial extension and radio luminosity of the
elongated component are consistent with the theoretical predictions for a TDE
outflow. Alternatively, the two sources could indicate the presence of a binary
black hole, which would then naturally explain the enhanced TDE rates of
post-starburst galaxies. Future EVN observations will help us to distinguish

observed ionic column densities, absorption-line widths and relative
velocities, along with the ratios of NV/OVI for 39 fitted Voigt profile
components of OVI. We compare these quantities with the predictions given by a
wide range of ionization models. Photoionization models that include only
extragalactic UV background radiation are ruled out; conservatively, the upper
limits to NV/OVI and measurements of N$_{\rm OVI}$ imply unphysically large
path lengths > 100 kpc. Furthermore, very broad OVI absorption (b > 40 km
s$^{-1}$) is a defining characteristic of the CGM of star-forming L* galaxies.
We highlight two possible origins for the bulk of the observed OVI: (1) highly
structured gas clouds photoionized primarily by local high energy sources or
(2) gas radiatively cooling on large scales behind a supersonic wind.
Approximately 20% of circumgalactic OVI does not align with any low-ionization
state gas within $\pm$50 km s$^{-1}$ and is found only in halos with M$_{\rm

absorption traces the hot corona itself at a characteristic temperature of
10$^{5.5}$ K. We discuss the implications of these very distinct physical
origins for the dynamical state, gas cooling rates, and total baryonic content
of L* gaseous halos.

makes it undetectable at redshifts $z\gtrsim1$. We however demonstrate that the
BAO peak can still be detected in the radial 21cm power spectrum and describe a
method to make this type of measurements. By means of numerical simulations,
containing the 21cm cosmological signal as well as the most relevant Galactic
and extra-Galactic foregrounds and basic instrumental effect, we quantify the
precision with which the radial BAO scale can be measured in the 21cm power
spectrum. We systematically investigate the signal-to-noise and the precision
of the recovered BAO signal as a function of cosmic variance, instrumental
noise, angular resolution and foreground contamination. We find that the
expected noise levels of SKA would degrade the final BAO errors by $\sim5\%$
with respect to the cosmic-variance limited case at low redshifts, but that the
effect grows up to $\sim65\%$ at $z\sim2-3$. Furthermore, we find that the
radial BAO signature is robust against foreground systematics, and that the
main effect is an increase of $\sim20\%$ in the final uncertainty on the
standard ruler caused by the contribution of foreground residuals as well as
the reduction in sky area needed to avoid high-foreground regions. We also find
that it should be possible to detect the radial BAO signature with high
significance in the full redshift range. We conclude that a 21cm experiment
carried out by the SKA should be able to make direct measurements of the
expansion rate $H(z)$ with competitive per-cent level precision on redshifts

that the emission is mildly polarized and that there is an anticorrelation

attributed to the formation of caustics in the current sheet. Each pulse of

of all the star formation in a galaxy's lifetime across the population of
quenched AGN host galaxies, and that histories of slower quenching, attributed
to secular (non-violent) evolution, are also key in their evolution. This is in
agreement with recent results showing both merger-driven and non-merger
processes are contributing to the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive
black holes. The availability of gas in the reservoirs of a galaxy, and its
ability to be replenished, appear to be the key drivers behind this
co-evolution.

transport. However, the dc resistivity continues to increase with temperature
above 200 K due to the loss of Drude spectral weight. The loss of Drude
spectral weight with increasing temperature is seen in a wide temperature range
in the uncollapsed tetragonal phase, and this spectral weight is recovered at
energy scales about one order of magnitude larger than the Fermi energy scale

other correlated metals in which the dominant interactions are electronic in

with $\mathcal{H}$ a Hilbert space, from intensity measurements $|F(\omega)|$,
where $F(\omega):=\langle f , \varphi_\omega\rangle$ are measurements of $f$
with respect to a measurement system $(\varphi_\omega)_{\omega\in
\Omega}\subset \mathcal{H}$. Although phase retrieval is always stable in the
finite dimensional setting whenever it is possible (i.e. injectivity implies
stability for the inverse problem), the situation is drastically different if
$\mathcal{H}$ is infinite-dimensional: in that case phase retrieval is never
uniformly stable [8, 4]; moreover the stability deteriorates severely in the
dimension of the problem [8]. On the other hand, all empirically observed
instabilities are of a certain type: they occur whenever the function $|F|$ of
intensity measurements is concentrated on disjoint sets $D_j\subset \Omega$,
i.e., when $F= \sum_{j=1}^k F_j$ where each $F_j$ is concentrated on $D_j$ (and
$k \geq 2$). Motivated by these considerations we propose a new paradigm for
stable phase retrieval by considering the problem of reconstructing $F$ up to a
phase factor that is not global, but that can be different for each of the
subsets $D_j$, i.e., recovering $F$ up to the equivalence $$ F \sim
\sum_{j=1}^k e^{i \alpha_j} F_j.$$ We present concrete applications (for
example in audio processing) where this new notion of stability is natural and
meaningful and show that in this setting stable phase retrieval can actually be
achieved, for instance if the measurement system is a Gabor frame or a frame of
Cauchy wavelets.

  overlap with arXiv:1409.6941",,,,"cs.SY stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is now well known that flexibility of energy consumption can be harnessed
for the purposes of grid-level ancillary services. In particular, through
distributed control of a collection of loads, a balancing authority regulation
signal can be tracked accurately, while ensuring that the quality of service
(QoS) for each load is acceptable {\it on average}. In this paper it is argued
that a histogram of QoS is approximately Gaussian, and consequently each load
will eventually receive poor service. Statistical techniques are developed to
estimate the mean and variance of QoS as a function of the power spectral
density of the regulation signal. It is also shown that additional local
control can eliminate risk: The histogram of QoS is {\it truncated} through
this local control, so that strict bounds on service quality are guaranteed.
While there is a tradeoff between the grid-level tracking performance (capacity
and accuracy) and the bounds imposed on QoS, it is found that the loss of
capacity is minor in typical cases.

lensed by its strong gravitational field, illuminating the last photon orbit.
This results in a dark circular area known as the black hole 'shadow'. The
Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a (sub)mm VLBI network capable of
Schwarzschild-radius resolution on Sagittarius A* (or Sgr A*), the 4 million
solar mass black hole at the Galactic Center. The goals of the Sgr A*
observations include resolving and measuring the details of its morphology.
However, EHT data are sparse in the visibility domain, complicating reliable
detailed image reconstruction. Therefore, direct pixel imaging should be
complemented by other approaches. Using simulated EHT data from a black hole
emission model we consider an approach to Sgr A* image reconstruction based on
a simple and computationally efficient analytical model that produces images
similar to the synthetic ones. The model consists of an eccentric ring with a
brightness gradient and a two-dimensional Gaussian. These elemental forms have
closed functional representations in the visibility domain, which lowers the
computational overhead of fitting the model to the EHT observations. For model
fitting we use a version of the Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm based
on the Metropolis-Hastings sampler with replica exchange. Over a series of
simulations we demonstrate that our model can be used for determining geometric
measures of a black hole, thus providing information on the shadow size,
linking General Relativity with accretion theory.

local state and the mean-field of all sub-populations, in the second, all
agents observe their local state but the mean-field of only a subset of the
sub-populations. Both information structures are non-classical and not
partially nested. Nonetheless, it is shown that linear control strategies are
optimal for the first and approximately optimal for the second, the
approximation error is inversely proportional to the size of the
sub-populations whose mean-fields are not observed. The corresponding gains are
determined by the solution of K+1 decoupled standard Riccati equations, where K
is the number of sub-populations. The dimensions of the Riccati equations do
not depend on the size of the sub-populations, thus the solution complexity is
independent of the number of agents. Generalizations to major-minor agents,

revisited the zero-temperature phase diagram of stoichiometric SrCoO3, a

considered both bulk and epitaxial thin film geometries. In the bulk case, we
found that a tetragonal P4/mbm phase with moderate Jahn-Teller distortions and
c/a ratio of ~1/sqrt{2} is consistently predicted to have a lower energy than
the thus far assumed ground-state cubic Pm-3m phase. In thin films, we found
two phase transitions occurring at compressive and tensile epitaxial strains.
However, in contrast to previous theoretical predictions, our results show
that: (i) the phase transition induced by tensile strain is isostructural and
involves only a change in magnetic spin order (that is, not a metallic to
insulator transformation), and (ii) the phase transition induced by compressive
strain comprises simultaneous structural, electronic and magnetic spin order
changes, but the required epitaxial stress is so large (<-6%) that is unlikely
to be observed in practice. Our findings call for a revision of the

selected infrared red quasars with very strong and peculiar ultraviolet Fe ii
emission lines: strong UV Fe II UV arising from transitions to ground/low
excitation levels, and very weak Fe II at wavelengths longer than 2800 {\AA}.
The spectra of these quasars display strong resonant emission lines, such as C
IV, Al III and Mg II but sometimes, a lack of non-resonant lines such as C
III], S III and He II. We interpret the Fe II lines as resonantly scattered
light from the extended outflows that are viewed nearly edge-on, so that the
accretion disk and broad line region are obscured by the dusty torus, while the
extended outflows are not. We show that dust free gas exposed to strong
radiation longward of 912 {\AA} produces Fe II emission very similar to that
observed. The gas is too cool to collisionally excite Fe II lines, accounting
for the lack of optical emission. The spectral energy distribution from the UV
to the mid-infrared can be modeled as emission from a clumpy dusty torus, with
UV emission being reflected/scattered light either by the dusty torus or the
outflow. Within this scenario, we estimate a minimum covering factor of the
outflows from a few to 20% for the Fe II scattering region, suggesting that Fe
II BAL quasars are at a special stage of quasar evolution.

evolution of node and link states. In particular, we focus on the interplay
between the use of a language and the preference or attitude of the speakers
towards it, which we model, respectively, as a property of the interactions
between speakers (a link state) and as a property of the speakers themselves (a
node state). Furthermore, we restrict our attention to the case of two socially
equivalent languages and to socially inspired network topologies based on a
mechanism of triadic closure. As opposed to most of the previous literature,
where language extinction is an inevitable outcome of the dynamics, we find a
broad range of possible asymptotic configurations, which we classify as: frozen
extinction states, frozen coexistence states, and dynamically trapped
coexistence states. Moreover, metastable coexistence states with very long
survival times and displaying a non-trivial dynamics are found to be abundant.
Interestingly, a system size scaling analysis shows, on the one hand, that the
probability of language extinction vanishes exponentially for increasing system
sizes and, on the other hand, that the time scale of survival of the
non-trivial dynamical metastable states increases linearly with the size of the
system. Thus, non-trivial dynamical coexistence is the only possible outcome
for large enough systems. Finally, we show how this coexistence is
characterized by one of the languages becoming clearly predominant while the
other one becomes increasingly confined to ""ghetto-like"" structures: small
groups of bilingual speakers arranged in triangles, with a strong preference
for the minority language, and using it for their intra-group interactions
while they switch to the predominant language for communications with the rest
of the population.

community search algorithms ignore these attributes and result in communities
with poor cohesion w.r.t. their node attributes. In this paper, we study the
problem of attribute-driven community search, that is, given an undirected
graph $G$ where nodes are associated with attributes, and an input query $Q$
consisting of nodes $V_q$ and attributes $W_q$, find the communities containing
$V_q$, in which most community members are densely inter-connected and have
similar attributes.
  We formulate our problem of finding attributed truss communities (ATC), as
finding all connected and close k-truss subgraphs containing $V_q$, that are
locally maximal and have the largest attribute relevance score among such
subgraphs. We design a novel attribute relevance score function and establish
its desirable properties. The problem is shown to be NP-hard. However, we
develop an efficient greedy algorithmic framework, which finds a maximal
$k$-truss containing $V_q$, and then iteratively removes the nodes with the
least popular attributes and shrinks the graph so as to satisfy community
constraints. We also build an elegant index to maintain the known $k$-truss
structure and attribute information, and propose efficient query processing
algorithms. Extensive experiments on large real-world networks with
ground-truth communities shows the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed
methods.

understanding of the dynamics of spiral arms is changing from the traditional
spiral model to a dynamically evolving spiral model. In this study, we
investigate the structure and evolution of GMCs in a dynamically evolving
spiral arm using a three-dimensional N-body/hydrodynamic simulation of a barred
spiral galaxy at parsec-scale resolution. This simulation incorporated
self-gravity, molecular hydrogen formation, radiative cooling, heating due to
interstellar far-ultraviolet radiation, and stellar feedback by both HII
regions and Type-II supernovae. In contrast to a simple expectation based on
the traditional spiral model, the GMCs exhibited no systematic evolutionary
sequence across the spiral arm. Our simulation showed that the GMCs behaved as
highly dynamic objects with eventful lives involving collisional build-up,
collision-induced star formation, and destruction via stellar feedback. The GMC
lifetimes were predicted to be short, only a few tens of millions years. We
also found that, at least at the resolutions and with the feedback models used
in this study, most of the GMCs without HII regions were collapsing, but half
of the GMCs with HII regions were expanding owing to the HII-region feedback
from stars within them. Our results support the dynamic and feedback-regulated
GMC evolution scenario. Although the simulated GMCs were converging rather than
virial equilibrium, they followed the observed scaling relationship well. We
also analysed the effects of galactic tides and external pressure on GMC
evolution and suggested that GMCs cannot be regarded as isolated systems since
their evolution in disc galaxies is complicated because of these environmental
effects.

sensitivity to dark energy, modified gravity and alternative cosmological
scenarios. Most previous studies in the literature of void properties use
cosmological N-body simulations of dark matter (DM) particles that ignore the
potential effect of baryonic physics. Using a spherical underdensity finder, we
analyse voids using the mass field and subhalo tracers in the EAGLE
simulations, which follow the evolution of galaxies in a $\rm{\Lambda}$ cold
dark matter Universe with state-of-the-art subgrid models for baryonic
processes in a $(100 \rm{cMpc})^3$ volume. We study the effect of baryons on
void statistics by comparing results with DM-only simulations that use the same
initial conditions as EAGLE. When identifying voids in the mass field, we find
that a DM-only simulation produces 24 per cent more voids than a hydrodynamical
one due to the action of galaxy feedback polluting void regions with hot gas,
specially for small voids with $r_{\rm{void}} \le 10\ \rm{Mpc}$. We find that
the way in which galaxy tracers are selected has a strong impact on the
inferred void properties. Voids identified using galaxies selected by their
stellar mass are larger and have cuspier density profiles than those identified
by galaxies selected by their total mass. Overall, baryons have minimal effects
on void statistics, as void properties are well captured by DM-only
simulations, but it is important to account for how galaxies populate DM haloes
to estimate the observational effect of different cosmological models on the
statistics of voids.

measured using neutrons is uniquely powerful for probing such magnetic states.
We discover unusual signals, including an unprecedented column of scattering
over a large energy interval around the Brillouin zone center which is
remarkably stable with temperature. This is straightforwardly accounted for in

compromised a subset of hosts within the network. Since the likelihood ratio
detector requires integrating over the time each host be- comes compromised, we
illustrate how to use Monte Carlo methods to compute the requisite integral. We

estimations of algorithmic complexity based upon Solomonoff-Levin's theory of
algorithmic probability providing a closer connection to algorithmic complexity
than previous attempts based on statistical regularities e.g. as spotted by
some popular lossless compression schemes. The strategy behind BDM is to find
small computer programs that produce the components of a larger, decomposed
object. The set of short computer programs can then be artfully arranged in
sequence so as to produce the original object and to estimate an upper bound on
the length of the shortest computer program that produces said original object.
We show that the method provides efficient estimations of algorithmic
complexity but that it performs like Shannon entropy when it loses accuracy. We
estimate errors and study the behaviour of BDM for different boundary
conditions, all of which are compared and assessed in detail. The measure may
be adapted for use with more multi-dimensional objects than strings, objects
such as arrays and tensors. To test the measure we demonstrate the power of CTM
on low algorithmic-randomness objects that are assigned maximal entropy (e.g.
$\pi$) but whose numerical approximations are closer to the theoretical low
algorithmic-randomness expectation. We also test the measure on larger objects
including dual, isomorphic and cospectral graphs for which we know that
algorithmic randomness is low. We also release implementations of the methods

Using this theoretical hypothesis and the Fermi residuals we calculate Bayesian
evidences, including Fermi-LAT exclusion limits from 15 dwarf spheroidal

compatible with the simplified dark matter model. In the most preferred
scenario the dark matter (mediator) mass is in the 100-500 (1-200) GeV range
and its annihilation is dominated by top quark final state. Less preferred but

an order of magnitude lower dark matter mass. Our conclusion is that the

the network to choose sub-sets of a problem which are most amenable to its

interfere with its learning. To do this, the network first transforms the raw
data into a higher-level categorical representation, and then trains a
predictor from that new time series to its future. To prevent a trivial
solution of mapping the signal to zero, we introduce a measure of
non-triviality via a contrast between the prediction error of the learned model

discard uninformative and unpredictable components of the signal in favor of
the features which are both highly predictive and highly predictable. This
creates a coarse-grained model of the time-series dynamics, focusing on
predicting the slowly varying latent parameters which control the statistics of

type, a detailed review of existing formulations of Kirchhoff-Love and

proposed and existing formulations. Two different rotation interpolation
schemes with strong or weak Kirchhoff constraint enforcement, respectively, as
well as two different choices of nodal triad parametrizations in terms of
rotation or tangent vectors are proposed. The combination of these schemes
leads to four novel finite element variants, all of them based on a
C1-continuous Hermite interpolation of the beam centerline. Essential
requirements such as representability of general 3D, large-deformation, dynamic
problems involving slender beams with arbitrary initial curvatures and
anisotropic cross-section shapes or preservation of objectivity and
path-independence will be investigated analytically and verified numerically
for the different formulations. It will be shown that the geometrically exact
Kirchhoff-Love beam elements proposed in this work are the first ones of this
type that fulfill all the considered requirements. On the contrary,
Simo-Reissner type formulations fulfilling these requirements can be found in
the literature very well. However, it will be argued that the shear-free
Kirchhoff-Love formulations can provide considerable numerical advantages when
applied to highly slender beams. Concretely, several representative numerical
test cases confirm that the proposed Kirchhoff-Love formulations exhibit a
lower discretization error level as well as a considerably improved nonlinear
solver performance in the range of high beam slenderness ratios as compared to
two representative Simo-Reissner element formulations from the literature.

provides a possible mechanism for the formation of such low-mass objects. The
kinematic and binary properties of very low-mass objects formed through disc
fragmentation at early times (< 10 Myr) were discussed in Li et al. (2015). In
this paper we extend the analysis by following the long-term evolution of
disc-fragmented systems, up to an age of 10 Gyr, covering the ages of the
stellar and substellar population in the Galactic field. We find that the
systems continue to decay, although the rates at which companions escape or
collide with each other are substantially lower than during the first 10 Myr,
and that dynamical evolution is limited beyond 1 Gyr. By t = 10 Gyr, about one
third of the host stars is single, and more than half have only one companion
left. Most of the other systems have two companions left that orbit their host
star in widely separated orbits. A small fraction of companions have formed
binaries that orbit the host star in a hierarchical triple configuration. The
majority of such double companion systems have internal orbits that are
retrograde with respect to their orbits around their host stars. Our
simulations allow a comparison between the predicted outcomes of
disc-fragmentation with the observed low-mass hydrogen-burning stars, brown
dwarfs, and planetary-mass objects in the Solar neighborhood. Imaging and
radial velocity surveys for faint binary companions among nearby stars are
necessary for verification or rejection for the formation mechanism proposed in
this paper.

  The arguments employed here are quite different from theirs, and the basic
idea comes from \cite{QX2}, originally motivated by \cite{SZW2,SZW12,TS}. We
obtain an almost-sharp $O(\varepsilon\ln(r_0/\varepsilon))$ convergence rate in
$L^2$ space, and a sharp $O(\varepsilon)$ error estimate in
$L^{\frac{2d}{d-1}}$ space by a little stronger assumption.
  Under the dimensional condition $d=2$, we also establish the optimal
$O(\varepsilon)$ convergence rate on pressure terms in $L^2$ space. Then
utilizing the convergence rates we can derive the $W^{1,p}$ estimates uniformly
down to microscopic scale $\varepsilon$ without any smoothness assumption on
the coefficients, where $|\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{2}|<\frac{1}{2d}+\epsilon$ and
$\epsilon$ is a positive constant independent of $\varepsilon$. Combining the
local estimates, based upon $\text{VMO}$ coefficients, consequently leads to
the uniform $W^{1,p}$ estimates. Here the proofs do not rely on the well known
compactness methods.

on a dense, open subset of the smallest semi-algebraic set enclosing the set of
rank-$r$ tensors. We analyze the effectiveness of Kruskal's criterion when it
is combined with reshaping. It is proved that this criterion is effective for
both real and complex tensors in its entire range of applicability, which is
usually much smaller than the smallest typical rank. Our proof explains when
reshaping-based algorithms for computing tensor rank decompositions may be
expected to recover the decomposition. Specializing the analysis to symmetric
tensors or forms reveals that the reshaped Kruskal criterion may even be
effective up to the smallest typical rank for some third, fourth and sixth
order symmetric tensors of small dimension as well as for binary forms of
degree at least three. We extended this result to $4 \times 4 \times 4 \times
4$ symmetric tensors by analyzing the Hilbert function, resulting in a
criterion for symmetric identifiability that is effective up to symmetric rank

the detection window are occluded, since not every sub-part of the window is
discriminative on its own. To address this issue, we propose a novel loss layer
for CNNs, named grid loss, which minimizes the error rate on sub-blocks of a
convolution layer independently rather than over the whole feature map. This
results in parts being more discriminative on their own, enabling the detector
to recover if the detection window is partially occluded. By mapping our loss
layer back to a regular fully connected layer, no additional computational cost
is incurred at runtime compared to standard CNNs. We demonstrate our method for
face detection on several public face detection benchmarks and show that our
method outperforms regular CNNs, is suitable for realtime applications and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

research labs to the consumer devices' market, programming them remains
challenging. Despite the improvements made by High-Level Synthesis (HLS), which
removed the language and paradigm barriers that prevented many computer
scientists from working with them, producing a new design typically requires at
least several hours, making data- and context-dependent adaptations virtually
impossible.
  In this paper we present a new framework that off-loads, on-the-fly and
transparently to both the user and the developer, computationally-intensive
code fragments to FPGAs. While the performance should not surpass that of
hand-crafted HDL code, or even code produced by HLS, our results come with no
additional development costs and do not require producing and deploying a new
bit-stream to the FPGA each time a change is made. Moreover, since
optimizations are made at run-time, they may fit particular datasets or usage
scenarios, something which is rarely foreseeable at design or compile time.
  Our proposal revolves around an overlay architecture that is pre-programmed
on the FPGA and dynamically reconfigured by our framework to execute code
fragments extracted from the Data Flow Graph (DFG) of computational intensive
routines. We validated our solution using standard benchmarks and proved we are
able to off-load to FPGAs without developer's intervention.

technology that is expected to have far-reaching socioeconomic, environmental,
and geopolitical implications. As use of this technology increases, it will
become more common to produce functional parts, including components for
safety-critical systems. AM's dependence on computerization raises the concern
that the manufactured part's quality can be compromised by sabotage. This paper
demonstrates the validity of this concern, as we present the very first full
chain of attack involving AM, beginning with a cyber attack aimed at
compromising a benign AM component, continuing with malicious modification of a
manufactured object's blueprint, leading to the sabotage of the manufactured
functional part, and resulting in the physical destruction of a cyber-physical
system that employs this part. The contributions of this paper are as follows.
We propose a systematic approach to identify opportunities for an attack
involving AM that enables an adversary to achieve his/her goals. Then we
propose a methodology to assess the level of difficulty of an attack, thus
enabling differentiation between possible attack chains. Finally, to
demonstrate the experimental proof for the entire attack chain, we sabotage the
3D printed propeller of a quadcopter UAV, causing the quadcopter to literally
fall from the sky.

structure, evolution, and energetics, as well as their geoeffectiveness.
However, we currently lack routine diagnostics of the near-Sun CME magnetic
field, which is crucial for determining the subsequent evolution of CMEs.
Methods. We recently presented a method to infer the near-Sun magnetic field
magnitude of CMEs and then extrapolate it to 1 AU. This method uses relatively
easy to deduce observational estimates of the magnetic helicity in CME-source
regions along with geometrical CME fits enabled by coronagraph observations. We
hereby perform a parametric study of this method aiming to assess its
robustness. We use statistics of active region (AR) helicities and CME
geometrical parameters to determine a matrix of plausible near-Sun CME magnetic
field magnitudes. In addition, we extrapolate this matrix to 1 AU and determine
the anticipated range of CME magnetic fields at 1 AU representing the radial
falloff of the magnetic field in the CME out to interplanetary (IP) space by a
power law with index aB. Results. The resulting distribution of the near-Sun
(at 10 Rs ) CME magnetic fields varies in the range [0.004, 0.02] G, comparable
to, or higher than, a few existing observational inferences of the magnetic
field in the quiescent corona at the same distance. We also find that a
theoretically and observationally motivated range exists around aB = -1.6
+-0.2, thereby leading to a ballpark agreement between our estimates and
observationally inferred field magnitudes of magnetic clouds (MCs) at L1.
Conclusions. In a statistical sense, our method provides results that are
consistent with observations.

reconstruction based on a sum of Dirac delta functions denoted as
Quadrature-Based Moment Methods (QBMM) in order to capture large scale
trajectory crossing, or by using low order hydrodynamics closures in the
Levermore hierarchy denoted as Kinetic-Based Moment Methods (KBMM) in order to
capture small scale trajectory crossing. Whereas KBMM leads to well-posed PDEs
and has a hard time capturing large scale trajectory crossing for particles
with enough inertia, QBMM based on a discrete reconstruction suffers from
singularity formation and requires too many moments in order to capture the
effect of PTC at both small scale and large scale both to small-scale
turbulence as well as free transport coupled to drag in an Eulerian mesoscale
framework. The challenge addressed in this work is thus twofold: first, to
propose a new generation of method at the interface between QBMM and KBMM with
less singular behavior and the associated proper mathematical properties, which
is able to capture both small scale and large scale trajectory crossing, and
second to limit the number of moments used for applicability in 2-D and 3-D
configurations without losing too much accuracy in the representation of
spatial fluxes. In order to illustrate its numerical properties, the proposed
Gaussian extended quadrature method of moments (Gaussian-EQMOM) is applied to
solve 1-D and 2-D kinetic equations representing finite-Stokes-number particles

household air pollution contributing substantial components of the overall
global disease burden. One of the key drivers of adverse health effects is fine
particulate matter ambient pollution (PM$_{2.5}$) to which an estimated 3
million deaths can be attributed annually. The primary source of information
for estimating exposures has been measurements from ground monitoring networks
but, although coverage is increasing, there remain regions in which monitoring
is limited. Ground monitoring data therefore needs to be supplemented with
information from other sources, such as satellite retrievals of aerosol optical
depth and chemical transport models. A hierarchical modelling approach for
integrating data from multiple sources is proposed allowing spatially-varying
relationships between ground measurements and other factors that estimate air
quality. Set within a Bayesian framework, the resulting Data Integration Model
for Air Quality (DIMAQ) is used to estimate exposures, together with associated
measures of uncertainty, on a high resolution grid covering the entire world.
Bayesian analysis on this scale can be computationally challenging and here
approximate Bayesian inference is performed using Integrated Nested Laplace
Approximations. Model selection and assessment is performed by cross-validation
with the final model offering substantial increases in predictive accuracy,
particularly in regions where there is sparse ground monitoring, when compared
to current approaches: root mean square error (RMSE) reduced from 17.1 to 10.7,
and population weighted RMSE from 23.1 to 12.1 $\mu$gm$^{-3}$. Based on

from community detection algorithms. The need for deception emerges whenever a
group of entities (e.g., activists, police enforcements) want to cooperate
while concealing their existence as a community. In this paper we introduce and
formalize the community deception problem. To solve this problem, we describe
algorithms that carefully rewire the connections of C's members. We
experimentally show how several existing community detection algorithms can be
deceived, and quantify the level of deception by introducing a deception score.
We believe that our study is intriguing since, while showing how deception can
be realized it raises awareness for the design of novel detection algorithms
robust to deception techniques.

statistical artifacts introduced by the choice of the reference period prior to

40%, and also that b) the definition of `dry regions of the globe' affect the

increases in heavy precipitation in the world's dry regions. Adequate data
pre-processing approaches and accounting for uncertainties regarding the

The scheme is based on the framework of finite-difference Langevin-equation,
similar to that used for molecular-dynamics simulations. This allows one to
calculate the drift and diffusion coefficients in any point of the
full-dimensional system. The width of the distribution of drift and diffusion
coefficients in an ensemble of microscopic points at the same value of Y
indicates to which extent the dynamics of Y is described by a simple Langevin
equation. Using a simple protein model we show that collective variables often
used to describe biopolymers display a non-negligible width both in the drift

force is compatible with the equilibrium free--energy calculated from a
microscopic sampling, but results in markedly different dynamical properties.

Starting with a list of particle positions sampled at different time points, we
assign particle identities by minimizing the sum across all particles of the
trace of the square of the strain tensor. This method of tracking corresponds
to minimizing the stored energy in an elastic solid or the dissipated energy in
a viscous fluid. Our energy-minimizing approach extends the advantages of
particle tracking to situations where particle imaging velocimetry and digital
imaging correlation are typically required. This approach is much more reliable
than the standard squared-displacement minimizing approach for
spatially-correlated displacements that are larger than the typical
interparticle spacing. Thus, it is suitable for particles embedded in a
material undergoing large deformations. On the other hand, squared-displacement
minimization is more effective for particles undergoing uncorrelated random
motion. In the Supplement, we include a flexible MATLAB particle tracker that
implements either approach. This implementation returns an estimation of the
strain tensor for each particle, in addition to its identification.

for real applications. This paper addresses the problem of event recognition by
proposing a convolutional neural network that exploits knowledge of objects and
scenes for event classification (OS2E-CNN). Intuitively, it stands to reason
that there exists a correlation among the concepts of objects, scenes, and
events. We empirically demonstrate that the recognition of objects and scenes
substantially contributes to the recognition of events. Meanwhile, we propose
an iterative selection method to identify a subset of object and scene classes,
which help to more efficiently and effectively transfer their deep
representations to event recognition. Specifically, we develop three types of
transferring techniques: (1) initialization-based transferring, (2)
knowledge-based transferring, and (3) data-based transferring. These newly
designed transferring techniques exploit multi-task learning frameworks to
incorporate extra knowledge from other networks and additional datasets into
the training procedure of event CNNs. These multi-task learning frameworks turn
out to be effective in reducing the effect of over-fitting and improving the
generalization ability of the learned CNNs. With OS2E-CNN, we design a
multi-ratio and multi-scale cropping strategy, and propose an end-to-end event
recognition pipeline. We perform experiments on three event recognition
benchmarks: the ChaLearn Cultural Event Recognition dataset, the Web Image
Dataset for Event Recognition (WIDER), and the UIUC Sports Event dataset. The
experimental results show that our proposed algorithm successfully adapts
object and scene representations towards the event dataset and that it achieves
the current state-of-the-art performance on these challenging datasets.

their multiplexing capability, which allows for building cameras with a large

necessary to arrange detectors close in readout frequency. Consequently KIDs
overlap in frequency and are coupled to each other producing crosstalk. Because
crosstalk can be only minimised by improving the array design, in this work we
aim to correct for this effect a posteriori. We analysed a MKID array
consisting of 880 KIDs with readout frequencies at 4-8 GHz. We measured the
beam patterns for every detector in the array and described the response of
each detector by using a two-dimensional Gaussian fit. Then, we identified
detectors affected by crosstalk above -30 dB level from the maximum and removed
the signal of the crosstalking detectors. Moreover, we modelled the crosstalk
level for each KID as a function of the readout frequency separation starting
from the assumption that the transmission of a KID is a Lorenztian function in
power. We were able to describe the general crosstalk level of the array and
the crosstalk of each KID within 5 dB, so enabling the design of future arrays
with the crosstalk as a design criterion. In this work, we demonstrate that it
is possible to process MKID images a posteriori to decrease the crosstalk
effect, subtracting the response of each coupled KID from the original map.

with patterned substrates. The substrate is modelled as a periodic array of
parallel infinite grooves of well-defined cross section sculpted on a
chemically homogeneous substrate which favors local homeotropic anchoring of
the nematic. We consider three cases: a sawtooth, a crenellated and a
sinusoidal substrate. We analyse this problem within the modified Frank-Oseen
formalism. We argue that, for substrate periodicities much larger than the
extrapolation length, the existence of different nematic textures with distinct
far-field orientations, as well as the anchoring transitions between them, are
associated with the presence of topological defects either on or close to the
substrate. For the sawtooth and sinusoidal case, we observe a homeotropic to
planar anchoring transition as the substrate roughness is increased. On the
other hand, a homeotropic to oblique anchoring transition is observed for
crenellated substrates. In this case, the anchoring phase diagram shows a
complex dependence on the substrate roughness and substrate anchoring strength.

safe operation. For this reason, verification and validation (V&V) approaches
must be developed that are suitable for this domain. Model checking is a formal
technique which allows us to exhaustively explore the paths of an abstract
model of a system. Using a probabilistic model checker such as PRISM, we may
determine properties such as the expected time for a mission, or the
probability that a specific mission failure occurs. However, model checking of
complex systems is difficult due to the loss of information during abstraction.
This is especially so when considering systems such as autonomous vehicles
which are subject to external influences. An alternative solution is the use of
Monte Carlo simulation to explore the results of a continuous-time model of the
system. The main disadvantage of this approach is that the approach is not
exhaustive as not all executions of the system are analysed. We are therefore
interested in developing a framework for formal verification of autonomous
vehicles, using Monte Carlo simulation to inform and validate our symbolic
models during the initial stages of development. In this paper, we present a
continuous-time model of a quadrotor unmanned aircraft undertaking an
autonomous mission. We employ this model in Monte Carlo simulation to obtain
specific mission properties which will inform the symbolic models employed in
formal verification.

the primary star to overfill its Roche lobe as it expands during the Asymptotic
Giant Branch (AGB) phase. The excess material ends up forming a common-envelope

droplet evaporation on chemically stripe-patterned surfaces is numerically
investigated using a thermal multiphase lattice Boltzmann (LB) model with
liquid-vapor phase change. A local force balance in the context of diffuse
interfaces is introduced to explain the equilibrium states of droplets on
chemically patterned surfaces. It is shown that, when the contact line is
pinned on a hydrophobic-hydrophilic boundary, different contact angles can be
interpreted as the variation of the length of the contact line occupied by each
component. The stick-slip-jump behavior of evaporating droplets on chemically
patterned surfaces is well captured by the LB simulations. Particularly, a slow
movement of the contact line is clearly observed during the stick (pinning)
mode, which shows that the pinning of the contact line during droplet
evaporation on chemically stripe-patterned surfaces is actually a dynamic
pinning process and the dynamic equilibrium is achieved by the self-adjustment
of the contact lines occupied by each component. Moreover, it is shown that,
when the surface tension varies with the temperature, the Marangoni effect has
an important influence on the depinning of the contact line, which occurs when
the horizontal component (towards the center of the droplet) of the force
caused by the Marangoni stress overcomes the unbalanced Young's force towards
outside.

quiescence in approximately a month. The X-ray spectrum was dominated by a
power-law with photon index between 1.6 and 1.8, which we interpreted as
thermal Comptonization in an electron cloud with temperature > 20 keV . A broad
({\sigma} ~ 1 keV) emission line was detected at an energy (E =
6.9$^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ keV) compatible with the K{\alpha} transition of ionized
Fe, suggesting an origin in the inner regions of the accretion disk. The
outburst flux and spectral properties shown during this outburst were
remarkably similar to those observed during the previous accretion event
detected from the source in 2009. Coherent pulsations at the pulsar spin period

properties that include distributions of their energy, phase and width. Two
modes of systematic sub-pulse drifting have been detected, with a periodicity
of 7 and 3 pulse periods. The two modes appear at different ranges of pulse
longitude but overlap under the main peak of the integrated profile. No
evidence for pulse micro-structure is seen with a time resolution down to 140
ns. In addition, we show that the fractional polarisation of single pulses
increases with their pulse peak flux density. By mapping the probability
density of linear polarisation position angle with pulse longitude, we reveal
the existence of two orthogonal polarisation modes. Finally, we find that the
resulting phase jitter of integrated profiles caused by single pulse
variability can be described by a Gaussian probability distribution only when
at least 100 pulses are used for integration. Pulses of different flux
densities and widths contribute approximately equally to the phase jitter, and
no improvement on timing precision is achieved by using a sub-set of pulses

symmetric channel (BSC). These upper bounds are very close to achievable rates,
and improve upon previously known feedback-based bounds for a large range of
channel parameters. For the binary-input Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)
channel, the upper bound is simplified to a small-scale numerical optimization
problem. These results provide some of the simplest upper bounds for an open
capacity problem that has theoretical and practical relevance.

bursts (GRBs) are highly polarized. The high polarization is used by some
authors to give a strict constraint on the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV).
If the Lorentz invariance is broken, the polarization vector of a photon may
rotate during its propagation. The rotation angle of polarization vector
depends on both the photon energy and the distance of source. It is believed
that if high polarization is observed, then the relative rotation angle
(denoted by $\alpha$) of polarization vector of the highest energy photon with
respect to that of the lowest energy photon should be no more than $\pi/2$.
Otherwise, the net polarization will be severely suppressed, thus couldn't be
as high as what was actually observed. In this paper, we will give a detailed
calculation on the evolution of GRB polarization arising from LIV effect
duration the propagation. It is shown that the polarization degree rapidly
decrease as $\alpha$ increases, and reaches a local minimum at $\alpha\approx
\pi$, then increases until $\alpha\approx 3\pi/2$, after that decreases again
until $\alpha \approx 2\pi$, etc. The polarization degree as a function of
$\alpha$ oscillates with a quasi-period $T\approx \pi$, while the oscillating
amplitude gradually decreases to zero. Moreover, we find that a considerable
amount (more than $60\%$ of the initial polarization) of polarization degree
can be conserved when $\alpha\approx \pi/2$. The polarization observation in a
higher and wider energy band, a softer photon spectrum, and a higher redshift
GRB is favorable in order to tightly constrain LIV effect.

latitude. However, surface differential rotation has been derived only for a
handful of individual giant stars to date.
  The spotted surface of the K-giant KU Pegasi is investigated in order to
detect its time evolution and quantify surface differential rotation.
  We present altogether 11 Doppler images from spectroscopic data collected
with the robotic telescope STELLA between 2006--2011. All maps are obtained
with the surface reconstruction code iMap. Differential rotation is extracted
from these images by detecting systematic (latitude-dependent) spot
displacements. We apply a cross-correlation technique to find the best
differential rotation law.
  The surface of KU Peg shows cool spots at all latitudes and one persistent
warm spot at high latitude. A small cool polar spot exists for most but not all
of the epochs. Re-identification of spots in at least two consecutive maps is
mostly possible only at mid and high latitudes and thus restricts the
differential-rotation determination mainly to these latitudes. Our
cross-correlation analysis reveals solar-like differential rotation with a
surface shear of $\alpha=+0.040\pm0.006$, i.e., approximately five times weaker
than on the Sun. We also derive a more accurate and consistent set of stellar
parameters for KU Peg including a small Li abundance of ten times less than

stellar and wind properties derived in a previous VFTS study, we constrained
the nitrogen abundance by fitting the equivalent widths of relatively strong

quality of the data, we constrained the nitrogen abundance in 38 cases; for 34
stars only upper limits could be derived, which includes almost all stars
rotating at $v_\mathrm{e}\sin i >200\,\mathrm{km s^{-1}}$. We analysed the
nitrogen abundance as a function of projected rotation rate $v_\mathrm{e}\sin
i$ and confronted it with predictions of rotational mixing. The upper limits on
the nitrogen abundance of the rapidly rotating stars are not in apparent
violation with theoretical expectations. However, we found a group of
N-enhanced slowly-spinning stars that is not in accordance with predictions of
rotational mixing in single stars. Among O-type stars with (rotation-corrected)
gravities less than $\log\,g_c = 3.75$ this group constitutes 30$-$40 percent

simulations of isolated spiral galaxies, and two galaxies from cosmological
simulations. Unlike previous numerical work, where typically each star particle
represents one `cluster', for the isolated galaxies we are able to model
features we term `clusters' with groups of particles. We compute the spatial
distribution of stars with different ages, and cluster mass distributions,
comparing our findings with observations including the recent LEGUS survey. We
find that spiral structure tends to be present in older (100s Myrs) stars and
clusters in the simulations compared to the observations. This likely reflects
differences in the numbers of stars or clusters, the strength of spiral arms,
and whether the clusters are allowed to evolve. Where we model clusters with
multiple particles, we are able to study their evolution. The evolution of
simulated clusters tends to follow that of their natal gas clouds. Massive,
dense, long-lived clouds host massive clusters, whilst short-lived clouds host
smaller clusters which readily disperse. Most clusters appear to disperse
fairly quickly, in basic agreement with observational findings. We note that
embedded clusters may be less inclined to disperse in simulations in a galactic
environment with continuous accretion of gas onto the clouds than isolated
clouds and correspondingly, massive young clusters which are no longer
associated with gas tend not to occur in the simulations. Caveats of our models
include that the cluster densities are lower than realistic clusters, and the
simplistic implementation of stellar feedback.

by studying the properties of reweighting factors and their variances at

fermionic reweighting determinant. In the numerical, stochastic, implementation
of the method, we find that the effect of reweighting is negligible in the case
of large volumes but it is sizeable when the volumes are small and the twisting
angles are large. More importantly, we find that for un-improved Wilson
fermions, and in small volumes, the dependence of the critical quark mass on
the twisting angle is quite pronounced and results in large violations of the
continuum dispersion relation.

transmissivity for a surface plasmon polariton incident on it from one side of
it than it has for a surface plasmon polariton incident on it from the opposite

the suppression of the zero-order Bragg beam which, for a certain value of the
modulation depth, is not transmitted through the structure, while the
diffraction efficiencies of the +1 and -1 Bragg beams can be modified by
varying the period of grating and/or the angle of incidence. For a certain

microturbulence. We use CO5BOLD hydrodynamical model atmospheres to
characterize the total granular brightness fluctuations and characteristic time
scale for FGK stars. Emphasis is put on the diagnostic potential of the
granulation background for constraining the fundamental atmospheric parameters.
We find a clear metallicity dependence of the granulation background. The
comparison between the model predictions and available observational
constraints at solar metallicity shows significant differences, that need
further clarification. Concerning microturbulence, we report on the derivation
of a theoretical calibration based on CO5BOLD models, which shows good
correspondence with the measurements for stars in the Hyades. We emphasize the
importance of a consistent procedure when determining the microturbulence, and
point to limitations of the commonly applied description of microturbulence in

low-surface brightnesses have been detected in the last year, and the nature of
these objects is under discussion. Aims. In this paper we report the detection
of two extended low-surface brightness (LSB) objects (mueff_g'~27 mag) found,
in projection, next to NGC 3193 and in the zone of the Hickson Compact Group
(HCG) 44, respectively. Methods. We analyzed deep, high-quality, GEMINI-GMOS
images with ELLIPSE within IRAF in order to obtain their brightness profiles
and structural parameters. We also search for the presence of globular clusters
(GC) in these fields. Results. We have found that, if these LSB galaxies were
at the distances of NGC 3193 and HCG 44, they would show sizes and luminosities
similar to those of the ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) found in the Coma cluster
and other associations. In that case, their sizes would be rather larger than
those displayed by the Local Group dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. We have
detected a few unresolved sources in the sky zone occupied by these galaxies
showing colors and brightnesses typical of blue globular clusters. Conclusions.
From the comparison of the properties of the galaxies presented in this work,
with those of similar objects reported in the literature, we have found that
LSB galaxies display sizes covering a quite extended continous range (reff ~
0.3 - 4.5 kpc), in contrast to ""normal"" early-type galaxies, which shows reff ~
1.0 kpc with a low dispersion. This fact might be pointing to different
formation processes for both types of galaxies.

result of the Marangoni effect, which describes flow due to surface tension
gradients. We find that both the wavelength and amplitude of the pattern
increase with temperature. Finally, and most important from a practical
viewpoint, the non-uniformities in the film thickness can be entirely avoided
simply by lowering the spin coating temperature.

local volatility (SLV) models to their underlying semidiscretized local
volatility (LV) models. Under an SLV model, it is common to approximate the
fair value of European-style options by semidiscretizing the backward
Kolmogorov equation using finite differences. In the present paper we introduce
an adjoint semidiscretization of the corresponding forward Kolmogorov equation.
This adjoint semidiscretization is used to obtain an expression for the
leverage function in the pertinent SLV model such that the approximated fair
values defined by the LV and SLV models are identical for non-path-dependent
European-style options. In order to employ this expression, a large non-linear
system of ODEs needs to be solved. The actual numerical calibration is
performed by combining ADI time stepping with an inner iteration to handle the
non-linearity. Ample numerical experiments are presented that illustrate the
effectiveness of the calibration procedure.

E=0$, where $\mathcal L=\mathcal L_{\lambda,\mu,n}$ is a family of differential
operators of order two. They depend on complex parameters $\lambda$, $\mu$,
$n$. Its restriction to real parameter domain $\lambda+\mu^2>0$ is a
linearization of the family of nonlinear equations on two-torus modeling the
Josephson effect in superconductivity. We show that for every $b,n\in\mathbb C$
satisfying a certain ""non-resonance condition"" and every $\lambda,\mu\in\mathbb

This result has several applications. First of all, it gives the description of
those $\lambda$, $\mu$, $n$, $b$ for which the monodromy of the Heun equation
has eigenvalue $e^{2\pi i b}$. It also describes those $\lambda$, $\mu$, $n$
for which the monodromy is parabolic: has multiple eigenvalue. We consider the
rotation number $\rho$ of the dynamical system on two-torus as a function of
parameters restricted to a surface $\lambda+\mu^2=const$. The phase-lock areas
are its level sets having non-empty interiors. For general families of
dynamical systems the problem to describe the boundaries of the phase-lock
areas is known to be very complicated. Here we include the results in this
direction obtained by methods of complex variables. In our case the phase-lock
areas exist only for integer rotation numbers (quantization effect). The result
on parabolic monodromy implies the description of the union of their boundaries
by an explicit functional equation. For every $\theta\notin\mathbb Z$ we get a
description of the set $\{\rho\equiv\pm\theta(mod2\mathbb Z)\}$.

the time-reversal symmetry and the magnitude of the adatom effective spin, we
identify which nanomagnets configurations are to be avoided and which are
promising to encode a stable bit. A new tool of investigation is introduced and
exploited: the quasi-spin quantum number. By means of this tool, our results
are easily generalized to a broad class of bipartite cluster configurations
where adatoms are coupled through Heisenberg-like interactions. Finally, to
make contact with the experiments, numerical simulations have been performed to
show how such stable configurations respond to typical scanning tunneling

probability distribution of height in a spatial point at a finite time.
Recently there has been spectacular progress in the studies of this quantity
for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in $1+1$ dimensions. Here we notice
that, at or above a critical dimension, the finite-time one-point height
distribution is ill-defined in a broad class of linear surface growth models,
unless the model is regularized at small scales. The regularization via a
system-dependent small-scale cutoff leads to a partial loss of universality. As
a possible alternative, we introduce a \emph{local average height}. For the
linear models the probability density of this quantity is well-defined in any
dimension. The weak-noise theory (WNT) for these models yields the ""optimal
path"" of the interface conditioned on a non-equilibrium fluctuation of the
local average height. As an illustration, we consider the conserved
Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) equation, where, without regularization, the finite-time
one-point height distribution is ill-defined in all physical dimensions. We
also determine the optimal path of the interface in a closely related problem
of the finite-time \emph{height-difference} distribution for the non-conserved
EW equation in $1+1$ dimension. Finally, we discuss a UV catastrophe in the
finite-time one-point distribution of height in the (non-regularized) KPZ
equation in $2+1$ dimensions.

generalizations of the classical monotone functions, which are the $1$-monotone

context of circuit complexity and learning theory, and by the central role that
monotonicity testing plays in the context of property testing, we initiate a
systematic study of $k$-monotone functions, in the property testing model. In
this model, the goal is to distinguish functions that are $k$-monotone (or are
close to being $k$-monotone) from functions that are far from being
$k$-monotone. Our results include the following:
  - We demonstrate a separation between testing $k$-monotonicity and testing
monotonicity, on the hypercube domain $\{0,1\}^d$, for $k\geq 3$;
  - We demonstrate a separation between testing and learning on $\{0,1\}^d$,
for $k=\omega(\log d)$: testing $k$-monotonicity can be performed with
$2^{O(\sqrt d \cdot \log d\cdot \log{1/\varepsilon})}$ queries, while learning
$k$-monotone functions requires $2^{\Omega(k\cdot \sqrt

provenance for complex, heterogenous software deployments is challenging,
requiring both the tedious instrumentation of many application components as
well as a unified architecture for aggregating information between components.
  In this work, we present a composition of techniques for bringing affordable

particular consideration for the exemplar domain of web services. We present
DAP, a transparent architecture for capturing detailed data provenance for web

DAP compatibility with existing web services without requiring instrumentation

less than 5.1 ms end-to-end overhead on web requests. Through the introduction
of a garbage collection optimization, DAP is able to monitor system activity
without suffering from excessive storage overhead. DAP thus serves not only as
a provenance-aware web framework, but as a case study in the non-invasive
deployment of provenance capabilities for complex applications workflows.

dust grains, which can trail the planet in a comet-like tail. When such objects
occult their host star, the resulting transit signal contains information about
the dust in the tail. We aim to use the detailed shape of the Kepler light
curve of KIC 12557548b to constrain the size and composition of the dust grains
that make up the tail, as well as the mass loss rate of the planet. Using a
self-consistent numerical model of the dust dynamics and sublimation, we
calculate the shape of the tail by following dust grains from their ejection
from the planet to their destruction due to sublimation. From this dust cloud
shape, we generate synthetic light curves (incorporating the effects of
extinction and angle-dependent scattering), which are then compared with the
phase-folded Kepler light curve. We explore the free-parameter space thoroughly
using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Our physics-based model is capable of
reproducing the observed light curve in detail. Good fits are found for initial
grain sizes between 0.2 and 5.6 micron and dust mass loss rates of 0.6 to 15.6
M_earth/Gyr (2-sigma ranges). We find that only certain combinations of
material parameters yield the correct tail length. These constraints are
consistent with dust made of corundum (Al2O3), but do not agree with a range of
carbonaceous, silicate, or iron compositions. Using a detailed, physically
motivated model, it is possible to constrain the composition of the dust in the
tails of evaporating rocky exoplanets. This provides a unique opportunity to
probe to interior composition of the smallest known exoplanets.

non-relationalist physical theories as they stand and interprets their formal
apparatus as the means of bookkeeping of the change of the distance relations

alternative theory strategy seeks to combine the relationalist ontology with a
relationalist physical theory that reproduces the predictions of the standard

learning pipelines. Typically it is solved by relying on generic optimization
techniques, that are optimal in the class of first-order methods for
non-smooth, convex functions, such as the Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm
and its accelerated version (ISTA, FISTA). However, these methods don't exploit
the particular structure of the problem at hand nor the input data
distribution. An acceleration using neural networks was proposed in
\cite{Gregor10}, coined LISTA, which showed empirically that one could achieve
high quality estimates with few iterations by modifying the parameters of the
proximal splitting appropriately.
  In this paper we study the reasons for such acceleration. Our mathematical
analysis reveals that it is related to a specific matrix factorization of the
Gram kernel of the dictionary, which attempts to nearly diagonalise the kernel
with a basis that produces a small perturbation of the $\ell_1$ ball. When this
factorization succeeds, we prove that the resulting splitting algorithm enjoys
an improved convergence bound with respect to the non-adaptive version.
Moreover, our analysis also shows that conditions for acceleration occur mostly
at the beginning of the iterative process, consistent with numerical
experiments. We further validate our analysis by showing that on dictionaries
where this factorization does not exist, adaptive acceleration fails.

in estimation of the integral kernel $b(s,t)$ of the conditional expectation
operator, where $s$ is an output variable while $t$ is a variable that
interacts with the predictor variable. This problem is an ill-posed inverse
problem, and we consider two estimators based on the functional principal
component analysis (PCA). We show that under suitable regularity conditions, an
estimator based on the single truncation attains the convergence rate for the
integrated squared error that is characterized by smoothness of the function $b
(s,t)$ in $t$ together with the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the covariance
operator, but the rate does not depend on smoothness of $b(s,t)$ in $s$. This
rate is shown to be minimax optimal, and consequently smoothness of $b(s,t)$ in
$s$ does not affect difficulty of estimating $b$. We also consider an
alternative estimator based on the double truncation, and provide conditions
under which the alternative estimator attains the optimal rate. We conduct
simulations to verify the performance of PCA-based estimators in the finite

the lifetime pattern of working hours and total income, and the relation

features handled by our methodology include change-points in the

and other similar irregularities, which we also refer to as generalised
change-points.
  Our methodology works with only minor modifications across a range of
generalised change-point scenarios, and we achieve such a high degree of
generality by proposing and using a new multiple generalised change-point
detection device, termed Narrowest-Over-Threshold (NOT). The key ingredient of
NOT is its focus on the smallest local sections of the data on which the
existence of a feature is suspected. Crucially, this adaptive localisation
technique prevents NOT from considering subsamples containing two or more
features, a key factor that ensures the general applicability of NOT.
  For selected scenarios, we show the consistency and near-optimality of NOT in
detecting the number and locations of generalised change-points. Furthermore,
we propose to select NOT's threshold (automatically) via the strengthened
Schwarz Information Criterion (sSIC) and give theoretical justifications. The
NOT estimators are easy to implement and rapid to compute: the entire
threshold-indexed solution path can be computed in close-to-linear time.
Importantly, the NOT approach is easy to extend by the user to tailor to their
own needs. There is no single competitor, but we show that the performance of
NOT matches or surpasses the state of the art in the scenarios tested. Our

  Systematic Review",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Animals play a profoundly important and intricate role in our lives today.
Dogs have been human companions for thousands of years, but they now work
closely with us to assist the disabled, and in combat and search and rescue
situations. Farm animals are a critical part of the global food supply chain,
and there is increasing consumer interest in organically fed and humanely
raised livestock, and how it impacts our health and environmental footprint.
Wild animals are threatened with extinction by human induced factors, and
shrinking and compromised habitat. This review sets the goal to systematically
survey the existing literature in smart computing and sensing technologies for
domestic, farm and wild animal welfare. We use the notion of \emph{animal
welfare} in broad terms, to review the technologies for assessing whether
animals are healthy, free of pain and suffering, and also positively stimulated
in their environment. Also the notion of \emph{smart computing and sensing} is
used in broad terms, to refer to computing and sensing systems that are not
isolated but interconnected with communication networks, and capable of remote
data collection, processing, exchange and analysis. We review smart
technologies for domestic animals, indoor and outdoor animal farming, as well
as animals in the wild and zoos. The findings of this review are expected to
motivate future research and contribute to data, information and communication
management as well as policy for animal welfare.

parameters, from the first and second RoboPol observing season. We investigate
whether gamma- ray--loud and gamma-ray--quiet blazars exhibit systematic
differences in their optical polarization properties. We find that
gamma-ray--loud blazars have a systematically higher polarization fraction
(0.092) than gamma-ray--quiet blazars (0.031), with the hypothesis of the two
samples being drawn from the same distribution of polarization fractions being
rejected at the 3{\sigma} level. We have not found any evidence that this
discrepancy is related to differences in the redshift distribution, rest-frame
R-band lu- minosity density, or the source classification. The median
polarization fraction versus synchrotron-peak-frequency plot shows an envelope
implying that high synchrotron- peaked sources have a smaller range of median
polarization fractions concentrated around lower values. Our gamma-ray--quiet
sources show similar median polarization fractions although they are all low
synchrotron-peaked. We also find that the random- ness of the polarization
angle depends on the synchrotron peak frequency. For high synchrotron-peaked
sources it tends to concentrate around preferred directions while for low
synchrotron-peaked sources it is more variable and less likely to have a pre-
ferred direction. We propose a scenario which mediates efficient particle
acceleration in shocks and increases the helical B-field component immediately
downstream of the shock.

  Indoor Environment","11 pages,9 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Vehicular
  Technology",,,,"stat.ML cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most existing fingerprints-based indoor localization approaches are based on
some single fingerprints, such as received signal strength (RSS), channel
impulse response (CIR), and signal subspace. However, the localization accuracy
obtained by the single fingerprint approach is rather susceptible to the
changing environment, multi-path, and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation.
Furthermore, building the fingerprints is a very time consuming process. In
this paper, we propose a novel localization framework by Fusing A Group Of
fingerprinTs (FAGOT) via multiple antennas for the indoor environment. We first
build a GrOup Of Fingerprints (GOOF), which includes five different
fingerprints, namely, RSS, covariance matrix, signal subspace, fractional low
order moment, and fourth-order cumulant, which are obtained by different
transformations of the received signals from multiple antennas in the offline
stage. Then, we design a parallel GOOF multiple classifiers based on AdaBoost
(GOOF-AdaBoost) to train each of these fingerprints in parallel as five strong
multiple classifiers. In the online stage, we input the corresponding
transformations of the real measurements into these strong classifiers to
obtain independent decisions. Finally, we propose an efficient combination
fusion algorithm, namely, MUltiple Classifiers mUltiple Samples (MUCUS) fusion
algorithm to improve the accuracy of localization by combining the predictions
of multiple classifiers with different samples. As compared with the single
fingerprint approaches, the prediction probability of our proposed approach is
improved significantly. The process for building fingerprints can also be
reduced drastically. We demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the
proposed algorithm through extensive simulations as well as via real
experimental data using a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) platform
with four antennas.

  learning: Photon intelligence",,,,,"cs.LG physics.optics quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding and using natural processes for intelligent functionalities,
referred to as natural intelligence, has recently attracted interest from a
variety of fields, including post-silicon computing for artificial intelligence
and decision making in the behavioural sciences. In a past study, we
successfully used the wave-particle duality of single photons to solve the
two-armed bandit problem, which constitutes the foundation of reinforcement
learning and decision making. In this study, we propose and confirm a
hierarchical architecture for single-photon-based reinforcement learning and
decision making that verifies the scalability of the principle. Specifically,
the four-armed bandit problem is solved given zero prior knowledge in a
two-layer hierarchical architecture, where polarization is autonomously adapted
in order to effect adequate decision making using single-photon measurements.
In the hierarchical structure, the notion of layer-dependent decisions emerges.
The optimal solutions in the coarse layer and in the fine layer, however,
conflict with each other in some contradictive problems. We show that while
what we call a tournament strategy resolves such contradictions, the
probabilistic nature of single photons allows for the direct location of the
optimal solution even for contradictive problems, hence manifesting the
exploration ability of single photons. This study provides insights into photon
intelligence in hierarchical architectures for future artificial intelligence
as well as the potential of natural processes for intelligent functionalities.

non-equilibrium properties of solids. Continuum partial differential equations
(PDEs) of atomic transport, phase transformations and mechanics often rely on
first and second derivatives of a free energy function. The stability, accuracy
and robustness of numerical methods to solve these PDEs are sensitive to the
particular functional representations of the free energy. In this communication
we investigate the influence of different representations of thermodynamic data
on phase field computations of diffusion and two-phase reactions in the solid
state. First-principles statistical mechanics methods were used to generate
realistic free energy data for HCP titanium with interstitially dissolved
oxygen. While Redlich-Kister polynomials have formed the mainstay of
thermodynamic descriptions of multi-component solids, they require high order
terms to fit oscillations in chemical potentials around phase transitions. Here
we demonstrate that high fidelity fits to rapidly fluctuating free energy
functions are obtained with spline functions. Spline functions that are many
degrees lower than Redlich-Kister polynomials provide equal or superior fits to
chemical potential data and, when used in phase field computations, result in
solution times approaching an order of magnitude speed up relative to the use
of Redlich-Kister polynomials.

lowering the cost and enhancing the capabilities of robotic and human

These systems promise major reduction in transport costs versus chemical

Lagrangian leads straightforwardly to the Einstein equation admitting as a
source the characteristic energy-momentum tensor of the inflaton field. Within
the dynamics of the inflation, e.g. in the slow roll transition from a
\qo{false} toward a \qo{true vacuum}, the inflaton's geometry implies a
temperature driven symmetry change between a highly symmetrical \qo{Weylan} to
a low symmetry \qo{Riemannian} scenario. Since the dynamics of the Weyl
curvature scalar, constructed over differentials of the inflaton field, has
been found to account for the quantum phenomenology at the microscopic scale,
the present work suggests interesting connections between the \qo{micro} and

technique for enhancing the banded structure of the frequency-domain channel

which performs close to optimal, is based on the criterion of maximum average
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The optimality of this
technique has been verified for stationary channels with perfectly known
statistics. However, in cases where this assumption does not hold, a near
optimal performance can be achieved at the expense of high complexity cost. To
overcome these limitations, an adaptive windowing technique is proposed that is
able to track the optimal receiver window offering low-complexity requirements.
Through simulation experiments it has been verified that the proposed technique
is able to adapt to the varying channel statistics with increased robustness to
channel modeling errors.
