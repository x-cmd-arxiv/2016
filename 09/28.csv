of the Universe using galaxy clustering with 2D angular cross-correlation
tomography in spectroscopic or high resolution photometric redshift surveys.
The radial information is contained in the cross correlations between narrow
redshift bins. We show how multiple tracers with redshift space distortions
cancel sample variance and arbitrarily improve the constraints on the dark
energy equation of state $\omega(z)$ and the growth parameter $\gamma$ in the
noiseless limit. The improvement for multiple tracers quickly increases with
the bias difference between the tracers, up to a factor $\sim4$ in
$\text{FoM}_{\gamma\omega}$. We model a magnitude limited survey with realistic
density and bias using a conditional luminosity function, finding a factor
1.3-9.0 improvement in $\text{FoM}_{\gamma\omega}$ -- depending on global
density -- with a split in a halo mass proxy. Partly overlapping redshift bins
improve the constraints in multiple tracer surveys a factor $\sim1.3$ in
$\text{FoM}_{\gamma\omega}$. This findings also apply to photometric surveys,
where the effect of using multiple tracers is magnified. We also show large
improvement on the FoM with increasing density, which could be used as a
trade-off to compensate some possible loss with radial resolution.

originally found by D. Denisenko on the digitized Palomar plates centered at

(nearly 2 magnitudes) variability with a period about 100.5 minutes. Using the
publicly available Catalina Sky Survey data from 2005 to 2013 we have improved
the value of period to 0.0697944 days. Comparison of the archival CRTS data
with more recent observations from Lajatico shows the dramatic changes in the
light curve shape. Instead of a single peak present in Catalina data before
2014, there were two peaks of nearly the same height during 2015. SDSS spectrum
taken in June 2009 shows prominent Helium emission lines between the bright
Balmer series. He II 4686 AA line has more than 30% effective width compared to
H_beta line. All those features allow us to interpret 1RXS J161935.7+524630 as
a magnetic cataclysmic variable (polar) with the accretion mode changing from
one pole before 2014 to two poles in 2015.

pressure is well established in observations and global climate models, and has
been used to imply that increased Sahel rainfall is caused by a stronger
shallow meridional circulation (SMC) over the Sahara. This study uses two
atmospheric reanalyses to examine interannual variability of Sahel rainfall and
the Saharan SMC, which consists of northward near-surface flow across the Sahel
into the Sahara and southward flow near 700 hPa out of the Sahara. During wet
Sahel years, the Saharan SMC shifts poleward, producing a drop in low-level
geopotential and surface pressure over the Sahara. Statistically removing the
effect of the poleward shift from the low-level geopotential eliminates
significant correlations between this geopotential and Sahel precipitation. As
the Saharan SMC shifts poleward, its mid-tropospheric divergent outflow
decreases, indicating a weakening of its overturning mass flux. The poleward
shift and weakening of the Saharan SMC during wet Sahel years is reproduced in
an idealized model of West Africa; a wide range of imposed sea surface
temperature and land surface albedo perturbations in this model produce a much
larger range of SMC variations that nevertheless have similar quantitative
associations with Sahel rainfall as in the reanalyses. These results disprove
the idea that enhanced Sahel rainfall is caused by strengthening of the Saharan
SMC. Instead, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the a
stronger SMC inhibits Sahel rainfall, perhaps by advecting mid-tropospheric
warm and dry air into the precipitation maximum.

shear geometry at low Reynolds number. As the flow becomes unstable via a
nonlinear subcritical instability, velocimetry measurements show non-periodic
fluctuations over a broad range of frequencies and wavelengths, consistent with
the main features of elastic turbulence. Using the same experimental setup, we
compare these features to those in the flow around cylinders, which is upstream
to the parallel shear region; we find significant differences in power spectra
scaling, intermittency statistics, and flow structures. We propose a simple
mechanism to explain the growth of velocity fluctuations in parallel shear
flows based on polymer stretching due to fluctuations in streamwise velocity
gradients.

available, to estimate the state of a stochastic process of interest. This
problem is important in applications such as target tracking and simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM). It is challenging since it involves stochastic
systems whose evolution is largely unknown, sensors with nonlinear
measurements, and limited operational resources that constrain the number of
active sensors at each measurement step. We provide an algorithm applicable to
general stochastic processes and nonlinear measurements whose time complexity
is linear in the planning horizon and whose performance is a multiplicative
factor 1/2 away from the optimal performance. This is notable because the
algorithm offers a significant computational advantage over the polynomial-time
algorithm that achieves the best approximation factor 1/e. In addition, for
important classes of Gaussian processes and nonlinear measurements corrupted
with Gaussian noise, our algorithm enjoys the same time complexity as even the
state-of-the-art algorithms for linear systems and measurements. We achieve our
results by proving two properties for the entropy of the batch state vector
conditioned on the measurements: a) it is supermodular in the choice of the
sensors; b) it has a sparsity pattern (involves block tri-diagonal matrices)
that facilitates its evaluation at each sensor set.

Estimates for $\rho_{cn}$ are also used to make NLO predictions. Finally, our
point charge radii are compared to other halo-EFT predictions, and setting the
core mass equal to the neutron mass our point charge radius is found to agree
with an analytical prediction in the unitary limit.

strongly lensed dusty, star-forming galaxy SPT-S J034640-5204.9 (hereafter
SPT0346-52) at $z$ = 5.656. This galaxy has also been observed with ALMA, HST,
Spitzer, Herschel, APEX, and the VLT. Previous observations indicate that if
the infrared (IR) emission is driven by star formation, then the inferred
lensing-corrected star formation rate ($\sim$ 4500 $M_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$) and
star formation rate surface density $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ ($\sim$ 2000 $M_{\sun}
{yr^{-1}} {kpc^{-2}}$) are both exceptionally high. It remained unclear from
the previous data, however, whether a central active galactic nucleus (AGN)
contributes appreciably to the IR luminosity. The {\it Chandra} upper limit
shows that SPT0346-52 is consistent with being star-formation dominated in the
X-ray, and any AGN contribution to the IR emission is negligible. The ATCA
radio continuum upper limits are also consistent with the FIR-to-radio
correlation for star-forming galaxies with no indication of an additional AGN
contribution. The observed prodigious intrinsic IR luminosity of (3.6 $\pm$
0.3) $\times$ 10$^{13}$ $L_{\sun}$ originates almost solely from vigorous star
formation activity. With an intrinsic source size of 0.61 $\pm$ 0.03 kpc,
SPT0346-52 is confirmed to have one of the highest $\Sigma_{SFR}$ of any known
galaxy. This high $\Sigma_{SFR}$, which approaches the Eddington limit for a
radiation pressure supported starburst, may be explained by a combination of
very high star formation efficiency and gas fraction.

in the theoretical framework of dark matter. N-body simulations are
indispensable for the analysis of the formation and evolution of the dark
matter web. Two primary fields - density and velocity fields - are used in most
of studies. However dark matter provides two additional fields which are unique
for collisionless media only. These are the multi- stream field in Eulerian
space and flip-flop field in Lagrangian space. The flip-flop field represents
the number of sign reversals of an elementary volume of each collisionless
fluid element. This field can be estimated by counting the sign reversals of
the Jacobian at each particle at every time step of the simulation. The
Jacobian is evaluated by numerical differentiation of the Lagrangian
submanifold, i.e., the three-dimensional dark matter sheet in the
six-dimensional space formed by three Lagrangian and three Eulerian
coordinates. We present the results of the statistical study of the evolution
of the flip-flop field from z = 50 to the present time z = 0. A number of
statistical characteristics show that the pattern of the flip-flop field
remains remarkably stable from z = 30 to the present time. As a result the
flip-flop field evaluated at z = 0 stores a wealth of information about the
dynamical history of the dark matter web. In particular one of the most
intriguing properties of the flip-flop is a unique capability to preserve the
information about the merging history of dark matter haloes.

late-type stars can be retrieved purely from colors using standard photometric
systems. We carried out numerical experiments using stellar fluxes from model
atmospheres, injecting random noise before analyzing them. We examined the
presence of degeneracies among atmospheric parameters, and evaluated how well
the parameters are extracted depending on the number and wavelength span of the
photometric filters available, from the UV GALEX to the mid-IR WISE passbands.
We also considered spectrophotometry from the Gaia mission. We find that
stellar effective temperatures can be determined accurately ($\sigma \sim$ 0.01
dex or about 150 K) when reddening is negligible or known, based merely on
optical photometry, and the accuracy can be improved twofold by including IR
data. On the other hand, stellar metallicities and surface gravities are fairly
unconstrained from optical or IR photometryy. However, our ability to retrieve
these parameters can improve significantly by adding UV photometry. When
reddening is considered a free parameter, assuming it can be modeled perfectly,
our experiments suggest that it can be disentangled from the rest of the
parameters. This theoretical study indicates that combining broad-band
photometry from the UV to the mid-IR allows atmospheric parameters and
interstellar extinction to be determined with fair accuracy. The use of UV
passbands helps substantially to derive metallicities and surface gravities, as
well as to break the degeneracy between effective temperature and reddening.
The Gaia BP/RP data can disentangle all the parameters, provided the stellar
SEDs are modeled reasonably well.

  Electron and ion dynamics, particle abundances and the ambient plasma
conditions in solar flares can be understood by examining hard X-ray (HXR) and
gamma-ray emission (20 keV to 10 MeV) with enhanced imaging, spectroscopy and
polarimetry. GRIPS is specifically designed to answer questions including: What
causes the spatial separation between energetic electrons producing HXRs and
energetic ions producing gamma-ray lines? How anisotropic are the relativistic
electrons, and why can they dominate in the corona? How do the compositions of
accelerated and ambient material vary with space and time, and why?
  GRIPS's key technological improvements over the Reuven Ramaty High Energy
Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) include 3D position-sensitive germanium
detectors (3D-GeDs) and a single-grid, multi-pitch rotating modulator (MPRM)
collimator. The 3D-GeDs have spectral FWHM resolution of a few hundred keV and
spatial resolution $<$1 mm$^3$. For photons that Compton scatter, usually
$\gtrsim$150 keV, the energy deposition sites can be tracked, providing
polarization measurements as well as enhanced background reduction. The MPRM
single-grid design provides twice the throughput of a bi-grid imaging system
like RHESSI. The grid is composed of 2.5 cm thick W/Cu slats with 1-13 mm
variable slit pitch, achieving quasi-continuous FWHM angular coverage over
12.5-162 arcsecs. This resolution is capable of imaging the separate magnetic

separability probability, $P(k,\alpha)$, for generalized (real, complex,
quaternionic,\ldots) two-qubit states endowed with random induced measure, for
which the determinantal inequality $|\rho^{PT}| >|\rho|$ holds. Here $\rho$
denotes a $4 \times 4$ density matrix, obtained by tracing over the pure states
in $4 \times (4 +k)$-dimensions, and $\rho^{PT}$, its partial transpose.
Further, $\alpha$ is a Dyson-index-like parameter with $\alpha = 1$ for the
standard (15-dimensional) convex set of (complex) two-qubit states. For $k=0$,
we obtain the previously reported Hilbert-Schmidt formulas, with (the real
case) $Q(0,\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{29}{128}$, (the standard complex case)
$Q(0,1)=\frac{4}{33}$, and (the quaternionic case) $Q(0,2)=
\frac{13}{323}$---the three simply equalling $ P(0,\alpha)/2$. The factors
$G_2^k(\alpha)$ are sums of polynomial-weighted generalized hypergeometric
functions $_{p}F_{p-1}$, $p \geq 7$, all with argument $z=\frac{27}{64}
=(\frac{3}{4})^3$. We find number-theoretic-based formulas for the upper
($u_{ik}$) and lower ($b_{ik}$) parameter sets of these functions and, then,
equivalently express $G_2^k(\alpha)$ in terms of first-order difference
equations. Applications of Zeilberger's algorithm yield ""concise"" forms,
parallel to the one obtained previously for $P(0,\alpha) =2 Q(0,\alpha)$. For
nonnegative half-integer and integer values of $\alpha$, $Q(k,\alpha)$ has
descending roots starting at $k=-\alpha-1$. Then, we (C. Dunkl and I) construct
a remarkably compact (hypergeometric) form for $Q(k,\alpha)$ itself. The
possibility of an analogous ""master"" formula for $P(k,\alpha)$ is, then,
investigated, and a number of interesting results found.

comfortable interfaces to the scalp that are capable of relaying the
microvolt-level scalp potentials to signal processing electronics. A key
challenge is that most material approaches are sensitive to deformation-induced
shifts in electrical impedance associated with decreased signal-to-noise ratio.
This is a particular concern in real-world environments where human motion is
present. The entire set of brain information outside of tightly controlled
laboratory or clinical settings are currently unobtainable due to this
challenge. Here we explore the performance of an elastomeric material solution
purposefully designed for dry, soft, comfortable scalp contact electrodes for
EEG that is specifically targeted to have flat electrical impedance response to
deformation to enable utilization in real world environments. A conductive
carbon nanofiber filled polydimethylsiloxane (CNF-PDMS) elastomer was evaluated
at three fill ratios (3, 4 and 7 volume percent). To evaluate usability for
EEG, pre-recorded human EEG signals were replayed through the contact
electrodes subjected to quasi-static compressive strains between zero and 35%.
These tests show that conductive filler ratios well above the electrical
percolation threshold are desirable in order to maximize signal-to-noise ratio
and signal correlation with an ideal baseline. Increasing fill ratios yield
increasingly flat electrical impedance response to large applied compressive
deformations with a trade in increased material stiffness, and with nominal
electrical impedance tunable over greater than 4 orders of magnitude.

correlation between the depth of shower maximum and the signal in the water
Cherenkov stations of air-showers registered simultaneously by the fluorescence
and the surface detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Such a correlation
measurement is a unique feature of a hybrid air-shower observatory with
sensitivity to both the electromagnetic and muonic components. It allows an
accurate determination of the spread of primary masses in the cosmic-ray flux.
Up till now, constraints on the spread of primary masses have been dominated by
systematic uncertainties. The present correlation measurement is not affected
by systematics in the measurement of the depth of shower maximum or the signal
in the water Cherenkov stations. The analysis relies on general characteristics
of air showers and is thus robust also with respect to uncertainties in
hadronic event generators. The observed correlation in the energy range around
the `ankle' at $\lg(E/{\rm eV})=18.5-19.0$ differs significantly from
expectations for pure primary cosmic-ray compositions. A light composition made
up of proton and helium only is equally inconsistent with observations. The
data are explained well by a mixed composition including nuclei with mass $A >
4$. Scenarios such as the proton dip model, with almost pure compositions, are
thus disfavoured as the sole explanation of the ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray
flux at Earth.

and ground states of many-body quantum systems. Kitaev applied this

and Aharanov et al. used it to show the equivalence of adiabatic computation
and the quantum circuit model. In this work, we analyze the low energy
properties of a class of modified circuit Hamiltonians, which include features
like complex weights and branching transitions. For history states with linear
clocks and complex weights, we develop a method for modifying the circuit
propagation Hamiltonian to implement any desired distribution over the time
steps of the circuit in a frustration-free ground state, and show that this can
be used to obtain a constant output probability for universal adiabatic
computation while retaining the $\Omega(T^{-2})$ scaling of the spectral gap,
and without any additional overhead in terms of numbers of qubits.
  Furthermore, we establish limits on the increase in the ground energy due to
input and output penalty terms for modified tridiagonal clocks with non-uniform
distributions on the time steps by proving a tight $O(T^{-2})$ upper bound on
the product of the spectral gap and ground state overlap with the endpoints of
the computation. Using variational techniques which go beyond the
$\Omega(T^{-3})$ scaling that follows from the usual geometrical lemma, we
prove that the standard Feynman-Kitaev Hamiltonian already saturates this
bound. We review the formalism of unitary labeled graphs which replace the
usual linear clock by graphs that allow branching and loops, and we extend the
$O(T^{-2})$ bound from linear clocks to this more general setting. In order to
achieve this, we apply Chebyshev polynomials to generalize an upper bound on
the spectral gap in terms of the graph diameter to the context of arbitrary
Hermitian matrices.

an arbitrary number of dedicated processes to drive asynchronous progression.
Further, we describe a prototypical library implementation of our concepts,
namely DART, which is used to quantitatively evaluate our design against a
MPI-3 baseline reference. The evaluation consists of micro-benchmark to measure
overlap of communication and computation and a scientific application kernel to
assess total performance impact on realistic use-cases. Our benchmarks shows,
that our asynchronous progression scheme can overlap computation and
communication efficiently and lead to substantially shorter communication cost

compared to predictions from a quantum dynamical model, where the control is
based on the manipulation of the phases of a vibrational wave packet by the

deprotonation of acetylene is well captured by the model. In the case of the
isomerization of acetylene, however, we find differences in the intensity
dependence between experiment and theory. For the isomerization of allene, an
inversion of the CEP-dependent asymmetry is observed when the intensity is
varied, which we discuss in light of the quantum dynamical model. The inversion
of the asymmetry is found to be consistent with a transition from

main effect stems from gravitational focusing of the flow of Imperfect Dark
Matter passing near the Sun. This entails strong amplification of Imperfect
Dark Matter energy density compared to its average value in the surrounding
halo. The enhancement is many orders of magnitude larger than in the case of
Cold Dark Matter, provoking deviations of the metric in the second order in the

substantially affect the planetary dynamics. Using the existing bound on the

communications, remote sensing and scientific research for both civilian and
military purposes. As individual spacecraft are limited by the size, mass and
power constraints, mass-produced small satellites in large constellations or
clusters could be useful in many science missions such as gravity mapping,
tracking of forest fires, finding water resources, etc. Constellation of
satellites provide improved spatial and temporal resolution of the target.
Small satellite constellations contribute innovative applications by replacing
a single asset with several very capable spacecraft which opens the door to new
applications. With increasing levels of autonomy, there will be a need for
remote communication networks to enable communication between spacecraft. These
space based networks will need to configure and maintain dynamic routes, manage
intermediate nodes, and reconfigure themselves to achieve mission objectives.
Hence, inter-satellite communication is a key aspect when satellites fly in

the small satellite community for implementing inter-satellite communications
based on the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model. This paper also reviews
the various design parameters applicable to the first three layers of the OSI
model, i.e., physical, data link and network layer. Based on the survey, we
also present a comprehensive list of design parameters useful for achieving
inter-satellite communications for multiple small satellite missions. Specific
topics include proposed solutions for some of the challenges faced by small
satellite systems, enabling operations using a network of small satellites, and
some examples of small satellite missions involving formation flying aspects.

the speedup of a task $T_{j}$ is linear when the number $p$ of assigned

monotonicity when $p$ ranges in $[\delta_{j}, k_{j}]$; the bound $k_{j}$
indicates an unacceptable overhead when parallelizing on too many processors.
The generality of this model is proved to be between the classic monotonic and

a result of performing measurements. Indeed, with every quantum measurement one
can associate a number -- its POVM norm constant -- that quantifies how much
the distinguishability of quantum states degrades in the worst case as a result
of the measurement. This raises the obvious question which measurements
preserve the most information in these sense of having the largest norm
constant. While a number of near-optimal schemes have been found (e.g. the
uniform POVM, or complex projective 4-designs), they all seem to be difficult
to implement in practice. Here, we analyze the distinguishability of quantum
states under measurements that are orbits of the Clifford group. The Clifford
group plays an important role e.g. in quantum error correction, and its
elements are considered simple to implement. We find that the POVM norm
constants of Clifford orbits depend on the effective rank of the states that
should be distinguished, as well as on a quantitative measure of the ""degree of
localization in phase space"" of the vectors in the orbit. The most important
Clifford orbit is formed by the set of stabilizer states. Our main result
implies that stabilizer measurements are essentially optimal for distinguishing
pure quantum states. As an auxiliary result, we use the methods developed here
to prove new entropic uncertainty relations for stabilizer measurements. This
paper is based on a very recent analysis of the representation theory of tensor
powers of the Clifford group.

a first-order Fermi process. In this work we analyse the acceleration rate and
the energy distribution of test particles injected in three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) domains with large-scale current sheets where
reconnection is made fast by the presence of turbulence. We study the
dependence of the particle acceleration time with the relevant parameters of
the embedded turbulence, i.e., the Alfv\'en speed $V_{\rm A}$, the injection
power $P_{\rm inj}$ and scale $k_{\rm inj}$ ($k_{\rm inj} = 1/l_{\rm inj}$). We
find that the acceleration time follows a power-law dependence with the
particle kinetic energy: $t_{acc} \propto E^{\alpha}$, with $0.2 < \alpha <
0.6$ for a vast range of values of $c / V_{\rm A} \sim 20 - 1000$. The
acceleration time decreases with the Alfv\'en speed (and therefore with the
reconnection velocity) as expected, having an approximate dependence $t_{acc}
\propto (V_{\rm A} / c)^{-\kappa}$, with $\kappa \sim 2.1- 2.4$ for particles
reaching kinetic energies between $1 - 100 \, m_p c^2$, respectively.
Furthermore, we find that the acceleration time is only weakly dependent on the
$P_{\rm inj}$ and $l_{\rm inj}$ parameters of the turbulence. The particle
spectrum develops a high-energy tail which can be fitted by a hard power-law
already in the early times of the acceleration, in consistency with the results
of kinetic studies of particle acceleration by magnetic reconnection in
collisionless plasmas.

are usually thought to be only possible in conjunction with the higher

symmetries are allowed to act in a nonlocal fashion. An example is the
particle-hole symmetric half filled Landau level, which effectively realizes
the anomalous surface state of a 3D chiral Topological Insulator (class AIII).
A dual description in terms of Dirac composite fermions has also been
discussed. Here we explore generalizations of these constructions to
multicomponent quantum Hall states. Our results include a duality mapping of
the bilayer case to composite bosons with Kramers degeneracy and the
possibility of a particle hole symmetric integer quantum Hall state when the
number of components is a multiple of eight. Next, we make a further extension
by half filling other classes of topological bands and imposing particle hole
symmetry. When applied to time-reversal invariant topological insulators we
realize a different chiral class (CII) topological surface state. Notably,
half-filling a 3D TI band allows for the realization of the surface of the
otherwise inaccessible 4D topological insulator, which supports an anomalous 3D
Dirac cone. Surface topological orders equivalent to the 3D Dirac cone (from
the global anomaly standpoint) are constructed and connections to Witten's
SU(2) anomaly are made. These observations may also be useful for numerical

estimates of photometric redshifts. In the framework of the implementation of
the photo-z algorithm for Euclid, we are exploring new avenues to improve
template-fitting methods. The paper focusses on the prescription of the
extinction of source light by dust in the Milky Way. Since Galactic extinction
strongly correlates with wavelength and photometry is commonly obtained in
broad-band filters, the amount of absorption depends on the source SED, a point
often neglected as the SED is not known a-priori. A consequence of this is that
the observed E(B-V) (=A_B-A_V) will be different from the E(B-V) used to
normalise the absorption law k_lambda (=A_lambda/E(B-V)). Band-pass corrections
are required to renormalise the law for a given SED. We assess the band-pass
corrections of a range of SEDs and find they vary by up to 20%. We investigate
how dust-to-reddening scaling factors depend of the sources used for their
calibration. We derive scaling factors from the color excesses of z<0.4 SDSS
red galaxies and show that band-pass corrections predict the observed
differences. Extinction is then estimated for a range of SEDs and filters
relevant to Euclid and other cosmological ground-based surveys. For high
extinction line-of-sights (E(B-V)>0.1, ~8% of the Euclid survey), the
variations in corrections can be ~0.1mag in the `bluer' optical filters and
~0.04mag in the NIR filters. An inaccurate correction of extinction critically
affects photo-z. In particular, for high extinctions and z<0.5, the bias (mean
D_z=z_phot-z_real) exceeds 0.2%(1+z), the precision required by weak-lensing
analyses. Additional uncertainty on the MW extinction law further reduces the
photo-z precision. We propose a new prescription of Galactic absorption for
template-fitting algorithms that takes into consideration the dependence of
extinction with SED.

densities far below CDM predictions. When a disk potential is present, the
inner SIDM halo becomes \em{more flattened} in the disk plane than the CDM
halo. These results are in excellent quantitative agreement with the
predictions of Kaplinghat et al. (2014). We also simulated a galaxy cluster
halo with a central stellar distribution similar to the brightest central
galaxy of the cluster A2667. A SIDM halo simulated with cross section over mass
$\sigma/m = 0.1\ \mathrm{cm^2 g^{-1}}$ provides a good match to the measured
dark matter density profile of A2667, while an adiabatically-contracted CDM
halo is denser and cuspier. The cored profile of the same halo simulated with
$\sigma/m = 0.5\ \mathrm{cm^2 g^{-1}}$ is not dense enough to match A2667. Our
findings are in agreement with previous results that $\sigma/m \gtrsim 0.1\
\mathrm{cm^2 g^{-1}}$ is disfavored for dark matter collision velocities in
excess of about 1500 km/s. More generally, the predictive cross-talk between
baryonic potentials and SIDM density distributions offers new directions for
constraining SIDM cross sections in massive galaxies where baryons are
dynamically important.

geometry of momentum twistor Grassmannian for planar N=4 SYM scattering
amplitudes. First we establish the fundamentals of positive Grassmannian
geometry for tree amplitudes. Then we formulate this subject around these four
major facets: 1. Deriving the tree and 1-loop BCFW recursion relations solely
from positivity, after introducing the simple building blocks called positive
components. 2. Applying Grassmannian geometry and Pluecker coordinates to
determine the signs in N$^2$MHV homological identities. Most of them in fact
reflect the secret incarnation of the simple 6-term NMHV identity. 3. Deriving
the stacking positivity relation, which is powerful for parameterizing the
matrix representative in terms of positive variables, of a given Grassmannian
geometric configuration. 4. Introducing a highly refined formalism for tree
BCFW recursion relation, which reveals its two-fold simplex-like structures.
First, the BCFW contour in terms of (reduced) Grassmannian geometry
representatives is dissected into a triangle-shape sum, as only a small
fraction of the sum needs to be explicitly identified. Second, this fraction
can be further dissected, according to different growing modes and parameters.
The growing modes possess the shapes of solid simplices of various dimensions,
with which infinite number of BCFW cells can be entirely captured by the
characteristic objects called fully-spanning cells. We find that for a given k,
beyond n=4k+1 there is no more new fully-spanning cell, which signifies the
essential termination of the recursive growth of BCFW cells. As n increases
beyond the termination point, the BCFW contour simply replicates itself
according to the simplex-like patterns, which enables us to master all BCFW
cells once for all without actually identifying most of them.

what further analyses should become routine, so as to test as-yet-unknown

invoke screening mechanisms which can imprint a non-standard density dependence

provides a density-dependent statistic which is easy to compute and report and
requires minimal additional infrastructure beyond what is routinely available

using low order perturbation theory. We encourage groups developing modified

developed into the widely accepted theory of planet formation. Surprisingly,
the first several hundred extrasolar planets (mostly Jovian) discovered using
the Radial Velocity (RV) technique are commonly on eccentric orbits (<e> ~
0.3). This raises a fundamental question: Are the Solar System and its
formation special? The Kepler mission has found thousands of transiting planets
dominated by sub-Neptunes, but most of their orbital eccentricities remain
unknown. By using the precise spectroscopic host star parameters from the
LAMOST observations, we measure the eccentricity distributions for a large
(698) and homogeneous Kepler planet sample with transit duration statistics.
Nearly half of the planets are in systems with single transiting planets
(singles), while the other half are multiple-transiting planets (multiples). We
find an eccentricity dichotomy: on average, Kepler singles are on eccentric
orbits with <e>~0.3, while the multiples are on nearly circular (<e> =

shown that a large portion of exoplanets detected by the Kepler mission have
been significantly eroded by photo-evaporation. In this paper, we numerically
study the effects of photo-evaporation on the orbital evolution of a
hypothesized moon system around a planet. We find that photo-evaporation is
crucial to the stability of the moon system. Photo-evaporation can erode the
atmosphere of the planet thus leading to significant mass loss. As the planet
loses mass, its Hill radius shrinks and its moons increase their orbital
semi-major axes and eccentricities. When some moons approach their critical
semi-major axes, global instability of the moon system would be triggered,
which usually ends up with two, one or even zero surviving moons. Some lost
moons could escape from the moon system to become a new planet orbiting the
star or run away further to become a free-floating object in the Galaxy. Given
the destructive role of photo-evaporation, we speculate that exo-moons are less
common for close-in planets ($<0.1$ AU), especially those around M-type stars,
because they are more X-ray luminous and thus enhancing photo-evaporation. The
lessons we learn in this study may be helpful for the target selection of
on-going/future exomoon searching programs.

that in-situ formation of the four circumbinary moons is extremely difficult if
Charon undergoes eccentric tidal evolution. We track collisions of disc debris
with Charon, estimating that hundreds to hundreds of thousands of visible

a dearth of these small craters may place constraints on the disc properties.
While tidal heating will erase some of the cratering history, both tidal and

craters from Kuiper belt object craters. We also track the debris ejected from
the Pluto-Charon system into the Solar System; while most of this debris is
ultimately lost from the Solar System, a few tens of 10--30 km radius bodies

feature, namely, there are small but significant deficits/excesses of planet
pairs with orbital period spacing slightly narrow/wide of the exact resonance,
particularly near the first order mean motion resonance (MMR), such as 2:1 and
3:2 MMR. Similarly, if not exactly the same, an asymmetric feature (pileup wide
of 2:1 MMR) is also seen in RV planets, but only for massive ones. We
analytically and numerically study planets' orbital evolutions near and in the
MMR. We find that their orbital period ratios could be asymmetrically
distributed around the MMR center regardless of dissipation. In the case of no
dissipation, Kepler planets' asymmetric orbital distribution could be partly
reproduced for 3:2 MMR but not for 2:1 MMR, implying that dissipation might be
more important to the latter. The pileup of massive RV planets just wide of 2:1
MMR is found to be consistent with the scenario that planets formed separately

1-100 on the order of magnitude for massive planets, where K is the damping

and in star-forming regions in galaxies. Modelling this interaction provides
information on dust in galaxies, a vital ingredient for their evolution. It is
not straightforward to identify the stellar populations heating the dust, and
to link attenuation to emission on a sub-galactic scale. Radiative transfer
models are able to simulate this dust-starlight interaction in a realistic,
three-dimensional setting. We investigate the dust heating mechanisms on a
local and global galactic scale, using the Andromeda galaxy (M31) as our
laboratory. We perform a series of panchromatic radiative transfer simulations
of Andromeda with our code SKIRT. The high inclination angle of M31 complicates
the 3D modelling and causes projection effects. However, the observed
morphology and flux density are reproduced fairly well from UV to
sub-millimeter wavelengths. Our model reveals a realistic attenuation curve,
compatible with previous, observational estimates. We find that the dust in M31
is mainly (91 % of the absorbed luminosity) heated by the evolved stellar
populations. The bright bulge produces a strong radiation field and induces
non-local heating up to the main star-forming ring at 10 kpc. The relative
contribution of unevolved stellar populations to the dust heating varies
strongly with wavelength and with galactocentric distance.The dust heating
fraction of unevolved stellar populations correlates strongly with NUV-r colour
and specific star formation rate. These two related parameters are promising
probes for the dust heating sources at a local scale.

dark matter (SFDM) model, which assumes dark matter is a spin-0 ultra-light
scalar field (SF) with a typical mass $m\sim10^{-22}\mathrm{eV}/c^2$ and
positive self-interactions. Due to the ultra-light boson mass, the SFDM could
form Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in the very early Universe, which are
interpreted as the dark matter haloes. Although cosmologically the model
behaves as CDM, they differ at small scales: SFDM naturally predicts fewer
satellite haloes, cores in dwarf galaxies and the formation of massive galaxies
at high redshifts. The ground state (or BEC) solution at zero temperature
suffices to describe low-mass galaxies but fails for larger systems. A possible
solution is adding finite-temperature corrections to the SF potential which
allows combinations of excited states. In this work, we test the
finite-temperature multistate SFDM solution at galaxy cluster scales and
compare our results with the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and BEC profiles. We
achieve this by fitting the mass distribution of 13 \textit{Chandra} X-ray
clusters of galaxies, excluding the region of the brightest cluster galaxy. We
show that the SFDM model accurately describes the clusters' DM mass
distributions offering an equivalent or better agreement than the NFW profile.
The complete disagreement of the BEC model with the data is also shown. We
conclude that the theoretically motivated multistate SFDM profile is an
interesting alternative to empirical profiles and ad hoc fitting-functions that
attempt to couple the asymptotic NFW decline with the inner core in SFDM.

passes through a shock front before being accreted into a protoplanet, the
entropy can be substantially altered. To investigate this, we present high
resolution, 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations of accreting giant planets.
The accreted gas is found to fall with supersonic speed in the gap from the
circumstellar disk's upper layers onto the surface of the circumplanetary disk
and polar region of the protoplanet. There it shocks, creating an extended hot
supercritical shock surface. This shock front is optically thick, therefore, it
can conceal the planet's intrinsic luminosity beneath. The gas in the vertical
influx has high entropy which when passing through the shock front decreases
significantly while the gas becomes part of the disk and protoplanet. This
shows that circumplanetary disks play a key role in regulating a planet's
thermodynamic state. Our simulations furthermore indicate that around the shock
surface extended regions of atomic - sometimes ionized - hydrogen develop.
Therefore circumplanetary disk shock surfaces could influence significantly the
observational appearance of forming gas-giants.

find that the nGC3 method has a well-defined detection boundary in the space of
stream width and projected overdensity, that can be predicted based on direct
observables alone. We predict that about 4-13 dwarf galaxy streams can be
detected in a typical Milky Way-mass halo with Gaia+nGC3, with an estimated
efficiency of $>$80\% inside the detection boundary. The progenitors of these

equilibrium' with their surrounding accretion flows, which requires that the
accretion rate changes more slowly than it takes the star to reach spin
equilibrium. This is not true for most magnetically accreting stars, which have
strongly variable accretion outbursts on time-scales much shorter than the time
it would take to reach spin equilibrium. This paper examines how accretion
outbursts affect the time a star takes to reach spin equilibrium and its final
equilibrium spin period. I consider several different models for angular
momentum loss -- either carried away in an outflow, lost to a stellar wind, or
transferred back to the accretion disc (the `trapped disc'). For transient
sources, the outflow scenario leads to significantly longer times to reach spin
equilibrium ($\sim$10x), and shorter equilibrium spin periods than would be
expected from spin equilibrium arguments, while the `trapped disc' does not.
The results suggest that disc trapping plays a significant role in the spin
evolution of strongly magnetic stars, with some caveats for young stellar
objects.

synchronization relaxation for closed-loop signaling overhead reduction in some
5G applications. These severe impairments induce a strong loss of orthogonality
between subcarriers and OFDM symbols and, therefore, lead to a dramatic
increase in ICI and ISI. To be well armed against these dramatic impairments,
we, in the present paper, optimize the transmit/receive waveforms for FBMC
systems, with hexagonal time-frequency lattices, operating over severe doubly
dispersive channels, accounting for both natural and artificial impairments.
For this, we exploit the POPS paradigm, recently proposed for rectangular
time-frequency lattices, to design offline waveforms maximizing the SINR for
hexagonal time-frequency lattices. We show that FBMC, with hexagonal lattices,
offers a strong improvement in SIR with respect to conventional OFDM and an
improvement of 1dB with respect to POPS-FBMC, with classical rectangular
lattices. Furthermore, we show that the hexagonal POPS-FBMC brings more
robustness to frequency synchronization errors and offers a 10dB reduction in

of isolated and merging galaxies, to investigate how well the simulations
reproduce our empirical IR AGN fraction estimates and determine how IR AGN
fractions relate to the UV-mm AGN fraction. We find that: 1) IR AGN fraction
estimates based on simulations are in qualitative agreement with the empirical
values when host reprocessing of the AGN light is considered; 2) for
star-forming galaxy-AGN composites our empirical methods may be underestimating
the role of AGN, as our simulations imply $>$50% AGN fractions, $\sim$3$\times$
higher than previous estimates; 3) 6% of our empirically classified ""SFG"" have
AGN fractions $\gtrsim$50%. While this is a small percentage of SFGs, if
confirmed, would imply the true number density of AGN may be underestimated; 4)
this comparison depends on the adopted AGN template -- those that neglect the
contribution of warm dust lower the empirical fractions by up to 2$\times$; and
5) the IR AGN fraction is only a good proxy for the intrinsic UV-mm AGN

  Formulations and Asymptotics",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A large class of stochastic programs involve optimizing an expectation taken
with respect to an underlying distribution that is unknown in practice. One
popular approach to addressing the distributional uncertainty, known as the
distributionally robust optimization (DRO), is to hedge against the worst case
over an uncertainty set of candidate distributions. However, it has been
observed that inappropriate construction of the uncertainty set can sometimes
result in over-conservative solutions. To explore the middle ground between
optimistically ignoring the distributional uncertainty and pessimistically
fixating on the worst-case scenario, we propose a Bayesian risk optimization
(BRO) framework for parametric underlying distributions, which is to optimize a
risk functional applied to the posterior distribution of an unknown
distribution parameter. Of our particular interest are four risk functionals:
mean, mean-variance, value-at-risk, and conditional value-at-risk. To unravel
the implication of BRO, we establish the consistency of objective functions and
optimal solutions, as well as the asymptotic normality of objective functions
and optimal values. More importantly, our analysis reveals a hidden
interpretation: the objectives of BRO can be approximately viewed as a weighted
sum of posterior mean objective and the (squared) half-width of the true
objective's confidence interval.

The success of transport based distances is in part due to their Lagrangian
nature which allows it to capture the important variations in many signal
classes. However these distances require the signal to be nonnegative and
normalized. Furthermore, the signals are considered as measures and compared by
redistributing (transporting) them, which does not directly take into account
the signal intensity. Here we study a transport-based distance, called the
$TL^p$ distance, that combines Lagrangian and intensity modelling and is
directly applicable to general, non-positive and multi-channelled signals. The

provided unique insights into the acceleration process. Among those objects,
RX$~$J1713.7-3946 (also known as G347.3-0.5) has the largest surface
brightness, allowing us in the past to perform the most comprehensive study of
morphology and spatially resolved spectra of any such very-high-energy

RX$~$J1713.7-3946, almost doubling the observation time compared to our
previous publication. Combined with new improved analysis tools, the previous
sensitivity is more than doubled. The H.E.S.S. angular resolution of
$0.048^\circ$ ($0.036^\circ$ above 2 TeV) is unprecedented in gamma-ray
astronomy and probes physical scales of 0.8 (0.6) parsec at the remnant's
location.
  The new H.E.S.S. image of RX$~$J1713.7-3946 allows us to reveal clear
morphological differences between X-rays and gamma rays. In particular, for the
outer edge of the brightest shell region, we find the first ever indication for
particles in the process of leaving the acceleration shock region. By studying
the broadband energy spectrum, we furthermore extract properties of the parent
particle populations, providing new input to the discussion of the leptonic or
hadronic nature of the gamma-ray emission mechanism.

previously unreported fingering instability, where fingers pinch off from an
unstable front to form autonomous ""critters"", whose size is selected by the
height of the particles above the floor. These critters are a stable state of
the system, move much faster than individual particles, and quickly respond to
a changing drive. With speed and direction set by a rotating magnetic field,
these active structures offer interesting possibilities for guided transport,

Surprisingly, this passive mechanism is also accompanied by a chiral reduction
in heat load leading to optical cooling of the mechanics without added damping,
an effect that has no optical analogue. This technique can potentially improve
upon the fundamental thermal limits of resonant mechanical sensors, which

It separates a data matrix into a low-rank part and a sparse part. The convex
approach has been well studied in the literature. However, state-of-the-art
algorithms for the convex approach usually have relatively high complexity due
to the need of solving (partial) singular value decompositions of large
matrices. A non-convex approach, AltProj, has also been proposed with lighter
complexity and better scalability. Given the true rank $r$ of the underlying
low rank matrix, AltProj has a complexity of $O(r^2dn)$, where $d\times n$ is
the size of data matrix. In this paper, we propose a novel factorization-based
model of RPCA, which has a complexity of $O(kdn)$, where $k$ is an upper bound

From extensive experiments, we observe that AltProj can work only when $r$ is
precisely known in advance; however, when the needed rank parameter $r$ is
specified to a value different from the true rank, AltProj cannot fully
separate the two parts while our method succeeds. Even when both work, our
method is about 4 times faster than AltProj. Our method can be used as a

physics, ranging from cosmology and particle physics to condensed matter. A
prime example is the breaking of spatial translation symmetry, which underlies

Analogous to crystals in space, the breaking of translation symmetry in time
and the emergence of a ""time crystal"" was recently proposed, but later shown to
be forbidden in thermal equilibrium. However, non-equilibrium Floquet systems
subject to a periodic drive can exhibit persistent time-correlations at an
emergent sub-harmonic frequency. This new phase of matter has been dubbed a
""discrete time crystal"" (DTC). Here, we present the first experimental
observation of a discrete time crystal, in an interacting spin chain of trapped
atomic ions. We apply a periodic Hamiltonian to the system under many-body

that is robust to external perturbations. Such a time crystal opens the door
for studying systems with long-range spatial-temporal correlations and novel

algorithms use some form of a least-squares noise minimization to find
exoplanets that are, before post-processing, often hidden below the
instrumental speckle noise. In the current standard PSF subtraction algorithms,
a set of reference images is derived from the target image sequence to subtract
each target image, using Angular and/or Simultaneous Spectral Differential
Imaging (ADI, SSDI, respectively). However, to avoid excessive exoplanet
self-subtraction, ADI and SSDI (in the absence of a strong spectral feature)
severely limit the available number of reference images at small separations.
This limits the performance of the least-squares algorithm, resulting in lower
sensitivity to exoplanets at small angular separations. Possible solutions are
to use additional reference images by acquiring longer sequences, use SSDI if
the exoplanet is expected to show strong spectral features, or use images
acquired on other targets. The latter option, known as Reference Star
Differential Imaging (RSDI), which relies on the use of reference images that
are highly correlated to the target image, has been ineffective in previous
ground-based high contrast imaging surveys. We present the results of work to
optimize PSF subtraction with the GPIES reference library using a least-squares
algorithm designed to minimize speckle noise and maximize planet throughput,
thus maximizing the planet signal to noise ratio (SNR). Using December 2014 51
Eri GPI data in the inner 100 mas to 300 mas annulus, we find no apparent
improvement in SNR when using RSDI and/or our optimization scheme. This result,
while still being investigated, seems to show that current algorithms on
ADI+SSDI data sets are optimized, and that limited gains can be achieved by

states having definite number parity yet not necessarily a fixed particle

edge orientation, fourfold vertices can become stable, as is observed in some
biological systems. More generally, our formulation of vertex stability leads
to an improved treatment of T1 transitions in simulations and paves the way for
studies of more biologically realistic models that couple topological

achieving these high quality factors. Furthermore, we extract the loss limited
by the material absorption in our films to be 0.13 dB/m, which corresponds to
an absorption limited Q of at least 170 million by comparing two resonators

fluctuate over a broad range of temporal and spatial scales. However, commonly
used aeolian transport models do not explicitly account for such fluctuations,
likely contributing to substantial discrepancies between models and
measurements. Underlying this problem is the absence of accurate sand flux
measurements at the short time scales at which wind speed fluctuates. Here, we
draw on extensive field measurements of aeolian saltation to develop a
methodology for generating high-frequency (25 Hz) time series of total
(vertically-integrated) saltation flux, namely by calibrating high-frequency
(HF) particle counts to low-frequency (LF) flux measurements. The methodology
follows four steps: (1) fit exponential curves to vertical profiles of
saltation flux from LF saltation traps, (2) determine empirical calibration
factors through comparison of LF exponential fits to HF number counts over
concurrent time intervals, (3) apply these calibration factors to subsamples of
the saltation count time series to obtain HF height-specific saltation fluxes,
and (4) aggregate the calibrated HF height-specific saltation fluxes into
estimates of total saltation fluxes. When coupled to high-frequency
measurements of wind velocity, this methodology offers new opportunities for
understanding how aeolian saltation dynamics respond to variability in driving
winds over time scales from tens of milliseconds to days.

mean variability of the entire VVV sample. The light curves of these objects
sampled between 2010-2015 display rising, declining, or quasi-periodic

The yellow cabs that are ubiquitous in Manhattan are as iconic as the city's

to improve taxi service in areas outside of the central business districts and
airports. Approximately 500,000 taxi trips are taken daily, carrying about
800,000 passengers, and not including other livery firms such as Uber, Lyft or
Carmel. Since 2008 yellow taxis have been able to process fare payments with
credit cards, and credits cards are a growing share of total fare payments.
However, the use of credit cards to pay for taxi fares varies widely across
neighborhoods, and there are strong correlations between cash payments for taxi
fares and the presence of unbanked or underbanked populations. These issues are
of concern for policymakers as approximately ten percent of households in the
city are unbanked, and in some neighborhoods the share of unbanked households
is over 50 percent. In this paper we use multiple datasets to explore taxicab
fare payments by neighborhood and examine how access to taxicab services is
associated with use of conventional banking services. There is a clear spatial
dimension to the propensity of riders to pay cash, and we find that both
immigrant status and being 'unbanked' are strong predictors of cash
transactions for taxicabs. These results have implications for local
regulations of the for-hire vehicle industry, particularly in the context of
the rapid growth of services that require credit cards. Without some type of
cash-based payment option taxi services will isolate certain neighborhoods. At
the very least, existing and new providers of transit services must consider
access to mainstream financial products as part of their equity analyses.

and a much higher false-negative rate of 20-40%, likely caused by the very high
flare rate of Proxima Centauri. Comparing our candidate signal to HATSouth
ground-based photometry reveals that the signal is somewhat, but not
conclusively, disfavored (1-2 sigmas) leading us to argue that the signal is
most likely spurious. We expect that infrared photometric follow-up could more
conclusively test the existence of this candidate signal, owing to the
suppression of flare activity and the impressive infrared brightness of the
parent star.

graph enables the minimum-cut size of the original graph to be obtained for any
pair of vertices. Cut trees are a powerful back-end for graph management and
mining, as they support various procedures related to the minimum cut, maximum
flow, and connectivity. However, the crucial drawback with cut trees is the
computational cost of their construction. In theory, a cut tree is built by
applying a maximum flow algorithm for $n$ times, where $n$ is the number of
vertices. Therefore, naive implementations of this approach result in cubic
time complexity, which is obviously too slow for today's large-scale graphs. To
address this issue, in the present study, we propose a new cut-tree
construction algorithm tailored to real-world networks. Using a series of
experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is several orders of
magnitude faster than previous algorithms and it can construct cut trees for
billion-scale graphs.

optical light curves over 8 years are collected from the Catalina Sky Surveys

describe the long-term variability of the double-peaked emitters. Meanwhile,
the same DRW process is applied to long-term optical light curves of more than
7000 spectroscopically confirmed normal quasars in the SDSS Stripe82 Database.
Then, we can find that the DRW process determined rest-frame intrinsic
variability timescales $\ln(\tau/{\rm days})$ are about 5.8 and about 4.8 for
the double-peaked emitters and for the normal quasars, respectively. The
statistically longer intrinsic variability timescales can be confirmed in the
double-peaked emitters, after considerations of necessary effects, such as the
effects from different distributions of redshift, BH mass and accretion rate
between the double-peaked emitters and the normal quasars. Moreover, a radial
dependence of accretion rate $\dot{m}_{\rm R}~\propto~R^\beta$ with larger
values of $\beta$ could be an acceptable interpretation of the longer intrinsic
variability timescales in the double-peaked emitters. Therefore, there are
different intrinsic properties of emission regions between the double-peaked

into multiple tiles while encoding and packaging, use MPEG-DASH SRD to describe
the spatial relationship of tiles in the 360-degree space, and prioritize the
tiles in the Field of View (FoV). In order to describe such tiled

spatially partition the underlying 3D mesh, and construct an efficient 3D

Release 7 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, focusing on the $1350$ \AA \ $\leq

lines from \SiIV, O IV], \CIV, \CIII, and \MgII\ species. We use principal
component analysis to determine the dominant components of spectral variation,
as well as to quantitatively measure spectral similarity. As suggested by both
the Baldwin effect and modified Baldwin effect, quasars with similar spectra
have similar properties: bolometric luminosity, Eddington fraction, and black
hole mass. The latter two quantities are calculated from the luminosity in
conjunction with spectral features, and the variation between quasars with
virtually identical spectra (which we call doppelg\""angers) is driven by the
variance in the luminosity plus measurement uncertainties. In the doppelgangers
the luminosity differences show 1$\sigma$ uncertainties of 57\% (or 0.63
magnitudes) and $\sim$70\% 1$\sigma$ uncertainties for mass and Eddington
fraction. Much of the difference in luminosities may be attributable to time
lags between the spectral lines and the continuum. Furthermore, we find that
suggestions that the mostly highly accreting quasars should be better standard
candles than other quasars are not bourne out for doppelgangers. Finally, we
discuss the implications for using quasars as cosmological probes and the

$M$ and a $d$-dimensional query $q$, the goal is to compute a $k$-sparse
$n$-dimensional vector $\tau$ such that the error $||M \tau-q||$ is minimized.
This problem is equivalent to the following geometric problem: given a set $P$
of $n$ points and a query point $q$ in $d$ dimensions, find the closest
$k$-dimensional subspace to $q$, that is spanned by a subset of $k$ points in
$P$. In this paper, we present data-structures/algorithms and conditional lower
bounds for several variants of this problem (such as finding the closest
induced $k$ dimensional flat/simplex instead of a subspace).
  In particular, we present approximation algorithms for the online variants of
the above problems with query time $\tilde O(n^{k-1})$, which are of interest
in the ""low sparsity regime"" where $k$ is small, e.g., $2$ or $3$. For $k=d$,
this matches, up to polylogarithmic factors, the lower bound that relies on the
affinely degenerate conjecture (i.e., deciding if $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$
contains $d+1$ points contained in a hyperplane takes $\Omega(n^d)$ time).
Moreover, our algorithms involve formulating and solving several geometric
subproblems, which we believe to be of independent interest.

distance, and it has received a broad attention due to its low storage cost and
fast retrieval speed. However, the existing limitations make the present
algorithms difficult to deal with large-scale datasets: (1) discrete
constraints are involved in the learning of the hash function; (2) pairwise or
triplet similarity is adopted to generate efficient hashcodes, resulting both
time and space complexity are greater than O(n^2). To address these issues, we
propose a novel discrete supervised hash learning framework which can be
scalable to large-scale datasets. First, the discrete learning procedure is
decomposed into a binary classifier learning scheme and binary codes learning
scheme, which makes the learning procedure more efficient. Second, we adopt the
Asymmetric Low-rank Matrix Factorization and propose the Fast Clustering-based
Batch Coordinate Descent method, such that the time and space complexity is
reduced to O(n). The proposed framework also provides a flexible paradigm to
incorporate with arbitrary hash function, including deep neural networks and
kernel methods. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method is superior or comparable with state-of-the-art hashing
algorithms.

been extensively used for remote sensing, object identification and imaging. It
has recently been demonstrated that intensity fluctuations give rise to the
formation of correlations in the orbital angular momentum components and
angular positions of random light. Here, we demonstrate that the spatial
signatures and phase information of an object, with rotational symmetries, can
be identified using classical orbital angular momentum correlations in random
light. The Fourier components imprinted in the digital spiral spectrum of the
object, measured through intensity correlations, unveil its spatial and phase
information. Sharing similarities with conventional compressive sensing
protocols that exploit sparsity to reduce the number of measurements required
to reconstruct a signal, our technique allows sensing of an object with fewer
measurements than other schemes that use pixel-by-pixel imaging. One remarkable
advantage of our technique is the fact that it does not require the preparation
of fragile quantum states of light and works at both low- and high-light
levels. In addition, our technique is robust against environmental noise, a
fundamental feature of any realistic scheme for remote sensing.

ultra-compact radio sources with $0.0035<z<3.787$, we describe a method of
identifying the sub-sample which can serve as individual standard rulers in
cosmology. If the linear size of the compact structure is assumed to depend on
source luminosity and redshift as $l_m=l L^\beta (1+z)^n$, only
intermediate-luminosity quasars ($10^{27}$ W/Hz$<L<$ $10^{28}$ W/Hz) show
negligible dependence ($|n|\simeq 10^{-3}$, $|\beta|\simeq 10^{-4}$), and thus
represent a population of such rulers with fixed characteristic length
$l=11.42$ pc. With a sample of 120 such sources covering the redshift range
$0.46<z<2.80$, we confirm the existence of dark energy in the Universe with
high significance under the assumption of a flat universe, and obtain stringent
constraints on both the matter density $\Omega_m=0.323^{+0.245}_{-0.145}$ and
the Hubble constant $H_0=66.30^{+7.00}_{-8.50}$ km sec$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.
Finally, with the angular diameter distances $D_A$ measured for quasars
extending to high redshifts ($z\sim 3.0$), we reconstruct the $D_A(z)$ function
using the technique of Gaussian processes. This allows us to identify the
redshift corresponding to the maximum of the $D_A(z)$ function: $z_m=1.70$ and
the corresponding angular diameter distance $D_A(z_m)=1719.01\pm43.46$ Mpc.
Similar reconstruction of the expansion rate function $H(z)$ based on the data
from cosmic chronometers and BAO gives us $H(z_m)=176.77\pm6.11$ km sec$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$. These measurements are used to estimate the speed of light:
$c=3.039(\pm0.180)\times 10^5$ km/s. This is the first measurement of the speed
of light in a cosmological setting referring to the distant past.

the Sahara 97096 EH3 enstatite chondrite have been studied by backscattered
electron microscopy and electron microprobe in order to investigate the role of
gas-melt interactions in the chondrule sulfide formation. Troilite (FeS) is
systematically present and is the most abundant sulfide within the EH3
chondrite chondrules. It is found either poikilitically enclosed in low-Ca
pyroxenes or scattered within the glassy mesostasis. Oldhamite (CaS) and
niningerite [(Mg,Fe,Mn)S] are present in about 60% of the chondrules studied.
While oldhamite is preferentially present in the mesostasis, niningerite
associated with silica is generally observed in contact with troilite and
low-Ca pyroxene. The chondrule mesostases contain high abundances of alkali and
volatile elements as well as silica. Our data suggest that most of the sulfides
found in EH3 chondrite chondrules are magmatic minerals that formed after the
dissolution of S from a volatile-rich gaseous environment into the molten
chondrules. Troilite formation occurred via sulfur solubility within Fe-poor
chondrule melts followed by sulfide saturation, which causes an immiscible iron
sulfide liquid to separate from the silicate melt. The FeS saturation started
at the same time as or prior to the crystallization of low-Ca pyroxene during
the high temperature chondrule forming event(s). Protracted gas-melt
interactions under high partial pressures of S and SiO led to the formation of
niningerite-silica associations via destabilization of the previously formed
FeS and low-Ca pyroxene. We also propose that formation of the oldhamite
occurred via the sulfide saturation of Fe-poor chondrule melts at moderate S
concentration due to the high degree of polymerization and the high Na-content
of the chondrule melts, which allowed the activity of CaO in the melt to be
enhanced.

dimensional model, which hinders their clinical adoption, has received little
attention. Stable prediction is often overlooked in favour of performance. Yet,
stability prevails as key when adopting models in critical areas as healthcare.
Our study proposes a stabilization scheme by detecting higher order feature
correlations. Using a linear model as basis for prediction, we achieve feature
stability by regularising latent correlation in features. Latent higher order
correlation among features is modelled using an autoencoder network. Stability
is enhanced by combining a recent technique that uses a feature graph, and
augmenting external unlabelled data for training the autoencoder network. Our
experiments are conducted on a heart failure cohort from an Australian
hospital. Stability was measured using Consistency index for feature subsets
and signal-to-noise ratio for model parameters. Our methods demonstrated
significant improvement in feature stability and model estimation stability
when compared to baselines.

provides vessel location data, and GFW uses this information to track global
vessel movement and apply algorithms to classify vessel behavior as ""fishing""

connection can monitor when and where trackable commercial fishing appears to
be occurring around the world. Hundreds of millions of people around the world
depend on our ocean for their livelihoods, and many more rely on it for food.
Collectively, the various applications of GFW will help reduce overfishing and
illegal fishing, restore the ocean's abundance, and ensure sustainability

improving the efficiency of standard video summarization techniques. For this,
we design a deep neural network that maps videos as well as descriptions to a

are placed in a set of bins with limited capacity. Items can be replicated and
placed in any subset of the bins. Each (item, subset) pair has an associated
cost. Not assigning an item to any of the bins is not free in general and can
potentially be the most expensive option. The goal is to minimize the total
cost of assigning items to subsets without exceeding the bin capacities. This
problem is motivated by the design of caching systems composed of banks of
memory with varying cost/performance specifications. The ability to replicate a
data item in more than one memory bank can benefit the overall performance of
the system with a faster recovery time in the event of a memory failure. For
this setting, the number $n$ of data objects (items) is very large and the
number $d$ of memory banks (bins) is a small constant (on the order of $3$ or
$4$). Therefore, the goal is to determine an optimal assignment in time that
minimizes dependence on $n$. The integral version of this problem is NP-hard
since it is a generalization of the knapsack problem. We focus on an efficient
solution to the LP relaxation as the number of fractionally assigned items will
be at most $d$. If the data objects are small with respect to the size of the
memory banks, the effect of excluding the fractionally assigned data items from
the cache will be small. We give an algorithm that solves the LP relaxation and
runs in time $O({3^d \choose d+1} \text{poly}(d) n \log(n) \log(nC) \log(Z))$,

active galactic nucleus NGC 1052. Utilizing the 1 milliarcsecond resolution
achieved by the Korean VLBI Network, we have spatially resolved the HCN
absorption against a double-sided nuclear jet structure. Two velocity features
of HCN absorption are detected significantly at the radial velocity of 1656 and
1719 km/s, redshifted by 149 and 212 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity
of the galaxy. The column density of the HCN molecule is estimated to be
10^{15}-10^{16} cm^{-2}, assuming the excitation temperature of 100-230 K. The
absorption features show high optical depth localized on the receding jet side,
where the free-free absorption occurred due to the circumnuclear torus. The
size of the foreground absorbing molecular gas is estimated to be on
approximately one-parsec scales, which agrees well with the approximate size of
the circumnuclear torus. HCN absorbing gas is likely to be several clumps
smaller than 0.1 parsec inside the circumnuclear torus. The redshifted
velocities of the HCN absorption features imply that HCN absorbing gas traces
ongoing infall motion inside the circumnuclear torus onto the central engine.

using 1.6 {\mu}m and 3.6 {\mu}m selected galaxies in the CANDELS WFC3 catalog.
We detect a stacked flux of ~0.03-0.05 mJy, corresponding to LIR < 10^11 Lsun
and a star formation rate (SFR) of ~ 15 Msun/yr at z = 2. We find that galaxies
brighter in the rest-frame near-infrared tend to be also brighter at 1.1 mm,
and galaxies fainter than m[3.6um] = 23 do not produce detectable 1.1 mm
emission. This suggests a correlation between stellar mass and SFR, but
outliers to this correlation are also observed, suggesting strongly boosted
star formation or extremely large extinction. We also find tendencies that
redder galaxies and galaxies at higher redshifts are brighter at 1.1 mm. Our
field contains z ~ 2.5 H-alpha emitters and a bright single-dish source.
However, we do not find evidence of bias in our results caused by the bright
source. By combining the fluxes of sources detected by ALMA and fluxes of faint
sources detected with stacking, we recover a 1.1 mm surface brightness of up to
20.3 +/- 1.2 Jy/deg, comparable to the extragalactic background light measured
by COBE. Based on the fractions of optically faint sources in our and previous
ALMA studies and the COBE measurements, we find that approximately half of the
cosmic star formation may be obscured by dust and missed by deep optical
surveys, Much deeper and wider ALMA imaging is therefore needed to better
constrain the obscured cosmic star formation history.

strongly correlated {\it molecular} conductors, superconductors and Mott
insulators is poorly known, yet fascinating especially in orbitally degenerate
cases. The fulleride insulator Cs$_{3}$C$_{60}$ (A15), one such system,
exhibits infrared (IR) spectra with low temperature peak features and
splittings suggestive of static Jahn-Teller distortions with breakdown of
orbital symmetry in the molecular site. That is puzzling, for there is no
detectable static distortion, and because the features and splittings disappear
upon modest heating, which they should not. Taking advantage of the
Mott-induced collapse of electronic wavefunctions from lattice-extended to
nanoscale localized inside a caged molecular site, we show that unbroken spin
and orbital symmetry of the ion multiplets explains the IR spectrum without
adjustable parameters. This demonstrates the importance of a fully quantum
treatment of nuclear positions and orbital momenta in the Mott insulator sites,
dynamically but not statically distorted. The observed demise of these features
with temperature is explained by the thermal population of a multiplet term
whose nuclear positions are essentially undistorted, but whose energy is very
low-lying. That term is in facts a scaled-down orbital excitation analogous to
that of other Mott insulators, with the same spin $1/2$ as the ground state,
but with a larger orbital moment of two instead of one.

understandings of migrants' challenges and provides assessments of
post-migration benchmarks like employment, obtention of educational
credentials, and home ownership. Minimal research, however, probes the realm of
emotions or ""feeling states"" in migration and settlement processes, and it is
often approached through closed-ended survey questions that superficially
assess feeling states. The evaluation of emotions in migration and settlement
has been largely left to qualitative researchers using in-depth, interpretive
methods like semi-structured interviewing. This approach also has major
limitations, namely small sample sizes that capture limited geographic
contexts, heavy time burdens analyzing data, and limits to analytic consistency
given the nuances of qualitative data coding. Information about migrant emotion
states, however, would be valuable to governments and NGOs to enable policy and
program development tailored to migrant challenges and frustrations, and would
thereby stimulate economic development through thriving migrant populations. In
this paper, we present an interdisciplinary pilot project that offers a way
through the methodological impasse by subjecting exhaustive qualitative
interviews of migrants to sentiment analysis using the Python NLTK toolkit. We
propose that data scientists can efficiently and accurately produce large-scale
assessments of migrant feeling states through collaboration with social

long-range interacting system of particles in thermal equilibrium is abruptly
changed (quenched) to a different value? While a short-range system, under the
same conditions, will relax in time to a new thermal equilibrium with a uniform
temperature across the system, a long-range system shows a fast relaxation to a
nonequilibrium {\em quasistationary state} (QSS). The lifetime of such an
off-equilibrium state diverges with the system size, and the temperature is
non-uniform across the system. Quite surprisingly, the density profile in the
QSS obtained after the quench is anticorrelated with the temperature profile in
space, thus exhibiting the phenomenon of {\em temperature inversion}: denser
regions are colder than sparser ones. We illustrate with extensive molecular
dynamics simulations the ubiquity of this scenario in a prototypical long-range
interacting system subject to a variety of quenching protocols, and in a model
that mimics an experimental setup of atoms interacting with light in an optical
cavity. We further demonstrate how a procedure of iterative quenching combined
with filtering out the high-energy particles in the system may be employed to
cool the system. Temperature inversion is observed in nature in some
astrophysical settings; our results imply that such a phenomenon should be
observable, and could even be exploitable to advantage, also in controlled

correlations among system-bath interactions (CASBI) -- which have a purely
quantum mechanical origin -- the definition in terms of the bath energy becomes
different. We found that CASBI are necessary to maintain the consistency of the
heat current with thermodynamic laws in the case of strong system-bath
coupling. However, within the context of the quantum master equation approach,
both of these definitions are identical. Through a numerical investigation, we
demonstrate this point for a non-equilibrium spin-boson model and a three-level
heat engine model using the reduced hierarchal equations of motion approach
under strongly coupled and non-Markovian conditions. We observe cyclic behavior
of the heat currents and the work performed by the heat engine,and we find that
their phases depend on the system-bath coupling strength. Through consideration
of the bath heat current, we show that the efficiency of the heat engine
decreases as the strength of the system-bath coupling increases, due to the
CASBI contribution. In the case of a large system-bath coupling, the efficiency
increases further if the bath temperature is decreased, with fixed the ratio of
the bath temperatures, due to the discretized nature of energy eigenstates.

that such model organisms are capable, to some extent, to recognize the fitness

this learning increases phenotype robustness with respect to mutations.
However, this acceleration leads to an additional risk since learning procedure

integrated Talbot cavity at one side of the laser array. The coupling scheme is
called diffraction coupling. By controlling the length of Talbot to be a
quarter of Talbot distance (Zt/4), in-phase mode operation can be selected. The
in-phase operation shows great modal stability under different injection
currents, from the threshold current to the full power current. The far-field
radiation pattern of the in-phase operation contains three lobes, one central
maximum lobe and two side lobes. The interval between adjacent lobes is about
10.5{\deg}. The output power is about 1.5 times that of a single-ridge laser.
Further studies should be taken to achieve better beam performance and reduce
optical losses brought by the integrated Talbot cavity.

of the thermal-tidal instability model. We detected a precursor in the 2016
superoutburst and detected growing (stage A) superhumps with a mean period of
0.0602(1)d in 2016 and in 2013. Combined with the period of superhumps
immediately after the superoutburst, the mass ratio is not as small as in WZ
Sge-type dwarf novae, having orbital periods similar to RZ LMi. By using least
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) two-dimensional power
spectra, we detected possible negative superhumps with a period of 0.05710(1)d.
We estimated the orbital period of 0.05792d, which suggests a mass ratio of
0.105(5). This relatively large mass ratio is even above ordinary SU UMa-type

early-type galaxies (ETGs) are virtually evacuated of warm ionised gas. This
implies that the Lyman-continuum (LyC) radiation produced by an assumed active
galactic nucleus (AGN) can escape from the nuclei of these systems without
being locally reprocessed into nebular emission, which would prevent their
reliable spectroscopic classification as Seyfert galaxies with standard
diagnostic emission-line ratios. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of
these ETGs would then lack nebular emission and be essentially composed of an
old stellar component and the featureless power-law (PL) continuum from the
AGN. A question that arises in this context is whether the AGN component can be
detected with current spectral population synthesis in the optical,
specifically, whether these techniques effectively place an AGN detection
threshold in LyC-leaking galaxies. To quantitatively address this question, we
took a combined approach that involves spectral fitting with STARLIGHT of
synthetic SEDs composed of stellar emission that characterises a 10 Gyr old ETG
and an AGN power-law component that contributes a fraction $0\leq
x_{\mathrm{AGN}} < 1$ of the monochromatic luminosity at $\lambda_0=$ 4020 \AA.
In addition to a set of fits for PL distributions $F_{\nu} \propto
\nu^{-\alpha}$ with the canonical $\alpha=1.5$, we used a base of multiple PLs
with $0.5 \leq \alpha \leq 2$ for a grid of synthetic SEDs with a
signal-to-noise ratio of 5-$10^3$. Our analysis indicates an effective AGN
detection threshold at $x_{\mathrm{AGN}}\simeq 0.26$, which suggests that a
considerable fraction of ETGs hosting significant accretion-powered nuclear
activity may be missing in the AGN demographics.

  Constant Average Distortion","Full version",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper makes two main contributions: The first is the construction of a
near-minimum spanning tree with constant average distortion. The second is a
general equivalence theorem relating two refined notions of distortion: scaling
distortion and prioritized distortion.
  Minimum Spanning Trees of weighted graphs are fundamental objects in numerous
applications. In particular in distributed networks, the minimum spanning tree
of the network is often used to route messages between network nodes.
Unfortunately, while being most efficient in the total cost of connecting all
nodes, minimum spanning trees fail miserably in the desired property of
approximately preserving distances between pairs. While known lower bounds
exclude the possibility of the worst case distortion of a tree being small, it
was shown in [ABN15] that there exists a spanning tree with constant average
distortion. Yet, the weight of such a tree may be significantly larger than
that of the MST. In this paper, we show that any weighted undirected graph
admits a {\em spanning tree} whose weight is at most $(1+\rho)$ times that of
the MST, providing {\em constant average distortion} $O(1/\rho)$. Our result
exhibits the best possible tradeoff of this type.
  This result makes use of a general equivalence theorem relating two recently
developed notions of distortion for metric embedding. The first is the notion
of scaling distortion, which provides improved distortion for $1-\epsilon$
fractions of the pairs, for all $\epsilon$ simultaneously. A stronger version
called coarse scaling distortion, has improved distortion guarantees for the
furthest pairs. The second notion is that of prioritized distortion, a property
allowing to prioritize the nodes whose associated distortions will be improved.
We show that prioritized distortion is essentially equivalent to coarse scaling
distortion via a general transformation.

star, which in turn led to the discovery of a surface magnetic field. Aims : We
want to further constrain the properties of this star, in particular to verify
whether X-ray variations are correlated to changes in optical emission lines
and magnetic field strength, as expected from the oblique rotator model that is
widely accepted for magnetic O stars. Methods: We have obtained new
low-resolution spectropolarimetric and long-term high-resolution spectroscopic
monitoring of Tr16-22, and we also analyse new, serendipitous X-ray data.
Results: The new X-ray observations are consistent with previous data, but
their addition does not help to solve the ambiguity in the variation timescale
because of numerous aliases. No obvious periodicity or any large variations are
detected in the spectropolarimetric data of Tr16-22 obtained over three months.
The derived field values appear to be in line with previous measurements,
suggesting constancy of the field (though the possibility of small, short-term
field variations cannot be excluded). Variations in the equivalent widths of
Halpha are very small, and they do not appear to be related to the X-ray
timescale; the overall lack of large variations in optical emission lines is
consistent with the magnetic field constancy. In addition, variations of the
radial velocities indicate that Tr16-22 is probably a SB1 binary with a very
long period.

reason of its appearance in the D0 and absence in LHCb and CMS is discussed in

which is produced together with the $\pi^\pm B_s^0$ simultaneously. In the
three-body Dalitz plot, once the remaining region is narrow enough after the
kinematic cuts, its reflection to another invariant mass distribution will
accumulate a large number of events within a specific energy region. If there
is an enhancement in the remaining region, it will make the reflection
structure more pronounced. The precise line shape of the reflection will depend
on the specific interaction form. A combined study of different cone cuts and
the low-energy dynamics, e.g. the Landau singularity, demonstrates that the
$X(5568)$ structure could come from this kinematic reflection. This conclusion
can be checked by both searching for the enhancement in another invariant mass
distribution, such as $B_s^0\bar{B}^0$, and the cone cut dependence of the
$X(5568)$ mass. Such a combined study can be used to distinguish the effects of
the triangle singularity from a genuine state. We also propose how to avoid

are coupled to an electromagnetic cavity. Previously it has been shown that if
the mechanical resonances have nearly equal frequencies, one can make the
oscillators to interact via the cavity by strong pumping with a coherent pump
tone. One can view the interaction also as emergence of an electromagnetically
dark mode which gets asymptotically decoupled from the cavity and has a
linewidth much smaller than that of the bare cavity. The narrow linewidth and
long lifetime of the dark mode could be advantageous for example in information
storage and processing. Here we investigate the possibility to create dark
modes dynamically using two pump tones. We show that if the mechanical
frequencies are intrinsically different, one can bring the mechanical
oscillators and the cavity on-resonance and thus create a dark mode by double
sideband pumping of the cavity. We realize the scheme in a microwave
optomechanical device employing two drum oscillators with unmatched
frequencies, {\omega}_1 /2{\pi} = 8.1MHz and {\omega}_2 /2{\pi} = 14.2MHz. We
also observe a breakdown of the rotating-wave approximation, most pronounced in
another device where the mechanical frequencies are close to each other.

operate in groups. To this end, it is essential for them to estimate on-board
the relative location of their neighbors. The challenge lies in limiting the
mass and processing burden needed to enable this. We developed a relative
localization method that only requires the MAVs to communicate via their
wireless transceiver. Communication allows the exchange of on-board states
(velocity, height, and orientation), while the signal-strength provides range
data. These quantities are fused to provide a full relative location estimate.
We used our method to tackle the problem of collision avoidance in tight areas.
The system was tested with a team of AR.Drones flying in a 4mx4m area and with
miniature drones of ~50g in a 2mx2m area. The MAVs were able to track their
relative positions and fly several minutes without collisions. Our
implementation used Bluetooth to communicate between the drones. This featured
significant noise and disturbances in signal-strength, which worsened as more
drones were added. Simulation analysis suggests that results can improve with a
more suitable transceiver module.

investigated within the framework of the dynamical mean-field theory. At
half-filling and for realistic values of the local interaction, the ZGNF is in
a fully compensated antiferromagnetic (AF) state, which is found to be robust
against temperature fluctuations. Introducing charge carriers in the AF
background drives the ZGNF metallic and stabilizes a magnetic state with a net
uncompensated moment at low temperature. The change in magnetism is ascribed to
the delocalization of the doped holes in the proximity of the edges, which
mediate ferromagnetic correlations between the localized magnetic moments.
Depending on the hole concentration, the magnetic transition may display a
pronounced hysteresis over a wide range of temperature, indicating the
coexistence of magnetic states with different symmetry. This suggests the
possibility of achieving the electrostatic control of the magnetic state of
ZGNFs to realize a switchable spintronic device.

  Jets are believed to be induced by magnetic reconnection, a process central

develop in many different environments, e.g., in the vicinity of active regions
as well as in coronal holes, and at various scales, from small photospheric
spicules to large coronal jets. In all these events, signatures of helical
structure and/or twisting/rotating motions are regularly observed. The present
study aims to establish that a single model can generally reproduce the
observed properties of these jet-like events.
  In this study, using our state-of-the-art numerical solver ARMS, we present a
parametric study of a numerical tridimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model
of solar jet-like events. Within the MHD paradigm, we study the impact of
varying the atmospheric plasma $\beta$ on the generation and properties of
solar-like jets.
  The parametric study validates our model of jets for plasma $\beta$ ranging
from $10^{-3}$ to $1$, typical of the different layers and magnetic
environments of the solar atmosphere. Our model of jets can robustly explain
the generation of helical solar jet-like events at various $\beta \le 1$. This
study introduces the new result that the plasma $\beta$ modifies the morphology
of the helical jet, explaining the different observed shapes of jets at
different scales and in different layers of the solar atmosphere.
  Our results allow us to understand the energisation, triggering, and driving
processes of jet-like events. Our model allows us to make predictions of the
impulsiveness and energetics of jets as determined by the surrounding
environment, as well as the morphological properties of the resulting jets.

algorithms for discovering a pattern set that is non-redundant and of high

pattern sets that lack of diversity: Only few patterns of high quality, and
different enough, are discovered. Our main contribution is then to formally
define pattern mining as a game and to solve it with Monte Carlo tree search
(MCTS). It can be seen as an exhaustive search guided by random simulations
which can be stopped early (limited budget) by virtue of its best-first search
property. We show through a comprehensive set of experiments how MCTS enables
the anytime discovery of a diverse pattern set of high quality. It outperforms
other approaches when dealing with a large pattern search space and for
different quality measures. Thanks to its genericity, our MCTS settings can be

dependence of the intensity of the resonant fluorescence of the quantum dot
during this process permits to probe the dynamics of the optical initialization
of the Cr spin. Using this initialization and read-out technique we measured a
Cr spin relaxation time at T=5 K of about 2 microseconds. We finally
demonstrate that, under a resonant single mode laser field, the energy of any
spin state of an individual Cr atom can be independently tuned by using the
optical Stark effect.

has been deployed extensively in decentralized control scenarios. However
standard treatments of FP, and of many other game-theoretic models, assume
rather idealistic conditions which rarely hold in realistic control scenarios.
This paper considers a broad class of best response learning algorithms, that
we refer to as FP-type algorithms. In such an algorithm, given some (possibly
limited) information about the history of actions, each individual forecasts
the future play and chooses a (myopic) best action given their forecast. We
provide a unifed analysis of the behavior of FP-type algorithms under an
important class of perturbations, thus demonstrating robustness to deviations
from the idealistic operating conditions that have been previously assumed.
This robustness result is then used to derive convergence results for two
control-relevant relaxations of standard game-theoretic applications:
distributed (network-based) implementation without full observability and
asynchronous deployment (including in continuous time). In each case the
results follow as a direct consequence of the main robustness result.

include the effects of mechanical heating by stellar winds and radiative
cooling/heating by the ambient field of the dense star cluster. We consider two
examples: the Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC) in the Milky Way central region

galaxy M60-UCD1. We find that the two systems behave in different ways because
they are placed in different areas of parameter space in the instability
diagram: gas temperature vs. dynamical ionization parameter. In the case of
Sgr~A*, stellar heating prevents the spontaneous formation of cold clouds. The
plasma from stellar winds joins the hot X-ray emitting phase and forms an
outflow. In M60-UCD1 our model predicts spontaneous formation of cold clouds in
the inner part of the galaxy. These cold clouds may survive since the cooling

current that allows us to examine this early evolution in detail, we analyze
high-resolution simulations of a 2/1 classical tearing mode in a low-beta large

current grows and spreads throughout the magnetic island, it is not a function

a flux function. We demonstrate numerically that if sufficiently resolved

of the standard cosmological model it is shown that in the case of zero
cosmological constant this system has a stable center corresponding to zero
values of potential and its derivative at infinity. Thus, the cosmological
model based on single massive classical scalar field in infinite future would
give a flat Universe. The carried out numerical simulation of the dynamic
system corresponding to the system of Einstein - Klein - Gordon equations
showed that at great times of the evolution the invariant cosmological
acceleration has an oscillating character and changes from $-2$ (braking), to
$+1$ (acceleration). Average value of the cosmological acceleration is negative
and is equal to $-1/2$. Oscillations of the cosmological acceleration happen on
the background of rapidly falling Hubble constant. In the case of nonzero value
of the cosmological constant depending on its value there are possible three
various qualitative behavior types of the dynamic system on 2-dimensional plane
$(\Phi,\dot{\Phi})$, which correspond either to zero attractive focus or to
stable attractive knot with zero values of the potential and its derivative.
Herewith the system asymptotically enters the secondary inflation. Carried out
numerical simulation showed that at cosmological constant $\Lambda<m^2
3\cdot10^{-8}$ the macroscopic value of the cosmological acceleration behaves
itself similar to the case $\Lambda=0$, i.e. in the course of the cosmological
evolution there appears a lasting stage when this value is close to $-1/2$
which corresponds to non-relativistic equation of state. In this article, the

due to gravitational acceleration difference and the relationship between
perturbing forces and range-rate perturbations are derived, based on the
orthogonality property of associated Legendre functions and the linear orbit
perturbation theory, respectively. This method provides a physical insight into
the relation between mission parameters and scientific requirements. By taking
GRACE-FO as the object of research, the effects of sensor noises and time
variable gravity signals are analyzed. If LRI measurements are applied, a
mission goal with a geoid accuracy of 7.4 cm at a spatial resolution of 101 km
is reachable, whereas if the KBR measurement error model is applied, a mission
goal with a geoid accuracy of 10.2 cm at a spatial resolution of 125 km is
reachable. Based on the discussion of the spectral matching of instrument
accuracies, an improvement in accuracy of accelerometers is necessary for the
match between the range errors and accelerometer noises in the future mission.
Temporal aliasing caused by the time variable gravity signals is also discussed
by this method.

approachable or weakly excludable. In games where only the opponent can quit
(Big-Match of type II), none of our conditions is both sufficient and necessary
for weak approachability. We provide a continuous time sufficient condition
using techniques coming from differential games, and show its usefulness in
practice, in the spirit of Vieille's seminal work for weak
approachability.Finally, we study uniform approachability where the strategy
should not depend on the horizon and demonstrate that, in contrast with
classical Blackwell approacha-bility for convex sets, weak approachability does
not imply uniform approachability.

rate which is found to be enhanced in strongly interacting QGP (sQGP) as
compared to the Born rate in a weakly coupled QGP. We further consider the idea
of entanglement between the chiral and confinement dynamics through the
entangled PNJL (EPNJL) model and re-explore the vector spectral function and
the spectral property such as the dilepton production rate studied in our
earlier effort. Because of the strong entanglement, the coupling strengths run
with the temperature and chemical potential. The implications of such running
on the dilepton rate have been discussed in details. The Euclidean vector
correlator and the response of the conserved density fluctuations related with
the temporal vector correlator have also been investigated. We have considered
both the scenarios, i.e. presence and absence of the vector interaction. The
inclusion of the vector interaction also brings forth some intriguing issues in
the fluctuation of conserved density, namely the QNS. It has been discussed in

vertices in $G$, if it exists, whose deletion disconnects $G$ and leaves each
remaining component with more than $g$ vertices. This paper focuses on the
$g$-extra connectivity of hypercube-like networks (HL-networks for short) which
includes numerous well-known topologies, such as hypercubes, twisted cubes,
crossed cubes and M\""obius cubes. All the known results suggest the equality
$\k_g(X_n)=f_n(g)$ holds, where $X_n$ is an $n$-dimensional HL-network,
$f_n(g)=n(g+1)-\frac{g(g+3)}{2}$, $n\geq 5$ and $0\leq g\leq n-3$? Some authors
also attempted to prove this equality in general. In this paper, we construct a
subfamily of an $n$-dimensional HL-network with $g$-extra connectivity greater
than $f_n(g)$ which implies that the above equality does not hold in general.
We also prove that for $n\geq 5$ and $0\leq g\leq n-3$, $\k_g(X_n)\geq f_n(g)$
always holds. This enables us to give a sufficient condition for the equality
$\k_g(X_n)=f_n(g)$, which is then used to determine the $g$-extra connectivity
of HL-networks for some small $g$ or the $g$-extra connectivity of some
particular subfamily of HL-networks. As a result, a short proof for the main

principal component analysis (PCA), followed by regression in which the

principal components are not selected using the information on the response
variable. In this paper, we propose a one-stage procedure for PCR in the
framework of generalized linear models. The basic loss function is based on a
combination of the regression loss and PCA loss. An estimate of the regression
parameter is obtained as the minimizer of the basic loss function with a sparse
penalty. We call the proposed method sparse principal component regression for
generalized linear models (SPCR-glm). Taking the two loss function into
consideration simultaneously, SPCR-glm enables us to obtain sparse principal
component loadings that are related to a response variable. However, a
combination of loss functions may cause a parameter identification problem, but
this potential problem is avoided by virtue of the sparse penalty. Thus, the
sparse penalty plays two roles in this method. The parameter estimation
procedure is proposed using various update algorithms with the coordinate
descent algorithm. We apply SPCR-glm to two real datasets, doctor visits data
and mouse consomic strain data. SPCR-glm provides more easily interpretable
principal component (PC) scores and clearer classification on PC plots than the
usual PCA.

capacity in fifth-generation (5G) networks, where user equipment is able to
consume radio resources of several serving cells simultaneously and potentially
aggregate bandwidth across all of them. The emerging dual connectivity paradigm
can be regarded as an attractive access mechanism in dense heterogeneous 5G
networks, where bandwidth sharing and cooperative techniques are evolving to
meet the increased capacity requirements. Dual connectivity in the uplink
remained highly controversial, since the user device has a limited power budget
to share between two different access points, especially when located close to
the cell edge. On the other hand, in an attempt to enhance the uplink
communications performance, the concept of uplink and downlink decoupling has
recently been introduced. Leveraging these latest developments, our work
significantly advances prior art by proposing and investigating the concept of
flexible cell association in dual connectivity scenarios, where users are able
to aggregate resources from more than one serving cell. In this setup, the
preferred association policies for the uplink may differ from those for the
downlink, thereby allowing for a truly decoupled access. With the use of
stochastic geometry, the dual connectivity association regions for decoupled
access are derived and the resultant performance is evaluated in terms of

  inhomogeneous random graphs",,,,,"math.PR math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A bootstrap percolation process on a graph with infection threshold $r\ge 1$
is a dissemination process that evolves in time steps. The process begins with
a subset of infected vertices and in each subsequent step every uninfected
vertex that has at least $r$ infected neighbours becomes infected and remains
so forever.
  Critical phenomena in bootstrap percolation processes were originally
observed by Aizenman and Lebowitz in the late 1980s as finite-volume phase
transitions in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ that are caused by the accumulation of small
local islands of infected vertices. They were also observed in the case of
dense (homogeneous) random graphs by Janson, \L uczak, Turova and Valier
(2012). In this paper, we consider the class of inhomogeneous random graphs
known as the Chung-Lu model: each vertex is equipped with a positive weight and
each pair of vertices appears as an edge with probability proportional to the
product of the weights. In particular, we focus on the sparse regime, where the
number of edges is proportional to the number of vertices.
  The main results of this paper determine those weight sequences for which a
critical phenomenon occurs: there is a critical density of vertices that are
infected at the beginning of the process, above which a small (sublinear) set
of infected vertices creates an avalanche of infections that in turn leads to
an outbreak. We show that this occurs essentially only when the tail of the
weight distribution dominates a power law with exponent 3 and we determine the
critical density in this case.

several countries, it involves potential interactions between wildlife and

study addresses connectedness network analysis, the spatial, and temporal
dynamics of TB between cattle in farms and the European badger (Meles meles)
using a large dataset generated by a calibrated agent based model. Results
showed that infected network connectedness was lower in badgers than in cattle.
The contribution of an infected individual to the mean distance of disease
spread over time was considerably lower for badger than cattle; badgers mainly
spread the disease locally while cattle infected both locally and across longer
distances. The majority of badger-induced infections occurred when individual
badgers leave their home sett, and this was positively correlated with badger
population growth rates. Point pattern analysis indicated aggregation in the
spatial pattern of TB prevalence in badger setts across all scales. The spatial
distribution of farms that were not TB free was aggregated at different scales
than the spatial distribution of infected badgers and became random at larger
scales. The spatial cross correlation between infected badger setts and
infected farms revealed that generally infected setts and farms do not coexist
except at few scales. Temporal autocorrelation detected a two year infection
cycle for badgers, while there was both within the year and longer cycles for
infected cattle. Temporal cross correlation indicated that infection cycles in
badgers and cattle are negatively correlated. The implications of these results
for understanding the dynamics of the disease are discussed.

BQC allows a client (Alice) who does not have enough sophisticated technology

quantum computation server (Bob) to delegate universal quantum computation.
During the computation, Bob cannot know Alice's inputs, algorithm and outputs.
In single-server BQC protocol, it requires Alice to prepare and distribute
single-photon states to Bob. Unfortunately, the distributed single photons will
suffer from noise, which not only makes the single-photon state decoherence,
but also makes it loss. In this protocol, we describe an anti-noise BQC
protocol, which combined the ideas of faithful distribution of single-photon
state in collective noise, the feasible quantum nondemolition measurement and
Broadbent-Fitzsimons-Kashefi (BFK) protocol. This protocol has several
advantages. First, Alice does not require any auxiliary resources, which
reduces the client's economic cost. Second, this protocol not only can protect
the state from the collective noise, but also can distill the single photon
from photon loss. Third, the noise setup in Bob is based on the linear optics,
and it is also feasible in experiment. This anti-noise BQC may show that it is
possible to perform the BQC protocol in a noisy environment.

is explored while scanning the entire range of connection strengths, from
tunnel barrier to ballistic contact. We observe a robust scaling of charge
quantization as the square root of the residual electron reflection probability
across a quantum channel when approaching the ballistic critical point, which
also applies beyond the regimes yet accessible to theory. At increased
temperatures, the thermal fluctuations result in an exponential suppression of
charge quantization as well as in a universal square root scaling, for
arbitrary connection strengths, in agreement with expectations. Besides direct
applications to improve single-electron functionalities and for the
metal-semiconductor hybrids emerging in the quest toward topological quantum
computing, the knowledge of the quantum laws of electricity will be essential
for the quantum engineering of future nanoelectronic devices.

surface state energy structure in the vicinity of surface steps using scanning
tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy methods are presented. An increase in the
chemical potential level $\mu$ near the step edge is observed. The value of the
increase $\delta \mu\sim 0.1$~eV is found to correlate with the step height.
The effect is caused by redistribution of electron wave functions between the
outer and inner edges of surface steps, as known for normal metals. The smaller
value of the chemical potential shift and its larger characteristic length of
$\sim 10$~nm reflect specifics of the helical surface states. This increase is
accompanied by enlargement of the normalized differential tunneling conductance
in the helical surface states energy region and thereby produces the illusion
of the appearance of edge states. We show that the enlargement is reproduced in
the framework of the tunneling model taking into account the tunneling gap
transparency change when the chemical potential moves away from the Dirac

a minimization of repulsive Pauli interactions between adjacent molecules at

to idealized, ""rational"" agents) act in strategic situations. Our own recent
work has identified iterative models (such as quantal cognitive hierarchy) as
the state of the art for predicting human play in unrepeated, simultaneous-move
games (Wright & Leyton-Brown 2012, 2016). Iterative models predict that agents
reason iteratively about their opponents, building up from a specification of
nonstrategic behavior called level-0. The modeler is in principle free to
choose any description of level-0 behavior that makes sense for the setting.
However, almost all existing work specifies this behavior as a uniform
distribution over actions. In most games it is not plausible that even
nonstrategic agents would choose an action uniformly at random, nor that other
agents would expect them to do so. A more accurate model for level-0 behavior
has the potential to dramatically improve predictions of human behavior, since
a substantial fraction of agents may play level-0 strategies directly, and
furthermore since iterative models ground all higher-level strategies in
responses to the level-0 strategy. Our work considers models of the way in
which level-0 agents construct a probability distribution over actions, given
an arbitrary game. Using a Bayesian optimization package called SMAC (Hutter,
Hoos, & Leyton-Brown, 2010, 2011, 2012), we systematically evaluated a large
space of such models, each of which makes its prediction based only on general
features that can be computed from any normal form game. In the end, we
recommend a model that achieved excellent performance across the board: a
linear weighting of features that requires the estimation of four weights. We
evaluated the effects of combining this new level-0 model with several
iterative models, and observed large improvements in the models' predictive
accuracies.

of a spin-1/2 particle in the $z-$direction lies outside the conventional
spectrum of $\pm$1.
  In this paper, we investigate the quantum control of the weak value
amplification of a qubit system coupled to a meter, via a second
non-interacting qubit, initially quantum correlated with the first one. Our
results show that for weak measurements, the control can be remotely realized
via the post-selected state of the second qubit or the degree of squeezing of
the meter. Additionally, in a step towards the study of the quantum control of
the amplification, we can easily manipulate the degree of quantum correlations
between the initial correlated qubits. We find that the degree of Entanglement
has no effect on the quantum control of the amplification. However, we have
found a clear connection between the amplification and quantum discord like
measurements as well as classical correlations between the qubits. Moreover, we
generalize the analysis to two control qubits and we can conclude that the
single control qubit scheme is more efficient. Lastly, we suggest an original
application of the amplification control protocol on the enhancement of the
quantum measurement accuracy, e.g. measuring the relative phase of the
post-selected control qubit in a more precise way, as opposed to the
no-amplification case

Current algorithms in anomaly detection are based on the classical density
estimation approach of learning high-dimensional models and finding
low-probability events. These algorithms are sensitive to the order in which
anomalies appear and require either training data or early context assumptions
that do not hold for longer, more complex videos. By defining anomalies as
examples that can be distinguished from other examples in the same video, our
definition inspires a shift in approaches from classical density estimation to
simple discriminative learning. Our contributions include a novel framework for
anomaly detection that is (1) independent of temporal ordering of anomalies,
and (2) unsupervised, requiring no separate training sequences. We show that
our algorithm can achieve state-of-the-art results even when we adjust the

The Kepler space mission led to a large amount of high-precision
time series of solar-like oscillators. Using a Bayesian analysis that combines
asteroseismic techniques and additional ground-based observations, the mass,
radius, luminosity, and distance of those stars can be estimated with good
precision. This has given a new impetus to the research field of galactic
archeology. Aims. The first data release of the Gaia space mission contains the
TGAS catalog with parallax estimates for more than 2 million stars, including
many of the Kepler targets. Our goal is to make a first proper comparison of
asteroseismic and astrometric parallaxes of a selection of dwarfs, subgiants,
and red giants observed by Kepler for which asteroseismic distances were
published. Methods. We compare asteroseismic and astrometric distances of
solar-like pulsators using an appropriate statistical errors-in- variables
model on a linear as well as on a logarithmic scale. Results. For a sample of
22 dwarf and subgiant solar-like oscillators, the TGAS parallaxes considerably
improved the Hipparcos ones, yet the excellent agreement between asteroseismic
and astrometric distances still holds. For a sample of 938 Kepler pulsating red
giants, the TGAS parallaxes are much more uncertain than the asteroseismic
ones, making it worthwhile to validate the former with the latter. From
errors-in-variables modelling we find a significant discrepancy between the
TGAS parallaxes and the asteroseismic ones. Conclusions. For the sample of
dwarfs and subgiants, the comparison between astrometric and asteroseismic
parallaxes does not require a revision of the stellar models on the basis of
TGAS. For the sample of red giants, we identify possible causes of the
discrepancy, which we will likely be able to resolve with the more precise Gaia
parallaxes of the upcoming releases.

of future null-infinity. We propose an approach for the evolution of
hyperboloidal initial data in which the outer boundary of the computational
domain is placed at infinity. The main idea is to apply the `dual foliation'
formalism in combination with hyperboloidal coordinates and the generalized
harmonic gauge formulation. The strength of the present approach is that,
following the ideas of Zenginoglu, a hyperboloidal layer can be naturally
attached to a central region using standard coordinates of numerical relativity
applications. Employing a generalization of the standard hyperboloidal slices,
developed by Calabrese et. al., we find that all formally singular terms take a
trivial limit as we head to null-infinity. A byproduct is a numerical approach
for hyperboloidal evolution of nonlinear wave equations violating the
null-condition. The height-function method, used often for fixed background
spacetimes, is generalized in such a way that the slices can be dynamically
`waggled' to maintain the desired outgoing coordinate lightspeed precisely.
This is achieved by dynamically solving the eikonal equation. As a first
numerical test of the new approach we solve the 3D flat space scalar wave
equation. The simulations, performed with the pseudospectral bamps code, show
that outgoing waves are cleanly absorbed at null-infinity and that errors
converge away rapidly as resolution is increased.

of the distribution amplitude is obtained. We also investigate the one-loop QCD
corrections to the pure leptonic decays of $B$ mesons. We find that, after
subtracting the infrared divergence in the one-loop corrections using the
factorization method, the QCD one-loop corrections to the hard amplitude of
leptonic decay will be zero.

the equilateral-mode non-Gaussianity, $f^\mathrm{equil.}_\mathrm{NL}$, which
the latest results from the Planck satellite constrain by a new upper bound. We
examine constraints on these models in light of the most recent Planck and

lower bound on the sound speed and a corresponding lower bound on the
tensor-scalar ratio of $r \sim 0.01$, so that near-future Cosmic Microwave

inflation models, where the speed of sound increases with time, are not subject

to model cellular growth processes without relying on extensive information on

optimization problem usually aiming at maximal biomass accumulation. A recent
extension to these methods called the dynamic enzyme-cost Flux Balance Analysis
(deFBA) is a fully dynamic modeling method allowing for the prediction of
necessary enzyme levels under changing environmental conditions. However, this
method was designed for deterministic settings in which all dynamics,

(MPC) and its feature to represent the evolution of uncertainties by an
exponentially growing scenario tree. While this representation is able to
construct a deterministic optimization problem in the presence of
uncertainties, the computational cost also increases exponentially. We counter
this by using a receding prediction horizon and reshape the standard deFBA to
the short-time deFBA (sdeFBA). This leads us, along with further simplification
of the scenario tree, to the robust deFBA (rdeFBA). This framework is capable
of handling the uncertainties in the model itself as well as uncertainties
experienced by the modeled system. We applied these algorithms to two
case-studies: a minimal enzymatic nutrient uptake network, and the abstraction
of the core metabolic process in bacteria.

active galactic nuclei (AGN), and outflow phenomena. An evolutionary sequence,
starting from a dust-obscured ultra-luminous infrared galaxy and eventually
leading to an unobscured optical quasar, has been proposed and discussed in the
literature. AGN feedback is usually invoked to expel the obscuring gas and dust
in a blow-out event, but the underlying physical mechanism remains unclear. We
consider AGN feedback driven by radiation pressure on dust, which directly acts
on the obscuring dusty gas. We obtain that radiative feedback can potentially
disrupt dense gas in the infrared-optically thick regime, and that an increase
in the dust-to-gas fraction leads to an increase in the effective Eddington
ratio. Thus the more dusty gas is preferentially expelled by radiative
feedback, and the central AGN is prone to efficiently remove its own obscuring
dust cocoon. Large amounts of dust imply heavy obscuration but also powerful
feedback, suggesting a causal link between dust obscuration and blow-out. In
this picture, AGN feedback and starburst phenomena are intrinsically coupled
through the production of dust in supernova explosions, leading to a natural
interpretation of the observed evolutionary path.

Optim3D to model the transits of three prototype planets: a hot Jupiter, a hot

simulations of the Sun and a K-dwarf star at different wavelength bands from
optical to far-infrared. We modeled the transit using synthetic stellar-disk
images and emulated the temporal variation of the granulation intensity. We
identified two types of granulation noise that act simultaneously during the
planet transit: (i) the intrinsic change in the granulation pattern with
timescales smaller than the usual planet transit, and (ii) the fact that the
transiting planet occults isolated regions of the photosphere that differ in
local surface brightness. Our modeling approach shows that the granulation
pattern has a non-negligible effect on the light curve depth during the
transit, and, consequentially on the determination of the radius of the planet
transiting. The granulation noise appears to be correlated among the different
wavelength ranges either in the visible or in the infrared regions. The
granulation has to be considered as an intrinsic uncertainty (as a result of
stellar variability) on the precise measurements of exoplanet transits of
planets. The full characterization of the granulation is essential for
determining the degree of uncertainty on the planet parameters. In this

well the index of the radial profile, $q$, are nearly the same for both types.

on their inclination. This is in contradiction with the simple geometric idea

study its discrete-time continuous-state-space version and we prove the
existence of the equilibrium distribution. Finally, we discuss the connection

Beam-Emission-Spectroscopy (BES) measurements and gyrokinetic simulations, this
symmetry breaking in ion-scale turbulence in MAST is shown to manifest itself
as a tilt of the spatial correlation function and a finite skew in the
distribution of the fluctuating density field. The tilt is a statistical
expression of the ""shearing"" of the turbulent structures by the mean flow. The
skewness of the distribution is related to the emergence of long-lived density
structures in sheared, near-marginal plasma turbulence. The extent to which
these effects are pronounced is argued (with the aid of the simulations) to
depend on the distance from the nonlinear stability threshold. Away from the
threshold, the symmetry is effectively restored.

data from an emerging scientific community to look at that crucial early stage
in the development of a social network. We show that when the field was very
young, islands of individual researchers labored in relative isolation, and the
coauthorship network was disconnected. Thirty years later, rather than a
cluster of individuals, we find a true collaborative community, bound together
by a robust collaboration network. However, this change did not take place
gradually\textemdash the network remained a loose assortment of isolated
individuals until the mid-2000s, when those smaller parts suddenly knit
themselves together into a single whole. In the rest of this paper, we consider
the role of three factors in these observed structural changes: growth, changes
in social norms, and the introduction of institutions such as field-specific
conferences and journals. We have data from the very earliest years of the
field, a period which includes the introduction of two different institutions:
the first field-specific conference, and the first field-specific journals. We
also identify two relevant behavioral shifts: a discrete increase in
coauthorship coincident with the first conference, and a shift among
established authors away from collaborating with outsiders, towards
collaborating with each other. The interaction of these factors gives us
insight into the formation of collaboration networks more broadly.

Deep Multi-Species Embedding (DMSE), which jointly embeds vectors corresponding

to bird observational data from the citizen science project \textit{eBird}, we

outperform single-species distribution models (random forests and SVMs) as well
as competing multi-label models. Additionally, we demonstrate the benefit of
using a deep neural network to extract features within the embedding and show
how they improve the predictive performance of species distribution modelling.
An important domain contribution of the DMSE model is the ability to discover

habitat preferences among species. As an additional contribution, we provide a

loads to behave as a battery; that is, to absorb and release energy in a
controllable fashion up to fixed and predetermined limits on volume, charge
rate and discharge rate. We derive bounds on the battery capacity that can be
realized and show that there are fundamental trade-offs between battery
parameters. By characterizing the state trajectories under scheduling policies
that emulate two illustrative batteries, we show that the trade-offs occur
because the states that allow the loads to absorb and release energy at high
aggregate rates are conflicting.

  microvascular networks",,,"10.1016/j.cma.2017.05.015",,"q-bio.TO math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Microvessels -blood vessels with diameter less than 200 microns- form large,
intricate networks organized into arterioles, capillaries and venules. In these
networks, the distribution of flow and pressure drop is a highly interlaced
function of single vessel resistances and mutual vessel interactions. In this
paper we propose a mathematical and computational model to study the behavior
of microcirculatory networks subjected to different conditions. The network
geometry is composed of a graph of connected straight cylinders, each one
representing a vessel. The blood flow and pressure drop across the single
vessel, further split into smaller elements, are related through a generalized
Ohm's law featuring a conductivity parameter, function of the vessel cross
section area and geometry, which undergo deformations under pressure loads. The
membrane theory is used to describe the deformation of vessel lumina, tailored
to the structure of thick-walled arterioles and thin-walled venules. In
addition, since venules can possibly experience negative transmural pressures,
a buckling model is also included to represent vessel collapse. The complete
model including arterioles, capillaries and venules represents a nonlinear
system of PDEs, which is approached numerically by finite element
discretization and linearization techniques. We use the model to simulate flow
in the microcirculation of the human eye retina, a terminal system with a
single inlet and outlet. After a phase of validation against experimental
measurements, we simulate the network response to different interstitial
pressure values. Such a study is carried out both for global and localized
variations of the interstitial pressure. In both cases, significant
redistributions of the blood flow in the network arise, highlighting the
importance of considering the single vessel behavior along with its position
and connectivity in the network.

phase unwrapping failure when the frequency ratio between the high frequency
and the low one is too large. Zhang et.al. proposed an enhanced two-frequency
phase-shifting method to use geometric constraints of digital fringe
projection(DFP) to reduce the noise impact due to the large frequency ratio.
However, this method needs to calibrate the DFP system and calculate the
minimum phase map at the nearest position from the camera perspective, these
procedures are are relatively complex and more time-cosuming. In this paper, we
proposed an improved method, which eliminates the system calibration and
determination in Zhang's method,meanwhile does not need to use the low
frequency fringe pattern. In the proposed method,we only need a set of high
frequency fringe patterns to measure the object after the high frequency is
directly estimated by the experiment. Thus the proposed method can simplify the
procedure and improve the speed. Finally, the experimental evaluation is
conducted to prove the validity of the proposed method.The results demonstrate
that the proposed method can overcome the main disadvantages encountered by
Zhang's method.

topological Meissner effect. However, we show that 3-dimensional Chern-Simons
term, which is different from (2+1)-dimensional Chern-Simons term, will instead
destroy traditional Meissner effect. This means that the presence of a
3-dimensional Chern-Simons term naturally guarantees the validity of
""pre-formed pairs"" picture explaining high-T_c superconductivity, because such
a term breaks Meissner effect induced by paired electrons. In particular, if
3-dimensional Chern-Simons gauge fields indeed emerge in the ""pre-formed pairs""
regime, our theory predicts that around the transition temperature T_c the Hall
conductivity {\sigma} should exhibit a scaling law {\sigma}->(T-T_c )^(2/D)
with D being the dimension of the superconducting material.
