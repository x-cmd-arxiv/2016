in order to identify collective rotational structures in the relatively
neutron-rich $^{62}$Ni isotope. \\ {\bf Method:} The
$^{26}$Mg($^{48}$Ca,2$\alpha$4$n\gamma$)$^{62}$Ni complex reaction at beam

identified in mass ($A$) and charge ($Z$) with the Fragment Mass Analyzer (FMA)

Two collective bands, built upon states of single-particle character, were
identified and sizable deformation was assigned to both sequences based on the
measured transitional quadrupole moments, herewith quantifying the deformation
at high spin. \\ {\bf Conclusions:} Based on Cranked Nilsson-Strutinsky
calculations and comparisons with deformed bands in the $A=60$ mass region, the
two rotational bands are understood as being associated with configurations
involving multiple $f_{7/2}$ protons and $g_{9/2}$ neutrons, driving the

Planck temperature and lensing-convergence maps; voids should give decrements
in both. We use zobov voids from the DR12 SDSS CMASS galaxy sample. We base our
analysis on N-body simulations, to avoid a posteriori bias. For the first time,
we detect the signature of voids in CMB lensing: the significance is
$3.2\sigma$, close to $\Lambda$CDM in both amplitude and projected
density-profile shape. A temperature dip is also seen, at modest significance
($2.3\sigma$), with amplitude about 6 times the prediction. This temperature
signal is induced mostly by voids with radius between 100 and 150 Mpc/h, while
the lensing signal is mostly contributed by smaller voids -- as expected;
lensing relates directly to density, while ISW depends on gravitational
potential. The void abundance in observations and simulations agree, as well.
We also repeated the analysis excluding lower-significance voids: no lensing
signal is detected, with an upper limit of about twice the $\Lambda$CDM
prediction. But the mean temperature decrement now becomes non-zero at the
$3.7\sigma$ level (similar to that found by Granett et al.), with amplitude
about 20 times the prediction. However, the observed dependence of temperature
on void size is in poor agreement with simulations, whereas the lensing results
are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM theory. Thus, the overall tension between
theory and observations does not favour non-standard theories of gravity,
despite the hints of an enhanced amplitude for the ISW effect from voids.

of interest, one generally needs to handle large, possibly non-convex or
non-feasible optimization problems. To avoid such problems, we propose a
constructive and systematically applicable sampling-based method to Lyapunov's
inequality verification. This approach proposes verification of the decrease
condition for a candidate Lyapunov function on a finite sampling of a bounded
set of initial conditions and then it extends the validity of the Lyapunov
function to an infinite set of initial conditions by automatically exploiting
continuity properties. This result is based on multi-resolution sampling, to
perform efficient state- space exploration. Using hyper-rectangles as basic
sampling blocks, to account for different constraint scales on different
states, further reduces the amount of samples to be verified. Moreover, the
verification is decentralized in the sampling points, which makes the method
scalable. The proposed methodology is illustrated through examples.

proposes that dependent cache misses are accelerated by migrating the

was behind in this field. Even the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early

  and strings",,,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is known that every graph of sufficiently large chromatic number and
bounded clique number contains, as an induced subgraph, a subdivision of any
fixed forest, and a subdivision of any fixed cycle. Equivalently, forests and
triangles are pervasive, where H is pervasive (in some class of graphs) if for
all s>0, every graph in the class with bounded clique number and sufficiently
large chromatic number contains an induced subdivision of H, with every edge
subdivided at least s times.
  Which other graphs are pervasive? Chalopin, Esperet, Li and Ossona de Mendez
proved that every such graph is a forest of lanterns: roughly, the blocks are
lanterns (graphs obtained from a tree by adding one extra vertex), and there
are rules about how blocks fit together. It is not known whether every forest
of lanterns is pervasive; but in another paper two of us prove that banana
trees (multigraphs obtained from a forest by adding parallel edges) are
pervasive, thus generalizing the two results above. This paper contains the
first half of the proof, which works for any forest of lanterns, not just for
banana trees.
  A class of graphs is r-controlled if for every graph in the class, its
chromatic number is at most some function (determined by the class) of the
largest chromatic number of an r-ball in the graph. In this paper we prove that
for all r>1, every forest of lanterns is pervasive in every r-controlled class
  These results turn out particularly nicely when applied to string graphs
(intersection graphs of sets of curves in the plane). A chandelier is a graph
obtained from a tree by adding a vertex adjacent to its leaves. We prove that
the class of string graphs is 2-controlled, and thus forests of lanterns are
pervasive in this class. Furthermore, string graphs of sufficiently large
chromatic number and bounded clique number contain any fixed chandelier as an
induced subgraph.

bipolar active regions (ARs) presents during their emergence deformations are
known as magnetic tongues. They are attributed to the presence of twist in the
toroidal magnetic flux-tubes that form the ARs. The aim of this article is to
study the twist of newly emerged ARs from the evolution of magnetic tongues
observed in photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms. We apply the procedure
described by Poisson et al. (2015, Solar Phys. 290, 727) to ARs observed over
the full Solar Cycle 23 and the beginning of Cycle 24. Our results show that
the hemispherical rule obtained using the tongues as a proxy of the twist has a
weak sign-dominance (53 % in the southern hemisphere and 58 % in the northern
hemisphere). By defining the variation of the tongue angle, we characterize the
strength of the magnetic tongues during different phases of the AR emergence.
We find that there is a tendency of the tongues to be stronger during the
beginning of the emergence and to become weaker as the AR reaches its maximum
magnetic flux. We compare this evolution with the emergence of a toroidal
flux-rope model with non-uniform twist. The variety of evolution of the tongues
in the analyzed ARs can only be reproduced when using a broad range of twist
profiles, in particular having a large variety of twist gradient in the
direction vertical to the photosphere. Although the analytical model used is a
special case, selected to minimize the complexity of the problem, the results
obtained set new observational constraints to theoretical models of flux-rope
emergence that form bipolar ARs.

therefore alleviate the efficiency droop. Using density functional theory, we
studied a newly fabricated quaternary alloy, GaAs1-x-yPyBix, which can host
significant amounts of Bi, through calculations of its band gap, spin-orbit
splitting, and band offsets with GaAs. We found that the band gap changes of
GaAs1-x-yPyBix relative to GaAs are determined mainly by the local structural
changes around P and Bi atoms rather than their electronic structure
differences. To obtain alloy with lower Auger recombination than GaAs bulk, we
identified the necessary constraints on the compositions of P and Bi. Finally,
we demonstrated that GaAs/GaAs1-x-yPyBix heterojunctions with potentially low
Auger recombination can exhibit small lattice mismatch and large enough band
offsets for strong carrier confinement. This work shows that the electronic

using a simplified, time-dependent numerical model that considers the influence
of both diffusional and kinetic rates on the particle combustion process. It is
assumed that particles react via a single-step, first-order Arrhenius surface
reaction with an oxidizer delivered to the particle surface through gas
diffusion. Unlike the majority of models previously developed for flames in
suspensions, no external parameters are imposed, such as particle ignition
temperature, combustion time, or the assumption of either kinetic- or
diffusion-limited particle combustion regimes. Instead, it is demonstrated that
these parameters are characteristic values of the flame propagation problem
that must be solved together with the burning velocity, and that the a priori
imposition of these parameters from single-particle combustion data may result
in erroneous predictions. It is also shown that both diffusive and kinetic
reaction regimes can alternate within the same flame and that their interaction
may result in non-trivial flame behavior. In fuel-lean mixtures, it is
demonstrated that this interaction leads to certain particle size ranges where
burning velocity increases with increasing particle size, opposite to the
expected trend. For even leaner mixtures, the interplay between kinetic and
diffusive reaction rates leads to the appearance of a new type of flame
instability where kinetic and diffusive regimes alternate in time, resulting in
a pulsating regime of flame propagation.

Trying to simplify this, we show how two-loop (next-to-next-to-leading order)

Fourier Transform, which is significantly faster than the five-dimensional

convolutions and integrate over orientations, leaving only radial integrals.
This reformulation is independent of the underlying shape of the initial linear

from baryonic acoustic oscillations. We also discuss how to account for halo

Wramdemark (1970) and later confirmed by Gr\""obel (1992a,b). Because of the
observed anti-phase variations of the B and V light curves, the latter author
tentatively suggested an ACV type. Apart from its inclusion in the catalog of
New Suspected Variables (NSV 25977), no further investigations of the star have
been published. HD 240121 was included into our target list of ACV candidates
and investigated in order to determine the reason for the observed brightness
variations. All available information on HD 240121 were collected via an
exhaustive data mining procedure. Data from Gr\""obel (1992a,b) were re-analysed
and photometric observations from the NSVS and Hipparcos archives were procured
and investigated. Line-of-sight reddening and stellar parameters were
calculated from archival photometric data. HD 240121 is a young, late B-type
CP2 star of the silicon subgroup. The observed period, amplitude of light
variations and variability pattern (anti-phase variations) are typical of ACV
variables. The occurrence of anti-phase variations of the B and V light curves
is rarely observed and points to the existence of a null wavelength in the
visual spectrum. We therefore strongly encourage further multi-colour
photometric observations of this star.

Ohashi-Kyrian-Semerak SSC, and the spinning particle limit of the
effective-one-body Hamiltonian of [Phys.~Rev.~D.90,~044018(2014)]. We analyze
the four different dynamics in terms of the ISCO shifts and in terms of the
coordinate invariant binding energies, separating higher-order spin
contributions from spin-orbit contributions. The asymptotic gravitational wave
fluxes produced by the spinning body are computed by solving the inhomogeneous
$(2+1)D$ Teukolsky equation and contrasted for the different cases. For small
orbital frequencies $\Omega$, all the prescriptions reduce to the same dynamics
and the same radiation fluxes. For large frequencies, ${x \equiv (M
\Omega)^{2/3} >0.1 }$, where $M$ is the black hole mass, and especially for
positive spins (aligned with orbital angular momentum) a significant
disagreement between the different dynamics is observed. The ISCO shifts can
differ up to a factor two for large positive spins; for the
Ohashi-Kyrian-Semerak and the Pirani SSC the ISCO diverges around dimensionless
spins $\sim0.52$ and $\sim0.94$ respectively. In the spin-orbit part of the
energetics the deviation from the Hamiltonian dynamics is largest for the
Ohashi-Kyrian-Semerak SSC; it exceeds $10\%$ for $x>0.17$. The Tulczyjew and
the Pirani SSCs behave compatible across almost the whole spin and frequency
range. Our results will have direct application in including spin effects to
effective-one-body waveform models for circularized binaries in the
extreme-mass-ratio limit.

the proposed approach simultaneously reduces false positive and negative

1250 A.D., to around 1550 A.D., and to during or shortly before the Great
Eruption of the 1840s. Ejecta from these groups reside in different locations
and provide a firm constraint that Eta Car experienced multiple major eruptions
prior to the 19th century. The 1250 and 1550 events did not share the same
axisymmetry as the Homunculus; the 1250 event was particularly asymmetric, even
one-sided. In addition, the ejecta in the S ridge, which have been associated
with the Great Eruption, appear to predate the ejection of the Homunculus by
several decades. We detect essentially ballistic expansion across multiple
epochs. We find no evidence for large-scale deceleration of the observed knots
that could power the soft X-ray shell by plowing into surrounding material,
suggesting that the observed X-rays arise instead from fast, rarefied ejecta
from the 1840s overtaking the older dense knots. Early deceleration and
subsequent coasting cannot explain the origin of the older outer
ejecta---significant episodic mass loss prior to the 19th century is required.
The timescale and geometry of the past eruptions provide important constraints
for any theoretical physical mechanisms driving Eta Car's behavior.
Non-repeating mechanisms such as the merger of a close binary in a triple
system would require additional complexities to explain the observations.

accessible to both experiment and theory, yet relevant to phenomena from both
cold atoms to nuclear astrophysics. In particular, the strongly interacting
Fermi gas realized in cold-atom experiments is closely related to dilute
neutron matter in neutron star crusts. Unlike the liquid superfluids 4He
(bosons) and 3He (fermions) where quantum turbulence has been studied in the
laboratory, superfluid Fermi gases stand apart for a number of reasons. They
admit a reliable theoretical description based on a DFT called the TDSLDA that
describes both static and dynamic phenomena. Cold atom experiments demonstrate
exquisite control over particle number, spin polarization, density,
temperature, and interaction strength. Topological defects such as domain walls
and quantized vortices, which lie at the heart of quantum turbulence, can be
created and manipulated with time-dependent external potentials, and agree with
the time-dependent theoretical techniques. While similar experimental and
theoretical control exists for weakly interacting Bose gases, the unitary Fermi
gas is strongly interacting. The resulting vortex line density is extremely
high, and quantum turbulence may thus be realized in small systems where
classical turbulence is suppressed. Fermi gases also permit the study of exotic
superfluid phenomena such as a 3D LOFF supersolid, and a finite temperature
pseudo-gap in the regime of classical turbulence. The dynamics associated with
these phenomena has only started to be explored. Finally, superfluid mixtures
have recently been realized, providing experimental access to phenomena like
Andreev-Bashkin entrainment. Superfluid Fermi gases thus provide a rich forum
for addressing phenomena related to quantum turbulence with applications
ranging from terrestrial superfluidity to astrophysical dynamics in neutron
stars.

essentially no known convergence guarantees for this method. We provide global
convergence guarantees for mixtures of two Gaussians with known covariance

geometrically to the correct mean vectors, and provide simple, closed-form
expressions for the convergence rate. As a simple illustration, we show that,
in one dimension, ten steps of the EM algorithm initialized at infinity result
in less than 1\% error estimation of the means. In the finite sample regime, we
show that, under a random initialization, $\tilde{O}(d/\epsilon^2)$ samples
suffice to compute the unknown vectors to within $\epsilon$ in Mahalanobis

We study the long-term variability of the well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy
Mrk 1210 (a.k.a. UGC 4203, or the Phoenix galaxy).
  Methods. The source was observed by many X-ray facilities in the last 20
years. Here we present a NuSTAR observation and put the results in context of
previously published observations.
  Results. NuSTAR observed Mrk 1210 in 2012 for 15.4 ks. The source showed
Compton-thin obscuration similar to that observed by Chandra, Suzaku, BeppoSAX
and XMM-Newton over the past two decades, but different from the first
observation by ASCA in 1995, in which the active nucleus was caught in a low
flux state - or obscured by Compton-thick matter, with a reflection-dominated
spectrum. Thanks to the high-quality hard X-ray spectrum obtained with NuSTAR
and exploiting the long-term spectral coverage spanning 16.9 years, we can
precisely disentangle the transmission and reflection components and put
constraints on both the intrinsic long-term variability and hidden nucleus
scenarios. In the former case, the distance between the reflector and the
source must be at least ~ 2 pc, while in the latter one the eclipsing cloud may
be identified with a water maser-emitting clump.

at 0.25 < z < 1.2 selected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect with the

observations, which allow us to quantify their X-ray morphologies via two
distinct methods: centroid shifts and photon asymmetry. The latter technique
provides nearly unbiased morphology estimates for clusters spanning a broad
range of redshift and data quality. We further compare the X-ray morphologies
of X-ray- and SZ-selected clusters with those of simulated clusters. We do not
find a statistically significant difference in the measured X-ray morphology of
X-ray and SZ-selected clusters over the redshift range probed by these samples,
suggesting that the two are probing similar populations of clusters. We find
that the X-ray morphologies of simulated clusters are statistically
indistinguishable from those of X-ray- or SZ-selected clusters, implying that
the most important physics for dictating the large-scale gas morphology

find no statistically significant redshift evolution in the X-ray morphology

seemingly in contradiction with the redshift-dependent halo merger rate
predicted by simulations.

of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to several key physical parameters of
supermassive black holes (SMBHs), focusing on BH spin ($a_{\star}$) at the high
BH-mass regime ($M_{BH} \geqslant10^9\, M_{\odot}$). We use a large grid of
model spectral energy distribution, assuming geometrically-thin,
optically-thick accretion discs, and spanning a wide range of five physical
parameters: BH mass $M_{BH}$, BH spin $a_{\star}$, Eddington ratio $L /
L_{Edd}$ , redshift $z$, and inclination angle $inc$. Based on the expected
fluxes in the SDSS imaging ugriz bands, we find that $\sim 99.8\%$ of our
models with $M_{BH} \leqslant 10^{9.5}\, M_{\odot}$ are selected as quasar
candidates and thus would have been targeted for spectroscopic follow-up.
However, in the extremely high-mass regime, $\geqslant 10^{10} M_{\odot}$, we
identify a bias against slowly/retrograde spinning SMBHs. The fraction of SEDs
that would have been selected as quasar candidates drops below $\sim50\%$ for
$a_{\star} <0$ across $0.5<z<2$. For particularly massive BHs, with $M_{BH}
\simeq 3\times10^{10}\, M_{\odot}$, this rate drops below $\sim20\%$, and can
be yet lower for specific redshifts. We further find that the chances of
identifying any hypothetical sources with $M_{BH} = 10^{11}\, M_{\odot}$ by
colour selection would be extremely low at the level of $\sim 3\%$. Our
findings, along with several recent theoretical arguments and empirical
findings, demonstrate that the current understanding of the SMBH population at
the high-$M_{BH}$, and particularly the low- or retrograde-spinning regime, is
highly incomplete.

F5V star HD~157587 obtained with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) that reveal the
debris disk as a bright ring structure at a separation of $\sim$80$-$100~AU.
The new GPI data complement recent HST/STIS observations that show the disk
extending out to over 500~AU. The GPI image displays a strong asymmetry along
the projected minor axis as well as a fainter asymmetry along the projected
major axis. We associate the minor and major axis asymmetries with polarized
forward scattering and a possible stellocentric offset, respectively. To
constrain the disk geometry we fit two separate disk models to the polarized
image, each using a different scattering phase function. Both models favor a
disk inclination of $\sim 70\degr$ and a $1.5\pm0.6$ AU stellar offset in the
plane of the sky along the projected major axis of the disk. We find that the
stellar offset in the disk plane, perpendicular to the projected major axis is
degenerate with the form of the scattering phase function and remains poorly
constrained. The disk is not recovered in total intensity due in part to strong
adaptive optics residuals, but we recover three point sources. Considering the
system's proximity to the galactic plane and the point sources' positions
relative to the disk, we consider it likely that they are background objects
and unrelated to the disk's offset from the star.

the previously considered static screening effect. As a result, both the
resonance energy and width increase with the plasma temperature. Furthermore,
dynamical screening can have a huge impact on the $\alpha$-$\alpha$ thermal
nuclear scattering rate. For example, when the temperature is around $10$ keV,
the rate is suppressed by a factor of about $900$. We expect similar thermal
suppressions of nuclear reaction rates to occur in those reactions dominated by
an above threshold resonance with a thermal energy. Dynamical screening effects

function of K-band magnitude, impact parameter and DLA angular size. For an
impact parameter of 0.5"" (3.4 kpc at the redshift of the absorber) our mass
sensitivity is log (M_star/M_sun) ~ 9.2 and drops to ~ 9.0 at separations

likely identification of the absorbing galaxy is discussed, and we conclude
that the galaxy with the largest impact parameter and highest stellar mass is
unlikely to be the host, based on its inconsistency with the N(HI) impact
parameter relation and inconsistent photometric redshift. Whilst we cannot
distinguish between the remaining two candidates as the DLA host, we note that
despite the low spin temperature and relatively high metallicity of the DLA,
the host does not appear to be a particularly luminous (high mass) galaxy.

Optical-Infrared Triple Color (OIRTC), that has been shown to successfully

on SED fitting), representing the first large sample of faint SMGs that bridges
the gap between bright SMGs and normal star-forming galaxies in S$_{850}$ and
$L_{\rm IR}$. We assess the basic properties of TCGs and their relationship
with other galaxy populations at $z\sim2$. We measure the two-point
autocorrelation function for this population and derive a typical halo mass of

suggesting that the difference between these populations may lie in their local
galactic environment. Lastly, on the scale of $\sim8-17$ kpc at $1<z<5$ we find

Our sample contains a high fraction (~80% ) of slow and non-rotators with

find the fraction of slow-rotators to increase dramatically with galaxy mass,

rotators show a clear anti-correlation between h3 and V/sigma, and the slope of
the anti-correlation is steeper in more round galaxies. The radial profiles of
sigma show a clear luminosity and environmental dependence: the 12 most

most luminous galaxies have average h4 ~ 0.05 while less luminous galaxies have
a range of values between 0 and 0.05. Most of our galaxies show positive radial
gradients in h4, and those galaxies also tend to have rising sigma profiles. We
discuss the implications for the relationship among dynamical mass, sigma, h4,

Here, we realize a JPC which eliminates the need for these bulky components.
The pump drive and flux bias are applied in the new device through an on-chip,

demonstrating time-multiplexed amplification of microwave tones that are

metal/dielectric structures, also known as hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs),
using exact analytical Kronig Penney (KP) model. We show that hyperbolic
isofrequency surfaces exist for all combinations of layer permittivities and
thicknesses, and the largest Purcell enhancements (PE) of spontaneous radiation
are achieved away from the nominally hyperbolic region. Detailed comparison of
field distributions, dispersion curves, and Purcell factors (PF) between the
HMMs and Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) guided modes in metal/dielectric
waveguides demonstrates that HMMs are nothing but weakly coupled gap or slab
SPPs modes. Broadband PE is not specific to the HMMs and can be easily attained
in single thin metallic layers. Furthermore, large wavevectors and PE are
always combined with high loss, short propagation distances and large
impedances; hence PE in HMMs is essentially a direct coupling of the energy
into the free electron motion in the metal, or quenching of radiative lifetime.
PE in HMMs is not related to the hyperbolicity per se but is simply the
consequence of the strong dispersion of permittivity in the metals or polar
dielectrics, as our conclusions are relevant also for the infrared HMMs
occurring in nature. When it comes to enhancement of radiating processes and

isotope exchanged single crystals were investigated with doping corresponding
to superconducting transition temperatures from 74\,K underdoped, to 78\,K
overdoped. The apical oxygen site was chosen since its NMR spectrum has narrow
quadrupolar satellites that are well separated from any other resonance.
Non-vortex contributions to the spectra can be deconvolved in the time domain
to determine the local magnetic field distribution from the vortices. Numerical
analysis using Brandt's Ginzburg-Landau theory was used to find structural
parameters of the vortex lattice, penetration depth, and coherence length as a
function of magnetic field in the vortex solid phase. From this analysis we
report a vortex structural transition near 15\,T from an oblique lattice with
an opening angle of $73^{\circ}$ at low magnetic fields to a triangular lattice
with $60^{\circ}$ stabilized at high field. The temperature for onset of vortex
dynamics has been identified with vortex lattice melting. This is independent
of the magnetic field at sufficiently high magnetic field similar to that
reported for YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ and Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$

infrastructure investment is a precursor to economic growth. China is
especially held up as a model to emulate. Based on the largest dataset of its
kind, this paper punctures the twin myths that, first, infrastructure creates
economic value, and, second, China has a distinct advantage in its delivery.
Far from being an engine of economic growth, the typical infrastructure
investment fails to deliver a positive risk adjusted return. Moreover, China's
track record in delivering infrastructure is no better than that of rich
democracies. Where investments are debt-financed, overinvesting in unproductive
projects results in the buildup of debt, monetary expansion, instability in
financial markets, and economic fragility, exactly as we see in China today. We
conclude that poorly managed infrastructure investments are a main explanation
of surfacing economic and financial problems in China. We predict that, unless
China shifts to a lower level of higher-quality infrastructure investments, the
country is headed for an infrastructure-led national financial and economic
crisis, which is likely also to be a crisis for the international economy.
China's infrastructure investment model is not one to follow for other
countries but one to avoid.

derive and optimize the exclusion radii to maximize the {\em hit probability},

another node's cache within its communication range. Contrasting it with
independent content placement, which is used in most prior work, our HCP
strategy often yields a significantly higher cache hit probability. We further
demonstrate that the HCP strategy is effective for small cache sizes and a
small communication radius, which are likely conditions for D2D.

calculated rates is compared with the oxygen 1/T1 NMR data in Herbertsmithite.
We find that the Gaussian approximation for 1/T1 shows behavior qualitatively

significantly underestimates the magnitude of 1/T1 even at room temperature.
Rates obtained from extrapolation of multiple frequency moments give very good

with magnetically driven disc winds and viscous heating. Methods: We consider
an initially massive disc with ~0.1 Msun to track the evolution from the early
stage of PPDs. We solve the time evolution of surface density and temperature
by taking into account viscous heating and the loss of the mass and the angular
momentum by the disc winds within the framework of a standard alpha model for
accretion discs. Our model parameters, turbulent viscosity, disc wind mass
loss, and disc wind torque, which are adopted from local magnetohydrodynamical
simulations and constrained by the global energetics of the gravitational
accretion, largely depends on the physical condition of PPDs, particularly on
the evolution of the vertical magnetic flux in weakly ionized PPDs. Results:
Although there are still uncertainties concerning the evolution of the vertical
magnetic flux remaining, surface densities show a large variety, depending on
the combination of these three parameters, some of which are very different
from the surface density expected from the standard accretion. When a PPD is in
a ""wind-driven accretion"" state with the preserved vertical magnetic field, the
radial dependence of the surface density can be positive in the inner region
<1-10 au. The mass accretion rates are consistent with observations, even in
the very low level of magnetohydrodynamical turbulence. Such a positive radial
slope of the surface density gives a great impact on planet formation because
(i)it inhibits the inward drift or even results in the outward drift of
pebble/boulder-sized solid bodies, and (ii) it also makes the inward type-I
migration of proto-planets slower or even reversed. Conclusions: The variety of
our calculated PPDs should yield a wide variety of exoplanet systems.

between the degree of largeness tracing and the numbers of authors,

with more authors, affiliations or references are likely to be more

economics, papers with more references are not necessary more largeness-driven,

Kinematic studies of large structures in GMCs toward these ring-like structures
may help us to understand how massive stars form. The origin and properties of
the ring-like structure G345.45+1.50 is investigated through observations of
the 13CO(3-2) line. The aim of the observations is to determine the kinematics
in the region and to compare physical characteristics estimated from gas
emission with those previously determined using dust continuum emission. The
13CO(3-2) line was mapped toward the whole ring using the APEX telescope. The
ring is found to be expanding with a velocity of 1.0 km/s, containing a total
mass of 6.9e3 Msun, which agrees well with that determined using 1.2 mm dust
continuum emission. An expansion timescale of 3e6 yr and a total energy of 7e46
erg are estimated. The origin of the ring might have been a supernova
explosion, since a 35.5 cm source, J165920-400424, is located at the center of
the ring without an infrared counterpart. The ring is fragmented, and 104
clumps were identified with diameters of between 0.3 and 1.6 pc, masses of
between 2.3 and 7.5e2 Msun, and densities of between 1.0e2 and 1.0e4 cm^-3. At
least 18% of the clumps are forming stars, as is shown in infrared images.
Assuming that the clumps can be modeled as Bonnor-Ebert spheres, 13 clumps are
collapsing, and the rest of them are in hydrostatic equilibrium with an
external pressure with a median value of 4e4 K cm^-3. In the region, the
molecular outflow IRAS 16562-3959 is identified, with a velocity range of 38.4
km/s, total mass of 13 Msun, and kinematic energy of 7e45 erg. Finally, five
filamentary structures were found at the edge of the ring with an average size
of 3 pc, a width of 0.6 pc, a mass of 2e2 Msun, and a column density of 6e21
cm^-2.

result, any combination of nodes can have edges to any other nodes materialize

effectiveness in pushing bosons into it. This is due to conservation of energy
and particle in isolated systems such as cold atoms. By varying the potential
depth and interaction strength, the systems can further exhibit averse
response, where a deeper emerged potential attracts less bosonic atoms into it.
To explore possibilities for improving the effectiveness, we investigate what
types of system-environment coupling can help bring bosons into a dynamically
emerged sink, and a Lindblad operator corresponding to local cooling is found
to serve the purpose.

axial compressibilities, and equation of state are in good accord with the

been correlated using the calculated compressibility curves and elastic moduli.
Apart from this, we also observe discontinuities in the structural parameters

quantification of intermolecular interactions are described by the 3D Hirshfeld
surfaces and 2D finger print maps. In addition, the computed infra-red (IR)

nature over Ammonium Perchlorate (AP) due to the presence of strong hydrogen
bonding. Pressure dependent IR spectra show blue- and red-shift of bending and
stretching frequencies which leads to weakening and strengthening of the
hydrogen bonding below and above 5 GPa, respectively. The abrupt changes in the
calculated structural, mechanical, and IR spectra suggest that ADN might
undergo a first order structural transformation to a high pressure phase around

atom-atom coherence alternates with signs, showing critical transitions
alternatively in SL operations. This suggests a complexity of the collective
effect emerging in a large ensemble of atoms. Therefore this effect in a SL can
not be simply interpreted by only a part of the whole ensemble. We numerically
solve for a steady state SL including the spatially-dependent LRDDI, and locate
the maximal cavity photon number and the minimal spectral linewidth
respectively at the optimal atomic separations in the setting of an equidistant

is especially true in real world problems such as in social systems, where
there is a significant population of players involved in the game, and the
complexity problem is critical. Previous studies in algorithmic game theory
propose succinct games that enable small descriptions of payoff matrices and
reduction of complexities. However, some of the suggested compromises lose
generality with strict assumptions such as symmetries in utility functions and
cannot be applied to the full range of real world problems that may be
presented. Graphical games are relatively promising, with a good balance
between complexity and generality. However, they assume a given graph structure
of players' interactions and cannot be applied to games without such known
graphs. This study proposes a method to identify an interaction graph between
players and subsequently decompose games into smaller components by cutting out
weak interactions for the purpose of reducing complexity. At the beginning,
players' mutual dependencies on their utilities are quantified as
variance-covariance matrices among players. Then, the interaction graphs among
players are identified by solving eigenvalue problems. Players' interactions
are further decomposed into linear combinations of games. This helps to find a
consistent equilibrium, which is a Nash equilibrium specified by the
decomposition, with reduced computational complexity. Finally, experiments on
simple example games are shown to verify the proposed method.

estimation in traditional software projects, little work has been done for
estimation in agile projects, especially estimating user stories or issues.
Story points are the most common unit of measure used for estimating the effort
involved in implementing a user story or resolving an issue. In this paper, we
offer for the \emph{first} time a comprehensive dataset for story points-based
estimation that contains 23,313 issues from 16 open source projects. We also
propose a prediction model for estimating story points based on a novel
combination of two powerful deep learning architectures: long short-term memory
and recurrent highway network. Our prediction system is \emph{end-to-end}
trainable from raw input data to prediction outcomes without any manual feature
engineering. An empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach
consistently outperforms three common effort estimation baselines and two
alternatives in both Mean Absolute Error and the Standardized Accuracy.

supports brain function and can be manipulated via local brain stimulation.
Such perturbations to local cortical dynamics are globally integrated by
distinct neural systems. However, it remains unclear how and why local changes
in neural activity affect large-scale system dynamics. Here, we briefly review
empirical and computational studies addressing how localized perturbations
affect brain activity. We then systematically analyze a model of large-scale
brain dynamics, assessing how localized changes in brain activity at the
different sites affect whole-brain dynamics. We find that local stimulation
induces changes in brain activity that can be summarized by relatively smooth
tuning curves, which relate a region's effectiveness as a stimulation site to
its position within the cortical hierarchy. Our results also support the notion
that brain hubs, operating in a slower regime, are more resilient to focal
perturbations and critically contribute to maintain stability in global brain
dynamics. In contrast, perturbations of peripheral regions, characterized by
faster activity, have greater impact on functional connectivity. As a parallel
with this region-level result, we also find that peripheral systems such as the
visual and sensorimotor networks were more affected by local perturbations than
high-level systems such as the cingulo-opercular network. Our results highlight
the importance of a periphery-to-core hierarchy to determine the effect of
local stimulation on the brain network. We also provide novel resources to
orient empirical work aiming at manipulating functional connectivity using
non-invasive brain stimulation.

support to be established as facts. Unfortunately, not every claim accorded the
status of fact turns out to be true. In this paper, we model the dynamic
process by which claims are canonized as fact through repeated experimental
confirmation. The community's confidence in a claim constitutes a Markov
process: each successive published result shifts the degree of belief, until
sufficient evidence accumulates to accept the claim as fact or to reject it as
false. In our model, publication bias --- in which positive results are
published preferentially over negative ones --- influences the distribution of
published results. We find that when readers do not know the degree of
publication bias and thus cannot condition on it, false claims often can be
canonized as facts. Unless a sufficient fraction of negative results are
published, the scientific process will do a poor job at discriminating false
from true claims. This problem is exacerbated when scientists engage in
p-hacking, data dredging, and other behaviors that increase the rate at which
false positives are published. If negative results become easier to publish as
a claim approaches acceptance as a fact, however, true and false claims can be
more readily distinguished. To the degree that the model accurately represents
current scholarly practice, there will be serious concern about the validity of
purported facts in some areas of scientific research.

resolution imaging unambiguously shows that individual collisions lead to
sticking with a high probability of 20 percent. This leads to connected
clusters of aggregates. The contact areas between two aggregates increase with
collision velocity. However, this cluster growth is only temporary, as
subsequent collisions of aggregates and clusters eventually lead to the
detachment of all aggregates from a cluster. The contacts are very fragile as
aggregates cannot be compressed further or fragment under our experimental

information due to the remaining uncertainty of the covariance matrix. Here, we
quantify this loss of precision and develop a framework to hypothetically
restore it, which allows to judge how far away a given analysis is from the
ideal case of a known covariance matrix. We point out that it is insufficient
to estimate this loss by debiasing a Fisher matrix as previously done, due to a
fundamental inequality that describes how biases arise in non-linear functions.
We therefore develop direct estimators for parameter credibility contours and
the figure of merit. We apply our results to DES Science Verification weak
lensing data, detecting a 10% loss of information that increases their
credibility contours. No significant loss of information is found for KiDS. For
a Euclid-like survey, with about 10 nuisance parameters we find that 2900

with an additional uncertainty of about 2%. Without any nuisance parameters
1900 simulations are sufficient to only lose 1% of information. We also derive
an estimator for the Fisher matrix of the unknown true covariance matrix, two
estimators of its inverse with different physical meanings, and an estimator

by induction through the chromosphere into thermal energy. The helium and
hydrogen mixture exhaled by the Sun is then heated by the inverse Joule-Thomson

of the solar wind on 10-11 May 1999 demonstrated that its velocity is a more
faithful indicator of solar activity than are sunspots as it reflects
short-term variations in coronal heating rather than quasicyclical fluctuations

back-off to customization, but group profiles often suffer from accidental

paper we propose a generalized group profiling approach that teases apart the
exact contribution of the individual user level and the ""abstract"" group level

propose an efficient way of group profiling which implicitly eliminates the
general and specific features from users' models in a group and takes out the
abstract model representing the whole group. Second, we employ the resulting
models in the task of contextual suggestion. We analyse different grouping
criteria and we find that group-based suggestions improve the customization.
Third, we see that the granularity of groups affects the quality of group

a more tractable (and directly comparable) parameter based solely on the

show that skeleton dimension admits an intuitive definition for both directed

their relationships at different levels of abstraction. However, hierarchical
data dependencies cause difficulties in the estimation of ""separable"" models

separable models of hierarchical entities requires us to take their relative
position into account and to consider the different types of dependencies in
the hierarchy. In this paper, we present an investigation of the effect of
separability in text-based entity classification and argue that in hierarchical
classification, a separation property should be established between entities
not only in the same layer, but also in different layers. Our main findings are
the followings. First, we analyse the importance of separability on the data
representation in the task of classification and based on that, we introduce a
""Strong Separation Principle"" for optimizing expected effectiveness of
classifiers decision based on separation property. Second, we present
Hierarchical Significant Words Language Models (HSWLM) which capture all, and
only, the essential features of hierarchical entities according to their
relative position in the hierarchy resulting in horizontally and vertically
separable models. Third, we validate our claims on real-world data and
demonstrate that how HSWLM improves the accuracy of classification and how it
provides transferable models over time. Although discussions in this paper
focus on the classification problem, the models are applicable to any
information access tasks on data that has, or can be mapped to, a hierarchical

devoting special attention on how such a variability modulates species fitness.
The environment is dichotomous and stochastically alternates between periods
favoring one of the species while disfavoring the other one, preserving
neutrality on the long term. We study two different scenarios: in the first one
species fitness varies linearly with the environment, and in the second one the
effective fitness is re-scaled by the total fitness of the individuals
competing for the same resource. We find that, in the former case environmental
fluctuations always reduce the time of species coexistence, whereas such a time
can be enhanced or reduced in the latter case, depending on the correlation
time of the environment. This phenomenon can be understood as a direct
consequence of Chesson's storage effect.

have 74 WDs in our sample, of which almost all are low polarized WDs with
polarization degree (PD) smaller than 1%, while only 2 have PD higher than 1%.
There is an evidence that on average the isolated WDs of DC type have higher PD
(with median PD of 0.78%) than the isolated DA type WDs (with median PD of
0.36%). On the other hand, the median PD of isolated DA type WDs is almost the
same, i.e. 0.36% as the median PD of DA type white dwarfs in binary systems
with red dwarfs (dM type), i.e. 0.33%. This shows, as expected, that there is
no contribution to the PD from the companion if the WD companion is the red
dwarf, which is the most common situation for WDs binary systems. We do not
find differences in the polarization degree between magnetic and non-magnetic
WDs. Because 97% of WDs in our sample have PD lower than 1%, they can be used
as faint zero--polarized standard star in the magnitude range from 13 up to 17
of SDSS r filter. They cover the Northern sky between 13 hour to 23 hour in
right ascension and from -11 degrees to 78 degrees in declination.

with correlated site potentials. The external electric field, associated with
voltage bias, leads to unequal charge currents for two different polarities of
external bias and this effect is further enhanced by incorporating the
asymmetry in wire-to-electrode coupling. Our calculations suggest that in some
cases almost cent percent rectification is obtained for a wide bias window.
This performance is valid against disorder configurations and thus we can
expect an experimental verification of our theoretical analysis in near future.

modeled disk-integrated solar RVs using surface velocities, limb darkening, and

a relative precision of 10% with residuals less than 30 m s$^{-1}$. We
cross-checked parameterizations of velocity fields using a Dopplergram from the

necessary for m s$^{-1}$ RV work. As main limitation for modeling RVs during
eclipses, we identified limited knowledge about convective blueshift and line
shape as functions of solar limb angle. We suspect that our model line profiles
are too shallow at limb angles larger than $\mu = 0.6$ resulting in incorrect
weighting of the velocities across the solar disk. Alternative explanations
cannot be excluded like suppression of convection in magnetic areas and
undiscovered systematics during eclipse observations. Accurate observations of

multi-band ancillary data covering a wide range in frequency, essential for
characterising the physical and evolutionary properties of the various source
populations detected in deep radio fields (mainly star-forming galaxies and
AGNs). In this paper we present new 150-MHz observations carried out with the
LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), allowing us to explore a new spectral window for
the faint radio source population. This 150-MHz image covers an area of 34.7
square degrees with a resolution of 18.6$\times$14.7 arcsec and reaches an rms
of 160 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at the centre of the field.
  As expected for a low-frequency selected sample, the vast majority of sources
exhibit steep spectra, with a median spectral index of
$\alpha_{150}^{1400}=-0.78\pm0.015$. The median spectral index becomes slightly
flatter (increasing from $\alpha_{150}^{1400}=-0.84$ to
$\alpha_{150}^{1400}=-0.75$) with decreasing flux density down to $S_{150}
\sim$10 mJy before flattening out and remaining constant below this flux level.
For a bright subset of the 150-MHz selected sample we can trace the spectral
properties down to lower frequencies using 60-MHz LOFAR observations, finding
tentative evidence for sources to become flatter in spectrum between 60 and 150
MHz. Using the deep, multi-frequency data available in the Lockman Hole, we
identify a sample of 100 Ultra-steep spectrum (USS) sources and 13 peaked
spectrum sources. We estimate that up to 21 percent of these could have $z>4$
and are candidate high-$z$ radio galaxies, but further follow-up observations
are required to confirm the physical nature of these objects.

subglacial volcano, one of the most active and hazardous volcanoes in Iceland.
This was associated with deepening of cauldrons on the ice cap and a glacial
flood that caused damage to infrastructure. Increased earthquake activity
within the caldera started a few days before and lasted for months afterwards
and new seismic activity started on the south flank. No visible eruption broke
the ice and the question arose as to whether this episode relates to a minor
subglacial eruption with the tremor being generated by volcanic processes, or
by the flood. The tremor signal consisted of bursts with varying amplitude and
duration. We have identified and described three different tremor phases, based
on amplitude and frequency features. A tremor phase associated with the flood
was recorded only at stations closest to the river that flooded, correlating in
time with rising water level observed at gauging stations. Using
back-projection of double cross-correlations, two other phases have been
located near the active ice cauldrons and are interpreted to be caused by
volcanic or hydrothermal processes. The greatly increased seismicity and
evidence of rapid melting of the glacier may be explained by a minor
sub-glacial eruption. It is also plausible that the tremor was generated by
hydrothermal boiling and/or explosions with no magma involved. This may have
been induced by pressure drop triggered by the release of water when the
glacial flood started. All interpretations require an increase of heat released
by the volcano.

fitting the SED of the Herschel Reference Survey, a complete volume-limited
K-band-selected sample of nearby galaxies including objects in different
density regions, from the core of the Virgo cluster to the general field. The
SED are fitted using the CIGALE SED modelling code. The truncated activity of
cluster galaxies is parametrised using a specific SFH with 2 free parameters,
the quenching age QA and the quenching factor QF. These 2 parameters are
crucial for the identification of the quenching mechanism which acts on long
timescales if starvation while rapid and efficient if ram pressure. To be
sensitive to an abrupt and recent variation of the star formation activity, we
combine in a new way 20 UV to FIR photometric bands with 3 age-sensitive Balmer
line absorption indices extracted from available medium-resolution integrated
spectroscopy and with Halpha narrow band imaging data. The use of a truncated
SFH significantly increases the quality of the fit in those objects whose
atomic gas content has been removed during the interaction with the hostile
cluster environment. The typical QA of the perturbed late-type galaxies is QA <
300 Myr whenever the activity of star formation is reduced by 50% < QF <= 80%
and QA < 500 Myr for QF > 80%, while that of the quiescent early-types is QA ~
1-3 Gyr. The fraction of late-types with a star formation activity reduced by
QF > 80% and with an HI-deficiency parameter HI-def > 0.4 drops by a factor of
~ 5 from the inner half virial radius of the Virgo cluster, where the hot
diffuse X-ray emitting gas of the cluster is located, to the outer regions. The
efficient quenching of the star formation activity observed in Virgo suggests
that the dominant stripping process is ram pressure. We discuss the implication
of this result in the cosmological context of galaxy evolution.

imaging, leading to an alternated minimization problem. In that work, only a
positivity constraint was considered, and the problem was solved by an
approximated Gauss-Seidel method. In this paper, we propose to improve the
approach on three fundamental aspects. Firstly, we define the estimated image
as a solution of a regularized minimization problem, promoting sparsity in a
fixed dictionary using either an $\ell_1$ or a weighted-$\ell_1$ regularization
term. Secondly, we solve the resultant non-convex minimization problem using a
block-coordinate forward-backward algorithm. This algorithm is able to deal
both with smooth and non-smooth functions, and benefits from convergence
guarantees even in a non-convex context. Finally, we generalize our model and
algorithm to the hyperspectral case, promoting a joint sparsity prior through
an $\ell_{2,1}$ regularization term. We present simulation results, both for
monochromatic and hyperspectral cases, to validate the proposed approach.

direct access to the codebook, but only to noisy versions of the various
randomly generated codewords, a problem motivated by biometrical identification
systems. Both the source that generates the original (clean) codewords, and the
channel that corrupts them in generating the noisy codewords, as well as the
main channel for communicating the messages, are all modeled by non-unifilar,
finite-state systems (hidden Markov models). As in previous works on universal
decoding, here too, the average error probability of our proposed universal
decoder is shown to be as small as that of the optimal maximum likelihood (ML)
decoder, up to a multiplicative factorthat is a sub-exponential function of the
block length. It therefore has the same error exponent, whenever the ML decoder
has a positive error exponent. The universal decoding metric is based on
Lempel-Ziv (LZ) incremental parsing of each noisy codeword jointly with the
given channel output vector, but this metric is somewhat different from the one
proposed in earlier works on universal decoding for finite-state channels, by
Ziv (1985) and by Lapidoth and Ziv (1998). The reason for the difference is
that here, unlike in those earlier works, the probability distribution that
governs the (noisy) codewords is, in general, not uniform across its support.
This non-uniformity of the codeword distribution also makes our derivation more
challenging. Another reason for the more challenging analysis is the fact that
the effective induced channel between the noisy codeword of the transmitted
message and the main channel output is not a finite-state channel in general.

is found using the force-balance equation, from the measured density profile
and the trapping potential. The pressure is compared to zero-temperature models
within the local density approximation. In the weakly-interacting regime, the
pressure lies above a Landau Fermi-liquid theory and below the ideal-Fermi-gas

theory. The values closest to the data are provided by the approach where the
mean-field of Cooper pairs is supplemented with fluctuations. In the regime of
strong interactions, in response to the increasing attraction, the pressure
shifts below this model reaching lower values calculated within Monte Carlo

kinematics is either small or absent. In particular, comparison with a lattice
Monte Carlo suggests that kinematics is 2D in the strongly-interacting regime.

micron absorption band of water ice in the VIRTIS spectral cubes. Out of the 13
selected bright spots, eight of them present positive H$_2$O ice detection on

modeling the spectra with mixing (areal and intimate) of H$_2$O ice and dark

by the boundary-layer thicknesses at the inner and outer cylinder and the
angular momentum in the center, profiles and torques are extracted from the
requirement that the boundary layers represent marginally stable TC subsystems
and that the torque at the inner and outer cylinder coincide. This model then
explains the broad shoulder in the torque as a function of rotation number near
$R_\Omega\approx 0.2$. For rotation numbers $R_\Omega < 0.07$ the TC stability
conditions predict boundary layers in which shear Reynolds numbers are very
large. Assuming that the TC instability is bypassed by some shear instability,
a second maximum in torque appears, in very good agreement with numerical
simulations. The results show that, despite the shortcomings of marginal

masses, is well-known example of completely integrable system. Billiards with
different particles are generically not integrable, but still exhibit
divergence of a heat conduction coefficient (HCC) in thermodynamic limit.
Traditional billiard models imply instantaneous (zero-time) collisions between
the particles. We lift this condition and consider the heat transport in a
chain of stiff colliding particles with power-law potential of the
nearest-neighbor interaction. The instantaneous collisions correspond to the
limit of infinite power in the interaction potential; for finite powers, the
interactions take nonzero time. This modification of the model leads to
profound physical consequence -- probability of multiple, in particular, triple
particle collisions becomes nonzero. Contrary to the integrable billiard of
equal particles, the modified model exhibits saturation of the heat conduction
coefficient for large system size. Moreover, identification of scattering
events with the triple particle collisions leads to simple definition of
characteristic mean free path and kinetic description of the heat transport.
This approach allows prediction both of temperature and density dependencies
for the HCC limit values. The latter dependence is quite counterintuitive - the
HCC is inversely proportional to the particle density in the chain. Both
predictions are confirmed by direct numeric simulations.

block Toeplitz matrix with Toeplitz blocks also have been developed. This paper
is concerned with preconditioning of linear systems of equations with a
symmetric block Toeplitz matrix with symmetric Toeplitz blocks that stem from
the discretization of a linear ill-posed problem. The right-hand side of the
linear systems represents available data and is assumed to be contaminated by
error. These kinds of linear systems arise, e.g., in image deblurring problems.
It is important that the preconditioner does not affect the invariant subspace
associated with the smallest eigenvalues of the block Toeplitz matrix to avoid
severe propagation of the error in the right-hand side. A perturbation result
indicates how the dimension of the subspace associated with the smallest
eigenvalues should be chosen and allows the determination of a suitable
preconditioner when an estimate of the error in the right-hand side is
available. This estimate also is used to decide how many iterations to carry
out by a minimum residual iterative method. Applications to image restoration
are presented.

thought of as real M\""obius transformations. We define a semigroup $S$ of
M\""obius transformations to be \emph{semidiscrete} if the identity
transformation is not an accumulation point of $S$. We say that $S$ is
\emph{inverse free} if it does not contain the identity element. One of our
main results states that if $S$ is a semigroup generated by some finite
collection $\mathcal{F}$ of M\""obius transformations, then $S$ is semidiscrete
and inverse free if and only if every sequence of the form $F_n=f_1\dotsb f_n$,
where $f_n\in\mathcal{F}$, converges pointwise on the upper half-plane to a
point on the ideal boundary, where convergence is with respect to the chordal
metric on the extended complex plane. We fully classify all two-generator
semidiscrete semigroups, and include a version of J{\o}rgensen's inequality for
semigroups.
  We also prove theorems that have familiar counterparts in the theory of
Fuchsian groups. For instance, we prove that every semigroup is one of four
standard types: elementary, semidiscrete, dense in the M\""obius group, or
composed of transformations that fix some nontrivial subinterval of the
extended real line. As a consequence of this theorem, we prove that, with
certain minor exceptions, a finitely-generated semigroup $S$ is semidiscrete if
and only if every two-generator semigroup contained in $S$ is semidiscrete.
  After this we examine the relationship between the size of the `group part'
of a semigroup and the intersection of its forward and backward limit sets. In
particular, we prove that if $S$ is a finitely-generated nonelementary
semigroup, then $S$ is a group if and only if its two limit sets are equal.

plays an important role both as a driver of flow and as a risk factor for

  The full effect of geomechanics on aquifer flow can only be captured using a
coupled flow-geomechanics model. In order to solve this computationally
expensive system, various strategies have been put forwards over the years,
with some of the best current methods based on sequential splitting.
  In the present work, we seek to approximate the full geomechanical effect on
flow without the need of coupling with a geomechanics solver during simulation,
and at a computational cost comparable to that of an uncoupled model. We do
this by means of precomputed pressure response functions. At grid model
generation time, a geomechanics solver is used to compute the mechanical
response of the aquifer for a set of pressure fields. The relevant information
from these responses is then stored in a compact form and embedded with the
grid model.
  We test the accuracy and computational performance of our approach on a
simple 2D and a more complex 3D model, and compare the results with those
produced by a fully coupled approach as well as from a simple decoupled method
based on Geertsma's uniaxial expansion coefficient.

the Helmholtz equation in order to establish the well-posedness results of the

beat a benchmark. Two kinds of objectives are considered. One concerns the
probability of outperforming the benchmark and seeks either to minimise the
decay rate of the probability that the portfolio exceeds the benchmark or to
maximise the decay rate that the portfolio falls short. The other criterion
concerns the growth rate of the risk-sensitive utility of wealth which has to
be either minimised, for the risk-averse investor, or maximised, for the
risk-seeking investor. It is assumed that the mean returns and volatilities of
the securities are affected by an economic factor, possibly, in a nonlinear
fashion. The economic factor and the benchmark are modelled with general It\^o
differential equations. The results identify optimal portfolios and produce
decay, or growth, rates. The portfolios have the form of time-homogeneous
functions of the economic factor. Furthermore, a uniform treatment is given to
the out- and under- performance probability optimisation as well as to the
risk-averse and risk-seeking optimisation. In particular, it is shown that
there exists a portfolio that optimises the decay rates of both the
outperfomance probability and the underperformance probability. Whereas earlier
research on the subject has relied on the techniques of stochastic optimal
control and dynamic programming, in this contribution the quantities of
interest are studied directly by employing the methods of the large deviation

non-selfinjective finite dimensional algebra is finite. In \cite{Yam}, Yamagata
stated the stronger conjecture that the dominant dimension of a
non-selfinjective finite dimensional algebra is bounded by a function depending
on the number of simple modules of that algebra. With a view towards those
conjectures, new bounds on dominant dimensions seem desirable. We give a new
approach to bounds on the dominant dimension of gendo-symmetric algebras via
counting non-isomorphic indecomposable summands of rigid modules in the module
category of those algebras. On the other hand, by Mueller's theorem, the
calculation of dominant dimensions is directly related to the calculation of
certain Ext-groups. Motivated by this connection, we generalize a theorem of
Tachikawa about non-vanishing of $Ext^{1}(M,M)$ for a non-projective module $M$
in group algebras of $p$-groups to local Hopf algebras and we also give new
results for showing the non-vanishing of $Ext^{1}(M,M)$ for certain modules in
other local selfinjective algebras, which specializes to show that blocks of
category $\mathcal{O}$ and 1-quasi-hereditary algebras with a special duality
have dominant dimension exactly 2. In the final section we raise different
questions with the hope of a new developement on those conjectures in the

that the entanglement of two mechanical oscillators can be achieved with the
assistance of a two-level atom and cavity-radiation pressure. In the resonant
case, the operation time is relatively short, which is desirable to minimize
the effects of decoherence. While in the large-detuning case, the cavity is
only virtually excited during the interaction. Therefore, the decay of the
cavity is effectively suppressed, which makes the efficient decoherence time of
the cavity to be greatly prolonged. Thus, we observe that this virtual-photon
process of microscopic objects may induce the entanglement of macroscopic
objects. Moreover, in both cases, the generation of entanglement is
deterministic and no measurements on the atom and the cavity are required.
These are experimentally important. Finally, the decoherence effect and the
experimental feasibility of the proposal are briefly discussed.

magnetohydrodynamic simulations of different jet models threaded by a helical
magnetic field have been analyzed covering a wide region in the magnetosonic
Mach number - specific internal energy plane. The merit of this plane is that
models dominated by different types of energy (internal energy: hot jets;
rest-mass energy: kinetically dominated jets; magnetic energy: Poynting-flux
dominated jets) occupy well separated regions. The analyzed models also cover a
wide range of magnetizations. Models dominated by the internal energy (i.e.,
hot models, or Poynting-flux dominated jets with magnetizations larger than but
close to 1) have a rich internal structure characterized by a series of
recollimation shocks and present the largest variations in the flow Lorentz
factor (and internal energy density). Conversely, in kinetically dominated
models there is not much internal nor magnetic energy to be converted into
kinetic one and the jets are featureless, with small variations in the flow
Lorentz factor. The presence of a significant toroidal magnetic field threading
the jet produces large gradients in the transversal profile of the internal
energy density. Poynting-flux dominated models with high magnetization (>10)
are prone to be unstable against magnetic pinch modes, which sets limits to the
expected magnetization in parsec-scale AGN jets {and/or constrains their
magnetic field configuration}.

electrodeposition of Ni-Co/Cu multilayers has been studied to clarify if the

and if this potential results in the largest giant magnetoresistance (GMR) for
the particular alloy system studied. For this purpose, several Ni-Co/Cu
multilayers were prepared by varying the deposition potential of the Cu layer.
The composition analysis of the deposits showed that the Ni:Co ratio exhibits a
minimum as a function of the Cu deposition potential, which can be explained by
considering both the dissolution of Co and the mass transport of the reactants.
Both the saturation GMR value and the intensity of the satellite peaks in the
X-ray diffractograms were highly correlated with the resulting surface
roughness of the deposits which was strongly varying with the Cu deposition
potential. Higher GMR values, lower saturation fields and more perfect
multilayer structure were observed for sufficiently positive Cu deposition
potentials only which enabled a partial Co dissolution resulting in a reduced
surface roughness. The results draw attention to the complexity of the

that occurred between one and four thousand years ago, and subsequently evolved
into a mixed-morphology remnant, which is interacting with molecular clouds
(MC). $\gamma$-ray observations of SNR/MC associations are a powerful tool to
constrain the origin of Galactic cosmic-rays, as they can probe the
acceleration of hadrons through their interaction with the surrounding medium
and subsequent emission of non-thermal photons. The detection of a $\gamma$-ray
source coincident with W49B at very high energies (VHE; E > 100 GeV) with the
H.E.S.S. Cherenkov telescopes is reported together with a study of the source
with 5 years of Fermi-LAT high energy $\gamma$-ray (0.06 - 300 GeV) data. The
smoothly-connected combined source spectrum, measured from 60 MeV to multi-TeV
energies, shows two significant spectral breaks at $304\pm20$ MeV and
$8.4_{-2.5}^{+2.2}$ GeV, the latter being constrained by the joint fit from the
two instruments. The detected spectral features are similar to those observed
in several other SNR/MC associations and are found to be indicative of
$\gamma$-ray emission produced through neutral-pion decay.

activity on early Mars, but a consensus has yet to emerge regarding the
mechanism for producing it. One hypothesis suggests early Mars was warmed by a
thick greenhouse atmosphere. Another suggests that early Mars was generally
cold but was warmed occasionally by impacts or by episodes of enhanced
volcanism. These latter hypotheses struggle to produce the amounts of rainfall
needed to form the martian valleys, but are consistent with inferred low rates
of weathering compared to Earth. Here, we provide a geophysical mechanism that
could have induced cycles of glaciation and deglaciation on early Mars. Our
model produces dramatic climate cycles with extended periods of glaciation
punctuated by warm periods lasting up to 10 Myr, much longer than those
generated in other episodic warming models. The cycles occur because stellar
insolation was low, and because CO2 outgassing is not able to keep pace with
CO2 consumption by silicate weathering followed by deposition of carbonates.
While CO2 by itself is not able to deglaciate early Mars in our model, we
assume that the greenhouse effect is enhanced by substantial amounts of H2
outgassed from Mars' reduced crust and mantle. Our hypothesis can be tested by
future Mars exploration that better establishes the time scale for valley
formation.

biochemical signaling and mechanical stimuli. Early models of the biological
aspects of remodeling were non-spatial and focused on the local dynamics at a
fixed location in the bone. Several spatial extensions of these models have
been proposed, but they generally suffer from two limitations: first, they are
not amenable to analysis and are computationally expensive, and second, they
neglect the role played by bone-embedded osteocytes. To address these issues,
we developed a novel model of spatial remodeling based on the principles of
evolutionary game theory. The analytically tractable framework describes the
spatial interactions between zones of bone resorption, bone formation and
quiescent bone, and explicitly accounts for regulation of remodeling by
bone-embedded, mechanotransducing osteocytes. Using tools from the theory of
interacting particle systems we systematically classified the different dynamic
regimes of the spatial model and identified regions of parameter space that
allow for coexistence of resorption, formation and quiescence, as observed in
physiological remodeling. In coexistence scenarios, three-dimensional
simulations revealed the emergence of sponge-like bone clusters. Comparison
between spatial and non-spatial dynamics revealed substantial differences and
suggested a stabilizing role of space. Our findings emphasize the importance of
accounting for spatial structure and bone-embedded osteocytes when modeling the
process of bone remodeling. Thanks to the lattice-based framework, the proposed
model can easily be coupled to a mechanical model of bone loading.

the latter we only cover >50% of the error region for approximately 5% of

increasing to about 1 Jy for a wider range of events. This corresponds to
luminosity limits of 1e38-1e39 erg/s based on expectations for the distances of
the gravitational wave transients, which should be sufficient to detect or

connected devices (things) which are constantly recording data from their

to the cloud at a very high rate, leading to high storage and analysis costs.
In order to ameliorate these costs, we can analyse the data as it arrives in a
stream to learn about the underlying process, perform interpolation and
smoothing and make forecasts and predictions.
  Conventional tools of state space modelling assume data on a fixed regular
time grid. However, many sensors change their sampling frequency, sometimes
adaptively, or get interrupted and re-started out of sync with the previous
sampling grid, or just generate event data at irregular times. It is therefore
desirable to model the system as a partially and irregularly observed Markov
process which evolves in continuous time. Both the process and the observation
model are potentially non-linear. Particle filters therefore represent the
simplest approach to online analysis. A functional Scala library of composable
continuous time Markov process models has been developed in order to model the

electromagnetic field, a special Wald vacuum solution (WVS) has been found in
the case of no-source uniform field. For WVS, the Meissner effect (ME) occurs
only in the the extreme KBH where $M^2/J=1$, in this case, the magnetic field
is totally excluded from the event horizon (EH) of KBH. However, WVS does not
consider the Hawking radiation (HR) but treats KBH as an absolutely black body.
If HR is added , researchers believe that the condition is not so restricted
and it is possible for ME to occur in less extreme case. How less is the ""less
extreme case""? This paper tries to answer this question. Since the Hawking
temperature $T_H$ of KBH defined by HR is proportional to the surface gravity
$\kappa$ at the EH, this question is actually about the so-called
existence/non-existence of ME (ME/NME) or superconducting phase transition. In
this paper, we study the connection between the superconductivity of KBH-EH and
the existence of Weyl Fermion (WF). Using thermodynamic formulas and the KBH
state equation, we prove that the inherent-parameter condition for ME to occur
is $M^2/J\leq \epsilon_c=1.5$ in force-free fields whether it be in the simple
axisymmetric vacuum zero source case or in the non-zero source case which can
be described by the nonlinear Grad-Shafranov (G-S) equation. We suggest that
this is a second-order phase transition and we calculate the critical exponents
$\delta=1$ and $\eta=1/2$ for the specific heat diverging at constant $J$, and
the critical point $(M_c, \Omega_c)$, which equals $(1.22\sqrt{ J}, 0.16/\sqrt{

Miuz measures the impact of disconnecting a node from the network while
comparing the sizes of the remaining connected components. Strictly speaking,
Miuz for a node is defined as the inverse of the size of the largest connected
component divided by the sum of the sizes of the remaining ones. We tested our
index in attack strategies where the nodes are disconnected in decreasing order
of a specified metric. We considered Miuz and other well-known centrality
measures such as betweenness, degree , and harmonic centrality. All of these
metrics were compared regarding the behavior of the robust-ness (R-index)
during the attacks. In an attempt to simulate the internet backbone, the
attacks were performed in complex networks with power-law degree distributions
(scale-free networks). Preliminary results show that attacks based on
disconnecting a few number of nodes Miuz are more dangerous (decreasing the
robustness) than the same attacks based on other centrality measures. We
believe that Miuz, as well as other measures based on the size of the largest
connected component, provides a good addition to other robustness metrics for
complex networks.

qualitative behavior is independent on $n$. The critical point is calculated
for strong and for weak noise, these limits are also bounds for the critical
point. Introducing an additional nonlinearity, such that the potential can have
up to three minima, leads to richer behavior. There the parameter space divides
in three regions, a region with a symmetric phase, a region with a phase of
broken symmetry and a region where both phases coexist. The region of
coexistence collapses into one of the others via a discontinuous phase
transition whereas the transition between the symmetric phase and the phase of

intersect, can be calculated for strong and for weak noise. These limiting
values form optimal bounds on the tricritical point. In the region of

  magnetization dynamics of Au/GdFeCo bilayers","3 Figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The temperature evolution of GdFeCo electrons following optical heating plays
a key role in all optical switching of GdFeCo and is primarily governed by the
strength of coupling between electrons and phonons. Typically, the strength of
electron-phonon coupling in a metal is deduced by monitoring changes in
reflectance following optical heating and then analyzing the transient
reflectance with a simple two-temperature thermal model. In a magnetic metal,
the change in reflectance cannot be assumed to depend only the electron and
phonon temperatures because a metal's reflectance also depends on the
magnetization. To deduce the electron-phonon coupling constant in GdFeCo, we
analyze thermal transport in Au and GdFeCo bilayers following optical heating
of the GdFeCo electrons. We use the reflectance of the Au layer to monitor the
temperature evolution of the Au phonons. By interpreting the response of the
bilayer to heating with a thermal model, we determine the electron-phonon
coupling constant in GdFeCo to be 6 x 10^17 W/(m^3-K) corresponding to an
electron-phonon relaxation time in GdFeCo of ~150 fs.

chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) with and without the explicit $\Delta$ isobar
contributions, we calculate the energy per particle of symmetric nuclear matter
and pure neutron matter in the framework of the microscopic
Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approach. In particular, we present for the first time
nuclear matter calculations using the new fully local in coordinate-space
two-nucleon interaction at the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-order (N3LO) of
ChPT with $\Delta$ isobar intermediate states (N3LO$\Delta$) recently developed
by Piarulli et al. [arXiv:1606:06335]. We find that using this N3LO$\Delta$
potential, supplemented with a local N2LO three-nucleon interaction with
explicit $\Delta$ isobar degrees of freedom, it is possible to obtain a
satisfactory saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter. For this combination
of two- and three-nucleon interactions we also calculate the nuclear symmetry
energy and we compare our results with the empirical constraints on this
quantity obtained using the excitation energies to isobaric analog states in
nuclei and using experimental data on the neutron skin thickness of heavy
nuclei, finding a very good agreement with these empirical constraints in all
the considered nucleonic density range. In addition, we find that the explicit
inclusion of $\Delta$ isobars diminishes the strength of the three-nucleon
interactions needed the get a good saturation point of symmetric nuclear
matter. We also compare the results of our calculations with those obtained by
other research groups using chiral nuclear interactions with different
many-body methods, finding in many cases a very satisfactory agreement.

observations with a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer at the 6-m SAO RAS
telescope. We compare the structure and kinematics of ionized gas with that of
atomic hydrogen and with the stellar population of the SGS. Our deep H$\alpha$
images and archival images taken by the HST demonstrate that current star
formation episodes are larger and more complicated than previously thought:
they represent unified star-forming complexes with sizes of several hundred pc
rather than 'chains' of separate bright nebulae in the walls of the SGS. The
fact that we are dealing with unified complexes is evidenced by identified
faint shell-like structures of ionized and neutral gas which connect several
distinct bright HII regions. Formation of such complexes is due to the feedback
of stars with very inhomogeneous ambient gas in the walls of the SGS. The
arguments supporting an idea about the triggering of star formation in SGS by
the HI supershells collision are presented. We also found a faint ionized
supershell inside the HI SGS expanding with a velocity of no greater than 10-15
km/s. Five OB stars located inside the inner supershell are sufficient to
account for its radiation, although a possibility of leakage of ionizing
photons from bright HII regions is not ruled out as well.

a simulation approach which is typically used for stochastic differential
equation models - can be applied in reliability problems by carefully
controlling the bias-variance tradeoff in approximating large system behaviour.
In this first exposition of MLMC methods in reliability problems we address the
canonical problem of estimating the expectation of a functional of system
lifetime and show the computational advantages compared to classical Monte
Carlo methods. The difference in computational complexity can be orders of
magnitude for very large or complicated system structures.

  Trade-off","Appears in the Proceedings of the 24th International Symposium on
  Graph Drawing and Network Visualization (GD 2016)",,,,"cs.CG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bundling of graph edges (node-to-node connections) is a common technique to
enhance visibility of overall trends in the edge structure of a large graph
layout, and a large variety of bundling algorithms have been proposed. However,
with strong bundling, it becomes hard to identify origins and destinations of
individual edges. We propose a solution: we optimize edge coloring to
differentiate bundled edges. We quantify strength of bundling in a flexible
pairwise fashion between edges, and among bundled edges, we quantify how
dissimilar their colors should be by dissimilarity of their origins and
destinations. We solve the resulting nonlinear optimization, which is also
interpretable as a novel dimensionality reduction task. In large graphs the
necessary compromise is whether to differentiate colors sharply between locally
occurring strongly bundled edges (""local bundles""), or also between the weakly
bundled edges occurring globally over the graph (""global bundles""); we allow a
user-set global-local tradeoff. We call the technique ""peacock bundles"".
Experiments show the coloring clearly enhances comprehensibility of graph
layouts with edge bundling.

Kinks are not rounded off, but may be straightened out. This means that back
reaction will only cause loops with kinks to develop cusps after some
potentially large fraction of their lifetimes. In some loops, symmetries
prevent even this process, so that the loop evaporates in a self-similar
fashion and the kinks are unchanged. As an example, we discuss back-reaction on
the rectangular Garfinkle-Vachaspati loop.

a new cycloidal fractal signature possessing the cardioid shape in the

the true solution for an accurate assessment of the voltage collapse margin.
This feature distinguishes the framework from all iterative and non-iterative
heuristic approaches as demonstrated in the context of a 7-bus network with
Newton-Raphson, its variants and semidefinite and moment-based relaxations of
power flow. Another important feature of this framework is that it obtains the
true solution when it exists and declares its non-existence otherwise. This is
demonstrated in the context of small networks and in comparison with heuristic
approaches. This paper also explores how the proposed framework detects a
limit-induced bifurcation where a network controller reaching its limit can
initiate voltage collapse.

value of $c$. Furthermore, a numerical approach for finding the optimal value
of the convergence-control parameter is given. At the same time, it is found
that the traditional Adomian decomposition method is only a special case of the
new method. The effectiveness and applicability of the new technique are
demonstrated by several physical models including nonlinear heat transfer

and dispersive waves. Moreover, the ideas proposed in this paper may offer us
