content-based retrieval has emerged as a significant research area. Shapes,
textures, edges and segments may play a key role in describing the content of
an image. Radon and Gabor transforms are both powerful techniques that have
been widely studied to extract shape-texture-based information. The combined
Radon-Gabor features may be more robust against scale/rotation variations,
presence of noise, and illumination changes. The objective of this paper is to
harness the potentials of both Gabor and Radon transforms in order to introduce
expressive binary features, called barcodes, for image annotation/tagging
tasks. We propose two different techniques: Gabor-of-Radon-Image Barcodes
(GRIBCs), and Guided-Radon-of-Gabor Barcodes (GRGBCs). For validation, we
employ the IRMA x-ray dataset with 193 classes, containing 12,677 training

achieved for GRGBCs and GRIBCs, respectively. This corresponds to $\approx

evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement agents and neural networks using
""opposition-based learning"" (OBL). Two types of the ""opposites"" have been
defined in the literature, namely \textit{type-I} and \textit{type-II}. The
former are linear in nature and applicable to the variable space, hence easy to
calculate. On the other hand, type-II opposites capture the ""oppositeness"" in
the output space. In fact, type-I opposites are considered a special case of
type-II opposites where inputs and outputs have a linear relationship. However,
in many real-world problems, inputs and outputs do in fact exhibit a nonlinear
relationship. Therefore, type-II opposites are expected to be better in
capturing the sense of ""opposition"" in terms of the input-output relation. In
the absence of any knowledge about the problem at hand, there seems to be no
intuitive way to calculate the type-II opposites. In this paper, we introduce
an approach to learn type-II opposites from the given inputs and their outputs
using the artificial neural networks (ANNs). We first perform \emph{opposition
mining} on the sample data, and then use the mined data to learn the
relationship between input $x$ and its opposite $\breve{x}$. We have validated
our algorithm using various benchmark functions to compare it against an
evolving fuzzy inference approach that has been recently introduced. The
results show the better performance of a neural approach to learn the
opposites. This will create new possibilities for integrating oppositional
schemes within existing algorithms promising a potential increase in
convergence speed and/or accuracy.

ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ over a field $K$ of arbitrary characteristic. On the ring
$M_{m,n}$ of $m\times n$ matrices $A$ with entries in $R$ we consider several
equivalence relations given by the action on $M_{m,n}$ of a group $G$. $G$ can
be the group of automorphisms of $R$, combined with the multiplication of
invertible matrices from the left, from the right, or from both sides,
respectively. We call $A$ finitely $G$-determined if $A$ is $G$-equivalent to
any matrix $B$ with ${A-B} \in {\mathfrak{m}^k M_{m,n}}$ for some finite
integer $k$, which implies in particular that $A$ is $G$--equivalent to a
matrix with polynomial entries.
  The classical criterion for analytic or differential map germs $f:(K^s,0) \to
(K^m,0)$, $K = \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}$, says that $f \in M_{m,1}$ is finitely
determined (with respect to various group actions) iff the tangent space to the
orbit of $f$ has finite codimension in $M_{m,1}$. We extend this criterion to
arbitrary matrices in $M_{m,n}$ if the characteristic of K is 0 or, more
general, if the orbit map is separable. In positive characteristic however, the
problem is more subtle since the orbit map is in general not separable, as we
show by an example. This fact had been overlooked in previous papers. Our main
result is a general sufficient criterion for finite $G$-determinacy in
$M_{m,n}$ in arbitrary characteristic in terms of the tangent image of the
orbit map, which we introduce in this paper. This criterion provides a
computable bound for the $G$-determinacy of a matrix $A$ in $M_{m,n}$, which is
new even in characteristic 0.

initialized to a preset value. Next in Phase 2, the inputs are evaluated to
switch the output magnet to its correct value. The time window for the output
to switch in Phase 2 is fixed. Using such a scheme, an n-input AND gate which
requires a total of (2n-1) inputs in the conventional implementation can now be
implemented with only (n+1) inputs. When applied to standard logic functions,
it is demonstrated that the proposed method of designing ASL gates are 1.6-3.4X

Steklov spectrum in terms of only boundary data. As a consequence, we prove
that the Steklov spectrum detects the presence and number of orbifold
singularities on the boundary of an orbisurface and it detects the number each
of smooth and singular boundary components. Moreover, we find that the Steklov
spectrum also determines the lengths of the boundary components modulo an
equivalence relation, and we show by examples that this result is the best
possible. We construct various examples of Steklov isospectral Riemannian
orbifolds which demonstrate that these two-dimensional results do not extend to
higher dimensions. In addition, we give two-dimensional examples which show
that the Steklov spectrum does \emph{not} detect the presence of interior
singularities nor does it determine the orbifold Euler characteristic. In fact,
a flat disk is Steklov isospectral to a cone.
  In another direction, we obtain upper bounds on the Steklov eigenvalues of a
Riemannian orbifold in terms of the isoperimetric ratio and a conformal
invariant. We generalize results of B. Colbois, A. El Soufi and A. Girouard,

solution is always global and bounded in $H^1$. This equation has a family of
solitons, and our goal is to classify the dynamics near soliton. Together with
a suitable decay assumption, there are only three possibilities: (i) the
solution converges asymptotically to a solitary wave, whose $H^1$ norm is of
size $\gamma^{-2/(q-1)}$, as $\gamma\rightarrow0$; (ii) the solution is always
in a small neighborhood of the modulated family of solitary waves, but blows
down at $+\infty$; (iii) the solution leaves any small neighborhood of the
modulated family of the solitary waves. This extends the classification of the
rigidity dynamics near the ground state for the unperturbed $L^2$ critical gKdV
(corresponding to $\gamma=0$) by Martel, Merle and Rapha\""el. However, the
blow-down behavior (ii) is completely new, and the dynamics of the saturated

exploitation has previously only been tackled through two paradigmatic limiting
models---patch-use and random search---that do not account for the interplay
between searcher motion within patches and resource depletion. Here, we bridge
this gap by introducing a minimal patch exploitation model that incorporates
this coupling: the searcher depletes the resources along its random-walk
trajectory within a patch and travels to a new patch after it takes
$\mathcal{S}$ consecutive steps without finding resources. We compute the
distribution of the amount of resources $F_t$ consumed by time $t$ for this
non-Markovian random walker and show that exploring multiple patches is
beneficial. In one dimension, we analytically derive the optimal strategy to
maximize $F_t$. We show that this strategy is robust with respect to the
distribution of resources within patches and the criterion for leaving a given
patch. We also show that $F_t$ can be optimized in the ecologically-relevant
case of two-dimensional patchy environments.

to supergranulation, the largest distinct spatial scale of convection observed
in the solar photosphere. While supergranulation is only weakly influenced by
rotation, larger spatial scales of convection sample the deep convection zone
and are presumably rotationally influenced. We present numerical results from a
series of nonlinear, 3-D simulations of rotating convection and examine the
velocity power distribution realized under a range of Rossby numbers. When
rotation is present, the convective power distribution possesses a pronounced
peak, at characteristic wavenumber $\ell_\mathrm{peak}$, whose value increases
as the Rossby number is decreased. This distribution of power contrasts with
that realized in non-rotating convection, where power increases monotonically
from high to low wavenumbers. We find that spatial scales smaller than
$\ell_\mathrm{peak}$ behave in analogy to non-rotating convection. Spatial
scales larger than $\ell_\mathrm{peak}$ are rotationally-constrained and
possess substantially reduced power relative to the non-rotating system. We
argue that the supergranular scale emerges due to a suppression of power on
spatial scales larger than $\ell\approx100$ owing to the presence of deep,
rotationally-constrained convection. Supergranulation thus represents the
largest non-rotationally-constrained mode of solar convection. We conclude that
the characteristic spatial scale of supergranulation bounds that of the deep
convective motions from above, making supergranulation an indirect measure of
the deep-seated dynamics at work in the solar dynamo. Using the spatial scale
of supergranulation in conjunction with our numerical results, we estimate an
upper bound of 10 m s$^{-1}$ for the Sun's bulk rms convective velocity.

the HI up to very high redshift and therefore reveal us something about the
evolution of the large scale structures in the Universe. However little is
known about the abundance and clustering properties of the HI over cosmic time.
Motivated by this, we build an analytic framework where the relevant parameters
that govern how the HI is distributed among dark matter halos can be fixed
using observations. At the same time we provide tools to study the column
density distribution function of the HI absorbers together with their
clustering properties. Our formalism is the first one able to account for all
observations at a single redshift, $z = 2.3$. The linear bias of the HI and the
mean number density of HI sources, two main ingredients in the calculation of
the signal-to-noise ratio of a cosmological survey, are then discussed in
detail, also extrapolating the results to low and high redshift. We find that
HI bias is relatively higher than the value reported in similar studies, but
the shot noise level is always sub dominant, making the HI Power Spectrum

the super-resolution (SR) operation is performed in HR space. We demonstrate
that this is sub-optimal and adds computational complexity. In this paper, we
present the first convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of real-time SR of
1080p videos on a single K2 GPU. To achieve this, we propose a novel CNN
architecture where the feature maps are extracted in the LR space. In addition,
we introduce an efficient sub-pixel convolution layer which learns an array of
upscaling filters to upscale the final LR feature maps into the HR output. By
doing so, we effectively replace the handcrafted bicubic filter in the SR
pipeline with more complex upscaling filters specifically trained for each
feature map, whilst also reducing the computational complexity of the overall
SR operation. We evaluate the proposed approach using images and videos from
publicly available datasets and show that it performs significantly better

distribution in dust clouds that form in three-dimensional (3D) complex plasmas
under microgravity conditions. The method utilizes the data obtained during the
3D scanning of a cloud and provides a reasonably good accuracy. Based on this
method, we investigate the particle density in a dust cloud realized in gas
discharge plasma in the PK-3 Plus setup onboard the International Space
Station. We find that the treated dust clouds are both anisotropic and
inhomogeneous. One can isolate two regimes, in which a stationary dust cloud
can be observed. At low pressures, the particle density decreases monotonically
with the increase of the distance from the discharge center; at higher
pressures, the density distribution has a shallow minimum. Regardless of the
regime, we detect a cusp of the distribution at the void boundary and a slowly
varying density at larger distances (in the foot region). A theoretical
interpretation of obtained results is developed that leads to reasonable
estimates of the densities for both the cusp and foot. The modified ionization
equation of state, which allows for violation of the local quasineutrality in
the cusp region, predicts the spatial distributions of ion and electron
densities to be measured in future experiments.

all-optical communication. Several nanolasers smaller than the diffraction
limit have been theoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated using
plasmonic cavities to confine optical fields. Such compact cavities exhibit
large Purcell factors, thereby enhancing spontaneous emission, which feeds into
the lasing mode. However, most plasmonic nanolasers reported so far have
employed resonant nanostructures and therefore had the lasing restricted to the
proximity of the resonance wavelength. Here, we report on an approach based on
gold nanorod hyperbolic metamaterials for lasing. Hyperbolic metamaterials
provide broadband Purcell enhancement due to large photonic density of optical
states, while also supporting surface plasmon modes to deliver optical feedback
for lasing due to nonlocal effects in nanorod media. We experimentally
demonstrate the advantage of hyperbolic metamaterials in achieving lasing
action by its comparison with that obtained in a metamaterial with elliptic
dispersion. The conclusions from the experimental results are supported with
numerical simulations comparing the Purcell factors and surface plasmon modes
for the metamaterials with different dispersions. We show that although the
metamaterials of both types support lasing, emission with hyperbolic samples is
about twice as strong with 35% lower threshold vs. the elliptic ones. Hence,
hyperbolic metamaterials can serve as a convenient platform of choice for
nanoscale coherent photon sources in a broad wavelength range.

$R_{AA}$ as well as the elliptic and triangular flow harmonics at high $p_T$ in
PbPb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. In fact, the presence of a finite
triangular flow as well as cumulants of the flow harmonic distribution that
differ from the mean are only possible when these event-by-event fluctuations
are considered. In this paper we combine event-by-event viscous hydrodynamics
and jet quenching to make predictions for high $p_T$ $R_{AA}$, $v_2\{2\}$,
$v_3\{2\}$, and $v_2\{4\}$ in PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. With
an order of magnitude larger statistics we find that high $p_T$ elliptic flow
does not scale linearly with the soft elliptical flow, as originally thought,
but has deviations from perfectly linear scaling. A new experimental
observable, which involves the difference between the ratio of harmonic flow
cumulants at high and low $p_T$, is proposed to investigate the fluctuations of
high $p_T$ flow harmonics and measure this nonlinear response. By varying the
path length dependence of the energy loss and the viscosity of the evolving
medium we find that $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_2\{2\}(p_T)$ strongly depend on the
choice for the path length dependence of the energy loss, which can be
constrained using the new LHC run 2 data.

local value of the Hubble constant H_0. The Cepheid distances are estimated
from a recent calibration of the near-infrared Period-Luminosity P-L relation.
The comparison is carried out in parallax space, where the DR1 parallax errors,
with a median value of half the median parallax, are expected to be
well-behaved. With the exception of one outlier, the DR1 parallaxes are in
remarkably good global agreement with the predictions, and the published errors
may be conservatively overestimated by about 20%. The parallaxes of 9 Cepheids
brighter than G = 6 may be systematically underestimated, trigonometric
parallaxes measured with the HST FGS for three of these objects confirm this
trend. If interpreted as an independent calibration of the Cepheid luminosities
and assumed to be otherwise free of systematic uncertainties, DR1 parallaxes
would imply a decrease of 0.3% in the current estimate of the local Hubble
constant, well within their statistical uncertainty, and corresponding to a
value 2.5 sigma (3.5 sigma if the errors are scaled) higher than the value
inferred from Planck CMB data used in conjunction with Lambda-CDM. We also test
for a zeropoint error in Gaia parallaxes and find none to a precision of ~20
muas. We caution however that with this early release, the complete systematic
properties of the measurements may not be fully understood at the statistical
level of the Cepheid sample mean, a level an order of magnitude below the
individual uncertainties. The early results from DR1 demonstrate again the
enormous impact that the full mission will likely have on fundamental questions
in astrophysics and cosmology.

pollution generated locally and pollution traveling long distances in the
atmosphere. Therefore, the identification of spatial scales associated with
health effects can inform on pollution sources responsible for these effects,
resulting in more targeted regulatory policy. Recently, prediction methods that
yield high-resolution spatial estimates of PM2.5 exposures allow one to
evaluate such scale-specific associations. We propose a two-dimensional wavelet
decomposition that alleviates restrictive assumptions required for standard
wavelet decompositions. Using this method we decompose daily surfaces of PM2.5
to identify which scales of pollution are most associated with adverse health
outcomes. A key feature of the approach is that it can remove the purely
temporal component of variability in PM2.5 levels and calculate effect
estimates derived solely from spatial contrasts. This eliminates the potential
for unmeasured confounding of the exposure - outcome associations by temporal
factors, such as season. We apply our method to a study of birth weights in
Massachusetts, U.S.A from 2003-2008 and find that both local and urban sources
of pollution are strongly negatively associated with birth weight. Results also
suggest that failure to eliminate temporal confounding in previous analyses
attenuated the overall effect estimate towards zero, with the effect estimate
growing in magnitude once this source of variability is removed.

increase the power factor or reduce the phonon conductance, or even both. In
graphene, the high phonon thermal conductivity is the main factor limiting the
thermoelectric conversion. The common strategy to enhance ZT is therefore to
introduce phonon scatterers to suppress the phonon conductance while retaining
high electrical conductance and Seebeck coefficient. Although thermoelectric
performance is eventually enhanced, all studies based on this strategy show a
significant reduction of the electrical conductance, most often leading to a
lower electronic performance. In this study we show that appropriate sources of
disorder, including isotopes and vacancies at lowest electron density
positions, can be used as phonon scatterers to reduce the phonon conductance in
graphene ribbons without degrading the electrical conductance, particularly in
the low-energy region which is the most important range for device operation.
By means of atomistic calculations using semi-empirical Tight-Binding and Force
Constant models in combination with Non-Equilibrium Green function formalism,
we show that the natural electronic properties of graphene ribbons can be fully
preserved while their thermoelectric efficiency is strongly enhanced. For
ribbons of width M = 5 dimer lines, room-temperature ZT is enhanced from less
than 0.26 for defect-free ribbons to more than 2.5. This study is likely to set
the milestones of a new generation of nano-devices with dual electronic,

to accretion rates. Increasing this ratio has three effects: First, the
protostar grows slower with a lower luminosity at any given time, lowering
radiative feedback. Second, bipolar cavities cleared by the outflow are larger,
further diminishing radiative feedback on disk and core scales. Third, the

decreasing the protostar's potential mass reservoir via entrainment. The star
formation efficiency varies with the ratio of ejection to accretion rates from
50% in the case of very weak outflows to as low as 20% for very strong
outflows. At latitudes between the low density bipolar cavity and the high
density accretion disk, wide angle disk winds remove some of the gas, which
otherwise would be part of the accretion flow onto the disk; varying the
strength of these wide angle disk winds, however, alters the final star
formation efficiency by only +/-6%. For all cases, the opening angle of the
bipolar outflow cavity remains below 20 degree during early protostellar
accretion phases, increasing rapidly up to 65 degree at the onset of radiation
pressure feedback.

nonminimal coupling $\xi \phi^2R$ and quartic potential $\lambda \phi^4/4$ for
several cases: real scalar inflaton, complex scalar inflaton and Abelian Higgs
inflaton. We point out that the preheating proceeds much more violently than
previously thought. If the inflaton is a complex scalar, the phase degree of
freedom is violently produced at the first stage of preheating. If the inflaton
is a Higgs field, the longitudinal gauge boson production is similarly violent.
This is caused by a spike-like feature in the time dependence of the inflaton
field, which may be understood as a consequence of the short time scale during
which the effective potential or kinetic term changes suddenly. The produced
particles typically have very high momenta $k \lesssim
\sqrt{\lambda}M_\text{P}$. The production might be so strong that almost all
the energy of the inflaton is carried away within one oscillation for
$\xi^2\lambda \gtrsim {\mathcal O}(100)$. This may partly change the
conventional understandings of the (p)reheating after inflation with the
nonminimal coupling to gravity such as Higgs inflation. We also discuss the
possibility of unitarity violation at the preheating stage.

Seyfert galaxy Ark 120, jointly carried out in 2014 with XMM-Newton, Chandra,
and NuSTAR. The fortunate line of sight to this source, devoid of any
significant absorbing material, provides an incomparably clean view to the
nuclear regions of an active galaxy. Here we focus on the analysis of the iron
fluorescence features, which form a composite emission pattern in the 6$-$7 keV
band. The prominent K$\alpha$ line from neutral iron at 6.4 keV is resolved in
the Chandra High-Energy Transmission Grating spectrum to a full-width at half
maximum of 4700$^{+2700}_{-1500}$ km s$^{-1}$, consistent with an origin from
the optical broad-line region. Excess components are detected on both sides of
the narrow K$\alpha$ line: the red one (6.0$-$6.3 keV) clearly varies in
strength in about one year, and hints at the presence of a broad, mildly
asymmetric line from the accretion disk; the blue one (6.5$-$7.0 keV), instead,
is likely a blend of different contributions, and appears to be constant when
integrated over long enough exposures. However, the Fe K excess emission map
computed over the 7.5 days of the XMM-Newton monitoring shows that both the red
and the blue features are actually highly variable on timescales of
$\sim$10$-$15 hours, suggesting that they might arise from short-lived hotspots
on the disk surface, located within a few tens of gravitational radii from the
central supermassive black hole and possibly illuminated by magnetic
reconnection events. Any alternative explanation would still require a highly
dynamic, inhomogeneous disk/coronal system, involving clumpiness and/or
instability.

Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on Gemini South. The targets of SPT-GMOS are
galaxy clusters identified in the SPT-SZ survey, a millimeter-wave survey of
2500 squ. deg. of the southern sky using the South Pole Telescope (SPT).
Multi-object spectroscopic observations of 62 SPT-selected galaxy clusters were
performed between January 2011 and December 2015, yielding spectra with radial
velocity measurements for 2595 sources. We identify 2243 of these sources as
galaxies, and 352 as stars. Of the galaxies, we identify 1579 as members of
SPT-SZ galaxy clusters. The primary goal of these observations was to obtain
spectra of cluster member galaxies to estimate cluster redshifts and velocity
dispersions. We describe the full spectroscopic dataset and resulting data
products, including galaxy redshifts, cluster redshifts and velocity
dispersions, and measurements of several well-known spectral indices for each
galaxy: the equivalent width, W, of [O II] 3727,3729 and H-delta, and the 4000A
break strength, D4000. We use the spectral indices to classify galaxies by
spectral type (i.e., passive, post-starburst, star-forming), and we match the
spectra against photometric catalogs to characterize spectroscopically-observed
cluster members as a function of brightness (relative to m*). Finally, we
report several new measurements of redshifts for ten bright, strongly-lensed
background galaxies in the cores of eight galaxy clusters. Combining the
SPT-GMOS dataset with previous spectroscopic follow-up of SPT-SZ galaxy
clusters results in spectroscopic measurements for >100 clusters, or ~20% of
the full SPT-SZ sample.

the largest known population of $\gamma$-ray sources and their number is
continuously growing in the Fermi catalogs. However in the latest release of
the Fermi catalog there is still a large fraction of sources that are
classified as blazar candidate of uncertain type (BCUs) for which optical
spectroscopic observations are necessary to confirm their nature and their
associations. In addition about 1/3 of the $\gamma$-ray point sources listed in
the Third Fermi-LAT Source Catalog (3FGL) are still unassociated and lacking an
assigned lower energy counterpart. Since 2012 we have been carrying out an
optical spectroscopic campaign to observe blazar candidates to confirm their
nature. In this paper, the sixth of the series, we present optical
spectroscopic observations for 30 $\gamma$-ray blazar candidates from different
observing programs we carried out with the TNG, WHT, OAN, SOAR and Magellan
telescopes. We found that 21 out of 30 sources investigated are BL Lac objects
while the remaining targets are classified as flat spectrum radio quasars
showing the typical broad emission lines of normal quasi stellar objects. We
conclude that our selection of $\gamma$-ray blazars candidates based on their
multifrequency properties continues to be a successful way to discover
potential low-energy counterparts of the FermiUnidentified Gamma-ray Sources
(UGSs) and to confirm the nature of BCUs.

populations of Milky Way-sized galaxies using the APOSTLE cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations of the Local Group. In agreement with earlier work,
we find strong radial gradients in the fraction of the oldest (tform < 0.8 Gyr)
and most metal poor ([Fe/H]< -2.5) stars, both of which increase outwards. The
most metal poor stars form over an extended period of time; half of them form
after z = 5.3, and the last 10% after z = 2.8. The age of the metal poor
stellar population also shows significant variation with environment; a high
fraction of them are old in the galaxy's central regions and an even higher
fraction in some individual dwarf galaxies, with substantial scatter from dwarf
to dwarf. Overall, over half of the stars that belong to both the oldest and
most metal-poor population are found outside the solar circle. Somewhat
counter-intuitively, we find that dwarf galaxies with a large fraction of metal
poor stars that are very old are systems where metal poor stars are relatively
rare, but where a substantial old population is present. Our results provide
guidance for interpreting the results of surveys designed to hunt for the
earliest and most pristine stellar component of our Milky Way.

$K$ and $B$ meson decays, but not yet in any baryon decay. Such differences are
associated with the non-invariance of fundamental interactions under the
combined charge-conjugation and parity transformations, known as $C\!P$
violation. Using data from the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, a
search is made for $C\!P$-violating asymmetries in the decay angle
distributions of $\Lambda^0_b$ baryons decaying to $p\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ and
$p\pi^-K^+K^-$ final states. These four-body hadronic decays are a promising
place to search for sources of $C\!P$ violation both within and beyond the
Standard Model of particle physics. We find evidence for $C\!P$ violation in
$\Lambda^0_b$ to $p\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ decays with a statistical significance
corresponding to 3.3 standard deviations including systematic uncertainties.
This represents the first evidence for $C\!P$ violation in the baryon sector.

interpretation through simulations. Physical properties of the interplanetary
dust in the near-ecliptic symmetry surface, such as the local polarization,
temperature and composition, together with their heliocentric variations, may
be derived from scattered and emitted light observations, giving clues to the
respective contribution of the particles sources. A model of light scattering
by a cloud of solid particles constituted by spheroidal grains and aggregates
thereof is used to interpret the local light scattering data. Equilibrium
temperature of the same particles allows us to interpret the temperature
heliocentric variations. A good fit of the local polarization phase curve,
$P_{\alpha}$, near 1.5~AU from the Sun is obtained for a mixture of silicates
and more absorbing organics material ($\approx$40 % in mass) and for a
realistic size distribution typical of the interplanetary dust in the 0.2 to

origin is at least 20% in mass. The same size distribution of particles gives a
solar distance, $R$, dependence of the temperature in $R^{-0.45}$ different
than the typical black body behavior. The heliocentric dependence of

degree of uncertainty for speech recognition, the retrieval results can be very

to obtain better retrieval results before showing to the user. The suitable
actions depend on the retrieval status, for example requesting for extra

In our previous work, some hand-crafted states estimated from the present

propose to use Deep-Q-Learning techniques instead to determine the machine
actions for interactive spoken content retrieval. Deep-Q-Learning bypasses the

layers on oxide surfaces. We present a chemical vapor deposition method to
pattern mica surfaces with regions of high-quality aminosilane
(3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, APTES) monolayers. The approach relies on the
vapor deposition of an aminosilane through a patterned array of through-holes
in a PDMS (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) membrane that acts as a mask. In aqueous
solutions the surfaces have regular patterns of charge heterogeneities with
minimal topographical variations over large areas. This versatile dry lift-off
deposition method alleviates issues with multilayer formation and can be used
to create charge patterns on curved surfaces. We identify the necessary steps
to achieve high quality monolayers and charge reversal of the underlying mica
surface: 1) hexane extraction to remove unreacted PDMS oligomers from the
membrane that would otherwise deposit on and contaminate the substrate, 2)
oxygen plasma treatment of the top of the membrane surfaces to generate a
barrier layer that blocks APTES transport through the PDMS, and 3) decrease of
the vapor pressure of APTES during deposition to minimize APTES condensation at
the mica-membrane-vapor contact lines and to prevent multilayer formation.
Under these conditions, AFM imaging shows that the monolayers have a height of
0.9nm with an increase in height up to 3nm at the mica-membrane-vapor contact

operating under uncertain environments. Much of the prior work on achieving
robust and safe control requires solving second-order cone programs (SOCP).
Unfortunately, existing general purpose SOCP methods are often infeasible for
real-time robotic tasks due to high memory and computational requirements
imposed by existing general optimization methods. The key contribution of this
paper is a fast and memory-efficient algorithm for SOCP that would enable
robust and safe mission planning on-board robots in real-time. Our algorithm
does not have any external dependency, can efficiently utilize warm start
provided in safe planning settings, and in fact leads to significant speed up
over standard optimization packages (like SDPT3) for even standard SOCP
problems. For example, for a standard quadrotor problem, our method leads to
speedup of 1000x over SDPT3 without any deterioration in the solution quality.
  Our method is based on two insights: a) SOCPs can be interpreted as
optimizing a function over a polytope with infinite sides, b) a linear function
can be efficiently optimized over this polytope. We combine the above
observations with a novel utilization of Wolfe's algorithm to obtain an
efficient optimization method that can be easily implemented on small embedded
devices. In addition to the above mentioned algorithm, we also design a
two-level sensing method based on Gaussian Process for complex obstacles with
non-linear boundaries such as a cylinder.

In this paper, we propose a Select-Additive Learning (SAL) procedure that
improves the generalizability of trained neural networks for multimodal

prediction accuracy significantly in all three modalities (verbal, acoustic,

of the safety properties of dynamical systems. This method has been
successfully applied to many low-dimensional dynamical system models such as
coarse models of aircraft and quadrotors in order to provide safety guarantees
in potentially dangerous scenarios. These guarantees can be provided by the
computation of a backward reachable set (BRS), which represents the set of
states from which the system may be driven into violating safety properties
despite the system's best effort to remain safe. Unfortunately, HJ reachability
is not practical for high-dimensional systems because the complexity of the BRS
computation scales exponentially with the number of state dimensions. Although
numerous approximation techniques are able to tractably provide conservative
estimates of the BRS, they often require restrictive assumptions about system
dynamics without providing an exact solution. In this paper we propose a
general method for decomposing dynamical systems. Even when the resulting
subsystems are coupled, relatively high-dimensional BRSs that were previously
intractable or expensive to compute can now be quickly and exactly computed in
lower-dimensional subspaces. As a result, the curse of dimensionality is
alleviated to a large degree without sacrificing optimality. We demonstrate our
theoretical results through two numerical examples: a 3D Dubins Car model and a
6D Acrobatic Quadrotor model.

harvesting (EH) source which harvests radio frequency (RF) energy from an

a destination node via the relay node. We assume two scenarios for the battery
of the EH source. In the first scenario, we assume that the EH source is not
equipped with a battery and thereby cannot store energy. As a result, the RF
energy harvested during one symbol interval can only be used in the following
symbol interval. In the second scenario, we assume that the EH source is
equipped with a battery having unlimited storage capacity in which it can store
the harvested RF energy. As a result, the RF energy harvested during one symbol
interval can be used in any of the following symbol intervals. For both system

compare the derived capacities to the achievable rates of several benchmark

persistent surveillance missions operating in a communication-constrained,
dynamic environment. The proposed approach decouples high-level task assignment
from low-level motion planning in a modular framework. Coverage assignments and
surveillance parameters are managed by a central base station, and transmitted
to mobile agents via unplanned and asynchronous exchanges. Coverage updates
promote load balancing, while maintaining geometric and temporal
characteristics that allow effective pairing with generic path planners.
Namely, the proposed scheme guarantees that (i) coverage regions are connected
and collectively cover the environment, (ii) subregions may only go uncovered
for bounded periods of time, (iii) collisions (or sensing overlaps) are
inherently avoided, and (iv) under static event likelihoods, the collective
coverage regions converge to a Pareto-optimal configuration. This management
scheme is then paired with a generic path planner satisfying loose assumptions.
The scheme is illustrated through simulated surveillance missions.

simplified linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controllers for large-scale network
systems. When such systems have tens of thousands of states, the design of
conventional LQR controllers becomes numerically challenging, and their
implementation requires a large number of communication links. Our proposed
algorithms bypass these difficulties by clustering the system states using
structural properties of its closed-loop transfer matrix. The assignment of
clusters is defined through a structured projection matrix P, which leads to a
significantly lower-dimensional LQR design. The reduced-order controller is
finally projected back to the original coordinates via an inverse projection.
The problem is, therefore, posed as a model matching problem of finding the
optimal set of clusters or P that minimizes the H2-norm of the error between
the transfer matrix of the full-order network with the full-order LQR and that
with the projected LQR. We derive a tractable relaxation for this model
matching problem, and design a P that solves the relaxation. The design is
shown to be implementable by a convenient, hierarchical two-layer control
architecture, requiring far less number of communication links than full-order
LQR.

polynomial complementarity problem, PCP(f,q), is the nonlinear complementarity
problem of finding a nonnegative vector x such that y=f(x)+q is nonnegative and
orthogonal to x. It is called a tensor complementarity problem if the
polynomial map is homogeneous. In this paper, we establish results connecting
the polynomial complementarity problem PCP(f,q) and the tensor complementarity
problem PCP(f*,0), where f* is the leading term in the decomposition of f as a
sum of homogeneous polynomial maps. We show, for example, that PCP(f,q) has a
nonempty compact solution set for every q when zero is the only solution of
PCP(f*,0)and the local (topological) degree of min{x,f*(x)} at the origin is
nonzero. As a consequence, we establish Karamardian type results for polynomial
complementarity problems. By identifying a tensor A of order m and dimension n
with its corresponding homogeneous polynomial F(x):= Ax^{m-1}, we relate our
results to tensor complementarity problems. These results show that under
appropriate conditions, PCP(F+P,q) has a nonempty compact solution set for all
polynomial maps P of degree less than m-1 and for all vectors q, thereby
substantially improving the existing tensor complementarity results where only
problems of the type PCP(F,q) are considered. We introduce the concept of
degree of an R_0-tensor and show that the degree of an R-tensor is one. We
illustrate our results by constructing matrix based tensors.

visualization and exploration of high-dimensional data spaces. They are
especially useful for the representation of correlations among the dimensions,
which identify relationships and interdependencies between variables. However,
within these high-dimensional spaces, PCPs face difficulties in displaying the
correlation between combinations of dimensions and generally require additional
display space as the number of dimensions increases. In this paper, we present
a new technique for high-dimensional data visualization in which a set of
low-dimensional PCPs are interactively constructed by sampling user-selected
subsets of the high-dimensional data space. In our technique, we first
construct a graph visualization of sets of well-correlated dimensions. Users
observe this graph and are able to interactively select the dimensions by
sampling from its cliques, thereby dynamically specifying the most relevant
lower dimensional data to be used for the construction of focused PCPs. Our
interactive sampling overcomes the shortcomings of the PCPs by enabling the
visualization of the most meaningful dimensions (i.e., the most relevant
information) from high-dimensional spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our technique through two case studies, where we show that the proposed
interactive low-dimensional space constructions were pivotal for visualizing
the high-dimensional data and discovering new patterns.

Eu$_{2}$(C$_{8}$H$_{8}$)$_{3}$ molecule weakly coupled to non-magnetic
electrodes without linker groups. The molecule switches its magnetization
direction from in-plane to out-of-plane when it is charged. In other words, the
magnetic anisotropy of the molecule changes from easy plane to easy axis when
the molecule is charged. By solving the master equation based on model
Hamiltonian, we find that current through the molecule is highly suppressed at
low bias independently of gate voltage due to the interplay between spin
selection rules and the change in the type of magnetic anisotropy. Transitions
between the lowest magnetic levels in successive charge states are forbidden
because the magnetic levels differ by $|\Delta M| > 1/2$ due to the change in
the type of magnetic anisotropy, although the total spins differ by $|\Delta
S|=1/2$. This current suppression can be lifted by significant B field, and the
threshold B field varies as a function of the field direction and the strength
of magnetic anisotropy. The spin blockade effect shed light on switching the
magnetization direction by non-spin-polarized current and on exploring effects
of this property coupled to other molecular degrees of freedom.

determine the background signal level and then the corrected DLSPPW resonator
spectral response, which is found consistent with that obtained from full wave

describe how the marks encode the data. We then rank the perceptual
effectiveness of the deconstructed mappings. To apply the resulting style
template to a new data source we first obtain importance ranks for each new

focuses on generating templates for basic chart types (e.g. variants of bar

effectively exploit and then reason over the relation among queries, documents,

constraint on the reasoning depth. With the use of reinforcement learning,
ReasoNets can dynamically determine whether to continue the comprehension
process after digesting intermediate results, or to terminate reading when it
concludes that existing information is adequate to produce an answer. ReasoNets
have achieved exceptional performance in machine comprehension datasets,
including unstructured CNN and Daily Mail datasets, the Stanford SQuAD dataset,

This indicates that the central region of the turnover galaxies has experienced

method, where the time evolution solutions from the Vlasov-BGK equations of
electron and ion and the Maxwell equations are used to construct a
scale-dependent plasma simulation model. As a result, with the changing of
modeling scales of mesh size and time step and with a variation of Knudsen
number and Larmor radius, the discretized governing equations for a wide range
of plasma evolution regimes can be obtained. The physics recovered in UGKS
ranges from the Vlasov equation in the kinetic scale to different-type
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations in the hydrodynamic scale. The key
dynamics in UGKS is the un-splitting treatment of particle collision,
acceleration, and transport in the construction of numerical flux across a cell
interface. At the same time, the plasma evolution is coupled with the Maxwell
equations in an implicit way, which automatically provides a smooth transition
between the Ampere's law and the Ohm's law for the calculation of electric
field. The time step of UGKS is not limited by the relaxation time, the
cyclotron period, and the speed of light in the MHD regime. The UGKS is
validated by numerical test cases, such as the Landau damping and two stream
instability in the kinetic regime, and the Brio-Wu shock tube problem and the
Orszag- Tang MHD turbulence problem in the hydrodynamic regime. The scheme is
also used to study the geospace environment modeling (GEM), such as the
challenging magnetic reconnection problem in the transition regime. Overall,
the UGKS is a physically reliable multi-scale plasma simulation method. It
provides a powerful and unified approach for the study of plasma physics.

so-called Mott resonances: hybridization of pairs of states close in energy,
but separated spatially. We study the effect of interaction on Mott resonances
in the model of spinful fermions (electrons) with local attraction. This model
is known to exhibit a so-called pseudogap: a suppression of the low-energy
single-particle excitations. Correspondingly, the low-energy dynamical response
is also reduced. However this reduction has mostly quantitative character. In
particular, the Mott formula for frequency-dependent conductivity preserves its
functional asymptotic behavior at low frequencies, but with a small numerical

hypervelocity stars as consequence of the close interaction between the Milky
Way central massive black hole and a passing-by young stellar cluster. We found
that both single and binary HVSs may be generated in a burst-like event, as the
cluster passes near the orbital pericentre. High velocity stars will move close
to the initial cluster orbital plane and in the direction of the cluster
orbital motion at the pericentre. The binary fraction of these HVS jets depends
on the primordial binary fraction in the young cluster. The level of initial
mass segregation determines the value of the average mass of the ejected stars.
Some binary stars will merge, continuing their travel across and out of the
Galaxy as blue stragglers.

successful under the physical model if the signal to interference plus noise
ratio (SINR) at the receiver is above a threshold. The parameterized protocol
model forms a family of decision rules for predicting the success or failure of

has been studied only using an approximation where marginally stability is not
present, which is wrong in the spin glass phase. Because of some technical
difficulties, attempts at deriving a marginally stable solution have been
confined to some perturbative regimes, high connectivity lattices or

extend a recently developed test charge theory to the case of a stiff polymer

for one-loop level electrostatic correlation effects such as the ionic cloud
deformation around the strongly charged DNA molecule as well as image-charge
forces induced by the low DNA permittivity. Our model can reproduce and explain
various characteristics of the experimental phase diagrams for polymer
solutions. First, the addition of polyvalent cations to the electrolyte
solution results in the attraction of the negatively charged polymer by the DNA
molecule. The glue of the like-charge attraction is the enhanced shielding of
the polymer charges by the dense counterion layer at the DNA surface. Secondly,
through the shielding of the DNA-induced electrostatic potential, mono- and
polyvalent cations of large concentration both suppress the like-charge
attraction. Within the same formalism, we also predict a new opposite-charge
repulsion effect between the DNA molecule and a positively charged polymer. In
the presence of polyvalent anions such as sulfate or phosphate, their repulsion
by the DNA charges leads to the charge screening deficiency of the region
around the DNA molecule. This translates into a repulsive force that results in
the decomplexation of the polymer from DNA. This opposite-charge repulsion
phenomenon can be verified by current experiments and the underlying mechanism
can be beneficial to gene therapeutic applications where the control over
polymer-DNA interactions is the key factor.

\textit{generalized residual vector quantization} (GRVQ) to further improve
over RVQ. Many vector quantization methods can be viewed as the special cases
of our proposed framework. We evaluate GRVQ on several large scale benchmark
datasets for large scale search, classification and object retrieval. We
compared GRVQ with existing methods in detail. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our GRVQ framework substantially outperforms existing methods in

organism is the set of detectable, accessible, and controllable states in its

information ratchets---a form of autonomous Maxwellian Demon capable of
exploiting fluctuations in an external information reservoir to harvest useful
work from a thermal bath. This establishes a quantitative paradigm for
understanding how adaptive agents leverage structured thermal environments for
their own thermodynamic benefit. General ratchets behave as memoryful
communication channels, interacting with their environment sequentially and
storing results to an output. The bulk of thermal ratchets analyzed to date,
however, assume memoryless environments that generate input signals without
temporal correlations. Employing computational mechanics and a new
information-processing Second Law of Thermodynamics (IPSL) we remove these
restrictions, analyzing general finite-state ratchets interacting with
structured environments that generate correlated input signals. On the one
hand, we demonstrate that a ratchet need not have memory to exploit an
uncorrelated environment. On the other, and more appropriate to biological
adaptation, we show that a ratchet must have memory to most effectively
leverage structure and correlation in its environment. The lesson is that to
optimally harvest work a ratchet's memory must reflect the input generator's
memory. Finally, we investigate achieving the IPSL bounds on the amount of work
a ratchet can extract from its environment, discovering that finite-state,
optimal ratchets are unable to reach these bounds. In contrast, we show that
infinite-state ratchets can go well beyond these bounds by utilizing their own
infinite ""negentropy"". We conclude with an outline of the collective
thermodynamics of information-ratchet swarms.

application areas including healthcare operations, communications engineering,
and perishable inventory control. We consider a system in which a single server
completes a finite sequence of jobs in discrete time while a controller
dynamically adjusts the service rate. During service, the value of the job
decays so that a greater reward is received for having shorter service times.
We incorporate a non-decreasing cost for holding jobs and a non-decreasing cost
on the service rate. The controller aims to minimize the total cost of
servicing the set of jobs. We show that the optimal policy is non-decreasing in
the number of jobs remaining -- when there are more jobs in the system the
controller should use a higher service rate. The optimal policy does not
necessarily vary monotonically with the residual job value, but we give
algebraic conditions which can be used to determine when it does. These
conditions are then simplified in the case that the reward for completion is
constant when the job has positive value and zero otherwise. These algebraic
conditions are interesting because they can be verified without using
algorithms like value iteration and policy iteration to explicitly compute the
optimal policy. We also discuss some future modeling extensions.

when decreasing the free parameter, but shifted to reduce the probability for
the particle to be a black hole accordingly. The probability grows with
increasing mass slowly for more negative $\beta$, and drops to 0 for a minimum

larger $M$ and $R_{H}$ terms. This is likely due to a ""dimensional reduction""
