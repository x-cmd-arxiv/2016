to SiO$_2$, CO$_2$ and CS$_2$, is a material whose phases known experimentally
up to 6 GPa exhibit 1D chain-like, 2D layered and 3D tetrahedral structures. We
present highly predictive $ab$ $initio$ calculations combined with evolutionary
structure search and molecular dynamics simulations of the structural and
electronic evolution of SiS$_2$ up to 100 GPa. A highly stable CdI$_2$-type
layered structure, which is octahedrally coordinated with space group
$P\bar{3}m1$ surprisingly appears between 4 and up to at least 100 GPa. The
tetrahedral-octahedral switch is naturally expected upon compression, unlike
the layered character realized here by edge-sharing SiS$_6$ octahedral units
connecting within but not among sheets. The predicted phase is semiconducting
with an indirect band gap of about 2 eV at 10 GPa, decreasing under pressure
until metallization around 40 GPa. The robustness of the layered phase suggests
possible recovery at ambient pressure, where calculated phonon spectra indicate
dynamical stability. Even a single monolayer is found to be dynamically stable
in isolation, suggesting that it could possibly be sheared or exfoliated from
bulk $P\bar{3}m1$-SiS$_2$.

  An itemset mining method","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1605.02948",,"10.1016/j.cmpb.2017.05.011",,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: Automatic text summarization tools can help users in the
biomedical domain to access information efficiently from a large volume of
scientific literature and other sources of text documents. In this paper, we
propose a summarization method that combines itemset mining and domain
knowledge to construct a concept-based model and to extract the main subtopics
from an input document. Our summarizer quantifies the informativeness of each
sentence using the support values of itemsets appearing in the sentence.
Methods: To address the concept-level analysis of text, our method initially
maps the original document to biomedical concepts using the UMLS. Then, it
discovers the essential subtopics of the text using a data mining technique,
namely itemset mining, and constructs the summarization model. The employed
itemset mining algorithm extracts a set of frequent itemsets containing
correlated and recurrent concepts of the input document. The summarizer selects
the most related and informative sentences and generates the final summary.
Results: We evaluate the performance of our itemset-based summarizer using the
Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) metrics, performing a
set of experiments. The results show that the itemset-based summarizer performs
better than the compared methods. The itemset-based summarizer achieves the
best scores for all the assessed ROUGE metrics . Conclusion: Compared to the
statistical, similarity, and word frequency methods, the proposed method
demonstrates that the summarization model obtained from the concept extraction
and itemset mining provides the summarizer with an effective metric for
measuring the informative content of sentences. This can lead to an improvement
in the performance of biomedical literature summarization.

of such hyperparameters may be difficult and, typically, based on a
trial-and-error approach. In this work, we adopt a graph-based framework to
interpret and characterize the internal RNN dynamics. Through this insight, we
are able to design a principled unsupervised method to derive configurations
with maximized performances, in terms of prediction error and memory capacity.
In particular, we propose to model time series of neurons activations with the
recently introduced horizontal visibility graphs, whose topological properties
reflect important dynamical features of the underlying dynamic system.
Successively, each graph becomes a layer of a larger structure, called
multiplex. We show that topological properties of such a multiplex reflect
important features of RNN dynamics and are used to guide the tuning procedure.
To validate the proposed method, we consider a class of RNNs called echo state
networks. We perform experiments and discuss results on several benchmarks and

  Fluids; comments welcome",,,,"physics.flu-dyn astro-ph.SR physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In an electrically conducting fluid, vortices stretch out a weak, large-scale
magnetic field to form strong current sheets on their edges. Associated with
these current sheets are magnetic stresses, which are subsequently released
through reconnection, leading to vortex disruption, and possibly even
destruction. This disruption phenomenon is investigated here in the context of
two-dimensional, homogeneous, incompressible magnetohydrodynamics. We derive a
simple order of magnitude estimate for the magnetic stresses --- and thus the
degree of disruption --- that depends on the strength of the background
magnetic field (measured by the parameter $M$, a ratio between the Alfv\'en
speed and a typical flow speed) and on the magnetic diffusivity (measured by
the magnetic Reynolds number $\mbox{Rm}$). The resulting estimate suggests that
significant disruption occurs when $M^{2}\mbox{Rm} = O(1)$. To test our
prediction, we analyse direct numerical simulations of vortices generated by
the breakup of unstable shear flows with an initially weak background magnetic
field. Using the Okubo--Weiss vortex coherence criterion, we introduce a vortex
disruption measure, and show that it is consistent with our predicted scaling,
for vortices generated by instabilities of both a shear layer and a jet.

fundamental yet challenging computational problem. An intrinsic challenge is
the uncertainty caused by the widespread repetitive elements. Here we get
around the uncertainty using the notion of uniquely mapped (UM) reads, which
motivated the design of a new assembler BAUM. It mainly consists of two types
of iterations. The first type of iterations constructs initial contigs from a
reference, say a genome of a species that could be quite distant, by adaptive
read mapping, filtration by the reference's unique regions, and reference
updating. A statistical test is proposed to split the layouts at possible
structural variation sites. The second type of iterations includes mapping,
scaffolding/contig-extension, and contig merging. We extend each contig by
locally assembling the reads whose mates are uniquely mapped to an end of the
contig. Instead of the de Bruijn graph method, we take the
overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) paradigm. The OLC is implemented by parallel
computation, and has linear complexity with respect to the number of contigs.
The adjacent extended contigs are merged if their alignment is confirmed by the
adjusted gap distance. Throughout the assembling, the mapping criterion is
selected by probabilistic calculations. These innovations can be used
complementary to the existing de novo assemblers. Applying this novel method to
the assembly of wild rice Oryza longistaminata genome, we achieved much
improved contig N50, 18.8k, compared with other assemblers. The assembly was
further validated by contigs constructed from an independent library of long
454 reads.

simulations is the accuracy and transferability of the input force field. Force
fields are challenged by heterogeneous environments, where electronic responses
give rise to biologically important forces such as many-body polarisation and
dispersion. The importance of polarisation was recognised early-on and
described by Cochran in 1959 [Philosophical Magazine 4 (1959) 1082-1086].
However, dispersion forces are still treated at the two-body level and in the
dipole limit, although the importance of three-body terms in the condensed
phase was demonstrated by Barker in the 1980s [Phys. Rev. Lett. 57 (1986)
230-233]. A way of treating both polarisation and dispersion on an equal basis
is to coarse grain the electrons a molecular moiety to a single quantum
harmonic oscillator, as suggested as early as the 1960s by Hirschfelder,
Curtiss and Bird [The Molecular Theory of Gases and Liquids (1954)]. This
treatment, when solved in the strong coupling limit, gives all orders of
long-range forces. In the last decade, the tools necessary to exploit this
strong coupling limit have been developed, culminating in a transferable model
of water with excellent predictive power across the phase diagram. This
transferability arises since the environment identifies the form of long range
interactions, rather than the expressions selected by the modeller. Here, we
discuss the role of electronic coarse-graining in predictive multiscale
materials modelling and describe the first implementation of the method in a
general purpose molecular dynamics software, QDO_MD.

The temperate Earth-mass planet Proxima b is the closest exoplanet

characterizing its atmosphere by spatially resolving the planet and obtaining
high-resolution reflected-light spectra. Methods. We propose to develop a
coupling interface between the SPHERE high-contrast imager and the new ESPRESSO
spectrograph, both installed at ESO VLT. The angular separation of 37 mas
between Proxima b and its host star requires the use of visible wavelengths to
spatially resolve the planet on a 8.2-m telescope. At an estimated
planet-to-star contrast of ~10^-7 in reflected light, Proxima b is extremely
challenging to detect with SPHERE alone. However, the combination of a
~10^3-10^4 contrast enhancement from SPHERE to the high spectral resolution of
ESPRESSO can reveal the planetary spectral features and disentangle them from
the stellar ones. Results. We find that significant but realistic upgrades to
SPHERE and ESPRESSO would enable a 5-sigma detection of the planet and yield a
measurement of its true mass and albedo in 20-40 nights of telescope time,
assuming an Earth-like atmospheric composition. Moreover, it will be possible
to probe the O2 bands at 627, 686 and 760 nm, the water vapour band at 717 nm,
and the methane band at 715 nm. In particular, a 3.6-sigma detection of O2
could be made in about 60 nights of telescope time. Those would need to be
spread over 3 years considering optimal observability conditions for the
planet. Conclusions. The very existence of Proxima b and the SPHERE-ESPRESSO
synergy represent a unique opportunity to detect biosignatures on an exoplanet
in the near future. It is also a crucial pathfinder experiment for the
development of Extremely Large Telescopes and their instruments (abridged).

Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) in the task of noisy object recognition. To
address this challenge, a dedicated custom-designed system based on the SP,
histogram calculation module and SVM classifier was implemented. In addition to
implementing their own version of HTM, the authors also designed a profiler
which is capable of tracing all of the key parameters of the system. This was
necessary, since an analysis and monitoring of the system performance turned
out to be extremely difficult using conventional testing and debugging tools.
The system was initially trained on artificially prepared videos without noise
and then tested with a set of noisy video streams. This approach was intended
to mimic a real life scenario where an agent or a system trained to deal with
ideal objects faces a task of classifying distorted and noisy ones in its
regular working conditions. The authors conducted a series of experiments for
various macro parameters of HTM SP, as well as for different levels of video
reduction ratios. The experiments allowed them to evaluate the performance of
two different system setups (i.e. 'Multiple HTMs' and 'Single HTM') under
various noise conditions with 32--frame video files. Results of all the tests
were compared to SVM baseline setup. It was determined that the system
featuring SP is capable of achieving approximately 12 times the noise reduction
for a video signal with with distorted bits accounting for 13\% of the total.
Furthermore, the system featuring SP performed better also in the experiments
without a noise component and achieved a max F1 score of 0.96. The experiments
also revealed that a rise of column and synapse number of SP has a substantial
impact on the performance of the system. Consequently, the highest F1 score
values were obtained for 256 and 4096 synapses and columns respectively.

space environmental effects become relevant. Strong restrictions on how much
close it can get derive from the maximum temperature that the used materials
can stand, in order not to compromise the spacecraft's activity and
functionalities. In other words, the minimum perihelion distance of a given
mission can be determined based on the materials' temperature restrictions. The
temperature of an object in space depends on its optical properties:
reflectivity, absorptivity, transmissivity, and emissivity. Usually, it is
considered as an approximation that the optical properties of materials are
constant. However, emissivity depends on temperature. The consideration of the
temperature dependence of emissivity and conductivity of materials used in the
aerospace industry leads to the conclusion that the temperature dependence on
the heliocentric distance is different from the case of constant optical
properties [1]. Particularly, taking into account that emissivity is directly
proportional to the temperature, the temperature of an object increases as
$r{}^{-2/5}$ when the heliocentric distance $r$ decreases. This means that the
same temperature will actually be reached at a different distance and,
eventually, the spacecraft will be allowed to approach closer to the Sun
without compromising its activities. We focused on metals used for aerospace
structures (Al, Ti), however our analysis can be extended to all kinds of
composite materials, once their optical properties - in particular emissivity -
are defined.

quasistatic regime using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) in a split-bottom
ring shear cell with focus on the macroscopic friction. The aim of our study is
to understand the local rheology of bulk flow at various positions in the shear
band, where the system is in critical state. The general(ized) rheology has
four dimensionless control parameters that relate the time scales of five
significant phenomena, namely, the time scales related to confining pressure
$t_p$, shear rate $t_{\dot{\gamma}}$, particle stiffness $t_k$, gravity $t_g$
and cohesion $t_c$, respectively. We show that those phenomena collectively
contribute to the rheology as multiplicative correction functions.
  While $t_{\dot{\gamma}}$ is large and thus little important for most of the
data studied, it can increase the friction of flow in critical state, where the
shear gradients are high. $t_g$ and $t_k$ are comparable to $t_p$ in the bulk,
but become more or less dominant relative to $t_p$ at the extremes of the free
surface and deep inside the bulk, respectively.
  We also measure the effect of strong wet cohesion on the flow rheology, as
quantified by decreasing $t_c$. Furthermore, the proposed rheological model
predicts well the shear thinning behavior both in the bulk and near the free
surface; shear thinning develops to shear thickening near the free surface with
increasing cohesion.

topology optimization typically involve many load cases, possibly hundreds or
more. The optimal design minimizes a, possibly weighted, average of the
compliance under each load case (or some other objective). This means that in
each optimization step a large finite element problem must be solved for each
load case, leading to an enormous computational effort. On the contrary, the
proposed randomized optimization method with stochastic sampling requires the
solution of only a few (e.g., 5 or 6) finite element problems (large linear
systems) per optimization step. Based on simulated annealing, we introduce a
damping scheme for the randomized approach. Through numerical examples in two

understand the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), whose scientifc
interest by the scientific community escalated exponentially after its
discovery in the 2000's through the collision of ultrarelativistic heavy ions.
  One can enrich the dynamics of the QGP by adding an external field, such as
the baryon chemical potential (needed to study the QCD phase diagram), or a
magnetic field. In this dissertation, we choose to investigate the magnetic
effects. Indeed, there are compelling evidences that strong magnetic fields of
the order $eB\sim 10 m_\pi^2$ are created in the early stages of
ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions.
  The chosen observable to scan possible effects of the magnetic field on the
QGP was the viscosity, due to the famous result $\eta/s=1/4\pi$ obtained via
holography. In a first approach we use a caricature of the QGP, the
$\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills plasma to calculate the deviations of the
viscosity as we add a magnetic field. We must emphasize, though, that a
magnetized plasma has a priori seven viscosity coefficients (five shears and
two bulks). In addition, we also study in this same model the anisotropic heavy
quark-antiquark potential in the presence of a magnetic field.
  In the end, we propose a phenomenological holographic QCD-like model, which
is built upon the lattice QCD data, to study the thermodynamics and the
viscosity of the QGP with an external strong magnetic field.

$\mathbb{R}^n$ of Hausdorff dimension $\frac{m}{v-1}$ that avoids the zeros of
$f_q$ for every $q$. We also find a set that simultaneously avoids the zero
sets of a family of uncountably many functions sharing the same linearization.
In contrast with previous work, our construction allows for non-polynomial
functions as well as uncountably many patterns. In addition, it highlights the
dimensional dependence of the avoiding set on $v$, the number of input
variables.

optimization problem. Using network coding, one wants to provide reliability,
scalability, security, reduced storage overhead, reduced bandwidth for repair
and minimal disk I/O etc. in such systems. Regenerating codes have been used to
optimize some of these parameters, where a file can be reconstructed by
contacting any k nodes in the system and in case of node failure it can be
repaired by using any d nodes in the system. This was further generalized to
Fractional repetition (FR) codes (a smart replication of encoded packets) on n
nodes which also provides optimized disk I/O and where a node failure can be
repaired by contacting some specific set of nodes in the system. Several
constructions of FR codes using graphs and combinatorial designs are known. In
particular, some constructions of codes for heterogeneous DSSs are given using
partial regular graph (where number of packets on each node is different) and
ring construction. In this work, we show that the codes constructed using the
partial regular graph are universally good code. Further, we found several
universally good codes using ring construction and t-construction.

physical layer assisted message authentication scheme that uses Angle of

settings, fundamental limits of AoA estimation are developed in terms of its
Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) and existence of efficient estimator. The problem of
deciding whether the received signal is originated from the claimed GPS
location is formulated as a two sided hypotheses testing problem whose solution
is given by Wald test statics. Moreover, we use correct decision, $P_D$, and
false alarm, $P_F$, probabilities as a quantitative performance measure. The
observation posterior likelihood function is shown to satisfy regularity
conditions necessary for asymptotic normality of the ML-AoA estimator. Thus, we
give $P_D$ and $P_F$ in a closed form.

can react to form larger, more complex molecules. The resulting complex organic

Measurments of the angular dependence give a signature of the quadrupolar

the magnetic field, keeping the magnitude of the magnetic field and the
temperature. Therefore, our method is advantageous for investigating the

the shape of the normalized light curve is not correlated with the peak flux,
the flux histogram of solar flares also follows a power-law distribution with
the same spectral index as the power-law frequency distribution of the peak
flux, which may partially explain why power-law distributions are ubiquitous in
the Universe. We then show that the spectral indexes of the histograms of soft
X-ray fluxes observed by GOES satellites in two different energy channels are
different: the higher energy channel has a harder distribution than the lower
energy channel, which challenges the universal power-law distribution predicted
by SOC models and implies a very soft distribution of thermal energy content of
plasmas probed by the GOES. The temperature ($T$) distribution, on the other
hand, approaches a power-law distribution with an index of 2 for high values of
$T$. Application of SOC models to statistical properties of solar flares needs
to be revisited.

which views the discriminator as an energy function that attributes low
energies to the regions near the data manifold and higher energies to other
regions. Similar to the probabilistic GANs, a generator is seen as being
trained to produce contrastive samples with minimal energies, while the
discriminator is trained to assign high energies to these generated samples.
Viewing the discriminator as an energy function allows to use a wide variety of
architectures and loss functionals in addition to the usual binary classifier
with logistic output. Among them, we show one instantiation of EBGAN framework
as using an auto-encoder architecture, with the energy being the reconstruction
error, in place of the discriminator. We show that this form of EBGAN exhibits
more stable behavior than regular GANs during training. We also show that a
single-scale architecture can be trained to generate high-resolution images.

the Dirichlet boundary-value problem in which the Laplacian is replaced by the
fractional Laplacian and boundary conditions are replaced by conditions on the
exterior of the domain. Specifically, we consider the analogue of the so-called
`walk-on-spheres` algorithm. In the diffusive setting, this entails sampling
the path of Brownian motion as it uniformly exits a sequence of spheres
maximally inscribed in the domain. As this algorithm would otherwise never end,
it is truncated when the `walk-on-spheres` comes within epsilon > 0 of the
boundary. In the setting of the fractional Laplacian, the role of Brownian
motion is replaced by an isotropic alpha-stable process with alpha in (0, 2). A
significant difference to the Brownian setting is that the stable processes
will exit spheres by a jump rather than hitting their boundary. This difference
ensures that disconnected domains may be considered and that, unlike the
diffusive setting, the algorithm ends after an almost surely finite number of
steps.

fluid inside the brain that can be caused by trauma, stroke, infection, or
tumors. It increases the pressure inside the skull and reduces blood and oxygen
supply. To relieve the intracranial pressure, neurosurgeons remove part of the
skull and allow the swollen brain to bulge outward, a procedure known as
decompressive craniectomy. Decompressive craniectomy has been preformed for
more than a century; yet, its effects on the swollen brain remain poorly
understood. Here we characterize the deformation, strain, and stretch in
bulging brains using the nonlinear field theories of mechanics. Our study shows
that even small swelling volumes of 28 to 56 ml induce maximum principal
strains in excess of 30%. For radially outward-pointing axons, we observe
maximal normal stretches of 1.3 deep inside the bulge and maximal tangential
stretches of 1.3 around the craniectomy edge. While the stretch magnitude
varies with opening site and swelling region, our study suggests that the
locations of maximum stretch are universally shared amongst all bulging brains.
Our model can inform neurosurgeons and rationalize the shape and position of
the skull opening, with the overall goal to reduce brain damage and improve the
structural and functional outcomes of decompressive craniectomy in trauma
patients.

thermal desorption at a specific temperature, as a result of heating by solar
radiation at a particular heliocentric distance. Three different scenarios,
that only differ in the way the sail approaches the Sun, were analyzed and
compared. In every case once the perihelion is reached, the sail coat undergoes
thermal desorption. When the desorption process ends, the sail then escapes the
Solar System having the conventional acceleration due to solar radiation
pressure. Thermal desorption here comes as an additional source of solar sail
acceleration beside traditional propulsion systems for extrasolar space
exploration. The compared scenarios are the following: i. Hohmann transfer plus
thermal desorption. In this scenario the sail would be carried as a payload to
the perihelion with a conventional propulsion system by an Hohmann transfer
from Earth's orbit to an orbit very close to the Sun (almost at 0.1 AU) and
then be deployed there. ii. Elliptical transfer plus Slingshot plus thermal
desorption. In this scenario the transfer occurs from Earth's orbit to
Jupiter's orbit. A Jupiter's fly-by leads to the orbit close to the Sun, where
the sail is deployed. iii. Two stage acceleration of the solar sail through
thermal desorption. The proposed sail has two coats of the materials that
undergo thermal desorption at different temperatures depending on the
heliocentric distance. The first desorption occurs at the Earth orbit and
provides the thrust needed to propel the solar sail toward the Sun. The second
desorption is equivalent to that of the other scenarios.

a few days before periastron passage the dense filaments and clumps flow
towards the secondary as a result of its gravitational attraction, and reach
the zone where we inject the secondary wind. We run our simulations for the

cut function of a network is a basic technique to design an efficient
minimization algorithm. A network representable function can be minimized by
computing a minimum $s$-$t$ cut of a directed network, which is a very easy and
fastly solved problem. Hence it is natural to ask what functions are network
representable. In the case of pseudo Boolean functions (functions on
$\{0,1\}^n$), it is known that any submodular function on $\{0,1\}^3$ is
network representable. \v{Z}ivn\'y--Cohen--Jeavons showed by using the theory
of expressive power that a certain submodular function on $\{0,1\}^4$ is not
network representable.
  In this paper, we introduce a general framework for the network
representability of functions on $D^n$, where $D$ is an arbitrary finite set.
We completely characterize network representable functions on $\{0,1\}^n$ in
our new definition. We can apply the expressive power theory to the network
representability in the proposed definition. We prove that some ternary
bisubmodular function and some binary $k$-submodular function are not network
representable.

hyperfine states are coupled by synthetic spin-orbit coupling. This phenomenon
is a direct consequence of spin-orbit coupling, as can be seen clearly from an
effective spin Hamiltonian. By solving this effective model analytically with
the aid of a Holstein-Primakoff transformation for spin-1 system in the low
excitation limit, we conclude that the spin-nematic squeezing, a novel category
of spin squeezing existing exclusively in large spin systems, is enhanced with
increasing spin-orbit intensity and effective Zeeman field, which correspond to
Rabi frequency and two-photon detuning within the Raman scheme for synthetic
spin-orbit coupling, respectively. These trends of dependence are in clear
contrast to spin-orbit coupling induced spin squeezing in spin-1/2 systems. We
also analyze the effects of harmonic trap and interaction with realistic
experimental parameters numerically, and find that a strong harmonic trap
favors spin-nematic squeezing. We further show spin-nematic squeezing can be
interpreted as two-mode entanglement or two-spin squeezing at low excitation.
Our findings can be observed in ^{87}Rb gases with existing techniques of
synthetic spin-orbit coupling and spin-selectively imaging.

components of a time signal with optimal precision. Recent results have shown
that it is possible to recover signals having sparse line spectra from few

computational cost of such approaches remains the major flaw to their
application to practical systems. This work investigates the recovery of
spectrally sparse signal from low-dimensional partial measurements. It is shown
in the first part of this paper that, under a light assumption on the
sub-sampling matrix, the partial line spectral estimation problems can be
relaxed into a low-dimensional semidefinite program. The proof technique relies
on a novel extension of the Gram parametrization to subspaces of trigonometric
polynomials.
  The second part of this work focuses on the analysis of two particular
sub-sampling patterns: multirate sampling and random selection sampling. It is
shown that those sampling patterns guarantee perfect recovery of the line
spectra, and that the reconstruction can be achieved in a poly-logarithmic time
with respect to the full observation case. Moreover, the sub-Nyquist recovery

specialized, high level and concise syntax allows fast and easy writing,
reading and maintenance of complex processing of large scalar symbolic time

imposed by the small thermal de Broglie wavelength, which is inversely related

by the small exciton binding energy of Wannier-Mott excitons, which places the

graph of $N$ metrics. Our gravitational and matter actions are
indistinguishable from $N$ decoupled statements of General Relativity, if one
varies with respect to metric degrees of freedom. We replace $N-1$ metrics with
scalar fields by conformally relating each metric to its unique graph
predecessor. Varying with respect to the $N-1$ scalar fields gives a
multiscalar-tensor model which naturally features dark matter candidates.
Building atop an argument of Chapline and Laughlin, branching is accomplished
with the emergence of order parameters during gravitational collapse: we
bootstrap a suitably defined $N$ scalar field model with initial data from an
$N-1$ field model. We focus on the nearest-neighbour approximation, determine
conditions for dynamical stability, and compute the equations of motion. The
model features a novel screening property where the scalar fields actively
adjust to decouple themselves from the stress, oscillating about the requisite
values. In the Newtonian limit, these background values for the scalar fields
exactly reproduce Newton's law of gravitation.

  Wireless Systems","6 pages, to be published in Proc. IEEE GLOBECOM 2016, Washington,
  D.C., USA",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Analog beamforming with phased arrays is a promising technique for 5G
wireless communication at millimeter wave frequencies. Using a discrete
codebook consisting of multiple analog beams, each beam focuses on a certain
range of angles of arrival or departure and corresponds to a set of fixed phase
shifts across frequency due to practical hardware considerations. However, for
sufficiently large bandwidth, the gain provided by the phased array is actually
frequency dependent, which is an effect called beam squint, and this effect
occurs even if the radiation pattern of the antenna elements is frequency
independent. This paper examines the nature of beam squint for a uniform linear
array (ULA) and analyzes its impact on codebook design as a function of the
number of antennas and system bandwidth normalized by the carrier frequency.
The criterion for codebook design is to guarantee that each beam's minimum gain
for a range of angles and for all frequencies in the wideband system exceeds a
target threshold, for example 3 dB below the array's maximum gain. Analysis and
numerical examples suggest that a denser codebook is required to compensate for
beam squint. For example, 54% more beams are needed compared to a codebook
design that ignores beam squint for a ULA with 32 antennas operating at a
carrier frequency of 73 GHz and bandwidth of 2.5 GHz. Furthermore, beam squint
with this design criterion limits the bandwidth or the number of antennas of
the array if the other one is fixed.

speeds first increased rapidly from a few km s$^{-1}$ to the peak values of
45$-$52 km s$^{-1}$, before decreasing gradually to the initial levels. The
decay timescales of condensation were 3$-$4 minutes, indicating ongoing
magnetic reconnection. Interestingly, the downflow speeds are positively
correlated with logarithm of the Si {\sc iv} line intensity and time derivative

focus on settings in which the policy maker may want to select amongst a

when approximating a complicated class via a sieve. We adapt and extend results

shows that it is able to perform model selection over the collection of

fringe visibility is measured for different pairs of source locations, the
anti-Hermitian part of the complex-valued non-local correlation tensor can be
determined, which can then be decomposed to give the natural dynamical modes of

relativistic regime is addressed, seeking connection to the (orthodox)
single-particle Newton-Wigner position. The effect of non-positive excursions
of the ensemble density for extreme cases of positive-energy waves is easily
computed using an integral of the equations of motion developed here for free
spin-0 particles in 1+1 dimensions and is interpreted in terms of virtual-like
pair creation and annihilation beneath the Compton wavelength. A Bohmtheoretic
description of the acausal explosion of a specific Newton-Wigner-localized
state is presented in detail. The presence of virtual pairs found is
interpreted as the Bohm picture of the spatial extension beyond single point
particles proposed in the 1960s as to why space-like hyperplane dependence of
the Newton-Wigner wavefunctions may be needed to achieve Lorentz covariance.
For spin-1/2 particles the convective current is speculatively utilized for
achieving parity with the spin-0 theory. The spin-0 improper quantum potential
is generalized to an improper stress tensor for spin-1/2 particles.

equilibrium, with one or more cavities inside it, and with fixed charges placed
outside the conductors and inside the cavities. The field inside a particular
cavity is then only due to charges within that cavity itself and to the surface
charge induced on the surface of the same cavity. A similar statement holds for
the exterior of the conductor. Although this is an elementary property of
conductors, it is not a trivial statement, as explained in this article.
Undergraduate texts in electrodynamics do not discuss at length or provide a
complete argument for an important problem such as this. Two simple and
complete proofs are provided in this note with the help of the standard
electrostatic uniqueness theorems.

study the electrical transport properties of intermetallic compound YbAl3. To
accurately predict the electronic relaxation time, we use the density
functional perturbation theory and Wannier interpolation techniques which can
effectively treat the electron-phonon scattering. Our calculated transport
coefficients of YbAl3 are in reasonable agreement with the experimentally
measured results. Strikingly, we discover that in evaluating the Seebeck
coefficient of YbAl3, the scattering term has a larger contribution than the
band term and should be explicitly considered in the calculations, especially
for the case with localized bands near the Fermi level. Moreover, we
demonstrate that by reducing the sample size to less than ~30 nm, the
electronic thermal conductivity of YbAl3 can be sufficiently suppressed so that
the thermoelectric figure of merit can be further enhanced.

  Hypothesis","40 pages, 1 figure. In this Version, some typos have been removed and
  the Appendix 5 is slightly modified and a new Appendix 6 has been added",,,,"math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates the analytic properties of the Liouville function's
Dirichlet series that obtains from the function F(s)= zeta(2s)/zeta(s), where s
is a complex variable and zeta(s) is the Riemann zeta function. The paper
employs a novel method of summing the series by casting it as an infinite
number of sums over sub-series that exhibit a certain symmetry and rapid
convergence. In this procedure, which heavily invokes the prime factorization
theorem, each sub-series has the property that it oscillates in a predictable
fashion, rendering the analytic properties of the Dirichlet series
determinable. With this method, the paper demonstrates that, for every integer
with an even number of primes in its factorization, there is another integer
that has an odd number of primes (multiplicity counted) in its factorization.
Furthermore, by showing that a sufficient condition derived by Littlewood
(1912) is satisfied, the paper demonstrates that the function F(s) is analytic
over the two half-planes Re(s) > 1/2 and Re(s)<1/2. This establishes that the
nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function can only occur on the critical
line Re(s)=1/2.

quantum mechanics provide either incomplete or semi-classical explanations that
are not connected with the elementary concepts of quantum mechanics. We
illustrate the conduction phenomena using the simplest model system in quantum
dynamics, a particle in a box (PIB). To induce the particle dynamics, a linear
potential tilting the bottom of the box is introduced, which is equivalent to
imposing a constant electric field for a charged particle. Although the PIB
model represents a closed system that cannot have a flow of electrons through
the system, we consider the oscillatory dynamics of the particle probability
density as the analogue of the electric current. Relating the amplitude and
other parameters of the particle oscillatory dynamics with the gap between the
ground and excited states of the PIB model allows us to demonstrate one of the
most basic dependencies of electric conductivity on the valence-conduction band
gap of the material.

of micro and nanostructures using one beam of visible light of a single
wavelength. Objects with diameters as small as 10 nm can be located, and their
position tracked with nanometer precision. Multiple objects distributed either
on planes perpendicular to the incidence direction or along axial lines in the
incidence direction are distinguishable. More precisely, the shape and size of
plane sections perpendicular to the incidence direction can be clearly
determined, even for asymmetric and non-convex scatterers. Axial resolution
improves as the size of the objects decreases. Initial reconstructions may
proceed by glueing together 2D horizontal slices between axial peaks or by
locating objects at 3D peaks of topological energies, depending on the
effective wavenumber. Below a threshold size, topological derivative based
iterative schemes improve initial predictions of the location, size and shape
of objects by postprocessing fixed measured data. For larger sizes, tracking
the peaks of topological energy fields that average information from additional
incident light beams seems to be more effective.
