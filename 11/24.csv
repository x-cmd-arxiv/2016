submarine seems to sink to observers at rest within the ocean, but it rather
seems to float in the submarine proper frame. In this letter, we show that the
paradox arises from a misuse of the Archimedes principle in the relativistic
case. Considering first the special relativity, we show that any relativistic
force field can be written in the Lorentz form, so that it can always be
decomposed into a \emph{static} (electric-like) and a \emph{dynamic}
(magnetic-like) part. These gravitomagnetic effects provide a relativistic
formulation of Archimedes principle, from which the paradox is explained.
Besides, if the curved spacetime on the vicinity of the Earth is taken into
account, we show that the gravitational force exerted by Earth on a moving body
must increase with the speed of the body. The submarine paradox is then
analyzed again with this speed-dependent gravitational force.

impressive advancements in ALD techniques dominate literature searches of
particle ALD coating, such methods may lead to a more time-intensive or
cost-prohibitive process than what is required by many typical academic
researchers. Thus we have performed this study to explore the limits of static
planar ALD particle coating, the simplest method to coat nanoparticles with an
ALD film. Using an Arradiance GEMStar6 ALD system, we have explored a fast and
simple static ALD particle coating process. Our protocol produces relatively
small, but still academically useful, quantities of uniformally ALD-coated
nanospheres. This process can be scaled up to nanoparticle samples in the tens
of milligram to gram range. We have demonstrated that we can achieve silica or
titania spherical particle synthesis, and then uniform ALD coating on the
nanoparticles, all within 8-10 hours. The diameter of the chemically
synthesized silica and titania nanoparticles is tunable from 50 nm up to
greater than a micron. The refractive index of the titania nanoparticles is
tunable from approximately 1.7 to 2.7. This report will be most useful for
researchers who are new to particle ALD, or who want to experiment with core

redistributes its fluid to maintain a universal shape originating from a
surface tension based deceleration of the jet; the shape is universal in the
sense that the shape of the rising jet is the same at all times; only the
scaling depends on fluid parameters and deceleration. An inviscid equation of

analysis of the reconnection rate as a function of the opening angle made by
the upstream magnetic fields, finding a maximum reconnection rate close to 0.2.
The predictions compare favorably to particle-in-cell simulations of
relativistic electron-positron and non-relativistic electron-proton
reconnection. The fact that simulated reconnection rates are close to the
predicted maximum suggests reconnection proceeds near the most efficient state
allowed at the MHD-scale. The rate near the maximum is relatively insensitive
to the opening angle, potentially explaining why reconnection has a similar
fast rate in differing models.

  This paper presents Browsix, a framework that bridges the considerable gap

Browsix comprises two core parts: (1) a JavaScript-only system that makes core

shared file system) available to web applications; and (2) extended JavaScript
runtimes for C, C++, Go, and Node.js that support running programs written in

shell, making it straightforward to connect applications together via pipes.
  We illustrate Browsix's capabilities via case studies that demonstrate how it
eases porting legacy applications to the browser and enables new functionality.
We demonstrate a Browsix-enabled LaTeX editor that operates by executing
unmodified versions of pdfLaTeX and BibTeX. This browser-only LaTeX editor can
render documents in seconds, making it fast enough to be practical. We further
demonstrate how Browsix lets us port a client-server application to run
entirely in the browser for disconnected operation. Creating these applications
required less than 50 lines of glue code and no code modifications,
demonstrating how easily Browsix can be used to build sophisticated web
applications from existing parts without modification.

region where the system exhibits a regular dynamics. This low-energy region is
always present and has been described both in a semiclassical and a full
quantum analysis. Its Peres lattices exhibit that many observables vary
smoothly with energy, along lines which beg for a formal description. It is
shown how the adiabatic invariants provide a rationale to their presence in
many cases. They are built employing the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, valid
when a fast system is coupled to a much slower one. As the Dicke model has a
one bosonic and one fermionic degree of freedom, two versions of the
approximation are used, depending on which one is the faster. In both cases a
noticeably accord with exact numerical results is obtained. The employment of
the adiabatic invariants provides a simple and clear theoretical framework to
study the physical phenomenology associated to this energy regime, far beyond
the energies where the quadratic approximation can be employed.

and are asked to select k sets in order to minimize the size of their union.
Despite being a very natural problem, it has received surprisingly little
attention: the only known approximation algorithm is an
$O(\sqrt{n})$-approximation due to [Chlamt\'a\v{c} et al APPROX '16]. This
problem can also be viewed as the bipartite version of the Small Set Vertex
Expansion problem (SSVE), which we call the Small Set Bipartite Vertex
Expansion problem (SSBVE). SSVE, in which we are asked to find a set of k nodes
to minimize their vertex expansion, has not been as well studied as its
edge-based counterpart Small Set Expansion (SSE), but has recently received
significant attention, e.g. [Louis-Makarychev APPROX '15]. However, due to the
connection to Unique Games and hardness of approximation the focus has mostly
been on sets of size $k = \Omega(n)$, while we focus on the case of general
$k$, for which no polylogarithmic approximation is known.
  We improve the upper bound for this problem by giving an
$n^{1/4+\varepsilon}$ approximation for SSBVE for any constant $\varepsilon >
0$. Our algorithm follows in the footsteps of Densest $k$-Subgraph (DkS) and
related problems, by designing a tight algorithm for random models, and then
extending it to give the same guarantee for arbitrary instances. Moreover, we
show that this is tight under plausible complexity conjectures: it cannot be
approximated better than $O(n^{1/4})$ assuming an extension of the so-called
""Dense vs Random"" conjecture for DkS to hypergraphs. We show that the same
bound is also matched by an integrality gap for a super-constant number of
rounds of the Sherali-Adams LP hierarchy, and an even worse integrality gap for
the natural SDP relaxation. Finally, we design a simple bicriteria $\tilde
O(\sqrt{n})$ approximation for the more general SSVE problem.

antennas to overcome the severe signal attenuation. However, perfect alignment
between transmitting and receiving antenna beams is rare in practice and
overheard signals from concurrent transmissions may cause significant
interference. In this paper we analyze the impact of antenna beam misalignment
on the system performance of 60 GHz wireless access. We quantify the signal
power loss caused by beam misalignment and the interference power accumulated
from neighboring concurrent transmissions whose signals are leaked either via
the main-beam pointing in the similar direction or via side-lobe emission, and
derive the probability distribution of the signal to interference plus noise
power ratio (SINR). For scenarios where interfering transmitters are
distributed uniformly at random, we derive upper and lower bounds on the
cumulative distribution function (abbreviated as CDF or c.d.f.) of SINR, which
can be easily applied to evaluate system performance. We validate our
analytical results by simulations where random nodes are uniformly distributed
within a circular hall, and evaluate the sensitivity of average throughput and
outage probability against two parameters: the half-power (3 dB) beamwidth to
main-lobe beamwidth ratio and the beam misalignment deviation to main-lobe
beamwidth ratio. Our results indicate that the derived lower bound performs
well when the half-power beamwidth to main-lobe beamwidth ratio or the number
of concurrent transmission links is small. When the number of active links is
high, it is desirable in antenna design to balance the degradation caused by
beam misalignment (wider beam is better) and the interference from concurrent
transmission (narrower beam is better).

$10^7\,M_\odot$. We estimate the age of the young stellar clusters in the
circumnuclear ring to be $\lesssim 10\,\mathrm{Myr}$. No age gradient along the
ring is visible. However, the starburst age is comparable to the travel time
along the ring, indicating that the clusters almost completed a full orbit
along the ring during their life time. In the central $\sim 600\,\mathrm{pc}$,
we find a hot molecular gas mass of $\sim 730\,M_\odot$ which, with standard
conversion factors, corresponds to a large cold molecular gas reservoir of
several $10^8\,M_\odot$, in accordance with CO measurements from the
literature. The gaseous and stellar kinematics show several deviations from
pure disc motion, including a circumnuclear disc and signs of a nuclear bar
potential. In addition, we confirm streaming motions on $\sim 200\,\mathrm{pc}$
scale that have recently been detected in CO(1-0) emission. Due to our enhanced
angular resolution of $<1\,\mathrm{arcsec}$, we find further streaming motion
within the inner arcsecond, that have not been detected until now. Despite the
flow of gas towards the centre, no signs for significant AGN activity are
found. This raises the questions what determines whether the infalling gas will
fuel an AGN or star formation.

the development of new MCMC and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms which

2.44 false binaries in our sample. Among these, we find 22 systems with 3

possible red giant. We find the largest long-lived binary separation to be
nearly 3.2 pc; even so, $>76\%$ of GAMBLES long-lived binaries have large

find the distribution of binary separations is clearly bimodal, corroborating

distance exceeding its size within the exposure time, is introduced. FMOs may,
and typically do, rotate with high angular speed. FMOs are very common in
sports videos, but are not rare elsewhere. In a single frame, such objects are
often barely visible and appear as semi-transparent streaks.
  A method for the detection and tracking of FMOs is proposed. The method
consists of three distinct algorithms, which form an efficient localization
pipeline that operates successfully in a broad range of conditions. We show
that it is possible to recover the appearance of the object and its axis of
rotation, despite its blurred appearance. The proposed method is evaluated on a
new annotated dataset. The results show that existing trackers are inadequate
for the problem of FMO localization and a new approach is required. Two
applications of localization, temporal super-resolution and highlighting, are

We identify these crossings with recently observed but unexpected dips (so

be accurately controlled; they co-exist with the usual broader coherence dips

the graph $G-\{u,v\}$ has a perfect matching. Deleting an edge $e$ from a brick
$G$ results in a graph with zero, one or two vertices of degree two. The
bicontraction of a vertex of degree two consists of contracting the two edges
incident with it; and the retract of $G-e$ is the graph $J$ obtained from it by
bicontracting all its vertices of degree two. An edge $e$ is thin if $J$ is
also a brick. Carvalho, Lucchesi and Murty [How to build a brick, Discrete
Mathematics 306 (2006), 2383-2410] showed that every brick, distinct from
$K_4$, the triangular prism $\overline{C_6}$ and the Petersen graph, has a thin
edge. Their theorem yields a generation procedure for bricks, using which they
showed that every simple planar solid brick is an odd wheel.
  A brick $G$ is near-bipartite if it has a pair of edges $\alpha$ and $\beta$
such that $G-\{\alpha,\beta\}$ is bipartite and matching covered; examples are
$K_4$ and $\overline{C_6}$. The significance of near-bipartite graphs arises
from the theory of ear decompositions of matching covered graphs.
  The object of this paper is to establish a generation procedure which is
specific to the class of near-bipartite bricks. In particular, we prove that if
$G$ is any near-bipartite brick, distinct from $K_4$ and $\overline{C_6}$, then
$G$ has a thin edge $e$ so that the retract $J$ of $G-e$ is also
near-bipartite.
  In a subsequent work, with Marcelo H. de Carvalho, we use the results of this
paper to prove a generation theorem for simple near-bipartite bricks.

source separation, image classification and image denoising. This paper
presents a new algorithm for segmentation of an image into background and
foreground text and graphics using sparse decomposition. First, the background
is represented using a suitable smooth model, which is a linear combination of
a few smoothly varying basis functions, and the foreground text and graphics
are modeled as a sparse component overlaid on the smooth background. Then the
background and foreground are separated using a sparse decomposition framework
and imposing some prior information, which promote the smoothness of
background, and the sparsity and connectivity of foreground pixels. This
algorithm has been tested on a dataset of images extracted from HEVC standard
test sequences for screen content coding, and is shown to outperform prior
methods, including least absolute deviation fitting, k-means clustering based
segmentation in DjVu, and shape primitive extraction and coding algorithm.

high-fidelity simulations are too computationally expensive to survey the

engineering physics, computer simulations and statistical modeling. In this
paper, we propose a new surrogate model that provides efficient prediction and
uncertainty quantification of turbulent flows in swirl injectors with varying
geometries, devices commonly used in many engineering applications. The novelty
of the proposed method lies in the incorporation of known physical properties
of the fluid flow as {simplifying assumptions} for the statistical model. In
view of the massive simulation data at hand, which is on the order of hundreds
of gigabytes, these assumptions allow for accurate flow predictions in around
an hour of computation time. To contrast, existing flow emulators which forgo
such simplications may require more computation time for training and
prediction than is needed for conducting the simulation itself. Moreover, by
accounting for coupling mechanisms between flow variables, the proposed model
can jointly reduce prediction uncertainty and extract useful flow physics,
which can then be used to guide further investigations.

homogeneity, if any. We consider the behaviour of the scaled number counts and
the scaling relations of different moments of the galaxy number counts in
spheres of varying radius $R$ to calculate the spectrum of the
Minkowski-Bouligand general dimension $D_{q} (R)$ for $-4 \leq q \leq 4$. The
present analysis provides us the opportunity to study the spectrum of the
generalized dimension $D_{q}(R)$ for multiple tracers of the cosmic density
field over a wide range of length scales and allows us to confidently test the
validity of the assumption of cosmic homogeneity. Our analysis indicates that
the SDSS main galaxy sample is homogeneous on a length scales of $80\, h^{-1}\,
{\rm Mpc} $ and beyond whereas the SDSS quasar sample and the SDSS LRG sample
show transition to homogeneity on an even larger length scales at $\sim 150\,
h^{-1}\, {\rm Mpc}$ and $\sim 230\, h^{-1}\, {\rm Mpc}$ respectively. These
differences in the scale of homogeneity arise due to the effective mass and
redshift scales probed by the different tracers in a Universe where structures
form hierarchically. Our results reaffirm the validity of cosmic homogeneity on
large scales irrespective of the tracers used and strengthens the foundations

based detectors. If the precise frequency $\sigma$ is known, guided
gravitational wave searches with enhanced detectability are possible. Because
of its physical importance many authors have calculated the r-mode frequency.
For the dominant mode, the associated gravitational wave frequency is 4/3 times
the angular velocity of the star $\Omega$, subject to various corrections of
which relativistic and rotational corrections are the most important. This has
led several authors to investigate the dependence of the r-mode frequency on
factors such as the relativistic compactness parameter ($M/R$) and the angular
velocity of stars with different equations of state. The results found so far,
however, are almost independent of the equation of state. Here we investigate
the effect of rapid rotation and differential rotation on $\sigma$. We evolve
the perturbation equations using the Cowling approximation by applying finite
differencing methods to compute the r-mode frequency for a series of rotating
neutron stars with polytropic equations of state. We find that rotational
effects in the r-mode frequency can be larger than relativistic effects for
rapidly spinning stars with low compactness, reducing the observed frequency.
Differential rotation also acts to decrease $\sigma$, but its effect inscreases
with the compactness. The results presented here are relevant to the design of
gravitational wave and electromagnetic r-mode searches.

handedness due to the lack of inversion, mirror, or other roto-inversion
symmetries. These crystals represent a broad, important class of quantum
materials; their structural chirality has been found to allow for a wide range
of phenomena in condensed matter physics, including skyrmions in chiral
magnets, unconventional pairing in chiral superconductors, nonlocal transport
and unique magnetoelectric effects in chiral metals, as well as
enantioselective photoresponse. Nevertheless, while these phenomena have been
intensely investigated, the topological electronic properties of chiral
crystals have still remained largely uncharacterized. While recent theoretical
advances have shown that the presence of crystalline symmetries can protect
novel band crossings in 2D and 3D systems, we present a new class of Weyl
fermions enforced by the absence of particular crystal symmetries. These
""Kramers-Weyl"" fermions are a universal topological electronic property of all
nonmagnetic chiral crystals with spin-orbit coupling (SOC); they are guaranteed
by lattice translation, structural chirality, and time-reversal symmetry, and
unlike conventional Weyl fermions, appear at time-reversal-invariant momenta
(TRIMs). We cement this finding by identifying representative chiral materials
in the majority of the 65 chiral space groups in which Kramers-Weyl fermions
are relevant to low-energy physics. By combining our analysis with the results
of previous works, we determine that all point-like nodal degeneracies in
nonmagnetic chiral crystals with relevant SOC carry nontrivial Chern numbers.
We further show that, beyond the previous phenomena allowed by structural
chirality, Kramers-Weyl fermions enable unusual phenomena, such as a novel
electron spin texture, chiral bulk Fermi surfaces over large energy windows.

hybrid transitions, i.e. the scaling laws of the standard models coexist with

ellipsoidal photosphere, viewed nearly edge-on, and probably augmented by
optical scattering from circumstellar dust. We suggest that interaction with an
equatorial distribution of CSM, perhaps the result of binary evolution, is
responsible for generating the photospheric asphericity. Relatedly, our
late-time optical imaging and spectroscopy shows that asymmetric CSM
interaction is ongoing, and the morphology of broad H-alpha emission from
shock-excited ejecta provides additional evidence that the geometry of the
interaction region is ellipsoidal. Alternatively, a prolate ellipsoidal
geometry from an intrinsically bipolar explosion is also a plausible

compared for higher-order concepts such as view similarity, pose variation and
occlusion. To achieve this, we use a denoising convolutional auto-encoder to
establish an embedding space, and place the decoder after a fast end-to-end
network trained to regress directly to the encoded shape vectors. This yields
what to the best of our knowledge is the first real-time shape prediction
network, running at ~35 FPS on a high-end desktop. With higher-order shape
reasoning well-integrated into the network pipeline, the network shows the
useful practical quality of generalising to unseen categories similar to the
ones in the training set, something that most existing approaches fail to
handle.

marked a milestone in the understanding of several properties of galaxies, such
as star-formation history, morphology, and metallicity. However, in many cases,
these surveys provide fluxes from fixed small apertures (e.g. fibre), which
cover a scant fraction of the galaxy, compelling us to use aperture corrections
to study the global properties of galaxies. In this work, we derive the current
total star formation rate (SFR) of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) star-forming
galaxies, using an empirically based aperture correction of the measured $\rm
H\alpha$ flux for the first time, thus minimising the uncertainties associated
with reduced apertures. All the $\rm H\alpha$ fluxes have been
extinction-corrected using the $\rm H\alpha/H\beta$ ratio free from aperture
effects. The total SFR for $\sim$210,000 SDSS star-forming galaxies has been
derived applying pure empirical $\rm H\alpha$ and $\rm H\alpha/H\beta$ aperture
corrections based on the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey.
We find that, on average, the aperture-corrected SFR is $\sim$0.65dex higher
than the SDSS fibre-based SFR. The relation between the SFR and stellar mass
for SDSS star-forming galaxies (SFR--$\rm M_\star$) has been obtained, together
with its dependence on extinction and $\rm H\alpha$ equivalent width. We
compare our results with those obtained in previous works and examine the
behaviour of the derived SFR in six redshift bins, over the redshift range $\rm
0.005 \leq z\leq 0.22$. The SFR--$\rm M_\star$ sequence derived here is in
agreement with selected observational studies based on integral field
spectroscopy of individual galaxies as well as with the predictions of recent
theoretical models of disc galaxies.

and a partially duplex clique. In the $q$-neighbor Ising model each spin
interacts only with $q$ spins randomly chosen from its whole neighborhood. In
the case of a duplex clique the change of a spin is allowed only if both levels
simultaneously induce this change. Due to the mean-field like nature of the
model we are able to derive the analytic form of transition probabilities and
solve the corresponding master equation. The existence of the second level
changes dramatically the character of the phase transition. In the case of the
monoplex clique, the $q$-neighbor Ising model exhibits continuous phase
transition for $q=3$, discontinuous phase transition for $q \ge 4$ and for
$q=1$ and $q=2$ the phase transition is not observed. On the other hand, in the
case of the duplex clique continuous phase transitions are observed for all
values of $q$, even for $q=1$ and $q=2$. Subsequently we introduce a partially
duplex clique, parametrized by $r \in [0,1]$, which allows us to tune the
network from monoplex ($r=0$) to duplex ($r=1$). Such a generalized topology,
in which a fraction $r$ of all nodes appear on both levels, allows to obtain
the critical value of $r=r^*(q)$ at which a tricriticality (switch from
continuous to discontinuous phase transition) appears.

It has attracted much
interest in the Computer Vision community to efficiently solve problems

models the posterior probability distribution as a product of marginal
probabilities, it may fail to properly account for important dependencies
between variables. We therefore replace the fully factorized distribution of
Mean Field by a weighted mixture of such distributions, that similarly
minimizes the KL-Divergence to the true posterior. By introducing two new
ideas, namely, conditioning on groups of variables instead of single ones and
using a parameter of the conditional random field potentials, that we identify
to the temperature in the sense of statistical physics to select such groups,
we can perform this minimization efficiently. Our extension of the clamping
method proposed in previous works allows us to both produce a more descriptive
approximation of the true posterior and, inspired by the diverse MAP paradigms,
fit a mixture of Mean Field approximations. We demonstrate that this positively
impacts real-world algorithms that initially relied on mean fields.

making positive use of process-induced variations in the devices' nonlinear
I-Vs and their analog tuning. We first characterize security metrics for a
basic building block of the security primitives based on a two layer stack with
monolithically integrated 10x10 250-nm half-pitch memristive crossbar circuits.
The experimental results show that the average uniformity and diffusivity,
measured on a random sample of 6,000 64-bit responses, out of ~697,000 total,
is close to ideal 50% with 5% standard deviation for both metrics. The

with $\gamma$-ray bursts detected during the first observing run of the
Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). We find no
evidence of a GW signal for any of the 41 $\gamma$-ray bursts for which LIGO
data are available with sufficient duration. For all $\gamma$-ray bursts, we
place lower bounds on the distance to the source using the optimistic
assumption that GWs with an energy of $10^{-2}M_\odot c^2$ were emitted within
the $16$-$500\,$Hz band, and we find a median 90% confidence limit of 71$\,$Mpc
at 150$\,$Hz. For the subset of 19 short/hard $\gamma$-ray bursts, we place
lower bounds on distance with a median 90% confidence limit of 90$\,$Mpc for
binary neutron star (BNS) coalescences, and 150 and 139$\,$Mpc for neutron
star-black hole coalescences with spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum
and in a generic configuration, respectively. These are the highest distance
limits ever achieved by GW searches. We also discuss in detail the results of
the search for GWs associated with GRB 150906B, an event that was localized by
the InterPlanetary Network near the local galaxy NGC 3313, which is at a
luminosity distance of 54$\,$Mpc ($z=0.0124$). Assuming the $\gamma$-ray
emission is beamed with a jet half-opening angle $\leq 30^{\circ}$, we exclude
a BNS and a neutron star-black hole in NGC 3313 as the progenitor of this event
with confidence $>99$%. Further, we exclude such progenitors up to a distance
of 102$\,$Mpc and 170$\,$Mpc, respectively.

states of light with a high modulation bandwidth. Our approach consists of
superimposing two laser light fields with the same wavelength, but with

together with earlier known results on modular quotient singularities, implies
first that a theorem of Kemper and Malle on irreducible groups generated by

of the muonic systems, i.e., molecules containing a positively charged muon,
conceiving the muon as a quantum oscillator, which are completely equivalent to
the usual two-component HF equations used to derive stationary states of the
muonic molecules. In these effective equations, a non-Coulombic potential is
added to the orthodox coulomb and exchange potential energy terms, which
describes the interaction of the muon and the electrons effectively and is
optimized during the self-consistent field cycles. While in the two-component
HF equations muon is treated as a quantum wave, in the effective HF equations
it is absorbed into the effective potential and practically transformed into an
effective potential field experienced by electrons. The explicit form of the
effective potential depends on the nature of muon vibrations and is derivable
from the basis set used to expand the muonic spatial orbital. The resulting
effective Hartree-Fock equations are implemented computationally and used
successfully, as a proof of concept, in a series of the muonic molecules

solve the algebraic version of the equations muon-specific gaussian basis sets
are designed for both muon and surrounding electrons and it is demonstrated
that the optimized exponents are quite distinct from those derived for the

principle can be used for any muonic system while it is the starting point for
a general effective electronic structure theory that incorporates various types
of quantum correlations into the muonic systems beyond the HF equations.

($m>10^{-22}$eV) described by a complex scalar field (SFDM) with global U(1)
symmetry, with comoving particle number density conserved after particle
production during standard reheating. We allow for repulsive self-interaction.
In a Lambda-SFDM universe, SFDM starts relativistic, evolving from stiff (w=1)
to radiation-like (w=1/3), becoming nonrelativistic (w=0) at late times. Thus,
a stiff-SFDM-dominated era precedes the familiar radiation-dominated era. SFDM
particle mass $m$ and quartic self-interaction strength \lambda, are therefore
constrained by cosmological observables, N_{eff}, the effective number of
neutrino species during BBN, and z_{eq}, the matter-radiation equality
redshift. Since the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from
inflation is amplified during the stiff-SFDM-dominated era, it can also
contribute a radiationlike component large enough to affect these observables.
Remarkably, this amplification makes this SGWB detectable by current GW
experiments, e.g., aLIGO/Virgo and LISA, for Lambda-SFDM models satisfying
cosmological constraints, for a range of reheat temperatures T_{re} and
currently allowed values of tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. For given r and
$\lambda/(mc^2)^2$, the marginally-allowed Lambda-SFDM model for each T_{re}
has the smallest m that satisfies cosmological constraints. For example, for
marginally-allowed models with r=0.01 and
$\lambda/(mc^2)^2=10^{-18}$eV$^{-1}$cm$^3$, null detection by the aLIGO O1 run
excludes 8.75*10^3<T_{re} (GeV)<1.7*10^5 at 95% confidence, demonstrating that
GW experiments already place a new kind of cosmological constraint on SFDM. A
wider parameter range should be accessible to aLIGO/Virgo O5, with potential to
detect this signature of Lambda-SFDM. For this same illustrative family,
3-sigma detection is predicted for 600<T_{re} (GeV)<10^7.

  Community Structure of Weighted Networks with Continuous Annotation",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A major challenge in neuroimaging is understanding the mapping of
neurophysiological dynamics onto cognitive functions. Traditionally, these maps
have been constructed by examining changes in the activity magnitude of regions
related to task performance. Recently, network neuroscience has produced
methods to map connectivity patterns among many regions to certain cognitive
functions by drawing on tools from network science and graph theory. However,
these two different views are rarely addressed simultaneously, largely because
few tools exist that account for patterns between nodes while simultaneously
considering activation of nodes. We address this gap by solving the problem of
community detection on weighted networks with continuous (non-integer)
annotations by deriving a generative probabilistic model. This model generates
communities whose members connect densely to nodes within their own community,
and whose members share similar annotation values. We demonstrate the utility
of the model in the context of neuroimaging data gathered during a motor
learning paradigm, where edges are task-based functional connectivity and
annotations to each node are beta weights from a general linear model that
encoded a linear decrease in blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal with practice.
Interestingly, we observe that individuals who learn at a faster rate exhibit
the greatest dissimilarity between functional connectivity and activation
magnitudes, suggesting that activation and functional connectivity are distinct
dimensions of neurophysiology that track behavioral change. More generally, the
tool that we develop offers an explicit, mathematically principled link between
functional activation and functional connectivity, and can readily be applied
to a other similar problems in which one set of imaging data offers network
data, and a second offers a regional attribute.

greatly improve our knowledge of the dynamics of dark energy, though for this
there is a strong theoretical preference for a cosmological constant. We assume
that dark energy is described by the so-called Effective Field Theory of Dark
Energy, which assumes that dark energy is the Goldstone boson of time
translations. Such a formalism makes it easy to ensure that our signatures are
consistent with well-established principles of physics. Since most of the
information resides at high wavenumbers, it is important to be able to make
predictions at the highest wavenumber that is possible. The Effective Field
Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) is a theoretical framework that has
allowed us to make accurate predictions in the mildly non-linear regime. In
this paper, we derive the non-linear equations that extend the EFTofLSS to
include the effect of dark energy both on the matter fields and on the biased
tracers. For the specific case of clustering quintessence, we then
perturbatively solve to cubic order the resulting non-linear equations and
construct the one-loop power spectrum of the total density contrast.

new physics at the $\mbox{MeV}$-scale. Furthermore, the para-photon of the dark
matter sector and the candidate to the so-called dark photon can also be
described in the scenario we are endeavoring to set up in this paper. In the
$Z'$-scenario, the extended Higgs sector introduces a heavy scalar whose mass
lies in the region $1.2-3.7 \, \mbox{TeV}$, while that the lower energy scale

corresponding scattering intermediated by a lightest boson in the lower scale

Mirror Twin Higgs (MTH) model that leads to interesting implications for
experiment. We consider theories in which both the standard model and mirror
neutrinos acquire masses through the familiar seesaw mechanism, but with a low
right-handed neutrino mass scale of order a few GeV. In these $\nu$MTH models,
the right-handed neutrinos leave the thermal bath while still relativistic. As
the universe expands, these particles eventually become nonrelativistic, and
come to dominate the energy density of the universe before decaying. Decays to
standard model states are preferred, with the result that the visible sector is
left at a higher temperature than the twin sector. Consequently the
contribution of the twin sector to the radiation density in the early universe
is suppressed, allowing the current bounds on this scenario to be satisfied.
However, the energy density in twin radiation remains large enough to be
discovered in future cosmic microwave background experiments. In addition, the
twin neutrinos are significantly heavier than their standard model
counterparts, resulting in a sizable contribution to the overall mass density
in neutrinos that can be detected in upcoming experiments designed to probe the
large scale structure of the universe.

mirror Twin Higgs. The softly-broken mirror symmetry relating the Standard
Model to its twin counterpart leads to significant dark radiation in tension
with BBN and CMB observations. We quantify this tension and illustrate how it
can be mitigated in several simple scenarios that alter the relative energy
densities of the two sectors while respecting the softly-broken mirror
symmetry. In particular, we consider both the out-of-equilibrium decay of a new
scalar as well as reheating in a toy model of twinned inflation, Twinflation.
In both cases the dilution of energy density in the twin sector does not merely
reconcile the existence of a mirror Twin Higgs with cosmological constraints,
but predicts contributions to cosmological observables that may be probed in
current and future CMB experiments. This raises the prospect of discovering
evidence of neutral naturalness through cosmology rather than colliders.

are presented. Motivated by recent results, these two models include the
contribution of a stellar thin disc and of a thick disc, as massive as the thin
counterpart but with a shorter scale-length. Both models satisfy a number of
observational constraints: stellar densities at the solar vicinity, thin and
thick disc scale lengths and heights, rotation curve(s), and the absolute value
of the perpendicular force Kz as a function of distance to the Galactic centre.
We numerically integrate into these new models the motion of all Galactic
globular clusters for which distances, proper motions, and radial velocities
are available, and the orbits of about one thousand stars in the solar
vicinity. The retrieved orbital characteristics are compared to those obtained
by integrating the clusters and stellar orbits in pure thin disc models. We
find that, due to the possible presence of a thick disc, the computed orbital
parameters of disc stars can vary by as much as 30-40%. We also show that the
systematic uncertainties that affect the rotation curve still plague computed
orbital parameters of globular clusters by similar amounts.

the orbital angular momentum of the proton. We investigate to which extent a
relationship of this kind is corroborated by the experiment, through a
systematic comparison between expectations based on models and predictions
obtained from a global analysis of hard-scattering data in perturbative Quantum
Chromodynamics. We find that the data allows the angular momentum of the proton
to be proportional to its sea asymmetry, though with a rather large range of
the optimal values of the proportionality coefficient. Typical values do not
enable us to discriminate among expectations based on different models. In
order to make our comparison conclusive, the extrapolation uncertainties on the
proportionality coefficient should be reduced, hopefully by means of accurate
measurements in the region of small proton momentum fractions, where the data
is currently lacking. Nevertheless, the unquenched quark model predicts that
quarks account for a proton spin fraction much larger than that accepted by the
conventional wisdom. We explicitly demonstrate that such a discrepancy can be
reabsorbed in the unknown extrapolation region, without affecting the
description of current data, by imposing the unquenched quark model expectation
as a boundary condition in the analysis of the data itself. We delineate how
the experimental programs at current and future facilities may shed light on
the region of small momentum fractions.

through the analysis of its Rossiter-McLaughlin effect can be used to measure
the differential rotation of the host star and the true obliquity of the
system. Highly misaligned systems could be particularly conducive to these
mesurements, which is why we reanalysed the HARPS transit spectra of WASP-8b
using the 'Rossiter-McLaughlin effect reloaded' (reloaded RM) technique. This
approach allows us to isolate the local stellar CCF emitted by the
planet-occulted regions. As a result we identified a $\sim$35% variation in the
local CCF contrast along the transit chord, which might trace a deepening of
the stellar lines from the equator to the poles. Whatever its origin, such an
effect cannot be detected when analyzing the RV centroids of the
disk-integrated CCFs through a traditional velocimetric analysis of the RM
effect. Consequently it injected a significant bias into the results obtained
by Queloz et al. (2010) for the projected rotational velocity $v_{eq} \sin
i_{\star}$ (1.59$\stackrel{+0.08}{_{-0.09}}$ km/s) and the sky-projected
obliquity $\lambda$ (-123.0$\stackrel{+3.4}{_{-4.4}}^{\circ}$). Using our
technique, we measured these values to be $v_{eq} \sin i_{\star}$ =
1.90$\pm$0.05 km/s and $\lambda$ = -143.0$\stackrel{+1.6}{_{-1.5}}^{\circ}$. We
found no compelling evidence for differential rotation of the star, although
there are hints that WASP-8 is pointing away from us with the stellar poles
rotating about 25% slower than the equator. Measurements at higher accuracy
during ingress/egress will be required to confirm this result. In contrast to
the traditional analysis of the RM effect, the reloaded RM technique directly
extracts the local stellar CCFs, allowing us to analyze their shape and to
measure their RV centroids, unbiased by variations in their contrast or FWHM.

free-free emission in the near-infrared but no evidence for warm dust. Their
most important and defining characteristic is the S Dor-type variability. 3.
The warm hypergiants spectroscopically resemble both the LBVs in their eruption
or dense wind state and the B[e] supergiants. However, they are very dusty.
Some have [Fe II] and [O I] emission in their spectra like the sgB[e] stars,

longer recurrence times and larger ignition masses. By contrast, we find that
the enhancement in the direct three-body rate at temperatures below $T \lesssim

Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) is the inherent rarity of catching an AGN during its
strong outburst phase. This is exacerbated by the ambiguity of differentiating
between AGN and clusters in X-ray observations. If there is evidence for an AGN
then the X-ray emission is commonly assumed to be dominated by the AGN
emission, introducing a selection effect against the detection of AGN in BCGs.
In order to recover these 'missing' clusters, we systematically investigate the
colour-magnitude relation around some ~3500 ROSAT All Sky Survey selected AGN,
looking for signs of a cluster red sequence. Amongst our 22 candidate systems,
we independently rediscover several confirmed systems, where a strong AGN
resides in a central galaxy. We compare the X-ray luminosity to red sequence
richness distribution of our AGN candidate systems with that of a similarly
selected comparison sample of ~1000 confirmed clusters and identify seven
'best' candidates (all of which are BL Lac objects), where the X-ray flux is
likely to be a comparable mix between cluster and AGN emission. We confirm that
the colours of the red sequence are consistent with the redshift of the AGN,
that the colours of the AGN host galaxy are consistent with AGN, and, by
comparing their luminosities with those from our comparison clusters, confirm
that the AGN hosts are consistent with BCGs.

arranged on the blown-up sphere of a warped resolved conifold in a way that
they are separated from the other set of branes that control the IR behavior of
the theory. This separation of the branes and the anti-branes creates
instability in the theory. Further complications arise from the curvature of
the ambient space. We show that, despite these analytical hurdles, stability
may still be achieved by switching on appropriate world-volume fluxes on the
branes. The UV degrees of freedom, on the other hand, modify the RG flow in the

UV conformal. Finally we lay down a calculational scheme to study bulk
viscosity which, in turn, would signal the inherent non-conformality in this

reproduce stable oscillatory spike rate dynamics that is generated by recurrent

common phenomenon in software development in practice. There have been several
empirical studies on the effects of cloning, but there are contradictory
results regarding the connection of cloning and faults. Objective: Our aim is
to clarify the relationship between code clones and faults. In particular, we
focus on inconsistent (or type-3) clones in this work. Method: We conducted a
case study with TWT GmbH where we detected the code clones in three Java
systems, set them into relation to information from issue tracking and version
control and interviewed three key developers. Results: Of the type-3 clones, 17
% contain faults. Developers modified most of the type-3 clones simultaneously
and thereby fixed half of the faults in type-3 clones consistently. Type-2
clones with faults all evolved to fixed type-3 clones. Clone length is only
weakly correlated with faultiness. Conclusion: There are indications that the
developers in two cases have been aware of clones. It might be a reason for the
weak relationship between type-3 clones and faults. Hence, it seems important
to keep developers aware of clones, potentially with new tool support. Future
studies need to investigate if the rate of faults in type-3 clones justifies
using them as cues in defect detection.

producers impose significant externalities on non-renewable energy producers.
This is because consumers are generally guaranteed electricity within certain
load parameters. The intermittent nature of production by renewable energy
producers implies that they rely on non-renewable producers so that the
aggregate power delivered meets the promised quality of service. This implicit
insurance provided by the non-renewable power sector to consumers is not
currently priced and leads to an often ignored, hidden monetary transfer from
non-renewable producers to renewable producers. As the fraction of energy
supplied by renewable resources increases, these externalities also increase.
In this paper, we quantify these externalities by developing the market
clearing price of energy in the presence of renewable energy. We consider a
day-ahead electricity market where renewable and non-renewable generators bid
by proposing their asking price per unit of energy to an independent system
operator (ISO). The ISO's problem is a multi-stage stochastic optimization
problem to dispatch energy from each generator to minimize the cost of
purchased energy on behalf of the consumers. We incorporate the notion of load
variance using the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVAR) measure in the day-ahead
electricity market to ensure that the generators are able to meet the load
within a desired confidence level. We analytically derive the market clearing
price of energy as a function of CVAR. It is shown that a higher penetration
level of the renewable energies may increase the market clearing price of
energy.

modestly easy within 3 sigma uncertainty. Incorporating the nominal observed

approach the base of the red supergiant branch (RSB), having crossed the
Hertzsprung gap, but not yet having ascended the RSB and most violate even
generous error bars on R, Teff and L. Models at the tip of the RSB typically
rotate at only ~0.1 km/s, independent of any reasonable choice of initial
rotation. We discuss the possible uncertainties in our modeling and the
observations, including the distance to Betelgeuse, the rotation velocity, and
model parameters. We summarize various options to account for the rotational
velocity and suggest that one possibility is that Betelgeuse merged with a
companion star of about 1 Msun as it ascended the RSB, in the process producing
the ring structure observed at about 7' away. A past coalescence would
complicate attempts to understand the evolutionary history and future of

features of solid-state HHG such as the linear cutoff-energy scaling and the
sudden transition from a single- to multiple-plateau structure. Based on the
simulation results, we propose a simple model that incorporates
vector-potential-induced intraband displacement, interband tunneling, and
recombination with the valence-band hole. One key parameter is the
valley-to-peak amplitude of the pulse vector potential, which determines the
crystal momentum displacement during the half cycle. When the maximum
peak-to-valley amplitude $A_{\rm peak}$ reaches the half width $\frac{\pi}{a}$
of the Brillouin zone with $a$ being the lattice constant, the HHG spectrum
exhibits a transition from a single- to multiple-plateau structure, and even
further plateaus appear at $A_{\rm peak} = \frac{2\pi}{a}, \frac{3\pi}{a},
\cdots$. The multiple cutoff positions are given as functions of $A_{\rm peak}$
and the second maximum $A_{\rm peak}^{\prime}$, in terms of the energy
difference between different bands. Using our recipe, one can draw electron
trajectories in the momentum space, from which one can deduce, for example, the
time-frequency structure of HHG without elaborate quantum-mechanical
calculations. Finally, we reveal that the cutoff positions depend on not only
the intensity and wavelength of the pulse, but also its duration, in marked
contrast to the gas-phase case. Our model can be viewed as a solid-state and
momentum-space counterpart of the familiar three-step model, highly successful
for gas-phase HHG, and provide a unified basis to understand HHG from
solid-state materials and gaseous media.

overwhelming fraction of performance for the complex-valued Gemm kernels, along
with the entire level-3 BLAS and many of the real and complex LAPACK routines.
Thus,achieving high performance for the Gemm kernel translates into a high
performance linear algebra stack above this kernel. However, it is a monumental
task for a domain expert to manually implement the kernel for every

Our basic idea is to exploit a small least squares solve to apply periodicity
without ever handling periodic Green's functions. We exhibit fast solvers for
the two-dimensional (2D) doubly-periodic Neumann Laplace problem (flow around
insulators), and Stokes non-slip fluid flow problem, that for inclusions with
smooth boundaries achieve 12-digit accuracy, and can handle thousands of
inclusions per unit cell. We split the infinite sum over the lattice of images
into a directly-summed ""near"" part plus a small number of auxiliary sources
which represent the (smooth) remaining ""far"" contribution. Applying physical
boundary conditions on the unit cell walls gives an expanded linear system,
which, after a rank-1 or rank-3 correction and a Schur complement, leaves a
well-conditioned square system which can be solved iteratively using fast
multipole acceleration plus a low-rank term. We are rather explicit about the
consistency and nullspaces of both the continuous and discretized problems. The
scheme is simple (no lattice sums, Ewald methods, nor particle meshes are
required), allows adaptivity, and is essentially dimension- and
PDE-independent, so would generalize without fuss to 3D and to other
non-oscillatory elliptic problems such as elastostatics. We incorporate
recently developed spectral quadratures that accurately handle

"1611.08039","Steffen Borgwardt","Steffen Borgwardt and Tamon Stephen and Timothy Yusun","On the Circuit Diameter Conjecture",,,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  From the point of view of optimization, a critical issue is relating the
combinatorial diameter of a polyhedron to its number of facets $f$ and
dimension $d$. In the seminal paper of Klee and Walkup [KW67], the Hirsch
conjecture of an upper bound of $f-d$ was shown to be equivalent to several
seemingly simpler statements, and was disproved for unbounded polyhedra through
the construction of a particular 4-dimensional polyhedron $U_4$ with 8 facets.
The Hirsch bound for bounded polyhedra was only recently disproved by Santos.
  We consider analogous properties for a variant of the combinatorial diameter
called the circuit diameter. In this variant, the walks are built from the
circuit directions of the polyhedron, which are the minimal non-trivial
solutions to the system defining the polyhedron.
  We are able to prove that circuit variants of the so-called non-revisiting
conjecture and $d$-step conjecture both imply the circuit analogue of the
Hirsch conjecture. For the equivalences in [KW67], the wedge construction was a
fundamental proof technique. We exhibit why it is not available in the circuit
setting, and what are the implications of losing it as a tool.
  Further, we show the circuit analogue of the non-revisiting conjecture
implies a linear bound on the circuit diameter of all unbounded polyhedra - in
contrast to what is known for the combinatorial diameter. Finally, we give two
proofs of a circuit version of the $4$-step conjecture. These results offer
some hope that the circuit version of the Hirsch conjecture may hold in
general.
  A challenge in the circuit setting is that different realizations of
polyhedra of the same combinatorial structure may have different diameters. We
adapt the notion of simplicity to work with circuits in the form of C-simple
and wedge-simple polyhedra. We show that it suffices to consider such
polyhedra.

peak in the reconstructed data set. When fitting for the full shape of the 2D
correlation function we use a multipole expansion to compare with theory. When
we use the reconstructed data we marginalise over the shape and just measure
the position of the BAO peak, analysing the data in wedges separating the
signal along the line of sight from that parallel to the line of sight. We
verify our method with mock data and find the results to be free of bias or
systematic offsets. We also redo the pre-reconstruction angle averaged (1D)
WiggleZ BAO analysis with an improved covariance and present an updated result.
The final results are presented in the form of $\Omega_c h^2$, $H(z)$, and
$D_A(z)$ for three redshift bins with effective redshifts $z = 0.44$, $0.60$,

energy barrier in order for a first-order phase transition between the
metastable and the stable phases to take place. In the liquid-to-solid
transition the process occurs between phases of different symmetry, and it is
thus inherently a multi-dimensional process, in which all symmetries are broken
at the transition. In this Focus Article, we consider some recent studies which
highlight the multi-dimensional nature of the nucleation process. Even for a
single-component system, the formation of solid crystals from the metastable
melt involves fluctuations of two (or more) order parameters, often associated
with the decoupling of positional and orientational symmetry breaking. In other
words, we need at least two order parameters to describe the free-energy of a
system including its liquid and crystalline states. This decoupling occurs
naturally for asymmetric particles or directional interactions, focusing here
on the case of water, but we will show that it also affects spherically
symmetric interacting particles, such as the hard-sphere system. We will show
how the treatment of nucleation as a multi-dimensional process has shed new
light on the process of polymorph selection, on the effect of external fields
on the nucleation process, and on glass-forming ability.

Fermi LAT observations for 3C 273 and PKS 0637-752 give the upper limit far
below the model prediction. Synchrotron emission from a separate electron
population with multi-hundred TeV energies remains a possibility although its
origin is not well known. We examine a photo-hadronic origin of such high
energy electrons/positrons, assuming that protons are accelerated up to
$10^{19}$ eV and produce electrons/positrons through Bethe-Heitler process and
photo-pion production. These secondary electrons/positrons are injected at
sufficiently high energies and produce X-rays and $\gamma$-rays by synchrotron
radiation without conflicting with the Fermi LAT upper limits. We find that the
resultant spectrum well reproduces the X-ray observations from PKS 0637-752, if
the proton power is at least $10^{49} \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1}$, which is
highly super-Eddington. It is noted that the X-ray emission originates
primarily from leptons through Bethe-Heitler process, while leptons from
photo-pion origin lose energy directly through synchrotron emission of
multi-TeV photons rather than cascading. To avoid the overproduction of the
optical flux, optical emission is primarily due to synchrotron emission of
secondary leptons rather than primary electrons, or a mild degree of beaming of
the jet is needed, if it is owing to the primary electrons. Proton synchrotron
luminosity is a few orders of magnitude smaller.

of the three-strand braid group that models the Jones polynomial for closures
of three-strand braids. This invariant is a quantum model for the Jones
polynomial restricted to three strand braids, and it does not involve quantum
entanglement. These relationships between topological braiding and quantum
entanglement can be used as a framework for future work in understanding the
properties of entangling gates in topological quantum computing.The paper ends

knots and quantum entanglement, and the ER = EPR hypothesis about the
relationship of quantum entanglement with the connectivity of space. We

construct a new topological space, that welds the network and the background

Supernova Program (DES-SN). Some models predict KNe to be redder,
shorter-lived, and dimmer than supernovae (SNe), but at present the event rate
of KNe is poorly constrained. We simulate observations of KN and SN light
curves with the Monte-Carlo simulation code SNANA to optimize selection
requirements, determine search efficiency, and predict SN backgrounds. We also
perform an analysis using fake point sources on images to account for anomalous
efficiency losses from difference-imaging on bright low-redshift galaxies. Our
analysis of the first two seasons of DES-SN data results in 0 events, and is
consistent with our prediction of 1.1 background events based on simulations of
SN. Given our simulation prediction, there is a 33 percent chance of finding 0
events in the data. Assuming no underlying galaxy flux, our search sets 90
percent upper limits on the KN volumetric rate of $1.0\times10^7$ Gpc$^{-3}$

the central potential and substructure peak with mass signal-to-noise of
3.5$\sigma$ and 2.3$\sigma$ respectively; and a convergence map derived
directly from the smoothed flexion field. For the primary peak we find a mass

B-splines); ii) mExp-DQM: DQM with modified exponential cubic B-splines, and
iii) MTB-DQM: DQM with modified trigonometric cubic B-splines. Specially, we
implement these methods on convection-diffusion equation to convert them into a
system of first order ordinary differential equations,in time which can be
solved using any time integration method, while we prefer SSP-RK54 scheme. All
the three methods are found stable for two space convection-diffusion equation

polynomial-time $13$-approximation algorithm for the problem. For hardness

  In this paper we consider the $(1,\epsilon)$-restricted max-min fair

we also obtain a quasi-polynomial time $(3+4\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm

disorder on electrical transport in graphene Hall bars in the presence of
quantizing magnetic fields. Disorder, induced by a random distribution of
monovacancies, breaks the graphene sublattice symmetry and creates states
localized on the vacancies. These states are observable in the bend resistance,
as well as in the total DOS. Their energy is proportional to the square root of
the magnetic field, while their localization length is proportional to the
cyclotron radius. At the energies of these localized states, the electron
current flows around the monovacancies and, as we show, it can follow
unexpected paths depending on the particular arrangement of vacancies. We study
how these localized states change with the vacancy concentration, and what are
the effects of including the next nearest neighbor hopping term. Our results
are also compared with the situation when double vacancies are present in the
system. Double vacancies also induce localized states, but their energy and
magnetic field dependences are different. Their localization energy scales
linearly with the magnetic field, and their localization length appears not to
depend on the field strength.

wireless networks. Though the delay of point-to-point communications has been
well investigated, the delay of multi-point to multi-point communications has

evaluated the effect of different scheduling policies on the delay performance.
Our numerical analysis reveals that offloading policy based on cell range
expansion greatly reduces the macrocell traffic while bringing a small amount
of growth for the picocell traffic. Our results also show that the delay
performance of round-robin scheduling outperforms first in first out scheduling
for heavy traffic, and it is reversed for light traffic. In summary, this

flow proceeds through a Richardson cascade whereby larger vortices successively
decay into smaller ones. By contrast, an additional inverse cascade
characterized by vortex growth exists in 2D fluids and gases, with profound
implications for meteorological flows and fluid mixing. The possibility of a
helicity-driven inverse cascade in 3D fluids had been rejected in the 1970s
based on equilibrium-thermodynamic arguments. Recently, however, it was
proposed that certain symmetry-breaking processes could potentially trigger a
3D inverse cascade, but no physical system exhibiting this phenomenon has been
identified to date. Here, we present analytical and numerical evidence for the
existence of an inverse energy cascade in an experimentally validated 3D active
fluid model, describing microbial suspension flows that spontaneously break
mirror symmetry. We show analytically that self-organized scale selection, a

fixed point condition required for the T-duality twist restricts the possible
Lie algebras. When the T-duality acts as a simple chiral reflection, one is
left with the four cases, $A_1, D_{2r}, E_7, E_8$, among the simple
simply-laced algebras. From the corresponding Englert-Neveu lattices, we
construct the modular invariant partition functions for the T-fold CFTs in
bosonic string theory. Similar construction is possible also by using Euclidean
even self-dual lattices. We then apply our formulation to the T-folds in the
$E_8 \times E_8$ heterotic string theory. Incorporating non-trivial phases for
the T-duality twist, we obtain, as simple examples, a class of modular
invariant partition functions parametrized by three integers. Our construction
includes the cases which are not reduced to the free fermion construction.

evaluating their strengths and weaknesses. This paper describes our initial
contribution towards constructing such a benchmark. To locate real resource
leak bugs, we mined 124,215 code revisions of 34 large-scale open-source
Android apps. We successfully found 298 fixed resource leaks, which cover a
diverse set of resource classes, from 32 out of the 34 apps. To understand the
characteristics of these bugs, we conducted an empirical study, which revealed
the root causes of frequent resource leaks in Android apps and common patterns
of faults made by developers. With our findings, we further implemented a
static checker to detect a common pattern of resource leaks in Android apps.
Experiments showed that the checker can effectively locate real resource leaks

system shows noise utilisation through its inherent plasticity. The
fluctuations propagation takes place using the phosphotransfer module and the
feedback mechanism during gene regulation. To delicately observe the noisy
kinetics the generic cascade needs stochastic investigation at the mRNA and
protein levels. To this end, we propose a theoretical framework to investigate
the noisy signal transduction in a generic two-component system. The model
shows reliability in information transmission through quantification of several
statistical measures. We further extend our analysis to observe the protein
distribution in a population of cells. Through numerical simulation, we
identify the regime of the kinetic parameter set that generates a stability
switch in the steady state distribution of proteins. The results of our
theoretical analysis show key features of the network. The noise permeation and
information propagation in the autoregulation module is feeble. However, the
phosphotransfer module compensates such weakness and plays a significant role
in information transmission. The bimodality due to fluctuations pampers the
emergence of persistence in an isogenic bacterial pool.

hardware-dependent implementation of network functions (i.e., middleboxes) into
software modules running on virtualized platforms, for significant cost
reduction and ease of management. Such virtual network functions (VNFs)
commonly constitute service chains, to provide network services that traffic
flows need to go through. Efficient deployment of VNFs for network service
provisioning is key to realize the NFV goals. Existing efforts on VNF placement
mostly deal with offline or one-time placement, ignoring the fundamental,
dynamic deployment and scaling need of VNFs to handle practical time-varying
traffic volumes. This work investigates dynamic placement of VNF service chains
across geo-distributed datacenters to serve flows between dispersed source and
destination pairs, for operational cost minimization of the service chain
provider over the entire system span. An efficient online algorithm is
proposed, which consists of two main components: (1) A regularization-based
approach from online learning literature to convert the offline optimal
deployment problem into a sequence of one-shot regularized problems, each to be
efficiently solved in one time slot; (2) An online dependent rounding scheme to
derive feasible integer solutions from the optimal fractional solutions of the
one-shot problems, and to guarantee a good competitive ratio of the online
algorithm over the entire time span. We verify our online algorithm with solid
theoretical analysis and trace-driven simulations under realistic settings.

the case of social networks, on the scale of billions), and are natural targets
for machine learning techniques. In particular, we would like to use deep
neural networks, which have recently proven to be powerful tools for a broad
range of problems from computer vision, natural language processing, and audio
analysis. However, these tools have been most successful on data with an
underlying Euclidean or grid-like structure, and in cases where the invariances
of these structures are built into networks used to model them. Geometric deep
learning is an umbrella term for emerging techniques attempting to generalize
(structured) deep neural models to non-Euclidean domains such as graphs and

geometric deep learning problems and present available solutions, key

by approximate methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Gibbs sampling.
An MLN has many regular, symmetric structures that can be exploited at both

consider the derivative expansion, a systematic expansion in powers of field

relevant case of a curved metric with Lorentzian signature. The method is
illustrated with a detailed discussion of the so-called local potential
approximation prime which, on top of the full effective potential, includes a
running (but field-independent) field renormalization. We explicitly compute
the associated anomalous dimension for O(N) theories. We find that it can take
large values along the flow, leading to sizable differences as compared to the
local potential approximation. However, it does not prevent the phenomenon of
gravitationally induced dimensional reduction pointed out in previous studies.
We show that, as a consequence, the effective potential at the end of the flow
is unchanged as compared to the local potential approximation, the main effect
of the running anomalous dimension being merely to slow down the flow.

given a large scale weakly labeled dataset in which each face image is

each identity with edges linking matched faces verified by the existing model
under a tight threshold. Then we use the maximal subgraph as the cleaned data

the study of face recognition. By running the filtering process, we obtain a
cleaned datasets (99.7+% purity) of size 223,767 (recall 70.9%). On our testing

sequence to help students learn knowledge concepts efficiently. However,
existing methods such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and Deep Knowledge Tracing
either model knowledge state for each predefined concept separately or fail to
pinpoint exactly which concepts a student is good at or unfamiliar with. To
solve these problems, this work introduces a new model called Dynamic Key-Value
Memory Networks (DKVMN) that can exploit the relationships between underlying
concepts and directly output a student's mastery level of each concept. Unlike
standard memory-augmented neural networks that facilitate a single memory
matrix or two static memory matrices, our model has one static matrix called
key, which stores the knowledge concepts and the other dynamic matrix called
value, which stores and updates the mastery levels of corresponding concepts.
Experiments show that our model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
model in a range of KT datasets. Moreover, the DKVMN model can automatically
discover underlying concepts of exercises typically performed by human
annotations and depict the changing knowledge state of a student.

coupled quantum anomalous Hall layers. By slowly modulating the model
parameters, it is possible to transfer one unit of Chern number from the bottom

order (NLO) QCD corrections to the hadro-production of heavy neutral Higgs
bosons and their decay into top-quark pairs within the type-II
two-Higgs-doublet extension of the standard model (SM). We take into account
the contributions from resonant Higgs boson production, the non-resonant SM
$t\bar{t}$ background as well as the interference of these two contributions.
The NLO corrections to the signal and interference contributions are calculated
by applying the heavy top-quark mass ($m_t$) limit including an effective
rescaling. In our NLO calculation the QCD-Higgs interference is evaluated in
the resonance region that provides the dominant part of the heavy Higgs-boson
contributions. Evaluating representative $CP$-conserving and $CP$-violating
parameter scenarios within the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) we present
results for different distributions and, in addition, for observables that
depend on the top-quark spin.

This protocol reduces disturbances due to the early time measurements to a

polycrystalline Au and Ag were used as noble-metals, whereas, H passivated and
SiO2 terminated Si (100) were used as dielectric substrates. Angle dependent
near edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) was employed to
understand the molecular conformation whereas atomic force microscopy (AFM) was
used to investigate the surface morphologies of the films. X-ray absorption
spectra (XAS) of rubrene molecules with flat and twisted conformations were
calculated using density functional theory (DFT). All the observed NEXAFS
spectra of rubrene thin films at various thicknesses and onto different

intensity from the twisted and the flat molecules. In contrast to general
findings, comparatively rough polycrystalline Ag surface is found to support
growth of better quality rubrene films. The results have important implications

Idealized tubular templates are constructed that match airway probability
obtained from a trained classifier and ranked based on their relative
significance. Several such regularly spaced templates form the local hypotheses
used in constructing a multiple hypothesis tree, which is then traversed to
reach decisions. The proposed modifications remove the need for local
thresholding of hypotheses as decisions are made entirely based on statistical
comparisons involving the hypothesis tree. The results show improvements in
performance when compared to the original method and region growing on
intensity images. We also compare the method with region growing on the

detail the minor perturbative contributions to the trajectory of spacecraft
performing a flyby manoeuvre. This anomaly consist of an unexplained increase

Earth in the range of a few mm per second. Some order of magnitude estimations
have been performed in recent years to dismiss many possible conventional
effects as the source of such an anomaly but no explanation has been found yet.
In this paper we perform a study of the perturbation induced by ocean tides in
a flybying spacecraft by considering the time dependence of the location of the
high tide as the Moon follows its orbit. We show that this effect implies a
change of the spacecraft velocity of a few micrometers per second.
  We also consider the coupling of tesseral harmonics inhomogeneities and the
rotation of the Earth and its impact of the spacecraft outgoing velocity.
Significant corrections to the observed asymptotic velocities are found in this
case but neither their sign nor their magnitude coincide with the anomalies.
So, we can also rule this out as a conventional explanation.

  Congress and Learned to Build a Little One for Myself","22 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.CY cs.DL cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Twitter is among the commonest sources of data employed in social media
research mainly because of its convenient APIs to collect tweets. However, most
researchers do not have access to the expensive Firehose and Twitter Historical
Archive, and they must rely on data collected with free APIs whose
representativeness has been questioned. In 2010 the Library of Congress
announced an agreement with Twitter to provide researchers access to the whole
Twitter Archive. However, such a task proved to be daunting and, at the moment
of this writing, no researcher has had the opportunity to access such
materials. Still, there have been experiences that proved that smaller
searchable archives are feasible and, therefore, amenable for academics to
build with relatively little resources. In this paper I describe my efforts to
build one of such archives, covering the first three years of Twitter (actually
from March 2006 to July 2009) and containing 1.48 billion tweets. If you
carefully follow my directions you may have your very own little Twitter
Historical Archive and you may forget about paying for historical tweets.
Please note that to achieve that you should be proficient in some programming
language, knowable about Twitter APIs, and have some basic knowledge on
ElasticSearch; moreover, you may very well get disappointed by the quality of
the contents of the final dataset.

of particular systems. Especially for large systems this can be a daunting
task. Detailed interventional and randomized data sampling approaches can be
used to resolve the causality question, but for many systems such interventions
are impossible or too costly to obtain. Recently, Maathuis et al. (2010),
following ideas from Spirtes et al. (2000), introduced a framework to estimate
causal effects in large scale Gaussian systems. By describing the causal
network as a directed acyclic graph it is a possible to estimate a class of
Markov equivalent systems that describe the underlying causal interactions
consistently, even for non-Gaussian systems. In these systems, causal effects
stop being linear and cannot be described any more by a single coefficient. In
this paper, we derive the general functional form of causal effect in a large
subclass of non-Gaussian distributions, called the non- paranormal. We also
derive a convenient approximation, which can be used effectively in estimation.
We apply the method to an observational gene expression dataset.

as described thus far, ignores velocity dispersion from the chirp in the
undulator, taking the limit of a `small' chirp. In the following, the physics
of compensating for chirp in the beam is revisited, including the effects of
velocity dispersion, or beam compression or decompression, in the undulator. It
is found that the limit of negligible velocity dispersion in the undulator is
different from that previously identified as the small chirp limit, and is more
significant than previously considered. The velocity dispersion requires a
taper which is non-linear to properly compensate for the effects of the
detuning, and also results in a varying peak current (end thus a varying gain
length) over the length of the undulator. The results may be especially
significant for plasma driven FELs and low energy linac driven FEL test

reflects the interactions with other molecules, membranes, cells, and in
general the interactions with the environment. Microstructural changes as e.g.
cellular organization and/or integrity then affect the motion of water
molecules, and consequently alter the water diffusion properties measured by
DWI. Then DWI technique can be used to extract information about tissue
organization at the cellular level indirectly from water motion. In general the
signal intensity in DWI can be quantified by using a parameter known as ADC
(Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) emphasizing that it is not the real diffusion
coefficient, which is a measure of the average water molecular motion. In the
simplest models, the distribu- tion of a water molecule diffusing in a certain
period of time is considered to have a Gaussian form with its width
proportional to the ADC. However, water in biological structures often displays
non-Gaussian diffusion behavior, consequently the DWI signal shows a more
complex behavior that need to be modeled following different approaches. In
this work we explore the possibility to quantify the degree to which water
diffusion in biologic tissues is non-Gaussian introducing the AKC parameter
(Apparent Kurtosis Coefficient). In this work we have realized DWI non-Gaussian

atmosphere requires a good estimate of the particle energy deposition in the
middle atmosphere (60- 100 km) and how the energy is distributed globally.
Protons in the energy range 1-20MeV, depositing their energy in the middle
atmosphere, are subject to more complex dynamics with strong day-night
asymmetries compared to higher-energy particles. Our study targets six SPEs
from 2003 to 2012. By using measurements from the Medium Energy Proton and
Electron Detector on all available Polar Orbit Environment Satellites (POES),
we show that in the main phase of geomagnetic storms the dayside cutoff
latitudes are pushed poleward, while the nightside cutoff latitudes have the
opposite response, resulting in strong day-night asymmetries in the energy
deposition. These features cannot bemeasured by the frequently used
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Assuming that the
protons impact the polar atmosphere homogeneously above a fixed nominal
latitude boundary will therefore give a significant overestimate of the energy
deposited in the middle atmosphere during SPEs. We discuss the magnetospheric
mechanisms responsible for the local time response in the cutoff latitudes and
provide a simple applicable parameterization which includes both dayside and
nightside cutoff latitude variability using only the Dst, the northward
component of the interplanetary magnetic field, and solar wind pressure. The
parameterization is utilized on the GOES particle fluxes, and the resulting
energy deposition successfully captures the day-night asymmetry in good
agreement with the energy deposition predicted from the POES measurement.

are the Sp\""orer catalog and observations of the Paris observatory, which cover
in total the last quarter of the 17th and the first two decades of the 18th
century.
  These data, in particular, contain information about sunspot latitudes. As we
showed in previous papers, dispersions of sunspot latitude distributions are
tightly related to sunspot indices, so we can estimate the level of solar
activity in this epoch by a method which is not based on direct calculation of
sunspots and is weakly affected by loss of observational data.
  The latitude distributions of sunspots in the time of transition from the
Maunder minimum to the common regime of solar activity proved to be wide
enough. It gives evidences in favor of, first, not very low cycle No. -3
(1712-1723) with the Wolf number in maximum W=$100\pm50$, and, second, nonzero
activity in the maximum of cycle No. -4 (1700-1711) W=$60\pm45$.
  Therefore, the latitude distributions in the end of the Maunder minimum are
in better agreement with the traditional Wolf number and new revisited indices
of activity SN and GN than with the GSN; the latter provide much lower level of
activity in this epoch.

two such image representations are compared with the dot-product, the

  We formalise this problem and propose two related solutions, both aimed at
equalising the individual contributions of the local descriptors in the final
representation. These methods modify the aggregation stage by including a set
of per-descriptor weights. They differ by the objective function that is
optimised to compute those weights. The first is a ""democratisation"" strategy

metals and a transition between two dominant atomistic mechanisms of
deformation. Metals tend to exhibit bi-stable friction behavior -- low and
converging or high and diverging. These general trends in behavior are shown to
be largely explained using a simplified model based on grain size evolution, as
a function of contact stress and temperature, and are demonstrated for pure
copper and gold. Specifically, the low friction regime is linked to the
formation of ultra-nanocrystalline surface films (10 to 20 nm), driving toward
shear accommodation by grain boundary sliding. Above a critical combination of
stress and temperature -- demonstrated to be a material property -- shear
accommodation transitions to dislocation dominated plasticity and high
friction. We utilize a combination of experimental and computational methods to
develop and validate the proposed structure-property relationship. This
quantitative framework provides a shift from phenomenological to mechanistic
and predictive fundamental understanding of friction for crystalline materials,

challenges way beyond the borders of ordinary statistical physics. The lack of
concepts like scaling and renormalization is particularly grievous, as it
forces us to negotiate with scores of details whose relevance is often hard to
assess. In an attempt to improve on this situation, we present here
experimental evidence of the emergence of dynamic scaling laws in natural
swarms. We find that spatio-temporal correlation functions in different swarms
can be rescaled by using a single characteristic time, which grows with the
correlation length with a dynamical critical exponent z~1. We run simulations
of a model of self-propelled particles in its swarming phase and find z~2,
suggesting that natural swarms belong to a novel dynamic universality class.
This conclusion is strengthened by experimental evidence of non-exponential
relaxation and paramagnetic spin-wave remnants, indicating that previously
overlooked inertial effects are needed to describe swarm dynamics. The absence
of a purely relaxational regime suggests that natural swarms are subject to a
near-critical censorship of hydrodynamics.

each user feeds back multiple selected received signal directions with high

subset of users to be served simultaneously, balancing between sum-rate
performance and fairness, but becomes untractable in dense network scenarios
where many users send simultaneous requests. Therefore, we develop a
sub-optimal scheduler that greatly decreases the complexity while preserving a
near-optimal data rate gain. More interestingly, our simulations show that the
IA scheme becomes valuable only in correlated channels, whereas the matched
filtering based scheme performs the best in the uncorrelated scenarios.

the lack of standard stars, flat fielding for large field of view, and
variation of reddening between different stars especially at low galactic
latitudes etc. Poor selection, bad spectral quality, or extinction uncertainty
of standard stars not only might induce errors to the calculated spectral
response curve (SRC), but also might lead to failures in producing final 1D
spectra. In this paper, we inspected spectra with Galactic latitude |b|>=60
degree and reliable stellar parameters, determined through the LAMOST Stellar
Parameter Pipeline (LASP), to study the stability of the spectrograph. To
guarantee the selected stars had been observed by each fiber, we selected
37,931 high quality exposures of 29,000 stars from LAMOST DR2, and more than 7
exposures for each fiber. We calculated the SRCs for each fiber for each
exposure, and calculated the statistics of SRCs for spectrographs with both the
fiber variations and time variations. The result shows that the average
response curve of each spectrograph (henceforth ASPSRC) is relatively stable
with statistical errors <= 10%. From the comparison between each ASPSRC and the
SRCs for the same spectrograph obtained by 2D pipeline, we find that the
ASPSRCs are good enough to use for the calibration. The ASPSRCs have been
applied to spectra which were abandoned by LAMOST 2D pipeline due to the lack
of standard stars, increasing the number of LAMOST spectra by 52,181 in DR2.
Comparing those same targets with SDSS, the relative flux differences between
SDSS spectra and that of LAMOST spectra with the ASPSRC method are less than
10%, which underlines that the ASPSRC method is feasible for LAMOST flux
calibration.

potential risk from a misbehaving AI system is the ability to turn the system
off. As the capabilities of AI systems improve, it is important to ensure that
such systems do not adopt subgoals that prevent a human from switching them
off. This is a challenge because many formulations of rational agents create
strong incentives for self-preservation. This is not caused by a built-in
instinct, but because a rational agent will maximize expected utility and
cannot achieve whatever objective it has been given if it is dead. Our goal is
to study the incentives an agent has to allow itself to be switched off. We
analyze a simple game between a human H and a robot R, where H can press R's
off switch but R can disable the off switch. A traditional agent takes its
reward function for granted: we show that such agents have an incentive to
disable the off switch, except in the special case where H is perfectly
rational. Our key insight is that for R to want to preserve its off switch, it
needs to be uncertain about the utility associated with the outcome, and to
treat H's actions as important observations about that utility. (R also has no
incentive to switch itself off in this setting.) We conclude that giving
machines an appropriate level of uncertainty about their objectives leads to
safer designs, and we argue that this setting is a useful generalization of the
classical AI paradigm of rational agents.

energy leakage (ZPEL) in highly anharmonicsystems. This is a well-known problem
in methods based on classicaltrajectories where part of the energy of the
high-frequency modes istransferred to the low-frequency modes leading to a
wrong energydistribution. In some cases, the ZPEL can have dramatic
consequences onthe properties of the system. Thus, we investigate the ZPEL by
testing theQTB method on selected systems with increasing complexity in order
to studythe conditions and the parameters that influence the leakage. We also
analyze the consequences of the ZPEL on the structuraland vibrational

the damping coefficient and thatincreasing its value can reduce and, in some
cases, completely remove the ZPEL. When using sufficiently high values for
thedamping coefficient, the expected energy distribution among the vibrational
modes is ensured. In this case, the QTB methodgives very encouraging results.
In particular, the structural properties are well-reproduced. The dynamical

that yields a sparse representation of some observed data. The dictionary
learning problem is non-convex, and usually solved via computationally complex
iterative algorithms. Furthermore, the resulting transforms obtained generally
lack structure that permits their fast application to data. To address this
issue, this paper develops a framework for learning orthonormal dictionaries
which are built from products of a few Householder reflectors. Two algorithms
are proposed to learn the reflector coefficients: one that considers a
sequential update of the reflectors and one with a simultaneous update of all
reflectors that imposes an additional internal orthogonal constraint. The
proposed methods have low computational complexity and are shown to converge to
local minimum points which can be described in terms of the spectral properties
of the matrices involved. The resulting dictionaries balance between the
computational complexity and the quality of the sparse representations by
controlling the number of Householder reflectors in their product. Simulations
of the proposed algorithms are shown in the image processing setting where
well-known fast transforms are available for comparisons. The proposed
algorithms have favorable reconstruction error and the advantage of a fast
implementation relative to the classical, unstructured, dictionaries.

representations of the data bears the name of dictionary learning. In many
applications, these learned dictionaries represent the data much better than
the static well-known transforms (Fourier, Hadamard etc.). The main downside of
learned transforms is that they lack structure and therefore they are not
computationally efficient, unlike their classical counterparts. These posse
several difficulties especially when using power limited hardware such as
mobile devices, therefore discouraging the application of sparsity techniques
in such scenarios. In this paper we construct orthogonal and non-orthogonal
dictionaries that are factorized as a product of a few basic transformations.
In the orthogonal case, we solve exactly the dictionary update problem for one
basic transformation, which can be viewed as a generalized Givens rotation, and
then propose to construct orthogonal dictionaries that are a product of these
transformations, guaranteeing their fast manipulation. We also propose a method
to construct fast square but non-orthogonal dictionaries that are factorized as
a product of few transforms that can be viewed as a further generalization of
Givens rotations to the non-orthogonal setting. We show how the proposed
transforms can balance very well data representation performance and
computational complexity. We also compare with classical fast and learned

properties of the series by computing the Hurst exponent, not only in its
original form but also under an evolutionary point of view by analyzing the
Hurst exponents over a rolling windows basis. The methodological tool adopted
for the persistence is the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), which is
classically known as suitable for our purpose. As an ancillary exploration, we
implement a control on the data validity by assessing if the data exhibit the
regularity stated by Benford's law. Results are interesting under different
viewpoints. First, we show that the Paglia river streamflow exhibits
periodicities which broadly suggest the existence of some common behaviour with
El Nino and the North Atlantic Oscillations: this specifically points to a (not
necessarily direct) effect of these oceanic phenomena on the hydrogeological
equilibria of very far geographical zones: however, such an hypothesis needs
further analyses to be validated. Second, the series of streamflows shows an
antipersistent behaviour. Third, data are not consistent with Benford's law:
this suggests that the measurement criteria should be opportunely revised.
Fourth, the streamflow distribution is well approximated by a discrete
generalized Beta distribution: this is well in accordance with the measured
streamflows being the outcome of a complex system.

robotics, are a type of linkage that can be used to raise a load to some
height, when acted upon by some force, usually exerted by an actuator. The
position of this actuator, however, can affect the mechanical advantage and
velocity ratio of the system. Hence, there needs to be a concrete way to
analytically compare different actuator positions. However, all current
research into the analysis of scissor lifts either focusses only on the screw

actuator positions to trial and error, since the expression to test the potency
of the position can only be derived once the position is chosen. This paper
proposes a derivation for a general force expression, in terms of a few

expression for any actuator position. Hence, this expression illustrates
exactly how each of the position variables (called a, b and i in this paper, as

candidates as building blocks for solid-state based quantum computation and
communication. They provide very high crystalline and optical properties and
offer a convenient geometry for electrical contacting. Having a complete
determination and full control of their emission properties is one of the key
goals of nanoscience researchers. Here we use strain as a tool to create in a
single magnetic nanowire quantum dot a light-hole exciton, an optically active
quasiparticle formed from a single electron bound to a single light hole. In
this frame, we provide a general description of the mixing within the hole
quadruplet induced by strain or confinement. A multi-instrumental combination
of cathodoluminescence, polarisation-resolved Fourier imaging and
magneto-optical spectroscopy, allow us to fully characterize the hole ground
state, including its valence band mixing with heavy hole states.

time- dependent perturbation theory, the transition rate in the present of a
minimal length based on the Kempf algebra is studied. Also, we find the
absorption cross section in the framework of GUP. The modified photoelectric
effect is investigated and we show that the differential cross section of
photoelectric effect in the frame work of GUP is related to the isotropic
minimal length scale. The upper bound on the isotropic minimal length is
estimated.

two-well systems with an arbitrary orientations of the dipoles relative to the
system's axis. The system can be built as a chain of local traps sliced into
two parallel lattices by a repelling laser sheet. It is modelled by a pair of
coupled discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equations, with dipole-dipole self- and
cross-interactions. When the dipoles are not polarized perpendicular or
parallel to the lattice, the cross-interaction is asymmetric, replacing the
familiar symmetric two-component discrete solitons by two new species of
cross-symmetric ones, on-site- and off-site-centered, which are strongly
affected by the orientation of the dipoles and separation between the parallel
lattices. A very narrow region of intermediate asymmetric discrete solitons is
found at the boundary between the on- and off-site families. Two different
types of solitons in the $\mathcal{PT}$%-symmetric version of the system are
constructed too, and stability areas are identified for them.
