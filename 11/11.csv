proposed to establish the formation with connectivity preservation for
multi-agent systems. Each agent needs to update its control input and to
broadcast this control input together with the relative state information to
its neighbors at its own triggering times, and to receive information at its
neighbors' triggering times. Two types of system dynamics, single integrators
and double integrators, are considered. As a result, all agents converge to the
formation exponentially with connectivity preservation, and Zeno behavior can
be excluded. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the theoretical
results.

them into complementary codes. One code summarizes the specified factors of

unspecified variability. During training, the only available source of
supervision comes from our ability to distinguish among different observations
belonging to the same class. Examples of such observations include images of a
set of labeled objects captured at different viewpoints, or recordings of set
of speakers dictating multiple phrases. In both instances, the intra-class
diversity is the source of the unspecified factors of variation: each object is
observed at multiple viewpoints, and each speaker dictates multiple phrases.
Learning to disentangle the specified factors from the unspecified ones becomes
easier when strong supervision is possible. Suppose that during training, we
have access to pairs of images, where each pair shows two different objects
captured from the same viewpoint. This source of alignment allows us to solve
our task using existing methods. However, labels for the unspecified factors
are usually unavailable in realistic scenarios where data acquisition is not
strictly controlled. We address the problem of disentanglement in this more
general setting by combining deep convolutional autoencoders with a form of
adversarial training. Both factors of variation are implicitly captured in the
organization of the learned embedding space, and can be used for solving
single-image analogies. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets

this approach to large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water,

coherent contribution arising from radial and angular correlations on a length
scale of < 1 nm, much shorter than had been recently hypothesized (Shelton, D.

we can also extract an effective molecular hyperpolarizability in the liquid

counting and uniform sampling. We show that for certain classes of posets,
biased Markov chains that walk along edges of their Hasse diagrams allow us to
approximately generate samples with any fixed rank in expected polynomial time.
Our arguments do not rely on the typical proofs of log-concavity, which are
used to construct a stationary distribution with a specific mode in order to
give a lower bound on the probability of outputting an element of the desired
rank. Instead, we infer this directly from bounds on the mixing time of the
chains through a method we call $\textit{balanced bias}$.
  A noteworthy application of our method is sampling restricted classes of
integer partitions of $n$. We give the first provably efficient Markov chain
algorithm to uniformly sample integer partitions of $n$ from general restricted
classes. Several observations allow us to improve the efficiency of this chain
to require $O(n^{1/2}\log(n))$ space, and for unrestricted integer partitions,
expected $O(n^{9/4})$ time. Related applications include sampling permutations

electrons residing near Bloch band extrema as an information carrier. Recent
experiments demonstrating optical generation and manipulation of exciton valley
coherence (the superposition of electron-hole pairs at opposite valleys) in
monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a critical step
towards control of this quantum degree of freedom. The charged exciton (trion)
in TMDs is an intriguing alternative to the neutral exciton for control of
valley pseudospin because of its long spontaneous recombination lifetime, its
robust valley polarization, and its coupling to residual electronic spin. Trion
valley coherence has however been unexplored due to experimental challenges in
accessing it spectroscopically. In this work, we employ ultrafast
two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy to resonantly generate and detect trion
valley coherence in monolayer MoSe$_2$ demonstrating that it persists for a
few-hundred femtoseconds. We conclude that the underlying mechanisms limiting
trion valley coherence are fundamentally different from those applicable to
exciton valley coherence. Based on these observations, we suggest possible
strategies for extending valley coherence times in two-dimensional materials.

function much below room-temperature, hence the costly cooling. Since the
discovery of Cu- and Fe-based high-temperature superconductors (HTS), much
intense effort has tried to explain and understand the superconducting
phenomenon. While no exact explanations are given, several trends are reported
in relation to the materials basis in magnetism and spin excitations. In fact,
most HTS have antiferromagnetic undoped 'parent' materials that undergo a
superconducting transition upon small chemical substitutions in them. As it is
currently unclear which 'dopants' can favor superconductivity, this manuscript
investigates crystal structure changes upon chemical substitutions, to find
clues in lattice parameters for the superconducting occurrence. We review the
chemical substitution effects on the crystal lattice of iron-arsenide-based
crystals (2008 to present). We note that (a) HTS compounds have nearly
tetragonal structures with a-lattice parameter close to 4 A, and (b)
superconductivity can depend strongly on the c-lattice parameter changes with
chemical substitution. For example, a decrease in c-lattice parameter is
required to induce 'in-plane' superconductivity. The review of lattice
parameter trends in iron-arsenides presented here should guide synthesis of new
materials and provoke theoretical input, giving clues for HTS.

Analysis (DSA). DSA provides a nonlinear dynamical basis for spatiotemporal
datasets or dynamical models, eliminating redundancies and expressing the
system in terms of the smallest number of fundamental processes and
interactions without loss of information. This optimises model design in
dynamical systems, expressing complex coevolution in simple synergistic terms,
yielding physically meaningful spatial and temporal structures. These are
extracted by spatiotemporal decomposition of nonlinearly interacting subspaces
via the novel concept of a Spatiotemporal Coevolution Manifold. Physical
consistency is ensured and mathematical ambiguities are avoided with
fundamental principles on energy minimisation and entropy production. The
relevance of DSA is illustrated by retrieving a non-redundant, synergistic set
of nonlinear geophysical processes exerting control over precipitation in space
and time over the Euro-Atlantic region. For that purpose, a nonlinear
spatiotemporal basis is extracted from geopotential data fields, yielding two
independent dynamic sources dominated respectively by meridional and zonal
circulation gradients. These sources are decomposed into spatial and temporal
structures corresponding to multiscale climate dynamics. The added value of
nonlinear predictability is brought out in the geospatial evaluation and
dynamic simulation of evolving precipitation distributions from the geophysical
controls, using DSA-driven model building and implementation. The simulated
precipitation is found to be in agreement with observational data, which they

is on homogeneous solid materials with spherical, empty voids of equal size.
The voids are arranged on crystalline lattices (SC, BCC, FCC and HCP structure)
or randomly, and may overlap in order to produce connected voids. In that way,
the entire range of void fraction between 0.00 and 0.95 is covered, including
closed-cell and open-cell structures. For each arrangement of voids and for
different void fractions the full stiffness tensor is computed. From this, the
Young's modulus and Poisson ratios are derived for different orientations.
Special care is taken of assessing and reducing the numerical uncertainty of
the method. In that way, a reliable quantitative comparison of different void
structures is carried out. Among other things, this work shows that the Young's
modulus of FCC in the (1 1 1) plane differs from HCP in the (0 0 0 1) plane,
even though these structures are very similar. For a given void fraction SC
offers the highest and the lowest Young's modulus depending on the direction.
For BCC at a critical void fraction a switch of the elastic behaviour is found,
as regards the direction in which the Young's modulus is maximised. For certain
crystalline void arrangements and certain directions Poisson ratios between 0
and 1 were found, including values that exceed the bounds for isotropic
materials. For subsequent investigations the full stiffness tensor for a range
of void arrangements and void fractions are provided in the supplemental

task relationship matrix from the weights learned from latent feature spaces of
task-specific base kernels. Unlike in previous work, the proposed formulation
allows one to incorporate prior knowledge for simultaneously learning several
related tasks. We propose an alternating minimization algorithm to learn the
model parameters, kernel weights and task relationship matrix. In order to
tackle large-scale problems, we further propose a two-stage \textit{MK-MTRL}
online learning algorithm and show that it significantly reduces the
computational time, and also achieves performance comparable to that of the
joint learning framework. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that
the proposed formulations outperform several state-of-the-art multitask
learning methods.

well above 74 \% are considered, yielding overlapping voids as in an open-cell
foam and hence a connected pore structure. The material is represented by a
network of beams. The elastic behaviour of each beam is derived analytically
from the material structure. By computing the linear elastic properties of the
beam network, the Young's moduli and Poisson ratios for different directions
are evaluated. In the limit of rigidity loss a power law is obtained,
describing the relation between Young's modulus and void fraction with an
exponent of 5/2 for bending-dominated and 3/2 for stretching-dominated
directions. The corresponding Poisson ratios vary between 0 and 1. With
decreasing void fraction, these exponents become 2.3 and 1.3, respectively. The
data obtained analytically and from the new beam model are compared to Finite
Element simulations carried out in a companion study, and good agreement is
found. The hexagonal close-packed void arrangement features very anisotropic
behaviour, comparable to that of fibre-reinforced materials, This might allow
for new applications of open-cell materials.

mixing built on orbitals of the sd-shell, and both the mixing coefficients of
the nuclear state and the single-particle wave functions are determined
consistently from the same variational principle. The calculations are done
using the D1S Gogny force. Various ground-state properties are analyzed. In
particular, the correlation content and composition of the wave function as
well as the single-particle orbitals and energies are examined. Binding
energies and charge radii are also calculated and compared to experiment. The
description of the first excited state is also examined and the corresponding
transition densities are used as input for the calculation of inelastic
electron and proton scattering. Special attention is paid to the effect of the
optimization of the single-particle states consistently with the correlations
of the system. Globally, the results are satisfying and encouraging. In
particular, charge radii and excitation energies are nicely reproduced.
However, the chosen valence-space truncation scheme precludes achieving maximum
collectivity in the studied nuclei. Further refinement of the method and a
better-suited interaction are necessary to remedy this situation.

Combined with linear phase modulation to translate Gor'kov potential at a

follow the moving Gor'kov potential maintaining force equilibrium between
Stokes' drag and the radiation force by W-SSAW. There exist two asymmetric
equilibrium positions every period, and by the asymmetry, each group of
particles is trapped at different equilibrium positions to form an alternate
pattern. This technique is extended to two-dimensional alternate patterning by
maintaining phase difference $90^\circ$ between X- and Y-directional W-SSAWs.
The patterning method utilizing W-SSAW is advantageous over SSAW-based

fourth order occurring in a periodic structure where four Bloch modes, two
propagating and two evanescent, coalesce. It leads to a very flat
wavenumber-frequency dispersion relation, and the finite length structure's
quality factor scales as $N^5$ where $N$ is the number of unit cells. The
proposed waveguide in which DBE is observed here is designed by periodically
loading a circular waveguide with misaligned elliptical metallic rings,
supported by a low-index dielectric. We validate the existence of the DBE in
such structure using measurements and we report good agreement between
full-wave simulation and the measured response of the waveguide near the DBE
frequency; taking into account metallic losses. We correlate our finding to
theoretical and simulation results utilizing various techniques including
dispersion synthesis, as well as observing how quality factor and group delay
scale as the structure length increases. Moreover, the reported geometry is
only an example of metallic waveguide with DBE: DBE and its characteristics can
also be designed in many other kinds of waveguides and various applications can
be contemplated as high microwave generation in amplifiers and oscillators

bearing promising potential for emerging electronic and optoelectronic device
technologies. The crystalline structure of BP displays in-plane anisotropy in
addition to the out-of-plane anisotropy characteristic to layered materials.
Therefore, BP supports anisotropic optical and transport responses that can
enable unique device architectures. Its thickness-dependent direct bandgap
varies in the range of around 0.3-2.0 eV (from single-layer to bulk,
respectively), making BP suitable to optoelectronics in a broad spectral range.
With high room-temperature mobility, exceeding 1,000 cm2V-1s-1 in thin films,
BP is also a very promising material for electronics. However, BP is sensitive
to oxygen and humidity due to its three-fold coordinated atoms. The surface
electron lone pairs are reactive and can lead to structural degradation upon
exposure to air, leading to significant device performance degradation in
ambient condition. Here, we report a viable solution to overcome degradation in
few-layer BP by passivating the surface with self-assembled monolayers of
octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) that provide long-term stability in ambient
conditions. Importantly, we show that this treatment does not cause any
undesired carrier doping of the bulk channel material, thanks to the emergent
hierarchical interface structure. Our approach is compatible with conventional
electronic materials processing technologies thus providing an immediate route
toward practical applications in BP devices.

also slowing down service innovation. Hence, network operators are starting to
deploy Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), which are virtualized over commodity
hardware. VNFs can be deployed in Data Centers (DCs) or in Network Function
Virtualization (NFV) capable network elements (nodes) such as routers and
switches. NFV capable nodes and DCs together form a Network enabled Cloud (NeC)

phylogenetic trees are estimated in an extremely high-dimensional space,
resulting in uncertainty information that cannot be discarded. Most
importantly, it is a method that allows biologists to diagnose whether
differences between gene trees are biologically meaningful, or due to
uncertainty in estimation.

the choice of a resummation scheme due to the slow convergence of QCD
perturbation theory at the $\tau$ mass, there is an ongoing controversy over
how to deal properly with non-perturbative effects. These are small, but not
negligible, and include quark-hadron ""duality violations"" (i.e., resonance
effects) which are not described by the operator product expansion (OPE). In
one approach, an attempt is made to suppress duality violations enough that
they might become negligible. The number of OPE parameters to be fit, however,
then exceeds the number of available sum rules, necessitating an uncontrolled
OPE truncation, in which a number of higher-dimension OPE contributions in
general present in QCD are set to zero by hand. In the second approach,
truncation of the OPE is avoided by construction, and duality violations are
taken into account explicitly, using a physically motivated model. In this
article, we provide a critical appraisal of a recent analysis employing the
first approach and demonstrate that it fails to properly account for
non-perturbative effects, making the resulting determination of the strong
coupling unreliable. The second approach, in contrast, passes all

establish a quadratic {\em statistical--computational tradeoff} for SQ

obtain tight sample complexity lower bounds for high-dimensional {\em testing}

distributions, we demonstrate the presence of a merger bow shock. We identify
the presence of two jumps in surface brightness and in density located at
$\sim$400 kpc and $\sim$800 kpc from the cluster's core. At the position of the
inner jump, we detect a factor of $2.3\pm 0.2$ density jump, while at the
location of the outer jump, we detect a density drop of a factor of $3.5 \pm
0.7$. Combining this with the temperature distribution within the cluster, we
establish that the pressure of the hot gas is continuous at the 400 kpc jump,
while there is a factor of $6.2 \pm 2.8$ pressure discontinuity at 800 kpc
jump. From the magnitude of the outer pressure discontinuity, using the
Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions, we determine that the sub-cluster is moving
at $M = 2.3\pm 0.5$, or approximately $2600\pm 565$ km/s through the
surrounding intracluster medium, creating the conditions for a bow shock. Based
on these findings, we conclude that the pressure discontinuity is likely the
result of an ongoing major merger between two massive clusters. Since few
observations of bow shocks in clusters have been made, this detection can
contribute to the study of the dynamics of cluster mergers, which offers
insight on how the most massive clusters may have formed.

more luminous than normal turnoff stars. They were originally singled out by
using B-V and U-B colour cuts. Early studies found that a larger fraction of
field BMP stars were binaries compared to normal halo stars. Thus, BMP stars
are ideal field blue straggler candidates for investigating internal stellar
evolution processes and binary interaction. In particular, the presence or
depletion in lithium in their spectra is a powerful indicator as to their
origin. They are either old, halo blue stragglers experiencing internal mixing
processes or mass transfer (Li-depletion), or intermediate-age, single stars of
possibly extragalactic origin (2.2dex halo plateau Li). However, we note that
internal mixing processes can lead to an increased level of Li. Hence, this
study combines photometry and spectroscopy to unveil the origin of various BMP
stars. We first show how to separate binaries from young blue stars using
photometry, metallicity, and lithium. Using a sample of 80 BMP stars (T>6300K),
we find that 97% of the BMP binaries have V-Ks_0 < 1.08$\pm0.03$, while BMP
stars that are not binaries lie above this cut in 2/3 of the cases. This cut
can help classify stars which lack radial velocities from follow-up
observations. We trace the origin of two BMP stars from the photometric sample
by conducting a full chemical analysis using new high-resolution and high SN
spectra. Based on their radial velocities, Li, alpha, and s- and r-process
abundances we show that BPS CS22874-042 is a single star
(A(Li)$=2.38\pm0.10$dex) while with A(Li)$=2.23\pm0.07$dex CD-48 2445 is a
binary, contrary to earlier findings. Our analysis emphasises that field blue
stragglers can be segregated from single metal-poor stars, using V-Ks colours
with a fraction of single stars polluting the binary sample, but not vice
versa.(Abridged)

power law spectra of the lateral tails, $\Gamma \approx 1$, are significantly
harder than those of the pulsar ($\Gamma \approx 1.5$) and the axial tail
($\Gamma \approx 1.6$). There is no significant diffuse X-ray emission between
the lateral tails -- the ratio of the X-ray surface brightness between the
south tail and this sky area is at least 12. The lateral tails apparently
connect directly to the pulsar and show indication of moving footpoints. The
axial tail comprises time-variable emission blobs. However, there is no
evidence for constant or decelerated outward motion of these blobs. Different
physical models are consistent with the observed morphology and spectra of the
Geminga PWN. In one scenario, the lateral tails could represent an azimuthally
asymmetric shell whose hard emission is caused by the Fermi acceleration
mechanism of colliding winds. In another scenario, the lateral tails could be
luminous, bent polar outflows, while the blobs in the axial tail could
represent a crushed torus. In a resemblance to planetary magnetotails, the
blobs of the axial tail might also represent short-lived plasmoids which are
formed by magnetic field reconnection in the relativistic plasma of the pulsar

STINGS here) by comparing particle tags with stars in a smooth particle
hydrodynamic (SPH) simulation. We focus on the spherically averaged density
profile of stars accreted from satellite galaxies in a Milky Way (MW)-like
system. The stellar profile in the SPH simulation can be recovered accurately
by tagging dark matter (DM) particles in the same simulation according to a
prescription based on the rank order of particle binding energy. Applying the
same prescription to an N-body version of this simulation produces a density
profile differing from that of the SPH simulation by <10 per cent on average
between 1 and 200 kpc. This confirms that particle tagging can provide a
faithful and robust approximation to a self-consistent hydrodynamical
simulation in this regime (in contradiction to previous claims in the
literature). We find only one systematic effect, likely due to the
collisionless approximation, namely that massive satellites in the SPH
simulation are disrupted somewhat earlier than their collisionless
counterparts. In most cases this makes remarkably little difference to the
spherically averaged distribution of their stellar debris. We conclude that,
for galaxy formation models that do not predict strong baryonic effects on the
present-day DM distribution of MW-like galaxies or their satellites,
differences in stellar halo predictions associated with the treatment of star
formation and feedback are much more important than those associated with the
dynamical limitations of collisionless particle tagging.

spectrum that is bounded from below. The complex theory can be canonically
quantised. The resulting quantum theory does not suffer from the kinetic
instability and maintains the usual probabilistic interpretation without
violating the correspondence principle. As a proof of concept, we construct a
class of stable interacting complex higher derivative theories. This consistent

to understand the would-be ghosts in any kinetically stable higher derivative

the same classification scheme than that adopted by the KMOS3D team. Because
merger orbital motions can also brought rotation, we have also analysed galaxy
morphologies from the available HST imagery. Combining these results to those
from kinematics, it leads to a full morpho-kinematic classification. To test
the robustness of the latter for disentangling isolated disks from mergers, we
confronted the results with an analysis of pairs from the open-grism redshift
survey 3D-HST. All galaxies found in pairs are affected by either kinematic
and/or morphological perturbations. Conversely, all galaxies classified as
virialized spirals are found to be isolated. A significant fraction (one
fourth) of rotating disks classified from kinematics by the KMOS3D team are
found in pairs, which further supports the need for a morpho-kinematic
classification. It results that only one third of z~1 galaxies are isolated and
virialized spirals, while 58% of them are likely involved in a merger sequence,
from first approach to disk rebuilding. The later fraction is in good agreement
with the results of semi-empirical {\Lambda}CDM models, supporting a

boundary Quantum Hall effect described by a Chern-Simons term at level
$\frac{m!}{2}$. We show that the factor of $m!$ can be understood by requiring
gauge invariance of the exponential of the Chern-Simons term on a general
Euclidean manifold, and we also use this argument to characterize the
electromagnetic and gravitational responses of fermionic SPT phases with $U(1)$
symmetry in all odd dimensions. We then use our gauged boundary actions for the

additional results. In particular, in Appendix A we use the connection between

for photons produced in the galaxy and then resonantly scattered by gas in an
outflowing envelope. The observed trends of LAH sizes with host galaxy
properties suggest that the physical conditions of the circumgalactic medium

filters, we select $>3000$ H$\alpha$ emitters within $19$ clusters and their
larger scale environment over a total volume of $1.3\times10^5$ Mpc$^3$. The
sample includes both relaxed and merging clusters, covering the $0.15-0.31$
redshift range and spanning from $5\times10^{14}$ $M_{\odot}$ to
$30\times10^{14}$ $M_{\odot}$. We find that the H$\alpha$ luminosity function
(LF) for merging clusters has a higher characteristic density $\phi^*$ compared
to relaxed clusters. $\phi^*$ drops from cluster core to cluster outskirts for
both merging and relaxed clusters, with the merging cluster values $\sim0.3$
dex higher at each projected radius. The characteristic luminosity $L^*$ drops
over the $0.5-2.0$ Mpc distance from the cluster centre for merging clusters
and increases for relaxed objects. Among disturbed objects, clusters hosting
large-scale shock waves (traced by radio relics) are overdense in H$\alpha$
emitters compared to those with turbulence in their intra-cluster medium
(traced by radio haloes). We speculate that the increase in star formation
activity in disturbed, young, massive galaxy clusters can be triggered by
interactions between gas-rich galaxies, shocks and/or the intra-cluster medium,
as well as accretion of filaments and galaxy groups. Our results indicate that
disturbed clusters represent vastly different environments for galaxy evolution
compared to relaxed clusters or average field environments.

stability in the prototype phase stable and separating materials LixCoO2 and
olivine LixFePO4, respectively. We exploit a new spectral decomposition of the
DFT+U total energy, revealing the distinct roles of the filling and ordering of
the d orbital correlated subspace. The on-site interaction U drives both of
these very different materials systems towards phase separation, stemming from
enhanced ordering of the d orbital occupancies in the x=0 and x=1 species,
whereas changes in the overall filling of the d shell contribute negligibly. We
show that DFT+U formation energies are qualitatively consistent with
experiments for phase stable LixCoO2, phase separating LixFePO4, and phase
stable LixCoPO4. However, we find that charge ordering plays a critical role in
the energetics at intermediate x, strongly dampening the tendency for the
Hubbard U to drive phase separation. Most relevantly, the phase stability of
Li1/2CoO2 within DFT+U is qualitatively incorrect without allowing charge
ordering, which is problematic given that neither charge ordering nor the band
gap that it induces are observed in experiment. We demonstrate that charge
ordering arises from the correlated subspace interaction energy as opposed to
the double counting. Additionally, we predict the Li order-disorder transition
temperature for Li1/2CoO2, demonstrating that the unphysical charge ordering
within DFT+U renders the method problematic, often producing unrealistically
large results. Our findings motivate the need for other advanced techniques,

lack of a variable charge interatomic potential model for tantalum oxides that

we introduce a charge transfer ionic potential (CTIP) model for Ta/Ta-oxide

Asteroid Thermal Model (NEATM) is used to fit signatures of thermal emission in
near-infrared (0.8 - 2.5 micron) spectral data. This analysis represents a
systematic study of thermal variability in the near-IR as a function of phase
angle. The observations of QE2 imply that carefully timed observations from
multiple viewing geometries can be used to constrain physical properties like
retrograde versus prograde pole orientation and thermal inertia. The FG3
results are more ambiguous with detected thermal variability possibly due to
systematic issues with NEATM, an unexpected prograde rotation state, or a
surface that is spectrally and thermally heterogenous. This study highlights
the potential diagnostic importance of high phase angle thermal measurements on
both sides of opposition. We find that the NEATM thermal beaming parameters
derived from our near-IR data tend to be of order 10's of percent higher than
parameters from ensemble analyses of longer wavelength data sets. However, a
systematic comparison of NEATM applied to data in different wavelength regimes
is needed to understand whether this offset is simply a reflection of small
number statistics or an intrinsic limitation of NEATM when applied to near-IR
data. With the small sample presented here, it remains unclear whether NEATM
modeling at near-IR wavelengths can robustly determine physical properties like
pole orientation and thermal inertia.

  In the non topological case, modeled by a square lattice with Rashba
interactions, we find that as soon as the normal quantum wires can host several
conduction channels, the spin degeneracy of Andreev levels is lifted by a phase
difference between the S reservoirs which breaks time reversal symmetry in zero
Zeeman field. The Andreev states remain degenerate at phases multiple of $\pi$
for which time reversal symmetry is preserved, giving rise to level crossings
which are not lifted by disorder. In contrast with the dc Josephson current,
the finite frequency admittance (susceptibility) is very sensitive to these
level crossings and the lifting of their degeneracy by a small Zeeman field.
More interesting is the case of the hexagonal lattice with next nearest
neighbor spin-orbit interactions which exhibit 1D topological helical edge
states \cite{Kane2005}. The finite frequency admittance carries then a very
specific signature at low temperature of a protected Andreev level crossing at

dynamical systems. The basic idea is to lift the nonlinear dynamics into a
higher dimensional space where its evolution is approximately linear. In an
uncontrolled setting, this procedure amounts to a numerical approximation of
the Koopman operator associated to the nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we
extend the Koopman operator to controlled dynamical systems and compute a
finite-dimensional approximation of the operator in such a way that this
approximation has the form a linear controlled dynamical system. In numerical
examples, the linear predictors obtained in this way exhibit a performance
superior to existing linear predictors such as those based on local
linearization or the so-called Carleman linearization. Importantly, the
procedure to construct these linear predictors is completely data-driven and
extremely simple -- it boils down to a nonlinear transformation of the data
(the lifting) and a linear least squares problem in the lifted space that can
be readily solved for large data sets. These linear predictors can be readily
used to design controllers for the nonlinear dynamical system using linear
controller design methodologies. We focus in particular on model predictive
control (MPC) and show that MPC controllers designed in this way enjoy
computational complexity of the underlying optimization problem comparable to
that of MPC for a linear dynamical system of the same size. Importantly, linear
inequality constraints on the state and control inputs as well as nonlinear
constraints on the state can be imposed in a linear fashion in the proposed MPC
scheme. Similarly, cost functions nonlinear in the state variable can be
handled in a linear fashion. Numerical examples (including a high-dimensional
nonlinear PDE control) demonstrate the approach with the source code available
online.

the problem of endogenous selections of sequential treatments. An IVR is a
sequence of instrumental variables in which each IV instruments for an
endogenous treatment variable. Our proposed method generalizes the LATE model
in Imbens and Angrist (1994) from a single treatment to many treatments applied
sequentially. More precisely, with the IVR this model allows for estimating the
local average treatment regime effects (LATRE), possibly conditional on a set
of initial covariates. Though there exist studies in this area that use IVR,
all of them require a structural functional form assumption. Our method is
novel in that we do not require any such assumption. Thus unlike previous
approaches, ours is robust to model misspecifications, which usually occur in
treatment regime settings. The ideas and estimators in this paper are motivated
and illustrated through a contextual example showing the use of IVR in
estimating the treatment regime effect of advertisements on purchasing
behaviors when advertisements are displayed in multiple periods. We demonstrate

fluid produces hydro- dynamic stresses that deform the wall, which, in turn,
results in a lift force on the object. Recent experiments with cylinders
sliding under gravity near a soft incline, which confirmed theoretical
arguments for the lift force, also reported an unexplained steady-state
rotation of the cylinders [Saintyves et al. PNAS 113(21), 2016]. Motivated by
these observations, we show, in the lubrication limit, that an infinite
cylinder that translates in a viscous fluid parallel to a soft wall at constant
speed and separation distance must also rotate in order to remain free of
torque. Using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem, we show analytically that for
small deformations of the elastic layer, the angular velocity of the cylinder
scales with the cube of the sliding speed. These predictions are confirmed
numerically. We then apply the theory to the gravity-driven motion of a
cylinder near a soft incline and find qualitative agreement with the
experimental observations, namely that a softer elastic layer results in a
greater angular speed of the cylinder.

makes them difficult to learn and limits their applicability. Sum-product
networks are a class of deep models where, surprisingly, inference remains
tractable even when an arbitrary number of hidden layers are present. In this
paper, we generalize this result to a much broader set of learning problems:
all those where inference consists of summing a function over a semiring. This
includes satisfiability, constraint satisfaction, optimization, integration,
and others. In any semiring, for summation to be tractable it suffices that the
factors of every product have disjoint scopes. This unifies and extends many
previous results in the literature. Enforcing this condition at learning time
thus ensures that the learned models are tractable. We illustrate the power and
generality of this approach by applying it to a new type of structured
prediction problem: learning a nonconvex function that can be globally
optimized in polynomial time. We show empirically that this greatly outperforms
the standard approach of learning without regard to the cost of optimization.

these nonlinearities were previously very weak in silicon photonic systems, the
recent emergence of new optomechanical waveguide structures have transformed
Brillouin processes into one of the strongest and most tailorable on-chip
nonlinear interactions. New technologies based on Brillouin couplings have
formed a basis for amplification, filtering, and nonreciprocal signal
processing techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate strong guided-wave
Brillouin scattering between light fields guided in distinct spatial modes of a
silicon waveguide for the first time. This inter-modal coupling creates
dispersive symmetry breaking between Stokes and anti-Stokes processes,
permitting single-sideband amplification and wave dynamics that permit
near-unity power conversion. Combining these physics with integrated
mode-multiplexers enables novel device topologies and eliminates the need for
optical circulators or narrowband spectral filtering to separate pump and
signal waves as in traditional Brillouin processes. We demonstrate 3.5 dB of
optical gain, over 2.3 dB of net amplification, and 50% single-sideband energy
transfer between two optical modes in a pure silicon waveguide, expanding the

for a total areal coverage of 104 square degrees. As such, the survey is well
suited for the study of galaxies' outskirts, haloes and low surface brightness
features that arise from dynamical interactions within the cluster environment.
We report the discovery of extremely faint ($\mu_g$ $>$ 25 mag arcsec$^{-2}$)
shells in three Virgo cluster early-type dwarf galaxies, VCC~1361, VCC~1447 and
VCC~1668. Among them, VCC~1447 has an absolute magnitude M$_{g}$ = -11.71 mag

We present a detailed study of these low surface brightness features. We detect
between three and four shells in each of our galaxies. Within the
uncertainties, we find no evidence of a color difference between the galaxy
main body and shell features. The observed arcs of the shells are located upto
several effective radii of the galaxies. We further explore the origin of these
low surface brightness features with the help of idealized numerical
simulations. We find that a near equal mass merger is best able to reproduce
the main properties of the shells, including their quite symmetric appearance
and their alignment along the major axis of the galaxy. The simulations provide
support for a formation scenario in which a recent merger, between two
near-equal mass, gas-free dwarf galaxies forms the observed shell systems.

algebra defined by Solomon. Descent algebras of symmetric groups have
properties that are not shared by other Coxeter groups. For instance, the
natural map from the descent algebra of a symmetric group to its character ring
is a surjection with kernel equal the Jacobson radical. Thus, the descent
algebra implicitly encodes information about the representations of the
symmetric group, and a complete set of primitive idempotents in the character
ring leads to a decomposition of the group algebra into a sum of right ideals
indexed by partitions. Stanley asked whether this decomposition of the regular
representation of a symmetric group could be realized as a sum of
representations induced from linear characters of centralizers. This question
was answered positively by Bergeron, Bergeron, and Garsia, using a connection
with the free Lie algebra on n letters, and independently by Douglass,
Pfeiffer, and Roehrle, who connected the decomposition with the configuration
space of n-tuples of distinct complex numbers. The Mantaci-Reutenauer algebra
of a hyperoctahedral group is a subalgebra of the group algebra that contains
the descent algebra. Bonnafe and Hohlweg showed that the natural map from the
Mantaci-Reutenauer algebra to the character ring is a surjection with kernel
equal the Jacobson radical. In 2008, Bonnafe asked whether the analog to
Stanley's question about the decomposition of the group algebra into a sum of
induced linear characters holds. In this paper, we give a positive answer to
Bonnafe's question by explicitly constructing the required linear characters.

luminous transient that appeared to be a SN but did not destroy the progenitor

first review the Korean records and show that a spatial coincidence between the
guest star and Cas A cannot be ruled out, as opposed to previous studies. Based
on modern astrophysical findings on core-collapse SN, we argue that Cas A could
have had an impostor and derive its anticipated properties. It turned out that
the Cas A SN impostor must have been bright ($M_V =-14.7 \pm 2.2$ mag) and an
amount of dust with visual extinction of $\ge 2.8\pm 2.2 $ mag should have
formed in the ejected envelope and/or in a strong wind afterwards. The mass
loss needs to have been spherically asymmetric in order to see the light echo
from the SN event but not the one from the impostor event.

to model the temporal tensor data. It leverages a time constraint to capture
the evolving properties of tensor data. Nowadays the exploding dataset demands
a large scale PTTF analysis, and a parallel solution is critical to accommodate
the trend. Whereas, the parallelization of PTTF still remains unexplored. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient Parallel Probabilistic Temporal
Tensor Factorization, referred to as P$^2$T$^2$F, to provide a scalable PTTF

factorizations by considering the probabilistic decomposition and the temporal

a large tensor into independent sub-tensors, the computation of which is
inherently parallel. We train P$^2$T$^2$F with an efficient algorithm of
stochastic Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, and show that the
convergence is guaranteed. Experiments on several real-word tensor datasets

developed and applied to the surface states of (110) tungsten thin films. The
model describes accurately the anisotropic Dirac cone-like dispersion and
Rashba-like spin polarization of the surface states, including the crucial
effect of the relaxation of the surface atomic layer of the tungsten towards
the bulk. It is shown that the surface relaxation affects the tungsten surface
states because it results in increased overlaps between atomic orbitals of the
surface atomic layer and nearby layers whereas electric fields that are due to
charge transfer between the tungsten and the vacuum near the surface or between
the bulk and surface layers do not significantly affect the Rashba-Dirac
surface states. It is found that hybridization with bulk modes has differing
strengths for thin film surface states belonging to the upper and lower
Rashba-Dirac cones and results in $reversal$ of the directions of travel of
spin $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ electrons in most of the upper Rashba-Dirac
cone relative to those expected from phenomenology. It is also shown that
intrasite (not intersite) matrix elements of the spin-orbit Hamiltonian are

spin polarization. This finding should be considered when modeling topological

We study the evolution of local regions with m coupled voids. At low
temperature, energetically accessible local particle configurations can be
organized into a random tree with nodes and edges denoting configurations and
micro-string propagations respectively. Such trees defined in the configuration
space naturally describe systems defined in two- or three-dimensional physical
space. A micro-string propagation initiated by a void can facilitate similar
motions by other voids via perturbing the random energy landscape, realizing
path interactions between voids or equivalently string interactions. We obtain
explicit expressions of the particle diffusion coefficient and a particle
return probability. Under our approximation, as temperature decreases, random
trees of energetically accessible configurations exhibit a sequence of
percolation transitions in the configuration space, with local regions
containing fewer coupled voids entering the non-percolating immobile phase
first. Dynamics is dominated by coupled voids of an optimal group size, which
increases as temperature decreases. Comparison with a distinguishable-particle

  Actions","25 pages, Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Automatic
  Control",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers two problems -- a dynamic team problem and a
decentralized control problem. The problems we consider do not belong to the
known classes of ""simpler"" dynamic team/decentralized control problems such as
partially nested or quadratically invariant problems. However, we show that our
problems admit simple solutions under an assumption referred to as the
substitutability assumption. Intuitively, substitutability in a team (resp.
decentralized control) problem means that the effects of one team member's
(resp. controller's) action on the cost function and the information (resp.
state dynamics) can be achieved by an action of another member (resp.
controller). For the non-partially-nested LQG dynamic team problem, it is shown
that under certain conditions linear strategies are optimal. For the
non-partially-nested decentralized LQG control problem, the state structure can
be exploited to obtain optimal control strategies with recursively update-able
sufficient statistics. These results suggest that substitutability can work as
a counterpart of the information structure requirements that enable
simplification of dynamic teams and decentralized control problems.

production of molecules. After evolving through the Asymptotic Giant Branch
(AGB), proto-planetary nebula (PPN), to planetary nebula (PN) phases, CEs
ultimately merge with the interstellar medium (ISM). The study of molecules in
PNe, therefore, is essential to understanding the transition from stellar to
interstellar materials. So far, over 20 molecular species have been discovered
in PNe. The molecular composition of PNe is rather different from those of AGB
and PPNe, suggesting that the molecules synthesized in PN progenitors have been
heavily processed by strong ultraviolet radiation from the central star.
Intriguingly, fullerenes and complex organic compounds having aromatic and
aliphatic structures can be rapidly formed and largely survive during the
PPN/PN evolution. The similar molecular compositions in PNe and diffuse clouds
as well as the detection of C$_{60}^+$ in the ISM reinforce the view that the
mass-loss from PNe can significantly enrich the ISM with molecular species,
some of which may be responsible for the diffuse interstellar bands. In this
contribution, I briefly summarize some recent observations of molecules in PNe,
with emphasis on their implications on circumstellar chemistry.

magnitude wider than that displayed by the eigenvalue spectrum of $S$. Since
the former reflects how strongly light can be absorbed or amplified and the
latter announces the spontaneous symmetry breaking of $S$, these contrasting
spectral signatures indicate that near perfect absorption and extremely strong
amplification can be achieved even in the $\cal PT$-symmetric phase of $S$,
which is known for and defined by its flux-conserving eigenstates. We also show
that these contrasting spectral signatures are accompanied by strikingly
different sensitivities to disorder and imperfection, suggesting that the
eigenvalue spectrum is potentially suitable for sensing and the singular value
spectrum for robust switching.

symmetry solution of Einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant
$\Lambda$. Based on this new metric, we compute entropy on all horizons and we
give the entropy bound of the black hole. Hawking temperatures are calculated
by considering a perturbation to entropy relations due to that the spacetime
described by this inertial coordinates is no longer a stationary spacetime in
which surface gravity related to Hawking temperature is defined well on killing
horizon. We also get the Smarr relations and the first law of thermodynamics.
We find that the Schwarzschild-Beltrami-de Sitter black hole seems to have
similar thermodynamical properties to Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole in the
comparison between their corresponding thermodynamical quantities, although the

associated with the study of entropy in physical systems to cognition, focusing
on creative cognition. It is proposed that minds modify their contents and
adapt to their environments to minimize psychological entropy:
arousal-provoking uncertainty, which can be experienced negatively as anxiety,
or positively as a wellspring for creativity (or both). Thus, intrinsically
motivated creativity begins with detection of high psychological entropy
material (e.g., a question or inconsistency), which provokes uncertainty and is
arousal-inducing. This material is recursively considering from new contexts
until it is sufficiently restructured that arousal dissipates and entropy
reaches an acceptable level. Restructuring involves neural synchrony and
dynamic binding, and may be facilitated by temporarily shifting to a more
associative mode of thought. The creative outcome may similarly induce
restructuring in others, and thereby contribute to the cultural evolution of
more nuanced understandings. Thus, the concept of entropy could play a unifying
role in cognitive science as a driver of thought and action, and in cultural
studies as the driver of the creative innovations that fuel cultural evolution.
The paper concludes with an invitation for cross-disciplinary exploration of
this potential new arena of entropy studies.

most fruitfully characterized in terms of, not the generation of a single
correct solution (as it is conventionally construed), but using concepts in
their most compact form by activating neural cell assemblies that respond to
their most typical properties. This allows them to be deployed in a
conventional manner such that effort is reserved for exploring causal
relationships. Conversely, it is argued that divergent thought is most
fruitfully characterized in terms of, not the generation of multiple solutions
(as it is conventionally construed), but using concepts in a form that is,
albeit expanded, constrained by the situation, by activating neural cell
assemblies that respond to context-specific atypical properties. This allows
them to be deployed in a manner that is conducive to exploring unconventional
yet potentially relevant associations, and unearthing potentially useful
relationships of correlation. Thus, divergent thought can involve as few as one
idea. This proposal is compatible with widespread beliefs that (1) most
creative tasks require not many solutions but one, yet entail both divergent
and convergent thinking, and (2) not all problems with multiple solutions
require creative thinking, and conversely, some problems with single solution
do require creative thought. The chapter discusses how the ability to shift

information about the physical variables which characterize these tracers.
However, if the physical variables of interest are correlated with one another,
then extracting this information is not as straightforward as one might naively
have thought. We show how to exploit these correlations so as to estimate
scale-independent bias factors of all orders in a model-independent way. We
also show that failure to account for this will lead to incorrect conclusions
about which variables matter and which do not. Morever, accounting for this
allows one to use the scale dependence of bias to constrain the physics of halo
formation; to date the argument has been phrased the other way around. We
illustrate by showing that the scale dependence of linear and nonlinear bias,
measured on nonlinear scales, can be used to provide consistent estimates of
how the critical density for halo formation depends on halo mass. Our methods
work even when the bias is nonlocal and stochastic, such as when, in addition
to the spherically averaged density field and its derivatives, the quadrupolar
shear field also matters for halo formation. In such models, the nonlocal bias
factors are closely related to the more familiar local nonlinear bias factors,
which are much easier to measure. Our analysis emphasizes the fact that biased
tracers are biased because they do not sample fields (density, velocity, shear,
etc.) at all positions in space in the same way that the dark matter does.

clustering has demonstrated the advantages of combining the excursion set
approach with peaks theory. We extend these ideas and introduce a model of
excursion set peaks that incorporates the role of initial tidal effects or
shear in determining the gravitational collapse of dark haloes. The model -- in
which the critical density threshold for collapse depends on the tidal
influences acting on protohaloes -- is well motivated from ellipsoidal collapse
arguments and is also simple enough to be analytically tractable. We show that
the predictions of this model are in very good agreement with measurements of
the halo mass function and traditional scale dependent halo bias in N-body
simulations across a wide range of masses and redshift. The presence of shear
in the collapse threshold means that halo bias is naturally predicted to be
nonlocal, and that protohalo densities at fixed mass are naturally predicted to
have Lognormal-like distributions. We present the first direct estimate of
Lagrangian nonlocal bias in N-body simulations, finding broad agreement with
the model prediction. Finally, the simplicity of the model (which has
essentially a single free parameter) opens the door to building efficient and
accurate non-universal fitting functions of halo abundances and bias for use in
precision cosmology.

of the microquasar GRS 1915+105 during the heartbeat state. The
phase-frequency-power maps show that the intermediate-frequency aperiodic X-ray
variability weakens as the source softens in the slow rise phase, and when the
quasi-periodic oscillation disappears in the rise phase of the pulse of the
double-peaked class its sub-harmonic is still present with a hard phase lag. In
the slow rise phase, the energy-frequency-power maps show that most of the
aperiodic variability is produced in the corona, and may also induce the
aperiodic variability observed at low energies from an accretion disk, which is
further supported by the soft phase lag especially in the
intermediate-frequency range (with a time delay up to 20 ms). In the rise phase
of the pulse, the low-frequency aperiodic variability is enhanced significantly
and there is a prominent hard lag (with a time delay up to 50 ms), indicating
that the variability is induced by extension of the disk toward small radii as
implied by the increase in flux and propagates into the corona. However, during
the hard pulse of the double-peaked class, the variability shows no significant
lag, which may be attributed to an optically thick corona. These timing results
are generally consistent with the spectral results presented by Neilsen et al.

Eddington limit and the rise phase of the pulse corresponds to a radiation

extended in two ways in order to allow a larger and more realistic class of CHR
programs to be considered confluent. Firstly, we introduce the relaxed notion
of confluence modulo equivalence into the context of CHR: while confluence for
a terminating program means that all alternative derivations for a query lead
to the exact same final state, confluence modulo equivalence only requires the
final states to be equivalent with respect to an equivalence relation tailored
for the given program. Secondly, we allow non-logical built-in predicates such
as var/1 and incomplete ones such as is/2, that are ignored in previous work on
confluence.
  To this end, a new operational semantics for CHR is developed which includes
such predicates. In addition, this semantics differs from earlier approaches by
its simplicity without loss of generality, and it may also be recommended for
future studies of CHR.
  For the purely logical subset of CHR, proofs can be expressed in first-order
logic, that we show is not sufficient in the present case. We have introduced a
formal meta-language that allows reasoning about abstract states and
derivations with meta-level restrictions that reflect the non-logical and
incomplete predicates. This language represents subproofs as diagrams, which
facilitates a systematic enumeration of proof cases, pointing forward to a
mechanical support for such proofs.

striking coronal activities in the form of a blowout jet which is associated
with rapid eruption of a cool flux rope. Further, the jet-associated flux rope
eruption underwent splitting and rotation during its outward expansion. These
coronal activities are followed by the prominence activation during which it
slowly rises with a speed of ~12 km/s while the region below the prominence
emits gradually varying EUV and thermal X-ray emissions. From these
observations, we propose that the prominence eruption is a complex, multi-step
phenomenon in which a combination of internal (tether-cutting reconnection) and
external (i.e., pre-eruption coronal activities) processes are involved. The
prominence underwent catastrophic loss of equilibrium with the onset of the
impulsive phase of an M1.8 flare suggesting large-scale energy release by
coronal magnetic reconnection. We obtained signatures of particle acceleration
in the form of power law spectra with hard electron spectral index (delta ~ 3)
and strong HXR footpoint sources. During the impulsive phase, a hot EUV
plasmoid was observed below the apex of the erupting prominence that ejected in
the direction of the prominence with a speed of ~177 km/s. The temporal,

  We propose a method to incrementally build ESDFs from Truncated Signed
Distance Fields (TSDFs), a common implicit surface representation used in
computer graphics and vision. TSDFs are fast to build and smooth out sensor
noise over many observations, and are designed to produce surface meshes.
Meshes allow human operators to get a better assessment of the robot's
environment, and set high-level mission goals.
  We show that we can build TSDFs faster than Octomaps, and that it is more
accurate to build ESDFs out of TSDFs than occupancy maps. Our complete system,
called voxblox, will be available as open source and runs in real-time on a
single CPU core. We validate our approach on-board an MAV, by using our system
with a trajectory optimization local planner, entirely on-board and in
real-time.

which individuals are represented as particles whose interactions are
determined by the current state of the system. Many animals, however, including
humans, have predictive capabilities, and presumably base their behavioural
decisions---at least partially---upon an anticipated state of their
environment. We explore a minimal version of this idea in the context of
particles that interact according to a pairwise potential. Anticipation enters
the picture by calculating the interparticle forces from linear extrapolations
of the particle positions some time $\tau$ into the future. Simulations show
that for intermediate values of $\tau$, compared to a transient time scale
defined by the potential and the initial conditions, the particles form
rotating clusters in which the particles are arranged in a hexagonal pattern.
Analysis of the system shows that anticipation induces energy dissipation and
we show that the kinetic energy asymptotically decays as $1/t$. Furthermore, we
show that the angular momentum is not necessarily conserved for $\tau >0$, and
that asymmetries in the initial condition therefore can cause rotational
movement. These results suggest that anticipation could play an important role
in collective behaviour, since it induces pattern formation and stabilises the
dynamics of the system.

degrees have asymptotically infinite variance. We assume that the empirical
degree distribution follows a power law with exponent $\tau\in (2,3)$, up to
value $n^{\beta_n}$ for some $\beta_n\gg (\log n)^{-\gamma}$ and
$\gamma\in(0,1)$. This assumption is satisfied for power law i.i.d. degrees,
and also includes truncated power-law distributions where the (possibly
exponential) truncation happens at $n^{\beta_n}$. We show that the graph
distance between two uniformly chosen vertices centers around $2 \log \log
(n^{\beta_n}) / |\log (\tau-2)| + 1/(\beta_n(3-\tau))$, with tight
fluctuations. Thus, the graph is an \emph{ultrasmall world} whenever
$1/\beta_n=o(\log\log n)$. We determine the distribution of the fluctuations
around this value, in particular we prove that these are non-converging tight
random variables that show $\log \log$-periodicity. We describe the topology
and number of shortest paths: We show that the number of shortest paths is of
order $n^{f_n\beta_n}$, where $f_n \in (0,1)$ is a random variable that
oscillates with $n$. The two end-segments of any shortest path have length
$\log \log (n^{\beta_n}) / |\log (\tau-2)|$+tight, and the total degree is
increasing towards the middle of the path on these segments. The connecting
middle segment has length $1/(\beta_n(3-\tau))$+tight, and it contains only
vertices with degree at least of order $n^{(1-f_n)\beta_n}$, thus all the
degrees on this segment are comparable to the maximal degree. Our theorems also
apply when instead of truncating the degrees, we start with a configuration
model and we remove every vertex with degree at least $n^{\beta_n}$, and the
edges attached to these vertices. This sheds light on the attack vulnerability
of the configuration model with infinite variance degrees.

in response to a related stimulus (prime). Experiments point to the existence
of an overlap between the populations of the neurons coding for different

long term memories correspond to stable steady states of a Hopfield network
with Hebbian connectivity. Experiments show that short term synaptic depression
plays an important role in the processing of memories. This leads naturally to
a computational model of priming, called latching dynamics; a stable state
(prime) can become unstable and the system may converge to another transiently
stable steady state (target). Hopfield network models of latching dynamics have
been studied by means of numerical simulation, however the conditions for the
existence of this dynamics have not been elucidated. In this work we use a
combination of analytic and numerical approaches to confirm that latching
dynamics can exist in the context of Hebbian learning, however lacks robustness

inverse time-harmonic acoustic wave scattering. The first one is concerned with
the recovery of the support of an inhomogeneous medium, independent of its
contents, by a single far-field measurement. For this challenging inverse
scattering problem, we establish a sharp stability estimate of logarithmic type
when the medium support is a polyhedral domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n=2,3$. The
second one is concerned with the stability for corner scattering. More
precisely if an inhomogeneous scatterer, whose support has a corner, is probed
by an incident plane-wave, we show that the energy of the scattered far-field
possesses a positive lower bound depending only on the geometry of the corner
and bounds on the refractive index of the medium there. This implies the
impossibility of approximate invisibility cloaking by a device containing a
corner and made of isotropic material. Our results sharply quantify the
qualitative corner scattering results in the literature, and the corresponding
proofs involve much more subtle analysis and technical arguments. As a
significant byproduct of this study, we establish a quantitative Rellich's
theorem that continues smallness of the wave field from the far-field up to the
interior of the inhomogeneity. The result is of significant mathematical
interest for its own sake and is surprisingly not yet known in the literature.

interacting with the SM Higgs doublet and having a negligible coupling to SM

a promising Dark Matter (DM) candidate. In order to check the consistency of
this scenario we evaluate the DM relic density and explore direct DM detection
and collider constraints on this model. It turns out that in the model when the
Higgs boson is only partly responsible for the generation of torsion mass,
there is a region of parameter space where torsion contributes 100% to the DM

circularised during a long period of accretion. The members of this new

which are not binary stars from the previous studies. We expected that these

superflare stars are expected to show strong X-ray luminosity. More than half
(37) of the 49 target stars show no evidence of binarity, and their atmospheric
parameters ($T_{\rm{eff}}$, $\log g$, and [Fe/H]) are within the range of
ordinary solar-analog stars. We measured Ca II 8542 and H$\alpha$ lines, which
are good indicators of the chromospheric activity. The intensity of these lines
indicates that all the target stars have large starspots. We also measured
$v\sin i$ (projected rotational velocity) and Lithium abundance for the target
stars. Li abundance is a key to understanding the evolution of the stellar
convection zone, which reflects the stellar age, mass and rotational history.
We confirmed that many of the target stars rapidly rotate and have high Li
abundance, compared with the Sun, as suggested by many previous studies. There
are, however, also some target stars that rotate slowly ($v\sin i$=2$\sim$3 km
s$^{-1}$) and have low Li abundance like the Sun. These results support that
old and slowly rotating stars similar to the Sun could have high activity level
and large starspots. This is consistent with the results of our previous
studies of solar-type superflare stars. In the future, it is important to
conduct long-term monitoring observations of these active solar-analog stars in
order to investigate detailed properties of large starspots from the viewpoint
of stellar dynamo theory.

to an unprecedented type of degrees of freedom coming from the restoration of
the gauge and diffeomorphism symmetry at the boundary. In the presence of a
loop quantum gravity state, these boundary degrees of freedom localize along a
set of punctures on the boundary sphere. We demonstrate that these degrees of
freedom are effectively described by auxiliary strings with a 3-dimensional
internal target space attached to each puncture. We show that the string
currents represent the local frame field, that the string angular momenta
represent the area flux and that the string stress tensor represents the two
dimensional metric on the boundary of the region of interest. Finally, we show
that the commutators of these broken diffeomorphisms charges of quantum
geometry satisfy at each puncture a Virasoro algebra with central charge $c=3$.
This leads to a description of the boundary degrees of freedom in terms of a
CFT structure with central charge proportional to the number of loop punctures.
The boundary $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry is recovered via the action of the $U(1)^3$
Kac-Moody generators (associated with the string current) in a way that is the
exact analog of an infinite dimensional generalization of the Schwinger

presented using deeply inelastic scattering data of various nuclear targets.
Two obtained data sets are provided for quark and gluon nuclear modification
factors, referred as nIMParton16. One is from the global fit only to the
experimental data of isospin-scalar nuclei (Set A), and the other is from the
fit to all the measured nuclear data (Set B). The scale-dependence is described
by DGLAP equations with nonlinear corrections in this work. The Fermi motion
and off-shell effect, nucleon swelling, and parton-parton recombination are
taken into account together for modeling the complicated $x$-dependence of
nuclear modification. The nuclear gluon shadowing in this paper is dynamically
generated by the QCD evolution of parton splitting and recombination processes
with zero gluon density at the input scale. Sophisticated nuclear dependence of
nuclear medium effects is studied with only two free parameters. With the
obtained free parameters from the global analysis, the nuclear modifications of
parton distribution functions of unmeasured nuclei can be predicted in our
model. Nuclear modification of deuteron is also predicted and shown with recent
measurement at JLab.

finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs the question remains open and we
conjecture that in this case the answer is positive. The conjecture is known to
hold for classes of graphs defined by a single forbidden induced subgraph $H$,
as such graphs are well-quasi-ordered and are of bounded clique-width if and
only if $H$ is an induced subgraph of $P_4$. For bigenic classes of graphs,

iterative algorithms have emerged as the standard approach to ill-posed inverse
problems in the past few decades. These methods produce excellent results, but
can be challenging to deploy in practice due to factors including the high
computational cost of the forward and adjoint operators and the difficulty of
hyper parameter selection. The starting point of our work is the observation
that unrolled iterative methods have the form of a CNN (filtering followed by
point-wise non-linearity) when the normal operator (H*H, the adjoint of H times
H) of the forward model is a convolution. Based on this observation, we propose
using direct inversion followed by a CNN to solve normal-convolutional inverse
problems. The direct inversion encapsulates the physical model of the system,
but leads to artifacts when the problem is ill-posed; the CNN combines
multiresolution decomposition and residual learning in order to learn to remove
these artifacts while preserving image structure. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed network in sparse-view reconstruction (down to 50
views) on parallel beam X-ray computed tomography in synthetic phantoms as well
as in real experimental sinograms. The proposed network outperforms total
variation-regularized iterative reconstruction for the more realistic phantoms

Galactic Center direction discovered almost a quarter of a century ago. The
system remains poorly studied in the optical domain due to its counterpart
being a very faint and absorbed target in a crowded region of the sky. Aims.
Our aim is to investigate GRS 1758-258 in order to shed light on the nature of
the stellar binary components. In particular, the main physical parameters of
the donor star, such as the mass or the spectral type, are not yet well
constrained. Methods. GRS 1758-258 has remained so far elusive to optical
spectroscopy owing to its observational difficulties. Here, we use this
traditional tool of stellar astronomy at low spectral resolution with a 10 m
class telescope and a long slit spectrograph. Results. An improved spectrum is
obtained as compared to previous work. The quality of the data does not allow
the detection of emission or absorption features but, nevertheless, we manage
to partially achieve our aims comparing the de-reddened continuum with the
spectral energy distribution expected from an irradiated disc model and
different donor star templates. Conclusions. We tentatively propose that GRS
1758-258 does not host a giant star companion. Instead, a main sequence star
with mid-A spectral type appears to better agree with our data. The main
impacts of this finding are the possibility that we are dealing with an
intermediate mass system and, in this case, the prediction of an orbital period
significantly shorter than previously proposed.

appearance of the KF in 1960s, it has been recognized that the factored-form of
the KF is preferable for practical implementation. The most popular and
beneficial techniques are found in the class of square-root algorithms based on
the Cholesky decomposition of error covariance matrix. Another important matrix
factorization method is the singular value decomposition (SVD) and, hence,
further encouraging implementations might be found under this approach. The
analysis presented here exposes that the previously proposed SVD-based KF

time-resolved neutron diffraction for about three days. Data show a continuous

the final material composed by crystalline domains plunged into a low-density,

$O(D,D)$ invariant formulation of the closed string theory when toroidally
compactified dimensions are present. The theory is based on a doubled spacetime
structure and, in order to preserve the gauge symmetry provided by the
invariance under generalized diffeomorphisms, a constraint has to be imposed on
fields and gauge parameters. In this paper, we propose a DFT-inspired
Supergravity by using a suitable {\em star product} that implements such
constraint and the corresponding algebraic structure is explored. We get a
consistent DFT in which also an orthogonality condition of momenta is necessary
for having a closed gauge algebra. In constructing this theory, we start from
the simplest case of doubling one spatial dimension where the action is
uniquely determined, without ambiguities, by the gauge symmetry. Then, the
extension to the generic $O(D, D)$ case is presented. The result is consistent
with the closed string field theory.

The main conclusion is that the LM method is more robust, while covariance

remarkable quantum phenomena. Owing to advances in laser technology, electric
fields comparable to those electrons experience in atoms are readily generated
and open opportunities to dynamically investigate the process of electron
tunneling through the potential barrier formed by the superposition of both
laser and atomic fields. Attosecond-time and angstrom-space resolution of the
strong laser-field technique allow to address fundamental questions related to
tunneling, which are still open and debated: Which time is spent under the
barrier and what momentum is picked up by the particle in the meantime? In this
combined experimental and theoretical study we demonstrate that for
strong-field ionization the leading quantum mechanical Wigner treatment for the
time resolved description of tunneling is valid. We achieve a high sensitivity
on the tunneling barrier and unambiguously isolate its effects by performing a
differential study of two systems with almost identical tunneling geometry.
Moreover, working with a low frequency laser, we essentially limit the
non-adiabaticity of the process as a major source of uncertainty. The agreement
between experiment and theory implies two substantial corrections with respect
to the widely employed quasiclassical treatment: In addition to a non-vanishing
longitudinal momentum along the laser field-direction we provide clear evidence
for a non-zero tunneling time delay. This addresses also the fundamental
question how the transition occurs from the tunnel barrier to free space
classical evolution of the ejected electron.

electric field. What will happen if strong interaction is introduced to this
system? Will the interaction wash out the characteristic features of Weyl
semimetals such as the Hall response? Is there a steady state and what is its
thermodynamic behavior? We answer these questions using AdS/CFT correspondence
in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric massless QCD in a rotating electric field
in the large $N_c$ limit realizing the first example of a ""holographic Floquet
state"". In this limit, gluons not only mediate interaction, but also act as an
energy reservoir and stabilize the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). We
obtain the electric current induced by a rotating electric field: In the high
frequency region, the Ohm's law is satisfied, while we recover the DC nonlinear
conductivity at low frequency, which was obtained holographically in a previous
work. The thermodynamic properties of the NESS, e.g., fluctuation-dissipation
relation, is characterized by the effective Hawking temperature that is defined
from the effective horizon giving a holographic meaning to the ""periodic
thermodynamic"" concept. In addition to the strong (pump) rotating electric
field, we apply an additional weak (probe) electric field in the spirit of the
pump-probe experiments done in condensed matter experiments. Weak DC and AC
probe analysis in the background rotating electric field shows Hall currents as
a linear response, therefore the Hall response of Floquet Weyl semimetals
survives at the strong coupling limit. We also find frequency mixed response
currents, i.e., a heterodyning effect, characteristic to periodically driven
Floquet systems.

numerical-relativity (NR) waveforms. The NR simulations expand the domain of
calibration towards larger mass ratios and spins, as compared to the previous
EOBNR model. Merger-ringdown waveforms computed in black-hole perturbation
theory for Kerr spins close to extremal provide additional inputs to the
calibration. For the inspiral-plunge phase, we use a Markov-chain Monte Carlo
algorithm to efficiently explore the calibration space. For the merger-ringdown
phase, we fit the NR signals with phenomenological formulae. After
extrapolation of the calibrated model to arbitrary mass ratios and spins, the
(dominant-mode) EOBNR waveforms have faithfulness --- at design Advanced-LIGO
sensitivity --- above $99\%$ against all the NR waveforms, including 16
additional waveforms used for validation, when maximizing only on initial phase
and time. This implies a negligible loss in event rate due to modeling for
these binary configurations. We find that future NR simulations at mass ratios
$\gtrsim 4$ and double spin $\gtrsim 0.8$ will be crucial to resolve
discrepancies between different ways of extrapolating waveform models. We also
find that some of the NR simulations that already exist in such region of
parameter space are too short to constrain the low-frequency portion of the
models. Finally, we build a reduced-order version of the EOBNR model to speed
up waveform generation by orders of magnitude, thus enabling intensive
data-analysis applications during the upcoming observation runs of Advanced
LIGO.

Navier-Stokes equation for a compressible fluid. The model is considered near
the special space dimension $d = 4$. It is shown that various correlation
functions of the scalar field exhibit anomalous scaling behaviour in the

related to fixed points of the renormalization group equations. In comparison

Constructive Mathematics and stated originally that ""if it is impossible that
an algorithm does not terminate, then it will terminate"". This principle has
been adapted to many different contexts, and in particular we are interested in
its most common version for arithmetic, which can be stated as ""given a total
recursive function f , if it is impossible that there is no n for which f(n) =
0, then there exists an n such that f(n) = 0"". This is in general not accepted
in constructivism, where stating an existential statement requires one to be
able to show at request a witness for the statement: here there is no clear way
to choose such an n. We introduce more in detail the context of constructive
mathematics from different points of view, and we show how they are related to
Markov's principle. In particular, several realizability semantics are
presented, which provide interpretations of logical systems by means of
different computational concepts (mainly, recursive functions and lambda
calculi). This field of research gave origin to the well known paradigm often
called Curry-Howrd isomorphism, or also propositions as types, that states a
correspondence between proofs in logic and programs in computer science. Thanks
to this the field of proof theory, that is the metamathematical investigations
of proofs as mathematical objects, became of interest for computer science and
in particular for the study of programming languages. By using modern research
on the Curry-Howard isomorphism, we will obtain a more refined interpretation
of Markov's principle. We will then use this results to investigate the logical
properties of systems related to the principle, and introduce a proof
transformation technique to interpret constructively some non-constructive

Among all the subtleties in using large scale structure observables to
constrain PNG, accounting for relativistic corrections to the clustering
statistics is particularly important for the upcoming galaxy surveys covering
progressively larger fraction of the sky. We focus on relativistic projection
effects due to the fact that we observe the galaxies through the light that
reaches the telescope on perturbed geodesics. These projection effects can give
rise to an effective $f_{\rm NL}$ that can be misinterpreted as the primordial
non-Gaussianity signal and hence is a systematic to be carefully computed and
accounted for in modelling of the bispectrum. We develop the technique to
properly account for relativistic effects in terms of purely observable
quantities, namely angles and redshifts. We give some examples by applying this
approach to a subset of the contributions to the tree-level bispectrum of the
observed galaxy number counts calculated within perturbation theory and
estimate the corresponding non-Gaussianity parameter, $f_{\rm NL}$, for the
local, equilateral and orthogonal shapes. For the local shape, we also compute
the local non-Gaussianity resulting from terms obtained using the consistency
relation for observed number counts. Our goal here is not to give a precise
estimate of $f_{\rm NL}$ for each shape but rather we aim to provide a scheme
to compute the non-Gaussian contamination due to relativistic projection
effects. For the terms considered in this work, we obtain contamination of
$f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} \sim {\mathcal O}(1)$.

central feature. As the power-budget of classical receiver chains is dominated
by the high-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), there is a growing
interest towards deploying receiver architectures with reduced-bit or even
1-bit ADCs. In this paper, we study waveform design, optimization and detection
aspects of multi-user massive MIMO downlink where user terminals adopt very
simple 1-bit ADCs with oversampling. In order to achieve spectral efficiency
higher than 1 bit/s/Hz per real-dimension, we propose a two-stage precoding,
namely a novel quantization precoder followed by maximum-ratio transmission
(MRT) or zero-forcing (ZF) type spatial channel precoder which jointly form the
multi-user-multiantenna transmit waveform. The quantization precoder outputs
are optimized, under appropriate transmitter and receiver filter bandwidth
constraints, to provide controlled inter-symbol-interference (ISI) enabling the
input symbols to be uniquely detected from 1-bit quantized observations with a
low-complexity symbol detector in the absence of noise. An additional
optimization constraint is also imposed in the quantization precoder design to
increase the robustness against noise and residual inter-user-interference
(IUI). The purpose of the spatial channel precoder, in turn, is to suppress the
IUI and provide high beamforming gains such that good symbol-error rates (SERs)
can be achieved in the presence of noise and interference. Extensive numerical
evaluations illustrate that the proposed spatio-temporal precoder based
multiantenna waveform design can facilitate good multi-user link performance,
despite the extremely simple 1-bit ADCs in the receivers, hence being one
possible enabling technology for the future low-complexity IoT networks.

additional extinction of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with broad absorption
lines (BALQSOs). In contrast to the normal, relatively flat, mean AGN
attenuation curve, BAL dust is well fit by a steeply rising, SMC-like curve. We
confirm the shape of the theoretical Weingartner & Draine SMC curve out to 700
\AA, but the drop in attenuation at still shorter wavelengths is less than
predicted. The identical attenuation curve for low-ionization BALQSOs (LoBALs)
does not support them being a ""break out"" phase in the life of AGNs. Although
attenuation in the optical due to BAL dust is low ($E(B-V) \sim 0.03 - 0.05$),
the attenuation rises to one magnitude in the EUV because of the steep
extinction curve. Here the dust optical depth is at the optimum value for
radiative acceleration of dusty gas. Because the spectral energy distribution
of AGNs peaks in the EUV where the optical depth is highest, the force on the
dust dominates the acceleration of BAL gas. For LoBALs we get a negative
attenuation curve in the optical. This is naturally explained if there is more
light scattered into our line of sight in LoBALs compared with non-BALQSOs. We
suggest that this and partial covering are causes when attenuation curves

polynomial-time preprocessing of NP-hard problems---plays a central role in
parameterized complexity and has triggered an extensive line of research. This
is in part due to a lower bounds framework that allows to exclude
polynomial-size kernels under the assumption of NP $\nsubseteq$ coNP$/$poly. In
this paper we consider a restricted yet natural variant of kernelization,
namely strict kernelization, where one is not allowed to increase the parameter
of the reduced instance (the kernel) by more than an additive constant.
  Building on earlier work of Chen, Flum, and M\""{u}ller [Theory Comput. Syst.
2011] and developing a general and remarkably simple framework, we show that a
variety of FPT problems does not admit strict polynomial kernels under the
weaker assumption of P $\neq$ NP. In particular, we show that various
(multicolored) graph problems and Turing machine computation problems do not
admit strict polynomial kernels unless P $=$ NP. To this end, a key concept we
use are diminishable problems; these are parameterized problems that allow to
decrease the parameter of the input instance by at least one in polynomial
time, thereby outputting an equivalent problem instance. Finally, we study a
relaxation of the notion of strict kernels and reveal its limitations.

their introduction in 2007. While traditional side-channel attacks, such as
power analysis attacks and electromagnetic analysis attacks, required physical
presence of the attacker as well as expensive equipment, an (unprivileged)
application is all it takes to exploit the leaking information on modern mobile

since their scientific investigations during the smart card era in the 1990s.
Our proposed classification system allows to analyze side-channel attacks
systematically, and facilitates the development of novel countermeasures.
Besides this new categorization system, the extensive survey of existing
attacks and attack strategies provides valuable insights into the evolving
field of side-channel attacks, especially when focusing on mobile devices. We

problem. Integrating statistical prior information about the shapes to be

segmentation algorithms optimize an energy functional and find a point estimate
for the object to be segmented. This does not provide a measure of the degree
of confidence in that result, neither does it provide a picture of other
probable solutions based on the data and the priors. With a statistical view,
addressing these issues would involve the problem of characterizing the
posterior densities of the shapes of the objects to be segmented. For such
characterization, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling-based
image segmentation algorithm that uses statistical shape priors. In addition to
better characterization of the statistical structure of the problem, such an
approach would also have the potential to address issues with getting stuck at
local optima, suffered by existing shape-based segmentation methods. Our
approach is able to characterize the posterior probability density in the space
of shapes through its samples, and to return multiple solutions, potentially
from different modes of a multimodal probability density, which would be
encountered, e.g., in segmenting objects from multiple shape classes. We
present promising results on a variety of data sets. We also provide an
extension for segmenting shapes of objects with parts that can go through
independent shape variations. This extension involves the use of local shape
priors on object parts and provides robustness to limitations in shape training
data size.

be an entanglement monotone, with the special property of automatic
normalization. Necessary and sufficient conditions are developed for
constructing maximally entangled states in every multipartite system such that
they are true-generalized X states (TGX) states, a generalization of the Bell
states, and are extended to general nonTGX states as well. These results are
then used to prove the existence of maximally entangled basis (MEB) sets in all
systems. A parameterization of general pure states of all ent values is given,
and proposed as a multipartite Schmidt decomposition. Finally, we develop an
ent vector and ent array to handle more general definitions of multipartite
entanglement, and the ent is extended to general mixed states, providing a
general multipartite entanglement measure.

tools for enabling biology scientists and researchers to explore human health
and diseases. However, due to the computation complexity of the MD algorithm,
it takes weeks or even months to simulate a comparatively simple biology entity
on conventional multicore processors. The critical path in molecular dynamics
simulations is the force calculation between particles inside the simulated
environment, which has abundant parallelism. Among various acceleration
platforms, FPGA is an attractive alternative because of its low power and high
energy efficiency. However, due to its high programming cost using RTL, none of
the mainstream MD software packages has yet adopted FPGA for acceleration.
  In this paper we revisit the FPGA acceleration of MD in high-level synthesis
(HLS) so as to provide affordable programming cost. Our experience with the MD
acceleration demonstrates that HLS optimizations such as loop pipelining,
module duplication and memory partitioning are essential to improve the
performance, achieving a speedup of 9.5X compared to a 12-core CPU. More
importantly, we observe that even the fully optimized HLS design can still be
2X slower than the reference RTL architecture due to the common dynamic
(conditional) data flow behavior that is not yet supported by current HLS
tools. To support such behavior, we further customize an array of processing
elements together with a data-driven streaming network through a common RTL
template, and fully automate the design flow. Our final experimental results
demonstrate a 19.4X performance speedup and 39X energy efficiency for the
widely used ApoA1 MD benchmark on the Convey HC1ex FPGA compared to a 12-core
Intel Xeon server.

critique throws light on the significance of quantum interference and quantum
phase shifts in any such classical correspondence. Detailed analysis shows that
Feynman arguments are untenable on physical grounds and the claim made in the
original AB paper that this effect had no classical analog seems valid. The
importance of nonintegrable phase factor distinct from the AB phase factor,
here termed as Fock-London-Weyl phase factor for the historical reasons, is
underlined in connection with the classical aspects/limits. A topological
approach incorporating the physical significance of the interaction field
momentum is proposed. A new idea emerges from this approach that attributes the
origin of the AB effect to the exchange of modular angular momentum.

When a query vector is given to the system, associative memories are polled to
identify which one contain the closest match. Then an exhaustive search is
conducted only on the part of vectors stored in the selected associative
memory. We study the effectiveness of the system when messages to store are

theoretic approaches is proposed. This data model integrates output from a
standard digital elevation models (DEM) derived stream catchment boundaries,
and vector representation of stream centerlines then applies them to three
novel algorithms. The first is called Modified Nested Set (MNS), which is a
depth first graph traversal algorithm that searches across stream reaches
(vertices) and stream junctions (edges) labeling vertices by their discovery
time, finish time, and distance from the root. The second is called Log Reduced
Graphs (LRG), which creates a set S of logarithmically reduced graphs from the
original data, to store the watershed boundaries. The final algorithm is called
Stitching Watershed, which provides a technique to merge watershed boundaries
across the set of graphs created in the LRG algorithm.
  This technique was applied to the ~ 30,600 km2 Delaware River Watershed and
compared to hypothetical data storage models in terms of prep-processing, data
storage, and query complexity costs. Results show that the proposed technique
provides significant benefits vs. the hypothetical methods with a 99-98%
reduction in prepossessing, 96-80% reduction in query complexity and a 76%
reduction in storage costs. The increasing availability of high resolution
elevation data within the United States and the internationally provides an
opportunity to extend these results to other watersheds through the world.

content varied from 0.14 to 0.28 in the m-plane series and 0.08 to 0.21 for the
a-plane series. The low temperature photoluminescence spectra from both sets of
samples are very broad with full width at half-maximum height increasing from
81 to 330 meV as the In fraction increases. Comparative photoluminescence
excitation spectroscopy indicates that the recombination mainly involves
strongly localised carriers. At a temperature of 10 K the degree of linear
polarisation of the a-plane samples is much smaller than of the m-plane
counterparts and also varies across the spectrum. From polarisation-resolved
photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy we measured the energy splitting
between the lowest valence sub-band states to lie in the range of 23-54 meV for
both a-and m-plane samples in which we could observe distinct exciton features
in the polarised photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. Thus, the thermal
occupation of a higher valence subband cannot be responsible for the reduction
of the degree of linear polarisation. Time-resolved spectroscopy indicates that
in a-plane samples there is an extra emission component which at least partly
responsible for the reduction in the degree of linear polarisation.

hinders innovation. Our focus is on tool readiness and pipelines availability.
Even though most tools are freely available, pipelines for data analysis are in
general barely described and their configuration is far from trivial, with many
parameters to be tuned.
  In this paper we discuss how to effectively build and use pipelines, relying
on state of the art computing technologies to execute them without users need
to configure, install and manage tools, servers and complex workflow management
systems. We perform an in depth comparative analysis of state of the art
frameworks and systems. The NGSPipes framework is proposed showing that we can

  The NGSPipes framework and underlying architecture provides a major step
towards open science and true collaboration in what concerns tools and

that it is possible to execute data analysis pipelines in a decentralized and
