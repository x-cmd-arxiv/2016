observed X-ray pulsations at a frequency of $\sim339.97$ Hz in three different
observations of the source performed with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR during the
source outburst. This newly discovered accreting millisecond pulsar is part of
an ultra-compact binary system characterised by an orbital period of $44.3$
minutes and a projected semi-major axis of $\sim17.6$ lt-ms. Based on the mass
function we estimate a minimum companion mass of 0.024 M$_{\odot}$, which
assumes a neutron star mass of 1.4 M$_{\odot}$ and a maximum inclination angle
of $75^{\circ}$ (derived from the lack of eclipses and dips in the light-curve
of the source). We find that the companion star's Roche-Lobe could either be
filled by a hot ($5\times 10^{6}$ K) pure helium white dwarf with a 0.028
M$_{\odot}$ mass (implying $i\simeq58^{\circ}$) or an old (>5 Gyr) brown dwarf
with metallicity abundances between solar/sub-solar and mass ranging in the
interval 0.065$-$0.085 M$_{\odot}$ (16 < $i$ < 21). During the outburst the
broad-band energy spectra are well described by a superposition of a weak
black-body component (kT$\sim$ 0.5 keV) and a hard cutoff power-law with photon
index $\Gamma \sim$ 1.7 and cut-off at a temperature kT$_e\sim$ 130 keV. Up to
the latest Swift-XRT observation performed on 2016 July 19 the source has been

has a significant detrimental impact on carrier life-time has drawn much
concern within the solar-Si community. The effect, known as the copper-related
light-induced degradation (Cu-LID) of Si solar cells, has been connected to the
release of Cu interstitials within the bulk [Solar Energy Materials & Solar
Cells, 147:115-126, 2016]. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive analysis
of the formation/dissociation process of the CuB pair in Si by means of
first-principles modelling, as well as the interaction of CuB defects with
photo-excited minority carriers. We confirm that the long-range interaction
between the Cu cation and the B anion has a Coulomb-like behaviour, in line
with the trapping-limited diffusivity of Cu observed by transient ion drift
measurements. On the other hand, the short-range interaction between the
d-electrons of Cu and the excess of negative charge on B produces a repulsive
effect, thereby decreasing the binding energy of the pair when compared to the
ideal point-charge Coulomb model. We also find that metastable CuB pairs
produce acceptor states just below the conduction band minimum, which arise
from the Cu level emptied by the B acceptor. Based on these results, we argue
that photo-generated minority carriers trapped by the metastable pairs can
switch off the Coulomb interaction that holds the pairs together, enhancing the
release of Cu interstitials, and acting as a catalyst for Cu-LID.

networks (CNNs) has attracted much recent interest in machine learning and
computer vision. However, it is still not well understood how to create a
biologically plausible network of brain-like, spiking neurons with multi-layer,
unsupervised learning. This paper explores a novel bio-inspired spiking CNN
that is trained in a greedy, layer-wise fashion. The proposed network consists
of a spiking convolutional-pooling layer followed by a feature discovery layer
extracting independent visual features. Kernels for the convolutional layer are
trained using local learning. The learning is implemented using a sparse,
spiking auto-encoder representing primary visual features. The feature
discovery layer extracts independent features by probabilistic, leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons that are sparsely active in response to
stimuli. The layer of the probabilistic, LIF neurons implicitly provides
lateral inhibitions to extract sparse and independent features. Experimental
results show that the convolutional layer is stack-admissible, enabling it to
support a multi-layer learning. The visual features obtained from the proposed
probabilistic LIF neurons in the feature discovery layer are utilized for
training a classifier. Classification results contribute to the independent and
informative visual features extracted in a hierarchy of convolutional and
feature discovery layers. The proposed model is evaluated on the MNIST digit
dataset using clean and noisy images. The recognition performance for clean
images is above 98%. The performance loss for recognizing the noisy images is
in the range 0.1% to 8.5% depending on noise types and densities. This level of
performance loss indicates that the network is robust to additive noise.

used in actomyosin gels that reconstitute cell contractility, fast forward
movement is restricted to a small region of phase space with low mechanical
load and high ATP concentration, which is also characterized by frequent
ensemble detachment. At high load, these ensembles are stalled or move
backwards, but forward motion can be restored by decreasing ATP concentration.
In contrast, small ensembles of nonmuscle myosin II isoforms, which are found
in the cytoskeleton of nonmuscle cells, are hardly affected by ATP
concentration due to the slow kinetics of the bound states. For all isoforms,
the thermodynamic efficiency of ensemble movement increases with decreasing ATP
concentration, but this effect is weaker for the nonmuscle myosin II isoforms.

focus on user-irrepressible (UI) protocol sequences that can guarantee a
positive individual throughput per sequence period with probability one for a
slot-synchronous channel, regardless of the delay offsets among the users. As
the sequence period has a fundamental impact on the worst-case channel access
delay, a common objective of designing UI sequences is to make the sequence
period as short as possible. Consider a communication channel that is shared by
$M$ active users, and assume that each protocol sequence has a constant Hamming
weight $w$. To attain a better delay performance than previously known UI
sequences, this paper presents a CRTm construction of UI sequences with
$w=M+1$, which is a variation of the previously known CRT construction. For all
non-prime $M\geq 8$, our construction produces the shortest known sequence
period and the shortest known worst-case delay of UI sequences. Numerical
results show that the new construction enjoys a better average delay
performance than the optimal random access scheme and other constructions with
the same sequence period, in a variety of traffic conditions. In addition, we
derive an asymptotic lower bound on the minimum sequence period for $w=M+1$ if
the sequence structure satisfies some technical conditions, called

lightcurves cover timescales up to 7 years and typically contain 10000-30000
datapoints. We quantify the variability as function of timescale using the
time-dependent standard deviation 'pooled sigma'. We find that the overwhelming
majority of CTTS has low-level variability with sigma<0.3mag dominated by
timescales of a few weeks, consistent with rotational modulation. Thus, for
most young stars monitoring over a month is sufficient to constrain the total
amount of variability over timescales up to a decade. The fraction of stars
with strong optical variability (sigma>0.3mag) is 21% in our sample and 21% in
an unbiased control sample. An even smaller fraction (13% in our sample, 6% in

function of timescale from weeks to months or years. The presence of long-term
variability correlates with the spectral slope at 3-5mu, which is an indicator
of inner disk geometry, and with the U-B band slope, which is an accretion
diagnostics. This shows that the long-term variations in CTTS are predominantly
driven by processes in the inner disk and in the accretion zone. Four of the
stars with long-term variations show periods of 20-60d, significantly longer
than the rotation periods and stable over months to years. One possible
explanation are cyclic changes in the interaction between the disk and the
stellar magnetic field.

phenomenology of supercooled liquids has remained elusive, despite decades of

temperature, a liquid sees a sharp rise in its viscosity over a narrow
temperature range, eventually becoming frozen on laboratory timescales.
Explaining this immense increase in viscosity is one of the principle goals of
condensed matter physicists. To that end, numerous theoretical frameworks have
been proposed which explain and reproduce the temperature dependence of the
viscosity of supercooled liquids. Each of these frameworks appears only
applicable to specific classes of glassformers and each possess a number of
variable parameters. Here we describe a classical framework for explaining the
dynamical behavior of supercooled liquids based on statistical mechanical
considerations, and possessing only a single variable parameter. This parameter
varies weakly from liquid to liquid. Furthermore, as predicted by this new
classical theory and its earlier quantum counterpart, we find with the aid of a
small dimensionless constant that varies in size from $\sim 0.05-0.12$, a
universal (16 decade) collapse of the viscosity data as a function of

communication between spatially distant neural processes. These inter-areal
functional interactions develop in the background of a complex network of
axonal connections linking cortical and sub-cortical neurons, termed the human
""structural connectome"". Theoretical considerations and experimental evidence
support the view that the human brain can be modeled as a system operating at a
critical point between ordered (sub-critical) and disordered (super-critical)
phases. Here, we explore the hypothesis that pathologies resulting from brain
injury of different etiology are related to the model of a critical brain. For
this purpose, we investigate how damage to the integrity of the structural
connectome impacts on the signatures of critical dynamics. Adopting a hybrid
modeling approach combining an empirical weighted network of human structural
connections with a conceptual model of critical dynamics, we show that lesions
located at highly transited connections progressively displace the model
towards the sub-critical regime. The topological properties of the nodes and
links are of less importance when considered independently of their weight in
the network. We observe that damage to midline hubs such as the middle and
posterior cingulate cortex is most crucial for the disruption of criticality in
the model. However, a similar effect can be achieved by targeting less
transited nodes and links whose connection weights add up to an equivalent
amount. This implies that brain pathology does not necessarily arise due to
insult targeted at well-connected areas and that inter- subject variability
could obscure lesions located at non-hub regions. Finally, we discuss the
predictions of our model in the context of clinical studies of traumatic brain
injury and neurodegenerative disorders.

universality classes for generic shapes with $\tilde{d}$ orientational degrees
of freedom: (i) $\nu=1/(1+\tilde{d}/2)$ when $r$ is a smooth function of the
orientations as for smooth convex shapes, e.g., ellipsoids; (ii)
$\nu=1/(1+\tilde{d})$ when $r$ contains singularities due to flat sides as for,
e.g., spherocylinders and polyhedra. The exact solution explains in particular
why many empirically observed scalings in $2d$ and $3d$ fall in between these
two limiting values.

hole at the center of their host galaxy can be ripped apart by tidal stresses.
Some of the resulting stellar debris becomes more tightly bound to the hole and
can potentially produce an observable flare called a tidal-disruption event
(TDE). We provide a self-consistent, unified treatment of TDEs by non-spinning
(Schwarzschild) black holes, investigating several effects of general
relativity including changes to the boundary in phase space that defines the
loss-cone orbits on which stars are tidally disrupted or captured. TDE rates
decrease rapidly at large black-hole masses due to direct stellar capture, but
this effect is slightly countered by the widening of the loss cone due to the
stronger tidal fields in general relativity. We provide a new mapping procedure
that translates between Newtonian gravity and general relativity, allowing us
to better compare predictions in both gravitational theories. Partial tidal
disruptions in relativity will strip more material from the star and produce
more tightly bound debris than in Newtonian gravity for a stellar orbit with
the same angular momentum. However, for deep encounters leading to full
disruption in both theories, the stronger tidal forces in relativity imply that
the star is disrupted further from the black hole and that the debris is
therefore less tightly bound, leading to a smaller peak fallback accretion
rate. We also examine the capture of tidal debris by the horizon and the
relativistic pericenter precession of tidal debris, finding that black holes of
$10^6$ solar masses and above generate tidal debris precessing by $10^\circ$ or
more per orbit.

the frequency selective mmWave channels and formulate the channel estimation
problem as a sparse recovery in both time and frequency domains. Then, we
propose explicit channel estimation techniques for purely time or frequency

segmentation of multiple globally optimal surfaces in volumetric datasets. The
method is widely used in numerous medical image segmentation applications.
However, nodes in the graph based optimal surface segmentation method typically
encode uniformly distributed orthogonal voxels of the volume. Thus the
segmentation cannot attain an accuracy greater than a single unit voxel, i.e.
the distance between two adjoining nodes in graph space. Segmentation accuracy
higher than a unit voxel is achievable by exploiting partial volume information
in the voxels which shall result in non-equidistant spacing between adjoining
graph nodes. This paper reports a generalized graph based multiple surface
segmentation method with convex priors which can optimally segment the target
surfaces in an irregularly sampled space. The proposed method allows
non-equidistant spacing between the adjoining graph nodes to achieve subvoxel
segmentation accuracy by utilizing the partial volume information in the
voxels. The partial volume information in the voxels is exploited by computing
a displacement field from the original volume data to identify the
subvoxel-accurate centers within each voxel resulting in non-equidistant
spacing between the adjoining graph nodes. The smoothness of each surface
modeled as a convex constraint governs the connectivity and regularity of the
surface. We employ an edge-based graph representation to incorporate the
necessary constraints and the globally optimal solution is obtained by
computing a minimum s-t cut. The proposed method was validated on 10
intravascular multi-frame ultrasound image datasets for subvoxel segmentation
accuracy. In all cases, the approach yielded highly accurate results. Our
approach can be readily extended to higher-dimensional segmentations.

of a general convex function $f(\mathbf{X})$ with the domain being positive
semi-definite matrices; (ii) the minimization of a general convex function
$f(\mathbf{X})$ regularized by the matrix nuclear norm $\|\mathbf{X}\|_*$ with
the domain being general matrices. Despite their optimal statistical
performance in the literature, these two optimization problems have a high
computational complexity even when solved using tailored fast convex solvers.
To develop faster and more scalable algorithms, we follow the proposal of Burer
and Monteiro to factor the low-rank variable $\mathbf{X} =
\mathbf{U}\mathbf{U}^\top $ (for semi-definite matrices) or
$\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{U}\mathbf{V}^\top $ (for general matrices) and also replace
the nuclear norm $\|\mathbf{X}\|_*$ with
$(\|\mathbf{U}\|_F^2+\|\mathbf{V}\|_F^2)/2$. In spite of the non-convexity of
the resulting factored formulations, we prove that each critical point either
corresponds to the global optimum of the original convex problems or is a
strict saddle where the Hessian matrix has a strictly negative eigenvalue. Such
a nice geometric structure of the factored formulations allows many local
search algorithms to find a global optimizer even with random initializations.

O/Ne/Na mantle -- can be formed if the carbon flame is quenched in a super-AGB
(SAGB) star or white dwarf merger remnant. We show that this segregated hybrid
structure becomes unstable to rapid mixing within 2,000 years of the onset of
WD cooling. Carbon burning includes a weak reaction that removes electrons,
resulting in a lower electron-to-baryon ratio ($Y_{\rm e}$) in the regions
processed by carbon burning compared to the unburned C/O core, making the O/Ne
mantle denser than the C/O core as the WD cools. This is unstable to efficient
mixing. We use the results of $\texttt{MESA}$ models with different size C/O
cores to quantify the rate at which the cores mix with the mantle as they cool.
In all cases, we find that the WDs undergo significant core/mantle mixing on
timescales shorter than the time available to grow the WD to the Chandrasekhar
mass ($M_{\rm Ch}$) by accretion. As a result, hybrid WDs that reach $M_{\rm
Ch}$ due to later accretion will have lower central carbon fractions than
assumed thus far. We briefly discuss the implications of these results for the
possibility of Type Ia supernovae from hybrid WDs.

scope or difficulty of the learning problem over time, increasingly complex
learning problems can be addressed. We study incremental learning in the
context of sequence learning, using generative RNNs in the form of multi-layer
recurrent Mixture Density Networks. While the potential of incremental or
curriculum learning to enhance learning is known, indiscriminate application of
the principle does not necessarily lead to improvement, and it is essential
therefore to know which forms of incremental or curriculum learning have a
positive effect. This research contributes to that aim by comparing three
instantiations of incremental or curriculum learning.
  We introduce Incremental Sequence Learning, a simple incremental approach to
sequence learning. Incremental Sequence Learning starts out by using only the
first few steps of each sequence as training data. Each time a performance
criterion has been reached, the length of the parts of the sequences used for
training is increased.
  We introduce and make available a novel sequence learning task and data set:
predicting and classifying MNIST pen stroke sequences. We find that Incremental
Sequence Learning greatly speeds up sequence learning and reaches the best test
performance level of regular sequence learning 20 times faster, reduces the
test error by 74%, and in general performs more robustly; it displays lower
variance and achieves sustained progress after all three comparison methods
have stopped improving. The other instantiations of curriculum learning do not
result in any noticeable improvement. A trained sequence prediction model is
also used in transfer learning to the task of sequence classification, where it
is found that transfer learning realizes improved classification performance
compared to methods that learn to classify from scratch.

Reed-Solomon codes is a fundamental open problem in coding theory, explicitly
asked by Guruswami and Vardy (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2005). The problem is
motivated by the large current gap between the regime when it is NP-hard, and
the regime when it is efficiently solvable (i.e., the Johnson radius).
  We show the first NP-hardness results for asymptotically smaller decoding
radii than the maximum likelihood decoding radius of Guruswami and Vardy.
Specifically, for Reed-Solomon codes of length $N$ and dimension $K=O(N)$, we
show that it is NP-hard to decode more than $ N-K- c\frac{\log N}{\log\log N}$
errors (with $c>0$ an absolute constant). Moreover, we show that the problem is
NP-hard under quasipolynomial-time reductions for an error amount $> N-K-
c\log{N}$ (with $c>0$ an absolute constant).
  These results follow from the NP-hardness of a generalization of the
classical Subset Sum problem to higher moments, called {\em Moments Subset
Sum}, which has been a known open problem, and which may be of independent
interest.
  We further reveal a strong connection with the well-studied
Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem in Number Theory, which turns out to capture a
main barrier in extending our techniques. We believe the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott
problem deserves further study in the theoretical computer science community.

an upward shift in the spectrum, resulting in a more realistic picture. The
resulting GSWS potential does not merely accommodate extra quasi bound states,
but also has modified bound state spectrum. As an application, we apply the
formalism to a real problem, an $\alpha$ particle confined in Bohrium-$270$
nucleus. The thermodynamic functions Helmholtz energy, entropy, internal
energy, specific heat of the system are calculated and compared for both wells.
The internal energy and the specific heat capacity increase as a result of
upward shift in the spectrum. The shift of the Helmholtz free energy is a
direct consequence of the shift of the spectrum. The entropy decreases because
of a decrement in the number of available states.

We re-calibrate the $r$-band light curves for $\sim$28,000 luminous, broad-line
AGNs from the SDSS, producing a total of $\sim$2.4 million photometric data
points. We utilize both the structure function (SF) and power spectrum density
(PSD) formalisms to search for links between the optical variability and the
physical parameters of the accreting supermassive black holes that power the
quasars. The excess variance (SF$^{2}$) of the quasar sample tends to zero at
very short time separations, validating our re-calibration of the time-series
data. We find that the the amplitude of variability at a given time-interval,
or equivalently the time-scale of variability to reach a certain amplitude, is
most strongly correlated with luminosity with weak or no dependence on black
hole mass and redshift. For a variability level of SF($\tau$)=0.07 mag, the
time-scale has a dependency of $\tau \propto L^{0.4}$. This is broadly
consistent with the expectation from a simple Keplerian accretion disk model,
which provides $\tau \propto L^{0.5}$. The PSD analysis also reveals that many
quasar light curves are steeper than a damped random walk. We find a
correlation between the steepness of the PSD slopes, specifically the fraction
of slopes steeper than 2.5, and black hole mass, although we cannot exclude the
possibility that luminosity or Eddington ratio are the drivers of this effect.
This effect is also seen in the SF analysis of the (i)PTF data, and in a PSD
analysis of quasars in the SDSS Stripe 82.

constraints on planetary formation and migration. Studies have shown that giant
planets that migrate through the protoplanetary disk can accrete substantial
amounts of oxygen-rich planetesimals, leading to super-solar metallicities in
the envelope and solar or sub-solar C/O ratios. Pebble accretion has been
demonstrated to play an important role in core accretion and to have growth
rates that are consistent with planetary migration. The high pebble accretion
rates allow planetary cores to start their growth beyond 10 AU and subsequently
migrate to cold (>~ 1 AU), warm (~0.1 AU- 1AU) or hot (<~ 0.1 AU) orbits. In
this work we investigate how the formation of giant planets via pebble
accretion influences their atmospheric chemical compositions. We find that
under the standard pebble accretion scenario, where the core is isolated from
the envelope, the resulting metallicities (O/H and C/H ratios) are sub-solar,
while the C/O ratios are super-solar. Planets that migrate through the disk to
become hot Jupiters accrete substantial amounts of water vapour, but still
acquire slightly sub-solar O/H and super-solar C/O of 0.7-0.8. The metallicity
can be substantially sub-solar (~0.2-0.5x solar) and the C/O can even approach
1.0 if the planet accretes its envelope mostly beyond the CO2 ice line, i.e.
cold Jupiters or hot Jupiters that form far out and migrate in by scattering.
Allowing for core erosion yields significantly super-solar metallicities and
solar or sub-solar C/O, which can also be achieved by other means, e.g.
photo-evaporation and late-stage planetesimal accretion.

identified using ALMA 870$\mu$m continuum imaging in a pilot program to
precisely locate bright SCUBA2-selected sub-mm sources in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep
Survey (UDS) field. Using the available deep (especially near-infrared),
panoramic imaging of the UDS field at optical-to-radio wavelengths we
characterize key properties of the SMG population. The median photometric
redshift of the bright ALMA/SCUBA-2 UDS (AS2UDS) SMGs that are detected in a
sufficient number of wavebands to derive a robust photometric redshift is
$z$=2.65$\pm$0.13. However, similar to previous studies, 27% of the SMGs are
too faint at optical-to-near-infrared wavelengths to derive a reliable
photometric redshift. Assuming that these SMGs lie at z$\gtrsim$3 raises the
median redshift of the full sample to $z$=2.9$\pm$0.2. A subset of 23,
unlensed, bright AS2UDS SMGs have sizes measured from resolved imaging of their
rest-frame far-infrared emission. We show that the extent and luminosity of the
far-infrared emission are consistent with the dust emission arising from
regions that are optically thick, on average, at a wavelength of
$\lambda_0$$\ge$75$\mu$m (1-$\sigma$ dispersion of 55-90$\mu$m). Using the dust
masses derived from our optically-thick spectral energy distribution models we
determine that these galaxies have a median hydrogen column density of
$N_{H}$=9.8$_{-0.7}^{+1.4}$$\times$10$^{23}$cm$^{-2}$, or a corresponding

linear light scattering phase function (beta ~ 0.04) or an asteroid-like
HG-type phase function (G ~ 0.15). The radial brightness profile indicates a
'quasi-steady-state' dust coma from late September to the end of 2015. Dust
fragmentation during about a month after perihelion may be responsible for
radial coma profiles with slopes below unity, while dust accumulation due to
very slow dust expansion velocity may result in steeper than unity profiles
during 2016. Three fan-shape dust structures are characterized in the coma of
67P. A short dust ejection event on 22 -23 August 2015 has produced a dust
arc-let and jet feature in the coma. In September 2015 the appearance of

systematic measurement uncertainties will be crucial for the next generation of
cosmological surveys. We present a new analysis method, superABC, for obtaining
cosmological constraints from Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves using
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) without any likelihood assumptions. The
ABC method works by using a forward model simulation of the data where
systematic uncertainties can be simulated and marginalized over. A key feature
of the method presented here is the use of two distinct metrics, the `Tripp'
and `Light Curve' metrics, which allow us to compare the simulated data to the
observed data set. The Tripp metric takes as input the parameters of models fit
to each light curve with the SALT-II method, whereas the Light Curve metric
uses the measured fluxes directly without model fitting. We apply the superABC
sampler to a simulated data set of $\sim$1000 SNe corresponding to the first
season of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program. Varying $\Omega_m, w_0,
\alpha$ and $\beta$ and a magnitude offset parameter, with no systematics we
obtain $\Delta(w_0) = w_0^{\rm true} - w_0^{\rm best \, fit} = -0.036\pm0.109$
(a $\sim11$% 1$\sigma$ uncertainty) using the Tripp metric and $\Delta(w_0) =
-0.055\pm0.068$ (a $\sim7$% 1$\sigma$ uncertainty) using the Light Curve
metric. Including 1% calibration uncertainties in four passbands, adding 4 more
parameters, we obtain $\Delta(w_0) = -0.062\pm0.132$ (a $\sim14$% 1$\sigma$
uncertainty) using the Tripp metric. Overall we find a $17$% increase in the
uncertainty on $w_0$ with systematics compared to without. We contrast this
with a MCMC approach where systematic effects are approximately included. We
find that the MCMC method slightly underestimates the impact of calibration
uncertainties for this simulated data set.

strongly interacting few-body systems have received a lot of interest. These
two topics have been largely developed separately. However, the generality of
the latter as far as external potentials are concerned -- including random and
quasirandom potentials -- and their shared spatial dimensionality, makes it an
interesting way of dealing with MBL in the strongly interacting regime.
Utilising tools developed for few-body systems we look to gain insight into the
localization properties of the spin in a Fermi gas with strong interactions. We
observe a delocalized--localized transition over a range of fillings of a
quasirandom lattice. We find this transition to be of a different nature for
low and high fillings, due to the diluteness of the system for low fillings.

excellent tool for the study of electron-electron interactions. In actual
experiments, the layers display spatial charge density fluctuations due to
imperfections such as external charged impurities. However, at present a
systematic way of taking these inhomogeneities into account in drag
calculations has been lacking, making the interpretation of experimental data
problematic. On the other hand, there exists a highly successful and widely
accepted formalism describing transport within single inhomogeneous layers
known as effective medium theory. In this work, we generalize the standard
effective medium theory to the case of Coulomb drag between two inhomogeneous
sheets and demonstrate that inhomogeneity in the layers has a strong impact on
drag transport. In the case of exciton condensation between the layers, we show
that drag resistivity takes on a value determined by the amplitude of density
fluctuation. Next we consider drag between graphene sheets, in which the
existence of spatial charge density fluctuations is well-known. We show that
these inhomogeneities play a crucial role in explaining existing experimental
data. In particular, the temperature dependence of the experimentally observed
peaks in drag resistivity can only be explained by taking the layer density
fluctuations into account. We also propose a method of extracting information
on the correlations between the inhomogeneities of the layers. The effective
medium theory of Coulomb drag derived here is general and applies to all
two-dimensional materials.

magnetars satisfying $B/P > 2 \times 10^{16}$~G~s$^{-1}$ (1~G =

$\bE_\parallel$ of the surface electric field (under the scenario of a vacuum
magnetosphere) of such pulsars approaches 5 \% of the critical field $E_c =
m_e^2 c^3/(e\hbar)$, in strength, the field can readily decay via the Schwinger
mechanism into electron-positron pairs, the back reaction of which causes
$\bE_\parallel$ to oscillate on a characteristic timescale smaller than the
development of a spark gap. Thus, under this scenario, the open field line
region of the pulsar magnetosphere is controlled by Schwinger pairs, and their
large creation and acceleration rates enable the escaping pairs to coherently
emit radio waves directly from the polar cap. The majority of the energy is
emitted at frequencies $\lesssim 1$~GHz where the coherent radiation has the
highest yield, at a rate large enough to cause the magnetar to lose spin
significantly over timescale $\ap$ a few $\times 10^{-3}$~s, the duration of a
fast radio burst. Owing to circumstellar environment of a young magnetar,
however, the $\lesssim 1$~GHz radiation is likely to be absorbed or reflected
by the overlying matter. It is shown that the brightness of the remaining
(observable) frequencies of $\ap 1$~GHz and above are on par with a typical
fast radio burst. Unless some spin-up mechanism is available to recover the
original high rotation rate that triggered the Schwinger mechanism, the fast
radio burst will not be repeated again in the same magnetar.

Pan-STARRS1 (e.g. Kaiser et al. 2002, Kaiser 2004, Hodapp et al. 2004). The NEO

al. (2012) NEO orbit distribution. The debiased Pan-STARRS1 NEO absolute
magnitude distribution is more complex than a single slope power law - it shows
two transitions - at H$\sim$16 from steep to shallow slope, and in the
$21<H<23$ interval from a shallow to steep slope, which is consistent with
other recent works (e.g. Mainzer et al. 2011c, Brown et al. 2013, Harris and
D`Abramo 2015). We fit $\alpha = 0.48\pm0.02$ for NEOs with $13<H<16$, $\alpha
= 0.33\pm0.01$ for NEOs with $16<H<22$, and $\alpha = 0.62\pm0.03$ for the
smaller objects with $H>22$. There is also another change in slope from steep
to shallow around H=27. The three ARM target candidates detected by Pan-STARRS1
in one year of surveying have a corrected SFD with slope $\alpha =
0.40^{+0.33}_{-0.45}$.
  We also show that the window for follow up observations of small
(H$\gtrsim$22) NEOs with the NASA IRTF telescope and Arecibo and Goldstone
radars are extremely short - on order of days, and procedures for fast response
must be implemented in order to measure physical characteristics of small
Earth-approaching objects. CFHT's MegaCam and Pan-STARRS1 have longer observing
windows and are capable of following-up more NEOs due to their deeper limiting

minutes until the network converges and BGP routing becomes stable again.
Kotronis et al propose a novel Internet routing approach based on SDN
principles that combines several Autonomous Systems (AS) into groups, called
clusters, and introduces a logically centralized routing decision process for
the cluster participants. One of the goals of this concept is to stabilize the
IDR system and bring down its convergence time. However, testing whether such
approaches can improve on BGP problems requires hybrid SDN and BGP
experimentation tools that can emulate multiple ASes. Presently, there is a
lack of an easy to use public tool for this purpose. This work fills this gap

evaluated in high accuracy. I have analyzed the possible singularities in the
integral of scattering angle. There are possible singularities in the case of
attractive potential. This may result in problem for numerical integral. In
order to avoid the problem, I have used a proper scheme, e.g., splitting into
many subintervals and the width of each subinterval is determined by the
variation of the integrand, to calculate the scattering angle. The collision
integrals are calculated by using Romberg's method therefore the accuracy is
high (i.e., $ \sim 10^{-12}$). The results of collision integrals and their
derivatives in $-12 \leq \psi \leq 5$ are listed. By using Hermite polynomial
interpolation from those data, the collision integrals can be obtained with an
accuracy of $10^{-10}$. For very weak coupled plasma ($\psi \geq 4.5$),
analytical fittings for collision integrals are available with an accuracy of
$10^{-11}$. I have compared the final results of resistance coefficients with
other works and found that, for repulsive potential, the results are basically
same to others, for attractive potential, the results in intermediate and
strong coupled case show significant differences. The resulting resistance
coefficients are tested in the solar model. Comparing with the widely used Cox
et al.(1989) and Thoul et al. (1994) models, the resistance coefficients in
screen Coulomb potential leads to a little weaker effect in solar model, which
is contrary to the expectation of attempts to solve the solar abundance

layer-by-layer, and step flow growth modes as a function of temperature and
growth rate. Two models for surface diffusion are used, which produce different
effective Ehrlich-Schwoebel step-edge barriers, and different adatom diffusion
anisotropies on m-plane surfaces. Simulation results in agreement with observed

that anisotropy of step edge energy, rather than adatom diffusion, is

arbitrarily-complex, quantum systems, mutually noninteracting but coupled as

can be all the same or belong to different species, distinguishable or
indistinguishable, located at fixed positions or having translational degrees
of freedom. Even if the energy spectra of the constituent systems are
nondegenerate, as we suppose, the ensemble unavoidably presents degeneracies of
the energy levels and/or of the energy gaps. We show that, due to these
degeneracies, a thermalization analysis performed by the popular quantum
optical master equation reveals a number of serious pathologies, possibly
including a lack of ergodicity. On the other hand, a consistent thermalization
scenario is obtained by introducing a Lindblad-based approach, in which the
Lindblad operators, instead of being derived from a microscopic calculation,
are established as the elements of an operatorial basis with squared amplitudes
fixed by imposing a detailed balance condition and requiring their
correspondence with the dipole transition rates evaluated under the first-order
perturbation theory. Due to the above-mentioned degeneracies, this procedure
suffers a basis arbitrariness which, however, can be removed by exploiting the
fact that the thermalization of an ensemble of noninteracting systems cannot
depend on the ensemble size. As a result, we provide a clear-cut partitioning
of the thermalization time into dissipation and decoherence times, for which we
derive formulas giving the dependence on the energy levels of the elementary

originate beyond the snowline and then move inward via disk migration, or form
""in-situ"" inside the snowline. The goal of this work is to verify which of
these two scenarios is more compatible with pebble accretion, and whether we
can distinguish observationally between them via the resulting planetary C/O
ratios and core masses. Our results show that, for solar system composition,
the C/O ratios will vary but moderately between the two populations, since a
significant amount of carbon and oxygen are locked up in refractories. In this
case, we find a strong correlation between the carbon and oxygen abundances and
core mass. The C/O ratio variations are more pronounced in the case where we
assume that all carbon and oxygen are in volatiles. On average, Hot-Jupiters
forming ""in-situ"" inside the snowline will have higher C/O ratios because they
accrete less water ice. However, only Hot-Jupiters forming in-situ around stars
with C/O=0.8 can have a C/O ratio higher than unity. We finally find that, even
with fast pebble accretion, it is significantly easier to form Hot-Jupiters

Colloidal suspensions exhibit a wide range of rheological behavior, which
should be closely related to the microscopic structure of the systems. With
in-situ small-angle neutron scattering complemented by rheological
measurements, we investigated the deformation behavior of a charge-stabilized
colloidal glass at particle level undergoing steady shear. A short-lived,
localized elastic response at particle level, termed as transient elasticity
zone (TEZ), was identified from the neutron spectra. The existence of the TEZ
is a signature of the dynamical heterogeneity: The body of fluids under shear
behaves like an elastic solid within the spatial range of TEZ but like fluid
outside the TEZ. The size of TEZ shrinks as the shear rate increases in the
shear thinning region, which shows that the shear thinning is accompanied by a
diminishing dynamical heterogeneity. More interestingly, the TEZ is found to be
the structural unit that provides the resistance to the imposed shear, as
evidenced by the quantitative agreement between the local elastic stress
sustained by TEZ and the macroscopic stress from rheological measurements at
low and moderate shear rates. Besides the charged-stabilized colloidal
suspension, a hard-sphere colloidal suspension at the same volume fraction and
shear rates was also measured. The result highlights the key role of the
electrostatic interparticle repulsion in promoting the local elasticity. Our
findings provide an understanding on the nonlinear rheology of interacting
colloidal glasses from a micro-mechanical view.

alternative to Gibbs one is used; the transition region is considered as a
separate (surface) phase. An equation for the nucleation work is derived which
is basic for the multivariable theory of nucleation. Equations of equilibrium
following from it are employed for considering the dependences of surface
tension on radius and temperature for droplets; Kelvin formula for the
equilibrium vapor pressure is extended to small radii. It is shown that the
ratio of the isothermal nucleation rate to that of CNT can achieve several
orders of magnitude due to the curvature effect (the dependence of surface
tension on curvature). The analysis of different dependences of the Tolman
length on radius, d(R), suggests that (i) the curvature effect is determined by
the value of d(0) which is positive and relates to the limiting (spinodal)
vapor supersaturation and (ii) the function d(R) decreases with increasing
radius; at the same time, this effect is weakly sensitive to the form of the
function d(R) and its asymptotic value. The second differential of the work is
obtained as a quadratic form with contributions from both the bulk and surface

unimprovable without losing control of the FDR and unlike existing FDR methods;
it cannot be improved even by restricting to the usual positive regression

change. The initial demagnetization process is very fast. Experimentally, it is
found that the demagnetization time is related to the spin moment in the
sample. In this study, we employ the first-principles method to directly
simulate such a process. We use the fixed spin moment method to change the spin
moment in ferromagnetic nickel, and then we employ the Liouville equation to
couple the laser pulse to the system. We find that in general the dependence of
demagnetization time on the spin moment is nonlinear: It decreases with the
spin moment up to a point, after which an increase with the spin moment is
observed, followed by a second decrease. To understand this, we employ an
extended Heisenberg model, which includes both the exchange interaction and
spin-orbit coupling. The model directly links the demagnetization rate to the
spin moment itself and demonstrates analytically that the spin relaxes more
slowly with a small spin moment. A future experimental test of our predictions
is needed.

Lett. {\bf 90}, 247201 (2003)) reported
that when ferromagnetic nickel is subject to an intense ultrashort laser pulse,
its exchange splitting is reduced quickly. But to simulate such reduction
remains a big challenge. The popular rigid band approximation (RBA), where both
the band structure and the exchange splitting are held fixed before and after
laser excitation, is unsuitable for this purpose, while the time-dependent
density functional theory could be time-consuming. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose a time-dependent Liouville and density functional
theory (TDLDFT) that integrates the time-dependent Liouville equation into the
density functional theory. As a result, the excited charge density is
reiterated back into the Kohn-Sham equation, and the band structure is allowed
to change dynamically. Even with the ground-state density functional, a larger
demagnetization than RBA is found; after we expand Ortenzi's spin scaling
method into an excited-state (laser) density functional, we find that the
exchange splitting is indeed strongly reduced, as seen in the experiment. Both
the majority and minority bands are shifted toward the Fermi level, but the
majority shifts a lot more. The ultrafast reduction in exchange splitting
occurs concomitantly with demagnetization. While our current theory is still
unable to yield the same percentage loss in the spin moment as observed in the
experiment, it predicts a correct trend that agrees with the experiments. With
a better functional, we believe that our results can be further improved.

distance) and PM of the GCs. This provides a homogeneous PM study of multiple
GCs based on an astrometric catalog with small and well-controlled systematic
errors, and yields random PM errors similar to existing measurements. Detailed
comparison to the available Hubble Space Telescope (HST) measurements generally
shows excellent agreement, validating the astrometric quality of both TGAS and
HST. By contrast, comparison to ground-based measurements shows that some of
those must have systematic errors exceeding the random errors. Our parallax
estimates have uncertainties an order of magnitude larger than previous
studies, but nevertheless imply distances consistent with previous estimates.
By combining our PM measurements with literature positions, distances, and
radial velocities, we measure Galactocentric space motions for the clusters and
find that these also agree well with previous analyses. Our analysis provides a
framework for determining more accurate distances and PMs of Galactic GCs using

One of them is the efficient use of observations obtained at multiple epochs.
The work presented here addresses faint object detection with multi-epoch data,
and describes an incremental strategy for separating real objects from
artifacts in ongoing surveys, in situations where the single-epoch data are
summaries of the full image data, such as single-epoch catalogs of flux and
direction estimates for candidate sources. The basic idea is to produce
low-threshold single-epoch catalogs, and use a probabilistic approach to
accumulate catalog information across epochs; this is in contrast to more
conventional strategies based on co-added or stacked image data across all
epochs. We adopt a Bayesian approach, addressing object detection by
calculating the marginal likelihoods for hypotheses asserting there is no
object, or one object, in a small image patch containing at most one cataloged
source at each epoch. The object-present hypothesis interprets the sources in a
patch at different epochs as arising from a genuine object; the no-object
(noise) hypothesis interprets candidate sources as spurious, arising from noise
peaks. We study the detection probability for constant-flux objects in a
simplified Gaussian noise setting, comparing results based on single exposures
and stacked exposures to results based on a series of single-epoch catalog
summaries. Computing the detection probability based on catalog data amounts to
generalized cross-matching: it is the product of a factor accounting for
matching of the estimated fluxes of candidate sources, and a factor accounting
for matching of their estimated directions. We find that probabilistic fusion
of multi-epoch catalog information can detect sources with only modest
sacrifice in sensitivity and selectivity compared to stacking.

the rear of a circular cylinder and subjected to laminar pulsatile inflow is
investigated. The cylinder and elastic splitter plate are contained within a
narrow channel and the Reynolds number is mostly restricted to Re = 100,
primarily covering the two-dimensional flow regime. An in-house fluid-structure
interaction code is employed for simulations, which couples a sharp-interface
immersed boundary method for the fluid dynamics with a finite-element method to
treat the structural dynamics. The structural solver is implicitly (two-way)
coupled with the flow solver using a partitioned approach. This implicit
coupling ensures numerical stability at low structure-fluid density ratios. A
power spectrum analysis of the time-varying plate displacement shows that the
plate oscillates at more than a single frequency for pulsatile inflow, compared
to a single frequency observed for steady inflow. The multiple frequencies
obtained for the former case can be explained by beating between the applied
and plate oscillatory signals. The plate attains a self-sustained time-periodic
oscillation with a plateau amplitude in the case of steady flow, while the
superimposition of pulsatile inflow with induced plate oscillation affects the
plateau amplitude. Lock-in of the plate oscillation with the pulsatile inflow
occurs at a forcing frequency that is twice of the plate natural frequency in a
particular mode and this mode depends on the plate length. The plate
displacement as well as pressure drag increases at the lock-in condition. The
percentage change in the maximum plate displacement, and skin-friction and
pressure drag coefficients on the plate, due to pulsatile inflow is quantified.

among antennas because of the limited space for deploying antennas. To reduce
the cost, an optimal equivalent precoding matrix with the minimum number of RF

considering the mutual coupling effect. Moreover, an upper bound of the
effective capacity is derived for 5G multimedia massive MIMO communication

aggregation phase) and the aggregated data is then relayed to base stations
(i.e., relaying phase). Due to the limited resources, the aggregators not only
aggregate data, but also schedule resources among MTDs. We consider two
scheduling schemes: random resource scheduling (RRS) and channel-aware resource

analytical framework to investigate the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) for
each phase, thereby computing the MTD success probability, the average number
of successful MTDs and probability of successful channel utilization, which are
the key metrics characterizing the overall mMTC performance. Our numerical
results show that, although the CRS outperforms the RRS in terms of SIR at the
aggregation phase, the simpler RRS has almost the same performance as the CRS
for most cases with regards to the overall mMTC performance. Furthermore, the
provision of more resources at the aggregation phase is not always beneficial

fold into any connected surface made up of unit squares on the 3D cube
grid--for example, the surface of any polycube. The folding is efficient: for
target surfaces topologically equivalent to a sphere, the strip needs to have
only twice the target surface area, and the folding stacks at most two layers
of material anywhere. These geometric results offer a new way to build
programmable matter that is substantially more efficient than what is possible
with a square $N \times N$ sheet of material, which can fold into all polycubes
only of surface area $O(N)$ and may stack $\Theta(N^2)$ layers at one point. We
also show how our strip foldings can be executed by a rigid motion without
collisions (albeit assuming zero thickness), which is not possible in general
with 2D sheet folding.
  To achieve these results, we develop new approximation algorithms for milling
the surface of a grid polyhedron, which simultaneously give a 2-approximation
in tour length and an 8/3-approximation in the number of turns. Both length and
turns consume area when folding a strip, so we build on past approximation

measured photospheric or chromospheric vector magnetograms are force-free,
using the Maxwell stress as a measure. Some previous studies have suggested
that magnetic fields of active regions in the solar chromosphere are close to
be force-free whereas there is no consistency among previous studies on whether
magnetic fields of active regions in the solar photosphere are force-free or
not. Here we use three kinds of representative magnetic fields (analytical
force-free solutions, modeled solar-like force-free fields and observed
non-force-free fields) to discuss on how the measurement issues such as limited
field of view, instrument sensitivity and measurement error could affect the
estimation of force-freeness based on observed magnetograms. Unlike previous
studies that focus on discussing the effect of limited field of view or
instrument sensitivity, our calculation shows that just measurement error alone
can significantly influence the results of force-freeness estimate, due to the
fact that measurement errors in horizontal magnetic fields are usually ten
times larger than that of the vertical fields. This property of measurement
errors, interacting with the particular form of force-freeness estimate
formula, would result in wrong judgments of the force-freeness: a truly
force-free field may be mistakenly estimated as being non-force-free and a true
non-force-free field may be estimated as being force-free. Our analysis calls
for caution when interpreting the force-freeness estimates based on measured
magnetograms, and also suggests that the true photospheric magnetic field may
be further away from being force-free than they currently appear to be.

schizophrneia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD), but the exact nature of
cardiometabolic (CM) abnormalities involved and the underlying mechanisms
remain unclear. Using polygenic risk scores (PRS) and LD score regression, we
investigated the shared genetic bases of SCZ and BD with a panel of 28
cardiometabolic traits. We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) to elucidate
casual relationships between the two groups of disorders. The analysis was
based on large-scale meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
We also identified the potential shared genetic variants by a statistical
approach based on local true discovery rates, and inferred the pathways
involved. We found polygenic associations of SCZ with glucose metabolism
abnormalities, adverse adipokine profiles, increased wait-hip ratio and raised
visceral adiposity. However, BMI showed inverse genetic correlation and
polygenic link with SCZ. On the other hand, we observed polygenic associations
with an overall favorable CM profile in BD. MR analysis showed that SCZ may be
causally linked to raised triglyceride and that lower fasting glucose may be
linked to BD; otherwise MR did not reveal other significant causal
relationships in general. We also identified numerous SNPs and pathways shared
between SCZ/BD with cardiometabolic traits, some of which are related to
inflammation or the immune system. In conclusion, SCZ patients may be
genetically associated with several CM abnormalities independent of medication
side-effects, and proper surveillance and management of CV risk factors may be
required from the onset of the disease. On the other hand, CM abnormalities in
BD are more likely to be secondary.

independent methods are employed, one for treating $\Cal I^+$ as the future

subsumed in the former, which is of greater generality). Both methods provide
the same result: a constellation of various possible connections, depending on
an arbitrary choice of a certain function, a sort of gauge freedom in obtaining
a natural connection on $\Cal I^+$; choosing that function to be constant (for
instance) results in a complete connection.
  Treating $\Cal I^+$ as part of the future causal boundary, the method is to
impute affine connections on null hypersurfaces going out to $\Cal I^+$, in
terms of a transverse vector field on each null hypersurface (there is much
gauge freedom on choice of the transverse vector fields). Treating $\Cal I^+$

influence of the contribution of the dynamics of produced nonthermal electrons
to electron thermalisation and electron-phonon interaction is thoroughly
investigated within a range of values of the pulse duration (i.e. from 10fs to
2.3ps). The theoretical model elaborates firstly on possible transient changes
of optical parameters during irradiation due to the presence of the
non-equilibrium electrons and the modification of the electron distribution
function in a material characterized by a variable electron density of states
around the Fermi energy. The model correlates the role of nonthermal electrons,
relaxation processes and induced stress-strain fields. Simulations are
presented by choosing Nickel (Ni) as a test material to compute electron-phonon
relaxation time due to its large electron-phonon coupling constant that expects
to reveal more conclusively the influence of the non-equilibrium electrons. We
demonstrate the consideration of the above factors leads to significant changes
compared to the results the traditional Two Temperature Model (TTM) provides.
The proposed model predicts a substantially (~33%) smaller damage threshold and
a large increase of the stress (~20%, at early times) which firstly underlines
the role of the nonthermal electron interactions and secondly enhances its
importance with respect to the precise determination of laser specifications in
material micromachining techniques.

barlenses (lens-like structures embedded in the narrow bar component) are just
the face-on counterparts of Boxy/Peanut/X-shapes (B/P/X) seen in edge-on bars,
or if some additional physical parameter affects that morphology. A range of
bulge-to-disk mass and size ratios are explored: our nominal parameters
($B/D=0.08$, $r_{\rm eff}/h_r=0.07$, disk comprising 2/3 of total force at
$2.2h_r$) correspond to typical MW mass galaxies. In all models a bar with
pronounced B/P/X forms in a few Gyrs, visible in edge-on view. However, the
pure barlens morphology forms only in models with sufficiently steep inner
rotation curves, $dV_{cir}/dr\gtrsim5V_{max}/h_r$, achieved when including a
small classical bulge with $B/D\gtrsim0.02$ and $r_{\rm eff}/h_r\lesssim0.1$.
For shallower slopes the central structure still resembles a barlens, but shows
a clear X-signature even in low inclinations. Similar result holds for
bulgeless simulations, where the central slope is modified by changing the halo
concentration. The predicted sensitivity on inner rotation curve is consistent
with the slopes estimated from gravitational potentials calculated from the
3.6$\mu$m images, for the observed barlens and X-shape galaxies in the Spitzer
Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G). For inclinations $<60^\circ$
the galaxies with barlenses have on average twice steeper inner rotation curves
than galaxies with X-shapes: the limiting slope is $\sim250$km/s/kpc. Among
barred galaxies, those with barlenses have both the strongest bars and the
largest relative excess of inner surface density, both in barlens region
($\lesssim0.5h_r$) and near the center ($\lesssim0.1h_r$); this provides
evidence for bar-driven secular evolution in galaxies.

non-parametric regression whose computation amounts to solving a linear system.
This system is usually dense and highly ill-conditioned. In addition, the
dimensions of the matrix are the same as the number of data points, so direct
methods are unrealistic for large-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a
preconditioning technique for accelerating the solution of the aforementioned
linear system. The preconditioner is based on random feature maps, such as
random Fourier features, which have recently emerged as a powerful technique
for speeding up and scaling the training of kernel-based methods, such as
kernel ridge regression, by resorting to approximations. However, random
feature maps only provide crude approximations to the kernel function, so
delivering state-of-the-art results by directly solving the approximated system
requires the number of random features to be very large. We show that random
feature maps can be much more effective in forming preconditioners, since under
certain conditions a not-too-large number of random features is sufficient to
yield an effective preconditioner. We empirically evaluate our method and show
it is highly effective for datasets of up to one million training examples.

unexplored. We study regularization both in a fairly broad setting, and in the
specific context of the popular and widely used technique of ridge
regularization; for the latter, as applied to each of these problems, we show
algorithmic resource bounds in which the {\em statistical dimension} appears in
places where in previous bounds the rank would appear. The statistical
dimension is always smaller than the rank, and decreases as the amount of
regularization increases. In particular, for the ridge low-rank approximation
problem $\min_{Y,X} \lVert YX - A \rVert_F^2 + \lambda \lVert Y\rVert_F^2 +
\lambda\lVert X \rVert_F^2$, where $Y\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times k}$ and

obtain sketching-based algorithms for the low-rank approximation problem

was very tedious and simultaneous use of all available GPP and GPU resources
required low-level programming to ensure efficient synchronization and data
transfer between processors. However, in the last few years several high-level
programming frameworks have emerged, which enable programmers to describe
applications by means of abstractions such as dataflow or Kahn process networks
and leave parallel execution, data transfer and synchronization to be handled
by the framework.
  Unfortunately, even the most advanced high-level programming frameworks have
had shortcomings that limit their applicability to certain classes of
applications. This paper presents a new, dataflow-flavored programming
framework targeting heterogeneous platforms, and differs from previous
approaches by allowing GPU-mapped actors to have data dependent consumption of
inputs / production of outputs. Such flexibility is essential for configurable
and adaptive applications that are becoming increasingly common in signal
processing. In our experiments it is shown that this feature allows up to 5x
increase in application throughput.
  The proposed framework is validated by application examples from the video

return only a single subset of features, supposedly the one with the highest
predictive power. We argue that in several domains multiple subsets can achieve
close to maximal predictive accuracy, and that arbitrarily providing only one
has several drawbacks. The SES method attempts to identify multiple, predictive
feature subsets whose performances are statistically equivalent. Under that
respect SES subsumes and extends previous feature selection algorithms, like
the max-min parent children algorithm. SES is implemented in an homonym
function included in the R package MXM, standing for mens ex machina, meaning
'mind from the machine' in Latin. The MXM implementation of SES handles several
data-analysis tasks, namely classification, regression and survival analysis.
In this paper we present the SES algorithm, its implementation, and provide
examples of use of the SES function in R. Furthermore, we analyze three
publicly available data sets to illustrate the equivalence of the signatures
retrieved by SES and to contrast SES against the state-of-the-art feature
selection method LASSO. Our results provide initial evidence that the two
methods perform comparably well in terms of predictive accuracy and that

and FCC iron exhibit a very strong attraction with a nearby vacancy (V) at
first neighbour distance (1NN). The attraction it is so large that the 1NN pair
OSA+V is no longer stable and relaxes spontaneously towards a new configuration
where the OSA sits in the middle of the bond, the two ends of which are
decorated with two half-vacancies (V/2). Taking into account the formation of
this complex V/2+OSA+V/2 in the migration process has never been done before:
it requires a new formulation of correlation effects. This is the aim of the
present contribution which establishes the expression of the diffusion
coefficient of the OSA and evaluates exactly the correlation factor in BCC and
FCC lattices, thanks to the introduction of macrojumps. The formalism is
applied to the case of Y in BCC iron and its results are compared to those
obtained by previous authors. It is shown that the smallness of the correlation
factor is not due to the transport mechanism of the OSA but only to the jump
frequencies of the vacancy in the vicinity of the OSA. This smallness of the
correlation factor is however overcompensated by a large macrojump frequency,
and, as a result, the Y atom diffuses more rapidly than iron at all
temperatures by orders of magnitude in the two structures.

application of unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods to the context

many different applications to be able to characterize their structure. Local
quantities fail to give interesting information and it seems that path-related
measures are able to convey relevant information about the organization of
these structures. In particular, nodes with a large betweenness centrality (BC)
display non-trivial patterns, such as central loops. We first discuss empirical
results for different random planar graphs and we then propose a toy model
which allows us to discuss the condition for the emergence of non-trivial
patterns such as central loops. This toy model is made of a star network with
$N_b$ branches of size $n$ and links of weight $1$, superimposed to a loop at
distance $\ell$ from the center and with links of weight $w$. We estimate for
this model the BC at the center and on the loop and we show that the loop can
be more central than the origin if $w<w_c$ where the threshold of this
transition scales as $w_c\sim n/N_b$. In this regime, there is an optimal
position of the loop that scales as $\ell_{opt}\sim N_b w/4$. This simple model
sheds some light on the organization of these random structures and allows us
to discuss the effect of randomness on the centrality of loops. In particular,
it suggests that the number and the spatial extension of radial branches are
the crucial ingredients that control the existence of central loops.

JPEG steganalysis incorporating the domain knowledge behind rich steganalytic
models. Our proposed framework involves two main stages. The first stage is
hand-crafted, corresponding to the convolution phase and the quantization &
truncation phase of the rich models. The second stage is a compound deep neural
network containing multiple deep subnets in which the model parameters are
learned in the training procedure. We provided experimental evidences and
theoretical reflections to argue that the introduction of threshold quantizers,
though disable the gradient-descent-based learning of the bottom convolution
phase, is indeed cost-effective. We have conducted extensive experiments on a
large-scale dataset extracted from ImageNet. The primary dataset used in our
experiments contains 500,000 cover images, while our largest dataset contains
five million cover images. Our experiments show that the integration of
quantization and truncation into deep-learning steganalyzers do boost the
detection performance by a clear margin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our
framework is insensitive to JPEG blocking artifact alterations, and the learned

applications.

previously. Indeed, superconductivity emerges, not on the verge, but deep
inside the magnetic phase. In this context, we have carried out ac-calorimetry,
resistivity and thermoelectric power measurements on a CeAu$_2$Si$_2$-single
crystal under high-pressure. The principal novelties of this experiment are the
observation of a new transition line, presumably a magnetic structure
rearrangement at $T_{\mathrm{M}}^{\mathrm{mod}}$ inside the antiferromagnetic
phase, and the occurrence of quantum critical behavior in resistivity linked to
superconductivity. Strong non-Fermi-liquid behavior is observed around the
maximum of superconductivity and enhanced scattering rates are observed close
to both the emergence and the maximum of superconductivity. Intriguingly,
$T_{\mathrm{M}}^{\mathrm{mod}}$ almost coincides with the onset of the
superconducting transition over a broad pressure range, where mysteriously Tc
increases with the strengthening of magnetism. A comparison of the features in
CeAu$_2$Si$_2$ and its parent compounds CeCu$_2$Si$_2$ and CeCu$_2$Ge$_2$

fluctuations of a valence crossover play a crucial role in the superconducting

illustrates a complex interplay between magnetism, quantum criticality and

has attracted much attention in recent years. Such problems are important in
both theory and practice because their objective functions are very general.
Obtaining further improvements for many submodular maximization problems boils
down to finding better algorithms for optimizing a relaxation of them known as
the multilinear extension.
  In this work we present an algorithm for optimizing the multilinear
relaxation whose guarantee improves over the guarantee of the best previous
algorithm (which was given by Ene and Nguyen (2016)). Moreover, our algorithm
is based on a new technique which is, arguably, simpler and more natural for
the problem at hand. In a nutshell, previous algorithms for this problem rely
on symmetry properties which are natural only in the absence of a constraint.
Our technique avoids the need to resort to such properties, and thus, seems to
be a better fit for constrained problems.

cohesive subgraphs on social networks considering both user engagement and
similarity perspectives. In particular, we adopt the popular concept of k-core
to guarantee the engagement of the users (vertices) in a group (subgraph) where
each vertex in a (k,r)-core connects to at least k other vertices. Meanwhile,
we also consider the pairwise similarity between users based on their profiles.
For a given similarity metric and a similarity threshold r, the similarity
between any two vertices in a (k,r)-core is ensured not less than r. Efficient
algorithms are proposed to enumerate all maximal (k,r)-cores and find the
maximum (k,r)-core, where both problems are shown to be NP-hard. Effective
pruning techniques significantly reduce the search space of two algorithms and
a novel (k,k')-core based (k,r)-core size upper bound enhances performance of
the maximum (k,r)-core computation. We also devise effective search orders to
accommodate the different nature of two mining algorithms. Comprehensive
experiments on real-life data demonstrate that the maximal/maximum (k,r)-cores
enable us to find interesting cohesive subgraphs, and performance of two mining

neutrino mass generation. Specifically we extend the standard model by two real
singlet scalars, two singly charged scalars carrying different lepton numbers
and two or more singlet fermions with Majorana masses. Our model respects a
softly broken lepton number and an exactly conserved $Z_2^{}$ discrete
symmetry. Through the lepton-number-violating decays of the real scalars and
then the lepton-number-conserving decays of the charged scalars, we can obtain
a lepton asymmetry stored in the standard model leptons. This lepton asymmetry
can be partially converted to a baryon asymmetry by the sphaleron processes.
The interactions for this leptogenesis can also result in a three-loop diagram
to generate the neutrino masses. The lightest singlet fermion can keep stable
to serve as a dark matter particle.

time when a huge cloud complex was present at 30 - 40N. We imaged Uranus in
seven filters spanning 467 - 924 nm, and analysed these observations with the
NEMESIS radiative-transfer and retrieval code.
  The same system was also observed in the H-band with VLT/SINFONI ON 31st
October and 11th November (Irwin et al., 2016). To constrain the background
cloud particle sizes and scattering properties we conducted a limb-darkening
analysis of the background cloud structure at 30-40N by simultaneously fitting:
a) these HST/OPAL observations at a range of zenith angles; b) the VLT/SINFONI
observations at a range of zenith angles; and c) IRTF/SpeX observations made in
2009 (Irwin et al., 2015).
  We find that the observations are well modelled with a three-component cloud
comprised of: 1) a vertically thin, but optically thick 'deep' tropospheric
cloud at a pressure of ~2 bars; 2) a methane-ice cloud at the
methane-condensation level with variable vertical extent; and 3) a vertically
extended tropospheric haze. We find that the particles sizes in both haze and
tropospheric cloud have an effective radius of ~0.1 micron, although we cannot
rule out larger particle sizes in the tropospheric cloud.
  We find that the particles in both the tropospheric cloud and haze are more
scattering at short wavelengths, giving them a blue colour, but are more
absorbing at longer wavelengths, especially for the tropospheric haze. For the
particles in the storm clouds, which we assume to be composed of methane ice
particles, we find that their mean radii must be ~0.5 micron. We find that the
high clouds have low integrated opacity, and that ""streamers"" reminiscent of
thunderstorm anvils are confined to levels deeper than 1 bar. These results
argue against vigorous moist convective origins for the cloud features.

computation systems. Compared to the traditional MOSFET device, the memristor
is efficient over energy and area. But one of the biggest challenges faced with
researchers is how to program a memristor's resistance precisely. Recently, an
algorithm designed to save 8 valid bits in each memristor is proposed, but this
is still not sufficient for precise computation. In this paper, we propose a
crossbar-based memristor computation scheme supporting precise computations
whose operands have 32 valid bits. As a brief introduction, in a multiplication
with two operands, one operand is programmed as input signal, and the other
operand is saved into a so-called crossbar structure, which contains a group of
memristors, and each memristor saves several valid bits, usually one or two
bits only. The computation results,i.e. the multiplication of the two operands,
are contained in the outputs of the crossbar structure together with noise.
Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) are then used to extract the valid bits,
which are the most significant bits of outputs. These valid bits can be
combined together with Digital-to-Analog Converters(DACs) to get the final
results. What's more, the precision of this computation scheme can be adjusted
according to the definition of the user, 32 valid bits at most, so it is
qualified for different application contexts.

homogeneous cooling state is performed to study the conditions for stability of
a suspension of solid particles immersed in a viscous gas. The dissipation in
such systems arises from two different sources: inelasticity in particle
collisions and viscous friction dissipation due to the influence of gas phase
on solid particles. The starting point is a suspension model based on the
(inelastic) Enskog kinetic equation where the effect of the interstitial gas
phase on the dynamics of grains is modeled via a viscous drag force. The study
is carried out in two different steps. First, the transport coefficients of the
system are obtained by solving the Enskog equation by means of the
Chapman-Enskog method up to first order in spatial gradients. Once the
transport properties are known, then the corresponding linearized hydrodynamic
equations are solved to get the dispersion relations. In contrast to previous
studies [V. Garz\'o \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{93}, 012905 (2016)],
the hydrodynamic modes are \emph{analytically} obtained as functions of the
parameter space of the system. As expected, linear stability shows $d-1$
transversal (shear) modes (where $d$ is the dimensionality of the system) and a
longitudinal ""heat"" mode to be unstable with respect to long enough wavelength
excitations. The results also show that the main effect of gas phase is to
decrease the value of the critical length $L_c$ (beyond which the system
becomes unstable) with respect to its value for a dry granular fluid.
Comparison with direct numerical simulations for $L_c$ shows a good agreement

most interesting parts of the scene, and detecting them plays an important role
in the analysis of visual data. Our method is based on the observation that
matching static points must satisfy the epipolar geometry constraints, but
computing exact matches is challenging. Instead, we compute the probability
that a pixel has a match, not necessarily the correct one, along the
corresponding epipolar line. The complement of this probability is not
necessarily the probability of a dynamic point because of occlusions, noise,
and matching errors. Therefore, information from all pairs of images is
aggregated to obtain a high quality dynamic probability map, per image.
Experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the

reduction and identification of linear systems, deriving nonlinear low-order
models still is a chal- lenging task. In this work, we develop a new
data-driven framework to identify nonlinear reduced-order models of a fluid by
combining dimensionality reductions techniques (e.g. proper orthogonal
decomposition) and sparse regression techniques from machine learn- ing. In
particular, we extend the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)
algorithm to enforce physical constraints in the regression, namely
energy-preserving quadratic nonlinearities. The resulting models, hereafter
referred to as Galerkin regression models, incorporate many beneficial aspects
of Galerkin projection, but without the need for a full-order or high-fidelity
solver to project the Navier-Stokes equations. Instead, the most parsimonious
nonlinear model is determined that is consistent with observed mea- surement
data and satisfies necessary constraints. Galerkin regression models also
readily generalize to include higher-order nonlinear terms that model the
effect of truncated modes. The effectiveness of Galerkin regression is
demonstrated on two different flow configurations: the two-dimensional flow
past a circular cylinder and the shear-driven cavity flow. For both cases, the
accuracy of the identified models compare favorably against reduced-order
models obtained from a standard Galerkin projection procedure. Present results
highlight the importance of cubic nonlinearities in the construction of
accurate nonlinear low-dimensional approximations of the flow systems,
something which cannot be readily obtained using a standard Galerkin projection
of the Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, the entire code base for our
constrained sparse Galerkin regression algorithm is freely available online.

nonrelativistic particle coupled in a translation invariant manner. The
particle is also subject to a confining external potential. The stationary
solutions of the system are a Coulomb type wave field centered at those
particle positions for which the external force vanishes. We prove that
solutions of finite energy converge, in suitable local energy seminorms, to the
set ${\cal S}$ of all stationary states in the long time limit $t\to\pm\infty$.
Further we show that the rate of relaxation to a stable stationary state is
determined by spatial decay of initial data. The convergence is followed by the
radiation of the dispersion wave which is a solution to the free wave equation.
  Similar relaxation has been proved previously for the case of relativistic
particle when the speed of the particle is less than the speed of light. Now we
extend these results to nonrelativistic particle with arbitrary superlight
velocity. However, we restrict ourselves by the plane particle trajectories.
The extension to general case remains an open problem.

and emission measure). However, without an indication of the low-frequency
turnover in the free-free spectrum, these properties remain difficult to

abundance trends with metallicity are still relatively poorly known at [Fe/H] <

the metal-poor stars, in part due to shortcomings in 1D LTE abundance analyses.
In this study we determined the oxygen abundance in the metal-poor halo giant
HD 122563 using a 3D hydrodynamical CO5BOLD model atmosphere. Our main goal was
to understand whether a 3D LTE analysis may help to improve the reliability of
oxygen abundances determined from OH UV lines in comparison to those obtained
using standard 1D LTE methodology. The oxygen abundance in HD 122563 was
determined using 71 OH UV lines located in the wavelength range between 308-330
nm. The analysis was done using a high-resolution VLT UVES spectrum with a 1D
LTE spectral line synthesis performed using the SYNTHE package and classical
ATLAS9 model atmosphere. Subsequently, a 3D hydrodynamical CO5BOLD, and 1D
hydrostatic LHD model atmospheres were used in order to compute 3D-1D abundance
corrections. For this, the microturbulence velocity used with the 1D LHD model
atmosphere was derived from the hydrodynamical CO5BOLD model atmosphere. As in
previous studies, we found trends of the 1D LTE oxygen abundances determined
from OH UV lines with line parameters, such as the line excitation potential
and the line strength. These trends become significantly less pronounced in 3D
LTE. Using OH UV lines we determined a 3D LTE oxygen abundance in HD 122563 of
A(O) = 6.23 +/- 0.13. This is in fair agreement with the oxygen abundance
obtained from OH IR lines, A(O) = 6.39 +/- 0.11, but it is noticeably lower
than that determined using the forbidden [OI] line, A(O) = 6.53 +/- 0.15. While
the exact cause for this discrepancy remains unclear, it is very likely that
non-LTE effects may play a decisive role here.

ongoing challenge in physics. A particular instance are phase transitions that
occur between a non-fluctuating absorbing phase, e.g., an extinct population,
and one in which the relevant order parameter, such as the population density,
assumes a finite value. Here we report the observation of signatures of such a
non-equilibrium phase transition in an open driven quantum system. In our
experiment rubidium atoms in a quasi one-dimensional cold disordered gas are
laser-excited to Rydberg states under so-called facilitation conditions. This
conditional excitation process competes with spontaneous decay and leads to a
crossover between a stationary state with no excitations and one with a finite
number of excitations. We relate the underlying physics to that of an absorbing
state phase transition in the presence of a field (i.e. off-resonant excitation
processes) which slightly offsets the system from criticality. We observe a
characteristic power-law scaling of the Rydberg excitation density as well as
increased fluctuations close to the transition point. Furthermore, we argue
that the observed transition relies on the presence of atomic motion which
introduces annealed disorder into the system and enables the formation of
long-ranged correlations. Our study paves the road for future investigations
into the largely unexplored physics of non-equilibrium phase transitions in
open many-body quantum systems.

analysis of these events is of interest for the space weather as well as the
solar event community. In this work, SEP events with protons accelerated to
above 500 MeV have been identified using data from the Electron Proton Helium
Instrument (EPHIN) aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) between
1995 and 2015. For a statistical analysis, onset times have been determined for
the events and the proton energy spectra were derived and fitted with a power
law. As a result, a list of 42 SEP events with protons accelerated to above 500
MeV measured with the EPHIN instrument onboard SOHO is presented. The
statistical analysis based on the fitted spectral slopes and absolute
intensities is discussed with special emphasis on whether or not an event has
been observed as GLE. Furthermore, a correlation between the derived intensity
at 500 MeV and the observed increase in neutron monitor count rate has been
found for a subset of events.

short-period M dwarf binaries with components of similar mass, radius inflation

models. Specifically, we study the influence of additive white Gaussian noise
on the sequence of the glacial cycles generated by stochastic versions of
several low-order dynamical system models proposed in the literature. In the
original deterministic case, the models exhibit different types of attractors:
a quasiperiodic attractor, a piecewise continuous attractor, strange nonchaotic
attractors, and a chaotic attractor. We show that the combination of the
quasiperiodic astronomical forcing and additive fluctuations induce a form of
temporarily quantised instability. More precisely, climate trajectories
corresponding to different noise realizations generally cluster around a small
number of stable or transiently stable trajectories present in the
deterministic system. Furthermore, these stochastic trajectories may show
sensitive dependence on very small amounts of perturbations at key times.
Consistently with the complexity of each attractor, the number of trajectories
leaking from the clusters may range from almost zero (the model with a
quasiperiodic attractor) to a significant fraction of the total (the model with
a chaotic attractor), the models with strange nonchaotic attractors being
intermediate. Finally, we discuss the implications of this investigation for

recent studies found that WFs could be AGB stars or even early planetary
nebulae. This fact prompted the idea that WFs may not necessarily be objects at
the beginning of the morphological transition process. In the present work, we
show that WFs could have different envelope morphologies by studying their
spectral energy distribution profiles. Some WFs have spherical envelopes that
resembles usual AGB stars, while others have aspherical envelopes which are
more common to post-AGB stars. The results imply that WFs may not represent the
earliest stage of the morphological metamorphosis. We further argue that the
dynamical age of a WF jet, which can be calculated from maser proper motions,
may not be the real age of the jet. The dynamical age cannot be used to justify
the moment when the envelope begins to become aspherical, nor to tell the
concrete evolutionary status of the object. A WF jet could be the innermost
part of a larger well-developed jet, which is not necessarily a young jet.

In particular, the paper sheds light on the shrinkage-like interpretation of
the procedure, where the target is the homoscedastic model: this is not only
related to how close to the target the estimated scales are, but extends to the

non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, as a basis for the development of
coarse-grained models of turbulence. The mechanics of the generalized Langevin
equation (GLE) are considered and insight gained from the orthogonal dynamics
equation is used as a starting point for model development. A class of sub-grid
models is considered which represent non-local behavior via a finite memory
approximation (Stinis, P., ""Mori-Zwanzig reduced models for uncertainty
quantification I: Parametric uncertainty,"" \textit{arXiv:1211.4285}, 2012.),
the length of which is determined using a heuristic that is related to the
spectral radius of the Jacobian of the resolved variables. The resulting models
are intimately tied to the underlying numerical resolution and are capable of
approximating non-Markovian effects. Numerical experiments on the Burgers
equation demonstrate that the M-Z-based models can accurately predict the
temporal evolution of the total kinetic energy and the total dissipation rate
at varying mesh resolutions. The trajectory of each resolved mode in
phase-space is accurately predicted for cases where the coarse-graining is
moderate. LES of homogeneous isotropic turbulence and the Taylor Green Vortex
show that the M-Z-based models are able to provide excellent predictions,
accurately capturing the sub-grid contribution to energy transfer. Lastly, LES
of fully developed channel flow demonstrate the applicability of M-Z-based
models to non-decaying problems. It is notable that the form of the closure is
not imposed by the modeler, but is rather derived from the mathematics of the

bosons in the simplest extension of the Standard Model (SM) by a neutral
complex singlet (cSMCS). This model has an additional source of CP violation
and provides strong enough first-order electroweak phase transition to generate
the baryon asymmetry of universe (BAU). The scalar spectrum of the cSMCS
includes three neutral Higgs particles with the lightest one considered to be
the 125 GeV Higgs boson found at LHC. The SM-like Higgs boson comes mostly from
the SM-like SU(2) doublet, with a small correction from the singlet. To predict
the production rates of the Higgs bosons, we use a conventional effective LO
QCD framework and the unintegrated parton distribution functions (UPDF) of
Kimber-Martin-Ryskin (KMR). We first compute the SM Higgs production
cross-section and compare the results to the existing theoretical calculations
from different frameworks as well as the experimental data from the CMS and
ATLAS collaborations. It is shown that our framework is capable of producing
sound predictions for these high-energy QCD events in the SM. Afterwards we
present our predictions for the Higgs boson production in the cSMCS.

M0, with periods of about 20 days. We find that the LSP phenomenon is also
first detectable at about M0. Pulsation and LSP amplitudes increase from near
zero to about 0.1 at pulsation periods of about 100 days. At longer periods,
the pulsation amplitudes continue to increase, but the LSP amplitudes are
generally between 0.1 and 0.2 on average. The ratios of LSP to pulsation period
cluster around 5 and 10, presumably depending on whether the pulsation period
is the fundamental or first overtone. The pulsation and LSP phase curves are
generally close to sinusoidal, except when the amplitude is small, in which
case they may be distorted by observational scatter or, in the case of the LSP
amplitude, by the pulsational variability. As with longer-period stars, the LSP
amplitude increases and decreases by a factor of two or more, for unknown
reasons, on a median time scale of about 20 LSPs. The LSP phenomenon is thus
present and simiklar in radially pulsating red giants of all periods. Its cause

explore a prototype 4-terminal semiconducting device formed by two crossed
armchair GNRs (AGNRs) using state-of-the-art first-principles transport
methods. We analyze in detail the roles of intersection angle, stacking order,
inter-GNR separation, and finite voltages on the transport characteristics.
Interestingly, when the AGNRs intersect at $\theta= 60^\circ$, electrons
injected from one terminal can be split into two outgoing waves with a tunable
ratio around 50% and with almost negligible back-reflection. The splitted
electron wave is found to propagate partly straight across the intersection
region in one ribbon and partly in one direction of the other ribbon, i.e., in
analogy of an optical beam splitter. Our simulations further identify realistic
conditions for which this semiconducting device can act as a mechanically
controllable electronic beam splitter with possible applications in
carbon-based quantum electronic circuits and electron optics. We rationalize
our findings with a simple model that suggests that electronic beam splitters
can generally be realized with crossed GNRs.

early periods the time variable was discrete instead of smooth. Alternatively,
and perhaps equivalently, it could be the consequence that the metrics of the
early universe was a strongly concentrated gravitational coherent state with
very high frequency oscillations, allowing local pair creations by a
generalisation to gravity of the Schwinger mechanism, perhaps by creation of
black holes of masses superior to the Planck scale. The lattice spacing between
two clicks in the discrete time picture corresponds to the inverse frequency of
the gravitational coherent state in the other picture. In both cases, a much
lower time than the Planck time might represent a new fundamental scale, giving
new type of physics. To make possible a concrete estimation of the pair
production probability, we propose that the oscillating coherent state metrics
that defines this very early geometry minimises the Einstein gravity action
coupled to interacting 1-,2- and 3-forms. Part of our intuition relies on a
condensed matter analogy with laser-induced superconductivity. An independent
section suggests that the new physical time scale we introduce for the
Markovian discret time of the pre-inflation epoch can be identified with the
stochastic time one uses for standard quantisation in the post-inflation limit.
In the pre-inflation phase its discreteness is the observable driving force for
the universe evolution, while in the post inflation phase it becomes
unobservable and it can can effectively replaced by the continuous time
coordinate of standard quantum field theory.

The near-field dipolar interaction between the localized surface plasmons gives

collective plasmonic excitations. At the edge of the Brillouin zone, the
spectrum is of a pseudorelativistic nature similar to that present in the

Therefore, the plasmonic lattice exhibits similar effects to those found for
electrons in one-dimensional Dirac materials, such as the ability for
transmission with highly suppressed backscattering due to Klein tunneling. We
also show that the system is governed by a nontrivial Zak phase, which predicts
the manifestation of edge states in the chain. When two dimerized chains with
different topological phases are connected, we find the appearance of the
bosonic version of a Jackiw-Rebbi midgap state. We further investigate the

real world as often done in mobile AR applications or using the Magic Mirror
metaphor, where users can see themselves with augmented graphics on a large
display. Such Magic Mirror systems have been used in digital clothing
environments to create virtual dressing rooms, to teach human anatomy, and for
collaborative design tasks. The term Magic Mirror implies that the display
shows the users enantiomorph, i.e. the mirror image, such that the system
mimics a real-world physical mirror. However, the question arises whether one
should design a traditional mirror, or instead display the true mirror image by
means of a non-reversing mirror? This is an intriguing perceptual question, as
the image one observes in a mirror is not a real view, as it would be seen by
an external observer, but a reflection, i.e. a front-to-back reversed image. In
this paper, we discuss the perceptual differences between these two mirror
visualization concepts and present a first comparative study in the context of
Magic Mirror anatomy teaching. We investigate the ability of users to identify
the correct placement of virtual anatomical structures in our screen-based AR
system for two conditions: a regular mirror and a non-reversing mirror setup.
The results of our study indicate that the latter is more suitable for
applications where previously acquired domain-specific knowledge plays an
important role. The lessons learned open up new research directions in the
fields of user interfaces and interaction in non-reversing mirror environments

is typically assumed; however, since early stages of this technology it has
been known that nature points to correlated effects. In statistics, graphical
models have been identified as a useful and powerful tool for covariance
estimation in high dimensional problems and it is an area that has recently
experienced a great expansion. In particular, Gaussian concentration graph
models (GCGM) have been widely studied. These are models in which the
distribution of a set of random variables, the marker effects in this case, is
assumed to be Markov with respect to an undirected graph G. In this paper,
Bayesian (Bayes G and Bayes G-D) and frequentist (GML-BLUP) methods adapting
the theory of GCGM to genome-wide prediction were developed. Different
approaches to define the graph G based on domain-specific knowledge were
proposed, and two propositions and a corollary establishing conditions to find
decomposable graphs were proven. These methods were implemented in small
simulated and real datasets. In our simulations, scenarios where correlations
among allelic substitution effects were expected to arise due to various causes
were considered, and graphs were defined on the basis of physical marker
positions. Results showed improvements in correlation between phenotypes and
predicted breeding values and accuracies of predicted breeding values when
accounting for partially correlated allele substitution effects. Extensions to
the multiallelic loci case were described and some possible refinements
incorporating more flexible priors in the Bayesian setting were discussed. Our
models are promising because they allow incorporation of biological information
in the prediction process, and because they are more flexible and general than
other models accounting for correlated marker effects that have been proposed
previously.

understand fundamental processes of how terrestrial planets evolve and how they

EnVision orbiter proposal for the M5 opportunity, many scientific questions
also require in situ Venus exploration. ESA has already explored Venus entry /
descent probe science in its Planetary Entry Probe (PEP) study [ESA PEP study,
2010], and Venus balloon science in its Venus Entry Probe Study [ESA VEP study,
2005]; Venus balloons were also explored in detail by the European Venus
Explorer (EVE) M1/M2 and M3 proposals [Chassefiere et al., 2009; Wilson et al.,
2012]. While those in situ mission concepts remain scientifically compelling
and technically feasible, the present call requests new scientific concepts.
Therefore, in the present document, we suggest a long-duration lander at Venus,
which would be capable of undertaking a seismometry mission, operating in the
460{\deg}C surface conditions of Venus.

Starting from the full set of Euler equations, we propose a variational
characterization of solutions that encodes the conservation of mass, energy,

a conforming Galerkin approximation in space which automatically inherits the
basic physical conservation laws. Three different spaces are used for
approximation of density, mass flux, and temperature, and we consider a mixed
finite element method as one possible choice of suitable approximation spaces.
We also investigate the subsequent discretization in time by a problem adapted
implicit time stepping scheme for which exact conservation of mass as well as a
slight dissipation of energy and increase of entropy are proven which are due
to the numerical dissipation of the implicit time discretization. The main
arguments of our analysis are rather general and allow us to extend the
approach with minor modification to more general boundary conditions and flow
models taking into account friction, viscosity, heat conduction, and heat
exchange with the surrounding medium.

men and women, 89.7% (35/39) and 66.7% (48/72) of vertebrae with ABQ grade-1
fracture had SQ grade-1 deformity. For grade-1 change, SQ (-, negative without

to have a lower BMD than the SQ(+)& ABQ(-) subjects. In subjects with SQ
grade-2 deformity, those were also ABQ(+) tended to have a lower BMD than those

  equations",,,"10.1093/imanum/drx022",,"math.NA q-fin.MF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a numerical algorithm for backward stochastic differential
equations based on time discretization and trigonometric wavelets. This method
combines the effectiveness of Fourier-based methods and the simplicity of a
wavelet-based formula, resulting in an algorithm that is both accurate and easy
to implement. Furthermore, we mitigate the problem of errors near the
computation boundaries by means of an antireflective boundary technique, giving
an improved approximation. We test our algorithm with different numerical
experiments.

modelled using Langevin processes with specular reflection conditions. The
article presents a discretisation scheme and offers a conjecture for the rate
of convergence of the bias produced. Numerically, these conjectures are
confirmed for the specular reflection scheme but also for the absorption
scheme, which models perfect agglomeration.

the SU(3) Polyakov linear-sigma model is utilized. In mean field approximation,
the dependence of various magnetic properties such as magnetization, magnetic
susceptibility and magnetic catalysis is analyzed in finite magnetic field.
Furthermore, the influences of finite magnetic field on the temperature

game-theoretic learning algorithms. The method enables the comparison of
short-term behaviour of learning algorithms intended for practical use. The
procedure of comparison is automated and it can be tuned for accuracy and
speed. Users can choose from among various learning algorithms to select a
suitable one for a given practical problem. The powerful performance of the
method is enabled by a novel behaviour-similarity-relation, which compacts
large state spaces into small ones. The stochastic model checking tool is
tested on a set of examples classified into four categories to demonstrate the
effectiveness of selecting suitable algorithms for distributed decision making.

  Deployment from Ray-Based Simulations","IEEE 21st International Workshop on Computer Aided Modelling and
  Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD), October 2016",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Future dense small-cell networks are one key 5G candidates to offer outdoor
high access data rates, especially in millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands.
At those frequencies, the free space propagation loss and shadowing (from
buildings, vegetation or any kind of obstacles) are far stronger than in the
traditional radio cellular spectrum. Therefore, the cell range is expected to
be limited to 50 - 100 meters, and directive high gain antennas are required at
least for the base stations. This paper investigates the kind of topology that
is required to serve a suburban area with a small-cell network operating at 60
GHz and equipped with beam-steering antennas. A real environment is considered
to introduce practical deployment and propagation constraints. The analysis
relies on Monte-Carlo system simulations with non-full buffer, and ray-based
predictions. The ray-tracing techniques are today identified as a relevant
solution to capture the main channel properties impacting the beam-steering
performance (angular dispersion, inter-link correlation); and the one involved
in the present study was specifically enhanced to deal with detailed vegetation
modeling. In addition to the user outage, the paper evaluates the evolution of
the inter-cell interference along with the user density, and investigates the
network behavior in case of local strong obstructions.

the einsteinian formulation based on the photoelectric effect. Einstein's
photon concept allow the quantization of the electromagnetic field, but does
not dwell on the idea of photon as particle. The objective of this paper was to
demonstrate that the photon has its origin essentially in the special
relativity, the electromagnetic theory and in the symmetry between the
Lorentz's transformations associated flat monochromatic electromagnetic waves
and particles with zero rest mass. This approach allows to understand the
wave-particle duality of photon and allows to propose an alternative teaching
focused on this duality to develop the course of modern physics.
