nodes connected to a Base Station (BS) over a multiple access channel. The
objective is to adapt their transmission strategy to the state of the network,
including the energy available to the individual nodes. In order to reduce the
complexity of control, an optimization framework is proposed where energy
storage dynamics are replaced by dynamic average power constraints induced by
the time correlated energy supply, thus enabling lightweight and flexible
network control. Specifically, the BS adapts the packet transmission
probability of the ""active"" nodes (those currently under a favorable energy
harvesting state) so as to maximize the average long-term throughput, under
these dynamic average power constraints. The resulting policy takes the form of
the packet transmission probability as a function of the energy harvesting
state and number of active nodes. The structure of the throughput-optimal
genie-aided policy, in which the number of active nodes is known non-causally
at the BS, is proved. Inspired by the genie-aided policy, a Bayesian estimation
approach is presented to address the case where the BS estimates the number of
active nodes based on the observed network transmission pattern. It is shown
that the proposed scheme outperforms by 20% a scheme in which the nodes operate
based on local state information only, and performs well even when energy
storage dynamics are taken into account.

applied to the squared centered, is very vulnerable to outliers and impractical
for heavy-tailed data, which leads us to contemplate test statistics based on
alternative, less outlier-sensitive scale estimators.
  It turns out that the tests based on Gini's mean difference (the average of
all pairwise distances) or generalized Qn estimators (sample quantiles of all
pairwise distances) are very suitable candidates. They improve upon the
classical test not only under heavy tails or in the presence of outliers, but
also under normality. An explanation for this at first counterintuitive result
is that the corresponding long-run variance estimates are less affected by a
scale change than in the case of the sample-variance-based test.
  We use recent results on the process convergence of U-statistics and
U-quantiles for dependent sequences to derive the limiting distribution of the
test statistics and propose estimators for the long-run variance. We perform a
simulations study to investigate the finite sample behavior of the test and
their power. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of the new

contributes $p_{i,j}\in \mathbb{R}$ to the load of machine $i$, with the goal
of minimizing the makespan, i.e., the maximum load of any machine in the

sequentially one by one, and the jobs choose themselves the machine on which
they will be scheduled, aiming at being scheduled on a machine with small load.
We measure the inefficiency of a schedule as the ratio of the makespan obtained
in the worst-case equilibrium schedule, and of the optimum makespan. This ratio
is known as the \emph{sequential price of anarchy}. We also introduce two
alternative inefficiency measures, which allow for a favorable choice of the
order in which the jobs make their decisions. As our first result, we disprove
the conjecture of Hassin and Yovel claiming that the sequential price of
anarchy for $m=2$ machines is at most 3. We show that the sequential price of
anarchy grows at least linearly with the number $n$ of players, i.e., we show
that $SPoA = \Omega(n)$. Furthermore, we show that there exists an order of the
jobs, resulting in makespan that is at most linearly larger than the optimum
makespan. To the end, we show that if an authority can change the order of the
jobs adaptively to the decisions made by the jobs so far (but cannot influence
the decisions of the jobs), then there exists an adaptive ordering in which the
jobs end up in an optimum schedule.

galaxy surveys provides a unique probe of the growth of large-scale structure.
However, systematic effects arise when including satellite galaxies in the
clustering analysis. Since satellite galaxies tend to reside in massive halos
with a greater halo bias, the inclusion boosts the clustering power. In
addition, virial motions of the satellite galaxies cause a significant
suppression of the clustering power due to nonlinear RSD effects. We develop a
novel method to recover the redshift-space power spectrum of halos from the
observed galaxy distribution by minimizing the contamination of satellite
galaxies. The cylinder grouping method (CGM) we study effectively excludes
satellite galaxies from a galaxy sample. However, we find that this technique
produces apparent anisotropies in the reconstructed halo distribution over all
the scales which mimic RSD. On small scales, the apparent anisotropic
clustering is caused by exclusion of halos within the anisotropic cylinder used
by the CGM. On large scales, the misidentification of different halos in the
large-scale structures, aligned along the line-of-sight, into the same CGM
group, causes the apparent anisotropic clustering via their cross-correlation
with the CGM halos. We construct an empirical model for the CGM halo power
spectrum, which includes correction terms derived using the CGM window function
at small scales as well as the linear matter power spectrum multiplied by a
simple anisotropic function at large scales. We apply this model to a mock
galaxy catalog at z=0.5, designed to resemble SDSS-III BOSS CMASS galaxies, and
find that our model can predict both the monopole and quadrupole power spectra

most attractive means of lowering the UK greenhouse gas emissions, whereas
opponents noted that it would result in an unnecessary and burdensome
additional expense to industry and households. Subsequently there have been
calls for the wind fleet target to be further increased to perhaps 50 percent
of demand. Although the National Grid has had little difficulty in
accommodating the current output of about 10 percent of the total demand on the
grid, this will not be the case for a substantially larger wind fleet. When the
wind blows strongly, turbines shed wind which is surplus to demand, leading to
significant reductions in generating efficiency. The purpose of the research
described in this paper has been to develop a method for investigating the
likely performance of future large wind fleets. The method relies on the use of
mathematical models based on National Grid records for 2013 to 2015, each year
being separately analysed. It was found that the incremental load factor of the

engineering applications is the large number of grid points required near
walls. To mitigate this issue, researchers often couple LES with a simplified
model of the flow close to the wall, known as the wall model. One feature
common to most wall models is that the first few (about 3) grid points must be
located below the inviscid log-layer, and the grid must have near-isotropic
resolution near the wall. Hence, wall-modeled LES may still require a large
number of grid points in both the wall-normal and span-wise directions. Because
of these requirements, wall-modeled LES is still unfeasible in many
applications. We present a new formulation of wall-modeled LES that is being
developed to address this issue. In this formulation, LES is used to solve only
for the features of the velocity field that can be adequately represented on
the LES grid. The effects of the unresolved features are captured by imposing
an integral balance of kinetic energy in the near-wall region. This integral
energy balance translates into a dynamic partial differential equation defined
on the walls, which is coupled to the LES equations. We discuss details of the
new formulation and present results obtained in laminar channel flows.

of biological cells. It relies on many processes, but one of the most important
is a {\it homologous recombination}, in which the repair of breaks in
double-stranded DNA molecules is taking place with a help of several specific
proteins. In bacteria this task is accomplished by RecA proteins that are
active as nucleoprotein filaments formed on single-stranded segments of DNA. A
critical step in the homologous recombination is a search for a corresponding
homologous region on DNA, which is called a {\it homology search}. Recent
single-molecule experiments clarified some aspects of this process, but its
molecular mechanisms remain not well understood. We developed a quantitative
theoretical approach to analyze the homology search. It is based on a
discrete-state stochastic model that takes into account the most relevant
physical-chemical processes in the system. Using a method of first-passage
processes, a full dynamic description of the homology search is presented. It
is found that the search dynamics depends on the degree of extension of DNA

experimental single-molecule measurements of DNA pairing by RecA proteins. Our
theoretical calculations, supported by extensive Monte Carlo computer
simulations, provide a molecular description of the mechanisms of the homology

the human body moving in space and the biomechanics of the muscles generating
the forces acting on the body under sophisticated sensory-motor control. One
way to characterize movement performance is through measures of energy
efficiency that relate the mechanical energy of the body and metabolic energy
expended by the muscles. We expect the practical utility of such measures to be
greater when human subjects execute movements that maximize energy efficiency.
We therefore seek to understand if and when subjects select movements with that
maximizing energy efficiency. We proceed using a model-based approach to
describe movements which perform a task requiring the body to add or remove
external mechanical work to or from an object. We use the specific example of
walking gaits doing external mechanical work by pulling a cart, and estimate
the relationship between the avg. walking speed and avg. step length. In the
limit where no external work is done, we find that the estimated maximum energy
efficiency walking gait is much slower than the walking gaits healthy adults
typically select. We then modify the situation of the walking gait by
introducing an idealized mechanical device that creates an adjustable
mechanical advantage. The walking gaits that maximize the energy efficiency
using the optimal mechanical advantage are again much slower than the walking
gaits healthy adults typically select. We finally modify the situation so that
the avg. walking speed is fixed and derive the pattern of the avg. step length
and mechanical advantage that maximize energy efficiency.

strong flux modulation at ~15h is observed at all energy bands, consistent with
the beat frequency between spin and orbital periods. Optical spectra show

While the purpose of calibration is to reduce bias and uncertainty in the

impossible to implement. We study a challenging problem called
\emph{self-calibration}, i.e., the task of designing an algorithm for devices
so that the algorithm is able to perform calibration automatically. More
precisely, we consider the setup $\boldsymbol{y} = \mathcal{A}(\boldsymbol{d})
\boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ where only partial information about
the sensing matrix $\mathcal{A}(\boldsymbol{d})$ is known and where
$\mathcal{A}(\boldsymbol{d})$ linearly depends on $\boldsymbol{d}$. The goal is
to estimate the calibration parameter $\boldsymbol{d}$ (resolve the uncertainty
in the sensing process) and the signal/object of interests $\boldsymbol{x}$
simultaneously. For three different models of practical relevance, we show how
such a \emph{bilinear} inverse problem, including blind deconvolution as an
important example, can be solved via a simple \emph{linear least squares}
approach. As a consequence, the proposed algorithms are numerically extremely
efficient, thus potentially allowing for real-time deployment. We also present
a variation of the least squares approach, which leads to a~\emph{spectral
method}, where the solution to the bilinear inverse problem can be found by
computing the singular vector associated with the smallest singular value of a
certain matrix derived from the bilinear system. Explicit theoretical
guarantees and stability theory are derived for both techniques; and the number
of sampling complexity is nearly optimal (up to a poly-log factor).
Applications in imaging sciences and signal processing are discussed and
numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and

test point such that it is more likely to have a desired classification, has
previously been addressed using data from a single static point in time. Such
an approach yields inflated probability estimates, stemming from an implicitly
made assumption that recommendations are implemented instantaneously. We
propose using longitudinal data to alleviate such issues in two ways. First, we
use past outcome probabilities as features in the present. Use of such past
probabilities ties historical behavior to the present, allowing for more
information to be taken into account when making initial probability estimates
and subsequently performing inverse classification. Secondly, following inverse
classification application, optimized instances' unchangeable features
(e.g.,~age) are updated using values from the next longitudinal time period.
Optimized test instance probabilities are then reassessed. Updating the
unchangeable features in this manner reflects the notion that improvements in
outcome likelihood, which result from following the inverse classification
recommendations, do not materialize instantaneously. As our experiments
demonstrate, more realistic estimates of probability can be obtained by
factoring in such considerations.

reaching record spin polarizations (100\%). Furthermore, the recent observation
of the amplification of the spin filtering effect under a Faraday configuration
magnetic field has suggested that the hyperfine interaction that couples bound
electrons and nuclei permits the optical manipulation of its nuclear spin
polarization. Even though the mechanisms behind the nuclear spin polarization
in gallium centers are fairly well understood, the origin of nuclear spin
relaxation and the formation of an Overhauser-like magnetic field remain
elusive. In this work we develop a model based on the master equation approach
to describe the evolution of electronic and nuclear spin polarizations of
gallium centers interacting with free electrons and holes. Our results are in
good agreement with existing experimental observations. In regard to the
nuclear spin relaxation, the roles of nuclear dipolar and quadrupolar

RL to real-world robotic tasks has proven challenging, particularly in
safety-critical domains such as autonomous flight, where a trial-and-error
learning process is often impractical. In this paper, we explore the following
question: can we train vision-based navigation policies entirely in simulation,
and then transfer them into the real world to achieve real-world flight without
a single real training image? We propose a learning method that we call
CAD$^2$RL, which can be used to perform collision-free indoor flight in the
real world while being trained entirely on 3D CAD models. Our method uses
single RGB images from a monocular camera, without needing to explicitly
reconstruct the 3D geometry of the environment or perform explicit motion
planning. Our learned collision avoidance policy is represented by a deep
convolutional neural network that directly processes raw monocular images and
outputs velocity commands. This policy is trained entirely on simulated images,
with a Monte Carlo policy evaluation algorithm that directly optimizes the
network's ability to produce collision-free flight. By highly randomizing the
rendering settings for our simulated training set, we show that we can train a
policy that generalizes to the real world, without requiring the simulator to
be particularly realistic or high-fidelity. We evaluate our method by flying a
real quadrotor through indoor environments, and further evaluate the design
choices in our simulator through a series of ablation studies on depth
prediction. For supplementary video see: https://youtu.be/nXBWmzFrj5s

binary-input memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels $\left\{W_i\right\}_{i=1}^{N}$
is considered. The sequence of channels is assumed to be completely known to
both the transmitter and the receiver (a coherent scenario). Also, at each code
block transmission, each of the channels is used only once. In other words, a
codeword of length $N$ is constructed and then the $i$-th encoded bit is
transmitted over $W_i$. The goal is to operate at a rate $R$ close to the
average of the symmetric capacities of $W_i$'s, denoted by $\overline{I}_N$. To
this end, we construct a polar coding scheme using Arikan's channel
polarization transform in combination with certain permutations at each
polarization level and certain skipped operations. In particular, given a
non-stationary sequence of BMS channels $\left\{W_i\right\}_{i=1}^{N}$ and
$P_e$, where $0 < P_e <1$, we construct a polar code of length $N$ and rate $R$
guaranteeing a block error probability of at most $P_e$ for transmission over
$\left\{W_i\right\}_{i=1}^{N}$ such that $$ N \leq
\frac{\kappa}{(\overline{I}_N - R)^{\mu}}, $$ where $\mu$ is a constant and
$\kappa$ is a constant depending on $P_e$ and $\mu$. We further show a
numerical upper bound on $\mu$ that is: $\mu \leq 7.34$ for non-stationary
binary erasure channels and $\mu \leq 8.54$ for general non-stationary BMS
channels. The encoding and decoding complexities of the constructed polar code
preserve $O(N \log N)$ complexity of Arikan's polar codes. In an asymptotic
sense, when coded bits are transmitted over a non-stationary sequence of BMS
channels $\left\{W_i\right\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$, our proposed scheme achieves the
average symmetric capacity $$ \overline{I}(\left\{W_i\right\}_{i=1}^{\infty})
:= \lim_{N\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N I(W_i), $$ assuming that

by the significantly larger length $l$ contemplated for the neutron propagation
region. To this end, we introduce a stochastic model of the residual magnetic
field within the propagation region which draws on features of magnetic
profiles measured during the last free neutron oscillation experiment
[conducted at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in the 1990's]. We average over
both fluctuations in the magnetic field sampled by neutrons, and representative
spectra of neutron speeds. We find that deviations from the quasi-free result
for the antineutron probability do not depend quadratically on $l$ (as a naive
perturbative estimate would suggest) but increase only linearly with $l$. As
regards the large spikes in the magnetic field which can be expected at, for
example, joints in the magnetic shielding of the propagation region (despite
compensating currents and magnetic idealization of the shield), we demonstrate
that their effect scales as $l/D^{3/2}$, where $D$ is the diameter of the
cylindrical magnetic shielding. Our arguments suggest that, provided the
dimensions of the propagation region are such that the ratio $l/D^{3/2}$ does
not exceed the value pertinent to the ILL experiment, and these spikes occur
close to either end of the propagation region, they can be neglected. We also
establish that any large magnetic field encountered after the propagation
region is exited will not diminish the probability for antineutron detection.
For the range of values of $l$ of most interest to the ESS experiment, it
should suffice to improve on the level of magnetic suppression achieved at the
ILL by a factor of two.

genomics studies, may exhibit dependencies among observations as well as among
variables. This gives rise to the challenging problem of analyzing unreplicated
high-dimensional data with unknown mean and dependence structures.
Matrix-variate approaches that impose various forms of (inverse) covariance
sparsity allow flexible dependence structures to be estimated, but cannot
directly be applied when the mean and covariance matrices are estimated
jointly. We present a practical method utilizing generalized least squares and
penalized (inverse) covariance estimation to address this challenge. We
establish consistency and obtain rates of convergence for estimating the mean
parameters and covariance matrices. The advantages of our approaches are: (i)
dependence graphs and covariance structures can be estimated in the presence of
unknown mean structure, (ii) the mean structure becomes more efficiently
estimated when accounting for the dependence structure among observations; and
(iii) inferences about the mean parameters become correctly calibrated. We use
simulation studies and analysis of genomic data from a twin study of ulcerative
colitis to illustrate the statistical convergence and the performance of our
methods in practical settings. Several lines of evidence show that the test
statistics for differential gene expression produced by our methods are
correctly calibrated and improve power over conventional methods.

attention in visual object tracking community. The success of DCF is
potentially attributed to the fact that a large amount of samples are utilized
to train the ridge regression model and predict the location of object. To
solve the regression problem in an efficient way, these samples are all
generated by circularly shifting from a search patch. However, these synthetic
samples also induce some negative effects which weaken the robustness of DCF
based trackers.
  In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Regression framework for visual
tracking (CRT). Instead of learning the linear regression model in a closed
form, we try to solve the regression problem by optimizing a one-channel-output
convolution layer with Gradient Descent (GD). In particular, the receptive
field size of the convolution layer is set to the size of object. Contrary to
DCF, it is possible to incorporate all ""real"" samples clipped from the whole
image. A critical issue of the GD approach is that most of the convolutional
samples are negative and the contribution of positive samples will be
suppressed. To address this problem, we propose a novel Automatic Hard Negative
Mining method to eliminate easy negatives and enhance positives. Extensive
experiments are conducted on a widely-used benchmark with 100 sequences. The
results show that the proposed algorithm achieves outstanding performance and
outperforms almost all the existing DCF based algorithms.

Instead, we propose an estimator that directly fits the underlying preference

proposed estimator makes no generative assumption on the numerical scores of
the observations. One consequence is that the proposed estimator can fit any
consistent partial ranking over a subset of the items represented as a directed

preference scores. Despite this generality, for supervision representing total

the substratum stiffness is a key control parameter behind the formation of

artificial neural network should be able to easily express the identity

\emph{residual networks}.
  In this work, we put the principle of \emph{identity parameterization} on a
more solid theoretical footing alongside further empirical progress. We first
give a strikingly simple proof that arbitrarily deep linear residual networks
have no spurious local optima. The same result for linear feed-forward networks
in their standard parameterization is substantially more delicate. Second, we
show that residual networks with ReLu activations have universal finite-sample
expressivity in the sense that the network can represent any function of its
sample provided that the model has more parameters than the sample size.
  Directly inspired by our theory, we experiment with a radically simple
residual architecture consisting of only residual convolutional layers and ReLu
activations, but no batch normalization, dropout, or max pool. Our model
improves significantly on previous all-convolutional networks on the CIFAR10,

over the translation of the shock center for the time period of interest. Our

predicts sunspot emergence when Mercury and Earth approach conjunction and
Mercury approaches the Sun. We show that the reported times of flare activity
are coherent with the planetary model. While the base period of the model is
170 days, the average model period, over the interval of flare recordings, is
157 days due to a 180 degree phase change in the planetary forcing near the
middle of the record interval. We conclude that the periodicity at 154 days
arises when the phase change in planetary forcing and the resulting progressive
phase change in total sunspot area emergence and flare occurrence shifts the
major peak in the flare spectrum from the planetary forcing period, 170 days,
to 154 days.

scattering from a generic inhomogeneous medium. It is shown that if there is a
right corner on the support of the medium, then it scatters every pair of
incident EM fields, excluding a possible class of EM fields which are of very
particular forms. That is, for every pair of admissible incident EM fields, the
corresponding scattered wave fields associated to the medium scatterer cannot
be identically vanishing outside the support of the medium. Indeed, we achieve
the corner scattering result by establishing a stronger result, that shows the
failure of the analytic extension across the corner of certain EM fields
satisfying the so-called interior transmission eigenvalue problem. This extends
the relevant study in [3] for the acoustic scattering governed by the Helmholtz
equation to the electromagnetic case governed by the Maxwell system.
Substantial new challenges arise from the corresponding extension from the
scalar PDE to the system of PDEs. Our mathematical arguments combine the
analysis for interior transmission eigenvalue problems associated to the
Maxwell system; the derivation of novel orthogonality relation for the
solutions of Maxwell systems; the construction of complex-geometrical-optics
(CGO) solutions for the Maxwell system with new Lp-estimates (p > 6) on the
remainder terms; and the proof of the non-vanishing property for the Laplace
transform of vectorial homogeneous harmonic polynomials.

CNN models (4 networks x 5 data input types) and verified the performance of
each network with test images from five different databases. The experiment

a bulk band gap like ordinary band insulator but have protected conducting
states on their edge or surface. These states emerge out due to the combination
of spin-orbit coupling and time reversal symmetry. Also these states are
insensitive to scattering by non-magnetic impurities. A two-dimensional (2D)
topological insulator has one dimensional (1D) edge states in which the
spin-momentum locking of the electrons gives rise to quantum spin Hall effect.
A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D
Dirac fermions on its surface. These topological insulator materials have been
theoretically predicted and experimentally observed in a variety of 2D and 3D
systems, including $\rm HgTe$ quantum wells, $\rm BiSb$ alloys, and $\rm
Bi_{2}Te_{3}$, $\rm Bi_{2}Se_{3}$ crystals. Moreover, proximity induced
superconductivity in these systems can lead to a state that supports zero
energy Majorana fermion and the phase is known as topological superconductors.
In this article, the basic idea of topological insulators and topological
superconductors are presented along with their experimental development.

fusion center for it to infer a public hypothesis of interest. However, the
same sensor information may be used by the fusion center to make inferences of
a private nature that the sensors wish to protect. To model this, we adopt a
decentralized hypothesis testing framework with binary public and private
hypotheses. Each sensor makes a private observation and utilizes a local sensor
decision rule or privacy mapping to summarize that observation independently of
the other sensors. The local decision made by a sensor is then sent to the
fusion center. Without assuming knowledge of the joint distribution of the
sensor observations and hypotheses, we adopt a nonparametric learning approach
to design local privacy mappings. We introduce the concept of an empirical
normalized risk, which provides a theoretical guarantee for the network to
achieve information privacy for the private hypothesis with high probability
when the number of training samples is large. We develop iterative optimization
algorithms to determine an appropriate privacy threshold and the best sensor
privacy mappings, and show that they converge. Finally, we extend our approach
to the case of a private multiple hypothesis. Numerical results on both
synthetic and real data sets suggest that our proposed approach yields low
error rates for inferring the public hypothesis, but high error rates for
detecting the private hypothesis.

Theoretically, the cost of LP is invariant to $P$, where $P$ is the number of
GPUs, while the cost of more conventional Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) scales
like $O(\log P)$. LP also demonstrate up to 2x faster bandwidth than
Bidirectional Exchange (BE) techniques that are widely adopted by current MPI
implementations. We apply these collectives to BSP-SGD, showing that the
proposed implementations reduce communication bottlenecks in practice while
preserving the attractive convergence properties of BSP-SGD.

has been applied to biomolecular systems. In this context, the notion of a
Faraday-equivalent chemical potential is introduced which allows chemical
potential to be expressed in an analogous manner to electrical volts thus
allowing engineering intuition to be applied to biomolecular systems. Redox
reactions, and their representation by half-reactions, are key components of
biological systems which involve both electrical and chemical domains. A bond
graph interpretation of redox reactions is given which combines bond graphs
with the Faraday- equivalent chemical potential. This approach is particularly
relevant when the biomolecular system implements chemoelectrical transduction -
for example chemiosmosis within the key metabolic pathway of mitochondria:
oxidative phosphorylation. An alternative way of implementing computational
modularity using bond graphs is introduced and used to give a physically based
model of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. To illustrate the overall
approach, this model is analysed using the Faraday-equivalent chemical
potential approach and engineering intuition is used to guide affinity
equalisation: a energy based analysis of the mitochondrial electron transport
chain.

bird. It sneakily replaces some of the eggs of other species with its own. Lest
the Cuckoo extinct itself by destroying its host, it self-limits its power: It
does not replace too large a fraction of the eggs. Here, we show that any
Byzantine Behavior that does not destroy the system it attacks, i.e. allows the
system to solve an easy task like epsilon-agreement, then its maliciousness can
be confined to be the exact replica of the Cuckoo bird behavior: Undetectably
replace an input of a processor and let the processor behave correctly
thereafter with respect to the new input. In doing so we reduce the study of
Byzantine behavior to fail-stop (benign) behavior with the Cuckoo caveat of a
fraction of the inputs replaced. We establish a complete correspondence between
the Byzantine and the Benign, modulo different thresholds, and replaced inputs.
This work is yet another step in a line of work unifying seemingly distinct
distributed system models, dispelling the Myth that Distributed Computing is a
plethora of distinct isolated models, each requiring its specialized tools and
ideas in order to determine solvability of tasks. Thus, hereafter, Byzantine
Computability questions can be reduced to questions in the benign failure
setting. We also show that the known results about correlated faults in the
asynchronous benign setting can be imported verbatim to the asynchronous
Byzantine setting. Finally, as in the benign case in which we have the property
that a processor can output once its faulty behavior stops for long enough, we
show this can be done in a similar manner in the Byzantine case. This
necessitated the generalization of Reliable Broadcast to what we term
Recoverable Reliable Broadcast.

the coexistence of high mobility electron and hole carriers that have almost

axisymmetric spacetimes. Like area~(or entropy) product of multihorizons, the
mass-independent~(universal) feature of volume products are sometimes also
\emph{fail}. In particular for a spherically symmetric AdS spacetimes the
simple thermodynamic volume product of ${\cal H}^{\pm}$ is not
mass-independent. In this case, more complicated combinations of outer and
inner horizon volume products are indeed mass-independent. For a particular
class of spherically symmetric cases i.e. Reissner Nordstr\""om BH of Einstein
gravity and Kehagias-Sfetsos BH of Ho\v{r}ava Lifshitz gravity, the
thermodynamic volume products of ${\cal H}^{\pm}$ is indeed \emph{universal}.
For axisymmetric class of BH spacetime in Einstein gravity all the combinations
are \emph{mass-dependent}. There has been no chance to formulate any
combinations of volume product relation is to be mass-independent.
Interestingly, \emph{only the rotating BTZ black hole} in 3D provides the
volume product formula is mass-independent i.e. \emph{universal} and hence it
is quantized.

the state is considered, where the corresponding Lagrange multipliers in
general only represent regular Borel measure functions. To tackle this
difficulty, the Lavrentiev regularization is employed to deal with the state
constraints. To numerically discretize the resulted problem, since the weakness
of variational discretization in numerical implementation, full piecewise
linear finite element discretization is employed. Estimation of the error
produced by regularization and discretization is done. The error order of full
discretization is not inferior to that of variational discretization because of
the Lavrentiev-regularization. Taking the discretization error into account,
algorithms of high precision do not make much sense. Utilizing efficient
first-order algorithms to solve discretized problems to moderate accuracy is
sufficient. Then a heterogeneous alternating direction method of multipliers
(hADMM) is proposed. Different from the classical ADMM, our hADMM adopts two
different weighted norms in two subproblems respectively. Additionally, to get
more accurate solution, a two-phase strategy is presented, in which the
primal-dual active set (PDAS) method is used as a postprocessor of the hADMM.
Numerical results not only verify error estimates but also show the efficiency
of the hADMM and the two-phase strategy.

($V_\mathrm{oc}$) suffers from an ultra-high loss at low temperatures. In this
work we investigate the origin of the loss through calculating the
$V_\mathrm{oc}-T$ plots with the device model method systematically and
comparing it with experimentally observed ones. When the energetic disorder is
incorporated into the model by considering the disorder-suppressed and
temperature-dependent charge carrier mobilities, it is found that for
nonselective contacts the $V_\mathrm{oc}$ reduces drastically under the low
temperature regime, while for selective contacts the $V_\mathrm{oc}$ keeps
increasing with the decreasing temperature. The main reason is revealed that as
the temperature decreases, the reduced mobilities give rise to low charge
extraction efficiency and small bimolecular recombination rate for the
photogenerated charge carriers, so that in the former case they can be
extracted from the wrong electrode to form a leakage current which counteracts
the photocurrent and increases quickly with voltage, leading to the anomalous
reduction of $V_\mathrm{oc}$. In addition, it is revealed that the charge
generation rate is slow-varying with temperature and does not induce
significant $V_\mathrm{oc}$ loss. This work also provides a comprehensive
picture for the $V_\mathrm{oc}$ behavior under varying device working
conditions.

Hubbard model. A time-periodic laser field $\vec{A}(t)$ lifts the SC-CDW
degeneracy, since the CDW couples linearly to the field ($\vec{A}$), whereas SC
couples in second order ($\vec{A}^2$) due to gauge invariance. This leads to a
striking resonance: When the photon energy is red-detuned compared to the
equilibrium single-particle energy gap, CDW is enhanced and SC is suppressed,
while this behavior is reversed for blue detuning. Both orders oscillate with
an emergent slow frequency, which is controlled by the small amplitude of a
third induced order, namely $\eta$ pairing, given by the commutator of the two
primary orders. The induced $\eta$ pairing is shown to control the enhancement
and suppression of the dominant orders. Finally, we demonstrate that
light-induced superconductivity is possible starting from a predominantly CDW

increasing size of the underlying data renders both graph storage and query

the size of deterministic graphs by maintaining only the important edges.
However, adaptation of deterministic sparsification methods fails in the

The resulting graph can be used to efficiently and accurately approximate any

in economics, that has become increasingly interdisciplinary in the currently
troubled economic situation. In particular, much attention has been devoted to
the interbank lending market as an important diffusion channel for financial
distress during the recent crisis. In this work we study the stability of the
interbank market to exogenous shocks using an agent-based network framework.
Our model encompasses several ingredients that have been recognized in the
literature as pro-cyclical triggers of financial distress in the banking
system: credit and liquidity shocks through bilateral exposures, liquidity
hoarding due to counterparty creditworthiness deterioration, target leveraging
policies and fire-sales spillovers. But we exclude the possibility of central
authorities intervention. We implement this framework on a dataset of 183
European banks that were publicly traded between 2004 and 2013. We document the
extreme fragility of the interbank lending market up to 2008, when a systemic
crisis leads to total depletion of market equity with an increasing speed of
market collapse. After the crisis instead the system is more resilient to
systemic events in terms of residual market equity. However, the speed at which
the crisis breaks out reaches a new maximum in 2011, and never goes back to
values observed before 2007. Our analysis points to the key role of the crisis
outbreak speed, which sets the maximum delay for central authorities
intervention to be effective.

diffusion is slowed down as it interacts with impurities. By changing the

concentrations, the diffusivity of hydrogen can be changed by several orders of
magnitude. In this study the influence of the hydrogen concentration on the
temperature dependence of the diffusion in high energy proton implanted silicon

temperature dependence decrease with increasing hydrogen concentration. We
propose a model where the relevant defects that mediate hydrogen diffusion
become saturated with hydrogen at high concentrations. When the defects that
provide hydrogen with the lowest energy positions in the lattice are saturated,
hydrogen resides at energetically less favorable positions and this increases
the diffusion of hydrogen through the crystal. Furthermore, we present a survey
of different studies on the diffusion of hydrogen. We observed a correlation of
the Arrhenius parameters calculated in those studies, leading to a modification
of the Arrhenius equation for the diffusion of hydrogen in silicon.

simplest formulation of the problem is when the climber falls from a given

is attached to the rock at a given height. The problem is then finding the
properties of the rope for which the peak force felt by the climber during the
fall is minimal. The second problem of our consideration is again minimizing
the same quantity in the presence of a carabiner. We will call such ropes
\textit{mathematically ideal.} Given the height of the carabiner, the initial
height and the mass of the climber, the length of the unstretched rope, and the
distance between the belayer and the carabineer, we find the optimal (in the
sense of minimized the peak force to a given elongation) dynamic rope in the
framework of nonlinear elasticity. Wires of shape memory materials have some of
the desired features of the tension-strain relation of a mathematically ideal
dynamic rope, namely a plateau in the tension over a range of strains. With a
suitable hysteresis loop, they also absorb essentially all the energy from the
fall, thus making them an ideal rope in this sense too.

asteroseismology and study diagnostics of stellar evolution, such as variation
of magnetic activity, rotation and the surface lithium abundance. In this

lithium abundance and oscillations in a group of 18 solar-analogue stars
through space photometry, obtained with the NASA Kepler space telescope and
from currently 50+ hours of ground-based, high-resolution spectroscopy with the
Hermes instrument. In these proceedings, we first discuss the selection of the
stars in the sample, observations and calibrations and then summarise the main
results of the project. By investigating the chromospheric and photospheric
activity of the solar analogues in this sample, it was shown that for a large
fraction of these stars the measured activity levels are compatible to levels
of the 11-year solar activity cycle 23. A clear correlation between the lithium
abundance and surface rotation was found for rotation periods shorter than the
solar value. Comparing the lithium abundance measured in the solar analogues to
evolutionary models with the Toulouse-Geneva Evolutionary Code (TGEC), we found
that the solar models calibrated to the Sun also correctly describe the set of
solar/stellar analogs showing that they share the same internal mixing physics.
Finally, the star KIC 3241581 and KIC 10644353 are discussed in more detail.

structure at high altitudes. The analyzed CME had a core with a spiral-flux
rope-structure. The spiral shape indicates that the flux rope radius varied
along its length. The flux rope had a complex temperature structure: cold legs
(70 000 K, observed in He 304 \AA\ line) and a hotter core (0.7 MK, observed in
Fe 171 \AA\ line). Such structure contradicts the common assumption that the
CME core is a cold prominence. When the CME impulsively accelerated, a dark
double Y-structure appeared below the flux rope. The Y-structure timing,
location, and morphology agree with the previously performed MHD simulations of
the current sheet. We interpreted the Y-structure as a hot envelope of the
current sheet and hot reconnection outflows. The Y-structure had a thickness
6.0 Mm. Its length increased over time from 79 Mm to more than 411 Mm.

exploiting the low-rank and structured Hankel matrix of impulse response. This

gray-box parameterized ones. This overcomes a persistent shortcoming in a
number of recent contributions on this topic, and the new method can be applied
for the structured state-space realization even if the involved system
parameters are unidentifiable. The method can be used both for directly
estimating the gray-box parameters and for providing initial parameter

Probabilistic methods are essential to understand the functional role of this

most common model of trial-to-trial variability. For a Poisson process, the
variance of the spike count is constrained to be equal to the mean,
irrespective of the duration of measurements. Numerous studies have shown that
this relationship does not generally hold. Specifically, a majority of
electrophysiological recordings show an "" over-dispersion "" effect: Responses
that exhibit more inter-trial variability than expected from a Poisson process
alone. A model that is particularly well suited to quantify over-dispersion is
the Negative-Binomial distribution model. This model is well-studied and widely
used but has only recently been applied to neuroscience. In this paper, we
address three main issues. First, we describe how the Negative-Binomial
distribution provides a model apt to account for overdispersed spike counts.
Second, we quantify the significance of this model for any neurophysiological
data by proposing a statistical test, which quantifies the odds that
over-dispersion could be due to the limited number of repetitions (trials). We
apply this test to three neurophysiological tests along the visual pathway.
Finally, we compare the performance of this model to the Poisson model on a
population decoding task. We show that the decoding accuracy is improved when
accounting for over-dispersion, especially under the hypothesis of tuned
over-dispersion.

  Cyber-Physical Systems",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Energy constraint long-range wireless sensor/ actuator based solutions are
theoretically the perfect choice to support the next generation of city-scale
cyber-physical systems. Traditional systems adopt periodic control which
increases network congestion and actuations while burdens the energy
consumption. Recent control theory studies overcome these problems by
introducing aperiodic strategies, such as event trigger control. In spite of
the potential savings, these strategies assume actuator continuous listening
while ignoring the sensing energy costs. In this paper, we fill this gap, by
enabling sensing and actuator listening duty-cycling and proposing two
innovative MAC protocols for three decentralized event trigger control
approaches. A laboratory experimental testbed, which emulates a smart water
network, was modelled and extended to evaluate the impact of system parameters
and the performance of each approach. Experimental results reveal the
predominance of the decentralized event-triggered control against the classic
periodic control either in terms of communication or actuation by promising
significant system lifetime extension.

unprecedented insight into silicon aging mechanisms in full cell configuration.
We observe the morphology of the SEI to be extremely heterogeneous at the
particle scale but with clear chemical evolutions with extended cycling coming
from both SEI accumulation and a transition from lithium-rich carbonate-like
compounds to lithium-poor ones. Thanks to the retrieval of several results from
a single dataset, we were able to correlate local discrepancies in lithiation
to the initial crystallinity of silicon as well as to the local SEI chemistry

first-principles calculations to explore the origin of enhanced photocatalytic
performance of CeO2 doped with transition metal impurities (Fe, Cr and Co).
When a transition metal atom substitutes a Ce atom into CeO2, t2g and eg levels
of 3d orbits appear in the middle of band gap owing to the effect of cubic
ligand field, and the former is higher than latter. Interestingly, t2g subset
of FeCe (CoCe and CrCe)-Vo-CeO2 is split into two parts: one merges into the
conduction band, the other as well as eg will remain in the gap, because O
vacancy defect adjacent to transition metal atom will break the symmetry of
cubic ligand field. These eg and t2g levels in the band gap are beneficial for
absorbing visible light and enhancing quantum efficiency because of forbidden
transition, which is one key factor for enhanced visible light photocatalytic
activity. The band gap narrowing also leads to a redshift of optical absorbance
and high photoactivity. These findings can rationalize the available
experimental results and provide some new insights for designing CeO2-based
photocatalysts with high photocatalytic performance.

bilayer using (i) a low-energy effective Hamiltonian for the underlying
electronic structure, (ii) an isotropic elastic phonon model, and (iii) the
linear Boltzmann equation for elastic electron-phonon scattering. We find that
transport in the twist bilayer is profoundly sensitive to the rotation angle of
the constituent layers. Similar to the electronic structure of the twist
bilayer the transport is qualitatively different in three distinct angle
regimes. At large angles ($\theta > \,\approx\!\!10^\circ$) and at temperatures
below an interlayer Bloch-Gr\""uneisen temperature of $\approx 10$~K the
conductivity is independent of the twist angle i.e. the layers are fully
decoupled. Above this temperature the layers, even though decoupled in the
ground state, are re-coupled by electron-phonon scattering and the transport is
different both from single layer graphene as well as the Bernal bilayer. In the
small angle regime $\theta <\,\approx\!\!2^\circ$ the conductivity drops by two
orders of magnitude and develops a rich energy dependence, reflecting the
complexity of the underlying topological changes (Lifshitz transitions) of the
Fermi surface. At intermediate angles the conductivity decreases continuously
as the twist angle is reduced, while the energy dependence of the conductivity
presents two sharp transitions, that occur at specific angle dependent
energies, and that may be related to (i) the well studied van Hove singularity
of the twist bilayer and (ii) a Lifshitz transition that occurs when trigonally
placed electron pockets decorate the strongly warped Dirac cone. We examine the
role of a layer perpendicular electric field finding that it affects the
conductivity strongly at low temperatures whereas this effect is washed out by
Fermi smearing at room temperatures.

efficiently if nodes, or agents, actively forward information based on hidden

forward messages, which has a cost, and navigation is impossible. Can we design
appropriate incentives that lead to participation and global navigability?
Here, we present an evolutionary game where agents share the value generated by
successful delivery of information or goods. We show that global navigability
can emerge, but its complete breakdown is possible as well. Furthermore, we
show that the system tends to self-organize into local clusters of agents who

investigate X-ray time lags in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This model
consists of two axial point sources illuminating an accretion disc that produce
the reverberation lags. These lags are due to the time delays between the
directly observed and reflection photons and are associated with the
light-travel time between the source and the disc, so they allow us to probe
the disc-corona geometry. We assume the variations of two X-ray sources are
triggered by the same primary variations, but allow the two sources to respond
in different ways (i.e. having different source responses). The variations of
each source induce a delayed accretion disc response and the total lags consist
of a combination of both source and disc responses. We show that the extended
corona model can reproduce both the low-frequency hard and high-frequency soft
(reverberation) lags. Fitting the model to the timing data of PG~1244+026
reveals the hard and soft X-ray sources at $\sim6r_{\text{g}}$ and
$\sim11r_{\text{g}}$, respectively. The upper source produces small amounts of
reflection and can be interpreted as a relativistic jet, or outflowing blob,
whose emission is beamed away from the disc. This explains the observed
lag-energy in which there is no soft lag at energies $<1$~keV as they are
diluted by the soft continuum of the upper source. Finally, our models suggest
that the fluctuations propagating between the two sources of PG~1244+026 are
possible but only at near the speed of light.

structure in the outburst tail. Power spectral densities and phase lags show a
complex evolution, revealing the presence of intrinsically connected optical
and X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations. For the first time, we quantitatively
explain the evolution of these timing properties during the entire outburst
within one model, the essence of which is the expansion of the hot accretion
flow towards the tail of the outburst. The pivoting of the spectrum produced by
synchrotron Comptonization in the hot flow is responsible for the appearance of
the anti-correlation with the X-rays and for the optical quasi-periodic
oscillations. Our model reproduces well the cross-correlation and phase lag
spectrum during the decline stage, which could not be understood with any model
proposed before.

These structures are investigated by means of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,

vibrating sample magnetometry. While the lattice mismatch of NiO grown on
MgO(001) is only 0.8%, it is exposed to a lateral lattice mismatch of -6.9% if
grown on SrTiO$_3$. In the case of Fe$_3$O$_4$, the misfit strain on MgO(001)
and SrTiO$_3$(001) amounts to 0.3% and -7.5%, respectively. To clarify the
relaxation process of the bilayer system, the film thicknesses of the magnetite
and nickel oxide films have been varied between 5 and 20nm. While NiO films are
well ordered on both substrates, Fe$_3$O$_4$ films grown on NiO/SrTiO$_3$
exhibit a higher surface roughness as well as lower structural ordering
compared to films grown on NiO/MgO. Further, NiO films grow pseudomorphic in
the investigated thickness range on MgO substrates without any indication of
relaxation, whereas on SrTiO$_3$ the NiO films show strong strain relaxation.
Fe$_3$O$_4$ films exhibit also strong relaxation even for films of 5nm

both substrates show a fourfold magnetic in-plane anisotropy with magnetic easy
axes pointing in $\left\langle100\right\rangle$ directions. The coercive field
is strongly enhanced for magnetite grown on NiO/SrTiO$_3$ due to higher density
of structural defects, compared to magnetite grown on NiO/MgO.

to communicate under water for several years, other technologies are being

Each technology has its own advantages and drawbacks: for example, acoustic
signals achieve long communication ranges at order-of-kbit/s bit rate, whereas
optical signals offer order-of-Mbit/s transmission rates but only over short
transmitter--receiver distances. Such a technological diversity can be
leveraged by multi-modal systems, which integrate different technologies and
provide intelligence to decide which one should be used at any given time. In
this paper, we address a fundamental part of this intelligence by proposing a
novel routing protocol for networks of multi-modal nodes. The protocol makes
distributed decisions about the flow in each link and over each technology at
any given time, in order to advance a packet towards its destination. Our
routing protocol prevents bottlenecks and allocates resources fairly to

in a field experiment. The results show that our protocol successfully
leverages all technologies to deliver data, even in the presence of imperfect

case-control status and genetic variants. In addition to this primary phenotype
a number of additional traits, known as secondary phenotypes, are routinely
recorded and typically associations between genetic factors and these secondary
traits are studied too. Analysing secondary phenotypes in case-control studies
may lead to biased genetic effect estimates, especially when the marker tested
is associated with the primary phenotype and when the primary and secondary
phenotypes tested are correlated. Several methods have been proposed in the
literature to overcome the problem but they are limited to case-control studies
and not directly applicable to more complex designs, such as the multiple-cases
family studies. A proper secondary phenotype analysis, in this case, is
complicated by the within families correlations on top of the biased sampling
design. We propose a novel approach to accommodate the ascertainment process
while explicitly modelling the familial relationships. Our approach pairs
existing methods for mixed-effects models with the retrospective likelihood
framework and uses a multivariate probit model to capture the association
between the mixed type primary and secondary phenotypes. To examine the
efficiency and bias of the estimates we performed simulations under several
scenarios for the association between the primary phenotype, secondary
phenotype, and genetic markers. We will illustrate the method by analysing the
association between triglyceride levels and glucose (secondary phenotypes) and
genetic markers from the Leiden Longevity study, a multiple-cases family study

a full-duplex capability cannot always reduce the band occupancy because the

to arrive at an opposite node is expected to reduce the band occupancy. In this

under traffic that is not fully buffered based on queueing theory, as well as
the closed-form results. We also present the results of simulations of band

shows how the mean waiting time and band occupancy are affected by the
buffering time. When the buffering time is half the packet length, the band
occupancy is reduced by approximately 15 %. In addition, under asymmetrical
traffic, the results suggest that the buffering time should not be set at the

sufficiently small times we prove convergence of the solutions of the
Stokes/Allen-Cahn system to solutions of a sharp interface model, where the
interface evolution is given by the mean curvature equation with an additional
convection term coupled to a two-phase Stokes system with an additional
contribution to the stress tensor, which describes the capillary stress. To
this end we construct a suitable approximation of the solution of the
Stokes/Allen-Cahn system, using three levels of the terms in the formally
matched asymptotic calculations, and estimate the difference with the aid of a
suitable refinement of a spectral estimate of the linearized Allen-Cahn
operator. Moreover, a careful treatment of the coupling terms is needed.

for its strong adaptability and long history of cultivation. However, seldom
has any research touched on its physiological resistance mechanism. In this
experiment, the impatiens is selected from those which experienced aerospace
mutation and thereafter 12 years of cultivation and breeding. Therefore, it is
superior to the non-mutagenized impatiens in terms of drought resistance and
demonstrates tremendous differences from the normal impatiens in physiology,
which intrigues scholars to search for the underlying reasons . Methods: By
reference to Impatiens balsamina L,this experiment uses mutagenized impatiens
seeds, processed by PEG-6000 in different solution concentration, to measure
the germination rate of impatiens, its relative enzymatic activity and
expression differences between gene SoS2 and gene RD29b in the drought lower
reaches. Key results: Under simulated drought stress, there is no distinct
difference between the mutagenized impatiens and the normal impatiens in terms
of germination rate. But by measuring the root tillers and the length, the
relative enzymatic activity, MDA, and the expression differences between gene
SoS2 and gene RD29b in the drought lower reaches, it is verified that the
mutagenized impatiens has more advantages than the normal impatiens, and it Can
further cultivate become drought resistance varieties impatiens. Conclusions:
In this experiment,which is a positive mutation, the mutagenized impatiens
improves drought resistance through radiative mutation. The so obtained
impatiens is more pleasing in sight in terms of color and shape and has higher
application value in garden virescence.

generalized-frequency-division-multiplexing (GFDM) transmitter matrices is
proposed, as opposed to traditional vector-based characterization with
prototype filters. The characterization facilitates deriving properties of GFDM
(transmitter) matrices, including conditions for GFDM matrices being
nonsingular and unitary, respectively. Using the new characterization, the
necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a form of
low-complexity implementation for a minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver
are derived. Such an implementation exists under multipath channels if the GFDM
transmitter matrix is selected to be unitary. For cases where this
implementation does not exist, a low-complexity suboptimal MMSE receiver is
proposed, with its performance approximating that of an MMSE receiver. The new
characterization also enables derivations of optimal prototype filters in terms
of minimizing receiver mean square error (MSE). They are found to correspond to
the use of unitary GFDM matrices under many scenarios. The use of such optimal
filters in GFDM systems does not cause the problem of noise enhancement,
thereby demonstrating the same MSE performance as orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing. Moreover, we find that GFDM matrices with a size of power of two
are verified to exist in the class of unitary GFDM matrices. Finally, while the
out-of-band (OOB) radiation performance of systems using a unitary GFDM matrix
is not optimal in general, it is shown that the OOB radiation can be
satisfactorily low if parameters in the new characterization are carefully
chosen.

strengths are also calculated, with the DARC code, and listed for resonance
transitions over a wide energy range, up to 30~Ryd. No similar results are

the more important parameter, effective collision strength ($\Upsilon$), for

have been resolved in a narrow energy mesh, although these are not observed to

increase with increasing temperature and worsen as the upper level J increases.

  1. It is proved that that the class of lower (Skolem) elementary functions is
the set of all polynomial-bounded functions that can be obtained by a
composition of $x+1$, $xy$, $\max(x-y,0)$, $x\wedge y$, $\lfloor x/y \rfloor$,
and one exponential function ($2^x$ or $x^y$) using formulas that have no more
than 2 floors with respect to an exponent (for example, $(x+y)^{xy+z}+1$ has 2
floors, $2^{2^x}$ has 3 floors). Here $x\wedge y$ is a bitwise AND of $x$ and
$y$.
  2. It is proved that $\{x+y,\ \max(x-y,0),\ x\wedge y,\ \lfloor x/y \rfloor,\
2^{\lfloor \log_2 x \rfloor^2}\}$ and $\{x+y,\ \max(x-y,0),\ x\wedge y,\
\lfloor x/y \rfloor,\ x^{\lfloor \log_2 y \rfloor}\}$ are composition bases in
the functional version of the uniform $\mathrm{TC}^0$ (also known as
$\mathrm{FOM}$).
  3. The hierarchy of classes exhausting the class of elementary functions is
described in terms of compositions with restrictions on a number of floors in a
formula.

cars) to detect and broadcast available parking spaces when driving through
parking lots. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of market penetration of
probe cars on the system performance, and investigate different parking
guidance policies to improve the data acquisition process. We adopt a
simulation-based approach to impose four policies on an off- street parking lot
influencing the behavior of probe cars to park in assigned parking spaces. This
in turn effects the scanning route and the parking space occupancy estimations.
The last policy we propose is a near-optimal guidance strategy that maximizes
the information gain of posteriors. The results suggest that an efficient
information gathering policy can compensate for low penetration of connected
and automated vehicles. We also highlight the policy trade-off that occur while
attempting to maximize information gain through explorations and improve
assignment accuracy through exploitations. Our results can assist urban policy

much speculation that the non-monotonic behavior of $\kappa\sigma^{2}$ of the

be due to the existence of QCD critical point. However, the experimentally
measured proton distributions contain protons from heavy resonance decays, from
baryon stopping and from direct production processes. These proton
distributions are used to estimate the net-proton number fluctuation. Because
it is difficult to disentangle the protons from the above-mentioned sources, it
is better to devise a method which will account for the directly produced
baryons (protons) to study the dynamical fluctuation at different
center-of-mass energies. This is because, it is assumed that any associated
criticality in the system could affect the particle production mechanism and
hence the dynamical fluctuation in various conserved numbers. In the present

field $E$ is studied by using the gauge/gravity correspondence. The pair
breaking current induced by $E$ first increases to a peak value and then
decreases to a constant value at late time, where the superconducting gap goes
to zero, corresponding to a normal conducting phase. The peak value of the
current is found to increase linearly with respect to the electric field.
Moreover, the nonlinear conductivity, defined as an average of the conductivity
in the superconducting phase, scales as $\sim E^{-2/3}$ for large $E$ when the
system is close to the critical temperature, which agrees with predictions from
solving the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation.

involving symbolic manipulation, Picard iteration, and auxiliary variables for
approximating solutions of partial differential boundary value problems. The
method is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and it is highly
accurate. The output of the method is a function that approximates the exact
solution.

solvable lattice models. Marginally large tableaux are semi-standard Young
tableaux of special form that give a realization of the crystals ${\cal
B}(\infty)$. We introduce cascading sequences to characterize marginally large
tableaux. Then we use cascading sequences and a non-explicit crystal
isomorphism between marginally large tableaux and rigged configurations to give
a characterization of the latter set, and to give an explicit bijection between
the two sets.

  Telematics",,,,,"cs.CR cs.CE cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a particle-based framework for estimating the position of a
vehicle using map information and measurements of speed. Two measurement
functions are considered. The first is based on the assumption that the lateral
force on the vehicle does not exceed critical limits derived from physical
constraints. The second is based on the assumption that the driver approaches a
target speed derived from the speed limits along the upcoming trajectory.
Performance evaluations of the proposed method indicate that end destinations
often can be estimated with an accuracy in the order of $100\,[m]$. These
results expose the sensitivity and commercial value of data collected in many
of today's insurance telematics programs, and thereby have privacy implications
for millions of policyholders. We end by discussing the strengths and
weaknesses of different methods for anonymization and privacy preservation in
telematics programs.
