possibly unstable collective mode are discussed. It is argued that a
zonostrophic instability (of homogeneous turbulence to the formation of zonal
flows) occurs just below the threshold for linear instability. The scenario
provides a new interpretation of the random forcing that is ubiquitously
invoked in stochastic models such as the second-order cumulant expansion (CE2)
or stochastic structural instability theory (SSST); neither intrinsic
turbulence nor coupling to extrinsic turbulence is required. A representative
calculation of the zonostrophic neutral curve is made for a simple two-field
model of toroidal ion-temperature-gradient-driven modes. To the extent that the
damping of zonal flows is controlled by the ion--ion collision rate, the point
of zonostrophic instability is independent of that rate.

who seek to optimize an objective function that takes into account their
location and the distribution of the remaining agents. Here, we consider
stationary MFGs with congestion and prove the existence of stationary
solutions. Because moving in congested areas is difficult, agents prefer to
move in non-congested areas. As a consequence, the model becomes singular near
the zero density. The existence of stationary solutions was previously obtained
for MFGs with quadratic Hamiltonians thanks to a very particular identity.
Here, we develop robust estimates that give the existence of a solution for

These results are proved using a stronger version of the \emph{$k$-universal

the stability and quality of electrical power grids. In particular short-term
fluctuations disturb the system on a time scale, on which load balancing does
not operate yet and the system is intrinsically governed by self-organized
synchronization. Wind and solar power are known to be strongly non-Gaussian
with intermittent increment statistics in these time scales. We investigate the
impact of short-term wind fluctuations on the basis of a Kuramoto-like power
grid model considering stability in terms of desynchronization and frequency
and voltage quality aspects. We compare intermittent feed-in with a realistic
power spectrum, correlated Gaussian noise of the same spectrum, and Gaussian
white noise. We found out that the likelihood of severe outages is mainly
determined by the temporal correlation of the feed-in. The intermittent nature
of wind power is transferred into frequency and voltage fluctuations. This
establishes a novel type of fluctuations with severe consequences on frequency
and voltage quality, which are beyond engineering status of knowledge.

stars (M to A-type stars). These systems are susceptible to be tidally
evolving, in particular the dissipation of the kinetic energy of tidal flows in
the host star may modify its rotational evolution and also shape the orbital
architecture of the surrounding planetary system. Recent theoretical studies
have shown that the amplitude of the stellar dissipation can vary over several
orders of magnitude as the star evolves, and that it also depends on the
stellar mass and rotation. We present here one of the first studies of the
dynamics of close-in planets orbiting low-mass stars (from $0.6~M_\odot$ to
$1.2~M_\odot$) where we compute the simultaneous evolution of the star's
structure, rotation and tidal dissipation in its external convective envelope.
We demonstrate that tidal friction due to the stellar dynamical tide, i.e.
tidal inertial waves (their restoring force is the Coriolis acceleration)
excited in the convection zone, can be larger by several orders of magnitude
than the one of the equilibrium tide currently used in celestial mechanics.
This is particularly true during the Pre Main Sequence (PMS) phase and to a
lesser extent during the Sub Giant (SG) phase. Numerical simulations show that
only the high dissipation occurring during the PMS phase has a visible effect
on the semi-major axis of close-in planets. We also investigate the effect of
the metallicity of the star on the tidal evolution of planets. We find that the
higher the metallicity of the star, the higher the dissipation and the larger
the tidally-induced migration of the planet.

frequently used to model aperiodic light curves of AGNs. A number of
correlations between the DRW model parameters, the signal decorrelation
timescale and amplitude, and the physical AGN parameters such as the black hole
mass or luminosity have been reported. Aims: We are interested in whether it is
plausible to correctly measure the DRW parameters from a typical ground-based
survey, in particular how accurate the recovered DRW parameters are compared to
the input ones. Methods: By means of Monte Carlo simulations of AGN light
curves, we study the impact of the light curve length, the source magnitude,
cadence, and additional light on the DRW model parameters. Results: The most
significant finding is that currently existing surveys are going to return
unconstrained DRW decorrelation timescales, because typical rest-frame data do
not probe long enough timescales or the white noise part of PSD for DRW. The
experiment length must be at least ten times longer than the true DRW
timescale, being presumably in the vicinity of one year, meaning a minimum
10-years-long AGN light curves (rest-frame). The DRW timescales for
sufficiently long light curves are typically weakly biased, and the exact bias
depends on the fitting method and used priors. The DRW amplitude is mostly
affected by the photometric noise (so the source magnitude or the
signal-to-noise ratio), cadence, and the AGN host light. Conclusions: Because
the DRW parameters appear to be incorrectly determined from typically existing
data, the reported correlations of the DRW variability and physical AGN
parameters from other works seem unlikely to be correct. In particular, the
anti-correlation of the DRW timescale with redshift is a manifestation of the
survey length being too short. Application of DRW to modeling typical AGN
optical light curves is questioned.

for developing parallel adaptive finite element programs, which is under active
development at the State Key Laboratory of Scientific and Engineering
Computing. The main results of this work are as follows.
  1) For the tetrahedral meshes used in PHG, under reasonable assumptions, we
proved the existence of through-vertex Hamiltonian paths between arbitrary two
vertices, as well as the existence of through-vertex Hamiltonian cycles, and
designed an efficient algorithm with linear complexity for constructing
through-vertex Hamiltonian paths. The resulting algorithm has been implemented
in PHG, and is used for ordering elements in the coarsest mesh for the
refinement tree mesh partitioning algorithm.
  2) We designed encoding and decoding algorithms for high dimensional Hilbert
order. Hilbert order has good locality, and it has wide applications in various
fields in computer science, such as memory management, database, and dynamic
load balancing.
  3) We implemented refinement tree and space filling curve based mesh
partitioning algorithms in PHG, and designed the dynamic load balancing module
of PHG. The refinement tree based partitioning algorithm was originally
proposed by Mitchell, the one implemented in PHG was improved in several
aspects. The space filling curve based mesh partitioning function in PHG can
use either Hilbert or Morton space filling curve.
  4) We studied existing hp-adaptive strategies in the literature, and proposed
a new strategy. Numerical experiments show that our new strategy achieves
exponential convergence, and is superior, in both precision of the solutions
and computation time, to the strategy compared. This part of the work also
serves to validate the hp-adaptivity module of PHG.

interest since they were shown to universally achieve the capacity of binary
memoryless channels under low-complexity belief-propagation decoding. In this
work, we focus primarily on the performance of these ensembles over binary
channels affected by bursts of erasures. We first develop an analysis of the
finite length performance for a single burst per codeword and no errors
otherwise. We first assume that the burst erases a complete spatial position,
modeling for instance node failures in distributed storage. We provide new
tight lower bounds for the block erasure probability ($P_{\mathrm{B}}$) at
finite block length and bounds on the coupling parameter for being
asymptotically able to recover the burst. We further show that expurgating the
ensemble can improve the block erasure probability by several orders of
magnitude. Later we extend our methodology to more general channel models. In a
first extension, we consider bursts that can start at a random position in the
codeword and span across multiple spatial positions. Besides the finite length
analysis, we determine by means of density evolution the maximnum correctable
burst length. In a second extension, we consider the case where in addition to
a single burst, random bit erasures may occur. Finally, we consider a block
erasure channel model which erases each spatial position independently with
some probability $p$, potentially introducing multiple bursts simultaneously.
All results are verified using Monte-Carlo simulations.

key characteristics of these systems that complicate the design of feedback

design on a planar pushing system, where the purpose is to control the motion
of a sliding object on a flat surface using a point robotic pusher. The
pusher-slider is a simple dynamical system that retains many of the challenges
that are typical of robotic manipulation tasks.
  Our results show that a model predictive control approach used in tandem with
integer programming offers a powerful solution to capture the dynamic
constraints associated with the friction cone as well as the hybrid nature of
the contact. In order to achieve real-time control, simplifications are
proposed to speed up the integer program. The concept of Family of Modes (FOM)
is introduced to solve an online convex optimization problem by selecting a set
of contact mode schedules that spans a large set of dynamic behaviors that can
occur during the prediction horizon. The controller design is applied to
stabilize the motion of a sliding object about a nominal trajectory, and to
re-plan its trajectory in real-time to follow a moving target. We validate the
controller design through numerical simulations and experimental results on an
industrial ABB IRB 120 robotic arm.

retrieving the distance coefficient in the gravity model which is one of the

Abelian symmetry. The scalar field is then identified with the Goldstone mode

very similar to the ones of ultralocal theories where the scalar-field value is
directly determined by the local matter density. This leads to a complete
screening of the fifth force in the Solar System and between compact objects,
through the ultralocal screening mechanism. On the other hand, the fifth force
can have large effects in extended structures with large-scale density
gradients, such as galactic halos. Interestingly, it can either amplify or damp
Newtonian gravity, depending on the model parameters. We also study the
background cosmology and the linear cosmological perturbations. The background
cosmology is hardly different from its $\Lambda$-CDM counterpart whilst
cosmological perturbations crucially depend on whether the coupling function is
convex or concave. For concave functions, growth is hindered by the
repulsiveness of the fifth force whilst it is enhanced in the convex case. In
both cases, the departures from the $\Lambda$-CDM cosmology increase on smaller
scales and peak for galactic structures. For concave functions, the formation
of structure is largely altered below some characteristic mass, as smaller
structures are delayed and would form later through fragmentation, as in some
warm dark matter scenarios. For convex models, small structures form more
easily than in the $\Lambda$-CDM scenario.

locations of atoms is symmetric, condensed into a few lattice groups.
Therefore, by identifying the underlying lattice in a given image, individual
atoms can be accurately located. We propose to formulate the identification of
the lattice groups as a sparse group selection problem. Furthermore, real
atomic scale images contain defects and vacancies, so atomic identification
based solely on a lattice group may result in false positives and false
negatives. To minimize error, model includes an individual sparsity
regularization in addition to the group sparsity for a within-group selection,
which results in a regression model with a two-level sparsity regularization.
We propose a modification of the group orthogonal matching pursuit (gOMP)
algorithm with a thresholding step to solve the atom finding problem. The
convergence and statistical analyses of the proposed algorithm are presented.
The proposed algorithm is also evaluated through numerical experiments with
simulated images. The applicability of the algorithm on determination of atom

demonstrated using three real STEM images. We believe this is an important step

Fe-based materials is electronic in nature due to orbital ordering. An
universal correlations among various structural parameters and electronic

Fe\--Fe distances in the low temperature orthorhombic phase, with the band
energies E$_{d_{xz}}$, E$_{d_{yz}}$ of Fe at the high symmetry points of the
Brillouin zone. The fractional co-ordinate $z_{As}$ of $As$ which essentially
determines anion height is inversely (directly) proportional to Fe-As bond
distances (with exceptions of K doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$) for hole (electron) doped
materials as a function of doping. On the other hand, Fe-As bond-distance is
found to be inversely (directly) proportional to the density of states at the

zero field, the model has an exponentially large degenerate classical ground
state, which can be affected by quantum fluctuations for non-zero field toward
a unique quantum ground state. We consider two types of quantum fluctuations,
harmonic ones by using linear spin wave theory (LSWT) with single-spin flip
excitations above a long range magnetically ordered background and anharmonic
fluctuations, by employing a cluster-operator approach (COA) with multi-spin
cluster type fluctuations above a non-magnetic cluster ordered background. Our
findings reveal that the harmonic fluctuations of LSWT fail to lift the
extensive degeneracy as well as signaling a violation of the Hellmann-Feynman

lift the degeneracy toward a string-valence bond solid (VBS) state, which is
obtained from an effective theory consistent with the Hellmann-Feynman theorem
as well. Our results are further confirmed by implementing numerical tree
tensor network simulation. The emergent non-magnetic string-VBS phase is gapped

bears a continuous quantum phase transition at $\Gamma/J_1 \cong 0.50$ to the

that language models can improve code suggestion systems by learning from
software repositories. This paper introduces a neural language model with a
sparse pointer network aimed at capturing very long-range dependencies. We
release a large-scale code suggestion corpus of 41M lines of Python code
crawled from GitHub. On this corpus, we found standard neural language models
to perform well at suggesting local phenomena, but struggle to refer to
identifiers that are introduced many tokens in the past. By augmenting a neural
language model with a pointer network specialized in referring to predefined
classes of identifiers, we obtain a much lower perplexity and a 5 percentage
points increase in accuracy for code suggestion compared to an LSTM baseline.
In fact, this increase in code suggestion accuracy is due to a 13 times more
accurate prediction of identifiers. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis shows
this model indeed captures interesting long-range dependencies, like referring

star formation history will be future ultra-deep radio surveys. While star
formation rates (SFRs) are regularly estimated with phenomenological formulas
based on the local FIR-radio correlation, we present here a physically
motivated model to relate star formation with radio fluxes. Such a relation
holds only in frequency ranges where the flux is dominated by synchrotron
emission, as this radiation originates from cosmic rays produced in supernova
remnants, therefore reflecting recent star formation. At low frequencies
synchrotron emission can be absorbed by the free-free mechanism. This
suppression becomes stronger with increasing number density of the gas, more
precisely of the free electrons. We estimate the critical observing frequency
below which radio emission is not tracing the SFR, and use the three
well-studied local galaxies M 51, M 82, and Arp 220 as test cases for our
model. If the observed galaxy is at high redshift, this critical frequency
moves along with other spectral features to lower values in the observing
frame. In the absence of systematic evolutionary effects, one would therefore
expect that the method can be applied at lower observing frequencies for high
redshift observations. However, in case of a strong increase of the typical gas
column densities towards high redshift, the increasing free-free absorption may
erase the star formation signatures at low frequencies. At high radio
frequencies both, free-free emission and the thermal bump, can dominate the
spectrum, also limiting the applicability of this method.

employed to describe the optical properties of nano-plasmonic scatterers and
waveguides. Brief derivations for both the NHD model and the GNOR model are
presented. The formulations of the HDG method are given, in which we introduce
two hybrid variables living only on the skeleton of the mesh. The local field
solutions are expressed in terms of the hybrid variables in each element. Two
conservativity conditions are globally enforced to make the problem solvable
and to guarantee the continuity of the tangential component of the electric
field and the normal component of the current density. Numerical results show
that the proposed HDG methods converge at optimal rate. We benchmark our

complex nanophotonic problems.

affecting the long-term spin evolution of pulsars and possible evolutionary
connections between the various pulsar populations. For young pulsars the
long-term trends are generally obscured by short term phenomena such as timing
noise and the recoveries form large glitches. Here we present a new method to
overcome the latter and report on braking index measurements for the Vela-like
pulsars PSR B1800-21 and PSR B1823-13, an updated measurement for Vela and new
estimates for four more glitching pulsars observed at Jodrell Bank Observatory.
The values of braking indices describe the long-term evolution of the pulsars
across the P-P' diagram. Despite some measurements being affected by
considerable uncertainties, there is evidence for a common trend involving low
braking indices (n<=2) among young glitching pulsars. Such values introduce a
new variant in the evolution of young pulsars and their relationship with other
populations in the P-P' diagram. Low braking indices also imply that these
pulsars could be a few times older than their characteristic ages. We consider
PSR B1757-24 and conclude that the pulsar could be old enough to be related to
the supernova remnant G5.4-1.2. Between glitches, the short-term evolution of
Vela-like pulsars is characterised by large inter-glitch braking indices n_ig >
10. We interpret both short and long term trends as signatures of the large
glitch activity, and speculate that they are driven by short-term post-glitch
re-coupling and a cumulative long-term decoupling of superfluid to the rotation
of the star.

further increase in the amount of data vehicles consume. Considering how
difficult WiFi offloading in vehicular environments is, the bulk of this
additional load will be served by cellular networks. Cellular networks, in
turn, will resort to caching at the network edge in order to reduce the strain
on their core network, an approach also known as mobile edge computing, or fog
computing. In this work, we exploit a real-world, large-scale trace coming from
the users of the We-Fi app in order to (i) understand how significant the
contribution of vehicular users is to the global traffic demand; (ii) compare
the performance of different caching architectures; and (iii) studying how such
a performance is influenced by recommendation systems and content locality. We
express the price of fog computing through a metric called price-of-fog,
accounting for the extra caches to deploy compared to a traditional,
centralized approach. We find that fog computing allows a very significant
reduction of the load on the core network, and the price thereof is low in all
cases and becomes negligible if content demand is location specific. We can
therefore conclude that vehicular networks make an excellent case for the
transition to mobile-edge caching: thanks to the peculiar features of vehicular
demand, we can obtain all the benefits of fog computing, including a reduction
of the load on the core network, reducing the disadvantages to a minimum.

pixel-level accuracy by using two processing streams within our network: One
stream carries information at the full image resolution, enabling precise
adherence to segment boundaries. The other stream undergoes a sequence of
pooling operations to obtain robust features for recognition. The two streams
are coupled at the full image resolution using residuals. Without additional

modelling due to policy risk, but any major changes tend to be `grandfathered'

important changes were made in regards to allocated pension accounts -- the
income means-test is now based on deemed income rather than account
withdrawals, and the income-test deduction no longer applies. We examine the
implications of the new changes in regards to optimal decisions for
consumption, investment, and housing. We account for regulatory minimum
withdrawal rules that are imposed by regulations on allocated pension accounts,
as well as the 2017 asset-test rebalancing. The new policy changes are modelled
in a utility maximizing lifecycle model and solved as an optimal stochastic
control problem. We find that the new rules decrease the benefits from planning
the consumption in relation to the means-test, while the housing allocation
increases slightly in order to receive additional Age Pension. The difference
in optimal drawdown between the old and new policy are only noticeable early in
retirement until regulatory minimum withdrawal rates are enforced. However, the
amount of extra Age Pension received for many households is now significantly
different due to the new deeming income rules, which benefit slightly wealthier
households who previously would receive no Age Pension due to the income-test

parameter of the system. Numerical and theoretical approaches are used in order
to determine this information-function for both DLA and DBM. In the latter, a
connection to the R\'enyi entropies and generalized dimensions of the cluster
is made, showing that DLA could be considered as the point of maximum
information-entropy production along the DBM transition. These findings are in
good agreement with previous theoretical and numerical results (two- and
three-dimensional DBM, and high-dimensional DLA). Notably, the DBM dimensions
can be conformed to a universal description independently of the initial
cluster-configuration and the embedding-space.

becomes smaller and the area of c-plane GaN becomes larger, while the total

  due to be published by Springer",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We discuss coloring and partitioning questions related to Sperner's Lemma,
originally motivated by an application in hardness of approximation.
Informally, we call a partitioning of the $(k-1)$-dimensional simplex into $k$
parts, or a labeling of a lattice inside the simplex by $k$ colors,
""Sperner-admissible"" if color $i$ avoids the face opposite to vertex $i$. The
questions we study are of the following flavor: What is the Sperner-admissible
labeling/partitioning that makes the total area of the boundary between
different colors/parts as small as possible?
  First, for a natural arrangement of ""cells"" in the simplex, we prove an
optimal lower bound on the number of cells that must be non-monochromatic in
any Sperner-admissible labeling. This lower bound is matched by a simple
labeling where each vertex receives the minimum admissible color.
  Second, we show for this arrangement that in contrast to Sperner's Lemma,
there is a Sperner-admissible labeling such that every cell contains at most
$4$ colors.
  Finally, we prove a geometric variant of the first result: For any
Sperner-admissible partition of the regular simplex, the total surface area of
the boundary shared by at least two different parts is minimized by the Voronoi
partition $(A^*_1,\ldots,A^*_k)$ where $A^*_i$ contains all the points whose
closest vertex is $i$. We also discuss possible extensions of this result to
general polytopes and some open questions.

with only one ${\bf 10}$-plet and one $\overline{\bf 126}$-plet Higgs fields
and it is highly non-trivial if the realistic quark and lepton mass matrices
can be reproduced in this context. It has been known that the best fit for all
the SM fermion mass matrices is achieved by a vacuum expectation value of the
$\overline{\bf 126}$-plet Higgs field being at the intermediate scale of around
${\cal O}(10^{13})$ GeV. Under the presence of the SO(10) symmetry breaking at
the intermediate scale, the successful SM gauge coupling unification is at risk
and likely to be spoiled. Recently, it has been shown that the low-energy
fermion mass matrices, except for the down-quark mass predicted to be too low,
are very well-fitted without the intermediate scale. In order to resolve the
too-low down quark mass while keeping the other fittings intact, we consider
SUSY threshold corrections to reproduce the right down quark mass. It turns out
that this requires flavor-dependent soft parameters. Motivated by this fact, we
calculate particle mass spectra at low energies with flavor-dependent sfermion
masses at the grand unification scale. We present a benchmark particle mass
spectrum which satisfies a variety of phenomenological constraints, in
particular, the observed SM-like Higgs boson mass of around 125 GeV and the
relic abundance of the neutralino dark matter as well as the experimental
result of the muon anomalous magnetic moment. In the resultant mass spectrum,
sleptons in the first and second generations, bino and winos are all light, and
this scenario can be tested at the LHC Run-2 in the near future.

so dramatically that initially it was believed, albeit ultimately proved wrong,
that explosive percolation (EP) exhibits first order transition. In the case of
EP, much efforts were devoted to resolving the issue of its order of transition
and almost no effort being devoted to find critical point, critical exponents
etc., to classify it into universality classes. This is in sharp contrast to
the classical random percolation. We do not even know all the exponents of EP

results. A flare ribbon overlapped with the sunspot umbra, which is typical of
large particle events. Atypical were: i) long duration of the flare of more
than one hour; ii) moderate intensity of a microwave burst, about $10^4$ sfu;
iii) low peak frequency of the gyrosynchrotron spectrum, around 6 GHz; and its
insensitivity to the flux increase by more than one order of magnitude. This
was accompanied by a nearly constant ratio of the flux emitted by the volume in
the high-frequency part of the spectrum to its elevated low-frequency part
determined by the area of the source. With the self-similarity of the spectrum,
a similarity was observed between the moving microwave sources and the
brightest parts of the flare ribbons in 1600 \AA. Comparison of the 17 GHz and
1600 \AA\ images has confirmed that the microwave sources were associated with
multiple flare loops, whose footpoints appeared in ultraviolet as intermittent
bright kernels. To understand the properties of the event, we simulated its
microwave emission using a system of several homogeneous gyrosynchrotron
sources above the ribbons. The scatter between the spectra and sizes of the
individual sources is determined by the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field
within the ribbons. The microwave flux is mainly governed by the magnetic flux
passing through the ribbons and the sources. An apparent simplicity of
microwave structures is caused by a poorer spatial resolution and dynamic range
of the microwave imaging. The results indicate that microwave manifestations of
accelerated electrons correspond to the structures observed in thermal
emissions, as well-known models predict.

Americans consumed drugs in the past few 30 days. Combating illicit drug use is
of great interest to public health and law enforcement agencies. Despite of the
importance, most of the existing studies on drug uses rely on surveys. Surveys
on sensitive topics such as drug use may not be answered truthfully by the
people taking them. Selecting a representative sample to survey is another
major challenge. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using big
multimedia data, including both images and text, from social media in order to
discover drug use patterns at fine granularity with respect to demographics.
Instagram posts are searched and collected by drug related terms by analyzing
the hashtags supplied with each post. A large and dynamic dictionary of
frequent drug related slangs is used to find these posts. User demographics are
extracted using robust face image analysis algorithms. These posts are then
mined to find common trends with regard to the time and location they are
posted, and further in terms of age and gender of the drug users. Furthermore,
by studying the accounts followed by the users of drug related posts, we
extract common interests shared by drug users.

GLEAM sources above a flux density limit of 100 mJy that were not present in
the TGSS ADR1; and also for compact TGSS ADR1 sources above a flux density
limit of 200 mJy that had no counterpart in GLEAM. From a total sample of 234
333 GLEAM sources and 275 612 TGSS ADR1 sources in the overlap region between
the two surveys, there were 99658 GLEAM sources and 38 978 TGSS ADR sources
that passed our flux density cutoff and compactness criteria. Analysis of these
sources resulted in three candidate transient sources. Further analysis ruled
out two candidates as imaging artefacts. We analyse the third candidate and
show it is likely to be real, with a flux density of 182 +/- 26 mJy at 147.5

We present initial follow-up observations and discuss possible causes for this

the high reliability of these two new low-frequency radio catalogues.

integrated with a Kannada spell checker and a mechanism for generating

Kannada spell checker with sandhi splitter has an improved performance. It is
twice as fast, 200 times more space efficient, and it is 90% accurate in case

recent, but fast-growing issues in astro-particle physics, including leptonic
mixings and CP violation in neutrino oscillation, high-energy neutrinos, QCD
axion, and axion cooling of stars. The QCD axion decay constant, through its
connection to the astrophysical constraints of stellar evolution and the SM

urgent problem due to the expected increase of automation in civilian airspace
in the near future. Although this problem has been studied in the past, there
has not been a method that guarantees both goal satisfaction and safety for
vehicles with general nonlinear dynamics while taking into account disturbances
and potential adversarial agents, to the best of our knowledge. Hamilton-Jacobi
(HJ) reachability is the ideal tool for guaranteeing goal satisfaction and
safety under such scenarios, and has been successfully applied to many
small-scale problems. However, a direct application of HJ reachability in most
cases becomes intractable when there are more than two vehicles due to the
exponentially scaling computational complexity with respect to system
dimension. In this paper, we take advantage of the guarantees HJ reachability
provides, and eliminate the computation burden by assigning a strict priority
ordering to the vehicles under consideration. Under this sequential path
planning (SPP) scheme, vehicles reserve ""space-time"" portions in the airspace,
and the space-time portions guarantee dynamic feasibility, collision avoidance,
and optimality of the paths given the priority ordering. With a computation
complexity that scales quadratically when accounting for both disturbances and
an intruder, and linearly when accounting for only disturbances, SPP can
tractably solve the multi-vehicle path planning problem for vehicles with
general nonlinear dynamics in a practical setting. We demonstrate our theory in
representative simulations.

functional alignment methods, which can be mathematically formulated by the
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) methods. Since HA mostly uses the
unsupervised CCA techniques, its solution may not be optimized for MVP
analysis. By incorporating the idea of Local Discriminant Analysis (LDA) into
CCA, this paper proposes Local Discriminant Hyperalignment (LDHA) as a novel
supervised HA method, which can provide better functional alignment for MVP
analysis. Indeed, the locality is defined based on the stimuli categories in
the train-set, where the correlation between all stimuli in the same category
will be maximized and the correlation between distinct categories of stimuli
approaches to near zero. Experimental studies on multi-subject MVP analysis
confirm that the LDHA method achieves superior performance to other

We report our
multiwavelength observations of the GOES X1.6 solar flare and the accompanying
halo CME produced by the eruption of a sigmoidal magnetic flux rope (MFR) in
NOAA active region (AR) 12158 on 2014 September 10. The eruption was observed
by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory
(SDO). The photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms were observed by the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard SDO. The soft X-ray (SXR) fluxes
were recorded by the GOES spacecraft. The halo CME was observed by the white
light coronagraphs of the Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) aboard
SOHO.} {About 96 minutes before the onset of flare/CME, narrow pre-flare
coronal dimmings appeared at the two ends of the twisted MFR. They extended
very slowly with their intensities decreasing with time, while their apparent
widths (8$-$9 Mm) nearly kept constant. During the impulsive and decay phases
of flare, typical fanlike twin dimmings appeared and expanded with much larger
extent and lower intensities than the pre-flare dimmings. The percentage of 171
{\AA} intensity decrease reaches 40\%. The pre-flare dimmings are most striking
in 171, 193, and 211 {\AA} with formation temperatures of 0.6$-$2.5 MK. The
northern part of the pre-flare dimmings could also be recognized in 131 and 335
{\AA}.} To our knowledge, this is the first detailed study of pre-flare coronal
dimmings, which can be explained by the density depletion as a result of the
gradual expansion of the coronal loop system surrounding the MFR during the
slow rise of the MFR.

application in fisheries and aquaculture has been conducted. This paper
summarizes scientific literature that describes decision support systems
applied to the domain of Fisheries and Aquaculture. We use an established

aquaculture exists? What are the most investigated fishery and aquaculture
decision support systems topics and how have these changed over time? Do any
current DSS for fisheries provide real- time analytics? Do DSSes in Fisheries
and Aquaculture build their models using machine learning done on captured and

as relevant and gives an exposition on the primary methods concluded in the
study for designing a decision support system. We provide an analysis of the

(TRGO, Treduction = 200, 300, 500, 700 and 900 C) have been investigated in the
temperature interval 1.5 - 20 K. The effect of the annealing temperature on the
structural characteristics of the samples was examined by the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) technique. On lowering the temperature from 20 K to 11-12 K, the time of
4He sorption increased for all the samples, which is typically observed under
the condition of thermally activated diffusion. Below 5 K the characteristic
times of 4He sorption by the GtO and TRGO-200 samples were only weakly
dependent on temperature, suggesting the dominance of the tunnel mechanism. In
the same region (T<5 K) the characteristic times of the TRGOs reduced at higher
temperatures (300, 500, 700 and 900 C) were growing with lowering temperature,
presumably due to the defects generated in the carbon planes on removing the
oxygen functional groups (oFGs). The estimates of the activation energy (Ea) of
4He diffusion show that in the TRGO-200 sample the Ea value is 2.9 times lower
as compared to the parent GtO, which is accounted for by GtO exfoliation due to
evaporation of the water intercalated in the interlayer space of carbon. The
nonmonotonic dependences Ea vs T for the GtO samples treated above 200 C are
determined by a competition between two processes - the recovery of the
graphite carbon structure, which increases the activation energy, and the
generation of defects, which decreases the activation energy by opening
additional surface areas and ways for sorption. The dependence of the
activation energy on treatment temperature correlates well with the contents of
the crystalline phase in GtO varying with a rise of the annealing temperature.

[OIII]5007 flux increases monotonically by $\approx$30 per cent in 2003-2014.
The narrow Balmer lines show similar monotonic increase, while the variability
patterns of the [OI]6300 narrow line are completely different from that of
[OIII]. The reverberation lags are found to be 88.6$\pm$8.4, 161$\pm$15, and
113$\pm$14d for the H$\beta$, H$\alpha$, and H$\gamma$ broad emission-lines,
respectively. The reverberation mass of the central black hole equals to

converts the virial product to a mass to be f=5.5. A difference between both
masses can point to a difference between kinematics of the H$\alpha$ and
H$\beta$ emission regions. We show that the reverberation mapping can only be
applied to the entire period of observations of the 3C390.3 nucleus after
removing a long-term trend. This trend has been expressed by a slowly varying
scalefactor c(t) in the power-law relationship between the line and continuum
fluxes: $F_{line}\propto c(t)\,F_{cont}^a$. We find the power-law index $a$
equals to 0.77 and 0.54 for the H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ lines, respectively. The
observed relationship between the Balmer decrement and the optical continuum
flux is as follows: $F(H\alpha)/F(H\beta) \propto F_{cont}^{-0.20}$ and
$F(H\beta)/F(H\gamma) \propto F_{cont}^{-0.18}$. The 3C390.3 nucleus is an

is similar to Type A, but instead of the entire course being flipped, a single
topic is flipped. Type D uses the traditional lecture style. By considering
exam scores and students' feedback, both quantitative and qualitative aspects
of the flipped pedagogy were investigated. Quantitative analysis indicates a
statistically significant difference in the exam scores between instruction

We found the alignment angles between the spin axes of disc galaxies, or the
minor axes of elliptical galaxies, and the direction of anisotropy. The
distributions of cosines of these angles are compared to the random
distributions to analyse the alignment of galaxies. Sab galaxies show
perpendicular alignment relative to the direction of anisotropy in a sparse
environment, for single galaxies and galaxies of low luminosity. Most of the
parallel alignment of Scd galaxies comes from dense regions, from 2...3 member
groups and from galaxies with low luminosity. The perpendicular alignment of S0
galaxies does not depend strongly on environmental density nor luminosity; it
is detected for single and 2...3 member group galaxies, and for main galaxies
of 4...10 member groups. The perpendicular alignment of elliptical galaxies is
clearly detected for single galaxies and for members of < 11 member groups; the
alignment increases with environmental density and luminosity. We confirm the
existence of fossil tidally induced alignment of Sab galaxies at low z. The
alignment of Scd galaxies can be explained via the infall of matter to
filaments. S0 galaxies may have encountered relatively massive mergers along
the direction of anisotropy. Major mergers along this direction can explain the
alignment of elliptical galaxies. Less massive, but repeated mergers are
possibly responsible for the formation of elliptical galaxies in sparser areas

by laser pulses is experimentally consolidated and fairly well understood.
However, uncertainties remain in the analysis of particle-in-cell (PIC)

  The energy spectrum is exponential with a cut-off, but the maximum energy
depends on the simulation time, following different laws in two and three
dimensional (2D, 3D) PIC simulations, so that the determination of an
asymptotic value has some arbitrariness.
  We propose two empirical laws for rise time of the cut-off energy in 2D and
3D PIC simulations, suggested by a model in which the proton acceleration is
due to a surface charge distribution on the target rear side. The kinetic
energy of the protons that we obtain follows two distinct laws, which appear to
be nicely satisfied by PIC simulations. The laws depend on two parameters: the
scaling time, at which the energy starts to rise, and the asymptotic cut-off
energy.
  The values of the cut-off energy, obtained by fitting the 2D and 3D
simulations for the same target and laser pulse, are comparable. This suggests
that parametric scans can be performed with 2D simulations, since 3D ones are
computationally very expensive. In this paper, the simulations are carried out
for $a_0=3$ with the PIC code ALaDyn by changing the target thickness $L$ and
the incidence angle $\alpha$. A monotonic dependence, on $L$ for normal
incidence and on $\alpha$ for fixed $L$, is found, as in the experimental

regions and the specular components of highlight regions. In this paper, we
propose a novel way to achieve color constancy by exploiting such clues. The
key to our approach lies in the use of suitably extracted derivative colors,
which are able to compute the illuminant color robustly with kernel density
estimation. While extracting derivative colors from achromatic regions to
approximate the illuminant color well is basically straightforward, the success
of our extraction in highlight regions is attributed to the different rates of
variation of the diffuse and specular magnitudes in the dichromatic reflection
model. The proposed approach requires no training phase and is simple to
implement. More significantly, it performs quite satisfactorily under
inter-database parameter settings. Our experiments on three standard databases
demonstrate its effectiveness and fine performance in comparison to

nanoelectronics applications. Based on first-principles density-functional
theory calculations with including van der Waals interactions, we present a
comparative study of the diffusion characteristics of oxygen (O) and fluorine
(F) atoms both on graphene and between the layers of bilayer graphene. We find
that O and F atoms have lower binding energies between the layers of bilayer
graphene compared to on graphene. Interestingly, the calculated diffusion
barrier for the O atom slightly increases from 0.81 eV on graphene to 0.85 eV
within bilayer graphene, while that for the F atom significantly decreases from
0.30 eV on graphene to 0.18 eV within bilayer graphene. Such contrasting
behaviors of the O and F diffusions within bilayer graphene can be traced to
their different bonding natures: i.e., the O adatom that has a strongly
covalent C$-$O$-$C bonding on the bridge site of the C$-$C bond diffuses on one
graphene layer with a slight interference of the other layer, while the F
adatom that has a weakly ionic F$-$C bonding on top of a C atom easily diffuses
by hopping between two graphene layers with accepting more electron charges
from the two layers. The present findings have important implications for
understanding the diffusion processes of F and O atoms on graphene and within
bilayer graphene.

escalation and remote code execution attacks. Previous proposals on rowhammer
mitigation either require hardware changes or follow heuristic-based approaches
(based on CPU performance counters). To date, there exists no instant
protection against rowhammer attacks on legacy systems.
  In this paper, we present the design and implementation of two practical and
efficient software-only defenses against rowhammer attacks. Our defenses
prevent the attacker from leveraging rowhammer to corrupt physically co-located
data in memory that is owned by a different system entity. Our first defense,
B-CATT, extends the system bootloader to disable vulnerable physical memory.
B-CATT is highly practical, does not require changes to the operating system,
and can be deployed on virtually all x86-based systems. While B-CATT is able to
stop all known rowhammer attacks, it does not yet tackle the fundamental
problem of missing memory isolation in physical memory. To address this
problem, we introduce our second defense G-CATT, a generic solution that
extends the physical memory allocator of the OS to physically isolate the
memory of different system entities (e.g., kernel and user space).
  As proof of concept, we implemented B-CATT on x86, and our generic defense,
G-CATT, on x86 and ARM to mitigate rowhammer-based kernel exploits. Our
extensive evaluation shows that both mitigation schemes (i) can stop available
real- world rowhammer attacks, (ii) impose virtually no run-time overhead for
common user and kernel benchmarks as well as commonly used applications, and
(iii) do not affect the stability of the overall system.

the Mellin representation of $CFT_d$ four point functions and expands them in
terms of crossing symmetric combinations of $AdS_{d+1}$ Witten exchange
functions. We consider arbitrary external scalar operators and set up the
conditions for consistency with the operator product expansion. Namely, we
demand cancellation of spurious powers (of the cross ratios, in position space)
which translate into spurious poles in Mellin space. We discuss two contexts in
which we can immediately apply this method by imposing the simplest set of
constraint equations. The first is the epsilon expansion. We mostly focus on
the Wilson-Fisher fixed point as studied in an epsilon expansion about $d=4$.
We reproduce Feynman diagram results for operator dimensions to $O(\epsilon^3)$
rather straightforwardly. This approach also yields new analytic predictions
for OPE coefficients to the same order which fit nicely with recent numerical
estimates for the Ising model (at $\epsilon =1$). We will also mention some
leading order results for scalar theories near three and six dimensions. The
second context is a large spin expansion, in any dimension, where we are able
to reproduce and go a bit beyond some of the results recently obtained using
the (double) light cone expansion. We also have a preliminary discussion about
numerical implementation of the above bootstrap scheme in the absence of a
small parameter.

fluctuations between realizations, which overestimates the actual velocity
variability. Effective dispersion on the other hand quantifies the actual
blockscale velocity variability and thus reflects the impact of subscale

quantify the impact of subscale velocity fluctuations on solute particle
spreading and determine the governing equations for the coarse-grained

expressions for the average and variance of the blockscale dispersion tensor in
3D flow fields as a function of the structural parameters characterizing the

approximately 9500, 15000, and $<71000\,$K, at 21, 9, and 3 GHz, respectively,
which are consistent with the values of the quiet Sun. The emission is most
likely dominated by optically thick thermal emission from an upper chromosphere
at 21 and 9 GHz. We discuss other possible additional sources of emission at
all frequencies and show that there may also be a small contribution from
gyroresonance emission above active regions, coronal free-free emission and
free-free emission from an optically thin stellar wind, particularly at the
lower frequencies. We constrain the maximum mass-loss rate from Pollux to be
less than $3.7\times 10^{-11}\,M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (assuming a wind terminal
velocity of 215 km s$^{-1}$), which is about an order of magnitude smaller than
previous constraints for coronal giants and is in agreement with existing
predictions for the mass-loss rate of Pollux. These are the first detections of
thermal radio emission from a single (i.e., non-binary) coronal giant and
demonstrate that low activity coronal giants like Pollux have atmospheres at

AeBe stars originates in the dust of a circumstellar disk. Aims. The aims of
this article are to infer the radial and vertical structure of these disks at
scales of order one au, and the properties of the dust grains. Methods. The
program objects (51 in total) were observed with the H-band (1.6micron)
PIONIER/VLTI interferometer. The largest baselines allowed us to resolve (at
least partially) structures of a few tenths of an au at typical distances of a
few hundred parsecs. Dedicated UBVRIJHK photometric measurements were also
obtained. Spectral and 2D geometrical parameters are extracted via fits of a
few simple models: ellipsoids and broadened rings with azimuthal modulation.
Model bias is mitigated by parallel fits of physical disk models. Sample
statistics were evaluated against similar statistics for the physical disk
models to infer properties of the sample objects as a group. Results. We find
that dust at the inner rim of the disk has a sublimation temperature
Tsub~1800K. A ring morphology is confirmed for approximately half the resolved
objects; these rings are wide delta_r>=0.5. A wide ring favors a rim that, on
the star-facing side, looks more like a knife edge than a doughnut. The data
are also compatible with a the combination of a narrow ring and an inner disk
of unspecified nature inside the dust sublimation radius. The disk inner part
has a thickness z/r~0.2, flaring to z/r~0.5 in the outer part. We confirm the
known luminosity-radius relation; a simple physical model is consistent with
both the mean luminosity-radius relation and the ring relative width; however,
a significant spread around the mean relation is present. In some of the
objects we find a halo component, fully resolved at the shortest interferometer
spacing, that is related to the HAeBe class.

discuss the effects of the Zeeman spin splitting which is generically present
both in the quantum dot and in the (thin-film) superconductor. The unequal
$g$-factors in semiconductor and superconductor materials result in respective
Zeeman splittings of different magnitude. We consider both classical and

spin-splitting of the Bogoliubov quasiparticle bands as a simple rigid shift.
For the case of collinear magnetization of impurity and host, the Shiba
resonance of a given spin polarization remains unperturbed when it overlaps
with the branch of the quasiparticle excitations of the opposite spin
polarization. In the quantum case, we employ numerical renormalization group
calculations to study the effect of the Zeeman field for different values of
the $g$-factors of the impurity and of the superconductor. We find that in
general the critical magnetic field for the singlet-doublet transition changes
non-monotonically as a function of the superconducting gap, demonstrating the
existence of two different transition mechanisms: Zeeman splitting of Shiba
states or gap closure due to Zeeman splitting of Bogoliubov states. We also
study how in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, modeled as an additional
non-collinear component of the magnetic field at the impurity site, the Shiba
resonance overlapping with the quasiparticle continuum of the opposite spin
gradually broadens and then merges with the continuum.

Gyr) follow a round distribution well fitted by truncated density profiles.
These stars rotate around the projected optical major axis of the galaxy with
line-of-sight velocities $v_{los}(r_h) = 16 \pm 3$ km s$^{-1}$ and a velocity
gradient of $2.06 \pm 0.21$ km s$^{-1}$ arcmin$^{-1}$. Intermediate-age stars
($\lesssim 9$ Gyr) concentrate in the centre of the galaxy and form an
elongated structure extending along the projected optical major axis. This
structure appears to rotate with a velocity gradient of $2.24 \pm 0.22$ km
s$^{-1}$ arcmin$^{-1}$, and around the optical minor axis. The centres of
rotation and kinetic position angles (PA$_{\rm kin}$) of both populations
differ. For intermediate-age stars we obtained PA$_{\rm kin} = 18^\circ \pm
2^\circ$ and for the old ones PA$_{\rm kin} = 63^\circ \pm 3^\circ$ in good
agreement with photometric PA measured from isopleths fitted to the photometry.

be the result of a merger occurred at redshift $z\sim 1.75$.

  interfaces and the role of electronic screening",,,"10.1038/nmat4880",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Room temperature Ionic liquids (RTIL) received considerable attention as a
new class of materials with fundamental importance for energy storage
\cite{Armand2009, Uesugi2013} and active lubrication \cite{Palacio2010,
Dold2015, Smith2013a}. Their unique properties result from the competition of
strong electrostatic interactions with properly designed molecular structure to
avoid crystalization at room temperature. They are however unsual liquids,
which challenge fundamentally the classical frameworks of electrolytes. In
particular their behavior at electrified interfaces remains elusive with very
rich and exotic responses relevant to their electrochemical activity
\cite{Kornyshev2014,Merlet2012,Perkin2013,Atkin2009,Rotenberg2015,Endres2012,Bovio2009a,Bovio2009,Yokota2010}.
In this work, we use quartz tuning fork based AFM nanorheological measurements
to explore the properties of RTIL in nanometric confinement. We unveil a
dramatic change of the RTIL towards a solid-like phase below a threshold
thickness, pointing to a capillary freezing in confinement. This threshold
thickness is found to be intimately related to the metallic nature of the
confining materials, with more metallic surfaces facilitating capillary
freezing. This behavior is interpreted theoretically in terms of the shift of
the freezing transition, taking into account the influence of the electronic
screening on RTIL wetting of the confining surfaces, as described by the simple
Thomas-Fermi approach. Our findings provides fresh views on the properties of
confined RTIL with important implications for their statics and dynamics inside
nanoporous metallic structures. This also suggests applications to tune
nanoscale lubrication with the phase-changing RTIL, by varying the nature as
well as the patterning of the subtrate, and the application of active
polarisation.

prediction of the numerically important self-interference contribution of O_7

introduced to control possible collinear configurations of one of the photons
with the strange quark. Our results are given for exact m_s, in contrast to an
earlier work where only logarithmic and constant terms in m_s were retained.
This improved NLL result for the (O_7, O_7)-interference contribution shows
that finite m_s effects are only sizable near the kinematical endpoints of the
spectrum $d\Gamma/(ds_1 ds_2)$. At the level of the branching ratio, in the
phase-space region considered in this paper, it is observed that $Br[\bar{B}

on this branching ratio is less than 5% when m_s is varied between 400-600 MeV.
For the same phase-space region finite strange quark mass effects for the
branching ratio are less than 7%.

radial flow geometries for the quantification of non-local solute transport
induced by heterogeneous flow distributions and by mobile-immobile mass
transfer processes. To this end we derive a general CTRW framework in radial
coordinates starting from the random walk equations for radial particle
positions and times. The particle density, or solute concentration is governed
by a non-local radial advection-dispersion equation (ADE). Unlike in CTRWs for
uniform flow scenarios, particle transition times here depend on the radial
particle position, which renders the CTRW non-stationary. As a consequence, the
memory kernel characterizing the non-local ADE, is radially dependent. Based on
this general formulation, we derive radial CTRW implementations that (i)
emulate non-local radial transport due to heterogeneous advection, (ii) model
multirate mass transfer (MRMT) between mobile and immobile continua, and (iii)
quantify both heterogeneous advection in a mobile region and mass transfer
between mobile and immobile regions. The expected solute breakthrough behavior
is studied using numerical random walk particle tracking simulations. This
behavior is analyzed by explicit analytical expressions for the asymptotic
solute breakthrough curves. We observe clear power-law tails of the solute
breakthrough for broad (power-law) distributions of particle transit times
(heterogeneous advection) and particle trapping times (MRMT model). The
combined model displays two distinct time regimes. An intermediate regime, in
which the solute breakthrough is dominated by the particle transit times in the
mobile zones, and a late time regime that is governed by the distribution of
particle trapping times in immobile zones.

which encodes mass transfer between the mobile and the immobile regions, is at
the center of this method. We propose two methods to estimate the global memory
function for a fracture network with given fracture and matrix geometry. Both
employ a scaling approach based on the known local memory function for a given

the Science Ground Segment (SGS) Data Quality Common Tools (DQCT), which has
the main role to provide software solutions to gather, evaluate, and record
quality information about the raw and derived data products from a primarily
scientific perspective. The SGS DQCT will provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating the application of reduction and calibration reference data, as well
as diagnostic tools for quality parameters, flags, trend analysis diagrams and
any other metadata parameter produced by the pipeline. In a large programme
like Euclid, it is prohibitively expensive to process large amount of data at
the pixel level just for the purpose of quality evaluation. Thus, all measures
of quality at the pixel level are implemented in the individual pipeline
stages, and passed along as metadata in the production. In this sense most of
the tasks related to science data quality are delegated to the pipeline stages,
even though the responsibility for science data quality is managed at a higher
level. The DQCT subsystem of the SGS is currently under development, but its
path to full realization will likely be different than that of other
subsystems. Primarily because, due to a high level of parallelism and to the
wide pipeline processing redundancy, for instance the mechanism of double
Science Data Center for each processing function, the data quality tools have
not only to be widely spread over all pipeline segments and data levels, but
also to minimize the occurrences of potential diversity of solutions
implemented for similar functions, ensuring the maximum of coherency and
standardization for quality evaluation and reporting in the SGS.

to impose the classicality after the Wick-rotation to the Lorentzian

big bounce, (2) either tunneling from a small to a large universe or a creation
of a collapsing and an expanding universe from nothing, and (3) either a
transition from a contracting to a bouncing phase or a creation of two

Covert aspects of ongoing user mental states provide key context
information for user-aware human computer interactions. In this paper, we focus
on the problem of estimating the vigilance of users using EEG and EOG signals.
Approach. To improve the feasibility and wearability of vigilance estimation
devices for real-world applications, we adopt a novel electrode placement for
forehead EOG and extract various eye movement features, which contain the
principal information of traditional EOG. We explore the effects of EEG from
different brain areas and combine EEG and forehead EOG to leverage their
complementary characteristics for vigilance estimation. Considering that the
vigilance of users is a dynamic changing process because the intrinsic mental
states of users involve temporal evolution, we introduce continuous conditional
neural field and continuous conditional random field models to capture dynamic
temporal dependency. Main results. We propose a multimodal approach to
estimating vigilance by combining EEG and forehead EOG and incorporating the
temporal dependency of vigilance into model training. The experimental results
demonstrate that modality fusion can improve the performance compared with a
single modality, EOG and EEG contain complementary information for vigilance
estimation, and the temporal dependency-based models can enhance the
performance of vigilance estimation. From the experimental results, we observe
that theta and alpha frequency activities are increased, while gamma frequency
activities are decreased in drowsy states in contrast to awake states.
Significance. The forehead setup allows for the simultaneous collection of EEG
and EOG and achieves comparative performance using only four shared electrodes
in comparison with the temporal and posterior sites.

focus on identities relating the same hypergeometric function with two
different algebraic pullback transformations: such remarkable identities
correspond to modular forms, the algebraic transformations being solution of
another differentially algebraic Schwarzian equation that emerged in a paper by
Casale. Further, we show that the first differentially algebraic equation can
be seen as a subcase of the last Schwarzian differential condition, the
restriction corresponding to a factorization condition of some associated
order-two linear differential operator. Finally, we also explore
generalizations of these results, for instance, to $_3F_2$, hypergeometric

a Clausen identity.
  In a $_2F_1$ hypergeometric framework the Schwarzian condition encapsulates
all the modular forms and modular equations of the theory of elliptic curves,

heavier than a real one. In addition to this, each time the coin is on the
scale, it changes its weight in a predetermined fashion.
  In this paper, we seek to find our fake coin using a balance scale and the
smallest number of weighings.
  We consider different possibilities for the fake coin. We discuss coins that
change weight between two states or between three states. The 2- state coin
that changes weight from lighter to real and back has been studied before, so
we concentrate on the 2-state coin that changes weight from lighter to heavier,
and back. We also study the 3-state coin, which changes its weight from lighter
to heavier to real, and back to lighter.
  Given the total number of coins and the starting state of the fake coin, we
calculate the smallest number of weighings needed to identify the fake coin. We
provide an oblivious optimal strategy for this number of weighings. We also
discuss what happens if the starting state is not known or mixed. In such
cases, adaptive strategies are often more powerful than oblivious ones.

  Transfer Using Dielectric Resonators","10 pages, 14 figures",,"10.1063/1.4975404",,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Similar to the hybridization of three atoms, three coupled resonators
interact to form bonding, anti-bonding and non-bonding modes. The non-bonding
mode enables an electromagnetic induced transparency like transfer of energy.
Here the non-bonding mode, resulting from the strong electric coupling of two
dielectric resonators and an enclosure, is exploited to show that it is
feasible to transfer power over a distance comparable to the operating
wavelength. In this scheme, the enclosure acts as a mediator. The strong
coupling permits the excitation of the non-bonding mode with high purity. This
approach is different from resonant inductive coupling which works in the
sub-wavelength regime. Optimal loads and the corresponding maximum efficiency
are determined using two independent methods: Coupled Mode Theory and Circuit
modelling. It is shown that, unlike resonant inductive coupling, the figure of
merit depends on the enclosure quality and not on the load, which emphasizes
the role of the enclosure as a mediator. Briefly after the input excitation is
turned on, the energy in the receiver builds up via all coupled and spurious
modes. As time elapses, all modes except the non-bonding cease to sustain. Due
to the strong coupling between the dielectrics and the enclosure, such systems
have unique properties such as high and uniform efficiency over large
distances; and minimal fringing fields. These properties suggest that
electromagnetic induced transparency like schemes which rely on the use of
dielectric resonators can be used to power autonomous systems inside an
enclosure or find applications when exposure to the fields needs to be minimal.
Finite Element computations are used to verify the theoretical predictions by
determining the transfer efficiency, fields profile and coupling coefficients
for two different systems.

However, the requirement of tailor-made bulk materials and extreme constitutive
parameters associated to illusion designs hampers its further progress.
Inspired by recent demonstrations of metasurfaces in achieving reduced versions
of electromagnetic cloaks, we propose and experimentally demonstrate source
illusion devices to manipulate flexural waves using metasurfaces. The approach
is particularly useful for elastic waves due to the lack of form-invariance in
usual transformation methods. We demonstrate metasurfaces for shifting,
transforming and splitting a point source with ""space-coiling"" structures. The
effects are found to be broadband and robust against a change of source
position, with agreement from numerical simulations and Huygens-Fresnel theory.
The proposed approach provides an avenue to generically manipulate guided
elastic waves in solids, and is potentially useful for applications such as
non-destructive testing, enhanced sensing and imaging.

  Launch Vehicle Navigation using a Space-borne GPS Receiver",,"Proc. ION GNSS+ 2016, Institute of Navigation, Portland, Oregon,
  USA, September 14, 2016",,,"cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a well established technique for position
and velocity estimation. However, the performance of the EKF degrades
considerably in highly non-linear system applications as it requires local
linearisation in its prediction stage. The Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) was
developed to address the non-linearity in the system by deterministic sampling.
The UKF provides better estimation accuracy than the EKF for highly non-linear
systems. However, the UKF requires multiple propagations of sampled state
vectors in the measurement interval, which results in higher processing time
than for the EKF. This paper proposes an application of two newly developed UKF
variants in launch vehicle navigation. These two algorithms called the Single
Propagation Unscented Kalman Filter (SPUKF) and the Extrapolated Single
Propagation Unscented Kalman Filter (ESPUKF), reduce the processing time of the
original UKF significantly and provide estimation accuracies comparable to the
UKF. The estimation performance of the SPUKF and the ESPUKF is demonstrated
using Falcon 9 V1.1 launch vehicle in CRS-5 mission scenario. The launch
vehicle trajectory for the mission is generated using publicly available
mission parameters. A SPIRENT GNSS simulator is used to generate the received
GPS signal on the trajectory. Pseudo-range observations are used in the EKF,
UKF, SPUKF and the ESPUKF separately and the estimation accuracies are
compared. The results show that the estimation errors of the SPUKF and the
ESPUKF are 15.44% and 10.52% higher than the UKF respectively. The processing
time reduces by 83% for the SPUKF and 69.14% for the ESPUKF compared to the
UKF.

  Unscented Kalman Filters",,"Proc. 16th Australian Space Research Conference, Melbourne,
  Australia, 2016",,,"cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Application of two new UKF based estimation techniques with reduced
processing time in re-entry vehicle position and velocity estimation problem
using ground-based range and elevation measurements is presented. The first
method is called the Single Propagation Unscented Kalman Filter (SPUKF) where,
the a postiriori state is propagated only once and then the sampled sigma
points at the next time state are approximated by the first-order Taylor Series
terms. In the second method called the Extrapolated Single Propagation
Unscented Kalman Filter (ESPUKF), the sigma points are approximated to the
second-order Taylor Series terms using the Richardson Extrapolation. The EKF,
SPUKF, ESPUKF and the UKF are utilized in a re-entry vehicle navigation
scenario using range and elevation measurements. The estimation accuracies and
the processing times for different algorithms are compared for the scenario.
The result demonstrates that the UKF provides better accuracy than the EKF but
requires more processing time. The SPUKF accuracy is better than the EKF and
the processing time is significantly less than the UKF. However, the accuracy
of the SPUKF is less than the UKF. The ESPUKF provides estimation accuracy
comparable to the UKF and the processing time is also significantly reduced.

between planar geometric figures formed with straight lines. This function can
in turn be used in partial matching of different geometric figures. For a given
pair of geometric figures that are graphically isomorphic, one function
measures the angular dissimilarity and another function measures the edge
length disproportionality. The distance function is then defined as the convex
sum of these two functions. The novelty of the presented function is that it
satisfies all properties of a distance function and the computation of the same
is done by projecting appropriate features to a cartesian plane. To compute the
deviation from the angular similarity property, the Euclidean distance between
the given angular pairs and the corresponding points on the $y=x$ line is
measured. Further while computing the deviation from the edge length
proportionality property, the best fit line, for the set of edge lengths, which
passes through the origin is found, and the Euclidean distance between the
given edge length pairs and the corresponding point on a $y=mx$ line is
calculated. Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP) is used to find
this best fit line. We demonstrate the behavior of the defined function for
some sample pairs of figures.

considered beneficial to electroluminescence because they relax the strain in
InGaN quantum wells and also enhance the hole lateral injection through
sidewall of V-pits. In this paper, regularly arranged V-pits are formed on
c-plane GaN grown by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy on conventional c-plane
cone-patterned sapphire substrates. The size of V-pits and area of flat GaN can
be adjusted by changing growth temperature. Five pairs of InGaN/GaN
multi-quantumwell and also a light-emitting diode structure are grown on this
V-pit-shaped GaN. Two peaks around 410 nm and 450 nm appearing in both
photoluminescence and cathodeluminescence spectra are from the semipolar
InGaN/GaN multi-quantum-well on sidewalls of V-pits and cplane InGaN/GaN
multi-quantum-well, respectively. In addition, dense bright spots can be
observed on the surface of light-emitting diode when it works under small
injection current, which are believed owing to the enhanced hole injection
around V-pits.
