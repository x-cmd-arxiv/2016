Containers with useful properties have been exhibited by Balogh, Morris and

rotation of the plane of polarization that results when a linearly polarized
signal passes through a magnetized plasma such as a CME. FR observations of a
source near the Sun can provide information on the plasma structure of a CME
shortly after launch.
  We report on simultaneous white-light and radio observations made of three
CMEs in August 2012. We made sensitive Very Large Array (VLA) full-polarization
observations using 1 - 2 GHz frequencies of a ""constellation"" of radio sources
through the solar corona at heliocentric distances that ranged from 6 - 15
solar radii. Of the nine sources observed, three were occulted by CMEs: two
sources (0842+1835 and 0900+1832) were occulted by a single CME and one source
(0843+1547) was occulted by two CMEs. In addition to our radioastronomical
observations, which represent one of the first active hunts for CME Faraday
rotation since Bird et al. (1985) and the first active hunt using the VLA, we
obtained white-light coronagraph images from the LASCO/C3 instrument to
determine the Thomson scattering brightness, BT, providing a means to
independently estimate the plasma density and determine its contribution to the
observed Faraday rotation.
  A constant density force-free flux rope embedded in the background corona was
used to model the effects of the CMEs on BT and FR. We demonstrate this model's
ability to successfully reproduce both BT and FR profiles. The plasma densities
(6 - 22 x 10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$) and axial magnetic field strengths (2 - 12 mG)

fluctuations in the unlensed CMB and instrumental noise can largely be removed
by using a realization-dependent subtraction of lensing reconstruction noise,
leaving a relatively simple covariance model that is dominated by
lensing-induced terms and well described by a small number of principal
components. The correlations between the CMB and lensing power spectra will be
detectable at the level of $\sim 5\sigma$ for a CMB-S4 mission, and neglecting

thermal plasma heating and injection of nonthermal particles, which quickly
cool through inverse Compton scattering and emission of synchrotron radiation.
Synchrotron photons emitted around and above the photosphere are predicted to
dominate the low-energy part of the GRB spectrum, starting from roughly a
decade in energy below the MeV peak. We show that this leads to a unique
polarization signature: a rise in GRB polarization toward lower energies. We
compute the polarization degree of GRB radiation as a function of photon energy
for a generic jet model, and show the predictions for GRBs 990123, 090902B and
110721A. The expected polarization is significant in the X-ray band, in

can be adjusted. Thanks to the low taper- and coupling-losses, the resonator
exhibits an unloaded finesse of F=75+/-1, sufficient for reaching the regime of
strong coupling for emitters placed in the evanescent field. The system is
ideally suited for trapping ensembles of laser-cooled atoms along the nanofiber
section. Based on measured parameters, we estimate that the system can serve as
a platform for optical multimode strong coupling experiments. Finally, we
discuss the possibilities of using the resonator for applications based on
chiral quantum optics.

the structure or geometry of the data, which is often represented by a graph.
In some applications, this structure may be partly determined by design
constraints or pre-determined sensing arrangements, like in road transportation
networks for example. In general though, the data structure is not readily
available and becomes pretty difficult to define. In particular, the global
smoothness assumptions, that most of the existing works adopt, are often too
general and unable to properly capture localized properties of data. In this
paper, we go beyond this classical data model and rather propose to represent
information as a sparse combination of localized functions that live on a data
structure represented by a graph. Based on this model, we focus on the problem
of inferring the connectivity that best explains the data samples at different
vertices of a graph that is a priori unknown. We concentrate on the case where
the observed data is actually the sum of heat diffusion processes, which is a
quite common model for data on networks or other irregular structures. We cast
a new graph learning problem and solve it with an efficient nonconvex
optimization algorithm. Experiments on both synthetic and real world data
finally illustrate the benefits of the proposed graph learning framework and
confirm that the data structure can be efficiently learned from data
observations only. We believe that our algorithm will help solving key
questions in diverse application domains such as social and biological network
analysis where it is crucial to unveil proper geometry for data understanding
and inference.

minimises risk, at a given return target, by diversifying over different
investments. However, the potential scope of such risk diversification can be
limited if investments are concentrated in only one country, or more
specifically one currency. Multi-currency portfolio is an alternative to
achieve higher returns and more diversified portfolios but it requires a
careful management of the entailed risks from changes in exchange rates.
  The deviation between asset and currency exposures in a portfolio is defined
as the ""currency overlay"". This paper addresses risk mitigation by allowing
currency overlay and asset allocation be optimised together. We propose a model
of the international portfolio optimisation problem in which the currency
overlay is constructed by holding foreign exchange rate forward contracts.
Crucially, the cost of carry, transaction costs, and margin requirement of
forward contracts are also taken into account in portfolio return calculation.
This novel extension of previous overlay models improves the accuracy of risk
and return calculation of portfolios; furthermore, our experimental results
show that inclusion of such costs significantly changes the optimal decisions.
Effects of constraints imposed to reduce transaction costs associated are
examined and the empirical results show that risk-return compensation of
portfolios varies significantly with different return targets.

emblematic such objects are probably the Dyck walks and the binary trees, and,
whenever another class of combinatorial objects is counted by the Catalan
numbers, it is natural to search for an explicit bijection between the latter
objects and one of the former objects. In most cases, such a bijection happens
to be relatively simple but it might sometimes be more intricate.
  In this work, we focus on so-called \emph{basketball walks}, which are
integer-valued walks with step-set $\{-2,-1,+1,+2\}$. The presence of $-2$ as
an allowed step makes it impossible to use the classical {\L}ukasiewicz
encoding of trees by integer-valued walks, and thus a different strategy is
needed. We give an explicit bijection that maps, for each $n\ge 2$, $n$-step
basketball walks from $0$ to $0$ that visit $1$ and are positive except at
their extremities to $n$-leaf binary trees. Moreover, we can partition the
steps of a walk into $\pm 1$-steps, odd $+2$-steps or even $-2$-steps, and odd
$-2$-steps or even $+2$-steps, and these three types of steps are mapped
through our bijection to double leaves, left leaves, and right leaves of the
corresponding tree.
  We also prove that basketball walks from $0$ to $1$ that are positive except
at the origin are in bijection with increasing unary-binary trees with
associated permutation avoiding $213$. We furthermore give the refined
generating function of these objects with an extra variable accounting for the
unary nodes.

structure which allows for targeting of specific mechanical, electronic and
optical properties. At the single-molecule level, two major complementary ways
to explore these properties are molecular quantum-dot structures and scanning
probes. This article outlines comprehensive principles of electron-transport
spectroscopy relevant to both these approaches and presents a new,
high-resolution experiment on a high-spin single-molecule junction exemplifying
these principles. Such spectroscopy plays a key role in further advancing our
understanding of molecular and atomic systems, in particular the relaxation of
their spin. In this joint experimental and theoretical analysis, particular
focus is put on the crossover between resonant regime [single-electron
tunneling (SET)] and the off-resonant regime [inelastic electron (co)tunneling
(IETS)]. We show that the interplay of these two processes leads to unexpected
mirages of resonances not captured by either of the two pictures alone.
Although this turns out to be important in a large fraction of the possible
regimes of level positions and bias voltages, it has been given little
attention in molecular transport studies. Combined with nonequilibrium IETS --
four-electron pump-probe excitations -- these mirages provide crucial
information on the relaxation of spin excitations. Our encompassing physical
picture is supported by a master-equation approach that goes beyond weak
coupling. The present work encourages the development of a broader connection
between the fields of molecular quantum-dot and scanning probe spectroscopy.

the problem of pricing and hedging of a financial instrument, referred to as an
option, assuming its payoff depends on a single asset price. In this paper we
introduce Vectorial Martingale Optimal Transport (VMOT) problem, which
considers the more general and realistic situation in which the option payoff
depends on multiple asset prices. We address this problem of pricing and
hedging given market information -- described by vectorial marginal
distributions of underlying asset prices -- which is an intimately relevant
setup in the robust financial framework.
  We establish that the VMOT problem, as an infinite-dimensional linear
programming, admits an optimizer for its dual program. Such existence result of
dual optimizers is significant for several reasons: the dual optimizers
describe how a person who is liable for an option payoff can formulate optimal
hedging portfolios, and more importantly, they can provide crucial information
on the geometry of primal optimizers, i.e. the VMOTs. As an illustration, we
show that multiple martingales given marginals must exhibit an extremal

compromised in the presence of decoherence. This is particularly patent at
blind spots -- phase values at which sensitivity is totally lost. One remedy is
to use a precisely known reference phase to shift the operation point of the
sensor to a less vulnerable phase value. We present here an alternative
approach based on combining the probe with an ancillary degree of freedom
containing adjustable parameters to create an entangled quantum state of higher
dimension. We validate this concept by simulating a configuration of a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a two-photon probe and a polarization ancilla
of adjustable parameters, entangled at a polarizing beam splitter. At the
interferometer output, the photons are measured after an adjustable unitary
transformation in the polarization subspace. Through calculation of the Fisher
information and simulation of an adaptive estimation procedure, we show that
optimizing the adjustable polarization parameters using an adaptive measurement

Examples of this are theories with weakly broken higher spin symmetry and
perturbations around generalised free fields. At the degenerate point we
introduce twist conformal blocks. These are eigenfunctions of certain quartic
operators and encode the contribution, to a given four-point correlator, of the
whole tower of intermediate operators with a given twist. As we perturb around
the degenerate point, the twist degeneracy is lifted. In many situations this
breaking is controlled by inverse powers of the spin. In such cases the twist
conformal blocks can be decomposed into a sequence of functions which we
systematically construct. Decomposing the four-point correlator in this basis
turns crossing symmetry into an algebraic problem. Our method can be applied to
a wide spectrum of conformal field theories in any number of dimensions and at
any order in the breaking parameter. As an example, we compute the spectrum of
various theories around generalised free fields. For theories with higher spin
symmetry we discuss the relation between twist conformal blocks and higher spin

simultaneously compute features on several scales, and use residual connections

Overall, we find that a model with only two cluster- scale dark matter halos

Instead, two additional mass clumps -- a central ""bar"" of mass located between
the BCGs, and another clump located within a ""crown"" of galaxies in the
Northern part of the cluster field -- provide significant improvements to the
fit. Additional physical evidence suggests these clumps are indeed real
features of the system, but with relatively few image constraints in the crown

we study the set of quantum states that can be prepared by the Euclidean path

stabilizer states can be described by topology. In particular, we find an
explicit expression for the entanglement entropy of a many-torus subsystem

To help guide this search, we have developed a phenomenological model for the

We combine successful approaches used in s-wave proximity and standard d-wave
tunneling to reproduce tunneling spectra in d-wave proximity devices, and
clarify the origin of various features. Different variations of the pair
potential are considered, resulting from the proximity-induced
superconductivity. Furthermore, the effective pair potential felt by the
quasiparticles is momentum-dependent in contrast to s-wave superconductors. The
probabilities of reflection and transmission are calculated by solving the
Bogoliubov equations. Our results are consistent with experimental observations
of the unconventional proximity effect and provide important experimental
parameters such as the size and length scale of the proximity induced gap, as
well as the conditions needed to observe the reduced and full superconducting

the gas phase metal abundance, with higher metallicity associated with deeper
deficits at a fixed surface brightness. We supplement the local sample with
resolved [CII] measurements from nearby luminous infrared galaxies and high
redshift sources from z=1.8-6.4, and find that star formation rate density
drives a continuous trend of deepening [CII] deficit across six orders of
magnitude in SFRD. The tightness of this correlation suggests that an
approximate star formation rate density can be estimated directly from global
measurements of [CII]/TIR, and a relation is provided to do so. Several
low-luminosity AGN hosts in the sample show additional and significant central
suppression of [CII]/TIR, but these deficit enhancements occur not in those AGN

universal gate set, in the sense that every permutation of $\{0,1\}^n$ can be
implemented as a composition of these gates. Since every bit operation that
does not use all of the bits performs an even permutation, we need to use at
least one auxiliary bit to perform every permutation, and it is known that one
bit is indeed enough. Without auxiliary bits, all even permutations can be
implemented. We generalize these results to non-binary logic: For any finite
set $A$, a finite gate set can generate all even permutations of $A^n$ for all
$n$, without any auxiliary symbols. This directly implies the previously
published result that a finite gate set can generate all permutations of $A^n$
when the cardinality of $A$ is odd, and that one auxiliary symbol is necessary
and sufficient to obtain all permutations when the cardinality of $A$ is even.
We also consider the conservative case, that is, those permutations of $A^n$
that preserve the weight of the input word. The weight is the vector that
records how many times each symbol occurs in the word or, more generally, the
image of the word under a fixed monoid homomorphism from $A^*$ to a commutative
monoid. It turns out that no finite conservative gate set can, for all $n$,
implement all conservative even permutations of $A^n$ without auxiliary bits.
But we provide a finite gate set that can implement all those conservative
permutations that are even within each weight class of $A^n$.

because of the different propagation conditions. The channels associated with
different transmitreceive pairs can be highly correlated due to the i) high
probability of line-of-sight (LOS) communication between user equipment (UE)
and base station (BS), and ii) insufficient spacing between antenna elements at
both UE and BS. In this paper, we propose a novel transmission technique titled
Diversity Pulse Shaped Transmission (DPST) to enhance the throughput over the
correlated MIMO channels in an ultra-dense small cell network. The fundamental
of DPST is to shape transmit signals at adjacent antennas with distinct
interpolating filters, introducing pulse shaping diversity. In DPST, each
antenna transmits its own data stream with a relative deterministic time
offset-which must be a fraction of the symbol period-with respect to the
adjacent antenna. The delay is interpolated with the pulse shaped signal
generating a virtual MIMO channel that benefits from increased diversity from
the receiver perspective. To extract the diversity, the receiver must operate
in an over-sampled domain and hence a fractionally spaced equaliser (FSE) is
proposed. The joint impact of DPST and FSE helps the receiver to sense a less
correlated channel, eventually enhancing the UE's throughput. Moreover, in
order to minimise the spatial correlation, we aim to optimise the deterministic
fractional delay. Simulation results show that applying DPST to a correlated
channel can approximately enhance the UE throughput by 1.93x and 3.76x in 2x2
and 4x4 MIMO systems, respectively.

is to investigate the uncertainties in nuclear reactions that result from
fitting a given model to elastic-scattering data, as well as to study how these
uncertainties propagate to the inelastic and transfer channels. We use
statistical methods to determine a best fit and create corresponding 95\%
confidence bands. A simple model of the process is fit to elastic-scattering
data and used to predict either inelastic or transfer cross sections. In this
initial work, we assume that our model is correct, and the only uncertainties
come from the variation of the fit parameters. We study a number of reactions
involving neutron and deuteron projectiles with energies in the range of 5-25
MeV/u, on targets with mass $A$=12-208. We investigate the correlations between
the parameters in the fit. The case of deuterons on $^{12}$C is discussed in
detail: the elastic-scattering fit and the prediction of $^{12}$C(d,p)$^{13}$C
transfer angular distributions, using both uncorrelated and correlated $\chi^2$

systematic manner to identify trends. Our work shows that, in many cases, the
correlated $\chi ^2$ functions (in comparison to the uncorrelated $\chi^2$

correlated functions do, however, produce broader confidence bands. Further
optimization may require improvement in the models themselves and/or more

the presence of a steady source, is shown to be controlled by nonlocal
interactions in momentum space, in contrast to the universal
Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectra. Assuming strongly nonlocal interactions, we show
that inelastic processes are dominant in the IR and cause a thermal bath to
form below the forcing scale, as a result of a detailed balance between
radiation and absorption of soft gluons by the hard ones. Above the forcing
scale, the inelastic collision term reduces to an inhomogeneous diffusion-like
equation yielding a spectrum that spreads to the UV as $t^{1/2}$, similarly to
elastic processes. Due to nonlocal interactions the non-universal turbulent
spectrum is not steady and flattens when time goes on toward the thermal
distribution. This analysis is complemented by numerical simulations, where we
observe that in the explored time interval the spectral exponent of the
nonlocal turbulent cascade is close to $-2$ in agreement with simulations of
classical Yang-Mills equations.

applications could utilize properties of hyperuniformity. One of the major
issues for applications of type-II superconductors is how to achieve high
critical currents by preventing the motion or depinning of vortices, so there
is great interest in understanding which pinning site geometries will lead to
the optimal pinning of vortices. Here, using large scale computational
simulations, we show that vortices in a type-II superconductor with a
hyperuniform pinning arrangement exhibit enhanced pinning compared to an equal
number of pinning sites with a purely random arrangement, and that the
enhancement is robust over a wide range of parameters. The stronger pinning
arises in the hyperuniform arrays due to the suppression of pinning density
fluctuations, permitting higher pin occupancy and the reduction of weak links
that lead to easy flow channeling. We also show that in general, in amorphous
vortex states in the presence of either random or hyperuniform pinning arrays,
the vortices themselves exhibit disordered hyperuniformity due to the repulsive
nature of the vortex-vortex interactions.

parsimony, which has been questioned by several authors recently, is helpful in
selecting the best model for forecasting seasonal river flow. Our work also
demonstrates the importance of model adequacy. An adequate model for seasonal
river flow must incorporate seasonal periodic correlation. The usual
autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) and seasonal ARMA models are not adequate
in this respect for seasonal river flow time series. A new diagnostic check,
for detecting periodic correlation in fitted ARMA models is developed in this
paper. This diagnostic check is recommended for routine use when fitting
seasonal ARMA models. It is shown that this diagnostic check indicates that
many seasonal economic time series also exhibit periodic correlation. Since the
standard forecasting methods are inadequate on this account, it can be
concluded that in many cases, the forecasts produced are sub-optimal. Finally,
a limitation of the arbitrary combination of forecasts is also illustrated.
Combining forecasts from an adequate parsimonious model with an inadequate
model did not improve the forecasts whereas combining the two forecasts of two
inadequate models did yield an improvement in forecasting performance. These
findings also support the model building philosophy of Box \& Jenkins. The
non-intuitive findings of Newbold \& Granger (1974) and Winkler \& Makridakis

rather than spontaneously forming grains from a cloud of vapor. Interestingly,
different potential recondensation nuclei have very different propensities to
actually nucleate water ice at the temperatures associated with freeze-out in
protoplanetary discs. Therefore, if a region in a disc is warmed and then
recooled, water vapor should not be expected to refreeze evenly onto all
available grains. Instead it will preferentially recondense onto the most
favorable grains. When the recooling is slow enough, only the most favorable
grains will nucleate ice, allowing them to recondense thick ice mantles. We
quantify the conditions for preferential recondensation to rapidly create
pebble-sized grains in protoplanetary discs and show that FU Orionis type
outbursts have the appropriate cooling rates to drive pebble creation in a band
about 5 astronomical units wide outside of the quiescent frost line from

experiment that ferromagnetic quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in clean metals
are generally first-order due to the coupling of the magnetization to
electronic soft modes, in contrast to the classical analogue that is an
archetypical second-order phase transition. For disordered metals BKV theory
predicts that the second order nature of the QPT is restored because the
electronic soft modes change their nature from ballistic to diffusive. Our
low-temperature magnetization study identifies the ferromagnetic QPT in the
disordered metal UCo$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge as the first clear example that exhibits
the associated critical exponents predicted by BKV theory.

  conference paper at ICLR 2017",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The loss surface of deep neural networks has recently attracted interest in
the optimization and machine learning communities as a prime example of
high-dimensional non-convex problem. Some insights were recently gained using
spin glass models and mean-field approximations, but at the expense of strongly
simplifying the nonlinear nature of the model.
  In this work, we do not make any such assumption and study conditions on the
data distribution and model architecture that prevent the existence of bad
local minima. Our theoretical work quantifies and formalizes two important
\emph{folklore} facts: (i) the landscape of deep linear networks has a
radically different topology from that of deep half-rectified ones, and (ii)
that the energy landscape in the non-linear case is fundamentally controlled by
the interplay between the smoothness of the data distribution and model
over-parametrization. Our main theoretical contribution is to prove that
half-rectified single layer networks are asymptotically connected, and we
provide explicit bounds that reveal the aforementioned interplay.
  The conditioning of gradient descent is the next challenge we address. We
study this question through the geometry of the level sets, and we introduce an
algorithm to efficiently estimate the regularity of such sets on large-scale
networks. Our empirical results show that these level sets remain connected
throughout all the learning phase, suggesting a near convex behavior, but they
become exponentially more curvy as the energy level decays, in accordance to
what is observed in practice with very low curvature attractors.

from multiple sources contributing to some aspect of that problem. The word
fusion has also been used in the literature for such problems involving
disparate data types. Holistically understanding traffic patterns, causes of
accidents, bombings, terrorist planning and many natural phenomenon such as
storms, earthquakes fall into this category. Some may have real-time
requirements and some may need to be analyzed after the fact (post-mortem or
forensic analysis.) What is common for all these problems is that the amount
and types of data associated with the event. Data may also be incomplete and
trustworthiness of sources may also vary. Currently, manual and ad-hoc
approaches are used in aggregating data in different ways for analyzing and
understanding these problems.
  In this paper, we approach this problem in a novel way using multilayered
networks. We identify features of a central event and propose a network layer
for each feature. This approach allows us to study the effect of each feature
independently and its impact on the event. We also establish that the proposed
approach allows us to compose these features in arbitrary ways (without loss of
information) to analyze their combined effect. Additionally, formulation of
relationships (e.g., distance measure for a single feature instead of several
at the same time) is simpler. Further, computations can be done once on each
layer in this approach and reused for mixing and matching the features for
aggregate impacts and ""what if"" scenarios to understand the problem
holistically. This has been demonstrated by recreating the communities for the
AND-Composed network by using the communities of the individual layers.
  We believe that techniques proposed here make an important contribution to
the nascent yet fast growing area of data fusion.

crowds can become ""smarter,"" i.e., more efficient and robust, by partially
following the average opinion. This observation runs counter to the widely
accepted claim that the wisdom of crowds deteriorates with social influence.
The key difference is that individuals are self-interested and hence will
reject feedbacks that do not improve their performance. We propose a
control-theoretic methodology to compute the degree of social influence, i.e.,
the level to which one accepts the population feedback, that optimizes
performance. We conducted an experiment with human subjects ($N = 194$), where
the participants were first asked to solve an optimization problem
independently, i.e., under no social influence. Our theoretical methodology
estimates a $30\%$ degree of social influence to be optimal, resulting in a
$29\%$ improvement in the crowd's performance. We then let the same cohort

plays fundamental role in different topics of modern applied mathematics. For
tensors over any integral domain, we prove that the rank problem is polynomial

domain. Our result gives a complete description of the algorithmic complexity
of tensor rank and allows one to solve several known open problems. In
particular, the tensor rank over $\mathbb{Z}$ turns out to be undecidable,
which answers the question posed by Gonzalez and Ja'Ja' in 1980. We generalize
our result and prove that the symmetric rank admits a similar description of
computational complexity as the one we give for usual rank. In particular,
computing the symmetric rank of a rational tensor is shown to be NP-hard, which
proves a recent conjecture of Hillar and Lim. As a byproduct of our approach,
we get a similar characterization of the algorithmic complexity of the minimal
rank matrix completion problem, which gives a complete answer to the question

eliminates the need to move large photometric datasets outside a database for
redshift estimation, and utilizes the computational capabilities of DB
hardware. The code is able to perform both maximum likelihood and Bayesian
estimation, and can handle inputs of variable photometric filter sets and
corresponding broad-band magnitudes. It is possible to take into account the
full covariance matrix between filters, and filter zero points can be
empirically calibrated using measurements with given redshifts. The list of
spectral templates and the prior can be specified flexibly, and the expensive
synthetic magnitude computations are done via lazy evaluation, coupled with a
caching of results. Parallel execution is fully supported. For large upcoming
photometric surveys such as the LSST, the ability to perform in-place photo-z
calculation would be a significant advantage. Also, the efficient handling of
variable filter sets is a necessity for heterogeneous databases, for example
the Hubble Source Catalog, and for cross-match services such as SkyQuery. We

change in the distribution of stochastic processes has received a great deal of
attention. In particular, a deep connection has been established between
Lorden's minimax approach to change-point detection and the widely used CUSUM
procedure, first for discrete-time processes, and subsequently for some of
their continuous-time counterparts. However, results for processes with jumps
are still scarce, while the practical importance of such processes has
escalated since the turn of the century. In this work we consider the problem
of detecting a change in the distribution of continuous-time processes with
independent and stationary increments, i.e. L\'evy processes, and our main
result shows that CUSUM is indeed optimal in Lorden's sense. This is the most
natural continuous-time analogue of the seminal work of Moustakides for
sequentially observed random variables that are assumed to be i.i.d. before and
after the change-point. From a practical perspective, the approach we adopt is
appealing as it consists in approximating the continuous-time problem by a
suitable sequence of change-point problems with equispaced sampling points, and
for which a CUSUM procedure is shown to be optimal.

the multifractal scenario to quantify the temporal scaling characteristics of
Barkhausen avalanches in polycrystalline and amorphous ferromagnetic films with

primitives. Given a matrix $A\in\mathbb{F}^{N\times N}$ and a vector $b$, it is
known that in the worst case $\Theta(N^2)$ operations over $\mathbb{F}$ are
needed to compute $Ab$. A broad question is to identify classes of structured
dense matrices that can be represented with $O(N)$ parameters, and for which
matrix-vector multiplication can be performed sub-quadratically. One such class
of structured matrices is the orthogonal polynomial transforms, whose rows
correspond to a family of orthogonal polynomials. Other well known classes
include the Toeplitz, Hankel, Vandermonde, Cauchy matrices and their extensions
that are all special cases of a ldisplacement rank property. In this paper, we
make progress on two fronts:
  1. We introduce the notion of recurrence width of matrices. For matrices with
constant recurrence width, we design algorithms to compute $Ab$ and $A^Tb$ with
a near-linear number of operations. This notion of width is finer than all the
above classes of structured matrices and thus we can compute multiplication for
all of them using the same core algorithm.
  2. We additionally adapt this algorithm to an algorithm for a much more
general class of matrices with displacement structure: those with low
displacement rank with respect to quasiseparable matrices. This class includes
Toeplitz-plus-Hankel-like matrices, Discrete Cosine/Sine Transforms, and more,
and captures all previously known matrices with displacement structure that we
are aware of under a unified parametrization and algorithm.
  Our work unifies, generalizes, and simplifies existing state-of-the-art
results in structured matrix-vector multiplication. Finally, we show how
applications in areas such as multipoint evaluations of multivariate
polynomials can be reduced to problems involving low recurrence width matrices.

patterns to a storage thereby preventing privacy leakage. So far in the current
literature, only `fully functional' ORAMs are widely studied which can protect,
at a cost of considerable performance penalty, against the strong adversaries
who can monitor all read and write operations. However, recent research has
shown that information can still be leaked even if only the write access
pattern (not reads) is visible to the adversary. For such weaker adversaries, a
fully functional ORAM turns out to be an overkill causing unnecessary
overheads. Instead, a simple `write-only' ORAM is sufficient, and, more
interestingly, is preferred as it can offer far more performance and energy
efficiency than a fully functional ORAM.
  In this work, we present Flat ORAM: an efficient write-only ORAM scheme which
outperforms the closest existing write-only ORAM called HIVE. HIVE suffers from
performance bottlenecks while managing the memory occupancy information vital
for correctness of the protocol. Flat ORAM resolves these bottlenecks by
introducing a simple idea of Occupancy Map (OccMap) which efficiently manages
the memory occupancy information resulting in far better performance. Our
simulation results show that, on average, Flat ORAM only incurs a moderate
slowdown of $3\times$ over the insecure DRAM for memory intensive benchmarks
among Splash2 and $1.6\times$ for SPEC06. Compared to HIVE, Flat ORAM offers
$50\%$ performance gain on average and up to $80\%$ energy savings.

delivery network, where each user is equipped with a cache memory, not
necessarily of equal capacity. Cache memories are filled in advance during the
off-peak traffic period in a decentralized manner, i.e., without the knowledge
of the number of active users, their identities, or their particular demands.
User demands are revealed during the peak traffic period, and are served
simultaneously through an error-free shared link. The goal is to find the
minimum delivery rate during the peak traffic period that is sufficient to
satisfy all possible demand combinations. A group-based decentralized caching
and coded delivery scheme is proposed, and it is shown to improve upon the
state-of-the-art in terms of the minimum required delivery rate when there are
more users in the system than files. Numerical results indicate that the
improvement is more significant as the cache capacities of the users become
more skewed. A new lower bound on the delivery rate is also presented, which
provides a tighter bound than the classical cut-set bound.

in the sub-eV range with very weak couplings to ordinary matter which can
possess spin-dependent couplings to electrons and nucleons. Present laboratory
constraints on exotic spin-dependent interactions with pseudoscalar and axial
couplings for exchange boson masses between meV and eV are very poor compared
to constraints on spin-independent interactions in the same mass range arising
from spin-0 and spin-1 boson exchange. It is therefore interesting to analyze
in a general way how one can use the strong experimental bounds on
spin-independent interactions to also constrain spin-dependent interactions by
considering higher-order exchange processes. The exchange of a pair of bosons
between two fermions with spin-dependent couplings will possess contributions
which flip spins twice and thereby generate a polarization-independent
interaction energy which can add coherently between two unpolarized objects. In
this paper we derive the dominant long-range contributions to the interaction
energy between two nonrelativistic spin-1/2 Dirac fermions from double exchange
of spin-0 and spin-1 bosons proportional to couplings of the form $g_P^{4}$,
$g_S^{2}g_P^{2}$, and $g_V^{2}g_A^{2}$. Our results for $g_P^{4}$ are in
agreement with previous calculations that have appeared in the literature. We
demonstrate the usefulness of this analysis to constrain spin-dependent
couplings by presenting the results of a reanalysis of data from a short-range
gravity experiment to derive an improved constraint on $(g^N_{P})^2$, the
pseudoscalar coupling for nucleons, in the range between $40$ and $200~\mu$m of
about a factor of 5 compared to previous limits. The spin-independent
contribution from 2-boson exchange with axial-vector couplings requires special
treatment and will be explored in another paper.

been recently proposed as a promising technology to meet the capacity crunch of
next generation cellular networks. However, due to the high mobility of
cellular devices, establishing and ensuring the success of D2D transmission
becomes a major challenge. To this end, in this paper, a novel framework is
proposed to enable devices to form multi-hop D2D connections in an effort to
maintain sustainable communication in the presence of device mobility. To solve
the problem posed by device mobility, in contrast to existing works, which
mostly focus on physical domain information, a durable community based approach
is introduced taking social encounters into context. It is shown that the
proposed scheme can derive an optimal solution for time sensitive content
transmission while also minimizing the cost that the base station pays in order
to incentivize users to participate in D2D. Simulation results show that the
proposed social community aware approach yields significant performance gain,
in terms of the amount of traffic offloaded from the cellular network to the
D2D tier, compared to the classical social-unaware methods.

step of our method involves reconstructing the dynamics in a reduced-order

allows for reconstruction of the vector field and more importantly, estimation
of local uncertainty. The latter is due to i) local interpolation error and ii)
truncation of the high-dimensional phase space. This uncertainty component can
be analytically quantified in terms of the GPR hyperparameters. In the second
step we formulate stochastic models that explicitly take into account the
reconstructed dynamics and their uncertainty. For regions of the attractor
which are not sufficiently sampled for our GPR framework to be effective, an
adaptive blended scheme is formulated to enforce correct statistical steady
state properties, matching those of the real data. We examine the effectiveness
of the proposed method to complex systems including the Lorenz 96, the

of work has focused on near-frontal faces. Algorithms typically break down on
profile faces, or are too slow for real-time applications. In this work we
propose an efficient approach to face alignment that can handle 180 degrees of
head rotation in a unified way (e.g., without resorting to view-based models)
using 2D training data. The foundation of our approach is cascaded shape
regression (CSR), which has emerged recently as the leading strategy. We
propose a generalization of conventional CSRs that we call branching cascaded
regression (BCR). Conventional CSRs are single-track; that is, they progress
from one cascade level to the next in a straight line, with each regressor
attempting to fit the entire dataset. We instead split the regression problem
into two or more simpler ones after each cascade level. Intuitively, each
regressor can then operate on a simpler objective function (i.e., with fewer
conflicting gradient directions). Within the BCR framework, we model and infer
pose-related landmark visibility and face shape simultaneously using Structured
Point Distribution Models (SPDMs). We propose to learn task-specific feature
mapping functions that are adaptive to landmark visibility, and that use SPDM
parameters as regression targets instead of 2D landmark coordinates.
Additionally, we introduce a new in-the-wild dataset of profile faces to
validate our approach.

mutations, as extended to structured populations by Lieberman et al.\ (Nature,
2005). In this process, individuals are the vertices of a connected graph $G$.
Initially, there is a single mutant vertex, chosen uniformly at random. In each
step, a random vertex is selected for reproduction with a probability
proportional to its fitness: mutants have fitness $r>1$, while non-mutants have
fitness 1. The vertex chosen to reproduce places a copy of itself to a
uniformly random neighbor in $G$, replacing the individual that was there. The
process ends when the mutation either reaches fixation (i.e., all vertices are
mutants), or gets extinct. The principal quantity of interest is the
probability with which each of the two outcomes occurs.
  A problem that has received significant attention recently concerns the
existence of families of graphs, called strong amplifiers of selection, for
which the fixation probability tends to 1 as the order $n$ of the graph
increases, and the existence of strong suppressors of selection, for which this
probability tends to 0. For the case of directed graphs, it is known that both
strong amplifiers and suppressors exist. For the case of undirected graphs,
however, the problem has remained open, and the general belief has been that
neither strong amplifiers nor suppressors exist. In this paper we disprove this
belief, by providing the first examples of such graphs. The strong amplifier we
present has fixation probability $1-\tilde O(n^{-1/3})$, and the strong
suppressor has fixation probability $\tilde O(n^{-1/4})$. Both graph
constructions are surprisingly simple. We also prove a general upper bound of
$1-\tilde \Omega(n^{-1/3})$ on the fixation probability of any undirected
graph. Hence, our strong amplifier is existentially optimal.

the absence of negative samples. We further show that the use of the penalized

(CNNs) can be prohibitive for exploiting these models over low-power or
embedded devices. This paper reduces the computational complexity of the CNNs
by minimizing an objective function, including the recognition loss that is
augmented with a sparsity-promoting penalty term. The sparsity structure of the
network is identified using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM), which is widely used in large optimization problems. This method
alternates between promoting the sparsity of the network and optimizing the
recognition performance, which allows us to exploit the two-part structure of
the corresponding objective functions. In particular, we take advantage of the
separability of the sparsity-inducing penalty functions to decompose the
minimization problem into sub-problems that can be solved sequentially.
Applying our method to a variety of state-of-the-art CNN models, our proposed
method is able to simplify the original model, generating models with less
computation and fewer parameters, while maintaining and often improving
generalization performance. Accomplishments on a variety of models strongly
verify that our proposed ADMM-based method can be a very useful tool for
simplifying and improving deep CNNs.

advection-diffusion equations (ADEs). Using a set of cubic trigonometric
B-splines as test functions, a differential quadrature (DQ) method is firstly
proposed for the 1D and 2D time-fractional ADEs of order $(0,1]$. The weighted
coefficients are determined, and with them, the original equation is
transformed into a group of general ordinary differential equations (ODEs),
which are discretized by an effective difference scheme or Runge-Kutta method.
The stability is investigated under a mild theoretical condition. Secondly,
based on a set of cubic B-splines, we develop a new Crank-Nicolson type DQ
method for the 2D space-fractional ADEs without advection. The DQ
approximations to fractional derivatives are introduced and the values of the
fractional derivatives of B-splines are computed by deriving explicit formulas.
The presented DQ methods are evaluated on five benchmark problems and the
concrete simulations of the unsteady propagation of solitons and Gaussian
pulse. In comparison with the existing algorithms in the open literature,
numerical results finally illustrate the validity and accuracy.

present LipNet, a model that maps a variable-length sequence of video frames to

connectionist temporal classification loss, trained entirely end-to-end. To the
best of our knowledge, LipNet is the first end-to-end sentence-level lipreading

orthogonal trajectories to isovels, along which there is no shear stress, we
divide the channel cross section into three major subsections, namely bed area,
walls area, and shared area. The geometry of each subsection is derived given
the location of the maximum velocity. The share of the bed and wall shear
forces from the shared area, are calculated afterward. The results for bed and
walls shear forces agree well with the experimental data with an average
relative error less than 5% for both regular flows and flows carrying suspended
sediment. This method also provides a physics-driven range for the wall and bed
shear forces which nicely covers the experimental data.

bulk viscosity coefficient. We obtain the following conclusions: the value of
traversal velocity decreases for decreasing bulk viscosity, and the traversal
velocity for a traveler depends on not only the wormhole geometry but also the
effects of cosmological background evolution; the null energy condition will be
violated more clearly when the bulk viscosity or the cosmic expansion velocity
decreases; for the case of a positive surface energy density, the range of the
junction radius decreases and the values of the parameter $\lambda$ are further
restricted when the throat radius of the wormhole $r_0/M$ increases, bulk
viscosity coefficient $\zeta_0$ decreases and present-day Hubble parameter

high-resolution spectrum shows that carbon is $>2$ dex subsolar, iron is
approximately solar and all other elements heavier than argon are at least 2 --
4 dex overabundant, including germanium, yttrium and lead. Approximately 150
lines in the blue-optical spectrum remain unidentified. The chemical structure

transition (PT) leading to gravitational waves (GW) potentially observable at
aLIGO and simultaneously stabilize the electroweak vacuum. aLIGO (O5) is
potentially sensitive to cosmological PTs at $10^7$-$10^8$ GeV, which coincides
with the requirement that the singlet scale is less than the Standard Model
(SM) vacuum instability scale, which is between $10^8$ GeV and $10^{14}$ GeV.
After sampling its parameter space, we identify three benchmark points with a
PT at about $T\approx 10^7$ GeV in a gauge singlet extension of the SM. We
calculate the nucleation temperature, order parameter, characteristic
timescale, and peak amplitude and frequency of GW from bubble collisions during
the PT for the benchmarks and find that, in an optimistic scenario, GW from
such a PT may be in reach of aLIGO (O5). We confirm that the singlet stabilizes
the electroweak vacuum whilst remaining consistent with zero-temperature
phenomenology as well. Thus, this scenario presents an intriguing possibility
that aLIGO may detect traces of fundamental physics motivated by vacuum
stability at an energy scale that is well above the reach of any other
experiment.

origin and control is becoming increasingly important field of research, as
they limit the coherence of the system and its ability to approach a fully
ordered state. Here, we present dissipative topological defects in a 1-D ring
network of phase-locked lasers, and show how their formation is related to the
Kibble-Zurek mechanism and is governed in a universal manner by two competing
time scales of the lasers, namely the phase locking time and synchronization
time of their amplitude fluctuations. The ratio between these two time scales
depends on the system parameters such as gain and coupling strength, and thus
offers the possibility to control the probability of topological defects in the
system. Enabling the system to dissipate to the fully ordered, defect-free
state can be exploited for solving hard combinatorial optimization problems in
various fields. As opposed to unitary systems where quenching is obtained via
external cooling mostly through the edges, our dissipative system is kept
strictly uniform even for fast quenches.

$n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M^n,g)$ with strong bounded geometry, as
in Definition $2.3$, involving the scalar curvature function. Namely in strong
bounded geometry, if the supremum of scalar curvature function $S_g<n(n-1)k_0$
for some $k_0\in\mathbb{R}$, then for small volumes the isoperimetric profile
of $(M^n,g)$ is less then or equal to the isoperimetric profile of
$\mathbb{M}^n_{k_0}$ the complete simply connected space form of constant
sectional curvature $k_0$. This work generalizes Theorem $2$ of [Dru02b] in
which the same result was proved in the case where $(M^n, g)$ is assumed to be
just compact. As a consequence of our result we give an asymptotic expansion in
Puiseux's series up to the second nontrivial term of the isoperimetric profile
function for small volumes. Finally, as a corollary of our isoperimetric
comparison result, it is shown, in the special case of manifolds with strong
bounded geometry, and $S_g<n(n-1)k_0$ that for small volumes the
Aubin-Cartan-Hadamard's Conjecture in any dimension $n$ is true.

problems, they will need to be able to represent their own uncertainty.
Modeling uncertainty is one of the key features of Bayesian methods. Using
Bernoulli dropout with sampling at prediction time has recently been proposed
as an efficient and well performing variational inference method for DNNs.
However, sampling from other multiplicative noise based variational
distributions has not been investigated in depth. We evaluated Bayesian DNNs
trained with Bernoulli or Gaussian multiplicative masking of either the units
(dropout) or the weights (dropconnect). We tested the calibration of the
probabilistic predictions of Bayesian convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on
MNIST and CIFAR-10. Sampling at prediction time increased the calibration of
the DNNs' probabalistic predictions. Sampling weights, whether Gaussian or
Bernoulli, led to more robust representation of uncertainty compared to
sampling of units. However, using either Gaussian or Bernoulli dropout led to
increased test set classification accuracy. Based on these findings we used
both Bernoulli dropout and Gaussian dropconnect concurrently, which we show
approximates the use of a spike-and-slab variational distribution without
increasing the number of learned parameters. We found that spike-and-slab
sampling had higher test set performance than Gaussian dropconnect and more
robustly represented its uncertainty compared to Bernoulli dropout.

of vocal intonations. Reciprocal interactions between superior temporal (STG)
and inferior frontal gyri (IFG) have been shown to anchor a neural network for
prosodic comprehension, which we refer to as the Prosody Neural Network (PNN).
Although the amygdala is critical for socio-emotional processing, its integral
functional and structural role in processing social information from speech
prosody as well as its role in the PNN is largely unexplored including
inconsistent recent empirical findings. Here, we used magnetoencephalography
and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging of white-matter pathways to establish
that the PNN is characterized by (1) a robust amygdala-cortical functional
connectivity that dynamically evolves as prosodic interpretation progresses,
(2) direct structural fiber connections between amygdala and STG/IFG traversing
a ventral white-matter pathway, and (3) robust amygdala-insula functional
connectivity and structural insula fiber projections to arcuate STG-IFG
connections. These findings support a role for functional and structural
amygdala-centric ventral pathways in combining speech features to form prosodic
percepts. They also highlight insula contributions to prosodic comprehension,
potentially via vertical integration of amygdala-centric ventral processing
into dorsal pathways responsible for prosodic motor articulation and speech
planning.

  Two-Connected Directed Steiner Tree",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study a survivable network design problem on directed
graphs, 2-Connected Directed Steiner Tree (2-DST): given an $n$-vertex weighted
directed graph, a root $r$, and a set of $h$ terminals $S$, find a min-cost
subgraph $H$ that has two edge/vertex disjoint paths from $r$ to any $t\in S$.
2-DST is a natural generalization of the classical Directed Steiner Tree
problem (DST), where we have an additional requirement that the network must
tolerate one failure. No non-trivial approximation is known for 2-DST. This was
left as an open problem by Feldman et al., [SODA'09; JCSS] and has then been
studied by Cheriyan et al. [SODA'12; TALG] and Laekhanukit SODA'14]. However,
no positive result was known except for the special case of a $D$-shallow
instance [Laekhanukit, ICALP'16].
  We present an $O(D^3\log D\cdot h^{2/D}\cdot \log n)$ approximation algorithm
for 2-DST that runs in time $O(n^{O(D)})$, for any $D\in[\log_2h]$. This
implies a polynomial-time $O(h^\epsilon \log n)$ approximation for any constant
$\epsilon>0$, and a poly-logarithmic approximation running in quasi-polynomial
time. We remark that this is essentially the best-known even for the classical
DST, and the latter problem is $O(\log^{2-\epsilon}n)$-hard to approximate
[Halperin and Krauthgamer, STOC'03]. As a by product, we obtain an algorithm
with the same approximation guarantee for the $2$-Connected Directed Steiner
Subgraph problem, where the goal is to find a min-cost subgraph such that every
pair of terminals are $2$-edge/vertex connected.

$SATP_{LP}$ polytopes, with $BQP_{LP}$ being projection of the $SATP_{LP}$ face
(and $BQP$ -- projection of the $SATP$ face). We consider a problem of integer
recognition: determine whether a maximum of a linear objective function is
achieved at an integral vertex of a polytope. Various special instances of
3-SAT problem like NAE-3-SAT, 1-in-3-SAT, weighted MAX-3-SAT, and others can be
solved by integer recognition over $SATP_{LP}$. We describe all integral
vertices of $SATP_{LP}$. Like $BQP_{LP}$, polytope $SATP_{LP}$ has the
Trubin-property being quasi-integral (1-skeleton of $SATP$ is a subset of
1-skeleton of $SATP_{LP}$). However, unlike $BQP$, not all vertices of $SATP$
are pairwise adjacent, the diameter of $SATP$ equals 2, and the clique number
of 1-skeleton is superpolynomial in dimension. It is known that the fractional
vertices of $BQP_{LP}$ are half-integer (0, 1 or 1/2 valued). We show that the
denominators of $SATP_{LP}$ fractional vertices can take any integral value.
Finally, we describe polynomially solvable subproblems of integer recognition
over $SATP_{LP}$ with constrained objective functions. Based on that, we solve
some cases of edge constrained bipartite graph coloring.

attempts to identify $x$ using as few Yes/No queries as possible, on average.
  An optimal strategy for the ""20 questions"" game is given by a Huffman code

strategy finds $x$ using fewer than $H(\pi)+1$ questions on average. However,
the questions asked by Bob could be arbitrary. In this paper, we investigate
the following question: Are there restricted sets of questions that match the
performance of Huffman codes, either exactly or approximately?
  Our first main result shows that for every distribution $\pi$, Bob has a
strategy that uses only questions of the form ""$x < c$?"" and ""$x = c$?"", and
uncovers $x$ using at most $H(\pi)+1$ questions on average, matching the

image of a linearized Hopf monoid $\bf H$. That is, $H={\mathcal K} ({\bf H})$
or $H=\overline{\mathcal K} ({\bf H})$. Unlike the functor $\overline{\mathcal
K}$, the functor ${\mathcal K}$ applied to ${\bf H}$ may not preserve the
antipode of ${\bf H}$. In this case, one needs to consider the larger Hopf
monoid ${\bf L}\times{\bf H}$ to get $H={\mathcal K} ({\bf
H})=\overline{\mathcal K}({\bf L}\times{\bf H})$ and study the antipode in
${\bf L}\times{\bf H}$. One of the main results in this paper provides a
cancelation free and multiplicity free formula for the antipode of ${\bf
L}\times{\bf H}$. From this formula we obtain a new antipode formula for $H$.
We also explore the case when ${\bf H}$ is commutative and cocommutative. In
this situation we get new antipode formulas that despite of not being
cancelation free, can be used to obtain one for $\overline{\mathcal K}({\bf
H})$ in some cases. We recover as well many of the well-known cancelation free
formulas in the literature. One of our formulas for computing the antipode in
${\bf H}$ involves acyclic orientations of hypergraphs as the central tool. In
this vein, we obtain polynomials analogous to the chromatic polynomial of a
graph, and also identities parallel to Stanley's (-1)-color theorem. One of our
examples introduces a {\it chromatic} polynomial for permutations which counts
increasing sequences of the permutation satisfying a pattern. We also study the
statistic obtained after evaluating such polynomial at $-1$. Finally, we sketch
$q$ deformations and geometric interpretations of our results. This last part
will appear in a sequel paper in joint work with J. Machacek.

Despite the relationship between scientific discovery and biomedical

innovation can be difficult and is largely based solely on the opinions of
subject matter experts. Here, we consider whether a new class of citation
algorithms that identify seminal scientific works in a field, Reference

connections between innovation (e.g. therapeutic treatments) and the
foundational research underlying them. Specifically, we assess whether the
results of these analytic techniques converge with expert opinions on research
milestones driving biomedical innovation in the treatment of Basal Cell
Carcinoma. Our results show that these algorithms successfully identify the

thereby validating the power of these algorithms to converge on independent

advances offer an opportunity to identify scientific activities enabling

the homology hypothesis for virial mass determination in massive ellipticals

trees, starting with compact progenitors of different structural concentrations
(S\'ersic indices n), show that galaxy growth has little dependence on the
initial S\'ersic index (larger n leads to slightly larger size growth), and
depends more on other particulars of the merger history. We show that the
deposition of accreted matter in the outer parts leads to a systematic and
predictable breaking of the homology between remnants and progenitors, which we
characterize through the evolution, during the course of the merger history, of
virial coefficients K = GM/Re \sigma^2 associated to the most commonly-used
dynamical and stellar mass parameters. The virial coefficient for the luminous
mass, K , is about 50 per cent larger at the z = 2 start of the merger
evolution than in z = 0 remnants. Ignoring virial evolution leads to biased
virial mass estimates. We provide K corresponding to a variety of dynamical and
stellar mass parameters, and provide recipes for the dynamical determination of
galaxy masses. For massive, non-compact ellipticals, the popular expression M =
5 Re \sigma^2 / G underestimates the dynamical mass within the luminous body by
factors of up to 4; it instead provides an approximation to the total stellar
mass with smaller uncertainty than current stellar population models.

of the principal challenges in computational physics. The optimal prediction
framework of Chorin et al., which is a reformulation of the Mori-Zwanzig (M-Z)
formalism of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, provides a methodology for
the development of mathematically-derived reduced models of dynamical systems.
Several promising models have emerged from the optimal prediction community and
have found application in molecular dynamics and turbulent flows. In this work,
a new M-Z-based closure model that addresses some of the deficiencies of
existing methods is developed. The model is constructed by exploiting
similarities between two levels of coarse-graining via the Germano identity of
fluid mechanics and by assuming that memory effects have a finite temporal
support. The appeal of the proposed model, which will be referred to as the
`dynamic-MZ-$\tau$' model, is that it is parameter-free and has a structural
form imposed by the mathematics of the coarse-graining process (rather than the
phenomenological assumptions made by the modeler, such as in classical subgrid
scale models). To promote the applicability of M-Z models in general, two
procedures are presented to compute the resulting model form, helping to bypass
the tedious error-prone algebra that has proven to be a hindrance to the
construction of M-Z-based models for complex dynamical systems. While the new
formulation is applicable to the solution of general partial differential
equations, demonstrations are presented in the context of Large Eddy Simulation
closures for Burgers equation, decaying homogeneous turbulence, and turbulent
channel flow. The performance of the model and validity of the underlying
assumptions are investigated in detail.

question with applications in many disciplines. Ecologists have long sought to
account for the patterns observed in species-abundance distributions (the
number of individuals per species found in some sample), and computer
scientists study the distribution of files per directory. Is there a universal
statistical distribution describing how many items are typically found in each
category in large taxonomies? Here, we analyze a wide array of large,
real-world datasets -- including items lost and found on the New York City
transit system, library books, and a bacterial microbiome -- and discover such
an underlying commonality. A simple, non-parametric branching model that
randomly categorizes items and takes as input only the total number of items

distributions in these datasets. This result may shed light on patterns in
species-abundance distributions long observed in ecology. The model also
predicts the number of taxonomic categories that remain unrepresented in a
