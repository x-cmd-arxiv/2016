non-vanishing temperature are presented and compared to lattice results. It is
found that the three-gluon vertex is enhanced for temperatures below the phase
transition. At very low momenta it becomes negative for all temperatures.
Furthermore, truncation effects in functional equations are discussed at the
example of three-dimensional Yang-Mills theory for which a self-contained
solution is presented.

it has a lower bound on its Ricci curvature and a positive lower bound on its
volume. We prove that such coarse local geometric control must persist for a
definite amount of time under three-dimensional Ricci flow, and leads to local
C/t decay of the full curvature tensor, irrespective of what is happening
beyond the local region.
  As a by-product, our results generalise the Pseudolocality theorem of
Perelman and Tian-Wang in this dimension by not requiring the Ricci curvature
to be almost-positive, and not asking the volume growth to be almost-Euclidean.

propagation exist, then the matter effect is modified and the modification is
parametrized by the dimensionless parameter
$\epsilon_{\alpha\beta}~(\alpha,\beta=e, \mu, \tau)$. In this paper we discuss
the sensitivity of the T2HKK experiment, whose possibility is now seriously
discussed as a future extension of the T2K experiment, to such NSI. On the
assumption that $\epsilon_{\alpha\mu}=0~(\alpha=e, \mu\tau)$ and
$\epsilon_{\tau\tau}=|\epsilon_{e\tau}|/(1+\epsilon_{ee})$, which are satisfied
by other experiments to a good approximation, we find that, among the possible
off-axis flux configurations of $1.3^\circ$, $1.5^\circ$, $2.0^\circ$ and
$2.5^\circ$, the case of the off-axis angle $1.3^\circ$ gives the highest
sensitivity to $\epsilon_{ee}$ and $|\epsilon_{e\tau}|$. Our results show that
the $1.3^\circ$ off-axis configuration can exclude NSI for
$|\epsilon_{ee}|\gtrsim 1$ or $|\epsilon_{e\tau}|\gtrsim 0.2$ at 3$\sigma$. We
also find that in the presence of NSI, T2HKK (for the off-axis angle
$1.3^\circ$) has better sensitivity to the two CP phases ($\delta_{CP}$ and
arg($\epsilon_{e \tau}$)) than DUNE. This is because of the synergy between the
two detectors i.e., one at Kamioka and one at Korea. T2HKK has better
sensitivity to the CP phases than the atmospheric neutrino experiment at
Hyperkamiokande in inverted hierarchy, but in normal hierarchy the atmospheric
neutrino experiment has the best sensitivity to the CP phases.

$r=r(G,m)$ such that for any balanced $r$-colouring of the vertices of $G$ one
can find an independent set which meets at least $m$ colour classes in a set of

of $r(H_n,m)$ (using Ramsey-numbers for finite digraphs), where $H_n$ is
Henson's countable universal homogeneous $K_n$-free graph. In turn, we deduce a
new partition property of $H_n$ regarding balanced embeddings of bipartite
graphs: for any finite bipartite $G$ with bipartition $A,B$, if the vertices of
$H_n$ are partitioned into two infinite classes then there is an induced copy
of $G$ in $H_n$ such that the images of $A$ and $B$ are contained in different

TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$. The data are
analyzed under three hypotheses: (i) mixing assuming $C\!P$ symmetry, (ii)
mixing assuming no direct $C\!P$ violation in the Cabibbo-favored or doubly
Cabibbo-suppressed decay amplitudes, and (iii) mixing allowing either direct
$C\!P$ violation and/or $C\!P$ violation in the superpositions of flavor
eigenstates defining the mass eigenstates. The data are also combined with
those from a previous LHCb study of $D^0\to K \pi$ decays from a disjoint set
of $ D^{*+} $ candidates produced directly in $pp$ collisions. In all cases,
the data are consistent with the hypothesis of $C\!P$ symmetry.

applications, including photocatalytic water splitting. Following the first
demonstration of this phenomenon 40 years ago there have been numerous studies

an atomic-level understanding of the water-TiO2 interaction. However, nearly
all of the previous studies of water/TiO2 interfaces involve water in the
vapour phase. Here, we explore the interfacial structure between liquid water
and a rutile TiO2(110) surface pre-characterized at the atomic level. Scanning
tunnelling microscopy and surface X-ray diffraction are used to determine the
structure, which is comprised of an ordered array of hydroxyl molecules with
molecular water in the second layer. Static and dynamic density functional
theory calculations suggest that a possible mechanism for formation of the
hydroxyl overlayer involves the mixed adsorption of O2 and H2O on a partially
defected surface. The quantitative structural properties derived here provide a
basis with which to explore the atomistic properties and hence mechanisms
involved in TiO2 photocatalysis.

fluid flow in a two-dimensional inhomogeneous porous media. The permeability of
the porous medium is described by a step function, with a jump discontinuity
across the fixed-in-time curve $(x_1,-1+f(x_1))$, while the interface
separating the fluid from the vacuum region is given by the time-dependent
curve $(x_1,h(x_1,t))$. Our estimates are based on a new methodology that
relies upon a careful study of the PDE system, coupling Darcy's law and
incompressibility of the fluid, rather than the analysis of the singular
integral contour equation for the interface function $h$. We are able to
develop an existence theory for any initial interface given by $h_0 \in H^2$
and any permeability curve-of-discontinuity that is given by $f \in H^{2.5}$.
In particular, our method allows for both curves to have (pointwise) unbounded
curvature. In the case that the permeability discontinuity is the set $f=0$, we
prove global existence and decay to equilibrium for small initial data. This
decay is obtained using a new energy-energy dissipation inequality that couples
tangential derivatives of the velocity in the bulk of the fluid with the
curvature of the interface. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
global existence result for the Muskat problem with discontinuous permeability.

illustrate this point by studying surface spin-waves in magnetic bilayer films

non-reciprocity effects, where counter-propagative spin-waves have different

of GeV/nuc. The distribution of local sources of primary cosmic rays has been
suggested as a potential solution to this puzzling behavior. Some authors even
claim that a single source is responsible for the observed anomalies. But how
probable these explanations are? To answer that question, our current
description of cosmic ray Galactic propagation needs to be replaced by the
Myriad model. In the former approach, sources of protons and helium nuclei are
treated as a jelly continuously spread over space and time. A more accurate
description is provided by the Myriad model where sources are considered as
point-like events. This leads to a probabilistic derivation of the fluxes of
primary species, and opens the possibility that larger-than-average values may
be observed at the Earth. For a long time though, a major obstacle has been the
infinite variance associated to the probability distribution function which the
fluxes follow. Several suggestions have been made to cure this problem but none
is entirely satisfactory. We go a step further here and solve the infinite
variance problem of the Myriad model by making use of the generalized central
limit theorem. We find that primary fluxes are distributed according to a
stable law with heavy tail, well-known to financial analysts. The probability
that the proton and helium anomalies are sourced by local SNR can then be
calculated. The p-values associated to the CREAM measurements turn out to be
small, unless somewhat unrealistic propagation parameters are assumed.

proposed in these contexts, no systematic study has been conducted on the
selection of a robust metric for quality assessment. This article addresses the
question: what is the best metric to assess the quality of a reconstructed
image? It starts by considering several metrics, and selecting a few based on
general properties. Then, a variety of image reconstruction cases is
considered. The observational scenarios are phase closure and phase referencing
at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), for a combination of two,
three, four and six telescopes. End-to-end image reconstruction is accomplished
with the MiRA software, and several merit functions are put to test. It is
found that convolution by an effective point spread function is required for
proper image quality assessment. The effective angular resolution of the images
is superior to naive expectation based on the maximum frequency sampled by the
array. This is due to the prior information used in the aperture synthesis
algorithm and to the nature of the objects considered. The l1 norm is the most
robust of all considered metrics, because being linear it is less sensitive to
image smoothing by high regularisation levels. For the cases considered, this
metric allows the implementation of automatic quality assessment of
reconstructed images, with a performance similar to human selection.

we derive expressions for the downlink coverage probability of relay-assisted

mmWave or uplink microwave bands. We further investigate the spectral
efficiency (SE) improvement in the cellular downlink, and the effect of D2D

improved using two-hop D2D relaying. Specifically, microwave D2D relays achieve
better coverage because D2D connections can be established under NLOS

$n$-component $|\varphi|^4$ lattice spin model. For $n =0$, we study the weakly
self-avoiding walk via an exact representation as a supersymmetric spin model.
These models have upper critical dimension $d_c=2\alpha$. For dimensions
$d=1,2,3$ and small $\epsilon>0$, we choose $\alpha = \frac 12 (d+\epsilon)$,
so that $d=d_c-\epsilon$ is below the upper critical dimension. For small
$\epsilon$ and weak coupling, to order $\epsilon$ we prove existence of and
compute the values of the critical exponent $\gamma$ for the susceptibility
(for $n \ge 0$) and the critical exponent $\alpha_H$ for the specific heat (for
$n \ge 1$). For the susceptibility, $\gamma = 1 + \frac{n+2}{n+8} \frac
\epsilon\alpha + O(\epsilon^2)$, and a similar result is proved for the
specific heat. Expansion in $\epsilon$ for such long-range models was first
carried out in the physics literature in 1972. Our proof adapts and applies a
rigorous renormalisation group method developed in previous papers with
Bauerschmidt and Brydges for the nearest-neighbour models in the critical

analyse a 3D MHD model of the solar corona in an emerging active region with
the focus on the structure of the forming coronal loops. The lower boundary of
this simulation is taken from a model of an emerging active region. As a
consequence of the emerging magnetic flux and the horizontal motions at the
surface a coronal loop forms self-consistently. We investigate the current
density along magnetic field inside (and outside) this loop and study the
magnetic and plasma properties in and around it. We find that the total current
along the loop changes its sign from being antiparallel to parallel to the
magnetic field. This is caused by the inclination of the loop together with the
footpoint motion. Around the loop the currents form a complex non-force-free
helical structure. This is directly related to a bipolar current structure at
the loop footpoints at the base of the corona and a local reduction of the
background magnetic field (i.e. outside the loop) caused by the plasma flow
into and along the loop. The locally reduced magnetic pressure in the loop
allows the loop to sustain a higher density, which is crucial for the emission
in extreme UV. The acting of the flow on the magnetic field hosting the loop
turns out to be also responsible for the observed squashing of the loop. The
complex magnetic field and current system surrounding it can be modeled only in
3D MHD models where the magnetic field has to balance the plasma pressure. A 1D
coronal loop model or a force-free extrapolation can not capture the current
system and the complex interaction of the plasma and the magnetic field in the
coronal loop, despite the fact that the loop is under low-$\beta$ conditions.

Dynamically, it is important because of its interaction with the ${\nu}_{1C}$
nodal secular resonance with Ceres, that significantly increases the dispersion
in inclination of family members at lower semi-major axis. As an effect, the
distribution of inclination values of the Hoffmeister family at semi-major axis
lower than its center is significantly leptokurtic, and this can be used to set
constraints on the terminal ejection velocity field of the family at the time
it was produced. By performing an analysis of the time behaviour of the
kurtosis of the $v_W$ component of the ejection velocity field
(${\gamma}_2(v_W)$), as obtained from Gauss' equations, for different
fictitious Hoffmeister families with different values of the ejection velocity
field, we were able to exclude that the Hoffmeister family should be older than
335 Myr. Constraints from the currently observed inclination distribution of
the Hoffmeister family suggest that its terminal ejection velocity parameter
$V_{EJ}$ should be lower than 25~m/s. Results of a Yarko-YORP Monte Carlo
method to family dating, combined with other constraints from inclinations and
${\gamma}_2(v_W)$, indicate that the Hoffmeister family should be

cyclic deformations. More interestingly, in the limit of rapid cycles, the
amount of deviation, per cycle, would depend on the sequence of deformations

Reynolds number. Here, however, we show that the original analysis which
supported this idea is inappropriate to investigate the motion of extended
bodies in the context of general relativity, rendering its quantitative results
invalid and casting doubts on the reality of this swimming effect. We
illustrate this by showing that the original analysis leads to a non-zero
deviation even in a scenario where no swimming can possibly occur.
Notwithstanding, by applying a fully covariant, local formalism, we show that
swimming in curved spacetime is indeed possible and that, in general, its

identifying local configurations in STM, a microscopic model for the growth of
TiOPc bilayers on Ag(111) is suggested. We demonstrate that defect structures
within these bilayers lead to characteristic vibrational signatures which react
sensitively to the local environment of the molecules. Thermal desorption
spectroscopy reveals a high thermal stability of the TiOPc bilayer up to 500 K,
which is attributed to hydrogen bonds between oxygen of the titanyl unit and
the hydrogen rim of phthalocyanines in the second layer, in addition to
contributions arising from the oppositely oriented axial dipole moments and the
ubiquitous van der Waals interactions.

vertices is called a {\em tournament}. Finding the ""best"" set of vertices of a
tournament is a well studied problem in social choice theory. A {\em tournament
solution} takes a tournament as input and outputs a subset of vertices of the
input tournament. However, in many applications, for example, choosing the best
set of drugs from a given set of drugs, the edges of the tournament are given
only implicitly and knowing the orientation of an edge is costly. In such
scenarios, we would like to know the best set of vertices (according to some
tournament solution) by ""querying"" as few edges as possible. We, in this paper,
precisely study this problem for commonly used tournament solutions: given an
oracle access to the edges of a tournament T, find $f(T)$ by querying as few
edges as possible, for a tournament solution f. We first show that the set of
Condorcet non-losers in a tournament can be found by querying $2n-\lfloor \log
n \rfloor -2$ edges only and this is tight in the sense that every algorithm
for finding the set of Condorcet non-losers needs to query at least $2n-\lfloor
\log n \rfloor -2$ edges in the worst case, where $n$ is the number of vertices
in the input tournament. We then move on to study other popular tournament
solutions and show that any algorithm for finding the Copeland set, the Slater
set, the Markov set, the bipartisan set, the uncovered set, the Banks set, and
the top cycle must query $\Omega(n^2)$ edges in the worst case. On the positive
side, we are able to circumvent our strong query complexity lower bound results
by proving that, if the size of the top cycle of the input tournament is at
most $k$, then we can find all the tournament solutions mentioned above by
querying $O(nk + \frac{n\log n}{\log(1-\frac{1}{k})})$ edges only.

  The methods include the Higuchi method for the fractal dimension computation,
the estimation of the spectral decay ($\beta$), the generalized Hurst exponent

set of evolutionary tracks from the ZAMS to the white dwarf stage appropriate
for the study of the formation and evolution of white dwarfs resulting from the

evolution and their helium-rich progenitors have been explored. In particular,
the final mass of the remnants, the role of overshooting during the
thermally-pulsing phase, and the cooling of the resulting white dwarfs differ
markedly from the evolutionary predictions of progenitor stars with standard
initial helium abundance. Finally, the pulsational properties of the resulting
white dwarfs are also explored. We find that, for the range of initial masses
explored in this paper, the final mass of the helium-rich progenitors is
markedly larger than the final mass expected from progenitors with the usual
helium abundance. We also find that progenitors with initial mass smaller than
$M_\star \simeq 0.65\,M_\odot$ evolve directly into helium-core white dwarfs in
less than 14~Gyr, and that for larger progenitor masses the evolution of the
resulting low-mass carbon-oxygen white dwarfs is dominated by residual nuclear
burning. For helium-core white dwarfs, we find that they evolve markedly faster
than their counterparts coming from standard progenitors. Also, in contrast
with what occurs for white dwarfs resulting from progenitors with the standard
helium abundance, the impact of residual burning on the cooling time of white
dwarfs is not affected by the occurrence of overshooting during the

two-dimensional matter wave dark solitons in a Thomas-Fermi rubidium condensate
using various techniques. An initially imprinted sharp phase gradient leads to
the dynamical formation of a stationary soliton as well as very shallow grey
solitons, whereas a smooth gradient only creates grey solitons. The depth and
hence, the velocity of the soliton is provided by the spatial width of the
phase gradient, and it also strongly influences the snake-instability dynamics
of the two dimensional solitons. The vortex dipoles stemming from the unstable
soliton exhibit rich dynamics. Notably, the annihilation of a vortex dipole via
a transient dark lump or a vortexonium state, the exchange of vortices between
either a pair of vortex dipoles or a vortex dipole and a single vortex, and so
on. For sufficiently large width of the initial phase gradient, the solitons
may decay directly into vortexoniums instead of vortex pairs, and also the
decay rate is augmented. Later, we discuss alternative techniques to generate
dark solitons, which involve a Gaussian potential barrier and time-dependent
interactions, both linear and periodic. The properties of the solitons can be
controlled by tuning the amplitude or the width of the potential barrier. In
the linear case, the number of solitons and their depths are determined by the
quench time of the interactions. For the periodic modulation, a transient
soliton lattice emerges with its periodicity depending on the modulation
frequency, through a wave number selection governed by the local Bogoliubov
spectrum. Interestingly, for sufficiently low barrier potential, both Faraday
pattern and soliton lattice coexist. The snake instability dynamics of the
soliton lattice is characteristically modified if the Faraday pattern is
present.

Bernoulli measure to present the operational characterization. As the first
step of the research of this line, in this paper we consider the case of finite
probability space, i.e., the case where the sample space of the underlying
probability space is finite, for simplicity. We give a natural operational
characterization of the notion of conditional probability in terms of ensemble,
and give equivalent characterizations of the notion of independence between two
events based on it. Furthermore, we give equivalent characterizations of the
notion of independence of an arbitrary number of events/random variables in

Significant contributions have been made in the field over recent years, but
open research problems still remain and hinder a wider (commercial) deployment
of the technology. This paper presents an overview of the field of automatic
ear recognition (from 2D images) and focuses specifically on the most recent,
descriptor-based methods proposed in this area. Open challenges are discussed
and potential research directions are outlined with the goal of providing the
reader with a point of reference for issues worth examining in the future. In
addition to a comprehensive review on ear recognition technology, the paper
also introduces a new, fully unconstrained dataset of ear images gathered from
the web and a toolbox implementing several state-of-the-art techniques for ear
recognition. The dataset and toolbox are meant to address some of the open

computational learning setup. The core hypothesis is that simpler instances
should be learned early as building blocks to learn more complex ones. Despite
its usefulness, it is still unknown how exactly the internal representation of
models are affected by curriculum learning. In this paper, we study the effect
of curriculum learning on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which have
shown strong competency in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems. Our
experiments on sentiment analysis task and a synthetic task similar to sequence
prediction tasks in NLP show that curriculum learning has a positive effect on
the LSTM's internal states by biasing the model towards building constructive
representations i.e. the internal representation at the previous timesteps are
used as building blocks for the final prediction. We also find that smaller
models significantly improves when they are trained with curriculum learning.
Lastly, we show that curriculum learning helps more when the amount of training
data is limited.

took place at Institutions in Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador,
Peru and Bolivia at an advanced undergraduate and graduate level. During these

scintillator and silicon photomultipliers, designed specifically for this
project. After the courses, a functional detector remained at each institution
to be used by the faculty to facilitate the training of future students and to
support and enable local research activities. The five-days workshops covered
topics such as elementary particle and cosmic ray Physics, radiation detection
and instrumentation, low-level light sensing with solid state devices,
front-end analog electronics and object-oriented data analysis (C++ and ROOT).
Throughout this initiative, about a hundred of talented and highly motivated
young students were reached. With the detector as a common thread, they were
able to understand the designing principles and the underlying Physics involved
in it, build the device, start it up, characterize it, take data and analyze
it, mimicking the stages of a real elementary particle Physics experiment.

analyzed entirely by a single centralized computer, or when datasets are
already stored in distributed database systems, the strategy of
divide-and-combine has been the method of choice for scalability. Due to
partition, the sub-dataset sample sizes may be uneven and some possibly close
to p, which calls for regularization techniques to improve numerical stability.
However, there is a lack of clear theoretical justification and practical
guidelines to combine results obtained from separate regularized estimators,
especially when the final objective is simultaneous inference for a group of
regression parameters. In this paper, we develop a strategy to combine
bias-corrected lasso-type estimates by using confidence distributions. We show
that the resulting combined estimator achieves the same estimation efficiency
as that of the maximum likelihood estimator using the centralized data. As
demonstrated by simulated and real data examples, our divide-and-combine method
yields nearly identical inference as the centralized benchmark.

gamma-ray burst outflows using a Monte Carlo (MC) code. We consider the
Comptonization of photons with a fast cooled synchrotron spectrum in a
relativistic jet with photon to electron number ratio $N_{\gamma}/N_e = 10^5$.
For all our simulations, we use mono-energetic protons which interact with
thermalised electrons through the Coulomb interaction. The photons, electrons
and protons are cooled adiabatically as the jet expands outwards. We find that
the initial energy distribution of the protons and electrons do not have any
appreciable effect on the photon peak energy and the power-law spectrum above
the peak energy. We also find that the Coulomb interaction between the
electrons and the protons does not affect the output photon spectrum
significantly as the energy of the electrons is elevated only marginally. The
peak energy and the spectral indices for the low and high energy power-law
tails of the photon spectrum remain practically unchanged even in the presence
of electron-proton coupling. Increasing the initial optical depth $\tau_{in}$
results in shallower photon spectrum below the peak energy ($f_{\nu} \propto
\nu^{1.1}$ for $\tau_{in} = 2$ to $f_{\nu} \propto \nu^{0.3}$ for $\tau_{in} =
16$) and fewer photons at the high-energy tail, although $f_{\nu} \propto
\nu^{-0.5}$ above the peak energy up to $\sim 1$ MeV, independent of
$\tau_{in}$. The peak energy of the seed photon spectrum $E_{\gamma,peak}$
determines the peak energy and the shape of the output photon spectrum. Lastly,
we find that our simulation results are quite sensitive to $N_{\gamma}/N_e$,
for $N_{e} = 10^3$. For almost all our simulations, we obtain an output photon
spectrum with power-law tail above $E_{\gamma,peak}$ extending up to $\sim 1$
MeV.

industrial workload. The unique challenge of TaaS is that it must satisfy a
wide range of customers who have no experience and resources to tune DL
hyper-parameters, and meticulous tuning for each user's dataset is
prohibitively expensive. Therefore, TaaS hyper-parameters must be fixed with
values that are applicable to all users. IBM Watson Natural Language Classifier
(NLC) service, the most popular IBM cognitive service used by thousands of
enterprise-level clients around the globe, is a typical TaaS service. By
evaluating the NLC workloads, we show that only the conservative
hyper-parameter setup (e.g., small mini-batch size and small learning rate) can
guarantee acceptable model accuracy for a wide range of customers. We further
justify theoretically why such a setup guarantees better model convergence in
general. Unfortunately, the small mini-batch size causes a high volume of
communication traffic in a parameter-server based system. We characterize the
high communication bandwidth requirement of TaaS using representative
industrial deep learning workloads and demonstrate that none of the
state-of-the-art scale-up or scale-out solutions can satisfy such a

both commercial benchmarks and public benchmarks to demonstrate that it
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-server based

reaches near the best possible runtime performance, constrained only by the
hardware limitation. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, GaDei is the

particular, acyclic SCMs, also known as recursive SEMs, form a well-studied
subclass of SCMs that generalize causal Bayesian networks to allow for latent
confounders. In this paper, we investigate SCMs in a more general setting,
allowing for the presence of both latent confounders and cycles. We show that
in the presence of cycles, many of the convenient properties of acyclic SCMs do
not hold in general: they do not always have a solution; they do not always
induce unique observational, interventional and counterfactual distributions; a
marginalization does not always exist, and if it exists the marginal model does
not always respect the latent projection; they do not always satisfy a Markov
property; and their graphs are not always consistent with their causal
semantics. We prove that for SCMs in general each of these properties does hold
under certain solvability conditions. Our work generalizes results for SCMs
with cycles that were only known for certain special cases so far. We introduce
the class of simple SCMs that extends the class of acyclic SCMs to the cyclic
setting, while preserving many of the convenient properties of acyclic SCMs.

and has been the subject of much research in recent years, leading to the
development of several systems for facilitating deep learning. Current systems,
however, mainly focus on model building and training phases, while the issues
of data management, model sharing, and lifecycle management are largely
ignored. Deep learning modeling lifecycle generates a rich set of data
artifacts, such as learned parameters and training logs, and comprises of
several frequently conducted tasks, e.g., to understand the model behaviors and
to try out new models. Dealing with such artifacts and tasks is cumbersome and
largely left to the users. This paper describes our vision and implementation
of a data and lifecycle management system for deep learning. First, we
generalize model exploration and model enumeration queries from commonly
conducted tasks by deep learning modelers, and propose a high-level domain
specific language (DSL), inspired by SQL, to raise the abstraction level and
accelerate the modeling process. To manage the data artifacts, especially the
large amount of checkpointed float parameters, we design a novel model
versioning system (dlv), and a read-optimized parameter archival storage system
(PAS) that minimizes storage footprint and accelerates query workloads without
losing accuracy. PAS archives versioned models using deltas in a
multi-resolution fashion by separately storing the less significant bits, and
features a novel progressive query (inference) evaluation algorithm. Third, we
show that archiving versioned models using deltas poses a new dataset
versioning problem and we develop efficient algorithms for solving it. We
conduct extensive experiments over several real datasets from computer vision

the kinematics of the scattering allows sensitivity to dark matter as light as

calculate the rate for the leading dark matter scattering interaction, where an
off-shell phonon splits into two or more higher-momentum excitations. We

radial trends in H$_2$O, OH, and CO line fluxes that can be used as benchmarks

secondary source (B) at a radius of 2 AU contributing fB/ fA = 1.3 +/- 0.1% of
the flux of the AGB star. L2 Pup B is also detected in CO emission lines at a
radial velocity of vB = 12.2 +/- 1.0 km/s. The close coincidence of the center
of rotation of the gaseous disk with the position of the continuum emission

orbital period around 5 years. Its continuum brightness and molecular emission
suggest that it may be surrounded by an extended molecular atmosphere or an

is detected. All the procedures used in the protection equipment were designed
and implemented according to known working scenarios of the system and are

  This paper proposes a novel approach to monitoring and fault protection of
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) superconducting magnets which employs
state-of-the-art Deep Learning algorithms. Consequently, the authors of the
paper decided to examine the performance of LSTM recurrent neural networks for
modeling of voltage time series of the magnets. In order to address this
challenging task different network architectures and hyper-parameters were used
to achieve the best possible performance of the solution. The regression
results were measured in terms of RMSE for different number of future steps and
history length taken into account for the prediction. The best result of
RMSE=0.00104 was obtained for a network of 128 LSTM cells within the internal
layer and 16 steps history buffer.

propagating along a characteristic line does not evolve into a cascade of
disturbances, but rather concentrates on a pattern of characteristic lines.
This pattern is the field pattern. In one spatial direction plus time, the
field patterns occur when the slope of the characteristics is, in a sense,
commensurate with the space-time microstructure. Field patterns with different
spatial shifts do not generally interact, but rather evolve as if they live in
separate dimensions, as many dimensions as the number of field patterns.
Alternatively one can view a collection as a multicomponent potential, with as
many components as the number of field patterns. Presumably if one added a tiny
nonlinear term to the wave equation one would then see interactions between
these field patterns in the multidimensional space that one can consider them
to live, or between the different field components of the multicomponent

uncorrelated electron gas to a condensate of Cooper pairs in which the relative
phases of the constituent electrons are coherent over macroscopic length
scales. The degree of correlation is quantified by a complex-valued order
parameter, whose amplitude is proportional to the strength of the pairing
potential in the condensate. Supercurrent-carrying states are associated with
non-zero values of the spatial gradient of the phase. The pairing potential and
several physical observables of the Cooper condensate can be manipulated by
means of temperature, current bias, dishomogeneities in the chemical
composition or application of a magnetic field. Here we show evidence of
complete suppression of the energy gap in the local density of quasiparticle
states (DOS) of a superconducting nanowire upon establishing a phase difference
equal to pi over a length scale comparable to the superconducting coherence
length. These observations are consistent with a complete collapse of the
pairing potential in the center of the wire, in accordance with theoretical
modeling based on the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity in diffusive
systems. Our spectroscopic data, fully exploring the phase-biased states of the
condensate, highlight the profound effect that extreme phase gradients exert on
the amplitude of the pairing potential. Moreover, the sharp magnetic response
observed near the onset of the superconducting gap collapse regime can be
exploited to realize ultra-low noise magnetic flux detectors.

multiplier algebra $M(A)$. Our focus are the obstructions caused by the size of
the collection we want to lift. It is known that no obstacles show up when
lifting a countable family of commuting projections, or of pairwise orthogonal
positive elements. However, this is not the case for larger collections. We
prove in fact that for every primitive, non-unital, $\sigma$-unital
$\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra $A$, there exists an uncountable set of pairwise
orthogonal positive elements in $Q(A)$ such that no uncountable subset of it
can be lifted to a set of commuting elements of $M(A)$. Moreover, the positive
elements in $Q(A)$ can be chosen to be projections if $A$ has real rank zero.

  from the Lipkin model Hamiltonian",,,"10.1063/1.4974989",,"cond-mat.str-el nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coupled cluster and symmetry projected Hartree-Fock are two central paradigms
in electronic structure theory. However, they are very different. Single
reference coupled cluster is highly successful for treating weakly correlated
systems, but fails under strong correlation unless one sacrifices good quantum
numbers and works with broken-symmetry wave functions, which is unphysical for
finite systems. Symmetry projection is effective for the treatment of strong
correlation at the mean-field level through multireference non-orthogonal
configuration interaction wavefunctions, but unlike coupled cluster, it is
neither size extensive nor ideal for treating dynamic correlation. We here
examine different scenarios for merging these two dissimilar theories. We carry
out this exercise over the integrable Lipkin model Hamiltonian, which despite
its simplicity, encompasses non-trivial physics for degenerate systems and can
be solved via diagonalization for a very large number of particles. We show how
symmetry projection and coupled cluster doubles individually fail over
different correlation limits, whereas models that merge these two theories are
highly successful over the entire phase diagram. Despite the simplicity of the
Lipkin Hamiltonian, the lessons learned in this work will be useful for
building an ab initio symmetry projected coupled cluster theory that we expect
to be accurate over the weakly and strongly correlated limits, as well as the
recoupling regime.

investigated, such as quantum point contacts, open or closed quantum dots, etc.
We study the behaviour of the conductance of a quantum point contact with a
gradually forming adjacent cavity in series under the influence of a scanning
gate. Here, an initially open quantum point contact system gradually turns into
a closed cavity system. We observe branches and interference fringes known from
quantum point contacts coexisting with irregular conductance fluctuations.
Unlike the branches, the fluctuations cover the entire area of the cavity. In
contrast to previous studies, we observe and investigate branches under the
influence of the confining stadium potential, which is gradually built up. We
find that the branches exist only in the area surrounded by cavity top gates.
As the stadium shrinks, regular fringes originate from tip-induced
constrictions leading to quantized conduction. In addition, we observe arc-like
areas reminiscent of classical electron trajectories in a chaotic cavity. We
also argue that electrons emanating from the quantum point contact spread out
like a fan leaving branch-like regions of enhanced backscattering.

require closure, which is the process of representing the contribution of the
unresolved physics on the resolved physics. The Mori-Zwanzig (M-Z) procedure
allows one to write down formally closed evolution equations for the resolved
physics. In these equations, the unclosed terms are recast as a memory integral
involving the past history of the resolved variables, and a ""noise"" term. While
the M-Z procedure does not directly reduce the complexity of the original
system, these equations can serve as a mathematically consistent starting point
to develop closures based on approximations of the memory. In this scenario, a
priori knowledge of the memory kernel, which is not explicitly known for
nonlinear systems, is of paramount importance to assess the validity of a
memory approximation. Unraveling the memory kernel requires the determination
of the orthogonal dynamics which is a projected high-dimensional partial
differential equation that is not tractable in general. A method to estimate
the memory kernel a priori, using full-order solution snapshots, is proposed.
The main idea is to solve a pseudo orthogonal dynamics equation, that has a
convenient Liouville form, instead of the original one. This ersatz arises from
the assumption that the semi-group of the orthogonal dynamics operator is a
composition operator, akin to semi-groups of Liouville operators, for one
observable. The method is exact in the linear case where the kernel is known
explicitly. Results for under-resolved simulations of the Burgers and
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations demonstrate that the proposed technique can
accurately reconstruct the transfer of information between the resolved and
unresolved dynamics through memory, and provide valuable information about the
kernel.

in the set-oriented framework. The aim is to obtain optimal discrete-time
perturbations in nonlinear dynamical systems to transport a specified initial
measure on the phase space to a final measure in finite time. The measure is
propagated under system dynamics in between the perturbations via the
associated transfer operator. Each perturbation is described by a deterministic
map in the measure space that implements a version of Monge-Kantorovich optimal
transport with quadratic cost. Hence, the optimal solution minimizes a sum of
quadratic costs on phase space transport due to the perturbations applied at
specified times. The action of the transport map is approximated by a
continuous pseudo-time flow on a graph, resulting in a tractable convex
optimization problem. This problem is solved via state-of-the-art solvers to
global optimality. We apply this algorithm to a problem of transport between
measures supported on two disjoint almost-invariant sets in a chaotic fluid
system, and to a finite-time optimal mixing problem by choosing the final
measure to be uniform. In both cases, the optimal perturbations are found to
exploit the phase space structures, such as lobe dynamics, leading to efficient
global transport. As the time-horizon of the problem is increased, the optimal
perturbations become increasingly localized. Hence, by combining the transfer
operator approach with ideas from the theory of optimal mass transportation, we
obtain a discrete-time graph-based algorithm for optimal transport and mixing
in nonlinear systems.

Self-backhaul using cellular communication technology is considered as a
promising solution. Although some excellent works have been done on
self-backhaul in small cell networks, most of them do not consider the recent
advances of full-duplex (FD) and massive multiple-input and multiple-output

cell networks by combining FD and massive MIMO technologies. In our proposed
scheme, the macro base station (MBS) is equipped with massive MIMO antennas,
and the SBSs have the FD communication ability. By treating the SBSs as
\textit{special} macro users, we can achieve the simultaneous transmissions of
the access link of users and the backhaul link of SBSs in the same frequency.
Furthermore, considering the existence of inter-tier and intra-tier
interference, we formulate the power allocation problem of the MBS and SBSs as
an optimization problem. Because the formulated power allocation problem is a
non-convex problem, we transform the original problem into a difference of
convex program (DCP) by successive convex approximation method (SCAM) and
variable transformation, and then solve it using a constrained concave convex
procedure (CCCP) based iterative algorithm. Finally, extensive simulations are
conducted with different system configurations to verify the effectiveness of
the proposed scheme.

wave vectors in the spin wave spectrum (there is an analogous effect for the
nonuniform static transverse susceptibility). However, as the temperature
approaches $T_{\rm{N}}$, the exchange gaps are closing. We have calculated the

the continuous light curve of Quarter 14 with a duration of 100 d. In the
application of the shot analysis, an averaged profile of variations is assumed
to converge with a universal profile which reflects a physical mechanism
generating the microvariability in a blazar jet, although light-variation
profiles of selected shots show a variety. A mean profile, which is obtained by
aligning the peaks of the 195 shots, is composed of a spiky-shape shot
component at $\pm$0.1 d (with respect to the time of the peak), and two slow
varying components ranging from $-$0.50 d to $-$0.15 d and from 0.10 d to 0.45
d of the peak time. The former spiky feature is well represented by an
exponential rise of 0.043$\pm$0.001 d and an exponential decay of
0.061$\pm$0.002 d. These timescales are consistent with that corresponding to a
break frequency of a power spectrum density calculated from the obtained light
curve. After verification with the Monte-Carlo method, the exponential shape,
but not the observed asymmetry, of the shot component can be explained by noise
variation. The asymmetry is difficult to explain through a geometrical effect
(i.e. changes of the geometry of the emitting region), but is more likely to be
caused by the production and dissipation of high-energy accelerated particles
in the jet. Additionally, durations of the detected shots show a systematic
variation with a dispersion caused by a statistical randomness. A comparison
with the variability of Cygnus X-1 is also briefly discussed.

In this article, we aim to support the task of making sense from social media
data, and specifically, seek to build an autonomous message-classifier that
filters relevant and trustworthy information from Twitter. For our work, we
collected about 100 million public tweets, including users' past tweets, from
which we identified 72 rumours (41 true, 31 false). We considered over 80
trustworthiness measures including the authors' profile and past behaviour, the
social network connections (graphs), and the content of tweets themselves. We
ran modern machine-learning classifiers over those measures to produce
trustworthiness scores at various time windows from the outbreak of the rumour.
Such time-windows were key as they allowed useful insight into the progression
of the rumours. From our findings, we identified that our model was
significantly more accurate than similar studies in the literature. We also
identified critical attributes of the data that give rise to the
trustworthiness scores assigned. Finally we developed a software demonstration
that provides a visual user interface to allow the user to examine the
analysis.

of the terms for the variation of a Killing vector and expressions of the field

investigated by performing Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction along a

films with (generalized) liquid crystalline (LC) order is a difficult infinite
dimensional problem of direct relevance to the study of generalized
polymersomes, soft matter and the fascinating problem of understanding the
origin and formation of shape (morphogenesis). The symmetry of the free energy
of the LC film being considered and the topology of the surface to be
determined often requires that the equilibrium configuration possesses singular
structures in the form of topological defects such as disclinations for nematic
films. The precise number and type of defect plays a fundamental role in
restricting the space of possible equilibrium shapes. Flexible closed vesicles
with spherical topology and nematic or smectic order, for example, inevitably
possess four elementary strength $+1/2$ disclination defects positioned at the
four vertices of a tetrahedral shell. Here we address the problem of
determining the equilibrium shape of flexible vesicles with generalized LC
order. The order parameter in these cases is an element of $S^1/Z_p$, for any
positive integer $p$. We will focus on the case $p =3$, known as triatic LCs.
We construct the appropriate order parameter for triatics and find the
associated free energy. We then describe the structure of the elementary
defects of strength $+1/3$ in flat space. Finally, we prove that sufficiently
floppy triatic vesicles with the topology of the 2-sphere equilibrate to
octahedral shells with strength $+1/3$ defects at each of the six vertices,

is focused on the marginal probability density of finding a particle at a given

is found from an infinite hierarchy of differential-recurrence relations for
the coefficients that appear in the multipole expansion of the probability

allows the explicit calculation of the time dependence of the mean squared

coefficient and the ""shape"" of the positions distribution are examined.
Oscillations between two characteristic values were found in the time evolution
of the kurtosis, namely, between the value that corresponds to a Gaussian and
the one that corresponds to a distribution of spherical shell shape. In the
case of an ensemble of particles, each one rotating around an
uniformly-distributed random axis, it is found evidence of the so called effect

out the proton induced cacade models in which the high-energy emission is

from one node to another takes some amount of time. We first generalize the
idea of conductance to weighted graphs by defining $\phi_*$ to be the ""critical
conductance"" and $\ell_*$ to be the ""critical latency"". One goal of this paper
is to argue that $\phi_*$ characterizes the connectivity of a weighted graph
with latencies in much the same way that conductance characterizes the
connectivity of unweighted graphs.
  We give near tight lower and upper bounds on the problem of information
dissemination, up to polylogarithmic factors. Specifically, we show that in a
graph with (weighted) diameter $D$ (with latencies as weights) and maximum
degree $\Delta$, any information dissemination algorithm requires at least
$\Omega(\min(D+\Delta, \ell_*/\phi_*))$ time % in the worst case. We show
several variants of the lower bound (e.g., for graphs with small diameter,
graphs with small max-degree, etc.) by reduction to a simple combinatorial
game.
  We then give nearly matching algorithms, showing that information
dissemination can be solved in $O(\min((D+\Delta)\log^3{n}, (\ell_*/\phi_*)\log
n)$ time. This is achieved by combining two cases. We show that the classical
push-pull algorithm is (near) optimal when the diameter or the maximum degree
is large. For the case where the diameter and the maximum degree are small, we
give an alternative strategy in which we first discover the latencies and then
use an algorithm for known latencies based on a weighted spanner construction.
(Our algorithms are within polylogarithmic factors of being tight both for
known and unknown latencies.)

qualitatively the same behavior as we find in particles simulations. Moreover,
both global polarizations agree perfectly for low noise intensities. The
spatio-temporal structures of the GA are also in agreement with simulations. We
conclude that the GA shows qualitative agreement for a wide range of noise

alloying with prolonged and retarded nucleation of ad-islands. Beyond 50%
coverage de-alloying proceeds, joined by partial segregation of Pt towards the
centre of large islands in violent processes. Upon coalescence the irregularly
shaped vacancy clusters are filled by segregating Pt, which then take a compact
shape (black spots). As a result at around 85% coverage the strain of the

Pt-segregation is at its maximum. Further deposition of Ag leads to transient
re-entrant alloying and recovery of the pseudo-morphological layer. The black
spots persist even in/on several layers thick films. Ex-situ atomic force

of a system. In linear electronics, it has been critical for allowing
invariance to device properties. Negative feedback is also known to enhance
linearity in amplification, which is one of the most important foundations of
linear electronics. At the same time, thousands of transistors types have been
made available, suggesting that these devices, in addition to their known
variability of parameters, have distinguishing properties. The current work
reports a systematic approach to quantifying the potential of negative
feedback, with respect to bipolar transistors, as a means to providing device
invariance and linearity. Several methods, including concepts from multivariate
statistics and complex systems, are applied at the theoretical as well as
experimental levels, and a number of interesting results are obtained and
discussed. For instance, it has been verified that the transistors types indeed
have well-defined characteristics which clearly segregate them into groups. The
addition of feedback at moderate and intense levels promoted uniformization of
the properties of these transistors when used in a class A common emitter
configuration. However, such effect occurred with different efficiency
regarding the considered device features, and even intense feedback was unable
to completely eliminate device dependence. This indicates that it would be
interesting to consider the device properties in linear design even when
negative feedback is applied. We also verified that the linearization induced
in the considered experiments is relatively modest, with effects that depend on
type of transfer function of the original devices.

from locally perturbed periodic surfaces is way more challenging. In this
paper, we introduce and analyze a new numerical method to simulate scattering
from locally perturbed periodic structures based on the Bloch transform. As
this transform is applied only in periodic domains, we firstly rewrite the
scattering problem artificially in a periodic domain. With the help of the
Bloch transform, we secondly transform this problem into a coupled family of
quasiperiodic problems posed in the periodicity cell. A numerical scheme then
approximates the family of quasiperiodic solutions (we rely on the finite
element method) and backtransformation provides the solution to the original
scattering problem. In this paper, we give convergence analysis and error
bounds for a Galerkin discretization in the spatial and the quasiperiodicity's
unit cells. We also provide a simple and efficient way for implementation that
does not require numerical integration in the quasiperiodicity, together with
numerical examples for scattering from locally perturbed periodic surfaces

a.k.a. hashing, for nearest neighbor search problems. It has been seen that
high-dimensional data points can be quantized into binary codes to give an
efficient similarity approximation via Hamming distance. Among existing
schemes, ranking-based hashing is recent promising that targets at preserving
ordinal relations of ranking in the Hamming space to minimize retrieval loss.
However, the size of the ranking tuples, which shows the ordinal relations, is
quadratic or cubic to the size of training samples. By given a large-scale
training data set, it is very expensive to embed such ranking tuples in binary
code learning. Besides, it remains a dificulty to build ranking tuples
efficiently for most ranking-preserving hashing, which are deployed over an
ordinal graph-based setting. To handle these problems, we propose a novel
ranking-preserving hashing method, dubbed Ordinal Constraint Hashing (OCH),
which efficiently learns the optimal hashing functions with a graph-based
approximation to embed the ordinal relations. The core idea is to reduce the
size of ordinal graph with ordinal constraint projection, which preserves the
ordinal relations through a small data set (such as clusters or random
samples). In particular, to learn such hash functions effectively, we further
relax the discrete constraints and design a specific stochastic gradient decent
algorithm for optimization. Experimental results on three large-scale visual
search benchmark datasets, i.e. LabelMe, Tiny100K and GIST1M, show that the
proposed OCH method can achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-arts
approaches.

with each team in charge of performing an independent task/branch of execution.
The first technique promotes worker sharing (WS) between the two tasks,
allowing the threads of the task that completes first to be reallocated for use

  The two mechanisms are instantiated via a new malleable thread-level

benefits are illustrated via an implementation of the LU factorization with

Very low-mass (VLM) stars and brown dwarfs (BDs) present a different
rotational behaviour from their solar mass counter-parts. Aims. We investigate
the rotational evolution of young VLM stars and BDs using Monte Carlo
simulations under the hypothesis of disk locking and stellar angular momentum
conservation. Methods. We built a set of objects with masses ranging from 0.01
Mo to 0.4 Mo and considered models with single- and double- peaked initial
period distributions with and without disk locking. An object is considered to
be diskless when its mass accretion rate is below a given threshold. Results.
Models with initial single-peaked period distributions reproduce the
observations well given that BDs rotate faster than VLM stars. We observe a
correlation between rotational period and mass when we relax the disk locking
hypothesis, but with a shallower slope compared to some observational results.
The angular momentum evolution of diskless stars is flatter than it is for
stars with a disk which occurs because the moment of inertia of objects less
massive than 0.2 Mo remains pratically constant for a time scale that increases
with decreasing stellar mass. Conclusions. Comparing our results with the
available observational data we see that disk locking is not as important in
the low-mass regime and that the rotational behaviour of VLM stars and BDs is
different from what is seen in their solar mass counterparts.

magneto-optical trap as a cooling system and an optical dipole trap to enhance
quantum degeneracy. This results in expected Fermi degeneracy factors $T/T_F$
comparable to the lowest values recently achieved, with potential for a direct
implementation in optical lattices. The experimental demonstration of this

when spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is ignored. The band inversion between B px (pz)
and py orbitals at X point is responsible for the formation of node-line
semimetals. Three node-line rings around X point are protected by the
combination of the time-reversal and spatial inversion symmetries, and the
drumhead surface bands are obtained in the interiors of the projected node-line
rings. When SOC is included, tiny gaps (< 4.8 meV) open at the crossing lines,
and the XB6 becomes strong topological insulators with Z2 indices (1;111). As
the SOC-induced gap opening is negligible, our findings thus suggest ideal real
systems for experimental exploration of the fundamental physics of topological
node-line semimetals.

impart a kick velocity to the new-born neutron star (NS). For neutrino-driven
explosions the NS acceleration was shown to be mainly caused by the
gravitational attraction of the anisotropically expelled inner ejecta, while
hydrodynamic forces contribute on a subdominant level, and asymmetric neutrino
emission plays only a secondary role. Two- and three-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations demonstrated that this gravitational tug-boat mechanism can explain
the observed space velocities of young NSs up to more than 1000 km/s. Here, we
discuss how the NS kick depends on the energy, ejecta mass, and asymmetry of
the SN explosion, and which role the compactness of the pre-collapse stellar
core plays for the momentum transfer to the NS. We also provide simple analytic
expressions for the NS velocity in terms of these quantities. Referring to
results of hydrodynamic simulations in the literature, we argue why within the
discussed scenario of NS acceleration, electron-capture SNe, low-mass Fe-core
SNe and ultra-stripped SNe can be expected to have considerably lower intrinsic
NS kicks than core-collapse SNe of massive stellar cores. Our basic arguments
remain valid also if progenitor stars possess large-scale asymmetries in their
convective silicon and oxygen burning layers. Possible scenarios for spin-kick
alignment are sketched. Much of our discussion remains on a conceptual and
qualitative level and more work is needed on the numerical modeling side to
determine the dependences of involved parameters, whose prescriptions will be
needed for recipes that can be used to better describe NS kicks in binary
evolution and population synthesis studies.

set operations necessary for deciding the problems in a unified whole.

"1612.01830","Harun Omer","Harun Omer","Strings in Background Fields",,,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper free quantum theories are derived solely from their underlying
symmetry group without reference to a Lagrangean or classical physics and then
interactions are introduced by making use of automorphism of the symmetry
algebra. It is shown how the solution of a theory interacting with background
fields is obtained exactly and purely algebraically from the free theory by the
action of a linear operator. The method is first applied to the harmonic
oscillator interacting with a conserved current and in a second example to
string theory in the presence of constant dilaton, Kalb-Ramond or gravitational
fields. The derived interaction for the Kalb-Ramond background is periodic and
the interactions with a dilaton respectively a gravitational field exhibit a
strong-weak-coupling duality. Furthermore, it is proposed in this paper to
interpret T-duality as a position-momentum duality on compact space.

  sequestering in mitotic control","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1611.04781","Comput Struct Biotechnol J. 2015 Apr 9;13:320-8","10.1016/j.csbj.2015.03.006.",,"q-bio.MN math.AP math.CA math.DS q-bio.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The spindle checkpoint assembly (SAC) ensures genome fidelity by temporarily
delaying anaphase onset, until all chromosomes are properly attached to the
mitotic spindle. The SAC delays mitotic progression by preventing activation of
the ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) or cyclosome; whose
activation by Cdc20 is required for sister-chromatid separation marking the
transition into anaphase. The mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which contains
Cdc20 as a subunit, binds stably to the APC/C. Compelling evidence by Izawa and
Pines (Nature 2014; 10.1038/nature13911) indicates that the MCC can inhibit a
second Cdc20 that has already bound and activated the APC/C. Whether or not MCC
per se is sufficient to fully sequester Cdc20 and inhibit APC/C remains
unclear. Here, a dynamic model for SAC regulation in which the MCC binds a
second Cdc20 was constructed. This model is compared to the MCC, and the
MCC-and-BubR1 (dual inhibition of APC) core model variants and subsequently
validated with experimental data from the literature. By using ordinary
nonlinear differential equations and spatial simulations, it is shown that the
SAC works sufficiently to fully sequester Cdc20 and completely inhibit APC/C
activity. This study highlights the principle that a systems biology approach
is vital for molecular biology and could also be used for creating hypotheses
to design future experiments.
