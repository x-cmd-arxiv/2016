regularizing effect when applied to H\""older continuous and Lebesgue functions

continuous functions, we establish that the improvement of the regularity of
the modulus of continuity is given by the integral of the kernel, namely by the

that an improvement always exists, and it can be expressed in terms of Orlicz

can be obtained). These results can be applied, for instance, to Abel kernels

barely protruding from the chromosphere and spanning across just one granule in

temperatures (0.1 MK), and we investigate if such miniature loops also exist at
coronal temperatures (>1 MK). We used extreme UV imaging (EUV) observations
from the High-resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) at an unprecedented spatial
resolution of 0.3"" to 0.4"". Together with EUV imaging and magnetogram data from
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and X-Ray Telescope (XRT) data from Hinode
we investigated the spatial, temporal and thermal evolution of small loop-like
structures in the solar corona above a plage region close to an active region
and compared this to a moss area within the active region. We find that the
size, motion and temporal evolution of the loop-like features are consistent
with photospheric motions, suggesting a close connection to the photospheric
magnetic field. Aligned magnetograms show that one of their endpoints is rooted
at a magnetic concentration. Their thermal structure, as revealed together with
the X-ray observations, shows significant differences to moss-like features.
Considering different scenarios, these features are most probably miniature
versions of hot loops rooted at magnetic concentrations at opposite sides of a

cascade. In the asymptotic states reached at relaxation the turbulence has
vanished and there are only coherent vortical structures. We are interested in
the regime that precedes these ordered flow patterns, in which there still is
turbulence and imperfect but robust structures have emerged. To develop an
analytical description we propose to start from the stationary coherent states
and (in the direction opposite to relaxation) explore the space of
configurations before the extremum of the functional that defines the
structures has been reached. We find necessary to assemble different but
related models: point-like vortices, its field theoretical formulation as
interacting matter and gauge fields, chiral model and surfaces with constant
mean curvature. These models are connected by the similar ability to describe
randomly interacting coherent structures. They derive exactly the same equation
for the asymptotic state (sinh-Poisson equation, confirmed by numerical
calculation of fluid flows). The chiral model, to which one can arrive from
self-duality equation of the field theoretical model for fluid and from
constant mean curvature surface equations, appears to be the suitable
analytical framework. Its solutions, the unitons, aquire dynamics when the
system is not at the extremum of the action. In the present work we provide
arguments that the underlying common nature of these models can be used to
develop an approach to fluid and plasma states of turbulence interacting with

measurements. The simulation outflow, which reflects the underlying angular
momentum of the accreted gas, changes direction significantly over the first

chemical potential of 3-cycles, $\mu$, the network decays into the maximally
possible number of almost full subgraphs, and the spectrum of the Laplacian
matrix acquires the two-zonal structure with a large gap. We find that the
Laplacian eigenvalue statistics corresponds to delocalized states in one zone,
and to the localized states in the second one. We interpret this behavior in
terms of the many-body localization problem where the structure of the Fock
space of some interacting many-body system is approximated by the RGG and/or by
the CERN. We associate 3-cycles in RRGs and CERNs as resonant triples in the
Fock space. We show that the scenario of the ""localization without disorder"",
discussed previously in physical space, can be realized in the Fock space as
well. We argue that it is natural to identify clusters in a RRG with particles
in a many-body system above the phase transition. We discuss the controversial
issue of an additional phase transition between ergodic and non-ergodic regimes
in the delocalized phase in the Fock space and find a strong ""memory

provide an advantage for computational and communication complexity.

known to be physically implementable. There is therefore considerable interest
in determining which processes are physical and which are just mathematical

be very powerful, subsuming all major previously studied modal logics for
strategic reasoning, including ATL, ATL*, and the like. Unfortunately, due to
its high expressiveness, SL has a non-elementarily decidable model-checking
problem and the satisfiability question is undecidable, specifically Sigma_1^1.
  In order to obtain a decidable sublogic, we introduce and study here One-Goal
Strategy Logic (SL[1G], for short). This is a syntactic fragment of SL,
strictly subsuming ATL*, which encompasses formulas in prenex normal form
having a single temporal goal at a time, for every strategy quantification of
agents. We prove that, unlike SL, SL[1G] has the bounded tree-model property
and its satisfiability problem is decidable in 2ExpTime, thus not harder than
the one for ATL*.

distributed helpers is considered. We introduce a new helper selection scheme
which maximizes the average throughput while maintaining a low power
consumption profile in the network. To this end, all transmissions are assumed
to be performed using power control. We assume that each node can estimate the
channel between itself and a receiving node. Then, it evaluates the minimum
transmission power needed to achieve the desired signal to noise ratio (SNR).
If the required transmission power is less than the maximum transmission power
of the node, the communication is regarded as successful. Otherwise, the
transmission is canceled. %Also, we classify the helpers into six groups
according to their transmission rates IEEE 802.11b Standard. In order to
increase the average throughput, we assume that the cooperative link with the
highest transmission rate is chosen from those that can successfully forward
the source signal to destination. Also, when there are several links with the
same rates, the one with minimum required power is given the highest priority.
Assuming that the helpers are distributed as a Poisson point process with fixed
intensity, we derive exact expressions for the average throughput and the power
consumption of the network. Simulation results show that our scheme is able to
significantly increase the throughput in comparison to the conventional CoopMAC
network. It is also able to reduce the power consumption compared to a network
with no power control approach.

formulation of DPF physics reveals the existence of a velocity threshold

work done during shock propagation is adequate to ensure dissociation and
ionization of the gas being ingested. These developments are utilized to
formulate an algorithmic definition of DPF optimization that is valid in a wide

theory of DPF design optimization is proposed and illustrated for designing
devices working at one or two orders higher pressure of deuterium than the

minimises the energy of all local terms simultaneously. In general, even
deciding whether a Hamiltonian is frustration-free is a hard task, as it is
closely related to the QMA1-complete quantum satisfiability problem (QSAT) --
the quantum analogue of SAT, which is the archetypal NP-complete problem in
classical computer science. This connection shows that the frustration-free
property is not only relevant to physics but also to computer science. The
Quantum Lov\'asz Local Lemma (QLLL) provides a sufficient condition for
frustration-freeness. A natural question is whether there is an efficient way
to prepare a frustration-free state under the conditions of the QLLL. Previous
results showed that the answer is positive if all local terms commute. In this
work we improve on the previous constructive results by designing an algorithm
that works efficiently for non-commuting terms as well, assuming that the
system is ""uniformly"" gapped, by which we mean that the system and all its
subsystems have an inverse polynomial energy gap. Also, our analysis works
under the most general condition for the QLLL, known as Shearer's bound.
Similarly to the previous results, our algorithm has the charming feature that
it uses only local measurement operations corresponding to the local

utilization of computing resources, increasingly adopt two computational
paradigms, namely, incremental and approximate computing. Incremental
computation updates the output incrementally instead of re-computing everything
from scratch for successive runs of a job with input changes. Approximate
computation returns an approximate output for a job instead of the exact
output.
  Both paradigms rely on computing over a subset of data items instead of
computing over the entire dataset, but they differ in their means for skipping
parts of the computation. Incremental computing relies on the memoization of
intermediate results of sub-computations, and reusing these memoized results
across jobs for sub-computations that are unaffected by the changed input.
Approximate computing relies on representative sampling of the entire dataset
to compute over a subset of data items.
  In this thesis, we make the observation that these two computing paradigms
are complementary, and can be married together! The high level idea is to:
design a sampling algorithm that biases the sample selection to the memoized
data items from previous runs. To concretize this idea, we designed an online
stratified sampling algorithm that uses self-adjusting computation to produce
an incrementally updated approximate output with bounded error. We implemented
our algorithm in a data analytics system called IncAppox based on Apache Spark
Streaming. Our evaluation of the system shows that IncApprox achieves the
benefits of both incremental and approximate computing.

for instance that more energy can be extracted from extreme EBI black holes

radiation hydrodynamical simulations by selecting a pair of massive dark matter
halos forming at $z >10$. We find that rich structures such as clumps and
filaments around the source galaxy shield the cloud from ionizing radiation. In
fact, in some cases, cloud collapse is accelerated under ionizing radiation.
This fact suggests that the ionization of the cloud's surroundings helps its
collapse. Only strong radiation at the early stage of structure formation can
halt the cloud collapse, but this is much stronger than observationally allowed
value. We also explored the effect of ionizing radiation on a sample of 68
halos by employing an analytical model and found that increase in the mean
density of the gas between the SMS forming cloud and the source galaxy protects
the gas cloud from ionizing radiation as they approach each other. Thus, we
conclude that ionizing radiation does not prevent the formation of an SMS in

measurements of the hot gas surface brightness, temperature, and iron abundance
using the modest Chandra observation and a previously unpublished Suzaku

be extended out to ~r_2500. By constructing hydrostatic equilibrium models of
the gas with separate components for the gas, BCG stellar mass, and the dark

value (7.1) expected for relaxed LCDM halos by $3.5 \sigma$ in terms of the
observational error, and by $6 \sigma$ considering the intrinsic scatter in the
LCDM c-M relation, which situates NGC 6482 as the most extreme outlier known
for a fossil system. We explored several variants of adiabatic contraction (AC)
models and, while the AC models provide fits of the same quality as the
un-contracted models, they do have the following advantages: (1) smaller c_200
that is less of an outlier in the LCDM c-M relation, and (2) baryon fractions
that agree better with the mean cosmic value. While the standard AC
prescriptions yield a BCG stellar mass that is uncomfortably small compared to
results from stellar population synthesis (SPS) models, a weaker AC variant
that artificially shuts off cooling and star formation at z=2 yields the same
stellar mass as the un-contracted models. For these reasons, we believe our
X-ray analysis prefers this weaker AC variant applied to either an NFW or
Einasto DM halo. Finally, the BCG stellar mass strongly favors SPS models with
a Chabrier or Kroupa IMF over a Salpeter IMF. (Abridged)

heterogeneous ice nucleation to a variety of fields, from cloud science to
microbiology, major gaps in our understanding of this ubiquitous process still
prevent us from answering this question. In this work, we have examined the
ability of generic crystalline substrates to promote ice nucleation as a
function of the hydrophobicity and the morphology of the surface. Nucleation
rates have been obtained by brute-force molecular dynamics simulations of
coarse-grained water on top of different surfaces of a model fcc crystal,
varying the water-surface interaction and the surface lattice parameter. It
turns out that the lattice mismatch of the surface with respect to ice,
customarily regarded as the most important requirement for a good ice
nucleating agent, is at most desirable but not a requirement. On the other
hand, the balance between the morphology of the surface and its hydrophobicity
can significantly alter the ice nucleation rate and can also lead to the
formation of up to three different faces of ice on the same substrate. We have
pinpointed three circumstances where heterogeneous ice nucleation can be
promoted by the crystalline surface: (i) the formation of a water overlayer
that acts as an in-plane template; (ii) the emergence of a contact layer
buckled in an ice-like manner; and (iii) nucleation on compact surfaces with
very high interaction strength. We hope that this extensive systematic study
will foster future experimental work aimed at testing the physiochemical
understanding presented herein.

span a wide range in planetary temperature and surface gravity, ranging from
super-Earths to giant planets, and have a high expected SNR. For all targets we
vary the enrichment, C/O ratio, presence of optical absorbers (TiO/VO) and
cloud treatment. We calculate atmospheric structures and emission and
transmission spectra for all targets and use a radiometric model to obtain
simulated observations. We analyze JWST's ability to distinguish between
various scenarios. We find that in very cloudy planets such as GJ 1214b less
than 10 transits with NIRSpec may be enough to reveal molecular features.
Further, the presence of small silicate grains in atmospheres of hot Jupiters
may be detectable with a single JWST MIRI transit. For a more detailed
characterization of such particles less than 10 transits are necessary.
Finally, we find that some of the hottest hot Jupiters are well fitted by
models which neglect the redistribution of the insolation and harbor
inversions, and that 1-4 eclipse measurements with NIRSpec are needed to
distinguish between the inversion models. Wet thus demonstrate the capabilities
of JWST for solving some of the most intriguing puzzles in current exoplanet

The all-order logarithmic structure of such distributions is often fully

additional difficulties (compared to one-dimensional cases like thrust), and
for which the resummation in distribution (or momentum) space has been a

free energy in the NPT-based framework. Different from the classical routines,
we combine the first law of thermodynamics and related thermodynamical

become the primary driving force of fluid motion. Moreover, we prove that the
proposed model satisfies the total (free) energy dissipation with time. For
numerical simulation of the proposed model, the key difficulties result from
the strong nonlinearity of Helmholtz free energy density and tight coupling
relations between molar densities and velocity. To resolve these problems, we
propose a novel convex-concave splitting of Helmholtz free energy density and
deal well with the coupling relations between molar densities and velocity
through very careful physical observations with a mathematical rigor. We prove

effects on the electronic and optical properties of graphene. It starts by
providing the crystallographic description of mechanical deformations, as well
as the diffraction pattern for different kinds of representative deformation
fields. Then, the focus turns to the unique elastic properties of graphene, and
to how strain is produced. Thereafter, various theoretical approaches used to
study the electronic properties of strained graphene are examined, discussing
the advantages of each. These approaches provide a platform to describe exotic
properties, such as a fractal spectrum related with quasicrystals, a mixed
Dirac-Schr\""odinger behavior, emergent gravity, topological insulator states,
in molecular graphene and other 2D discrete lattices. The physical consequences
of strain on the optical properties are reviewed next, with a focus on the
Raman spectrum. At the same time, recent advances to tune the optical
conductivity of graphene by strain engineering are given, which open new paths
in device applications. Finally, a brief review of strain effects in
multilayered graphene and other promising 2D materials like silicene and
materials based on other group-IV elements, phosphorene, dichalcogenide- and
monochalcogenide-monolayers is presented, with a brief discussion of interplays
among strain, thermal effects, and illumination in the latter material family.

samples behaves like $1/\sqrt{N}$. This scaling makes it often very time
intensive to reduce the error of computed observables, in particular for
applications in lattice QCD. It is therefore highly desirable to have
alternative methods at hand which show an improved error scaling. One candidate
for such an alternative integration technique is the method of recursive
numerical integration (RNI). The basic idea of this method is to use an
efficient low-dimensional quadrature rule (usually of Gaussian type) and apply
it iteratively to integrate over high-dimensional observables and Boltzmann
weights. We present the application of such an algorithm to the topological
rotor and the anharmonic oscillator and compare the error scaling to MCMC
results. In particular, we demonstrate that the RNI technique shows an error
scaling in the number of integration points $m$ that is at least exponential.

investigate the clustering signal dependence on radio-loudness and black hole
(BH) virial mass. We find that RLQs are clustered more strongly than RQQs in
all the redshift bins considered. We find a real-space correlation length of

$r_{0}=10.95_{-1.58}^{+1.22}\,h^{-1}\,\textrm{Mpc}$ {\normalsize{}for} RQQs and

found in more massive host haloes than RQQs in our samples, with mean host halo
masses of $\sim4.9\times10^{13}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ and
$\sim1.9\times10^{12}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$, respectively. Comparison with
clustering studies of different radio source samples indicates that this mass
scale of $\gtrsim1\times10^{13}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ is characteristic for the
bright radio-population, which corresponds to the typical mass of galaxy groups
and galaxy clusters. The similarity we find in correlation lengths and host
halo masses for RLQs, radio galaxies and flat-spectrum radio quasars agrees
with orientation-driven unification models. Additionally, the clustering signal
shows a dependence on black hole (BH) mass, with the quasars powered by the
most massive BHs clustering more strongly than quasars having less massive BHs.
We suggest that the current virial BH mass estimates may be a valid BH proxies

gravitational accelerations well below the limit were dark matter or modified
dynamics theories set in. Radial velocities with accuracy ~100 m/s were
obtained for each star, in order to constrain their orbital velocity, that,
together with proper motion data, can distinguish bound from unbound systems.
It was found that about half of the observed pairs do have velocity in the
expected range for bound systems, out to the largest separations probed here.
In particular, we identified five pairs with projected separation >0.15 pc that
are useful for the proposed test. While it would be premature to draw any
conclusion about the validity of Newtonian dynamics at these low accelerations,
our main result is that very wide binary stars seem to exist in the harsh

Newtonian dynamics versus modified dynamics theories in the low acceleration
conditions typical of galaxies. In the near future the GAIA satellite will
provide data to increase significantly the number of wide pairs that, with the

To the best of our knowledge, UMW is the first throughput-optimal algorithm of

Conceptually, the UMW policy is derived by relaxing the precedence constraints
associated with multi-hop routing, and then solving a min-cost routing and
max-weight scheduling problem on a virtual network of queues. When specialized
to the unicast setting, the UMW policy yields a throughput-optimal cycle-free

throughput-optimal Back- Pressure (BP) policy which allows for packet cycling,
resulting in excessive latency. Extensive simulation results show that the
proposed UMW policy incurs a substantially smaller delay as compared to the BP
policy. The proof of throughput-optimality of the UMW policy combines ideas
from stochastic Lyapunov theory with a sample path argument from adversarial
queueing theory and may be of independent theoretical interest.

patient treatment. In this, patients are asked to disclose personal information
such as genetic markers, lifestyle habits, and clinical history. This data is
then used by statistical models to predict personalized treatments. However,
due to privacy concerns, patients often desire to withhold sensitive
information. This self-censorship can impede proper diagnosis and treatment,
which may lead to serious health complications and even death over time. In
this paper, we present privacy distillation, a mechanism which allows patients
to control the type and amount of information they wish to disclose to the
healthcare providers for use in statistical models. Meanwhile, it retains the
accuracy of models that have access to all patient data under a sufficient but
not full set of privacy-relevant information. We validate privacy distillation
using a corpus of patients prescribed to warfarin for a personalized dosage. We
use a deep neural network to implement privacy distillation for training and
making dose predictions. We find that privacy distillation with sufficient
privacy-relevant information i) retains accuracy almost as good as having all
patient data (only 3\% worse), and ii) is effective at preventing errors that
introduce health-related risks (only 3.9\% worse under- or over-prescriptions).

Discriminant Analysis (SODA) to detect both main and quadratic interaction
effects in logistic regression and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA)
models. In the forward stage, SODA adds in important predictors evaluated based
on their overall contributions, whereas in the backward stage SODA removes
unimportant terms so as to optimize the extended Bayesian Information Criterion
(EBIC). Compared with existing methods on QDA variable selections, SODA can
deal with high-dimensional data with the number of predictors much larger than
the sample size and does not require the joint normality assumption on
predictors, leading to much enhanced robustness. We further extend SODA to
conduct variable selection and model fitting for multiple index models.
Compared with existing variable selection methods based on the Sliced Inverse
Regression (SIR) (Li 1991), SODA requires neither the linearity nor the
constant variance condition and is much more robust. Our theoretical analyses
establish the variable-selection consistency of SODA under high-dimensional
settings, and our simulation studies as well as real-data applications
demonstrate superior performances of SODA in dealing with non-Gaussian design
matrices in both classification problems and multiple index models.

the conventional model training requirement of annotated examples for every
category. This is achieved by establishing a mapping connecting low-level
features and a semantic description of the label space, referred as
visual-semantic mapping, on auxiliary data. Reusing the learned mapping to
project target videos into an embedding space thus allows novel-classes to be
recognised by nearest neighbour inference. However, existing ZSL methods suffer
from auxiliary-target domain shift intrinsically induced by assuming the same
mapping for the disjoint auxiliary and target classes. This compromises the
generalisation accuracy of ZSL recognition on the target data. In this work, we
improve the ability of ZSL to generalise across this domain shift in both
model- and data-centric ways by formulating a visual-semantic mapping with
better generalisation properties and a dynamic data re-weighting method to
prioritise auxiliary data that are relevant to the target classes.
Specifically: (1) We introduce a multi-task visual-semantic mapping to improve
generalisation by constraining the semantic mapping parameters to lie on a
low-dimensional manifold, (2) We explore prioritised data augmentation by
expanding the pool of auxiliary data with additional instances weighted by
relevance to the target domain. The proposed new model is applied to the
challenging zero-shot action recognition problem to demonstrate its advantages

particle velocity and period of oscillation. The developed technique is applied
to separate particles of the target dimension from the particle mixture.
Furthermore, we also demonstrate human keratinocyte cells can be separated in
the cell and bead mixture. The separation technique is incorporated with a
microfluidic channel spanning multiple pressure nodes, which is advantageous
over separation in a single pressure node in terms of high throughput.

3 encoders -- Late Fusion, Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder and Memory Network --

interestingly, in the presence of attractive interaction between two hyperfine

use of different AC polarizability of the electronic ground state
Yb($^{1}$S$_{0}$) and the long-lived metastable state Yb$^{*}$($^{3}$P$_{2}$),
it is suggested that the latter atoms can be localized and serve as a dilute
concentration of magnetic impurities while the former ones remain itinerant.
The exchange mechanism between the itinerant Yb and the localized Yb$^{*}$
atoms is analyzed and shown to be antiferromagnetic. The quadruple and octuple
interactions act to enhance the Kondo temperature $T_K$ that is found to be
experimentally accessible. The bare exchange Hamiltonian needs to be decomposed
into dipole ($d$), quadruple ($q$) and octuple ($o$) interactions in order to
retain its form under renormalization group (RG) analysis, in which the
corresponding exchange constants ($\lambda_{\mathrm{d}}$,
$\lambda_{\mathrm{q}}$ and $\lambda_{\mathrm{o}}$) flow independently.
Numerical solution of the RG scaling equations reveals a few finite fixed
points, indicating an over-screening, which suggests a non-Fermi liquid phase.
The impurity contribution to the magnetic susceptibility is calculated in the
weak coupling regime (${T}\gg{T}_{K}$).

understanding is still premature, although it could inspire researchers in
various fields, such as nonlinear science, fluid mechanics and geophysics, to
resolve their long-standing problems. Here, we perform a small-scale experiment
in which air flow is created in a thin granular bed to successfully find a
meandering regime, together with other remarkable fluidized regimes, such as a
turbulent regime. We discover that phase diagrams of the flow regimes for
different types of grains can be universally presented as functions of the flow
rate and the granular-bed thickness when the two quantities are properly
renormalized. We further reveal that the meandering shapes are self-similar as
was shown for meandering rivers. The experimental findings are explained by
theory, with elucidating the physics. The theory is based on force balance, a
minimum-dissipation principle, and a linear-instability analysis of a continuum
equation that takes into account the fluid-solid duality, i.e., the existence
of fluidized and solidified regions of grains along the meandering path. The
present results provide fruitful links to related issues in various fields,
including fluidized bed reactors in industry.

monotone circuits with a local oracle (CLOs), that does correspond to
communication protocols for the monotone Karchmer-Wigderson multi-function
$KW^m[U,V]$ making errors. The new randomized feasible interpolation thus shows
that a short semantic derivation (from a certain class of derivations larger
than in the original method) of the disjointness of $U, V$, $U$ closed upwards,
yields a small randomized protocol for and hence a small monotone CLO
separating the sets. To establish a lower bound for monotone CLOs separating
two NP sets, one closed upwards, is an open problem.
  This research is motivated by the open problem to establish a lower bound for
proof system $R(LIN)$ operating with clauses formed by linear Boolean functions

this proof system and also to the semantic versions of the cutting planes proof

framework in which the selfish secondary users are obliged to interact with
each other truthfully. Moreover, due to the vulnerability of these networks
against jamming attacks, designing anti-jamming defense mechanisms is equally
important. %providing the security defense is also of great importance. In this
paper, we propose a truthful mechanism, robust against the jamming, for a
dynamic stochastic cognitive radio network consisting of several selfish
secondary users and a malicious user. In this model, each secondary user
participates in an auction and wish to use the unjammed spectrum, and the
malicious user aims at jamming a channel by corrupting the communication link.
A truthful auction mechanism is designed among the secondary users.
Furthermore, a zero-sum game is formulated between the set of secondary users
and the malicious user. This joint problem is then cast as a randomized
two-level auctions in which the first auction allocates the vacant channels,
and then the second one assigns the remaining unallocated channels. We have
also changed this solution to a trustful distributed scheme. Simulation results
show that the distributed algorithm can achieve a performance that is close to
the centralized algorithm, without the added overhead and complexity.

most vivid fields in the design of novel functional materials. In this paper we
propose a simple scheme to predict \emph{band alignment }and \emph{charge
transfer} in complex oxide interfaces. For semiconductor heterostructures band
alignment rules like the well known Anderson or Schottky-Mott rule are based on
comparison of the work function or electron affinity of the bulk components.
This scheme breaks down for oxides due to the invalidity of a single
workfunction approximation as recently shown (Phys. Rev. B 93, 235116; Adv.
Funct. Mater. 26, 5471). Here we propose a new scheme which is built on a
continuity condition of valence states originating in the compounds' shared
network of oxygen. It allows for the prediction of sign and relative amplitude
of the intrinsic charge transfer, taking as input only information about the
bulk properties of the components. We support our claims by numerical density
functional theory simulations as well as (where available) experimental
evidence. Specific applications include i) controlled doping of SrTiO$_3$
layers with the use of 4$d$ and 5$d$ transition metal oxides and ii) the
control of magnetic ordering in manganites through tuned charge transfer.

Gaussian broadcast channel model with integrated services. Specifically, we
combine two sorts of service messages, and serve them simultaneously: one
multicast message intended for both receivers and one confidential message

secure from the unauthorized receiver. Due to the coupling of service messages,
it is intractable to seek capacity-achieving transmit covariance matrices.
Accordingly, we propose a suboptimal precoding scheme based on the generalized
singular value decomposition (GSVD). The GSVD produces several virtual
orthogonal subchannels between the transmitter and the receivers. Subchannel
allocation and power allocation between multicast message and confidential
message are jointly optimized to maximize the secrecy rate in this letter,
subject to the quality of multicast service (QoMS) constraints. Since this
problem is inherently complex, a difference-of-concave (DC) algorithm, together
with an exhaustive search, is exploited to handle the power allocation and
subchannel allocation, respectively. Numerical results are presented to
illustrate the efficacy of our proposed strategies.

methods including, treatment of multi-modal distributions, variable width full

review the literature on the topic of applying machine learning models to
MRI-based connectome data. This field is growing rapidly and now encompasses a

communication technology for supporting Internet of Things (IoT) services due

However, most LPWAN solutions like SIGFOX or LoRaWAN rely on star topology
networks, where stations (STAs) transmit directly to the gateway (GW), which
often leads to rapid battery depletion in STAs located far from it. In this
work, we analyze the impact on LPWANs energy consumption of multi-hop

power levels and higher data rates to closer parent STAs, reducing their energy
consumption consequently. To that aim, we introduce the Distance-Ring

performance of the so-called optimal-hop routing model, which establishes
optimal routing connections in terms of energy efficiency, aiming to balance
the consumption among all the STAs in the network. Results show that enabling
such multi-hop connections entails higher network lifetimes, reducing
significantly the bottleneck consumption in LPWANs with up to thousands of
STAs. These results lead to foresee multi-hop communication in the uplink as a
promising routing alternative for extending the lifetime of LPWAN deployments.

entanglement with very high quanta of OAM and improvement in angular resolution
in remote sensing. Till date, such hybrid entangled states are generated by
using a high-fidelity polarization entangled state and subsequent imprinting of

have feeble number of photons, loss of photons during imprinting of OAM using

The results from each methodology are compared against each other to establish
if they reach a statistically equivalent result in every case and to evaluate
their ability to minimize uncertainty in the measurement. We find that all
three methods produce reliable results. For every planet examined here NNBR and
PLD produce results that are in statistical agreement. However, the PMAP method
appears to produce results in slight disagreement in cases where the stellar
centroid is not kept consistently on the most well characterized area of the
detector. We evaluate the ability of each method to reduce the scatter in the
residuals as well as in the correlated noise in the corrected data. The NNBR
and PLD methods consistently minimize both white and red noise levels and
should be considered reliable and consistent. The planets in this study span
equilibrium temperatures from 1100 to 2000~K and have brightness temperatures
that require either high albedo or efficient recirculation. However, it is
possible that other processes such as clouds or disequilibrium chemistry may
also be responsible for producing these brightness temperatures.

effective mass and the symmetry energy at subsaturation densities. The mass
splitting of $m^{*}_{n}>m^{*}_{p}$ and $m^{*}_{n}<m^{*}_{p}$ in nuclear matter
and the different stiffness of symmetry energy are used in the model. The
single and double neutron to proton ratios of free nucleons and light particles
are thoroughly investigated in the isotopic nuclear reactions of
$^{112}$Sn+$^{112}$Sn and $^{124}$Sn+$^{124}$Sn at the incident energies of 50

splitting and symmetry energy impact the kinetic energy spectra of the single

constraints are obtained from the double ratio spectra, which are evaluated
from the ratios of isospin observables produced in $^{124}$Sn+$^{124}$Sn over
$^{112}$Sn+$^{112}$Sn collisions. A mass splitting of $m^{*}_{n}<m^{*}_{p}$ is
constrained from the available data at the energy of 120 MeV/nucleon. A soft
symmetry energy with the stiffness of $\gamma_{s}=$0.5 is close to the
experimental double ratio spectra at both energies.

fit a part of each Stokes profile around a target wavelength, and then
determine the magnetic field as a function of the wavelength which is
equivalent to get the magnetic field as a function of the height of line
formation.
  To test the performance of the new numerical code, we employed ""hare and

obtained by the code (called output). The precision of the code is also checked
by comparing our results to the ones obtained with the HAO MERLIN code. The
inversion code has been applied to synthetic Stokes profiles of the Na D$_{1}$

In
particular, they show rather specific behaviors in their homecoming, which are
interesting to observe and to describe analytically. In this paper, we present
a simple mathematical formulation to describe the little penguins parade in
Phillip Island. We observed that penguins have the tendency to waddle back and
forth on the shore to create a sufficiently large group and then walk home
compactly together. The mathematical framework that we introduce describes this
phenomenon, by taking into account ""natural parameters"" such as the eye-sight
of the penguins, their cruising speed and the possible ""fear"" of animals. On
the one hand, this favors the formation of conglomerates of penguins that
gather together, but, on the other hand, this may lead to the ""panic"" of
isolated and exposed individuals. The model that we propose is based on a set
of ordinary differential equations. Due to the discontinuous behavior of the
speed of the penguins, the mathematical treatment (to get existence and
uniqueness of the solution) is based on a ""stop-and-go"" procedure. We use this
setting to provide rigorous examples in which at least some penguins manage to
safely return home (there are also cases in which some penguins freeze due to
panic). To facilitate the intuition of the model, we also present some simple
numerical simulations that can be compared with the actual movement of the

vertical channel containing a Newtonian fluid is investigated numerically, for
terminal particle Reynolds numbers ranging from 1 to 10, and for a confinement
ratio equal to 4. While it is widely admitted that sufficiently inertial pairs
should sediment by performing a regular DKT oscillation
(Drafting-Kissing-Tumbling), the present analysis shows in contrast that a
chaotic regime can also exist for such particles, leading to a much slower
sedimentation velocity. It consists of a nearly horizontal pair, corresponding
to a maximum effective blockage ratio, and performing a quasiperiodic
transition to chaos under increasing the particle weight. For less inertial
regimes, the classical oblique doublet structure and its complex behavior
(multiple stable states and hysteresis, period-doubling cascade and chaotic
attractor) are recovered, in agreement with previous work [Aidun & Ding,
Physics of Fluids 15(6), 2003]. As a consequence of these various behaviors,
the link between the terminal Reynolds number and the non-dimensional driving
force is complex: it contains several branches displaying hysteresis as well as
various bifurcations. For the range of Reynolds number considered here, a
global bifurcation diagram is given.

sources through gain adaptation which employs probabilistic decisions (soft
decisions) from a classifier trained on offline calibration data. In this work,
calibration EEG data were collected in sessions where the participants listened
to two sound sources (one attended and one unattended). Cross-correlation
coefficients between the EEG measurements and the attended and unattended sound
source envelope (estimates) are used to show differences in sharpness and
delays of neural responses for attended versus unattended sound source. Salient
features to distinguish attended sources from the unattended ones in the
correlation patterns have been identified, and later they have been used to
train an auditory attention classifier. Compared to the existing results in the
literature, in this paper we have two main contributions. First, using the
auditory attention classifier, we have shown high offline detection performance
with single channel EEG measurements of shorter duration compared to the
existing approaches in the literature which employ large number of channels
with longer EEG measurements. Second, using the classifier trained offline in
the calibration session, we have shown the performance of the online sound

standard printed circuit boards (PCBs). However, the continuing improvements in
bandwidth performance of optical sources make it important to investigate
approaches to develop high bandwidth polymer waveguides. In this paper, we
present dispersion studies on a graded-index (GI) waveguide in siloxane
materials designed to deliver high bandwidth over a range of launch conditions.
Bandwidth-length products of >70 GHzxm and ~65 GHzxm are observed using a
50/125 um multimode fibre (MMF) launch for input offsets of +/- 10 um without
and with the use of a mode mixer respectively; and enhanced values of >100

~18 x 20 um^2. The large range of offsets is within the -1 dB alignment
tolerances. A theoretical model is developed using the measured refractive
index profile of the waveguide, and general agreement is found with

series of finite Markov chains. We assessed different aspects of this evolving
system via different properties of the Markov chains such as mixing time,
Kemeny constant, steady state probabilities and perturbation analysis of the
transition matrices. First, we showed how the time series of mixing times and
Kemeny constants could be used as an aggregate index of globalization. Next, we
focused on the steady state probabilities as a measure of structural power of
the economies that are comparable to GDP shares of economies as the traditional
index of economies. Further, we introduced two measures of systemic risk,
called systemic influence and systemic fragility, where the former is the ratio
of number of influenced nodes to the total number of nodes, caused by a shock
in the activity of a node and the latter is based on the number of times a
specific economic node is affected by a shock in the activity of any of the
other nodes. Finally, focusing on Kemeny constant as a global indicator of
monetary flow across the network, we showed that there is a paradoxical effect
of a change in activity levels of economic nodes on the overall flow of the
network. While the economic slowdown of the majority of nodes with high
structural power results to a slower average monetary flow over the network,
there are some nodes, where their slowdowns improve the overall quality of the
