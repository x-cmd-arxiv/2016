A
complex electrode structure is required for the beam splitter which would be
very difficult to produce with traditional manufacturing methods. Instead, we
make use of a nascent manufacturing technique: 3D printing of a plastic piece,
followed by electroplating. This fabrication method opens a plethora of avenues
for research, since 3D printing imposes practically no limitations on possible
shapes, and the plating produces chemically robust, conductive construction
elements with an almost free choice of surface material; it has the added
advantage of dramatically reduced production cost and time. Our beam splitter
is an electrostatic hexapole guide that smoothly transforms into two bent
quadrupoles. We demonstrate the correct functioning of this device by
separating a supersonic molecular beam of ND3 into two correlated fractions. It
is shown that this device can be used to implement experiments with
differential detection wherein one of the fractions serves as a probe and the
other as a reference. Reverse operation would allow to merging of two beams of
neutral polar molecules.

  Models","Under review at ICLR 2017",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study deep generative models for effective unsupervised
learning. We propose VGAN, which works by minimizing a variational lower bound
of the negative log likelihood (NLL) of an energy based model (EBM), where the
model density $p(\mathbf{x})$ is approximated by a variational distribution
$q(\mathbf{x})$ that is easy to sample from. The training of VGAN takes a two
step procedure: given $p(\mathbf{x})$, $q(\mathbf{x})$ is updated to maximize
the lower bound; $p(\mathbf{x})$ is then updated one step with samples drawn
from $q(\mathbf{x})$ to decrease the lower bound. VGAN is inspired by the
generative adversarial networks (GANs), where $p(\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to
the discriminator and $q(\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the generator, but with
several notable differences. We hence name our model variational GANs (VGANs).
VGAN provides a practical solution to training deep EBMs in high dimensional
space, by eliminating the need of MCMC sampling. From this view, we are also
able to identify causes to the difficulty of training GANs and propose viable
solutions. \footnote{Experimental code is available at

method in combinatorial discrepancy problems. However, in many cases it leads
to sub-optimal bounds as the partial coloring step must be iterated a
logarithmic number of times, and the errors can add up in an adversarial way.
We give a new and general algorithmic framework that overcomes the limitations
of the partial coloring method and can be applied in a black-box manner to
various problems. Using this framework, we give new improved bounds and
algorithms for several classic problems in discrepancy. In particular, for
Tusnady's problem, we give an improved $O(\log^2 n)$ bound for discrepancy of
axis-parallel rectangles and more generally an $O_d(\log^dn)$ bound for
$d$-dimensional boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Previously, even non-constructively,
the best bounds were $O(\log^{2.5} n)$ and $O_d(\log^{d+0.5}n)$ respectively.
Similarly, for the Steinitz problem we give the first algorithm that matches
the best known non-constructive bounds due to Banaszczyk [Banaszczyk 2012] in
the $\ell_\infty$ case, and improves the previous algorithmic bounds
substantially in the $\ell_2$ case. Our framework is based upon a substantial
generalization of the techniques developed recently in the context of the

observations of NSV 19992, the star at the projected centre of SuWt 2, have
found it to comprise two A-type stars in a 4.9 day eclipsing orbit, neither of
which could be the nebular progenitor. Radial velocity studies provided a hint
that the systemic velocity of this double A-type binary might be varying over
time, suggesting the presence of a third component hypothesised to be the
nebular progenitor. Here, we present an extensive radial velocity monitoring
study of NSV 19992, performed with the high-resolution echelle spectrograph
UVES mounted on ESO's VLT, in order to constrain the possible variation in the
systemic velocity of the A-type binary and its relation to the progenitor of
SuWt 2. The observations, acquired over a period of approximately one year,
show no evidence of variability in the systemic velocity of NSV 19992.
Combining these new observations with previous high-resolution spectroscopy
demonstrates that the systemic velocity is also stable over much longer periods
and, moreover, is distinct from that of SuWt 2, strongly indicating that the
two are not associated. We conclude that NSV 19992 is merely a field star
system, by chance lying in the same line of sight as the nebular centre, and
that it bares no relation to SuWt 2 or its, as yet unidentified, central
star(s).

integration by making datasets citable but authors typically refer to datasets
using inconsistent abbreviations and heterogeneous metadata (e.g. title,
publication year). It is thus hard to reproduce research results, to access
datasets for further analysis, and to determine the impact of a dataset.
Manually detecting references to datasets in scientific articles is
time-consuming and requires expert knowledge in the underlying research
domain.We propose and evaluate a semi-automatic three-step approach for finding
explicit references to datasets in social sciences articles.We first extract
pre-defined special features from dataset titles in the da|ra registry, then
detect references to datasets using the extracted features, and finally match
the references found with corresponding dataset titles. The approach does not
require a corpus of articles (avoiding the cold start problem) and performs
well on a test corpus. We achieved an F-measure of 0.84 for detecting
references in full-texts and an F-measure of 0.83 for finding correct matches
of detected references in the da|ra dataset registry.

expected to be nonmagnetic atomic singlets both in the weakly interacting
regime due to spin-orbit coupling, as well as in the Coulomb dominated regime
with oppositely aligned $L=1$ and $S=1$ angular momenta. However, starting with
the full multi-orbital electronic Hamiltonian, we show the low energy effective
magnetic Hamiltonian contains isotropic superexchange spin interactions but
anisotropic orbital interactions. By tuning the ratio of superexchange to
spin-orbit coupling $J_\mathrm{SE}/\lambda$, we obtain a phase transition from
nonmagnetic atomic singlets to novel magnetic phases depending on the strength
of Hund's coupling, the crystal structure and the number of active orbitals.
Spin-orbit coupling plays a non-trivial role in generating a triplon condensate
of weakly interacting excitations at antiferromagnetic ordering vector $\vec
k=\vec \pi$, regardless of whether the local spin interactions are
ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. In the large $J_\mathrm{SE} / \lambda$
regime, the localized spin and orbital moments produce anisotropic orbital
interactions that are frustrated or constrained even in the absence of
geometric frustration. Orbital frustration leads to frustration in the spin
channel opening up the possibility of spin-orbital liquids with both spin and
orbital entanglement.

information about the evolutionary history of populations, much of it in the

We introduce a method, Minimal-Assumption Genomic Inference of Coalescence

the distribution of coalescence times, by integrating information across
genomic length scales without using an explicit model of recombination,
demography or selection. Using simulated data, we show that MAGIC's performance
is comparable to PSMC' on single diploid samples generated with standard
coalescent and recombination models. More importantly, MAGIC can also analyze
arbitrarily large samples and is robust to changes in the coalescent and

also inappropriate to use the radial topology assumption exclusively because
the grids of metropolitan cities and regions with dense loads could be with

the historical smart meter measurements. Particularly, a probabilistic

Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis, to overcome the above-mentioned problems.
Once trained, our approach can automatically construct computer programs in a

magnetoresistance. We study the effect of magnetic field on the band structure
topology of these materials by applying a Zeeman splitting. In the absence of
magnetic field, we find that the materials are weak topological insulators,
which is in agreement with previous studies. When the magnetic field is
applied, we find that type-II Weyl points form. This result is found first from
a symmetry argument, and then numerically for a k.p model of TaAs2 and a
tight-binding model of NbSb2. This effect can be of help in search for an
explanation of the anomalous magnetoresistance in these materials.

instantons.
  The upshot of our discussions can be found in a set of lectures given by
Raymond in Erice in 1977 and a year later in a Physics Reports volume. I
present some recollections of that period; mostly how we were influenced by the
twistor approach. I discuss the Atiyah-Drinfeld-Hitchin-Manin (ADHM) method to
obtain instantons (""calorons"") in thermal QCD following earlier work. The
building blocks are a prepotential and a gauge invariant propagator.
  Then I will give surprisingly simple results in terms of these building
blocks for the one loop vacuum response to a change in caloron parameters and
some physical consequences for the effective action, in particular screening
properties.

RX J0852.0$-$4622 to better characterize its spectral properties and its
distribution over the SNR.
  Methods. The analysis of an extended High Energy Spectroscopic System
(H.E.S.S.) data set at very high energies (E > 100 GeV) permits detailed
studies, as well as spatially resolved spectroscopy, of the morphology and
spectrum of the whole RX J0852.0$-$4622 region. The H.E.S.S. data are combined
with archival data from other wavebands and interpreted in the framework of
leptonic and hadronic models. The joint Fermi-LAT-H.E.S.S. spectrum allows the
direct determination of the spectral characteristics of the parent particle
population in leptonic and hadronic scenarios using only GeV-TeV data.
  Results. An updated analysis of the H.E.S.S. data shows that the spectrum of
the entire SNR connects smoothly to the high-energy spectrum measured by
Fermi-LAT. The increased data set makes it possible to demonstrate that the
H.E.S.S. spectrum deviates significantly from a power law and is well described
by both a curved power law and a power law with an exponential cutoff at an
energy of $E_\mathrm{cut} = (6.7 \pm 1.2_\mathrm{stat} \pm 1.2_\mathrm{syst})$
TeV. The joint Fermi-LAT-H.E.S.S. spectrum allows the unambiguous
identification of the spectral shape as a power law with an exponential cutoff.
No significant evidence is found for a variation of the spectral parameters
across the SNR, suggesting similar conditions of particle acceleration across
the remnant. A simple modeling using one particle population to model the SNR
emission demonstrates that both leptonic and hadronic emission scenarios remain
plausible. It is also shown that at least a part of the shell emission is
likely due to the presence of a pulsar wind nebula around PSR J0855$-$4644.

demonstrate that unlike the multiple unicast problem, the computation capacity
of sum-networks depends on the characteristic of the finite field over which

sum-networks that have a rate-1 solution over one characteristic but a rate
close to zero over a different characteristic. Additionally, a sum-network can
have an arbitrary different number of computation capacities for different
alphabets. This is contrast to the multiple unicast problem where it is known
that the capacity is independent of the network coding alphabet.

objective, we should extract a joint representation that captures high-level
concepts among all modalities and through which we can exchange them
bi-directionally. As described herein, we propose a joint multimodal
variational autoencoder (JMVAE), in which all modalities are independently
conditioned on joint representation. In other words, it models a joint
distribution of modalities. Furthermore, to be able to generate missing
modalities from the remaining modalities properly, we develop an additional
method, JMVAE-kl, that is trained by reducing the divergence between JMVAE's
encoder and prepared networks of respective modalities. Our experiments show
that our proposed method can obtain appropriate joint representation from

importance for its increasing application in the areas of environment, food,
electrochemistry and clinical laboratory. Herein the dissociative adsorption
behavior of hydrogen peroxide on ultrathin magnesia (001) films deposited on
transition metal is uncovered for the first time by employing periodic
density-functional theory calculations with van der Waals corrections. The
hydrogen peroxide is dissociated smoothly and reduced to surface hydroxyls on
MgO(001)/TM, and the dissociative adsorption energies of all the considered
fragmentation configurations are substantially negative, demonstrating
dissociation and reduction of hydrogen peroxide on MgO(001)/TM is
thermodynamically favorable. The dissociative adsorption energy decreases
monotonously with increasing film thickness, demonstrating the lower reactivity
of thick oxide films. Moreover, we examined the suitability of several
transition metal slabs (molybdenum, silver, vanadium, tungsten and gold)
combined with magnesia for splitting hydrogen peroxide. The dissociative
adsorption energies enhance when the lattice constants of substrate slabs
increase, indicating the chemisorption strength can be tuned by category of
metal slabs as well as thickness of oxide film. The mechanism of reactivity
enhancement for energetically and dynamically favorable decomposition of
hydrogen peroxide on supported magnesia is elucidated by characterizing the
geometric structures and electronic properties. The fragmentation and reduction
of diethyl peroxide and peroxyacetone are also studied to reveal the catalytic
activity of ultrathin magnesia toward splitting organic peroxides. The results
are wished to provide useful clue for detecting and reducing hydrogen peroxide
and organic peroxides by employing oxide-metal hybrid nanostructure.

generated. Though the primordial tensor and scalar spectra are both nearly
scale invariant as in the inflationary scenario, the consistency relation in
our variant of Galilean Genesis is non-standard.

  corrected (v2)",,,,"gr-qc hep-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In three spatial dimensions, the Compton wavelength $(R_C \propto M^{-1}$)
and Schwarzschild radius $(R_S \propto M$) are dual under the transformation $M
\rightarrow M_{P}^2/M$, where $M_{P}$ is the Planck mass. This suggests that
there is a fundamental link -- termed the Black Hole Uncertainty Principle or
Compton-Schwarzschild correspondence -- between elementary particles in the $M
< M_{P}$ regime and black holes in the $M > M_{P}$ regime. In the presence of
$n$ extra dimensions, compactified on some scale $R_E$, one expects $R_S
\propto M^{1/(1+n)}$ for $R < R_E$, which breaks this duality. However, it may
be restored in some circumstances because the effective Compton wavelength
depends on the form of the $(3+n)$-dimensional wavefunction. If this is
spherically symmetric, then one still has $R_C \propto M^{-1}$, as in the
$3$-dimensional case. The effective Planck length is then increased and the
Planck mass reduced, allowing the possibility of TeV quantum gravity and black
hole production at the LHC. However, if the wave function is pancaked in the
extra dimensions and maximally asymmetric, then $R_C \propto M^{-1/(1+n)}$, so
that the duality between $R_C$ and $R_S$ is preserved. In this case, the
effective Planck length is reduced but the Planck mass is unchanged, so TeV
quantum gravity is precluded and black holes cannot be generated in collider
experiments. Nevertheless, the extra dimensions could still have consequences
for the detectability of black hole evaporations and the enhancement of
pair-production at accelerators on scales below $R_E$. Though
phenomenologically general for higher-dimensional theories, our results are
shown to be consistent with string theory via the minimum positional
uncertainty derived from $D$-particle scattering amplitudes.

exits in the vicinity of the jets and bubbles, just where the shear is large.
The typical amplification time of magnetic fields by the JEDD near the jets and
bubbles is approximately hundred million years. The amplification time in the
entire cooling flow region is somewhat longer. The vortices that create the
turbulence are those that also transfer energy from the jets to the
intra-cluster medium, by mixing shocked jet gas with the intra-cluster medium
gas, and by exciting sound waves. The JEDD model adds magnetic fields to the

the characterization of 16 electronic states (eight singlets and eight
triplets) considering unrelaxed and relaxed defect structures. The ground state
was found to be of 1Ag character with around 50% closed shell character. The
geometry optimization process leads to the formation of two five-membered rings
in a pentagon octagon pentagon structure. The closed shell character increases
thereby to ~70%, the analysis of unpaired density shows only small
contributions confirming the chemical stability of that entity. For the
unrelaxed structure the first five excited states (3B3g, 3B2u, 3B1u, 3Au and
1Au) are separated from the ground state by less than 2.5 eV. For comparison,
unrestricted density functional theory (DFT) calculations using several types
of functionals have been performed within different symmetry subspaces defined
by the open shell orbitals. Comparison with the MRCI results gave good
agreement in terms of finding the 1Ag state as ground state and in assigning
the lowest excited states. Linear interpolation curves between the unrelaxed
and relaxed defect structures also showed good agreement between the two
classes of methods opening up the possibilities of using extended nanoflakes
for multistate investigations at DFT level.

systems of equations such as those from the discretization of partial
differential equations. AMG is often understood as the acronym of ""Algebraic
Multi-Grid"", but it can also be understood as ""Abstract Muti-Grid"". Indeed, as
it demonstrates in this paper, how and why an algebraic multigrid method can be
better understood in a more abstract level. In the literature, there are a
variety of different algebraic multigrid methods that have been developed from
different perspectives. In this paper, we try to develop a unified framework
and theory that can be used to derive and analyze different algebraic multigrid
methods in a coherent manner. Given a smoother $R$ for a matrix $A$, such as
Gauss-Seidel or Jacobi, we prove that the optimal coarse space of dimension
$n_c$ is the span of the eigen-vectors corresponding to the first $n_c$
eigenvalues of $\bar RA$ (with $\bar R=R+R^T-R^TAR$). We also prove that this
optimal coarse space can be obtained by a constrained trace-minimization
problem for a matrix associated with $\bar RA$ and demonstrate that coarse
spaces of most of existing AMG methods can be viewed some approximate solution
of this trace-minimization problem. Furthermore, we provide a general approach
to the construction of a quasi-optimal coarse space and we prove that under
appropriate assumptions the resulting two-level AMG method for the underlying
linear system converges uniformly with respect to the size of the problem, the
coefficient variation, and the anisotropy. Our theory applies to most existing
multigrid methods, including the standard geometric multigrid method, the
classic AMG, energy-minimization AMG, unsmoothed and smoothed aggregation AMG,
and spectral AMGe.

string wrapping holomorphic, isolated, genus 0 curves. According to the residue
theorem of Beasley and Witten, the non-perturbative superpotential must vanish
in a large class of heterotic vacua because the contributions from curves in
the same homology class cancel each other. We point out, however, that in
certain cases the curves treated in the residue theorem as lying in the same
homology class, can actually have different area with respect to the physical
Kahler form and can be in different homology classes. In these cases, the
residue theorem is not directly applicable and the structure of the
superpotential is more subtle. We show, in a specific example, that the
superpotential is non-zero both on \tilde{X} and on X. On the non-simply
connected manifold X, we explicitly compute the leading contribution to the
superpotential from all holomorphic, isolated, genus 0 curves with minimal
area. The reason for the non-vanishing of the superpotental on X is that the
second homology class contains a finite part called discrete torsion. As a
result, the curves with the same area are distributed among different torsion
classes and, hence, do not cancel each other.

applications in different fields. Thus, finding an efficient and easy to
implement method to discriminate non-isomorphic graphs is valuable. In this
paper, a new method is introduced which is very simple and easy to implement,
but very efficient in discriminating non-isomorphic graphs, in practice. This
method does not need any heuristic attempt and based on the eigenvalues of a
new matrix representation for graphs. It, almost always, separates
non-isomorphic $n$-vertex graphs in time $O(n^3)$ and in worst cases such as
strongly regular graphs, in time $O(n^4)$. Here, we show that this method,
successfully, characterizes the isomorphism classes of studied instances of
strongly regular graphs (up to 64 vertices). Strongly regular graphs are
believed to be hard cases of the graph isomorphism problem.

new power allocation strategy for artificial noise (AN) is devised for physical
layer security enhancement. Specifically, we design a correlation-based power
allocation (CPA) for AN, of which the optimality in terms of achieving the
minimum secrecy outage probability is analytically proved in the large system
regime with the number of transmit antennas approaching infinity. In order to
fully reveal the benefits of the CPA, we derive easy-to-evaluate expressions
for the secrecy outage probability achieved by the CPA. Our study demonstrates
that the CPA is nearly optimal and significantly outperforms the widely-used
uniform power allocation (UPA) even for a moderately small number of correlated
transmit antennas. Furthermore, our numerical results reveal a fundamental
difference between the CPA and UPA. That is when the number of correlated
transmit antennas increases, the secrecy outage probability of the CPA always
reduces while the secrecy outage probability of the UPA suffers from a
saturation point.

Some applications, such as tracking, can use sensed acceleration and rate of
rotation to calculate displacement based on physical system models. Other
applications, such as activity recognition, extract manually designed features
from sensor inputs for classification. Such applications face two challenges.
On one hand, on-device sensor measurements are noisy. For many mobile
applications, it is hard to find a distribution that exactly describes the
noise in practice. Unfortunately, calculating target quantities based on
physical system and noise models is only as accurate as the noise assumptions.
Similarly, in classification applications, although manually designed features
have proven to be effective, it is not always straightforward to find the most
robust features to accommodate diverse sensor noise patterns and user
behaviors. To this end, we propose DeepSense, a deep learning framework that
directly addresses the aforementioned noise and feature customization
challenges in a unified manner. DeepSense integrates convolutional and
recurrent neural networks to exploit local interactions among similar mobile
sensors, merge local interactions of different sensory modalities into global
interactions, and extract temporal relationships to model signal dynamics.
DeepSense thus provides a general signal estimation and classification
framework that accommodates a wide range of applications. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of DeepSense using three representative and challenging tasks:
car tracking with motion sensors, heterogeneous human activity recognition, and
user identification with biometric motion analysis. DeepSense significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for all three tasks. In addition,
DeepSense is feasible to implement on smartphones due to its moderate energy
consumption and low latency

the control band policy $(0,q^{\star},Q^{\star},S^{\star})$, that brings the

multiple-output (MU-MIMO) cellular systems using millimeter-wave (mmWave)
communications, where multiple antennas will have to be used both at the
transmitter and the receiver to overcome the severe path loss. In this paper,
we characterize the gains of pilot precoding and combining in terms of channel
estimation quality and achievable data rate. Specifically, we consider three
uplink pilot transmission scenarios in a mmWave MU-MIMO cellular system: 1)
non-precoded and uncombined, 2) precoded but uncombined, and 3) precoded and
combined. We show that a simple precoder that utilizes only the second-order
statistics of the channel reduces the variance of the channel estimation error
by a factor that is proportional to the number of user equipment (UE) antennas.
We also show that using a linear combiner designed based on the second-order
statistics of the channel significantly reduces multiuser interference and
provides the possibility of reusing some pilots. Specifically, in the large
antenna regime, pilot precoding and combining help to accommodate a large
number of UEs in one cell, significantly improve channel estimation quality,
boost the signal-to-noise ratio of the UEs located close to the cell edges,
alleviate pilot contamination, and address the imbalanced coverage of pilot and

structure of the inner microjet can be decomposed into the low-velocity
component (LVC) at $\sim -70$ km/s and the high-velocity component (HVC) at
$\sim -180$ km/s. Based on the observed [Ne III] flux and its spatial extent,
we suggest the origins of the [Ne III] emission regions and their relation with
known X-ray sources along the jet. The flares from the hard X-ray source close
to the star may be the main ionization source of the innermost microjet. The
fainter soft X-ray source at 0"".2 from the star may provide sufficient heating
to help to sustain the ionization fraction against the recombination in the
flow. The outer knot may be reionized by shocks faster than 100 km/s such that
[Ne III] emission reappears and that the soft X-ray emission at 5"".5 is
produced. Velocity decomposition of the archival Hubble Space Telescope spectra
obtained in 1999 shows that the HVC had been faster, with a velocity centroid
of $\sim -260$ km/s. Such a decrease in velocity may potentially be explained
by the expansion of the stellar magnetosphere, changing the truncation radius
and thus the launching speed of the jet. The energy released by magnetic
reconnections during relaxation of the transition can heat the gas up to
several tens of megakelvin and provide the explanation for on-source keV X-ray
flares that ionize the neon microjet.

systematic expansion around the mean field BCS approximation of the ground
state. We show that the quantum hydrodynamic expression of the amplitudes
obtained by Landau and Khalatnikov apply only on the energy shell, that is for
resonant processes that conserve energy. The microscopic model yields the same
excitation spectrum as the Random Phase Approximation, with a linear (phononic)
start and a concavity at low wave number that changes from upwards to downwards
in the BEC-BCS crossover. When the concavity of the dispersion relation is
upwards at low wave number, the leading damping mechanism at low temperature is
the Beliaev-Landau process 2 phonons $\leftrightarrow$ 1 phonon while, when the
concavity is downwards, it is the Landau-Khalatnikov process 2 phonons
$\leftrightarrow$ 2 phonons. In both cases, by rescaling the wave vectors to
absorb the dependence on the interaction strength, we obtain a universal
formula for the damping rate. This universal formula corrects and extends the
original analytic results of Landau and Khalatnikov [ZhETF {\bf 19}, 637

presence of an excess of salt), chain flexibility promotes easy wrapping around
nanoparticles in excess hence ramified structures with $D_f \sim 2$. (ii) For
$0.3<L_T /R\le1$ (semiflexible chitosan or hyaluronan complexes), chain
stiffness promotes the formation of one-dimensional nanorods (in excess of
nanoparticles), in good agreement with computer simulations. (iii) For $L_T
/R>1$, $L_e$ is strongly increased due to the absence of salt and repulsions
between nanoparticles cannot be compensated by the polyelectrolyte wrapping,
which allow a spacing between nanoparticles and the formation of one
dimensional pearl necklace complexes. (iv) Finally, electrostatic 2 screening,

the last few years. They were initially conceived for image categorization,
i.e., the problem of assigning a semantic label to an entire input image.
  In this paper we address the problem of dense semantic labeling, which
consists in assigning a semantic label to every pixel in an image. Since this
requires a high spatial accuracy to determine where labels are assigned,
categorization CNNs, intended to be highly robust to local deformations, are
not directly applicable.
  By adapting categorization networks, many semantic labeling CNNs have been
recently proposed. Our first contribution is an in-depth analysis of these
architectures. We establish the desired properties of an ideal semantic
labeling CNN, and assess how those methods stand with regard to these
properties. We observe that even though they provide competitive results, these
CNNs often underexploit properties of semantic labeling that could lead to more
effective and efficient architectures.
  Out of these observations, we then derive a CNN framework specifically
adapted to the semantic labeling problem. In addition to learning features at
different resolutions, it learns how to combine these features. By integrating
local and global information in an efficient and flexible manner, it
outperforms previous techniques. We evaluate the proposed framework and compare
it with state-of-the-art architectures on public benchmarks of high-resolution
aerial image labeling.

directly from the hydrodynamic equations as representing their weak exact

first time that the effect of a sphere rotation on the vortices interaction is
accounted for in exact form. We show that only the stream function of a vortex
pair of antipodal vortices (APV), and only it satisfies the original
three-dimensional hydrodynamics equations on a sphere. We prove that only APV
pair with two point vortices in the diameter-conjugated points of a sphere with
equal by quantity but different sign circulations may be correctly considered
as an elementary (stationary, not self-affecting) singular point object on a
sphere. We suggest using the axis connecting the two point vortices in an APV
for describing of an axis of rotation of the global vortices introduced in
(Barrett, 1958) to reflect the observed global rotation of atmospheric masses
with the rotation axes not coinciding with the planet rotation axis and
precessing about it. Up to now, the question about interaction of global
vortices corresponding to such solutions with rotations about different axis
was not even posed. This is the first model describing interaction of the
Barrett-type global vortices corresponding to atmospheric centers of action
(ACA). The new steady-state and its stability conditions for N=2 are obtained
and used for the analysis of coupled cyclone-anticyclone ACAs over oceans in
the Northern Hemisphere. On the base of corresponding exact solutions, we show
acceptability of modelling of the stable blocks of splitting flow type when in

running digital tape whose symbols interact sequentially with the machine. As
has been shown in earlier work, this finite-state machine can act as a demon
(with memory), which creates a net flow of energy from the heat reservoir into
the work reservoir (thus extracting useful work) at the price of increasing the
entropy of the information reservoir. Under very few assumptions, we propose a
simple derivation of a family of inequalities that relate the work extraction
with the entropy production. These inequalities can be seen as either upper
bounds on the extractable work or as lower bounds on the entropy production,
depending on the point of view. Many of these bounds are relatively easy to
calculate and they are tight in the sense that equality can be approached
arbitrarily closely. In their basic forms, these inequalities are applicable to
any finite number of cycles (and not only asymptotically), and for a general
input information sequence (possibly correlated), which is not necessarily
assumed even stationary. Several known results are obtained as special cases.

models while keeping lower levels of overfitting. However, the most prevalent
regularizations do not leverage all the capacity of the models since they rely
on reducing the effective number of parameters. Feature decorrelation is an
alternative for using the full capacity of the models but the overfitting
reduction margins are too narrow given the overhead it introduces. In this
paper, we show that regularizing negatively correlated features is an obstacle
for effective decorrelation and present OrthoReg, a novel regularization
technique that locally enforces feature orthogonality. As a result, imposing
locality constraints in feature decorrelation removes interferences between
negatively correlated feature weights, allowing the regularizer to reach higher
decorrelation bounds, and reducing the overfitting more effectively. In
particular, we show that the models regularized with OrthoReg have higher
accuracy bounds even when batch normalization and dropout are present.
Moreover, since our regularization is directly performed on the weights, it is
especially suitable for fully convolutional neural networks, where the weight
space is constant compared to the feature map space. As a result, we are able
to reduce the overfitting of state-of-the-art CNNs on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and

Collaboration show strong deviations from a skellam distribution, which should
describe thermal properties of cumulant ratios, if proton-number fluctuations
are generated in equilibrium and a hadron resonance gas (HRG) model would
provide a suitable description of thermodynamics at the freeze-out temperature.
We present some results on sixth order cumulants entering the calculation of
the QCD equation of state at non-zero values of the baryon chemical potential
(mu_B) and discuss limitations on the applicability of HRG thermodynamics
deduced from a comparison between QCD and HRG model calculations of cumulants
of conserved charge fluctuations. We show that basic features of the
$\mu_B$-dependence of skewness and kurtosis ratios of net proton-number

O(mu_B^2) QCD calculation of the corresponding net baryon-number cumulant

the user in navigating through the items that are most relevant to her needs.
In a typical Web site, long history of previous activities or purchases by the
user is rarely available. Hence in most cases, recommenders propose items that
are similar to the most recent ones viewed in the current user session. The
corresponding task is called session based item-to-item recommendation. For
frequent items, it is easy to present item-to-item recommendations by ""people
who viewed this, also viewed"" lists. However, most of the items belong to the
long tail, where previous actions are sparsely available. Another difficulty is
the so-called cold start problem, when the item has recently appeared and had
no time yet to accumulate sufficient number of transactions. In order to
recommend a next item in a session in sparse or cold start situations, we also
have to incorporate item similarity models. In this paper we describe a
probabilistic similarity model based on Random Fields to approximate
item-to-item transition probabilities. We give a generative model for the item
interactions based on arbitrary distance measures over the items including
explicit, implicit ratings and external metadata. The model may change in time
to fit better recent events and recommend the next item based on the updated
Fisher Information. Our new model outperforms both simple similarity baseline
methods and recent item-to-item recommenders, under several different
performance metrics and publicly available data sets. We reach significant
gains in particular for recommending a new item following a rare item.

whose members $\Omega_{m}(t)$ ($1 \leq m < \infty$) are made up from the
respective sum of the $L^{2m}$-norms of vorticity and the density gradient.
Each $\Omega_{m}(t)$ has a lower bound in terms of the inverse Rossby number,
$Ro^{-1}$, that turns out to be crucial to the argument. For convenience, the
$\Omega_{m}$ are also scaled into a new set of variables $D_{m}(t)$. By
assuming the existence and uniqueness of solutions, conditional upper bounds
are found on the $D_{m}(t)$ in terms of $Ro^{-1}$ and the Reynolds number $Re$.
These upper bounds vary across bands in the $\{D_{1},\,D_{m}\}$ phase plane.
The boundaries of these bands depend subtly upon $Ro^{-1}$, $Re$, and the
inverse Froude number $Fr^{-1}$. For example, solutions in the lower band
conditionally live in an absorbing ball in which the maximum value of

homogeneous bodies that are characterized by linear constitutive equations in
the frequency domain. By working with the Cartesian components of the electric,
E and magnetic, H fields and with the scalar functions (r*E) and (r*H), the
problem is cast as solving a set of scalar Helmholtz equations for the field
components that are coupled by the usual electromagnetic boundary conditions at
material boundaries. This facilitates a direct solution for E and H rather than
working with surface currents as intermediate quantities in existing methods.
Consequently, our formulation is free of the well-known numerical instability
that occurs in the zero frequency or long wavelength limit in traditional
surface integral solutions of Maxwell's equations and our numerical results
converge uniformly to the static results in the long wavelength limit.
Furthermore, we use a formulation of the scalar Helmholtz equation that is
expressed as classically convergent integrals and does not require the
evaluation of principal value integrals or any knowledge of the solid angle.
Therefore, standard quadrature and higher order surface elements can readily be
used to improve numerical precision. In addition, near and far field values can
be calculated with equal precision and multiscale problems in which the
scatterers possess characteristic length scales that are both large and small
relative to the wavelength can be easily accommodated. From this we obtain
results for the scattering and transmission of electromagnetic waves at
dielectric boundaries that are valid for any ratio of the local surface
curvature to the wave number. This is a generalization of the familiar Fresnel
formula and Snell's law, valid at planar dielectric boundaries, for the
scattering and transmission of electromagnetic waves at surfaces of arbitrary
curvature.

easily distinguished from the other two scenarios as they predict the ratio to

eliminating the needs for fiber isolators. Our finding is enabled by the

annihilating two Weyl points by supercell modulation in a magnetic DG, we
obtain the photonic analogue of the 3D quantum Hall phase with a non-zero first

develop along the winding axis, with the number of modes determined by the
spatial frequency of the helix. These single-polarization single-mode and
multi-mode one-way fibers, having nearly identical group and phase velocities,
are topologically-protected by the second Chern number~($C_2$) in the 4D

of turbulence due to magnetorotational instability (MRI). However
magnetohydrodynamic simulations give the value of Shakura-Sunyaev parameter
more then an order of magnitude smaller rather than that found from
observations. One way to solve this problem is the existence of an alternative
or additional mechanism for generating turbulence. It can be the bypass
mechanism, which is responsible for transition to turbulence in Couette and
Poiseuille flows. This mechanism is based on the transient growth of linear
perturbations in the flow with the subsequent transition to the nonlinear
stage. In order to clarify the role of this mechanism in astrophysical disks
first of all it is necessary to calculate the maximal possible growth factor of
linear perturbations in the flow. In this paper the results of such
calculations are presented for perturbations on different scales compared with
the disk thickness. Qualitative description of mechanisms responsible for the
growth will also be presented. It was found that the most rapidly growing shear
harmonics have azimuthal wavelength of the order of the disk thickness. In
addition, their initial form is always similar to the vortex perturbations with
the same potential vorticity. It was shown that the vortices with azimuthal
wavelength more than an order of magnitude in excess of the disc thickness, are
still able to grow by dozens of times.

spectral resources contributed from both parties. In this paper, we consider a
spectrum sharing scenario where a number of OPs construct a spectrum pool
dedicated to support inter-operator D2D communication. OPs negotiate in the
form of a non-cooperative game about how much spectrum each OP contributes to
the spectrum pool. OPs submit proposals to each other in parallel until a
consensus is reached. When every OP has a concave utility function on the
box-constrained region, we identify the conditions guaranteeing the existence
of a unique equilibrium point. We show that the iterative algorithm based on
the OP's best response might not converge to the equilibrium point due to
myopically overreacting to the response of the other OPs, while the Jacobi-play
strategy update algorithm can converge with an appropriate selection of update
parameter. Using the Jacobi-play update algorithm, we illustrate that
asymmetric OPs contribute an unequal amount of resources to the spectrum pool;
However all participating OPs may experience significant performance gains

that for some problems, the algorithm used on interval graphs can also be used
with small modifications on cocomparability graphs. Many of these algorithms
are based on graph searches that preserve cocomparability orderings.
  First we propose a characterization of cocomparability graphs via a lattice
structure on the set of their maximal cliques. Using this characterization we
can prove that every maximal interval subgraph of a cocomparability graph $G$
is also a maximal chordal subgraph of $G$. Although the size of this lattice of
maximal cliques can be exponential in the size of the graph, it can be used as
a framework to design and prove algorithms on cocomparability graphs. In
particular we show that a new graph search, namely Local Maximal Neighborhood
Search (LocalMNS) leads to an $O(n+mlogn)$ time algorithm to find a maximal
interval subgraph of a cocomparability graph. Similarly we propose a linear
time algorithm to compute all simplicial vertices in a cocomparability graph.

decomposition of the boundary 2-sphere by two polar meridians, and a meridian
overlap of certain 2-cell faces in opposite hemispheres. The combinatorial
description is in terms of the Sturm permutation, alias the meander properties
of the shooting curve for the equilibrium ODE boundary value problem. It
involves the relative positioning of extreme 2-dimensionally unstable
equilibria at the Neumann boundaries $x=0$ and $x=1$, respectively, and the

underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The oscillations of the Sun are
known to vary with its activity cycle and these changes provide diagnostics on
the conditions below the photosphere. Kepler has detected oscillations in
hundreds of solar-like stars but as of yet, no widespread detection of
signatures of magnetic activity cycles in the oscillation parameters of these
stars have been reported.
  Aims. We analyse the photometric short cadence Kepler time series of a set of
24 solar-like stars, which were observed for at least 960 days each, with the
aim to find signatures of stellar magnetic activity in the oscillation
parameters.
  Methods. We analyse the temporal evolution of oscillation parameters by
measuring mode frequency shifts, changes in the height of the p-mode envelope,
as well as granulation time scales.
  Results. For 23 of the 24 investigated stars, we find significant frequency
shifts in time. We present evidence for magnetic activity in six of them. We
find that the amplitude of the frequency shifts decreases with stellar age and
rotation period. For the most prominent example, KIC 8006161, we find that,
similar to the solar case, frequency shifts are smallest for the lowest and
largest for the highest p-mode frequencies.
  Conclusions. These findings show that magnetic activity can be routinely
observed in the oscillation parameters for solar-like stars, which opens up the
possibility to place the solar activity cycle in the context of other stars by
asteroseismology.

residual ranges of a high number of concurrent proton tracks. The range of the
individual protons can at present be estimated with a resolution of 4%. The
readout system for this prototype is able to handle an effective proton
frequency of 1 MHz by using 500 concurrent proton tracks in each readout frame,
which is at the high end range of present similar prototypes. A future further

Starting from the homogeneous part of the evolution equations for the

parton distributions as the convolutions of the integrated double distributions
and the splitting functions, multiplied by the Sudakov form factors. We show
that there exist three domains of external hard scales which require three

transverse momentum dependence which arises through the Sudakov form factors
leads to non-trivial correlations in the parton momenta. We also discuss the
non-homogeneous contribution to the unintegrated double parton distributions,
which arises due to the splitting of a single parton into daughter partons with
high transverse momenta. We analyze two cases, the unfolding of the transverse
momenta dependence from the last step of the evolution of two partons, and the
case where the transverse momenta are generated directly from the single parton

1, focussing on the G band photometry. Aims. This paper describes the
calibration model of the Gaia photometric passband for Gaia Data Release 1.
Methods. The overall principle of splitting the process into internal and
external calibrations is outlined. In the internal calibration, a
self-consistent photometric system is generated. Then, the external calibration
provides the link to the absolute photometric flux scales. Results. The Gaia
photometric calibration pipeline explained here was applied to the first data
release with good results. Details are given of the various calibration
elements including the mathematical formulation of the models used and of the
extraction and preparation of the required input parameters (e.g. colour
terms). The external calibration in this first release provides the absolute
zero point and photometric transformations from the Gaia G passband to other
common photometric systems. Conclusions. This paper describes the photometric
calibration implemented for the first Gaia data release and the instrumental
effects taken into account. For this first release no aperture losses,
radiation damage, and other second-order effects have not yet been implemented

the interstellar medium (ISM) and is an important tracer of star formation.
Recent velocity-resolved studies with Herschel/HIFI and SOFIA/GREAT showed that
the [CII] line can constrain the properties of the ISM phases in star-forming
regions. The [CII] line as a tracer of star formation is particularly important
in low-metallicity environments where CO emission is weak because of the
presence of large amounts of CO-dark gas. The nearby irregular dwarf galaxy NGC
4214 offers an excellent opportunity to study an actively star-forming ISM at
low metallicity. We analyzed the spectrally resolved [CII] line profiles in
three distinct regions at different evolutionary stages of NGC 4214 with
respect to ancillary HI and CO data in order to study the origin of the [CII]
line. We used SOFIA/GREAT [CII] 158 um observations, HI data from THINGS, and
CO(2-1) data from HERACLES to decompose the spectrally resolved [CII] line
profiles into components associated with neutral atomic and molecular gas. We
use this decomposition to infer gas masses traced by [CII] under different ISM
conditions. Averaged over all regions, we associate about 46% of the [CII]
emission with the HI emission. However, we can assign only around 9% of the
total [CII] emission to the cold neutral medium (CNM). We found that about 79%
of the total molecular hydrogen mass is not traced by CO emission. On average,
the fraction of CO-dark gas dominates the molecular gas mass budget. The
fraction seems to depend on the evolutionary stage of the regions: it is
highest in the region covering a super star cluster in NGC 4214, while it is
lower in a more compact, more metal-rich region.

reliable machine learning systems. When machine learning is deployed in the
real world, its performance can be significantly degraded because test data may
follow a different distribution from training data. DRSL with f-divergences
explicitly considers the worst-case distribution shift by minimizing the
adversarially reweighted training loss. In this paper, we analyze this DRSL,
focusing on the classification scenario. Since the DRSL is explicitly
formulated for a distribution shift scenario, we naturally expect it to give a
robust classifier that can aggressively handle shifted distributions. However,
surprisingly, we prove that the DRSL just ends up giving a classifier that
exactly fits the given training distribution, which is too pessimistic. This
pessimism comes from two sources: the particular losses used in classification
and the fact that the variety of distributions to which the DRSL tries to be
robust is too wide. Motivated by our analysis, we propose simple DRSL that
overcomes this pessimism and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness.

during runtime. The selection process is based upon a reinforcement-learning
scheme, where prediction models are selected according to their prior
prediction performance. An additional selection process is concerned with
appropriately partitioning the control-inputs' domain in order to also allow
for switched-system approximations of the original bilinear dynamics. We show
analytically that the proposed scheme converges (in probability) to the best
model and partition. We finally demonstrate these properties through
simulations of temperature prediction in residential buildings.

from various sensors. A common choice is to use the WiFi adapter that provides
information about Access Points that can be found in the vicinity.
Unfortunately, state-of-the-art approaches to WiFi-based localization often
employ very dense maps of the WiFi signal distribution, and require a
time-consuming process of parameter selection. On the other hand, camera images
are commonly used for visual place recognition, detecting whenever the user
observes a scene similar to the one already recorded in a database. Visual
place recognition algorithms can work with sparse databases of recorded scenes
and are in general simple to parametrize. Therefore, we propose a WiFi-based
global localization method employing the structure of the well-known FAB-MAP
visual place recognition algorithm. Similarly to FAB-MAP our method uses
Chow-Liu trees to estimate a joint probability distribution of re-observation
of a place given a set of features extracted at places visited so far. However,
we are the first who apply this idea to recorded WiFi scans instead of visual
words. The new method is evaluated on the UJIIndoorLoc dataset used in the
EvAAL competition, allowing fair comparison with other solutions.

demonstrate that both distributions evolve with time beyond what is expected
from differential rotation. We also report that near the end of our

showing up as enhanced red-shifted emission in multiple spectral activity
proxies. With 3 different filtering techniques, we model the radial velocity

successfully retrieve the 68m/s RV planet signal hiding behind the jitter,
further confirm the existence of V830 Tau b and better characterize its orbital

properties of convex hull inclusion, variation diminution and intuitive

waves in the solar corona with the periods of 181, 69, and 40 seconds were
detected in UV observations. Using the wavelet technique we construct a new
type of map of oscillations for selected periods in the whole domain of the
radio spectrum. While the oscillation with the period of 181 seconds was
recognized in the whole 25-2000 MHz radio spectrum, oscillations with periods
of 69 and 40 seconds were confirmed only in the 250-870 MHz frequency range. In
the 800-2000 MHz range we found periods of 50 and 80 seconds. Moreover, in the
250-870 MHz frequency range, the oscillation with the period of about 420
seconds was detected. We also made maps of phases of the 181-second
oscillations in order to analyze their frequency drift. At the beginning of the
radio event, in the 2000-500 MHz frequency range the phase of the 181-second
oscillation drifts towards lower frequencies. On the other hand, at frequencies
25-500 MHz we found that the phase is nearly synchronous. While the phase drift
at higher frequencies can be interpreted as being caused by the UV wave, the
synchronization of the phase on lower frequencies is explained by the
fast-electron beams, whose acceleration is modulated by the UV wave. Owing to
this modulation, the electron beams are accelerated with the period of the UV
wave (181 seconds). These beams propagate upwards through the solar corona and
generate the 25-500 MHz radio emission with the 181-second period. Due to high
beam velocity (~c/3, where c is the light speed) the 25-500 MHz radio emission,
corresponding to a large interval of heights in the solar corona, is nearly

continuous measurement theory, we find that the leading orders of the
fluctuating detector output $z(t)$ with respect to the measurement strength
$\beta$ are a white shot noise background, a constant measurement offset, and
the leading order quantum noise of the measured operator $A$. Starting from
quantum expressions for the multi-time moments $\langle z(t_n)\cdots z(t_1)
\rangle$ we derive three- and four-time cumulants that are valid in all orders
of $\beta$ covering the full regime between the weak and strong measurement
limit (Zeno-limit). Intriguingly, quantum expressions for the cumulants were
found that exhibit the same simple structure as those for the moments after
introduction of only a slightly modified system propagator. Very compact
expressions for the cumulant-based third and fourth order spectra (bispectrum
and trispectrum) follow naturally. We illustrate the usefulness of higher order
spectra by treating a real world two-spin system with strong hyperfine
interaction.Moreover, spin noise spectroscopy is shown to have the potential
for investigating the transition from weak measurements to the famous quantum
Zeno regime for realistic probe laser intensities.

current activity going on in this area. The non-linearity is governed by a real

It is also well known that q-exponential behavior is found in quite different

601 (2009)] with reference to empirical scenarios in which data are collected
via set-ups that effect a normalization plus data's pre-processing. Precisely,
the ensuing normalized output was there shown to be q-exponentially distributed
if the input data display elliptical symmetry, generalization of spherical
symmetry, a frequent situation. This makes it difficult, for q-values close to
unity, to ascertain whether one is dealing with solutions to the ordinary
Schr\""odinger equation (whose free particle solutions are exponentials, and for
which $q=1$) or with its NRT nonlinear q-generalizations, whose free particle
solutions are q-exponentials. In this work we provide a careful analysis of the

annotations of Chinese clinical texts with corresponding annotation guidelines
and methods as well as to develop tools trained on the annotated corpus, which
supplies baselines for research on Chinese texts in the clinical domain.
  Materials and methods: An iterative annotation method was proposed to train
annotators and to develop annotation guidelines. Then, by using annotation
quality assurance measures, a comprehensive corpus was built, containing
annotations of part-of-speech (POS) tags, syntactic tags, entities, assertions,
and relations. Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was calculated to evaluate the
annotation quality and a Chinese clinical text processing and information
extraction system (CCTPIES) was developed based on our annotated corpus.
  Results: The syntactic corpus consists of 138 Chinese clinical documents with
47,424 tokens and 2553 full parsing trees, while the semantic corpus includes
992 documents that annotated 39,511 entities with their assertions and 7695
relations. IAA evaluation shows that this comprehensive corpus is of good
quality, and the system modules are effective.
  Discussion: The annotated corpus makes a considerable contribution to natural
language processing (NLP) research into Chinese texts in the clinical domain.
However, this corpus has a number of limitations. Some additional types of
clinical text should be introduced to improve corpus coverage and active
learning methods should be utilized to promote annotation efficiency.
  Conclusions: In this study, several annotation guidelines and an annotation
method for Chinese clinical texts were proposed, and a comprehensive corpus
with its NLP modules were constructed, providing a foundation for further study
of applying NLP techniques to Chinese texts in the clinical domain.

mechanism in the context of the linear covariant gauges. In particular, the
implementation of the Schwinger mechanism in pure Yang-Mills theories hinges
crucially on the inclusion of massless bound-state excitations in the
fundamental nonperturbative vertices of the theory. The dynamical formation of
such excitations is controlled by a homogeneous linear Bethe-Salpeter equation,
whose nontrivial solutions have been studied only in the Landau gauge. Here,
the form of this integral equation is derived for general values of the
gauge-fixing parameter, under a number of simplifying assumptions that reduce
the degree of technical complexity. The kernel of this equation consists of
fully-dressed gluon propagators, for which recent lattice data are used as
input, and of three-gluon vertices dressed by a single form factor, which is
modelled by means of certain physically motivated Ans\""atze. The
gauge-dependent terms contributing to this kernel impose considerable
restrictions on the infrared behavior of the vertex form factor; specifically,
only infrared finite Ans\""atze are compatible with the existence of nontrivial
solutions. When such Ans\""atze are employed, the numerical study of the
integral equation reveals a continuity in the type of solutions as one varies
the gauge-fixing parameter, indicating a smooth departure from the Landau
gauge. Instead, the logarithmically divergent form factor displaying the
characteristic ""zero crossing"", while perfectly consistent in the Landau gauge,
has to undergo a dramatic qualitative transformation away from it, in order to
yield acceptable solutions. The possible implications of these results are
briefly discussed.

strong broad line region emission defining this blazar class, and the resulting
high optical depth for VHE ($E>100\,$GeV) $\gamma$-rays, it was surprising to
detect VHE emission from such an object. In May 2015, PKS 1510-089 exhibited

especially the TeV emission, namely the low-frequeny peaked BL Lac object AP

parts of the spectral energy distribution follow the characteristics implied by
the source classification, the inverse Compton component spans 10 orders of
magnitude, which cannot be reproduced by the one-zone model. Additionally,
observational constraints in both the synchrotron and inverse Compton
compoenent strongly constrain the parameters of a self-consistent model ruling
out the possibility of TeV photon production in the vicinity of the galactic
center. We discuss the possibility that the TeV radiation is emitted by highly
energetic particles in the extended, arcsec-scale jet, which has been detected
at radio and X-ray energies. The slope of the jet X-ray spectrum indicates an
inverse Compton origin, and an extrapolation to higher energies coincides with
a break feature in the $\gamma$-ray band. Modeling the jet emission with
inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background results in an
excellent fit of the radio, X-ray and TeV emission. Implications will be
discussed, such as properties of the jet, acceleration scenarios, and

applications in the kinetic simulation of non-thermal plasmas. However, the
direct application of either time stepping schemes or iterative methods (such
as Krylov based methods like GMRES or relexation schemes) is computationally
expensive. In the former case the slowest timescale in the system forces us to
perform a long time integration while in the latter case a large number of
iterations is required. In this paper we propose a preconditioner based on an
ADI type splitting method. This preconditioner is then combined with both GMRES
and Richardson iteration. The resulting numerical schemes scale almost ideally
(i.e. the computational effort is proportional to the number of grid points).
Numerical simulations conducted show that this can result in a speedup of close
to two orders of magnitude (even for intermediate grid sizes) with respect to
the not preconditioned case. In addition, we discuss the characteristics of
these numerical methods and show the results for a number of numerical

nonlinear weakly dispersive model. First, using the phase space analysis
methods we describe all possible types of localized travelling waves. Then, we
especially focus on the critical regime, where the surface tension is exactly
balanced by the gravity force. We show that our long wave model with a critical
Bond number admits stable travelling wave solutions with a singular crest.
These solutions are usually referred to in the literature as peakons or peaked
solitary waves. They satisfy the usual speed-amplitude relation, which
coincides with Scott-Russel's empirical formula for solitary waves, while their
decay rate is the same regardless their amplitude. Moreover, they can be of
depression or elevation type independent of their speed. The dynamics of these
solutions are studied as well.

  working memory","37 pages, 9 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC nlin.PS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We analyze a multilayer neural field model of spatial working memory,
focusing on the impact of interlaminar connectivity, spatial heterogeneity, and
velocity inputs. Models of spatial working memory typically employ networks
that generate persistent activity via a combination of local excitation and
lateral inhibition. Our model is comprised of a multilayer set of equations
that describes connectivity between neurons in the same and different layers
using an integral term. The kernel of this integral term then captures the
impact of different interlaminar connection strengths, spatial heterogeneity,
and velocity input. We begin our analysis by focusing on how interlaminar
connectivity shapes the form and stability of (persistent) bump attractor
solutions to the model. Subsequently, we derive a low-dimensional approximation
that describes how spatial heterogeneity, velocity input, and noise combine to
determine the position of bump solutions. The main impact of spatial
heterogeneity is to break the translation symmetry of the network, so bumps
prefer to reside at one of a finite number of local attractors in the domain.
With the reduced model in hand, we can then approximate the dynamics of the
bump position using a continuous time Markov chain model that describes bump
motion between local attractors. While heterogeneity reduces the effective
diffusion of the bumps, it also disrupts the processing of velocity inputs by
slowing the velocity-induced propagation of bumps. However, we demonstrate that
noise can play a constructive role by promoting bump motion transitions,
restoring a mean bump velocity that is close to the input velocity.

cellular systems in these frequencies may provides orders of magnitude greater
capacity than networks in conventional lower frequency bands. However, due to
high susceptibility to blocking, mmWave links can be extremely intermittent in
quality. This combination of high peak throughputs and intermittency can cause
significant challenges in end-to-end transport-layer mechanisms such as TCP.
This paper studies the particularly challenging problem of bufferbloat.
Specifically, with current buffering and congestion control mechanisms, high
throughput-high variable links can lead to excessive buffers incurring long
latency. In this paper, we capture the performance trends obtained while
adopting two potential solutions that have been proposed in the literature:
Active queue management (AQM) and dynamic receive window. We show that, over
mmWave links, AQM mitigates the latency but cannot deliver high throughput. The
main reason relies on the fact that the current congestion control was not
designed to cope with high data rates with sudden change. Conversely, the
dynamic receive window approach is more responsive and therefore supports
higher channel utilization while mitigating the delay, thus representing a
viable solution.

achieving state-of-the-art results in various fields, including image
classification, speech recognition, and automated control. Both the performance
and computational complexity of such models are heavily dependant on the design
of characteristic hyper-parameters (e.g., number of hidden layers, nodes per
layer, or choice of activation functions), which have traditionally been
optimized manually. With machine learning penetrating low-power mobile and
embedded areas, the need to optimize not only for performance (accuracy), but
also for implementation complexity, becomes paramount. In this work, we present
a multi-objective design space exploration method that reduces the number of
solution networks trained and evaluated through response surface modelling.
Given spaces which can easily exceed 1020 solutions, manually designing a
near-optimal architecture is unlikely as opportunities to reduce network
complexity, while maintaining performance, may be overlooked. This problem is
exacerbated by the fact that hyper-parameters which perform well on specific
datasets may yield sub-par results on others, and must therefore be designed on
a per-application basis. In our work, machine learning is leveraged by training
an artificial neural network to predict the performance of future candidate
networks. The method is evaluated on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 image datasets,
optimizing for both recognition accuracy and computational complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can closely
approximate the Pareto-optimal front, while only exploring a small fraction of
the design space.

consequence of the excitation properties of each line, given that $J=1$ reaches
local thermal equilibrium (LTE) while $J=2$ is still sub-thermally excited in
the considered clouds. The bimodality of $R_{2-1/1-0}$ serves as a tracer of
the physical properties of different regions of the cloud and it helps
constrain local temperatures, densities and opacities. Additionally this
bimodal structure shows an important portion of the CO emission comes from
diffuse regions of the cloud, suggesting that the commonly used conversion
factor of $R_{2-1/1-0}\sim 0.7$ between both lines may need to be studied
further.

modelled through Fick's law, and a new constitutive relation for the mass flux
due to the potential gradient is proposed. In the regime of low screening the
response function due to the potential gradient is closely related to the ionic
conductivity. In the large screening regime, on the other hand, the response
function is governed by the charge-charge structure. Molecular dynamics
simulations are conducted and the two wave vector dependent response functions
are evaluated for models of a molten salt and an ionic liquid. In the low
screening regime the response functions show same wave vector dependency,
indicating that it is the same underlying physical processes that govern the

various scientific and engineering areas. For nonstiff systems, common explicit
integration algorithms can be used on GPUs, where individual GPU threads
concurrently integrate independent ODEs with different initial conditions or
parameters. One example is the fifth-order adaptive Runge-Kutta-Cash-Karp
(RKCK) algorithm. In the case of stiff ODEs, standard explicit algorithms
require impractically small time-step sizes for stability reasons, and implicit
algorithms are therefore commonly used instead to allow larger time steps and
reduce the computational expense. However, typical high-order implicit
algorithms based on backwards differentiation formulae (e.g., VODE, LSODE)
involve complex logical flow that causes severe thread divergence when
implemented on GPUs, limiting the performance. Therefore, alternate algorithms
are needed. A GPU-based Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) algorithm can handle
moderate levels of stiffness and performs significantly faster than not only an
equivalent CPU version but also a CPU-based implicit algorithm (VODE) based on
results shown in the literature. In this chapter, we present the mathematical
background, implementation details, and source code for the RKCK and RKC
algorithms for use integrating large numbers of independent systems of ODEs on

communication tools of human life in recent years make developers build ever
more complex smartphone applications. Gaming, navigation, video editing,
augmented reality, and speech recognition applications require considerable
computational power and energy. Although smart- phones have a wide range of
capabilities - GPS, WiFi, cameras - their inherent limitations - frequent
disconnections, mobility - and significant constraints - size, lower weights,
longer battery life - make difficult to exploiting their full potential to run
complex applications. Several research works have proposed solutions in
application offloading domain, but few ones concerning the highly changing
properties of the environment. To address these issues, we realize an automated
application offloading middleware, ACOMMA, with dynamic and re-adaptable
decision-making engine. The decision engine of ACOMMA is based on an ant-
inspired algorithm.

overcoming resistance to chemotherapy during the treatment of solid,
inaccessible human tumors. The main challenge of this technology is increasing
the local tumoral temperature with minimal side effects on the surrounding
healthy tissue. This work consists of an in vitro study that compared the
effect of hyperthermia in response to the application of exogenous heating
(EHT) sources with the corresponding effect produced by magnetic hyperthermia
(MHT) at the same target temperatures. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were
loaded with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and packed into dense pellets to
generate an environment that is crudely similar to that expected in solid
micro-tumors, and the above-mentioned protocols were applied to these cells.
These experiments showed that for the same target temperatures, MHT induces a
decrease in cell viability that is larger than the corresponding EHT, up to a
maximum difference of approximately 45\% at T = 46{\deg}C. An analysis of the
data in terms of temperature efficiency demonstrated that MHT requires an
average temperature that is 6{\deg}C lower than that required with EHT to
produce a similar cytotoxic effect. An analysis of electron microscopy images
of the cells after the EHT and MHT treatments indicated that the enhanced
effectiveness observed with MHT is associated with local cell destruction
triggered by the magnetic nano-heaters. The present study is an essential step
toward the development of innovative adjuvant anti-cancer therapies based on
local hyperthermia treatments using magnetic particles as nano-heaters.

early days of quantum mechanics. Recent years have witnessed a growing interest
in this long-standing question. Is the wave function ontic, directly
representing a state of reality, or epistemic, merely representing a state of
(incomplete) knowledge, or something else? If the wave function is not ontic,
then what, if any, is the underlying state of reality? If the wave function is
indeed ontic, then exactly what physical state does it represent? In this book,
I aim to make sense of the wave function in quantum mechanics and find the
ontological content of the theory. The book can be divided into three parts.
The first part addresses the question of the nature of the wave function
(Chapters 1-5). After giving a comprehensive and critical review of the
competing views of the wave function, I present a new argument for the ontic
view in terms of protective measurements. In addition, I also analyze the
origin of the wave function by deriving the free Schroedinger equation. The
second part analyzes the ontological meaning of the wave function (Chapters 6,
7). I propose a new ontological interpretation of the wave function in terms of
random discontinuous motion of particles, and give two main arguments
supporting this interpretation. The third part investigates whether the
suggested quantum ontology is complete in accounting for our definite
experience and whether it needs to be revised in the relativistic domain
(Chapters 8, 9).

non-computable position among natural phenomena. Non-computable consciousness
was previously analyzed on the basis of self-referential cyclical time. This
paper extends the cyclical model of vacuum observation and posits that choice,
or the experience of reality, may be expressed as the initial part of the
self-referencing loop, while the conscious awareness of the experience is the
other part of the loop. In particular, the inseparability of the two sides of
the loop is established through the cyclical time process, which bears a
resemblance to Heidegger's analysis of existence. The cyclical looping model is
also discussed in terms of Wittgenstein's analysis of language as attaching
semantic meaning, or continuous or infinite conscious awareness, to physical
reality. We also discuss the proposed model of subjectivity and cyclical time -
as opposed to objectivity and linear time - which may be considered similar to
Hebrew thought.

attacks, we are able to attribute individual attacks to joint causes and
vulnerabilities, as well as estimating the evolution of these vulnerabilities
over time. Specifically, we use hazard regression with a time-varying additive
hazard function parameterized in a generalized linear form. The activation
coefficients on each feature are continuous-time functions over time. We
formulate the problem of learning these functions as a constrained variational
maximum likelihood estimation problem with total variation penalty and show
that the optimal solution is a 0th order spline (a piecewise constant function)
with a finite number of known knots. This allows the inference problem to be
solved efficiently and at scale by solving a finite dimensional optimization
problem. Extensive experiments on real data sets show that our method
significantly outperforms Cox's proportional hazard model. We also conduct a
case study and verify that the fitted functions are indeed recovering
vulnerable features and real-life events such as the release of code to exploit
these features in hacker blogs.

We apply the anholonomic frame deformation method, AFDM, in order to decouple

allows us to find integral varieties of cosmological solutions determined by
generating functions, effective sources, integration functions and constants.
The coefficients of metrics and connections for such cosmological

chosen to generate observable (quasi)-periodic/ aperiodic/ fractal / stochastic

classes of solutions for anamorphic cosmology with LQG holonomy corrections.
Such solutions are characterized by nonlinear symmetries of generating
functions for generic off--diagonal cosmological metrics and generalized
connections, with possible nonholonomic constraints to Levi-Civita
configurations and diagonalizable metrics depending only on a time like
coordinate. We argue that anamorphic quasiperiodic cosmological models
integrate the concept of quantum discrete spacetime, with certain gravitational
QC-like vacuum and nonvacuum structures. And, that of a contracting universe
