$PbTe-PbS$/(001) $KCl$ with two-dimensional ordered misfit dislocation (MD)
networks across heteroboundaries (HB) are studied, and the obtained results are
compared with the corresponding data for $YBaCuO$. An analysis of the
fluctuational region showed that the pairing of electrons in SL takes place at
the sites of dislocation networks. In the region of SC fluctuations, the IVC
derivatives of point-contacts (PC) based on SL and HTS display a
metal-insulator transition associated with delocalization of carriers from the
vicinity of the structural elements responsible for the emergence of SC. The
critical current density in a superlattice is determined, and a mechanism is
proposed for formation of excess current on the IVC of PC based on SL and HTS.
The values of the energy gap $\Delta_0$ at low temperatures in units of $kT_c$
are found to be anomalously large for SL and HTS. For anisotropic
three-dimensional SL with a strong bond between two-dimensional SC planes, two
gaps emerge from the MD. For quasi-two-dimensional SL with a weak bond between
two-dimensional SC planes, the $\Delta(T)$ dependence is nonmonotonic, and the
fluctuation region for these SL and for HTS reveals a gap that is practically
independent of temperature. The IVC derivatives of a $Cu$-SL PC reveal an
oscillating structure which is restricted to an energy of $90\ meV$ and is
apparently associated with the electron-phonon interaction. It is assumed that
there is a similarity between the SC mechanisms in SL and HTS. pacs 73.40.Jn,

  CSIT","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1209.5807 by other authors",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, it has been shown that in a cache-enabled interference channel, the
storage at the transmit and receive sides are of equal value in terms of
Degrees of Freedom (DoF). This is derived by assuming full Channel State
Information at the Transmitter (CSIT). In this paper, we consider a more
practical scenario, where a training/feedback phase should exist for obtaining
CSIT, during which instantaneous channel state is not known to the
transmitters. This results in a combination of delayed and current CSIT
availability, called mixed CSIT. In this setup, we derive DoF of a
cache-enabled interference channel with mixed CSIT, which depends on the memory
available at transmit and receive sides as well as the training/feedback phase
duration. In contrast to the case of having full CSIT, we prove that, in our
setup, the storage at the receive side is more valuable than the one at the
transmit side. This is due to the fact that cooperation opportunities granted
by transmitters' caches are strongly based on instantaneous CSIT availability.
However, multi-casting opportunities provided by receivers' caches are robust
to such imperfection.

The middle Ti layer provides magnetic decoupling between two ferromagnetic GdN
and a place for nonequilibrium quasiparticle accumulation. The two GdN(1,2)
layers were deposited under different conditions to introduce coercive
contrast. The quasiparticle tunneling spectra has been measured at different
temperatures to understand the tunneling mechanism in these double spin-filter
junctions. The conductance spectra were found to be comparable to an asymmetric
SINI'S-type tunnel junction. A hysteretic R-H loop with higher resistance for
the antiparallel configuration compared to parallel state was observed
asserting the spin-polarized nature of quasiparticles. The hysteresis in the
R-H loop was found to disappear for sub-gap bias current. This difference can

balance between dispersion and nonlinearity as well as dissipation and a
driving force. They occur in a wide variety of fields ranging from optics,
hydrodynamics to chemistry and biology. Recently, significant interest has
focused on their temporal realization in driven optical microresonators, known
as dissipative Kerr solitons. They provide access to coherent, chip-scale
optical frequency combs, which have already been employed in optical metrology,
data communication and spectroscopy. Such Kerr resonator systems can exhibit
numerous localized intracavity patterns and provide rich insights into
nonlinear dynamics. A particular class of solutions consists of breathing
dissipative solitons, representing pulses with oscillating amplitude and
duration, for which no comprehensive understanding has been presented to date.
Here, we observe and study single and multiple breathing dissipative solitons
in two different microresonator platforms: crystalline $\mathrm{MgF_2}$
resonator and $\mathrm{Si_3N_4}$ integrated microring. We report a
deterministic route to access the breathing state, which allowed for a detailed
exploration of the breathing dynamics. In particular, we establish the link
between the breathing frequency and two system control parameters - effective
pump laser detuning and pump power. Using a fast detection, we present a direct
observation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual solitons, revealing
irregular oscillations and switching. An understanding of breathing solitons is
not only of fundamental interest concerning nonlinear systems close to critical
transition, but also relevant for applications to prevent breather-induced
instabilities in soliton-based frequency combs.

will form a binary in the remnant core. The early evolution of the massive
binary is driven by dynamical friction before the binary becomes ""hard"" and
eventually reaches coalescence through gravitational wave emission. { We
consider the dynamical friction evolution of massive binaries consisting of a
secondary hole orbiting inside a stellar cusp dominated by a more massive
central black hole.} In our treatment we include the frictional force from
stars moving faster than the inspiralling object which is neglected in the
standard Chandrasekhar's treatment. We show that the binary eccentricity
increases if the stellar cusp density profile rises less steeply than
$\rho\propto r^{-2}$. In cusps shallower than $\rho\propto r^{-1}$ the
frictional timescale can become very long due to the deficit of stars moving
slower than the massive body. Although including the fast stars increases the
decay rate, low mass-ratio binaries ($q\lesssim 10^{-3}$) in sufficiently
massive galaxies have decay timescales longer than one Hubble time. During such
minor mergers the secondary hole stalls on an eccentric orbit at a distance of
order one tenth the influence radius of the primary hole (i.e., $\approx
10-100\rm pc$ for massive ellipticals). We calculate the expected number of
stalled satellites as a function of the host galaxy mass, and show that the
brightest cluster galaxies should have $\gtrsim 1$ of such satellites orbiting

Br$\gamma$ images of K 4-47 and NGC 7662, obtained using the Near InfraRed
Imager and Spectrometer (NIRI) at Gemini-North, are analyzed here. K 4-47
reveals a remarkable highly collimated bipolar structure not only in the
optical but also in the molecular hydrogen emission. The H$_2$ emission
emanates from the walls of the bipolar outflows and also from the pair of knots
at the tip of the outflows. The H$_2$ 1-0 S(1)/2-1 S(1) line ratio ranges from
~7 to ~10 suggesting the presence of shock interactions. Our findings can be
explained by the interaction of a jet/bullet ejected from the central star with
the surrounding asymptotic giant branch material. The strongest H$_2$ line,
v=1-0 S(1) is also detected in several low-ionization knots located at the
periphery of the elliptical planetary nebula NGC 7662, but only four of these
knots are detected in the H$_2$ v=2-1 S(1) line. These four knots exhibit an
H$_2$ line ratio between 2 and 3.5, which suggests that the emission is caused
by the UV ionizing flux of the central star. Our data confirms the presence of
H$_2$ gas in both fast- and slow-moving low-ionization knots, which has only
been confirmed before in the nearby Helix nebula and Hu 1-2. Overall, the
low-ionization structures of planetary nebulae are found to share similar
traits to photodissociation regions.

instrument is known for its very low speed and not being suitable for scanning
large areas, resulting in very-low-throughput measurement. We address this
challenge by parallelizing AFM instruments. The parallelization is achieved by
miniaturizing the AFM instrument and operating many of them simultaneously.
This nanoinstrument has the advantages that each miniaturized AFM can be
operated independently and that the advances in the field of AFM, both in terms
of speed and imaging modalities, can be implemented more easily. Moreover, a
parallel AFM instrument also allows one to measure several physical parameters
simultaneously; while one instrument measures nano-scale topography, another
instrument can measure mechanical, electrical or thermal properties, making it
a Lab-on-an-Instrument. In this paper, a proof of principle (PoP) of such a
parallel AFM instrument has been demonstrated by analyzing the topography of
large samples such as semiconductor wafers. This nanoinstrument provides new
research opportunities in the nanometrology of wafers and nanolithography masks
by enabling real die-to-die and wafer-level measurements and in cell biology by

performed three different types of tasks with nine diagrams of each property

agents with different utilities so that each agent believes they have received
a fair share of the resource relative to the other agents. We introduce a
variant of the problem in which we model an underlying social network on the
agents with a graph, and agents only evaluate their shares relative to their
neighbors' in the network. This formulation captures many situations in which
it is unrealistic to assume a global view, and also exposes interesting
phenomena in the original problem.
  Specifically, we say an allocation is locally envy-free if no agent envies a
neighbor's allocation and locally proportional if each agent values her own
allocation as much as the average value of her neighbor's allocations, with the
former implying the latter. While global envy-freeness implies local
envy-freeness, global proportionality does not imply local proportionality, or
vice versa. A general result is that for any two distinct graphs on the same
set of nodes and an allocation, there exists a set of valuation functions such
that the allocation is locally proportional on one but not the other.
  We fully characterize the set of graphs for which an oblivious single-cutter
protocol-- a protocol that uses a single agent to cut the cake into pieces
--admits a bounded protocol with $O(n^2)$ query complexity for locally
envy-free allocations in the Robertson-Webb model. We also consider the price
of envy-freeness, which compares the total utility of an optimal allocation to
the best utility of an allocation that is envy-free. We show that a lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ on the price of envy-freeness for global allocations in
fact holds for local envy-freeness in any connected undirected graph. Thus,
sparse graphs surprisingly do not provide more flexibility with respect to the
quality of envy-free allocations.

which can reduce peak traffic rates by pre-fetching popular content at the end
users and encoding transmissions so that different users can extract different
information from the same packet. On one hand, distributed storage limits the
capability of combining content from different servers into a single message,
causing performance losses in coded caching schemes. But, on the other hand,
the inherent redundancy existing in distributed storage systems can be used to
improve the performance of those schemes through parallelism.
  This paper designs a scheme combining distributed storage of the content in

scenario for the underdoped phase of the Cuprate superconductors. The SU(2)
symmetry is formulated as a rotation between the $d$-wave SC phase and a
$d$-wave charge order. We define the operators responsible for the SU(2)
rotations and we derive the non-linear $\sigma$-model associated with it. In
this framework, we demonstrate that SU(2) fluctuations are massless in finite
portions of the Brillouin Zone corresponding to the anti-nodal regions
($0,$$\pi$), ($\pi,0$). We argue that the presence of SU(2) fluctuations in the
anti-nodal region leads to the opening of Fermi arcs around the Fermi surface
and to the formation of the pseudo-gap. Moreover, we show that SU(2)
fluctuations lead, in turn, to the emergence of a finite momentum SC order -or
Pair Density Wave (PDW)- and more importantly to a new kind of excitonic
particle-hole pairs liquid, the Resonant Excitonic State (RES), which is made
of patches of preformed particle-hole pairs with multiple momenta. When the RES
liquid becomes critical, we demonstrate that electronic scattering through the
critical modes leads to anomalous transport properties. This new finding can
account for the Strange Metal (SM) phase at finite temperature, on the right
hand side of the SC dome, shedding light on another notoriously mysterious part
of the phase diagram of the Cuprates.

femtosecond laser pulse may become a versatile tool enabling control of
magnetic state of thin films and nanostructures via inverse magnetostriction on
a picosecond time scale. Here we explore two alternative approaches to
manipulate magnetocrystalline anisotropy and excite magnetization precession in
a low-symmetry film of a magnetic metallic alloy galfenol (Fe,Ga) either by
injecting picosecond strain pulse into it from a substrate or by generating
dynamical strain of complex temporal profile in the film directly. In the
former case we realize ultrafast excitation of magnetization dynamics solely by
strain pulses. In the latter case optically-generated strain emerged abruptly
in the film modifies its magnetocrystalline anisotropy, competing with
heat-induced change of anisotropy parameters. We demonstrate that the
optically-generated strain remains efficient for launching magnetization
precession, when the heat-induced changes of anisotropy parameters do not
trigger the precession anymore. We emphasize that in both approaches the
ultrafast change of magnetic anisotropy mediating the precession excitation
relies on mixed, compressive and shear, character of the dynamical strain,
which emerges due to low-symmetry of the metallic film under study.

Component Analysis (PCA) method applied to two-particle azimuthal correlations
extracted from the model calculations, the leading and the sub-leading flow
modes are studied as a function of the transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) over a
wide centrality range. The leading modes of the elliptic ($v^{(1)}_{2}$) and
triangular ($v^{(1)}_{3}$) flow calculated within the HYDJET++ model reproduce
rather well the $v_{2}\{2\}$ and $v_{3}\{2\}$ coefficients experimentally
measured using the two-particle correlations. Within the $p_{T} \le $~3~GeV/c
range where hydrodynamics dominates, the sub-leading flow effects are greatest
at the highest $p_{T}$ of around 3~GeV/c. The sub-leading elliptic flow mode
($v^{(2)}_{2}$), which corresponds to $n = 2$ harmonic, has a small non-zero
value and slowly increases from central to peripheral collisions, while the
sub-leading triangular flow mode ($v^{(2)}_{3}$), which corresponds to $n = 3$
harmonic, is even smaller and does not depend on centrality. For $n = $~2, the
relative magnitude of the effect measured with respect to the leading flow mode
shows a shallow minimum for semi-central collisions and increases for very
central and for peripheral collisions. For $n = $~3 case, there is no
centrality dependence. The sub-leading flow mode results obtained from the
HYDJET++ model are in a rather good agreement with the experimental
measurements of the CMS Collaboration.

theoretically predicted in perturbative QCD for hard exclusive hadron

that $\Lambda (1405)$ could be five-quark state or a $\bar K N$ molecule, and
scaling properties should be different between the ordinary three-quark state
or five-quark one. We predict such a difference in $\pi^- + p \to K^0 + \Lambda

a five-quark state at medium energies and a three-quark one at high energies.

conclusion, and it should be done at JLab by using the updated 12 GeV electron
beam. Furthermore, we discuss studies of exotic hadron candidates, such as $f_0

ion acceleration have been studied in near critical density plasmas.
Particle-in-cell simulations show that both the speed of laser-driven
collisionless electrostatic shock and the energies of shock-accelerated ions
can be greatly enhanced due to fast laser propagation in near critical density
plasmas. However, a response time longer than tens of laser wave cycles is
required before the shock formation in a near critical density plasma, in
contrast to the quick shock formation in a highly overdense target. More
important, we find that some ions can be reflected by the collisionless shock
even if the electrostatic potential jump across the shock is smaller than the
ion kinetic energy in the shock frame, which seems against the conventional
ion-reflection condition. These anomalous ion reflections are attributed to the
strongly time-oscillating electric field accompanying laser-driven
collisionless shock in a near critical density plasma.

spaces, and there are still many intriguing open questions concerning them,
especially the slope question. The topological characterization of Kodaira
fibrations is emblematic of the use of topological methods in the study of
moduli spaces of surfaces and higher dimensional complex algebraic varieties,
and their compactifications. The paper contains some new results but is mostly
a survey paper, dealing with fibrations, questions on monodromy and
factorizations in the mapping class group, old and new results on Variation of
Hodge Structures, especially a recent answer given (in joint work with
Dettweiler) to a long standing question posed by Fujita. In the landscape of
our tour, Galois coverings, deformations and rigid manifolds (new results
obtained with Ingrid Bauer) projective classifying spaces, the action of the
absolute Galois group on moduli spaces, stand also in the forefront. These
questions lead to interesting algebraic surfaces, for instance the BCDH
surfaces, hypersurfaces in Bagnera-de Franchis varieties, Inoue-type surfaces.

microscopy is the projection of many heterogeneous instances of the object
under study (e.g., a virus). When the object is heterogeneous but has an
overall symmetry, it is natural to describe the object as stochastic with
symmetrical statistics. This paper presents a maximum likelihood reconstruction
approach which allows each object to lack symmetry while constraining the {\it

demonstrated on bacteriophage HK97 and is contrasted with an existing algorithm
in which each object, while still heterogeneous, has the symmetry.
Reconstruction results show that the proposed algorithm eliminates
long-standing distortions in previous heterogeneity calculations associated
with symmetry axes, and provides estimates that make more biologically sense

quantum level. The thesis consists of two parts. First one treats about the
electroweak sector of the model. Among others, it identifies the parameter
region allowed by the electroweak precision observables. Since the MRSSM
contains an $SU(2)_L$-triplet with a non-zero vacuum expectation value the
emphasis is put on the calculation of the $W$ boson mass. To that end, a full
one-loop calculation of $m_W$ augmented with the leading two-loop SM result is
presented. The region is then checked against the measurement of the Higgs
boson mass. For this, the full one-loop and leading two-loop corrections to the
Higgs boson mass in the MRSSM are calculated. Devised benchmark points,
consistent with both of these observables, are shown to fulfill also a number
of additional experimental constraints like properties of the Higgs boson(s),
$b$-physics observables and vacuum stability. Correlating all of these
observables allows to put bounds on the parameters of the model. Second part of
the thesis treats about the strongly interacting scalar sector. First, NLO QCD
corrections to the production of scalar gluon (sgluon) pair at the LHC are
calculated. A set of $K$-factors for a selected sgluon masses at 13 and 14 TeV
LHC is presented. This calculation is applied to constrain the sgluon mass
using 2015 data set from Run 2 of the LHC. To that end, a same-sign lepton
search by ATLAS is recasted for the case of the production of the sgluon pair
decaying to $t\bar{t}$ pairs. The analysis is reproduced with the help of
shower Monte Carlo softwares and the program performing a fast detector

products and services. However, review hosting sites are often targeted by
opinion spamming. In recent years, many such sites have put a great deal of
effort in building effective review filtering systems to detect fake reviews
and to block malicious accounts. Thus, fraudsters or spammers now turn to
compromise, purchase or even raise reputable accounts to write fake reviews.
Based on the analysis of a real-life dataset from a review hosting site
(dianping.com), we discovered that reviewers' posting rates are bimodal and the
transitions between different states can be utilized to differentiate spammers
from genuine reviewers. Inspired by these findings, we propose a two-mode
Labeled Hidden Markov Model to detect spammers. Experimental results show that
our model significantly outperforms supervised learning using linguistic and
behavioral features in identifying spammers. Furthermore, we found that when a
product has a burst of reviews, many spammers are likely to be actively
involved in writing reviews to the product as well as to many other products.
We then propose a novel co-bursting network for detecting spammer groups. The
co-bursting network enables us to produce more accurate spammer groups than the
current state-of-the-art reviewer-product (co-reviewing) network.

order, as well as paramagnetic state have been explored. In monolayer FeSe,
collinear AFM order is found to be the most stable order, in accordance with
previous investigations. Substituting half Se atoms with Te atoms, the
pair-checkerboard AFM order is the ground-state magnetic order in
FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$. Both AFM-ordered FeSe and FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ have
Dirac-cone-like band structures. SOC has a great influence on the band
structures at the Dirac cone. The direction of the magnetic moments (in-plane

SOC, and the gap values also relate to the specific magnetic structure.
Although SOC is stronger in FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$, the SOC-induced band gaps

low-light environments. However, most face datasets accessible for training and
verification are only collected in the VIS (visible light) spectrum. It remains
a challenging problem to match NIR to VIS face images due to the different
light spectrum. Recently, breakthroughs have been made for VIS face recognition
by applying deep learning on a huge amount of labeled VIS face samples. The
same deep learning approach cannot be simply applied to NIR face recognition
for two main reasons: First, much limited NIR face images are available for
training compared to the VIS spectrum. Second, face galleries to be matched are
mostly available only in the VIS spectrum. In this paper, we propose an
approach to extend the deep learning breakthrough for VIS face recognition to
the NIR spectrum, without retraining the underlying deep models that see only
VIS faces. Our approach consists of two core components, cross-spectral
hallucination and low-rank embedding, to optimize respectively input and output
of a VIS deep model for cross-spectral face recognition. Cross-spectral
hallucination produces VIS faces from NIR images through a deep learning
approach. Low-rank embedding restores a low-rank structure for faces deep
features across both NIR and VIS spectrum. We observe that it is often equally
effective to perform hallucination to input NIR images or low-rank embedding to
output deep features for a VIS deep model for cross-spectral recognition. When
hallucination and low-rank embedding are deployed together, we observe
significant further improvement; we obtain state-of-the-art accuracy on the
CASIA NIR-VIS v2.0 benchmark, without the need at all to re-train the

  Two-dimensional Max Pooling","11 pages",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is one of the most popular architectures used
in Natural Language Processsing (NLP) tasks because its recurrent structure is
very suitable to process variable-length text. RNN can utilize distributed
representations of words by first converting the tokens comprising each text
into vectors, which form a matrix. And this matrix includes two dimensions: the
time-step dimension and the feature vector dimension. Then most existing models
usually utilize one-dimensional (1D) max pooling operation or attention-based
operation only on the time-step dimension to obtain a fixed-length vector.
However, the features on the feature vector dimension are not mutually
independent, and simply applying 1D pooling operation over the time-step
dimension independently may destroy the structure of the feature
representation. On the other hand, applying two-dimensional (2D) pooling
operation over the two dimensions may sample more meaningful features for
sequence modeling tasks. To integrate the features on both dimensions of the
matrix, this paper explores applying 2D max pooling operation to obtain a
fixed-length representation of the text. This paper also utilizes 2D
convolution to sample more meaningful information of the matrix. Experiments
are conducted on six text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis,
question classification, subjectivity classification and newsgroup
classification. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, the proposed models
achieve excellent performance on 4 out of 6 tasks. Specifically, one of the
proposed models achieves highest accuracy on Stanford Sentiment Treebank binary
classification and fine-grained classification tasks.

  Simplicial Plates","12 pages, 6 figures",,,,"math.CO math-ph math.MP math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we announce results from our thesis, which studies for the
first time the categorification of the theory of generalized permutohedra. The
vector spaces in the categorification are tightly constrained by certain
continuity relations which appeared in physics in the mid 20th century. We
describe here the action of the symmetric group on the vector spaces in this
categorification. Generalized permutohedra are replaced by vector spaces of
characteristic functions of polyhedral cones about faces of permutohedra,
called plates, due to A. Ocneanu. The symmetric group acts on plates by
coordinate permutation.
  In combinatorics, the Eulerian numbers count the number of permutations with
a given number of ascent and descents. The classical Worpitzky identity expands
a power $r^p$ as a sum of Eulerian numbers, with binomial coefficients. In our
thesis, for the main result we generalize the classical Worpitzky identity to
an isomorphism of symmetric group modules, corresponding geometrically to the
tiling of a scaled simplex by unit hypersimplices. In the categorification, the
volume of a hypersimplex is replaced by the complex-linear dimension of a
vector space associated to it. The main technical aspect of the proof of the
character formula for the simplex involves a partition of unity of a
commutative algebra of translations on a discrete torus, and a certain modular
Diophantine equation.
  A detailed paper is in preparation.

  The main tool used is the Grothendieck correspondence which gives a bijection

generalized Lam\'e equations with finite monodromy as pullbacks of the
hypergeometric equations. In this paper, we will restrict our cases with the
assumption that the pullback maps are Belyi functions. Under this setup, our

  Learning","14 pages, 9 tables, 9 figures, accepted by IEEE TKDE",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network representation learning (NRL) aims to learn low-dimensional vectors
for vertices in a network. Most existing NRL methods focus on learning
representations from local context of vertices (such as their neighbors).
Nevertheless, vertices in many complex networks also exhibit significant global
patterns widely known as communities. It's intuitive that vertices in the same
community tend to connect densely and share common attributes. These patterns
are expected to improve NRL and benefit relevant evaluation tasks, such as link
prediction and vertex classification. Inspired by the analogy between network
representation learning and text modeling, we propose a unified NRL framework
by introducing community information of vertices, named as Community-enhanced
Network Representation Learning (CNRL). CNRL simultaneously detects community
distribution of each vertex and learns embeddings of both vertices and
communities. Moreover, the proposed community enhancement mechanism can be
applied to various existing NRL models. In experiments, we evaluate our model
on vertex classification, link prediction, and community detection using
several real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that CNRL significantly
and consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods while verifying our
assumptions on the correlations between vertices and communities.

significant diffuse radio emission in and around the cluster. An upper limit of
the total radio power at 1.4 GHz is $\sim 1.1 \times 10^{22}$ Watt/Hz in $30$
square arcminutes which is a typical size of radio relics. It is known that an
empirical relation holds between the total radio power and X-ray luminosity of
the host cluster. The upper limit is about one order of magnitude lower than
the power expected from the relation. Very young ($\sim 70$ Myr) shocks with
low Mach numbers ($\sim 1.3$), which are often seen at an early stage of merger
simulations, are suggested by the previous X-ray observation. The shocks may
generate cosmic-ray electrons with a steep energy spectrum, which is consistent
with non-detection of bright ($>10^{23}$ Watt/Hz) relic in this 16 cm band

STOC'12], we apply our analysis of the set disjointness function to establish a
gap between the two different notions of the prior-free information cost. This
implies that amortized randomized communication complexity is not necessarily
equal to the amortized distributional communication complexity with respect to
the hardest distribution.

a great opportunity to clarify the general origin of dust in the Universe, not
biased to very bright special objects even at $z>6$. To clarify what constraint
we can get for the dust enrichment in normal galaxies detected by ALMA, we use
a theoretical model that includes major processes driving dust evolution in a
galaxy; that is, dust condensation in stellar ejecta, dust growth by the
accretion of gas-phase metals, and supernova destruction. Using the dust
emission fluxes detected in two normal galaxies at $z>6$ by ALMA as a
constraint, we can get the range of the time-scales (or efficiencies) of the
above mentioned processes. We find that if we assume extremely high
condensation efficiency in stellar ejecta ($f_{\mathrm{in}} \ga 0.5$), rapid
dust enrichment by stellar sources in the early phase may be enough to explain
the observed ALMA flux, unless dust destruction by supernovae in those galaxies
is stronger than that in nearby galaxies. If we assume a condensation
efficiency expected from theoretical calculations ($f_{\mathrm{in}} \la 0.1$),
strong dust growth (even stronger than assumed for nearby galaxies if they are
metal-poor galaxies) is required. These results indicate that the normal
galaxies detected by ALMA at $z>6$ are biased to objects (i) with high dust
condensation efficiency in stellar ejecta, (ii) with strong dust growth in very
dense molecular clouds, or (iii) with efficient dust growth because of fast
metal enrichment up to solar metallicity. A measurement of metallicity is
crucial to distinguish among these possibilities.

randomization and possible conversion into thermal light. Here, we show that
network topology plays a decisive role in determining the statistics of the
emerging field if the underlying lattice satisfies chiral symmetry. By
examining one-dimensional arrays of randomly coupled waveguides arranged on
linear and ring topologies, we are led to a remarkable prediction: the field
circularity and the photon statistics in ring lattices are dictated by its
parity -- whether the number of sites is even or odd, while the same quantities
are insensitive to the parity of a linear lattice. Adding or subtracting a
single lattice site can switch the photon statistics from super-thermal to
sub-thermal, or vice versa. This behavior is understood by examining the real
and imaginary fields on a chiral-symmetric lattice, which form two strands that
interleave along the lattice sites. These strands can be fully braided around
an even-sited ring lattice thereby producing super-thermal photon statistics,
while an odd-sited lattice is incommensurate with such an arrangement and the
statistics become sub-thermal. Such effects are suppressed in the limit of high
lattice disorder, whereupon Anderson localization arrests the spread of light
around the lattice and eliminates topology-dependent phenomena.

use it to obtain a conceptual representation of tweets. Unlike previous key
word based systems and topic modeling approaches, our ontological approach
allows us to apply more stringent criteria for determining which messages are
relevant such as spatial and temporal characteristics whilst giving a stronger
guarantee that the resulting models will perform well on new data that may be
lexically divergent. We achieve this by training learners on concepts rather
than individual words. For training we use a dataset containing mentions of
influenza and Listeria and use the learned models to classify datasets
containing mentions of an arbitrary selection of other diseases. We show that
our ontological approach achieves good performance on this task using a variety
of Natural Language Processing Techniques. We also show that word vectors can
be learned directly from our concepts to achieve even better results.

\frac12$ and small $\epsilon>0$, with high probability a random Euclidean
self-orthogonal code over $\F_q$ of rate $1-H_q(\delta)-\epsilon$ is $(\delta,

Euclidean self-orthogonal codes. In addition, we extend the result to list
decoding {\it symplectic dual-containing} codes by showing that the
list-decodability of random symplectic dual-containing codes achieves the

has multiple applications. Existing methods for RP and RR measurement fall into
one of the three categories - (i) estimation through nasal air flow
measurement, (ii) estimation from video-based remote photoplethysmography, and
(iii) estimation by measurement of motion induced by respiration using motion
detectors. These methods, however, require specialized sensors, are
computationally expensive and/or critically depend on selection of a region of
interest (ROI) for processing. In this paper a general framework is described
for estimating a periodic signal driving noisy LTI channels connected in
parallel with unknown dynamics. The method is then applied to derive a
computationally inexpensive method for estimating RP using 2D cameras that does
not critically depend on ROI. Specifically, RP is estimated by imaging the
changes in the reflected light caused by respiration-induced motion. Each
spatial location in the field of view of the camera is modeled as a
noise-corrupted linear time-invariant (LTI) measurement channel with unknown
system dynamics, driven by a single generating respiratory signal. Estimation
of RP is cast as a blind deconvolution problem and is solved through a method
comprising subspace projection and statistical aggregation. Experiments are
carried out on 31 healthy human subjects by generating multiple RPs and
comparing the proposed estimates with simultaneously acquired ground truth from
an impedance pneumograph device. The proposed estimator agrees well with the
ground truth device in terms of correlation measures, despite variability in
clothing pattern, angle of view and ROI.

  This familiar framework falls apart when the time derivatives do not occur

of configuration averages of these excitation energies on the supercell size
can be used for an efficient determination of the spin-wave stiffness D. The
developed formalism is applied to the ferromagnetic Mn-doped GaAs semiconductor

relation of the spin stiffness to the Curie temperature Tc has been studied for
Mn-doped GaAs and GaN semiconductors. It is found that the ratio Tc/D exhibits
qualitatively the same dependence on Mn concentration in both systems.

kinetics is taken into account by working on the fundamental solutions of
far-field linearized Navier-Stokes equations, it is proven that the furthest
far-field zone adjacent to the uniform fluid at infinity must be unsteady,
viscous and compressible, where all disturbances degenerate to sound waves that
decay exponentially. But this optimal rate does not exist in some commonly used
simplified flow models, such as steady flow, incompressible flow and inviscid
flow, because they actually work in true subspaces of the unbounded free space,
which are surrounded by further far fields of different nature. This finding
naturally leads to a zonal structure of externally-unbounded flow field. The
significance of the zonal structure is demonstrated by its close relevance to
existing theories of aerodynamic force and moment in external flows, including
the removal of the difficulties or paradoxes inherent in the simplified models.

G134.2+0.8, associated with IRAS02245+6115, is located. Interestingly, just
north and south of G134.2+0.8 we found NH3 emission exhibiting large velocity
widths of ~ 2.8 km/s, compared to 1.8 km/s at the other positions. As the
possibility of mechanical energy injection through the activity of YSO(s) is
low, we considered the origin of the large turbulent gas motion as indication
of interaction between the compact HII region and the periphery of the dense
molecular cloud. We also found expanding motion of the CO emission associated

formed by the expanding bubble of W4. However, the small velocity widths
observed west of IRAS02245+6115, around the center of the dense molecular
cloud, suggest that interaction with the compact HII region is limited.
Therefore the YSOs (dominantly Class 0/I) in the core of the AFGL333-Ridge
dense molecular cloud most likely formed in quiescent mode. As has been
previously suggested for the large scale star formation in the W3 giant
molecular cloud, our results show an apparent coexistence of induced and
quiescent star formation in this region. It appears that star formation in the
AFGL333 region has proceeded without significant external triggers, but
accompanying stellar feedback environment.

rotation (i.e., near break-up). We test this hypothesis by searching for Be
stars within two YMCs in the LMC (NGC 1850 and NGC 1856), which are thought to
be critically rotating stars with decretion disks that are (partially) ionised

first and reaches its maximum value at some critical thickness, below which the
amplitude turns to diminish. This trend is attributed to the hybridization
between surfaces of the TI film, which opens a gap below critical thickness and
thus turns the surfaces into insulating state from semi-metal state. In
insulating phase, diamagnetism induced by the gap-opening compensates
paramagnetism of Dirac state, resulting in a diminishing magnetic
susceptibility and RKKY coupling. For typical parameters, the critical
thickness in Bi2Se3 thin film is estimated to be in the range of 3-5 nm.

"1611.06713","Seth Flaxman","Charles Loeffler and Seth Flaxman","Is Gun Violence Contagious?",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Existing theories of gun violence predict stable spatial concentrations and
contagious diffusion of gun violence into surrounding areas. Recent empirical
studies have reported confirmatory evidence of such spatiotemporal diffusion of
gun violence. However, existing tests cannot readily distinguish spatiotemporal
clustering from spatiotemporal diffusion. This leaves as an open question
whether gun violence actually is contagious or merely clusters in space and
time. Compounding this problem, gun violence is subject to considerable
measurement error with many nonfatal shootings going unreported to police.
Using point process data from an acoustical gunshot locator system and a
combination of Bayesian spatiotemporal point process modeling and space/time
interaction tests, this paper demonstrates that contemporary urban gun violence
does diffuse, but only slightly, suggesting that a disease model for infectious
spread of gun violence is a poor fit for the geographically stable and
temporally stochastic process observed.

at lower pressures a `pentagonal ice' phase (not yet observed experimentally)
has the lowest enthalpy, and at ambient pressure the `pentagonal ice' phase is
degenerate with a `hexagonal ice' phase. Our DMC results also allow us to
evaluate the accuracy of various density functional theory exchange correlation

color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). Moreover, these young clusters host an
extended main sequence turn off (eMSTO) in close analogy with what is observed
in most ~1-2 Gyr old clusters of both Magellanic Clouds.
  We use high-precision Hubble-Space-Telescope photometry to study the young
star cluster NGC1866 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We discover an eMSTO and a
split MS. The analysis of the CMD reveals that (i) the blue MS is the less
populous one, hosting about one-third of the total number of MS stars; (ii)
red-MS stars are more centrally concentrated than blue-MS stars; (iii) the
fraction of blue-MS stars with respect to the total number of MS stars drops by
a factor of ~2 in the upper MS with F814W <~19.7.
  The comparison between the observed CMDs and stellar models reveals that the
observations are consistent with ~200 Myr old highly-rotating stars on the
red-MS, with rotation close to critical value, plus a non-rotating stellar
population spanning an age interval between ~140 and 220 Myr, on the blue-MS.
Noticeable, neither stellar populations with different ages only, nor coeval
stellar models with different rotation rates, properly reproduce the observed
split MS and eMSTO. We discuss these results in the context of the eMSTO and

hidden information of a victim profile and retrieve private information from
public one. OSSINT retrieves the friendship network of a victim and shows how
it is possible to infer additional private information (e.g., user personal
preferences and hobbies). Our proposed system OSSINT goes extra mile about the
network topology information, i.e., predicting new friendships using the
victim's friends of friends network (2-hop of distance from the victim
profile), and hence possibly deduce private information of the full Facebook
network. OSSINT correctly improved the previous results of SocialSpy predicting
an average of 11 additional friendships with peaks of 20 new friends. Moreover,
OSSINT, for the considered victim profiles demonstrated how it is possible to
infer real life information such as current city, hometown, university,

describe a cross-Kerr nonlinearity interaction between two resonators when the

require classical pulses. Furthermore, due to use of only a three-level qutrit,
the experimental setup is much simplified when compared with previous proposals
requiring a four-level artificial atomic systems. Based on our Hamiltonian, we
implement a two-resonator qubits controlled-phase gate and generate a
two-resonator entangled coherent state. Numerical simulation shows that the
high-fidelity implementation of the phase gate and creation of the entangled

computationally convenient nonlinear shrinkage estimator for the integrated
covariance (ICV) matrix of financial assets is developed in two steps. The
eigenvectors of the ICV are first constructed from a designed time variation
adjusted realized covariance matrix of noise-free log-returns of relatively low
frequency data. Then the regularized eigenvalues of the ICV are estimated by
quasi-maximum likelihood based on high frequency data. The estimator is always
positive definite and its inverse is the estimator of the inverse of ICV. It
minimizes the limit of the out-of-sample variance of portfolio returns within
the class of rotation-equivalent estimators. It works when the number of
underlying assets is larger than the number of time series observations in each

theoretical results are derived under the assumption that the number of assets

theory associated with pion condensation, we introduce the pionic source as an
infrared regulator. We discuss various methods to extrapolate the results to
vanishing pionic source, including a novel method based on the singular value
spectrum of the massive Dirac operator, a leading-order reweighting and a
spline Monte-Carlo fit. Our main results concern the phase transition boundary
between the normal and the pion condensation phases and the
chiral/deconfinement transition temperature as a function of the chemical
potential. In addition, we perform a quantitative comparison between our direct
results and a Taylor-expansion obtained at zero chemical potential to assess
the applicability range of the latter.

Cell Transmission Model. Assuming perfect model knowledge and perfect traffic
demand prediction, the ramp metering problem can be cast as a finite horizon
optimal control problem with the objective of minimizing the Total Time Spent,
i.e., the sum of the travel times of all drivers. For this reason, the
application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) to the ramp metering problem has
been proposed. However, practical tests on freeways show that MPC may not
outperform simple, distributed feedback policies. Until now, a theoretical
justification for this empirical observation was lacking. This work compares
the performance of distributed, non-predictive policies to the optimal solution
in an idealised setting, specifically, for monotonic traffic dynamics and
assuming perfect model knowledge. To do so, we suggest a distributed,
non-predictive policy and derive sufficient optimality conditions for the
minimization of the Total Time Spent via monotonicity arguments. In a case
study based on real-world traffic data, we demonstrate that these optimality
conditions are only rarely violated. Moreover, we observe that the
suboptimality resulting from such infrequent violations appears to be
negligible. We complement this analysis with simulations in non-ideal settings,
in particular allowing for model mismatch, and argue that Alinea, a successful,
distributed ramp metering policy, comes close to the ideal controller both in
terms of control behavior and in performance.

associated with large-scale currents in the ionosphere at polar latitudes that
flow along magnetic field lines (Birkeland currents) and horizontally. These
current systems are tightly linked, but their global behaviors are rarely
analyzed together. In this paper, we present estimates of the average global
Birkeland currents and horizontal ionospheric currents from the same set of
magnetic field measurements. The magnetic field measurements, from the low
Earth orbiting $\textit{Swarm}$ and CHAMP satellites, are used to co-estimate
poloidal and toroidal parts of the magnetic disturbance field, represented in
magnetic apex coordinates. The use of apex coordinates reduces effects of
longitudinal and hemispheric variations in the Earth's main field. We present
global currents from both hemispheres during different sunlight conditions. The
results show that the Birkeland currents vary with the conductivity, which
depends most strongly on solar EUV emissions on the dayside and on particle
precipitation at pre-midnight magnetic local times. In sunlight, the horizontal
equivalent current flows in two cells, resembling an opposite ionospheric
convection pattern, which implies that it is dominated by Hall currents. By
combining the Birkeland current maps and the equivalent current, we are able to
calculate the total horizontal current, without any assumptions about the
conductivity. We show that the total horizontal current is close to zero in the
polar cap when it is dark. That implies that the equivalent current, which is
sensed by ground magnetometers, is largely canceled by the horizontal closure
of the Birkeland currents.

homodyning techniques and photon correlation measurements. These methods
require a well-defined carrier frequency and photons contained in a quantum
state need to be absorbed or amplified. They currently function in the visible
to near-infrared and microwave spectral ranges. Quantum nondemolition
experiments may be performed at the expense of excess fluctuations in another
quadrature. Here we generate mid-infrared time-locked patterns of squeezed
vacuum noise. After propagation through free space, the quantum fluctuations of
the electric field are studied in the time domain by electro-optic sampling
with few-femtosecond laser pulses. We directly compare the local noise
amplitude to the level of bare vacuum fluctuations. This nonlinear approach
operates off resonance without absorption or amplification of the field that is

  Local Density Peaks Searching","16 pages, 9 figures, journal paper",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The $k$-means clustering algorithm is popular but has the following main
drawbacks: 1) the number of clusters, $k$, needs to be provided by the user in
advance, 2) it can easily reach local minima with randomly selected initial
centers, 3) it is sensitive to outliers, and 4) it can only deal with well
separated hyperspherical clusters. In this paper, we propose a Local Density
Peaks Searching (LDPS) initialization framework to address these issues. The
LDPS framework includes two basic components: one of them is the local density
that characterizes the density distribution of a data set, and the other is the
local distinctiveness index (LDI) which we introduce to characterize how
distinctive a data point is compared with its neighbors. Based on these two
components, we search for the local density peaks which are characterized with
high local densities and high LDIs to deal with 1) and 2). Moreover, we detect
outliers characterized with low local densities but high LDIs, and exclude them
out before clustering begins. Finally, we apply the LDPS initialization
framework to $k$-medoids, which is a variant of $k$-means and chooses data
samples as centers, with diverse similarity measures other than the Euclidean
distance to fix the last drawback of $k$-means. Combining the LDPS
initialization framework with $k$-means and $k$-medoids, we obtain two novel
clustering methods called LDPS-means and LDPS-medoids, respectively.
Experiments on synthetic data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed
methods, especially when the ground truth of the cluster number $k$ is large.
Further, experiments on several real world data sets, Handwritten Pendigits,
Coil-20, Coil-100 and Olivetti Face Database, illustrate that our methods give
a superior performance than the analogous approaches on both estimating $k$ and
unsupervised object categorization.

shall describe the Fukushima's decompositions of $(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{F})$

martingale part is a standard Brownian motion and what we can say about their
zero energy part. Finally, when we put these two kinds of discussions together,
an interesting class of stochastic differential equations are raised. They have
uncountable solutions that do not depend on the initial condition.

not violate causality. Depending on the exact space-time coordinates of the
measurement events in a multi-party Bell experiment, causality only imposes a
subset of the usual no-signaling conditions. After revisiting the derivation of
the two-party no-signaling constraints, we consider the three-party Bell

no-signaling conditions is sufficient to preserve causality. Secondly, we
examine the implications for device-independent cryptography against an
eavesdropper constrained only by the laws of relativity. We show an explicit
attack in certain measurement configurations on a family of protocols based on
the n-party Mermin inequalities that were previously proven secure under the
old no-signaling conditions. We then show that security of two-party protocols
can also be compromised when the eavesdropper's measurement configuration is
not constrained. The monogamy of non-local correlations that underpin their use
in secrecy can also be broken in certain space-time configurations. Thirdly, we
inspect the notion of free-choice and propose a definition of free-choice in
the multi-party Bell experiment. We then re-examine the question whether
quantum correlations may admit explanations by finite speed superluminal

and have to determine whether there is a set $X\subseteq V$ of size at most $k$
such that each edge in $E$ has at least one endpoint in $X$. The problem can be
easily solved in time $O^*(2^k)$, making it fixed-parameter tractable (FPT)
with respect to $k$. While the fastest known algorithm takes only time
$O^*(1.2738^k)$, much stronger improvements have been obtained by studying
parameters that are smaller than $k$. Apart from treewidth-related results, the
arguably best algorithm for Vertex Cover runs in time $O^*(2.3146^p)$, where
$p=k-LP(G)$ is only the excess of the solution size $k$ over the best
fractional vertex cover (Lokshtanov et al.\ TALG 2014). Since $p\leq k$ but $k$
cannot be bounded in terms of $p$ alone, this strictly increases the range of
tractable instances.
  Recently, Garg and Philip (SODA 2016) greatly contributed to understanding
the parameterized complexity of the Vertex Cover problem. They prove that
$2LP(G)-MM(G)$ is a lower bound for the vertex cover size of $G$, where $MM(G)$
is the size of a largest matching of $G$, and proceed to study parameter
$\ell=k-(2LP(G)-MM(G))$. They give an algorithm of running time $O^*(3^\ell)$,
proving that Vertex Cover is FPT in $\ell$. It can be easily observed that
$\ell\leq p$ whereas $p$ cannot be bounded in terms of $\ell$ alone. We
complement the work of Garg and Philip by proving that Vertex Cover admits a
randomized polynomial kernelization in terms of $\ell$, i.e., an efficient
preprocessing to size polynomial in $\ell$. This improves over parameter
$p=k-LP(G)$ for which this was previously known (Kratsch and Wahlstr\""om FOCS

gives a hint to solving the dark matter problem based on similar ways discussed
recently in many radiative neutrino mass models with dark matter. Except the
active neutrinos, the appearance of singly charged Higgs bosons and dark matter
does not affect significantly the physical spectrum of all particles in the

sector are also presented. All couplings of the SM-like Higgs boson to normal
fermions and gauge bosons are different from the SM predictions by a factor
$c_h$, which must satisfy the recent global fit of experimental data, namely
$0.995<|c_h|<1$. We have analyzed a more general diagonalization of gauge boson
mass matrices, then we show that the ratio of the tangents of the $W-W'$ and
$Z-Z'$ mixing angles is exactly the cosine of the Weinberg angle, implying that
number of parameters is reduced by 1. Signals of new physics from decays of new
heavy fermions and Higgs bosons at LHC and constraints of their masses are also
discussed.

Inelastic Scattering experimental results. It enables us to improve the
description of the data by means of a new determination of the parton

description of several structure functions, involving unpolarized parton
distributions and helicity distributions, in a broad range of $x$ and $Q^2$ and
in terms of a rather small number of free parameters. There are several
challenging issues, in particular the behavior of $\bar d(x) / \bar u(x)$ at
large $x$, a possible large positive gluon helicity distribution, etc.. The
predictions of this theoretical approach will be tested for single-jet

(RQFT) some results depend on regularization scheme at ultraviolet. In the
chiral superfluid 3He-A, which contains two Weyl points and also experiences
the effects of chiral anomaly, the ""trans-Planckian"" physics is known and the
results can be obtained without regularization. We discuss this on example of
the chiral magnetic effect (CME), which has been observed in 3He-A in 90's.
There are two forms of the contribution of the CME to the Chern-Simons term in
free energy, perturbative and non-perturbative. The perturbative term comes
from the fermions living in the vicinity of the Weyl point, where the fermions
are ""relativistic"" and obey the Weyl equation. The non-perturbative term
originates from the deep vacuum, being determined by the separation of the two
Weyl points. Both terms are obtained using the Adler-Bell-Jackiw equation for
chiral anomaly, and both agree with the results of the microscopic calculations
in the ""trans-Planckian"" region. Existence of the two nonequivalent forms of
the Chern-Simons term demonstrates that the results obtained within the RQFT
depend on the specific properties of the underlying quantum vacuum and may
reflect different physical phenomena in the same vacuum.

surrounding soft photon fields is a long-standing problem of jet physics. In
some cases the most likely emission site close to the central black hole is
ruled out because of the high opacity caused by strong optical and infrared
photon sources, such as the broad line region. Mostly neglected for jet
modeling is the absorption of $\gamma$-rays in the starlight photon field of
the host galaxy. Analyzing the absorption for arbitrary locations and
observation angles of the $\gamma$-ray emission site within the host galaxy we
find that the distance to the galaxy center, the observation angle, and the
distribution of starlight in the galaxy are crucial for the amount of
absorption. We derive the absorption value for a sample of $20$ TeV detected
blazars with a redshift $z_r<0.2$. The absorption value of the $\gamma$-ray
emission located in the galaxy center may be as high as $20\%$ with an average
value of $6\%$. This is important in order to determine the intrinsic blazar
parameters. We see no significant trends in our sample between the degree of
absorption and host properties, such as starlight emissivity, galactic size,
half-light radius, and redshift. While the uncertainty of the spectral
properties of the extragalactic background light exceeds the effect of
absorption by stellar light from the host galaxy in distant objects, the latter
is a dominant effect in nearby sources. It may also be revealed in a
differential comparison of sources with similar redshifts.

visually associated with a low-mass red-supergiant progenitor. To model SN
2008bk, we evolve a 12Msun star from the main sequence until core collapse,
when it has a total mass of 9.88Msun, a He-core mass of 3.22Msun, and a radius
of 502Rsun. We then artificially trigger an explosion that produces 8.29Msun of
ejecta with a total energy of 2.5x10^50erg and ~0.009Msun of 56Ni. We model the
subsequent evolution of the ejecta with non-Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium
time-dependent radiative transfer. Although somewhat too luminous and
energetic, this model reproduces satisfactorily the multi-band light curves and
multi-epoch spectra of SN 2008bk, confirming the suitability of a low-mass
massive star progenitor. As in other low-luminosity SNe II, the structured
Halpha profile at the end of the plateau phase is probably caused by BaII
6496.9A rather than asphericity. We discuss the sensitivity of our results to
changes in progenitor radius and mass, as well as chemical mixing. A 15%
increase in progenitor radius causes a 15% increase in luminosity and a 0.2mag
V-band brightening of the plateau but leaves its length unaffected. An increase
in ejecta mass by 10% lengthens the plateau by ~10d. Chemical mixing introduces
slight changes to the bolometric light curve, limited to the end of the
plateau, but has a large impact on colours and spectra at nebular times.

directions of cosmic rays detected at the Pierre Auger Observatory with local
zenith angles up to $80^\circ$ and energies in excess of 4 EeV ($4 \times
10^{18}$ eV). This search is conducted by measuring the angular power spectrum
and performing a needlet wavelet analysis in two independent energy ranges.
Both analyses are complementary since the angular power spectrum achieves a
better performance in identifying large-scale patterns while the needlet
wavelet analysis, considering the parameters used in this work, presents a
higher efficiency in detecting smaller-scale anisotropies, potentially
providing directional information on any observed anisotropies. No deviation
from isotropy is observed on any angular scale in the energy range between 4
and 8 EeV. Above 8 EeV, an indication for a dipole moment is captured; while no
other deviation from isotropy is observed for moments beyond the dipole one.
The corresponding $p$-values obtained after accounting for searches blindly
performed at several angular scales, are $1.3 \times 10^{-5}$ in the case of
the angular power spectrum, and $2.5 \times 10^{-3}$ in the case of the needlet
analysis. While these results are consistent with previous reports making use
of the same data set, they provide extensions of the previous works through the
thorough scans of the angular scales.

first search for magnetic monopole production in 13 TeV proton-proton

Magnetic charges exceeding half the Dirac charge are excluded in all samples
and limits are placed for the first time on the production of magnetic
monopoles in 13 TeV $pp$ collisions. The search probes mass ranges previously
inaccessible to collider experiments for up to five times the Dirac charge.

that is under active study in the field of cancer biology. Its rapid
progression and the relative time cost of obtaining molecular data make other
readily-available forms of data, such as images, an important resource for
actionable measures in patients. Our goal is to utilize information given by
medical images taken from GBM patients in statistical settings. To do this, we
design a novel statistic---the smooth Euler characteristic transform
(SECT)---that quantifies magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of tumors. Due to its
well-defined inner product structure, the SECT can be used in a wider range of
functional and nonparametric modeling approaches than other previously proposed
topological summary statistics. When applied to a cohort of GBM patients, we
find that the SECT is a better predictor of clinical outcomes than both
existing tumor shape quantifications and common molecular assays. Specifically,
we demonstrate that SECT features alone explain more of the variance in GBM
patient survival than gene expression, volumetric features, and morphometric
features. The main takeaways from our findings are thus twofold. First, they
suggest that images contain valuable information that can play an important
role in clinical prognosis and other medical decisions. Second, they show that
the SECT is a viable tool for the broader study of medical imaging informatics.

trivially necessary divisibility conditions are sufficient to guarantee a
decomposition of any sufficiently large complete $r$-uniform hypergraph into
edge-disjoint copies of~$F$, which answers a question asked e.g.~by Keevash.
The graph case $r=2$ was proved by Wilson in 1975 and forms one of the
cornerstones of design theory. The case when~$F$ is complete corresponds to the
existence of block designs, a problem going back to the 19th century, which was
recently settled by Keevash. In particular, our argument provides a new proof
of the existence of block designs, based on iterative absorption (which employs
purely probabilistic and combinatorial methods).
  Our main result concerns decompositions of hypergraphs whose clique
distribution fulfills certain regularity constraints. Our argument allows us to
employ a `regularity boosting' process which frequently enables us to satisfy
these constraints even if the clique distribution of the original hypergraph
does not satisfy them. This enables us to go significantly beyond the setting
of quasirandom hypergraphs considered by Keevash. In particular, we obtain a

to the reduced system an explicit subgrid term enabling to take into account

ripples are parallel to the $[1\bar{1}0]$ direction without any external
anisotropy. The origin of this self-alignment was not fully understood until
now. A simple experiment exposing the front side and back side of a GaAs$(001)$
wafer to the ion beam clarifies its origin and proves that the ripples align to
the Ga dimer rows. As the direction of Ga dimer rows rotates by 90{\deg} on the
back side, the orientation of the ripples also rotates by 90{\deg} to $[110]$.
We discuss the experimental results in view of a model where the pattern
formation is driven by creation of vacancies and ad-atoms by the ion beam and
their diffusion, which is linked to the direction of dimers on the surface.

traditional oxide functionalities with the dissipationless surface states of

contradiction between TI-ness and stability which is maximal for oxides, and
trace the basic design principles necessary to identify the window of

achieve topological band inversion (""topological gene"") in ABO3 as being a
lone-pair electron-rich B atom (e.g. Te, I, Bi) at the octahedral site. We then
illustrate that poorly screened oxide systems with large inversion energies can
undergo energy-lowering atomic distortions that remove the band inversion. We
identify the coexistence windows of TI functionality and structure stability
for different pressures and find that the common cubic ABO3 structures have
inversion energies lying outside this coexistence window at zero pressure but
could be moved into the coexistence window at moderate pressures. Our study
demonstrates the interplay between topological band inversion and structural

Using a recent classification of generalized linear models for categorical
data, we discussed about a conceptual selection of these models for the
longitudinal analysis of HRQoL in cancer clinical trials. Through
methodological and practical arguments, the adjacent and cumulative models seem
particularly suitable for this {context}. Specially in cancer clinical trials
and for the comparison between two groups, the cumulative models has the
advantage of providing intuitive illustrations of results. To complete the
comparison studies already performed in literature, a simulation study based on
random part of the mixed models is then carried out to compare the linear mixed
model classically used to the discussed item response models. As expected, the
sensitivity of item response models to detect random effect with lower variance
is better than the linear mixed model sensitivity. Finally, a longitudinal
analysis of HRQoL data from cancer clinical trial is carried out using an item
response cumulative model.

this may be due to the system dynamics (mass and tangential stiffness) of the
pin or other system components being neglected. This paper builds on the
results of a previous study (Popov M. et al. Friction, 2016, submitted) by
taking the stiffness and resulting dynamics of the system into account. The
main governing parameters determining macroscopic friction, including a
dimensionless oscillation amplitude, a dimensionless sliding velocity and the
relation between three characteristic frequencies (that of externally excited
oscillation and two natural oscillation frequencies associated with the contact
stiffness and the system stiffness) are identified. In the limiting cases of a
very soft system and a very stiff system, our results reproduce the results of
previous studies. In between these two limiting cases there is also a resonant
case, which is studied here for the first time. The resonant case is notable in
that it lacks a critical sliding velocity, above which oscillations no longer
reduce friction. Results obtained for the resonant case are qualitatively
supported by experiments.

distances between metric spaces. It is defined as the minimal distortion of
embedding one surface into the other, while the optimal correspondence can be
described as the map that minimizes this distortion. Solving such a
minimization is a hard combinatorial problem that requires pre-computation and
storing of all pairwise geodesic distances for the matched surfaces. A popular
way for compact representation of functions on surfaces is by projecting them
into the leading eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO). When
truncated, The basis of the LBO is known to be the optimal for representing
functions with bounded gradient in a min-max sense. Methods such as
Spectral-GMDS exploit this idea to simplify and efficiently approximate a
minimization related to the GH distance by operating in the truncated spectral
domain, and obtain state of the art results for matching of nearly isometric
shapes. However, when considering only a specific set of functions on the
surface, such as geodesic distances, an optimized basis could be considered as
an even better alternative. Here, we define the geodesic distance basis, which
is optimal for compact approximation of geodesic distances, in terms of
Frobenius norm. We use the suggested basis to extract the Geodesic Distance
Descriptor (GDD), which encodes the geodesic distances information as a linear
combination of the basis functions. We then show how these ideas can be used to
efficiently and accurately approximate the metric spaces matching problem with
almost no loss of information. These observations are used to construct a very

in white dwarf (WD) stars and improvement of the Xe abundance determinations.
  We calculated Zr IV-VII, Xe IV-V, and Xe VIII oscillator strengths to
consider radiative and collisional bound-bound transitions of Zr and Xe in our
NLTE stellar-atmosphere models for the analysis of their lines exhibited in UV
observations of the hot WDs G191-B2B and RE0503-289.
  We identified one new Zr IV, 14 new Zr V, and ten new Zr VI lines in the
spectrum of RE0503-289. Zr was detected for the first time in a WD. We measured
a Zr abundance of -3.5 +/- 0.2 (logarithmic mass fraction, approx. 11 500 times
solar). We dentified five new Xe VI lines and determined a Xe abundance of -3.9
+/- 0.2 (approx. 7500 times solar). We determined a preliminary photospheric Al
abundance of -4.3 +/- 0.2 (solar) in RE0503-289. In the spectra of G191-B2B, no
Zr line was identified. The strongest Zr IV line (1598.948 A) in our model gave
an upper limit of -5.6 +/- 0.3 which is about 100 times solar. No Xe line was
identified in the UV spectrum of G191-B2B and we confirmed the previously
determined upper limit of -6.8 +/- 0.3 (ten times solar).
  Precise measurements and calculations of atomic data are a prerequisite for
advanced NLTE stellar-atmosphere modeling. Observed Zr IV - VI and Xe VI - VII
line profiles in the UV spectrum of RE0503-289 were simultaneously well
reproduced.

absorptive corrections, which have been under debate for a long time. On
nuclear targets these corrections are significantly enhanced and push the
partial cross sections of neutron production to the very periphery of the
nucleus. As a result, the A-dependences of inclusive and diffractive neutron
production turn out to be similar. The mechanism of \pi-a_1 interference, which
successfully explained the observed single-spin asymmetry of neutrons in
polarized pp interactions, is extended here to polarized pA collisions.
Corrected for nuclear effects it explains well the magnitude and sign of the
asymmetry A_N observed in inelastic events, resulting in a violent break up of
the nucleus. However the excessive magnitude of A_N observed in the diffractive

standards. Network densification offers more capacity by shrinking base
stations' (BSs) footprints, thus reduces the number of users served by each BS.
However, the gains in the capacity are achieved at the expense of increased
handover (HO) rates. Hence, HO rate is a key performance limiting factor that
should be carefully considered in densification planning. This paper sheds
light on the HO problem that appears in dense 5G networks and proposes an
effective solution via topology aware HO skipping. Different skipping
techniques are considered and compared with the conventional best connected
scheme. To this end, the effectiveness of the proposed schemes is validated by
studying the average user rate in the downlink single-tier and two-tier
cellular networks, which are modeled using Poisson point process and Poisson
cluster process, respectively. The proposed skipping schemes show up to 47%
gains in the average throughput that would maximize the benefit of network
densification.

  in Complex Systems","submitted to: New Journal of Physics",,"10.1088/1367-2630/aa7b61",,"nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When quantifying the time spent in the transient of a complex dynamical
system, the fundamental problem is that for a large class of systems the actual
time for reaching an attractor is infinite. Common methods for dealing with
this problem usually introduce three additional problems: non-invariance,
physical interpretation, and discontinuities, calling for carefully designed
methods for quantifying transients.
  In this article, we discuss how the aforementioned problems emerge and
propose two novel metrics, Regularized Reaching Time ($T_{RR}$) and Area under
Distance Curve (AUDIC), to solve them, capturing two complementary aspects of
the transient dynamics.
  $T_{RR}$ quantifies the additional time (positive or negative) that a
trajectory starting at a chosen initial condition needs to reach the attractor
after a reference trajectory has already arrived there. A positive or negative
value means that it arrives by this much earlier or later than the reference.
Because $T_{RR}$ is an analysis of return times after shocks, it is a
systematic approach to the concept of critical slowing down [1]; hence it is
naturally an early-warning signal [2] for bifurcations when central statistics
over distributions of initial conditions are used.
  AUDIC is the distance of the trajectory to the attractor integrated over
time. Complementary to $T_{RR}$, it measures which trajectories are reluctant,
i.e. stay away from the attractor for long, or eager to approach it right away.
  (... shortened for arxiv listing, full abstract in paper ...) New features in
these models can be uncovered, including the surprising regularity of the
Roessler system's basin of attraction even in the regime of a chaotic
attractor. Additionally, we demonstrate the critical slowing down
interpretation by presenting the metrics' sensitivity to prebifurcational
change and thus how they act as early-warning signals.

and associated magnetic field disturbances are highly organized by Earth's main
magnetic field. This is due to the fact that the charged particles that
comprise space plasma can move almost freely along magnetic field lines, but
not across them. For this reason it is sensible to present such phenomena
relative to Earth's magnetic field. A large variety of magnetic coordinate
systems exist, designed for different purposes and regions, ranging from the
magnetopause to the ionosphere. In this paper we review the most common
magnetic coordinate systems and describe how they are defined, where they are
used, and how to convert between them. The definitions are presented based on
the spherical harmonic expansion coefficients of the International Geomagnetic
Reference Field (IGRF) and, in some of the coordinate systems, the position of
the Sun which we show how to calculate from the time and date. The most
detailed coordinate systems take the full IGRF into account and define magnetic
latitude and longitude such that they are constant along field lines. These
coordinate systems, which are useful at ionospheric altitudes, are
non-orthogonal. We show how to handle vectors and vector calculus in such
coordinates, and discuss how systematic errors may appear if this is not done
correctly.
