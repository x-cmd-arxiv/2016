  Collaborative-representation-based Classification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper presents a dictionary integration algorithm using 3D morphable face
models (3DMM) for pose-invariant collaborative-representation-based face
classification. To this end, we first fit a 3DMM to the 2D face images of a
dictionary to reconstruct the 3D shape and texture of each image. The 3D faces
are used to render a number of virtual 2D face images with arbitrary pose
variations to augment the training data, by merging the original and rendered
virtual samples to create an extended dictionary. Second, to reduce the
information redundancy of the extended dictionary and improve the sparsity of
reconstruction coefficient vectors using collaborative-representation-based
classification (CRC), we exploit an on-line elimination scheme to optimise the
extended dictionary by identifying the most representative training samples for
a given query. The final goal is to perform pose-invariant face classification
using the proposed dictionary integration method and the on-line pruning
strategy under the CRC framework. Experimental results obtained for a set of
well-known face datasets demonstrate the merits of the proposed method,
especially its robustness to pose variations.

steadily gained popularity due to improved bandwidth, ease of generating

to traditional cable television, revenue in online services is generated solely
through advertisements, and depends on the number of clicks generated. Channel
owners aim to opportunistically schedule advertisements so as to generate
maximum revenue. This paper considers the problem of optimal scheduling of
advertisements in live online social media. The problem is formulated as a
multiple stopping problem and is addressed in a partially observed Markov
decision process (POMDP) framework. Structural results are provided on the
optimal advertisement scheduling policy. By exploiting the structure of the
optimal policy, best linear thresholds are computed using stochastic
approximation. The proposed model and framework are validated on real datasets,
and the following observations are made: (i) The policy obtained by the
multiple stopping problem can be used to detect changes in ground truth from
online search data (ii) Numerical results show a significant improvement in the
expected revenue by opportunistically scheduling the advertisements. The
revenue can be improved by $20-30\%$ in comparison to currently employed
periodic scheduling.

equation for several interacting populations at the mesoscopic scale starting
from a microscopic model of randomly connected generalized integrate-and-fire
neuron models. Each population consists of 50 -- 2000 neurons of the same type
but different populations account for different neuron types. The stochastic
population equations that we find reveal how spike-history effects in
single-neuron dynamics such as refractoriness and adaptation interact with
finite-size fluctuations on the population level. Efficient integration of the
stochastic mesoscopic equations reproduces the statistical behavior of the
population activities obtained from microscopic simulations of a full spiking
neural network model. The theory describes nonlinear emergent dynamics like
finite-size-induced stochastic transitions in multistable networks and
synchronization in balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The
mesoscopic equations are employed to rapidly simulate a model of a local
cortical microcircuit consisting of eight neuron types. Our theory establishes
a general framework for modeling finite-size neural population dynamics based

measure the concentration in terms of deviation from the maximum generalized
entropy value, or in terms of the distance from the maximum generalized entropy

various parameters, including a tolerance on the constraints which ensures that
they are always satisfied by an integral vector. Generalized entropy

principally based on the direct summation technique involving all accurate
experimental energy levels known for H$_2$$^{16}$O (almost 20~000 rovibrational
energies including an almost complete list up to a relative energy of 7500
\cm), augmented with a less accurate but complete list of first-principles
computed rovibrational energy levels up to the first dissociation limit, about
41~000 \cm\ (the latter list includes close to one million bound rovibrational
energy levels up to $J = 69$, where $J$ is the rotational quantum number).
Partition functions are developed for {\it ortho}- and {\it para}-H$_2$$^{16}$O
as well as for their equilibrium mixture. Unbound rovibrational states above
the first dissociation limit are considered using an approximate model
treatment. The effect of the excited electronic states on the thermochemical
functions is neglected, as their contribution to the thermochemical functions
is negligible even at the highest temperatures considered. Based on the
high-accuracy $Q_{\rm int}$($T$) and its first two moments, definitive results,
in 1~K increments, are obtained for the following thermochemical functions:
Gibbs energy, standardized enthalpy, entropy, and isobaric heat capacity.
Reliable approximately two standard deviation uncertainties, as a function of

emphasize that the present results are the most accurate ideal-gas

X-ray and Auger electron emissions. The total decay energy is measured in a

Lusignoli for a rough estimate of this shake-off process for ""s"" wave electrons

atomic wave functions of Dy* including a description of the continuum
electrons. In the present approach the wave functions of Ho and Dy* are
determined selfconsistently with the antisymmetrized relativistic
Dirac-Hartree-Fock approach. The relativistic continuum electron wave functions
for the ionized Dy* are obtained in the corresponding selfconsistent

seen after electron capture in 163Ho and thus can probably not affect the

Markov chain Monte Carlo. It posits a family of approximating distributions $q$
and finds the closest member to the exact posterior $p$. Closeness is usually
measured via a divergence $D(q || p)$ from $q$ to $p$. While successful, this
approach also has problems. Notably, it typically leads to underestimation of
the posterior variance. In this paper we propose CHIVI, a black-box variational
inference algorithm that minimizes $D_{\chi}(p || q)$, the $\chi$-divergence
from $p$ to $q$. CHIVI minimizes an upper bound of the model evidence, which we
term the $\chi$ upper bound (CUBO). Minimizing the CUBO leads to improved
posterior uncertainty, and it can also be used with the classical VI lower
bound (ELBO) to provide a sandwich estimate of the model evidence. We study
CHIVI on three models: probit regression, Gaussian process classification, and
a Cox process model of basketball plays. When compared to expectation

We describe a general hierarchical bottom-up fitting methodology to design and

simulations, we obtain results broadly consistent with previously published
fits, but improving in overall accuracy and particularly in the approach to
extremal limits and for unequal-spin configurations. We also discuss the
importance of data quality studies when combining simulations from diverse
sources, how detailed error budgets will be necessary for further improvements
of these already highly accurate fits, and how this first detailed study of
unequal-spin effects helps in choosing the most informative parameters for

satellite. It exhibits dipole (l = 1) and quadrupole (l = 2) gravity modes with
a clear period spacing structure. The seismic properties of the KIC 10553698A
provide a test of stellar evolution models, and offer a unique opportunity to
determine mixing processes. We consider mixing due to convective overshooting
beyond the boundary of the helium burning core. Very small overshooting ( f =
10^{-6} ) results in a progressive increase in the size of convective core.
However, moderate ( f = 10^{-2} ) and small ( f = 10^{-5} ) overshooting both
lead to the occurrence of inert outer convective shells in the near-core
region. We illustrate that the chemical stratifications induced by convective
shells are able to change the g-mode period spacing pattern of a sdB star
appreciably. The mean period spacing and trapping of the gravity modes in the
model with moderate and small core overshooting are fully consistent with the
period spacing trends observed in KIC 10553698A. Atomic diffusion driven by
gravitational settling as well as thermal and chemical gradients is applied to
reach a better match with the observed period spacings. Models that include
small or very small overshooting with atomic diffusion have a decreased
lifetime of the extreme horizontal branch phase and produce chemical
stratification induced by convective shells during helium burning phase. In
addition of being consistent with asteroseismology, their calculated values of
the R2 parameter are more compatible with the observed R2 values.

is based on state reduction of a monolithic supervisor with respect to each set

from the reduced supervisor to each local controller is an important criterion.
In this paper, we deal with event reduction. It is proved that the number of
events in each local controller is less than the event cardinality in the
reduced supervisor, provided that each local controller has less number of
states comparing to the reduced supervisor. It shows that each local controller
needs less number of events to make consistent decisions. Having this property,
we can evaluate the localizability of a supervisor by event reduction criteria
instead of state reduction criteria. State reduction facilitates the
implementation of local controllers on industrial systems. Whereas, event
reduction reduces communication traffic between each pair of local controllers.

motivating methods which ensure that privacy is protected. We introduce a
general privacy-preserving framework for Variational Bayes (VB), a widely used
optimization-based Bayesian inference method. Our framework respects
differential privacy, the gold-standard privacy criterion, and encompasses a
large class of probabilistic models, called the Conjugate Exponential (CE)
family. We observe that we can straightforwardly privatise VB's approximate
posterior distributions for models in the CE family, by perturbing the expected
sufficient statistics of the complete-data likelihood. For a broadly-used class
of non-CE models, those with binomial likelihoods, we show how to bring such
models into the CE family, such that inferences in the modified model resemble
the private variational Bayes algorithm as closely as possible, using the
Polya-Gamma data augmentation scheme. The iterative nature of variational Bayes
presents a further challenge since iterations increase the amount of noise
needed. We overcome this by combining: (1) an improved composition method for
differential privacy, called the moments accountant, which provides a tight
bound on the privacy cost of multiple VB iterations and thus significantly
decreases the amount of additive noise; and (2) the privacy amplification
effect of subsampling mini-batches from large-scale data in stochastic
learning. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in CE and
non-CE models including latent Dirichlet allocation, Bayesian logistic
regression, and sigmoid belief networks, evaluated on real-world datasets.

disk and propagate through the ISCO providing a Reynolds stress which causes
efficient accretion by purely hydrodynamic means and producing a radiative
signature brighter in hard X-rays than the Novikov-Thorne model. Disk cooling
is provided by a local blackbody prescription that allows the disk to evolve
self-consistently to a temperature profile where hydrodynamic heating is
balanced by radiative cooling. We find that the spiral shock structure is in
agreement with the relativistic dispersion relation for tightly-wound linear
waves. We measure the shock induced dissipation and find outward angular
momentum transport corresponding to an effective alpha parameter of order 0.01.

only one star was detected at 13cm. The detected B-type stars are significantly
more radio luminous than the non-detected ones, which is not the case for
O-type stars. The non-detections at 13cm are interpreted as due to thermal
free-free absorption. Mass-loss rates were estimated using 3cm flux densities
and were compared with theoretical mass-loss rates, which assume free-free
emission. For HD 37742, the two values of the mass-loss rates were in good
agreement, possibly suggesting that the radio emission for this star is mainly
thermal. For the other three stars, the estimated mass-loss rates from radio
observations were much higher than those expected from theory, suggesting
either a possible contribution from non- thermal emission from the magnetic
star or thermal or non-thermal emission due to interacting winds of the binary
system, especially for HD 47129. All the detected stars are predicted to host
centrifugal magnetospheres except HD 37742, which is likely to host a dynamical

  Linear Convergence Rate",,,,,"math.OC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, there has been growing interest in developing optimization methods
for solving large-scale machine learning problems. Most of these problems boil
down to the problem of minimizing an average of a finite set of smooth and
strongly convex functions where the number of functions $n$ is large. Gradient
descent method (GD) is successful in minimizing convex problems at a fast
linear rate; however, it is not applicable to the considered large-scale
optimization setting because of the high computational complexity. Incremental
methods resolve this drawback of gradient methods by replacing the required
gradient for the descent direction with an incremental gradient approximation.
They operate by evaluating one gradient per iteration and executing the average
of the $n$ available gradients as a gradient approximate. Although, incremental
methods reduce the computational cost of GD, their convergence rates do not
justify their advantage relative to GD in terms of the total number of gradient
evaluations until convergence. In this paper, we introduce a Double Incremental
Aggregated Gradient method (DIAG) that computes the gradient of only one
function at each iteration, which is chosen based on a cyclic scheme, and uses
the aggregated average gradient of all the functions to approximate the full
gradient. The iterates of the proposed DIAG method uses averages of both
iterates and gradients in oppose to classic incremental methods that utilize
gradient averages but do not utilize iterate averages. We prove that not only
the proposed DIAG method converges linearly to the optimal solution, but also
its linear convergence factor justifies the advantage of incremental methods on
GD. In particular, we prove that the worst case performance of DIAG is better
than the worst case performance of GD.

of substrate strength, wave speed, disk activity, and disk density, a variety
of dynamical phases arise that are correlated with the structure and net flux
of disks. We find that there is a sharp transition into a state where the disks
are only partially coupled to the substrate and form a phase separated cluster
state. This transition is associated with a drop in the net disk flux and can
occur as a function of the substrate speed, maximum substrate force, disk run
time, and disk density. Since variation of the disk activity parameters
produces different disk drift rates for a fixed traveling wave speed on the
substrate, the system we consider could be used as an efficient method for
active matter species separation. Within the cluster phase, we find that in
some regimes the motion of the cluster center of mass is in the opposite
direction to that of the traveling wave, while when the maximum substrate force
is increased, the cluster drifts in the direction of the traveling wave. This
suggests that swarming or clustering motion can serve as a method by which an
active system can collectively move against an external drift.

protocols rely on a fundamental relation between the non-locality of quantum

a trade-off between the probability of guessing correctly the outcomes of

given Bell inequality. However, a more accurate assessment of the randomness

introduce protocols for device-independent randomness generation, secure
against classical side information, that rely on the estimation of an arbitrary

multicomponent DM consisting of spin-1 and spin-0 states. This UV complete
set-up is based on SU(3) hidden gauge symmetry with the minimal scalar field
content to break it spontaneously. The presence of multiple DM components is a
result of a residual Z_2 x Z'_2 symmetry which is part of an unbroken global
U(1) x Z'_2 inherent in the Yang-Mills systems. We find that the model exhibits
various parametric regimes with drastically different DM detection prospects.

suppressed in large regions of parameter space as long as the Standard Model
Higgs mixes predominantly with a single scalar from the hidden sector. The
resulting scattering rate is often beyond the level of sensitivity of XENON1T,

more robust against projection effects in the cluster membership
identification. Using the angular mark correlation functions of clusters, we
show that the large-scale bias differences when splitting by $R_{\mathrm{mem}}$
can be largely attributed to such projection effects. After splitting by
$\tilde{R}_{\mathrm{mem}}$, the anomalously large signal is reduced, giving a
ratio of $1.02\pm0.14$ between the two clustering biases as measured from weak
lensing. Using a realistic mock cluster catalog, we predict that the bias ratio
between two $\tilde{R}_{\mathrm{mem}}$-split subsamples should be $<1.10$,
which is at least 60% weaker than the maximum halo assembly bias signal (1.24)
when split by halo concentration. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the
level of halo assembly bias exhibited by redMaPPer clusters in SDSS is
consistent with the LCDM prediction. With a ten-fold increase in cluster
numbers, deeper ongoing surveys will enable a more robust detection of halo
assembly bias. Our findings also have important implications for how projection
effects and their impact on cluster cosmology can be quantified in photometric
cluster catalogs.

of specific star-formation rate (SSFR) versus galaxy stellar mass: a
star-forming Galaxy Main Sequence (GMS) and a separate region of `passive' or
`red and dead galaxies'. Starting from a volume-limited sample of nearby
galaxies designed to contain most of the stellar mass in this volume, and thus
being a fair representation of the Universe at the end of 12 billion years of
galaxy evolution, we investigate the distribution of galaxies in this diagram
today. We show that galaxies follow a strongly curved extended GMS with a steep
negative slope at high galaxy stellar masses. There is a gradual change in the
morphologies of the galaxies along this distribution, but there is no clear
break between early-type and late-type galaxies. Examining the other evidence
that there are two distinct populations, we argue that the `red sequence' is
the result of the colours of galaxies changing very little below a critical
value of the SSFR, rather than implying a distinct population of galaxies, and
that Herschel observations, which show at least half of early-type galaxies
contain a cool interstellar medium, also imply continuity between early-type
and late-type galaxies. This picture of a unitary population of galaxies
requires more gradual evolutionary processes than the rapid quenching processes
needed to to explain two distinct populations. We challenge theorists to
reproduce the properties of this `Galaxy End Sequence'.

escape fraction of Lyman continuum photons ($f_{\rm esc}$) in high-redshift
galaxies. Approximating the turbulence as isothermal and isotropic, we show
that the increase in the variance in column densities from $\mathcal{M}=1$ to
$\mathcal{M}=10$ causes $f_{\rm esc}$ to increase by $\approx 25$\%, and the
increase from $\mathcal{M}=1$ to $\mathcal{M}=20$ causes $f_{\rm esc}$ to
increases by $\approx 50$\% for a medium with opacity $\tau\approx1$. At a
fixed Mach number, the correction factor for escape fraction relative to a
constant column density case scales exponentially with the opacity in the cell,
which has a large impact for simulated star forming regions. Furthermore, in
simulations of isotropic turbulence with full atomic/ionic cooling and
chemistry, the fraction of HI drops by a factor of $\approx 2.5$ at
$\mathcal{M}\approx10$ even when the mean temperature is $\approx5\times10^3
K$. If turbulence is unresolved, these effects together enhance $f_{\rm esc}$
by a factor $>3$ at Mach numbers above 10. Such Mach numbers are common at
high-redshifts where vigorous turbulence is driven by supernovae, gravitational
instabilities, and merger activity, as shown both by numerical simulations and
observations. These results, if implemented in the current hydrodynamical
cosmological simulations to account for unresolved turbulence, can boost the
theoretical predictions of the Lyman Continuum photon escape fraction and

much additional energy density can be placed in different components beyond

and late-universe information enclosed in observational data, thus markedly
reducing the model-dependency of the conclusions. We find that the 95\%
credibility regions for extra energy components of the early universe at
recombination are: non-accelerating additional fluid density parameter
$\Omega_{\rm MR} < 0.006$ and extra radiation parameterised as extra effective
neutrino species $2.3 < N_{\rm eff} < 3.2$ when imposing flatness. Our
constraints thus show that even when analyzing the data in this largely
model-independent way, the possibility of hiding extra energy components beyond
$\Lambda$CDM in the early universe is seriously constrained by current
observations. We also find that the standard ruler, the sound horizon at
radiation drag, can be well determined in a way that does not depend on
late-time Universe assumptions, but depends strongly on early-time physics and
in particular on additional components that behave like radiation. We find that
the standard ruler length determined in this way is $r_{\rm s} = 147.4 \pm 0.7$
Mpc if the radiation and neutrino components are standard, but the uncertainty
increases by an order of magnitude when non-standard dark radiation components
are allowed, to $r_{\rm s} = 150 \pm 5$ Mpc.

such phenomena can be described by a thin-film (or long-wave or lubrication)

dynamics of droplets on both, an adsorption (or precursor) layer and completely
dry substrates. At the molecular scale, commonly used two-term binding
potentials with a single preferred minimum controlling the adsorption layer
height are inadequate to capture the rich behaviour caused by the near-wall
layered molecular packing. The adsorption layer is often sub-monolayer in
thickness, i.e., the dynamics along the layer consists of single-particle
hopping, leading to a diffusive dynamics, rather than the collective
hydrodynamic motion implicit in standard thin-film models. We therefore modify

current acceleration of the Universe. These three set-ups are described
classically by perfect fluids with a phantom nature and represent deviations
from the most widely accepted $\Lambda$CDM model. In addition, each of the
models under study induce different future singularities or abrupt events known
as (i) Big Rip, (ii) Little Rip and (iii) Little Sibling of the Big Rip. Only
the first one is regarded as a true singularity since it occurs at a finite
cosmic time. For this reason, we refer to the others as abrupt events. With the
aim to find possible footprints of this scenario in the Universe matter
distribution, we not only obtain the evolution of the cosmological scalar
perturbations but also calculate the matter power spectrum for each model. We
have carried the perturbations in the absence of any anisotropic stress and
within a phenomenological approach for the speed of sound. We constrain
observationally these models using several measurements of the growth rate
function, more precisely $f\sigma_8$, and compare our results with the
observational ones.

simulated OVI emission to observations is therefore a valuable test of whether

$\lambda$1032\AA\ emission, assuming collisional ionization equilibrium, for
our small-box simulations of the stratified ISM regulated by supernovae. We
find that the agreement is very good for our solar neighborhood model, both in

Observations of OVI emission are rare for external galaxies, but our results do

solution to address the routing scalability problem, because it does not use
traditional forwarding tables or exchange routing updates upon changes in
network topologies. Although HR has the drawbacks of producing sub-optimal
routes or local minima for some destinations, these issues can be mitigated by
NDN's intelligent data forwarding plane. However, HR's viability still depends
on both the quality of the routes HR provides and the overhead incurred at the
forwarding plane due to HR's sub-optimal behavior. We designed a new forwarding
strategy called Adaptive Smoothed RTT-based Forwarding (ASF) to mitigate HR's
sub-optimal path selection. This paper describes our experimental investigation
into the packet delivery delay and overhead under HR as compared with
Named-Data Link State Routing (NLSR), which calculates shortest paths. We run
emulation experiments using various topologies with different failure
scenarios, probing intervals, and maximum number of next hops for a name
prefix. Our results show that HR's delay stretch has a median close to 1 and a
95th-percentile around or below 2, which does not grow with the network size.
HR's message overhead in dynamic topologies is nearly independent of the
network size, while NLSR's overhead grows polynomially at least. These results
suggest that HR offers a more scalable routing solution with little impact on
the optimality of routing paths.

AGN disk winds may be due to thermal instability. The ions responsible for
forming the observed X-ray absorption lines may only exist in relatively cold
clumps that can be identified with the so-called 'warm absorbers'. Here we
calculate synthetic absorption lines for such warm absorbers from first
principles by combining 2D hydrodynamic solutions of a two-phase medium with a
dense grid of photoionization models to determine the detailed ionization
structure of the gas. Our calculations reveal that cloud disruption, which
leads to a highly complicated velocity field (i.e. a clumpy flow), will only
mildly affect line shapes and strengths when the cold gas becomes highly mixed
but not depleted. Prior to complete disruption, clouds which are optically thin
to the driving UV resonance lines will cause absorption at an increasingly
blueshifted line of sight velocity as they are accelerated. This behavior will
imprint an identifiable signature on the line profile if warm absorbers are
enshrouded in an even broader absorption line produced by a high column of
intercloud gas. Interestingly, we show that it is possible to develop a
spectral diagnostic for cloud acceleration by differencing the absorption
components of a doublet line, a result which can be qualitatively understood
using a simple partial covering model. Our calculations also permit us to
comment on the spectral differences between cloud disruption and ionization
changes driven by flux variability. Notably, cloud disruption offers another
possibility for explaining absorption line variability.

emission, with a radio luminosity (L_rad) of 24 mJy kpc^2 at 45 GHz, in the
inner 1000 AU from an O-type YSO. The radio thermal jet has an opening angle of
44 degrees and brings a momentum rate of 8 10^-3 M_sun yr^-1 km/s. By combining
the new data with previous observations of the molecular outflow and water
maser shocks, we can trace the outflow emission from its driving source through
the molecular clump, across more than two order of magnitude in length (500
AU-0.2 pc). We find that the momentum-transfer efficiency, between the inner
jet emission and the extended outflow of entrained ambient gas, is near unity.
This result suggests that the large-scale flow is swept-up by the mechanical
force of the radio jet emission, which originates in the inner 1000 AU from the

$$J[u]=\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u(x)|^2\,dx+\Phi\big({\mathcal M}_-(u),
{\mathcal{M}}_+(u)\big), \quad u-\bar u\in W^{1,2}_0(\Omega), $$ where $\bar
u\in W^{1,2}(\Omega)$ is a given boundary datum. Here, ${\mathcal M}_1$ and
${\mathcal M}_2$ are weighted volumes of $\{u\le 0\}\cap \Omega$ and
$\{u>0\}\cap \Omega$, respectively, and $\Phi$ is a nonnegative function of two
real variables.
  We show that, for this problem, the Bernoulli constant, which determines the
gradient jump condition across the free boundary, is of global type and it is
indeed determined by the weighted volumes of the phases.
  In particular, the Bernoulli condition that we obtain can be seen as a
pressure prescription in terms of the volume of the two phases of the minimizer
itself (and therefore it depends on the minimizer itself and not only on the
structural constants of the problem).
  Another property of this type of problems is that the minimizer in $\Omega$
is not necessarily a minimizer in a smaller subdomain, due to the nonlinear
structure of the problem.
  Due to these features, this problem is highly unstable as opposed to the
classical case studied by Alt, Caffarelli and Friedman. It also interpolates
the classical case, in the sense that the blow-up limits of $u$ are minimizers
of the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman functional. Namely, the energy of the problem
somehow linearizes in the blow-up limit.
  As a special case, we can deal with the energy levels generated by the volume
term $\Phi(0, r_2)=r_2^{\frac{n-1}n}$, which interpolates the
Athanasopoulos-Caffarelli-Kenig-Salsa energy, thanks to the isoperimetric
inequality.
  In particular, we develop a detailed optimal regularity theory for the
minimizers and for their free boundaries.

itself more simply as inseparable higher dimensional quantum superposition. In
this paper we establish the discordlike correlation of bipartite coherence and
then compare it to quantum discord. Consequently, we show that the minimum of
the discordlike correlation of coherence coincides with the original quantum
discord. This demonstrates quantum discord as the irreducible correlated
bipartite coherence. In addition, the discordlike correlated coherence is shown
to admit the postulates of the quantum resource theory (QRT), although the

nontopological soliton solutions are shown to exist that separate an Anti-de
Sitter (AdS) true vacuum interior from a Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) false vacuum
exterior. The stability of these bubble solutions is tested by perturbing the
charge of the coherent solution and evolving the time-dependent equations of
motion. In the weak gravitational limit, the short-term stability depends on
the sign of $(\omega/ Q) \, \partial_\omega Q$, similar to q-balls. The
long-term end state of the perturbed solutions demonstrates a rich structure
and is visualized using ""phase diagrams."" Regions of both stability and
instability are shown to exist for $\kappa_g \lesssim 0.015$, while solutions
with $\kappa_g \gtrsim 0.015$ were observed to be entirely unstable. Threshold
solutions are shown to demonstrate time-scaling laws, and the space separating
true and false vacuum end states is shown to be fractal in nature, similar to
oscillons. Coherent states with superextremal charge-to-mass ratios are shown
to exist and observed to collapse or expand, depending on the sign of the
charge perturbation. Expanding superextremal bubbles induce a phase transition
to the true AdS vacuum, while collapsing superextremal bubbles can form
nonsingular strongly gravitating solutions with superextremal RN exteriors.

This provides us with the underlying classical phase space for $SU(1,1)$ spin
networks describing timelike boundaries and their extension into the bulk.
Applying a Dirac quantization we show that the reduced Hilbert space is spanned
by $SU(1,1)$ spin networks and hence are able to give a quantum description of

interconvertible local structures. If the non-ideality in the Gibbs energy of
mixing overcomes the ideal entropy of mixing of these two structures, a
liquid-liquid phase transition, terminated at a liquid-liquid critical point,
is predicted. Various versions of the ""two-structure equation of state"" (TSEOS)
based on this concept have shown remarkable agreement with both experimental
data for metastable, deeply supercooled water and simulations of molecular
water models. However, existing TSEOSs were not designed to describe the
negative pressure region and do not account for the stability limit of the
liquid state with respect to the vapor. While experimental data on supercooled
water at negative pressures may shed additional light on the source of the
anomalies of water, such data are very limited. To fill this gap, we have
analyzed simulation results for TIP4P/2005, one of the most accurate classical
water models available. We have used recently published simulation data, and
performed additional simulations, over a broad range of positive and negative
pressures, from ambient temperature to deeply supercooled conditions. We show
that, by explicitly incorporating the liquid-vapor spinodal into a TSEOS, we
are able to match the simulation data for TIP4P/2005 with remarkable accuracy.
In particular, this equation of state quantitatively reproduces the lines of
extrema in density, isothermal compressibility, and isobaric heat capacity.
Contrary to an explanation of the thermodynamic anomalies of water based on a
""retracing spinodal"", the liquid-vapor spinodal in the present TSEOS continues
monotonically to lower pressures upon cooling, influencing but not giving rise
to density extrema and other thermodynamic anomalies.

signal of neutrons and gamma rays in organic scintillation detectors is
presented. The method is based on the transformation of signals into the
frequency domain using the sine and cosine Fourier transforms in combination
with the discrete Fourier transform. The method is largely benefited from
considerable differences that usually is available between the zero-frequency
components of sine and cosine and the norm of the amplitude of the DFT for
neutrons and gamma-ray signals. Moreover, working in frequency domain naturally
results in considerable suppression of the unwanted effects of various noise
sources that is expected to be effective in time domain methods. The proposed
method could also be assumed as a generalized nonlinear weighting method that
could result in a new class of pulse shape discrimination methods, beyond
definition of the DFT. A comparison to the traditional Charge Integration
Method (CIM), as well as the Frequency Gradient Analysis Method (FGAM) and the
Wavelet Packet Transform Method (WPTM) has been presented to demonstrate the
applicability and efficiency of the method for real-world applications. The
method, in general, shows better discrimination Figure of Merits (FoMs) at both
the low-light outputs and in average over the studied energy domain. A noise
analysis has been performed for all of the abovementioned methods. It reveals

alleviate this problem is to exploit the Bayesian approach by using Bayesian

problems, we propose a class of probabilistic neural networks, dubbed
natural-parameter networks (NPN), as a novel and lightweight Bayesian treatment
of NN. NPN allows the usage of arbitrary exponential-family distributions to
model the weights and neurons. Different from traditional NN and BNN, NPN takes
distributions as input and goes through layers of transformation before
producing distributions to match the target output distributions. As a Bayesian
treatment, efficient backpropagation (BP) is performed to learn the natural
parameters for the distributions over both the weights and neurons. The output
distributions of each layer, as byproducts, may be used as second-order
representations for the associated tasks such as link prediction. Experiments

team with NA attackers and a defending team with ND defenders playing on a
compact domain with obstacles. The attacking team aims to send M of the NA
attackers to some target location, while the defending team aims to prevent
that by capturing attackers or indefinitely delaying attackers from reaching
the target. Although the analysis of this game plays an important role in many
applications, the optimal solution to this game is computationally intractable
when NA>1 or ND>1. In this paper, we present two approaches for the NA=ND=1
case to determine pairwise outcomes, and a graph theoretic maximum matching
approach to merge these pairwise outcomes for an NA,ND>1 solution that provides
guarantees on the performance of the defending team. We will show that the
four-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs approach allows for real-time updates
to the maximum matching, and that the two-dimensional ""path defense"" approach
is considerably more scalable with the number of players while maintaining
defender performance guarantees.

on the layer instability phenomenon in binary polycrystalline thin film
initiating from the grain boundary migrations at higher temperatures using
phase-field simulations. Effect of layer thickness, bilayer spacing and the
absence of grain boundary are also investigated along with the grain boundary
mobility of individual phases on the layer stability. Layer instability in the
polycrystalline film is shown to arise from the grain boundary grooving which
originates spontaneously from the presence of grain boundaries. Our results
show that the growth of the perturbation generated from the differential
curvature follows Plateau-Rayleigh instability criterion. Increase in layer
thickness, lower bilayer thickness as well as lower grain boundary mobility
improve layer stability. Phase-field simulations show similar microstructural
evolution as has been observed in our Zirconium (Zr)/Zirconium Nitride (ZrN)

mechanisms of layer instability leads us to predict measures which will improve

For
this purpose, we employ a canonical ensemble of classical monoatomic ideal gas
inside a box in a Rindler spacetime. The total energy decreases monotonically
with the increase of the external gravity representing its attractiveness. It
is however bounded below, which is different from that of the Newtonian gravity
case. As for the entropy, it decreases with the external gravity in the
Newtonian regime. However, in the presence of strong gravity or
ultra-relativistic high temperature, the entropy increases with the gravity.
This result can be a resolution of the negative entropy problem of the ideal
gas in the Newtonian gravity. In the presence of strong gravity, the bottom of
the box is very close to the event horizon of the Rindler spacetime mimicking a
blackhole and the gas behaves as if it is on an effective two dimensional
surface located at the bottom of the box. Investigating the equation of state
in the strong gravity regime, the temperature of the system is found to be not
a free parameter but to approach a fixed value proportional to the external
gravity, which is reminiscent of the Unruh temperature.

user-channel estimation and data transmission are performed in parallel over
non-overlapping angular sectors. The uplink training schemes we consider are
non-orthogonal, that is, we allow multiple users to transmit pilots on the same

processing allows each sector to determine the subset of user channels that can
be resolved on the sector (effectively pilot contamination free) and, thus, the
subset of users that can be served by the sector. This allows resolving
multiple users on the same pilot dimension at different sectors, thereby
increasing the overall multiplexing gains of the system. Our analysis and

used in many recommender systems. However, most of them use either handcrafted
features or the bag-of-words representation as a surrogate for the content
information but they are neither effective nor natural enough. To address this
problem, we develop a collaborative recurrent autoencoder (CRAE) which is a
denoising recurrent autoencoder (DRAE) that models the generation of content
sequences in the collaborative filtering (CF) setting. The model generalizes
recent advances in recurrent deep learning from i.i.d. input to non-i.i.d.
(CF-based) input and provides a new denoising scheme along with a novel
learnable pooling scheme for the recurrent autoencoder. To do this, we first
develop a hierarchical Bayesian model for the DRAE and then generalize it to
the CF setting. The synergy between denoising and CF enables CRAE to make
accurate recommendations while learning to fill in the blanks in sequences.
Experiments on real-world datasets from different domains (CiteULike and
Netflix) show that, by jointly modeling the order-aware generation of sequences
for the content information and performing CF for the ratings, CRAE is able to
significantly outperform the state of the art on both the recommendation task

quantify the leakage. The most followed approaches to defining appropriate
measures are those based on information theory. In particular, one of the most
successful approaches is the recently proposed $g$-leakage framework, which
encompasses most of the information-theoretic ones. A problem with $g$-leakage,
however, is that it is defined in terms of a minimization problem, which, in
the case of large systems, can be computationally rather heavy. In this paper
we study the case in which the channel associated to the system can be
decomposed into simpler channels, which typically happens when the observables
consist of multiple components. Our main contribution is the derivation of
bounds on the (multiplicative version of) $g$-leakage of the whole system in

Based on this framework, we introduce two types of DANs for multimodal

useful for tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). In addition, the
matching model exploits the two attention mechanisms to estimate the similarity

  In this paper, we introduce learning sub-word level representations in LSTM
(Subword-LSTM) architecture instead of character-level or word-level
representations. This linguistic prior in our architecture enables us to learn
the information about sentiment value of important morphemes. This also seems
to work well in highly noisy text containing misspellings as shown in our
experiments which is demonstrated in morpheme-level feature maps learned by our

Subword-LSTM architecture leads to the superior performance. Our system attains
accuracy 4-5% greater than traditional approaches on our dataset, and also
outperforms the available system for sentiment analysis in Hi-En code-mixed

star-forming galaxies are rare, leaving uncertain the role of external gas
acquisition in driving evolution of blue galaxies. Based on new measurements
with integral field spectroscopy of a large representative galaxy sample, we
find an appreciable fraction of counter-rotators among blue galaxies (9 out of

coming from multiple sources, known as ""multi-view data"". Multi-view clustering
provides a natural way to generate clusters from such data. Since different
views share some consistency and complementary information, previous works on
multi-view clustering mainly focus on how to combine various numbers of views
to improve clustering performance. However, in reality, each view may be
incomplete, i.e., instances missing in the view. Furthermore, the size of data
could be extremely huge. It is unrealistic to apply multi-view clustering in
large real-world applications without considering the incompleteness of views
and the memory requirement. None of previous works have addressed all these
challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an online multi-view
clustering algorithm, OMVC, which deals with large-scale incomplete views. We
model the multi-view clustering problem as a joint weighted nonnegative matrix
factorization problem and process the multi-view data chunk by chunk to reduce
the memory requirement. OMVC learns the latent feature matrices for all the
views and pushes them towards a consensus. We further increase the robustness
of the learned latent feature matrices in OMVC via lasso regularization. To
minimize the influence of incompleteness, dynamic weight setting is introduced
to give lower weights to the incoming missing instances in different views.
More importantly, to reduce the computational time, we incorporate a faster
projected gradient descent by utilizing the Hessian matrices in OMVC. Extensive
experiments conducted on four real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed OMVC method.

propose the RElative COre MErge (RECOME) clustering algorithm. The core of
RECOME is a novel density measure, i.e., Relative $K$ nearest Neighbor Kernel
Density (RNKD). RECOME identifies core objects with unit RNKD, and {partitions}
non-core objects into atom clusters by successively following higher-density
neighbor relations toward core objects. Core objects and their corresponding
atom clusters are then merged through $\alpha$-reachable paths on a KNN graph.
We discover that the number of clusters computed by RECOME is a step function
of the $\alpha$ parameter with jump discontinuity on a small collection of
values. A fast jump discontinuity discovery (FJDD) method is proposed based on
graph theory. RECOME is evaluated on both synthetic datasets and real datasets.
Experimental results indicate that RECOME is able to discover clusters with
different shapes, densities, and scales. It outperforms six baseline methods on
both synthetic datasets and real datasets. Moreover, FJDD is shown to be
effective to extract the jump discontinuity set of parameter $\alpha$ for all
tested datasets, which can ease the task of data exploration and parameter
tuning.

\boldsymbol B$ is sufficiently large compared to the magnetic drift velocities.
On the other hand, when $\boldsymbol E \times \boldsymbol B$ and the magnetic
drift velocities are comparable, the tangential magnetic drift, which is
included in both the global and ZOW models, fills the role of suppressing
unphysical peaking of neoclassical radial-fluxes found in the other local
models at $E_r \simeq 0$. In low collisionality plasmas, in particular, the
tangential drift effect works well to suppress such unphysical behavior of the
radial transport caused in the simulations. It is demonstrated that the ZOW
model has the advantage of mitigating the unphysical behavior in the several
magnetic geometries, and that it also implements evaluation of bootstrap
current in LHD with the low computation cost compared to the global model.

introduced its tracial analog, the truncated tracial moment problem, which
replaces commuting variables with non-commuting ones and moments of $\mu$ with
tracial moments of matrices. In the bivariate quartic case, where indices run
over words in two variables of degree at most four, every sequence with a
positive definite $7\times 7$ moment matrix $\mathcal M_2$ can be represented
with tracial moments \cite{BK10,BK12}. In this article the case of singular
$\mathcal M_2$ is studied. For $\mathcal M_2$ of rank at most 5 the problem is
solved completely; namely, concrete measures are obtained whenever they exist
and the uniqueness question of the minimal measures is answered. For $\mathcal
M_2$ of rank 6 the problem splits into four cases, in two of which it is
equivalent to the feasibility problem of certain linear matrix inequalities.
Finally, the question of a flat extension of the moment matrix $\mathcal M_2$
is addressed. While this is the most powerful tool for solving the classical
case, it is shown here by examples that, while sufficient, flat extensions are
mostly not a necessary condition for the existence of a measure in the tracial

equation and its two types of approximations. One approximation is obtained as
a simple replacement of the noise term by a smeared noise with a proper
renormalization, while the other one introduced in [6] is suitable for studying
the invariant measures. By applying the paracontrolled calculus introduced by
Gubinelli et al. [8, 9], we show that two approximations have the common limit
under the properly adjusted choice of renormalization factors for each of these

of the coupled KPZ equation satisfy the so-called ""trilinear"" condition, the
renormalization factors can be taken the same in two approximations and the
difference of the limits of two approximations are explicitly computed.
Moreover, under the trilinear condition, the Wiener measure twisted by the
diffusion matrix becomes stationary for the limit and we show that the solution
of the limit equation exists globally in time when the initial value is sampled
from the stationary measure. This is shown for the associated tilt process.
Combined with the strong Feller property shown by Hairer and Mattingly [12],
this result can be extended for all initial values.

obtain that for any real $q>0$, the moment $\overline{Z_L^q} $ of order $q$ of

the events suitable for this framework. In this work, we strengthen this
notion, defining a novel directed notion of dependency and prove LLL for the
corresponding graph. We show that this graph can be strictly sparser (thus the
sufficient condition for LLL weaker) compared with graphs that correspond to
other extant lopsided versions of dependency. Thus, in a sense, we address the
problem ""find other simple local conditions for the constraints (in the
variable framework) that advantageously translate to some abstract lopsided

dependency graph gives better results than the classical Shearer lemma.

proofs, we perform a direct probabilistic analysis that yields an exponentially
small upper bound for the probability of the algorithm that searches for the
desired assignment to the variables not to return a correct answer within $n$

non-universal quantum computation. Since it has been proven that IQP circuits
are unlikely to be simulated classically up to a multiplicative error and an
error in the $l_1$ norm, IQP is considered as one of the promising classes that
demonstrates quantum supremacy. Although IQP circuits can be realized more
easily than a universal quantum computer, demonstrating quantum supremacy is
still difficult. It is therefore desired to find subclasses of IQP that are
easy to implement. In this paper, by imposing some restrictions on IQP, we
propose ancilla-driven IQP (ADIQP) as the subclass of commuting quantum
computation suitable for many experimental settings. We show that even though
ADIQP circuits are strictly weaker than IQP circuits in a sense, they are also
hard to simulate classically up to a multiplicative error and an error in the
$l_1$ norm. Moreover, the properties of ADIQP make it easy to investigate the
verifiability of ADIQP circuits and the difficulties in realizing ADIQP
circuits.

May 2006, by using a 3D model of the auroral radio emission from the stellar
magnetosphere. During this epoch, the radio light curves are characterised by
two pulses left-hand polarised at 4.88 GHz, and one doubly-peaked (of opposite
polarisations) pulse at 8.44 GHz. To take into account the possible deviation
from the dipolar symmetry of the stellar magnetic field topology, the model
described in this paper is also able to simulate the auroral radio emission
from a magnetosphere shaped like an offset-dipole. To reproduce the timing and
pattern of the observed pulses, we explored the space of parameters controlling
the auroral beaming pattern and the geometry of the magnetosphere. Through the
analysis of the TVLM513-46546 auroral radio emission, we derive some
indications on the magnetospheric field topology that is able to simultaneously
reproduce the timing and patterns of the auroral pulses measured at 4.88 and
8.44 GHz. Each set of model solutions simulates two auroral pulses (singly or
doubly peaked) per period. To explain the presence of only one 8.44 GHz pulse
per period, we analyse the case of auroral radio emission limited only to a
magnetospheric sector activated by an external body, like the case of the
interaction of Jupiter with its moons.

from any AGN, with velocities of 0.6-0.7c, requiring magnetic acceleration as
special relativisitic effects limit all radiatively driven winds to v<0.3-0.5c.
However, this extreme velocity derives from interpreting both the narrow and
broad absorption features in the X-ray spectrum as iron absorption lines. The
classic ultrafast outflow source PDS 456 also shows similar absorption systems,
but here the higher energy, broader feature is generally interpreted as an
absorption edge. We reanalyse all the spectra from APM 08279+5255 using a full
3-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer disc wind model for the ionised
wind at 0.1-0.2c, together with complex absorption from lower ionisation
material, and find that this is a better description of the data. Thus there is
no strong requirement for outflow velocities beyond 0.2c, which can be powered
by radiation driving. We show that UV line driving is especially likely given
the spectral energy distribution of this source which is intrinsically UV
bright and X-ray weak. While the peak of this emission is unobservable, it must
be luminous enough to power the observed hot dust, favouring at least moderate
black hole spin.

disorder, an insulating ground state is expected to emerge, as a result of a
direct superconductor-to-insulator quantum phase transition. In such systems,
no metallic state is theoretically expected to survive to the slightest
disorder. Here we map out the phase diagram of amorphous NbSi thin films as
functions of disorder and film thickness, with two metallic phases in between
the superconducting and insulating ones. These two dissipative states, defined
by a resistance which extrapolates to a finite value in the zero temperature

a surprising phenomenon in applications of the EM algorithm, i.e. the finite

oscillations in traffic flow has been subject to intensive research by the
traffic flow theory community. In our previous work, we proposed a new
mechanism to explain the generation of traffic oscillations: traffic
instability caused by the competition between speed adaptation and the
cumulative effect of stochastic factors. In this paper, by conducting a closer
examination of car following data obtained in a 25-car platoon experiment, we
discovered that the speed difference plays a more important role on
car-following dynamics than the spacing, and when its amplitude is small, the
growth of oscillations is mainly determined by the stochastic factors that
follow the mean reversion process; when its amplitude increases, the growth of
the oscillations is determined by the competition between the stochastic
factors and the speed difference. An explanation is then provided, based on the
above findings, to why the speed variance in the oscillatory traffic grows in a
concave way along the platoon. Finally, we proposed a mode-switching stochastic
car-following model that incorporates the speed adaptation and spacing
indifference behaviors of drivers, which captures the observed characteristics
of oscillation and discharge rate. Sensitivity analysis shows that reaction
delay only has slight effect but indifference region boundary has significant
on oscillation growth rate and discharge rate.

varies with galaxy physical parameters, i.e. M*, SFR and sSFR. According to
their sSFR, we further classify these 66 galaxies into three categories, 10
star-forming, 26 ""Green Valley"" and 30 quiescent ones. The properties of
different types of kinematically misaligned galaxies are different in that the
star-forming ones have positive gradient in D4000 and higher gas-phase
metallicity, while the green valley/quiescent ones have negative D4000
gradients and lower gas-phase metallicity on average. There is evidence that
all types of the kinematically misaligned galaxies tend to live in more
isolated environment. Based on all these observational results, we propose a
scenario for the formation of star forming galaxies with kinematically
misaligned gas and stars - the progenitor accretes misaligned gas from a
gas-rich dwarf or cosmic web, the cancellation of angular momentum from gas-gas
collisions between the pre-existing gas and the accreted gas largely
accelerates gas inflow, leading to fast centrally-concentrated star-formation.
The higher metallicity is due to enrichment from this star formation. For the
kinematically misaligned green valley and quiescent galaxies, they might be
formed through gas-poor progenitors accreting kinematically misaligned gas from
satellites which are smaller in mass.

with a second state, but the results of measurements made on the second state
are not accessible. As the second state has effectively ""measured"" the first,
in this paper we argue that the quantum Fisher information is the relevant
metric for predicting and quantifying this kind of decoherence. The quantum
Fisher information is usually used to determine an upper bound on how precisely
measurements on a state can be used to estimate a classical parameter, and as
such it is an important resource. Quantum enhanced metrology aims to create
non-classical states with large quantum Fisher information and utilise them in
precision measurements. In the process of doing this it is possible for states
to undergo decoherence, for instance atom-light interactions used to create
coherent superpositions of atomic states may result in atom-light entanglement.
Highly non-classical states, such as spin-cat states (Schr\""odinger cat states
constructed from superpositions of collective spins) are shown to be highly
susceptible to this kind of decoherence. We also investigate the required field
occupation of the second state, such that this decoherence is negligible.

stars. Red giants are targets of interest since they present mixed modes, which
behave as pressure modes in the convective envelope and as gravity modes in the
radiative core. Mixed modes thus directly probe red giant cores, and allow in
particular the study of their mean core rotation. The high-quality data
obtained by CoRoT and Kepler satellites represent an unprecedented perspective
to obtain thousands of measurements of red giant core rotation, in order to
improve our understanding of stellar physics in deep stellar interiors. We
developed an automated method to obtain such core rotation measurements and
validated it for stars on the red giant branch. In this work, we particularly
focus on the specific application of this method to red giants having a rapid
core rotation. They show complex spectra where it is tricky to disentangle
rotational splittings from mixed-mode period spacings. We demonstrate that the
method based on the identification of mode crossings is precise and efficient.
The determination of the mean core rotation directly derives from the precise
measurement of the asymptotic period spacing {\Delta}{\Pi}1 and of the
frequency at which the crossing of the rotational components is observed.

data, based on the hierarchical Dirichlet process, which supports these self
transitions and nonhomogeneity. Our model provides a parameterization of the
genetic process that is more parsimonious than other more general nonparametric

$C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2}$; consisting of a phenyl structure attached to an amino
group. It is colorless, but it slowly oxidizes and resinifies in air, giving a
red-brown tint to aged samples. Until now, there are only few researches on
Aniline considering low magnetic fields. In this work, we study Aniline
molecule under different high magnetic fields using density functional theory
methods including independent particle and interacting particle approaches. We
obtain charge density distrubitions, energy dispersions, dipol moments and
forces as functions of position and magnetic field. Our numerical results show
that magnetic field affects electron density of the considered molecule. As a
result, it is observed that there are strong fluctuations in energy dispersion.

between random variables, and they are also endorsed with solid theoretical
properties and convergence rates. Besides, the empirical estimates are easy to
compute in closed form just involving linear algebra operations. However, they
are hampered by two important problems: the high computational cost involved,
as two kernel matrices of the sample size have to be computed and stored, and
the interpretability of the measure, which remains hidden behind the implicit
feature map. We here address these two issues. We introduce the Sensitivity
Maps (SMs) for the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Sensitivity
maps allow us to explicitly analyze and visualize the relative relevance of
both examples and features on the dependence measure. We also present the
randomized HSIC (RHSIC) and its corresponding sensitivity maps to cope with
large scale problems. We build upon the framework of random features and the
Bochner's theorem to approximate the involved kernels in the canonical HSIC.
The power of the RHSIC measure scales favourably with the number of samples,
and it approximates HSIC and the sensitivity maps efficiently. Convergence
bounds of both the measure and the sensitivity map are also provided. Our
proposal is illustrated in synthetic examples, and challenging real problems of
dependence estimation, feature selection, and causal inference from empirical

prioritization and understanding on several key concepts are not yet agreed by
major vendors and network providers. Network Slicing is one of the central

generation networks, providing the flexibility required to support the variety
of 5G use cases and business. Network slices are seen as network operator
business, offering the possibility to provide flexible services and even
infrastructures to vertical industries and classical Telco customers alike.
Another key ingredient is the Architecture Modularisation concept, discussed in
this paper and regarded by the authors as the essential design principle to
build a flexible network architecture natively supporting Network Slicing.
According to this concept, conventional monolithic network functions, often
corresponding to physical network elements in the existing systems, are to
split into basic building blocks defined with the proper granularity, allowing
the definition of different logical architectures (i.e. different Network
Slices). In this paper, we further discuss a modularisation methodology as a
criteria to define the right set of basic building blocks. Defined through this
proposed methodology, the set of basic building blocks and the relating
interfacing model are discussed. The paper concludes by proposing a modular 5G

demanding. In this paper, we propose a verification framework to support
automated compositional reasoning for concurrent programs with shared
variables. Our framework models concurrent programs as succinct automata and
supports the verification of multiple important properties. Safety verification
and simulations of succinct automata are parallel compositional, and safety
properties of succinct automata are preserved under refinements. We generate
succinct automata from infinite state concurrent programs in an automated
manner. Furthermore, we propose the first automated approach to checking
rely-guarantee based simulations between infinite state concurrent programs. We
have prototyped our algorithms and applied our tool to the verification of
multiple refinements.

asymptotic behaviour of the sum of the number of periodic points for all primes
less than some bound, assuming the Extended Riemann Hypothesis. Later that same
year Chou and Shparlinski proved this asymptotic result without assuming any
unproven hypotheses.
  Inspired by this we perform experiments and find a striking pattern in the
behaviour of the sum of the number of periodic points for quadratic maps other

that the sum of the number of periodic points of all quadratic maps of this

study 20 different configurations for testing a web-store. We studied 5
programming language bindings (C#, Java, Python, and Ruby for Selenium, while
Watir supports Ruby only) and 4 browsers (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer,
Mozilla Firefox and Opera). Performance was measured with execution time,
memory usage, length of the test scripts and stability of the tests. Results:
Considering all measures the best configuration was Selenium with Python
language binding for Chrome. Selenium with Python bindings was the best option
for all browsers. The effect size of the difference between the slowest and
fastest configuration was very high (Cohens d=41.5, 91% increase in execution

results in the stability. Conclusions: We recommend benchmarking tools before
adopting them. Weighting of factors, e.g. how much test stability is one
willing to sacrifice for faster performance, affects the decision.

distributed implementations of data structures. It ensures that operations are
executed at all sites according to their causal precedence. We address the
issue of verifying automatically whether the executions of an implementation of
a data structure are causally consistent. We consider two problems: (1)
checking whether one single execution is causally consistent, which is relevant
for developing testing and bug finding algorithms, and (2) verifying whether
all the executions of an implementation are causally consistent.
  We show that the first problem is NP-complete. This holds even for the
read-write memory abstraction, which is a building block of many modern
distributed systems. Indeed, such systems often store data in key-value stores,
which are instances of the read-write memory abstraction. Moreover, we prove
that, surprisingly, the second problem is undecidable, and again this holds
even for the read-write memory abstraction. However, we show that for the
read-write memory abstraction, these negative results can be circumvented if
the implementations are data independent, i.e., their behaviors do not depend
on the data values that are written or read at each moment, which is a
realistic assumption.

and superconductivity, to name a few. Yet, magnetism, a property of extreme
importance in both science and technology, remains elusive. There is a
paramount need for magnetic two-dimensional crystals. With the availability of
many magnetic materials consisting of van der Waals coupled two-dimensional
layers, it thus boils down to the question of how the magnetic order will
evolve with reducing thickness. Here we investigate the effect of thickness on
the magnetic ordering in nanothick V$_5$S$_8$. We uncover an anomalous Hall
effect, by which the magnetic ordering in V$_5$S$_8$ down to 3.2 nm is probed.
With decreasing thickness, a breakdown of antiferromagnetism is evident,
followed by a spin-glass-like state. For thinnest samples, a weak ferromagnetic
ordering emerges. The results not only show an interesting effect of reducing
thickness on the magnetic ordering in a potential candidate for magnetic
two-dimensional crystals, but demonstrate the anomalous Hall effect as a useful
characterization tool for magnetic orderings in two-dimensional systems.

different. With increasing initial field strengths (from $6\times 10^{-3}$ to 3
$\mu$G) the simulations develop an ISM with a more homogeneous density and
temperature structure, with increasing mass (from 5% to 85%) and volume filling
fractions (from 4% to 85%) of warm (300 K $<$ T $<$ 8000 K) gas, with
decreasing volume filling fractions (VFF) from $\sim$ 35% to $\sim$ 12% of hot
gas (T $> 10^5$ K) and with a decreasing H$_{2}$ mass fraction (from 70% to $<$

dominates over the thermal pressure increases by a factor of 10, from 0.07 for
an initial field of $6\times 10^{-3}$ $\mu$G to 0.7 for a 3 $\mu$G initial

self-gravity promotes the formation of dense gas and H$_{2}$, but does not
change any other trends. We conclude that magnetic fields have a significant
impact on the multi-phase, chemical and thermal structure of the ISM and
discuss potential implications and limitations of the model.

nearby galaxies, there is now the potential to extract spectral information
from across the bulges and discs of galaxies in a systematic way. This
information can address questions such as how these components built up with
time, how galaxies evolve and whether their evolution depends on other
properties of the galaxy such as its mass or environment. We present BUDDI, a
new approach to fit the two-dimensional light profiles of galaxies as a
function of wavelength to extract the spectral properties of these galaxies'
discs and bulges. The fitting is carried out using GalfitM, a modified form of
Galfit which can fit multi-waveband images simultaneously. The benefit of this
technique over traditional multi-waveband fits is that the stellar populations
of each component can be constrained using knowledge over the whole image and
spectrum available. The decomposition has been developed using commissioning
data from the SDSS-IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey with
redshifts z<0.14 and coverage of at least 1.5 effective radii for a spatial
resolution of 2.5 arcsec FWHM and field of view of >22 arcsec, but can be
applied to any IFU data of a nearby galaxy with similar or better spatial
resolution and coverage. We present an overview of the fitting process, the
results from our tests, and we finish with example stellar population analyses
of early-type galaxies from the MaNGA survey to give an indication of the
scientific potential of applying bulge-disc decomposition to IFU data.

geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) for massive multiple-input

of massive MIMO channels such as near field effects and cluster evolution along
the array are addressed in this model. Near field effects are modelled by a
second-order approximation to spherical wavefronts, i.e., parabolic wavefronts,
leading to linear drifts of the angles of multipath components (MPCs) and
non-stationarity along the array. Cluster evolution along the array involving
cluster (dis)appearance and smooth average power variations is considered.
Cluster (dis)appearance is modeled by a two-state Markov process and smooth
average power variations are modelled by a spatial lognormal process.
Statistical properties of the channel model such as time autocorrelation
function (ACF), spatial cross-correlation function (CCF), and cluster average
power and Rician factor variations over the array are derived. Finally,
simulation results are presented and analyzed, demonstrating that parabolic
wavefronts and cluster soft evolution are good candidates to model important
massive MIMO channel characteristics.

X-ray luminosities above 10^39 erg/s powered by accretion onto compact objects.
According to the first studies performed with XMM-Newton ULXs seemed to be
excellent candidates to host intermediate-mass black holes (10^2-4 solar
masses). However, in the last years the interpretation of super-Eddington
accretion onto stellar-mass black holes or neutron stars for most ULXs has
gained a strong consensus. One critical missing piece to confirm the
super-Eddington scenario was the direct detection of the massive,
radiatively-driven winds expected as atomic emission/absorption lines in ULX
spectra. The first evidence for winds was found as residuals in the soft X-ray
spectra of ULXs. Most recently we have been able to resolve these residuals
into rest-frame emission and blueshifted (~0.2c) absorption lines arising from
highly ionized gas in the deep high-resolution XMM-Newton spectra of two
ultraluminous X-ray sources. The compact object is therefore surrounded by
powerful ultrafast winds as predicted by models of hyper-Eddington accretion.
Here we discuss the relevance of these discoveries and the importance of
further, deep, XMM-Newton observations of powerful winds in many other
ultraluminous X-ray sources to estimate the energetics of the wind, the
geometry of the system, and the masses of the central accretors.

evolution of the angular distribution can be solved in Fourier space. We
compare the results of the Fourier analysis with the ones obtained by using the

the system is recovered correctly. However, quantitatively there are serious
deviations. We introduce an extended von Mises distribution ansatz such that a
second term takes care of the next two Fourier modes. With the extended ansatz

in 17O. When mixing processes from the stellar surface reach these layers, as
occurs when stars become red giants and undergo the first dredge up, the
abundance of 17O increases. Such an occurrence explains the drop of the 16O/17O
observed in RGB stars with mass larger than 1.5 M_\solar. As a consequence, the
interstellar medium is continuously polluted by the wind of evolved stars
enriched in 17O . Aims. Recently, the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear
Astrophysics (LUNA) collaboration released an improved rate of the
17O(p,alpha)14N reaction. In this paper we discuss the impact that the revised
rate has on the 16O/17O ratio at the stellar surface and on 17O stellar yields.
Methods. We computed stellar models of initial mass between 1 and 20 M_\solar
and compared the results obtained by adopting the revised rate of the
17O(p,alpha)14N to those obtained using previous rates. Results. The post-first
dredge up 16O/17O ratios are about 20% larger than previously obtained.
Negligible variations are found in the case of the second and the third dredge
up. In spite of the larger 17O(p,alpha)14N rate, we confirm previous claims
that an extra-mixing process on the red giant branch, commonly invoked to
explain the low carbon isotopic ratio observed in bright low-mass giant stars,
marginally affects the 16O/17O ratio. Possible effects on AGB extra-mixing
episodes are also discussed. As a whole, a substantial reduction of 17O stellar
yields is found. In particular, the net yield of stars with mass ranging
between 2 and 20 M_\solar is 15 to 40% smaller than previously estimated.
Conclusions. The revision of the 17O(p,alpha)14N rate has a major impact on the
interpretation of the 16O/17O observed in evolved giants, in stardust grains
and on the 17O stellar yields.

was applied on a fibrin mechanical system with MMPs to calculate the stresses

application of a magnetic field of 730 A/m on the fibrin surface was necessary
to achieve an electromagnetic force of 36 nN (to engender plastic deformation).

energy spectrum. At a surface of a topological insulator, Dirac point is
protected by the characteristic symmetry of the system. The breaking of the
symmetry opens a gap in the energy spectrum. Therefore, topological insulators
are very sensitive to magnetic fields, which can open a gap in the electronic
spectrum. Concerning ""internal"" magnetic effects, for example the situation
with doped magnetic impurities, is not trivial. A single magnetic impurity is
not enough to open the band gap, while in the case of a ferromagnetic chain of
deposited magnetic impurities the Dirac point is lifted. However, a much more
interesting case is when localized magnetic impurities form a chiral spin
order. Our first principle density functional theory calculations have shown
that this is the case for Fe deposited on the surface of Bi2Se3 topological
insulator. But not only magnetic impurities can form a chiral helicoidal spin
texture. An alternative way is to use chiral multiferroics (prototype material
is LiCu2O2) that induce a proximity effect. The theoretical approach we present
here is valid for both cases. We observed that opposite to a ferromagnetically
ordered case, a chiral spin order does not destroy the Dirac point. We also
observed that the energy gap appears at the edges of the new Brillouin zone.
Another interesting result concerns the spin dynamics. We derived an equation
for the spin density dynamics with a spin current and relaxation terms. We have
shown that the motion of the conductance electron generates a magnetic torque
and exerts a certain force on the helicoidal texture.

Expressions are derived for the mean swimming velocities and the power, valid

and Jordan frames. We demand the dynamical evolution of the dark energy to be
weak enough, so that the present-day values of the cosmological parameters
could be estimated keeping them within the confidence limits set for the
standard $\L$CDM model from recent observations. For such estimates, we examine
the variations of the effective matter density and the dark energy equation of
state parameters over different redshift ranges. In spite of being weakly
dynamic, the dark energy component differs significantly from the cosmological
constant, both in characteristics and features, for e.g. it interacts with the
cosmological (dust) fluid in the Einstein frame, and crosses the phantom
barrier in the Jordan frame. We also obtain the upper bounds on the torsion
mode parameters and the lower bound on the effective Brans-Dicke parameter. The
latter turns out to be fairly large, and in agreement with the local gravity
constraints, which therefore come in support of our analysis.

examining the properties of its Floquet ground state. We specifically focus on
driving protocols with time-reversal invariant points, and demonstrate the
existence of an infinite number of distinct phases. These phases are separated
by second-order quantum phase transitions, accompanied by continuous changes of
local and string order parameters, as well as sudden changes of a topological
winding number and of the number of protected edge states. When one of these
phase transitions is adiabatically crossed, the correlator associated to the
order parameter is nonvanishing over a length scale which shows a Kibble-Zurek
