of describing the behavior of charged particle pencil beams in a medium, with
specific emphasis on proton beam scanning (PBS). Methods: The proton pencil
beams of a clinically commissioned proton treatment facility are replicated in
a Monte Carlo simulation system (FLUKA). For each available energy the beam
deposition in water medium is characterized by the dose deposition. Using an
alpha--stable distribution methodology each beam with a nominal energy $E$ is
characterized by the lateral spread at depth $z$: $S(z;\alpha,\gamma,E)$ and a
total energy deposition $I_D(z)$. The beams are then described as a function of
the variation of the parameters at depth. Finally, an implementation in a
freely available open source dose calculation suite (matRad, DKFZ, Heidelberg,
Germany) is proposed. Results: Quantitatively, the fit of the stable
distributions, compared to those implemented in standard treatment planning
systems, are equivalent. The efficiency of the representation is better (2
compared to 3 and more parameters needed). The meta--parametrization (i.e. the
description of the dose deposition by only providing the fitted parameters)
allows for interpolation of non--measured data. In the case of the clinical
data used in this paper, it was possible to only commission 1 out of 5 nominal
energies to obtain a viable data set. Conclusions: Alpha--stable distributions
are intrinsically suited to describe charged particle pencil beams in a medium
and can be easily implemented in existing treatment planning systems. The use
of alpha-distributions can easily be extended to other particles.

important for building a coherent picture that is emerging as the results of
theoretical calculations of various levels and experimental investigations
employing static and dynamic compression techniques. In this context, the use
of adequate probes of the electronic and chemical state is crucial. Optical
probes that do not address the energy dependent conductivity while making
multiple references to the Drude model are highly speculative. Indeed, the
available dynamic and static compression data and theoretical modeling show
that study of energy dependent conductivity is important for understanding the
nature of hot dense hydrogen. Moreover, the most recent investigations suggest
that the critical point, which demarcates the regimes of crossover between
insulating and plasma state at low densities to the first order liquid-liquid
transition, is above 200 GPa. Below we concentrate on inconsistencies in the
interpretation of data in Zaghoo et al, which call for careful examination of
their claims and further detailed investigations. We analyze their optical data
and use finite element calculations and argue that the high-temperature state
studied in Zaghoo et al. is not metallic and that the data cannot discriminate
between a first-order phase transition and a continuous phase transition, or
even a bandgap drop within one phase

canonically evolve together, starting and ending on shared Cauchy surfaces and
independently of the intermediate foliation, leaves one with little choice for
diffeomorphism-invariant gravitational dynamics that can provide consistent
evolution equations to the coefficients of a given system of matter field
equations. Concretely, we show how starting from any linear local matter field
equations whose principal polynomial satisfies three physicality conditions,
one may calculate coefficient functions which then enter an otherwise immutable
set of countably many linear homogeneous partial differential equations. Any
solution of these so-called gravitational closure equations then provides a
Lagrangian density for any type of tensorial geometry that features
ultralocally in the initially specified matter Lagrangian density. Thus the
given system of matter field equations is indeed closed by the so obtained
gravitational equations. In contrast to previous work, we build the theory on a
suitable associated bundle encoding the canonical configuration degrees of
freedom, which allows to include necessary constraints on the geometry in
practically tractable fashion. By virtue of the presented mechanism, one thus
can practically calculate, rather than having to postulate, the gravitational
theory that is required by specific matter field dynamics. For the special case
of standard model matter one obtains general relativity.

formula for a $n\times n$ dimensional Hamiltonian $H(\hat{\boldsymbol

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations, that act in a phase space endowed with a
classical Berry curvature encoding anholonomy in the parallel transport of the
eigenvectors of $H(\hat{\boldsymbol p}\to\boldsymbol p,\hat{\boldsymbol
q}\to\boldsymbol q)$, which describe the internal structure of the
semi-classical particles. This Berry curvature is a fully classical object and
is, in that sense, as fundamental to the semi-classical theory of matrix
Hamiltonians as the Hamilton-Jacobi equations. At the $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^1)$
level, it results in an additional semi-classical phase composed of (i) a Berry
phase and (ii) a dynamical phase resulting from the classical particles ""moving
through the Berry curvature"". We show that the dynamical part of this
semi-classical phase will, generally, only be zero only for the case in which
the Berry phase is topological (i.e. depends only on the winding number). We
illustrate the method by calculating the Landau spectrum for monolayer
graphene, the four-band model of AB bilayer graphene, and for a more
complicated matrix Hamiltonian describing the silicene band structure. Finally
we apply our method to an inhomogeneous system consisting of a strain
engineered one dimensional moir\'e in bilayer graphene, finding localized
states near the Dirac point that arise from electron trapping in a
semi-classical moir\'e potential. The semi-classical density of states of these
localized states we show to be in perfect agreement with an exact quantum

reconfigurable hardware. They are used in modern systems, creating specialized,
highly-optimized integrated circuits without the need to design and manufacture
dedicated chips. As the capacity of FPGAs grows, it is increasingly common for
designers to incorporate implementations of algorithms and protocols from a
range of third-party sources. The monolithic nature of FPGAs means that all
on-chip circuits, including third party black-box designs, must share common
on-chip infrastructure, such as routing resources. In this paper, we observe
that a ""long"" routing wire carrying a logical 1 reduces the propagation delay
of other adjacent but unconnected long wires in the FPGA interconnect, thereby
leaking information about its state. We exploit this effect and propose a
communication channel that can be used for both covert transmissions between
circuits, and for exfiltration of secrets from the chip. We show that the
effect is measurable for both static and dynamic signals, and that it can be
detected using very small on-board circuits. In our prototype, we are able to
correctly infer the logical state of an adjacent long wire over 99% of the
time, even without error correction, and for signals that are maintained for as
little as 82us. Using a Manchester encoding scheme, our channel bandwidth is as
high as 6kbps. We characterize the channel in detail and show that it is
measurable even when multiple competing circuits are present and can be
replicated on different generations and families of Xilinx devices (Virtex 5,
Virtex 6, and Artix 7). Finally, we propose countermeasures that can be
deployed by systems and tools designers to reduce the impact of this
information leakage.

spectra, we confirm the traditional Baldwin effect (BE, i.e., the
anticorrelation of C IV equivalent width (EW) and luminosity) that follows the
relation W_\lambda \propto L^{\beta_w} with slope \beta_w = -0.35 \pm 0.004,

find redshift evolution in average quasar spectral features at fixed
luminosity. The spectroscopic signature of the redshift evolution is correlated
at 98% with the signature of varying luminosity, indicating that they arise
from the same physical mechanism. At a fixed luminosity, the average C IV FWHM
decreases with increasing redshift and is anti-correlated with C IV EW. The
spectroscopic signature associated with C IV FWHM suggests that the trends in
luminosity and redshift are likely caused by a superposition of effects that

the consequence of a changing balance between these two quantities as quasars
evolve toward a population with lower typical accretion rates at a given black
hole mass.

GaAs quantum wells placed in titled magnetic fields. Quantum positive
magnetoresistance (QPMR) is observed in magnetic fields perpendicular to the 2D
layer. Application of in-plane magnetic field produces a dramatic decrease of
the QPMR. This decrease correlates strongly with the reduction of the amplitude
of Shubnikov de Haas resistance oscillations due to modification of the
electron spectrum via enhanced Zeeman splitting. Surprisingly no quantization
of the spectrum is detected when the Zeeman energy exceeds the half of the
cyclotron energy suggesting an abrupt transformation of the electron dynamics.
Observed angular evolution of QPMR implies strong mixing between spin subbands.
Theoretical estimations indicate that in the presence of spin-orbital

we find the optimal hyperfine interaction Hamiltonian that leads to the best

multi-level Voronoi-based encoding uses a spatial hierarchical K-means over
interest-point locations, and computes a content-based descriptor over each

in retrieval performance: (i) we utilize the tree structure of the spatial
hierarchical K-means to perform a top-to-bottom pruning for local similarity
maxima; (ii) we propose a new image similarity score that combines relevant

(iii) we combine our proposal with a novel and efficient approach for optimal

queries in two standard datasets, it is shown that the Voronoi-based

conventional grid-based spatial search, while offering more than two-fold

find that a single population of GRB pulses with an evolving luminosity

luminosity functions in reproducing the observed GRB pulse L-z distribution and
that the magnitude of the evolution in brightness is consistent with studies
that utilize only the brightest GRB pulses. We determine that the appearance of
a GRB formation rate density evolution component is an artifact of poor
parametrization of the CSFRD at high redshifts rather than indicating evolution
in the formation rate of early epoch GRBs. We conclude that the single

of the electorate come in as a list of votes. Depending on the context, it may
be much more natural to represent the list succinctly, as the distinct votes of
the electorate and their counts, i.e., high-multiplicity representation. We
consider how this representation affects the complexity of election problems.
High-multiplicity representation may be exponentially smaller than standard
representation, and so many polynomial-time algorithms for election problems in
standard representation become exponential-time. Surprisingly, for
polynomial-time election problems, we are often able to either adapt the same
approach or provide new algorithms to show that these problems remain
polynomial-time in the high-multiplicity case; this is in sharp contrast to the
case where each voter has a weight, where the complexity usually increases. In
the process we explore the relationship between high-multiplicity scheduling
and manipulation of high-multiplicity elections. And we show that for any fixed
set of job lengths, high-multiplicity scheduling on uniform parallel machines
is in P, which was previously known for only two job lengths. We did not find
any natural case where a polynomial-time election problem does not remain in P
when moving to high-multiplicity representation. However, we found one natural
NP-hard election problem where the complexity does increase, namely winner
determination for Kemeny elections.

processing tasks, the problem of separating simultaneous speakers in a mixture
remains challenging. Two major difficulties in such systems are the arbitrary
source permutation and unknown number of sources in the mixture. We propose a
novel deep learning framework for single channel speech separation by creating
attractor points in high dimensional embedding space of the acoustic signals
which pull together the time-frequency bins corresponding to each source.
Attractor points in this study are created by finding the centroids of the
sources in the embedding space, which are subsequently used to determine the
similarity of each bin in the mixture to each source. The network is then
trained to minimize the reconstruction error of each source by optimizing the
embeddings. The proposed model is different from prior works in that it
implements an end-to-end training, and it does not depend on the number of
sources in the mixture. Two strategies are explored in the test time, K-means
and fixed attractor points, where the latter requires no post-processing and
can be implemented in real-time. We evaluated our system on Wall Street Journal
dataset and show 5.49\% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art methods.

performing two different computations for the variation of the Einstein-Hilbert

all other nodes. We study deterministic algorithms for this fundamental
communication task in a very weak model of wireless communication. The only
signals sent by nodes are beeps. Moreover, they are delivered to neighbors of
the beeping node in an asynchronous way: the time between sending and reception
is finite but unpredictable. We first observe that under this scenario, no
communication is possible, if beeps are all of the same strength. Hence we
study broadcasting in the bivalent beeping model, where every beep can be
either soft or loud. At the receiving end, if exactly one soft beep is received
by a node in a round, it is heard as soft. Any other combination of beeps
received in a round is heard as a loud beep. The cost of a broadcasting
algorithm is the total number of beeps sent by all nodes.
  We consider four levels of knowledge that nodes may have about the network:
anonymity (no knowledge whatsoever), ad-hoc (all nodes have distinct labels and
every node knows only its own label), neighborhood awareness (every node knows
its label and labels of all neighbors), and full knowledge (every node knows
the entire labeled map of the network and the identity of the source). We first
show that in the anonymous case, broadcasting is impossible even for very
simple networks. For each of the other three knowledge levels we provide upper
and lower bounds on the minimum cost of a broadcasting algorithm. Our results
show separations between all these scenarios. Perhaps surprisingly, the jump in
broadcasting cost between the ad-hoc and neighborhood awareness levels is much
larger than between the neighborhood awareness and full knowledge levels,
although in the two former levels knowledge of nodes is local, and in the
latter it is global.

Nd-Fe-B magnets using first-principles results show that a 3-4% local strain in
a 2-nm-wide region near the interface around the grain boundaries and triple

~60%. The local ab biaxial stress state is more likely to induce a large loss
of coercivity. In addition to the local stress states and strain levels
themselves, the shape of the interfaces and the intergranular phases also makes
a difference in determining the coercivity. Smoothing the edge and reducing the

decision processes (MDPs). In this thesis we go beyond MDPs and consider RL in
environments that are non-Markovian, non-ergodic and only partially observable.
Our focus is not on practical algorithms, but rather on the fundamental
underlying problems: How do we balance exploration and exploitation? How do we
explore optimally? When is an agent optimal? We follow the nonparametric
realizable paradigm.
  We establish negative results on Bayesian RL agents, in particular AIXI. We
show that unlucky or adversarial choices of the prior cause the agent to
misbehave drastically. Therefore Legg-Hutter intelligence and balanced Pareto
optimality, which depend crucially on the choice of the prior, are entirely
subjective. Moreover, in the class of all computable environments every policy
is Pareto optimal. This undermines all existing optimality properties for AIXI.
However, there are Bayesian approaches to general RL that satisfy objective
optimality guarantees: We prove that Thompson sampling is asymptotically
optimal in stochastic environments in the sense that its value converges to the
value of the optimal policy. We connect asymptotic optimality to regret given a
recoverability assumption on the environment that allows the agent to recover
from mistakes. Hence Thompson sampling achieves sublinear regret in these
environments.
  Our results culminate in a formal solution to the grain of truth problem: A
Bayesian agent acting in a multi-agent environment learns to predict the other
agents' policies if its prior assigns positive probability to them (the prior
contains a grain of truth). We construct a large but limit computable class
containing a grain of truth and show that agents based on Thompson sampling
over this class converge to play Nash equilibria in arbitrary unknown
computable multi-agent environments.

these two complexity measures are incomparable. As classical information
complexity is an upper bound on quantum information complexity, which in turn
is equal to amortized quantum communication complexity, our work implies that a
tight direct sum result for distributional quantum communication complexity
cannot hold. The function we use to present such a separation is the Symmetric
k-ary Pointer Jumping function introduced by Rao and Sinha [ECCC TR15-057],
whose classical communication complexity is exponentially larger than its
classical information complexity. In this paper, we show that the quantum
communication complexity of this function is polynomially equivalent to its

clarifies certain obscure parts of their argument by reinterpreting it as a
statement about brane configurations in flat space. In that context the
statement is that stable non-supersymmetric configurations of branes are
characterized by charges in the torsion subgroup of K-theory and their only
long range fields are gravitational and scalar. The field equations do not have
large radius near horizon AdS solutions. Instead the horizons are Schwarzschild
black branes. This leads us to conjecture that for $d \leq 11$ the K theory
charges are bounded by a small integer, and there can be no large gravitational
back reaction in the near horizon limit, for stable configurations. Unbounded
values of these discrete charges would violate the Covariant Entropy Bound. We
discuss a counterexample to the conjecture in $AdS_3$. We find similar

performs spectral analysis on large sensitive data stored in the form of
matrices. In this paper, we study differentially private low-rank factorization
of a matrix with respect to the spectral norm in the turnstile update model. In
this problem, given an input matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$
updated in the turnstile manner and a target rank $k$, the goal is to find two
rank-$k$ orthogonal matrices $\mathbf{U}_k \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k}$ and
$\mathbf{V}_k \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$, and one positive semidefinite
diagonal matrix $\textbf{\Sigma}_k \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times k}$ such that
$\mathbf{A} \approx \mathbf{U}_k \textbf{\Sigma}_k \mathbf{V}_k^\mathsf{T}$
with respect to the spectral norm.
  Our main contributions are two computationally efficient and sub-linear space
algorithms for computing a differentially private low-rank factorization. We
consider two levels of privacy. In the first level of privacy, we consider two
matrices neighboring if their difference has a Frobenius norm at most $1$. In
the second level of privacy, we consider two matrices as neighboring if their
difference can be represented as an outer product of two unit vectors. Both
these privacy levels are stronger than those studied in the earlier papers such
as Dwork {\it et al.} (STOC 2014), Hardt and Roth (STOC 2013), and Hardt and
Price (NIPS 2014).
  As a corollary to our results, we get non-private algorithms that compute
low-rank factorization in the turnstile update model with respect to the
spectral norm. We note that, prior to this work, no algorithm that outputs
low-rank factorization with respect to the spectral norm in the turnstile
update model was known; i.e., our algorithm gives the first non-private
low-rank factorization with respect to the spectral norm in the turnstile

dichalcogenide 1T-TaS2 represents another intriguing example, in which the Mott
insulator phase is intimately entangled with a series of complex

found that 1T-TaS2 undergoes a Mott-insulator-to-superconductor transition
induced by high pressure, charge doping, or isovalent substitution. The nature
of the Mott insulator phase and transition mechanism to the conducting state is
still under heated debate. Here, by combining scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) measurements and first-principles calculations, we investigate the atomic
scale electronic structure of 1T-TaS2 Mott insulator and its evolution to the
metallic state upon isovalent substitution of S with Se. We identify two
distinct types of orbital textures - one localized and the other extended - and
demonstrates that the interplay between them is the key factor that determines
the electronic structure. Especially, we show that the continuous evolution of
the charge gap visualized by STM is due to the immersion of the
localized-orbital-induced Hubbard bands into the extended-orbital-spanned Fermi
sea, featuring a unique evolution from a Mott gap to a charge-transfer gap.
This new mechanism of orbital-driven Mottness collapse revealed here suggests
an interesting route for creating novel electronic state and designing future

modelling of the system by Abbott et al. (2016a) supposes that the formation of
black holes with such large masses from the evolution of single massive stars
is only feasible if the wind mass-loss rates of the progenitors were greatly
reduced relative to the mass-loss rates of massive stars in the Galaxy,
concluding that heavy BHs must form in low-metallicity (Z < 0.25-0.5 Zsun)
environments. However, strong surface magnetic fields also provide a powerful
mechanism for modifying mass loss and rotation of massive stars, independent of
environmental metallicity (ud-Doula & Owocki 2002; ud-Doula et al. 2008). In
this paper we explore the hypothesis that some heavy BHs, with masses >25 Msun
such as those inferred to compose GW150914, could be the natural end-point of
evolution of magnetic massive stars in a solar-metallicity environment. Using
the MESA code, we developed a new grid of single, non-rotating, solar
metallicity evolutionary models for initial ZAMS masses from 40-80 Msun that
include, for the first time, the quenching of the mass loss due to a realistic
dipolar surface magnetic field. The new models predict TAMS masses that are
significantly greater than those from equivalent non-magnetic models, reducing
the total mass lost by a strongly magnetized 80 Msun star during its main
sequence evolution by 20 Msun. This corresponds approximately to the mass loss
reduction expected from an environment with metallicity Z = 1/30 Zsun.

viscous fingering are often driven by instabilities. Accordingly, the resulting
growth patterns are usually highly branched, fractal structures. However, in
some of the unstable growth processes the envelope of the structure grows in a
highly regular manner, with the perturbations smoothed out over the course of
time. In this paper, we show that the regularity of the envelope growth can be
connected to small-scale instabilities leading to the tip splitting of the
fingers at the advancing front of the structure. Whenever the growth velocity
becomes too large, the finger splits into two branches. In this way it can
absorb an increased flux and thus damp the instability. Hence, somewhat
counterintuitively, the instability at a small scale results in a stability at
a larger scale. The quantitative analysis of these effects is provided by means
of the Loewner equation, which one can use to reduce the problem of the
interface motion to that of the evolution of the conformal mapping onto the
complex plane. This allows an effective analysis of the multifingered growth in
a variety of different geometries. We show how the geometry impacts the shape
of the envelope of the growing pattern and compare the results with those

Ba$_{3}$(Mn$_{1-x}$V$_{x}$)$_{2}$O$_{8}$, where nonmagnetic V$^{5+}$ ions
partially substitute magnetic Mn$^{5+}$ ions. This substitution results in
unpaired $S=1$ moments for half-substituted dimers, which are ungapped and
therefore susceptible to types of magnetic order not present in the parent
compound. AC susceptibility measurements of compositions between $x=0.046$ and
$x=0.84$ show a sharp frequency- and composition-dependent kink at temperatures
below 210mK, suggesting that unpaired spins form a spin glass. The case for a
glassy state is made clearer by the absence of any sharp features in the
specific heat. However, Ba$_{3}$(Mn$_{1-x}$V$_{x}$)$_{2}$O$_{8}$ is not a
paradigmatic spin glass. Whereas both the freezing temperature and the Weiss
temperature (determined from susceptibility above 1K) vary strongly as a
function of composition, the heat capacity per unpaired spin is found to be
insensitive (above the glass transition) to the density of unpaired spins for
the broad regime $0.18\leq x \leq 0.84$. This surprising result is consistent
with a scenario in which nearest-neighbor unpaired spins form local, possibly
fluctuating, spin-singlets prior to the eventual spin freezing. The spin glass

symmetric iterative methods for solving systems of algebraic equations
resulting from the finite element approximation. The stopping criterion
consists of the evaluations of the discretization and the algebraic error
estimators, that are based on the respective duality error estimator and the
difference of two consecutive iterates. Iterations are terminated when the
algebraic estimator is of the same magnitude as the discretization estimator.
Numerical results for multigrid $V(1,1)$-cycle and symmetric Gauss-Seidel
iterative methods are presented for the linear finite element approximation to
the Poisson equations. A large reduction in computational cost is observed
compared to the standard residual-based stopping criterion.

collisional ring galaxy, VII Zw466, using the Redshift Search Receiver
instrument on the Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano.The apparent
molecular-to-atomic gas ratio either places the ISM of VII Zw466 in the
HI-dominated regime or implies a large quantity of CO-dark molecular gas, given
its high star formation rate. The molecular gas densities and star formation
rate densities of VII Zw466 are consistent with the standard Kennicutt-Schmidt
star formation law even though we find this galaxy to be H2-deficient. The
choice of CO-to-H2 conversion factors cannot explain the apparent H2 deficiency
in its entirety. Hence, we find that the collisional ring galaxy, VII Zw466, is
either largely deficient in both H2 and HI or contains a large mass of CO-dark
gas. A low molecular gas fraction could be due to the enhancement of feedback
processes from previous episodes of star formation as a result of the
star-forming ISM being confined to the ring. We conclude that collisional ring
galaxy formation is an extreme form of galaxy interaction that triggers a
strong galactic-wide burst of star formation that may provide immediate
negative feedback towards subsequent episodes of star formation---resulting in
a short-lived star formation history or, at least, the appearance of a
molecular gas deficit.

that the localized energy released in antibaryon-baryon annihilation is
deposited in a nucleus mainly via pion-nucleon collisions, which leads to the
emissions of pre-equilibrium particles, fission, evaporation of nucleons and

car following model, as it determines the vehicle flow as vehicles accelerate
from standstill or decelerate because of the obstacle ahead. The other factor
significantly affecting the intersection throughput is the maximal vehicle
acceleration rate.
  In this paper, we analyze three car following behaviors: Gipps model,
Improved Intelligent Driver Model (IIDM) and Helly model. Gipps model exhibits
rather aggressive acceleration behavior. If used for the intersection
throughput estimation, this model would lead to overly optimistic results.
Helly model is convenient to analyze due to its linear nature, but its
deceleration behavior in the presence of obstacles ahead is unrealistically
abrupt. Showing the most realistic acceleration and deceleration behavior of
the three models, IIDM is suited for ACC/CACC impact evaluation better than the
other two.
  We discuss the influence of the maximal vehicle acceleration rate and
presence of different portions of ACC/CACC vehicles on intersection throughput
in the context of the three car following models. The analysis is done for two
cases: (1) free road downstream of the intersection; and (2) red light at some
distance downstream of the intersection.

recognition in recent years because of its extraordinary ability in learning
discriminative features of people with different identities. To train such a
well-designed deep network, tremendous amounts of data is indispensable. Long
tail distribution specifically refers to the fact that a small number of
generic entities appear frequently while other objects far less existing.
Considering the existence of long tail distribution of the real world data,
large but uniform distributed data are usually hard to retrieve. Empirical
experiences and analysis show that classes with more samples will pose greater
impact on the feature learning process and inversely cripple the whole models
feature extracting ability on tail part data. Contrary to most of the existing
works that alleviate this problem by simply cutting the tailed data for uniform
distributions across the classes, this paper proposes a new loss function
called range loss to effectively utilize the whole long tailed data in training
process. More specifically, range loss is designed to reduce overall
intra-personal variations while enlarging inter-personal differences within one
mini-batch simultaneously when facing even extremely unbalanced data. The
optimization objective of range loss is the $k$ greatest range's harmonic mean
values in one class and the shortest inter-class distance within one batch.
Extensive experiments on two famous and challenging face recognition benchmarks
(Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) and YouTube Faces (YTF) not only demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach in overcoming the long tail effect

studies. However, there is not any benchmark to measure the sparsity of image
patch/group because sparse discriminant conditions cannot keep unchanged. This
paper analyzes the sparsity of group based on the strategy of the rank
minimization. Firstly, an adaptive dictionary for each group is designed. Then,
we prove that group-based sparse coding is equivalent to the rank minimization
problem, and thus the sparse coefficient of each group is measured by
estimating the singular values of each group. Based on that measurement, the
weighted Schatten $p$-norm minimization (WSNM) has been found to be the closest
solution to the real singular values of each group. Thus, WSNM can be
equivalently transformed into a non-convex $\ell_p$-norm minimization problem
in group-based sparse coding. To make the proposed scheme tractable and robust,
the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used to solve the
$\ell_p$-norm minimization problem. Experimental results on two applications:
image inpainting and image compressive sensing (CS) recovery have shown that
the proposed scheme outperforms many state-of-the-art methods.

an ordinary Newtonian particle. In this paper, we derive the effective dynamics
of a type-I Wigner crystal of composite particles directly from its microscopic
wave function. It indicates that the composite particles are subjected to a
Berry curvature in the momentum space as well as an emergent dissipationless
viscosity. Therefore, contrary to the general belief, composite particles
follow the more general Sundaram-Niu dynamics instead of the ordinary Newtonian
one. We show that the presence of the Berry curvature is an inevitable feature
for a dynamics consistent with the dipole picture of composite particles and
Kohn's theorem. Based on the dynamics, we determine the dispersions of
magneto-phonon excitations numerically. We find an emergent magneto-roton mode
which signifies the composite-particle nature of the Wigner crystal. It occurs
at frequencies much lower than the magnetic cyclotron frequency and has a
vanishing oscillator strength in the long wavelength limit.

prediction tasks including semantic segmentation. In this paper, we start from
discussing FCN by understanding its architecture limitations in building a
strong segmentation network. Next, we present our Improved Fully Convolution
Network (IFCN). In contrast to FCN, IFCN introduces a context network that
progressively expands the receptive fields of feature maps. In addition, dense
skip connections are added so that the context network can be effectively
optimized. More importantly, these dense skip connections enable IFCN to fuse
rich-scale context to make reliable predictions. Empirically, those
architecture modifications are proven to be significant to enhance the
segmentation performance. Without engaging any contextual post-processing, IFCN
significantly advances the state-of-the-arts on ADE20K (ImageNet scene

in terms of quantity and coverage because human annotation is labor-intensive,

basic idea is to cast error detection as a binary classification problem and

proposed approach significantly outperforms SVMs and convolutional networks

a recently developed Frontal-Delaunay refinement technique, a method for the

hill-climbing type optimisation techniques. Overall, the algorithm is shown to
produce grids with very high element quality and smooth grading
characteristics, while imposing relatively low computational expense. A
selection of uniform and non-uniform spheroidal grids appropriate for
high-resolution, multi-scale general circulation modelling are presented. These
grids are shown to satisfy the geometric constraints associated with

significant limitation to increasing the optical power is the phenomenon of
three-mode parametric instabilities, in which the laser field in the arm
cavities is scattered into higher order optical modes by acoustic modes of the
cavity mirrors. The optical modes can further drive the acoustic modes via
radiation pressure, potentially producing an exponential buildup. One proposed
technique to stabilize parametric instability is active damping of acoustic
modes. We report here the first demonstration of damping a parametrically
unstable mode using active feedback forces on the cavity mirror. A 15,538 Hz
mode that grew exponentially with a time constant of 182 sec was damped using
electro-static actuation, with a resulting decay time constant of 23 sec. An
average control force of 0.03 nNrms was required to maintain the acoustic mode

There
are three kinds of special structures, namely shoulders, logarithmically

the optical excitations of the extreme points, saddle points and
constant-energy loops. With the increasing field strength, two splitting
shoulder structures, which are dominated by the parabolic bands of ${5p_z}$
orbitals, come to exist because of the spin-split energy bands. The frequency
of threshold shoulder declines to zero and then linearly grows. The third
shoulder at ${0.75 \sim 0.85}$ eV mainly comes from (${5p_x,5p_y}$) orbitals.
The former and the latter orbitals, respectively, create the saddle-point
symmetric peaks near the M point, while they hybridize with one another to
generate the loop-related asymmetric peaks. Tinene quite differs from graphene,
silicene, and germanene. The special relationship among the multi-orbital

counting via accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) offers opportunities for
precise measurements of neutron capture cross sections, e.g. for nuclear
astrophysics. The technique represents a truly complementary approach,
completely independent of previous experimental methods. The potential of this
technique is highlighted at the example of the $^{54}$Fe($n, \gamma$)$^{55}$Fe
reaction. Following a series of irradiations with neutrons from cold and
thermal to keV energies, the produced long-lived $^{55}$Fe nuclei
($t_{1/2}=2.744(9)$ yr) were analyzed at the Vienna Environmental Research
Accelerator (VERA). A reproducibility of about 1% could be achieved for the
detection of $^{55}$Fe, yielding cross section uncertainties of less than 3%.
Thus, the new data can serve as anchor points to time-of-flight experiments. We
report significantly improved neutron capture cross sections at thermal energy
($\sigma_{th}=2.30\pm0.07$ b) as well as for a quasi-Maxwellian spectrum of
$kT=25$ keV ($\sigma=30.3\pm1.2$ mb) and for $E_n=481\pm53$ keV ($\sigma=
6.01\pm0.23$ mb). The new experimental cross sections have been used to deduce
improved Maxwellian average cross sections in the temperature regime of the
common $s$-process scenarios. The astrophysical impact is discussed using
stellar models for low-mass AGB stars.

applications such as agriculture and mining, and allow per-pixel thematic
classification of materials in a scene based on their unique spectral
signatures. Recently, convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable
performance for classification tasks, but require substantial amounts of
labelled training data. This data must sufficiently cover the variability
expected to be encountered in the environment. For hyperspectral data, one of
the main variations encountered outdoors is due to incident illumination, which
can change in spectral shape and intensity depending on the scene geometry. For
example, regions occluded from the sun have a lower intensity and their
incident irradiance skewed towards shorter wavelengths.
  In this work, a data augmentation strategy based on relighting is used during
training of a hyperspectral convolutional neural network. It allows training to
occur in the outdoor environment given only a small labelled region, which does
not need to sufficiently represent the geometric variability of the entire
scene. This is important for applications where obtaining large amounts of
training data is labourious, hazardous or difficult, such as labelling pixels
within shadows. Radiometric normalisation approaches for pre-processing the
hyperspectral data are analysed and it is shown that methods based on the raw
pixel data are sufficient to be used as input for the classifier. This removes
the need for external hardware such as calibration boards, which can restrict
the application of hyperspectral sensors in robotics applications. Experiments
to evaluate the classification system are carried out on two datasets captured
from a field-based platform.

legal vehicle by RSU, we adopt deniable group key agreement method to
negotiation session key (sk) and use it to transmit GK between RSU. In
addition, vehicles not only broadcast messages to other vehicles, but also
communicate with other members in the same group. So group communication is
necessary in VANET. Finally, the security and performance analysis shown that
our scheme is security, meanwhile the verification delay, transmission

pose. For the first step, we use a recent CNN-based detector. For the second
step, most existing approaches perform 2$N$-to-3$N$ regression of the Cartesian
joint coordinates. We show that more precise pose estimates can be obtained by
representing both the 2D and 3D human poses using $N\times N$ distance
matrices, and formulating the problem as a 2D-to-3D distance matrix regression.
For learning such a regressor we leverage on simple Neural Network
architectures, which by construction, enforce positivity and symmetry of the
predicted matrices. The approach has also the advantage to naturally handle
missing observations and allowing to hypothesize the position of non-observed
joints. Quantitative results on Humaneva and Human3.6M datasets demonstrate
consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art. Qualitative evaluation on
the images in-the-wild of the LSP dataset, using the regressor learned on

other efficient approaches would sacrifice path flexibility (e.g., DEFO). To
implement SR efficiently and flexibly, PACO presents each path as a

concatenate paths with minimum path labels. Our extensive simulations confirm
the scalability of PACO as it saves the flow table overhead up to 94% compared
with OpenFlow-SDN solutions and show that PACO outperforms SR-SDN solutions by
supporting more than 40% paths with few label overhead.

important for fault analysis and debugging of formal specifications of security
protocols, programs and terminological definitions. This paper discusses
several ways of enhancing the paradigm of bottom-up model generation. The two
main contributions are new, generalized blocking techniques and a new
range-restriction transformation. The blocking techniques are based on simple
transformations of the input set together with standard equality reasoning and
redundancy elimination techniques. These provide general methods for finding
small, finite models. The range-restriction transformation refines existing
transformations to range-restricted clauses by carefully limiting the creation
of domain terms. All possible combinations of the introduced techniques and
classical range-restriction were tested on the clausal problems of the TPTP
Version 6.0.0 with an implementation based on the SPASS theorem prover using a
hyperresolution-like refinement. Unrestricted domain blocking gave best results
for satisfiable problems showing it is a powerful technique indispensable for
bottom-up model generation methods. Both in combination with the new
range-restricting transformation, and the classical range-restricting
transformation, good results have been obtained. Limiting the creation of terms
during the inference process by using the new range restricting transformation
has paid off, especially when using it together with a shifting transformation.
The experimental results also show that classical range restriction with
unrestricted blocking provides a useful complementary method. Overall, the
results showed bottom-up model generation methods were good for disproving
theorems and generating models for satisfiable problems, but less efficient
than SPASS in auto mode for unsatisfiable problems.

behaviours of stellar populations of the Milky Way's bulge. We first show, by
means of pure N-body simulations, that initially co-spatial stellar populations
with different in-plane random motions separate when a bar forms. The radially
cooler populations form a strong bar, and are vertically thin and
peanut-shaped, while the hotter populations form a weaker bar and become a
vertically thicker box. We demonstrate that it is the radial, not the vertical,
velocity dispersion that dominates this evolution. Assuming that early stellar
discs heat rapidly as they form, then both the in-plane and vertical random
motions correlate with stellar age and chemistry, leading to different density
distributions for metal-rich and metal-poor stars. We then use a
high-resolution simulation, in which all stars form out of gas, to demonstrate
that this is what happens. When we apply these results to the Milky Way we show
that a very broad range of observed trends for ages, densities, kinematics and
chemistries, that have been presented as evidence for contradictory paths to
the formation of the bulge, are in fact consistent with a bulge which formed
from a continuum of disc stellar populations which were kinematically separated
by the bar. For the first time we are able to account for the bulge's main
trends via a model in which the bulge formed largely in situ. Since the model
is generic, we also predict the general appearance of stellar population maps
of external edge-on galaxies.

synaptic-coupling type, we consider two types of excitatory and inhibitory
synchronization (i.e., synchronization via synaptic excitation and inhibition)
in complex small-world networks of excitatory regular spiking (RS) pyramidal
neurons and inhibitory fast spiking (FS) interneurons. For both cases of
excitatory and inhibitory synchronization, effects of synaptic couplings on
dynamical responses to external time-periodic stimuli $S(t)$ (applied to a
fraction of neurons) are investigated by varying the driving amplitude $A$ of
$S(t)$. Stimulated neurons are phase-locked to external stimuli for both cases
of excitatory and inhibitory couplings. On the other hand, the stimulation
effect on non-stimulated neurons depends on the type of synaptic coupling. The
external stimulus $S(t)$ makes a constructive effect on excitatory
non-stimulated RS neurons (i.e., it causes external phase lockings in the
non-stimulated sub-population), while $S(t)$ makes a destructive effect on
inhibitory non-stimulated FS interneurons (i.e., it breaks up original
inhibitory synchronization in the non-stimulated sub-population). As results of
these different effects of $S(t)$, the type and degree of dynamical response
(e.g., synchronization enhancement or suppression), characterized by the
dynamical response factor $D_f$ (given by the ratio of synchronization degree

our key idea is to exploit the analytics on the high regularity of the spatial

characterize the stylized patches by their normalized positions and the optimal
scales to depict their style elements. Our method first estimates these two
features and derives their correlation statistically. They are then converted
into soft constraints for texture transfer to accomplish adaptive multi-scale
texture synthesis and to make style element distribution uniform. It allows our
algorithm to produce artistic typography that fits for both local texture
patterns and the global spatial distribution in the example. Experimental
results demonstrate the superiority of our method for various text effects over
conventional style transfer methods. In addition, we validate the effectiveness

reasons for ruling out real Hilbert spaces relying on Heisenberg principle.
Focusing on this issue from another viewpoint, we argue that there is a
fundamental reason why elementary quantum systems are not described in real
Hilbert spaces: their symmetry group. We consider an elementary relativistic
system within Wigner's approach defined as a locally-faithful irreducible
continuous unitary representation of the Poincar\'e group in a real Hilbert
space. We prove that, if the squared-mass operator is non-negative, the system
admits a natural, Poincar\'e invariant and unique up to sign, complex structure
which commutes with the whole algebra of observables generated by the
representation. All that leads to a physically equivalent formulation in a
complex Hilbert space. Differently from what happens in the real picture, here
all selfadjoint operators are observables in accordance with Sol\`er's thesis,
and the standard quantum version of Noether theorem holds. We next focus on the
physical hypotheses adopted to define a quantum elementary relativistic system
relaxing them and making our model physically more general. We use a physically
more accurate notion of irreducibility regarding the algebra of observables
only, we describe the symmetries in terms of automorphisms of the restricted
lattice of elementary propositions and we adopt a notion of continuity referred
to the states. Also in this case, the final result proves that there exist a
unique (up to sign) Poincar\'e invariant complex structure making the theory
complex and completely fitting into Sol\`er's picture. This complex structure
reveals a nice interplay of Poincar\'e symmetry and the classification of the
commutant of irreducible real von Neumann algebras.

calculated energy intake functions of ectotherms and endotherms derived from

comes in two equivalent formulations, a differential and an integral one. It is
derived from a discrete level approach, and it is shown to be well-posed and to
attain a unique solution for (almost) every parameter set. Numerically, the
integral formulation of the model is considered as an inverse problem with

major problem in the video domain is the lack of sufficient labeled data for
learning to model temporal information. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised temporal modeling method that learns from untrimmed videos. The
speed of motion varies constantly, e.g., a man may run quickly or slowly. We
therefore train a Multirate Visual Recurrent Model (MVRM) by encoding frames of
a clip with different intervals. This learning process makes the learned model
more capable of dealing with motion speed variance. Given a clip sampled from a
video, we use its past and future neighboring clips as the temporal context,
and reconstruct the two temporal transitions, i.e., present$\rightarrow$past
transition and present$\rightarrow$future transition, reflecting the temporal
information in different views. The proposed method exploits the two
transitions simultaneously by incorporating a bidirectional reconstruction
which consists of a backward reconstruction and a forward reconstruction. We
apply the proposed method to two challenging video tasks, i.e., complex event
detection and video captioning, in which it achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, our method generates the best single feature for event
detection with a relative improvement of 10.4% on the MEDTest-13 dataset and

quantum field theory, the Abelian duality for quantum field theory on globally
hyperbolic spacetime with compact Cauchy surface is tackled. Fistly, the
algebra of observables is constructed. It is shown that it can be presented as
the direct sum of three pre-symplectic Abelian groups, each corresponding to a
different sector of the theory. As a consequence, it is possible to provide
quantum states for the theory by building separate states on each direct
summand. In particular, explicit examples in two and four dimensions are
discussed thoroughly; a ground Hadamard state in a suitable sense is proved to
exist for both of them. Lastly, it is shown that the Abelian duality is

extends Bayesian multivariate disease mapping models to analyse multivariate

race conditions is complex. Preserving these properties when applications are
updated at runtime is even harder. We present a choreographic approach for
programming updatable, distributed applications. We define a choreography
language, called Dynamic Interaction-Oriented Choreography (AIOC), that allows
the programmer to specify, from a global viewpoint, which parts of the
application can be updated. At runtime, these parts may be replaced by new AIOC
fragments from outside the application. AIOC programs are compiled, generating
code for each participant in a process-level language called Dynamic
Process-Oriented Choreographies (APOC). We prove that APOC distributed
applications generated from AIOC specifications are deadlock free and race free
and that these properties hold also after any runtime update. We instantiate
the theoretical model above into a programming framework called Adaptable
Interaction-Oriented Choreographies in Jolie (AIOCJ) that comprises an
integrated development environment, a compiler from an extension of AIOCs to
distributed Jolie programs, and a runtime environment to support their
execution.

planetary wave (PW) activity in the mesosphere-lower thermosphere (MLT). PW
activity near 95 km is derived from meteor wind data using a chain of eight
SuperDARN radars at high northern latitudes that span longitudes from
150$^{\circ}$ W to 25$^{\circ}$ E and latitudes from 51 to 66$^{\circ}$ N.
Zonal wave number 1 and 2 components were extracted from the meridional wind
for the years 2000-2008. The observed wintertime PW activity shows common
features associated with the stratospheric wind reversals and the accompanying
stratospheric warming events. Onset dates for seven SSW events accompanied by
an elevated stratopause (ES) were identified during this time period using the
Specified Dynamics Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM). For the
seven events, a significant enhancement in wave number 1 and 2 PW amplitudes
near 95 km was found to occur after the wind reversed at 50 km, with amplitudes
maximizing approximately 5 days after the onset of the wind reversal. This PW
enhancement in the MLT after the event was confirmed using SD-WACCM. When all
cases of polar cap wind reversals at 50 km were considered, a significant,
albeit moderate, correlation of 0.4 was found between PW amplitudes near 95 km
and westward polar-cap stratospheric winds at 50 km, with the maximum
correlation occurring $\sim$ 3 days after the maximum westward wind. These
results indicate that the enhancement of PW amplitudes near 95 km is a common
feature of SSWs irrespective of the strength of the wind reversal.

atmospheric habitable zone (AHZ), with temperatures that could support
Earth-centric life, which sits above an environment that does not support life.
To illustrate our model we use a cool Y dwarf atmosphere, such as
$\mathrm{WISE~J}085510.83-0714442.5$ whose $4.5-5.2$ micron spectrum shows
absorption features consistent with water vapour and clouds. We allow organisms
to adapt to their atmospheric environment (described by temperature,
convection, and gravity) by adopting different growth strategies that maximize
their chance of survival and proliferation. We assume a constant upward
vertical velocity through the AHZ. We found that the organism growth strategy
is most sensitive to the magnitude of the atmospheric convection. Stronger
convection supports the evolution of more massive organisms. For a purely
radiative environment we find that evolved organisms have a mass that is an
order of magnitude smaller than terrestrial microbes, thereby defining a
dynamical constraint on the dimensions of life that an AHZ can support. Based
on a previously defined statistical approach we infer that there are of order
$10^9$ cool Y brown dwarfs in the Milky Way, and likely a few tens of these
objects are within ten parsecs from Earth. Our work also has implications for
exploring life in the atmospheres of temperate gas giants. Consideration of the
habitable volumes in planetary atmospheres significantly increases the volume

contact angles that imply a large amount of adhesion. Here, we investigate the

for various applications in video surveillance. Background modeling methods
have become increasing efficient in robustly modeling the background and hence
detecting moving objects in any visual scene. Although several background
subtraction and foreground detection have been proposed recently, no
traditional algorithm today still seem to be able to simultaneously address all
the key challenges of illumination variation, dynamic camera motion, cluttered
background and occlusion. This limitation can be attributed to the lack of
systematic investigation concerning the role and importance of features within
background modeling and foreground detection. With the availability of a rather
large set of invariant features, the challenge is in determining the best
combination of features that would improve accuracy and robustness in
detection. The purpose of this study is to initiate a rigorous and
comprehensive survey of features used within background modeling and foreground
detection. Further, this paper presents a systematic experimental and
statistical analysis of techniques that provide valuable insight on the trends
in background modeling and use it to draw meaningful recommendations for
practitioners. In this paper, a preliminary review of the key characteristics
of features based on the types and sizes is provided in addition to
investigating their intrinsic spectral, spatial and temporal properties.
Furthermore, improvements using statistical and fuzzy tools are examined and
techniques based on multiple features are benchmarked against reliability and

electron spin resonance. Two different types of two-qubit operations are
presented for the exchange-only and the RX qubit which can be divided into
short-ranged and long-ranged interactions. Both of these interaction types can
be expected to be necessary in a large-scale quantum computer. We also take
into account the decoherence of the qubit through the influence of magnetic
noise as well as dephasing due to charge noise.

increasingly of interest in a multiplex network setting. Here we show how the
Master Stability Function, a celebrated framework for analyzing synchronization

master stability equations that determine respectively the necessary regions of
complete synchronization, intra-layer synchronization and inter-layer
synchronization. We calculate these three regions explicitly for the case of a
two-layer network of R{\""o}ssler oscillators and show that the overlap of the
regions determines the type of synchronization achieved. In particular, if the
inter- or intra-layer coupling function is such that the inter-layer or
intra-layer synchronization region is empty, complete synchronization cannot be
achieved regardless of the coupling strength. Furthermore, for any given nodal
dynamics and network structure, the occurrence of intra-layer and inter-layer
synchronization depend mainly on the coupling functions of nodes within a layer

intra- and inter-layer supra-Laplacians commute. But we show this is only a
sufficient, and not necessary, condition and that the results can be applied

building upon the phenomenological scenario of Babcock(1961). Here we present a
modification and extension of Leighton's model. Using the axisymmetric
component of the magnetic field, we consider the radial field component at the
solar surface and the radially integrated toroidal magnetic flux in the
convection zone, both as functions of latitude. No assumptions are made with
regard to the radial location of the toroidal flux. The model includes the
effects of turbulent diffusion at the surface and in the convection zone,
poleward meridional flow at the surface and an equatorward return flow
affecting the toroidal flux, latitudinal differential rotation and the
near-surface layer of radial rotational shear, downward convective pumping of
magnetic flux in the shear layer, and flux emergence in the form of tilted
bipolar magnetic regions. While the parameters relevant for the transport of
the surface field are taken from observations, the model condenses the unknown
properties of magnetic field and flow in the convection zone into a few free
parameters (turbulent diffusivity, effective return flow, amplitude of the
source term, and a parameter describing the effective radial shear). Comparison
with the results of two-dimensional flux transport dynamo codes shows that the
model captures the essential features of these simulations. We carry out a
parameter study over the four-dimensional parameter space and identify the
parameter ranges that provide solar-like solutions. Dipole parity is always
preferred and solutions with periods around 22 years and a correct phase
difference between flux emergence in low latitudes and the strength of the
polar fields are found for a return flow speed around 2~m/s, turbulent
diffusivity <80~km^2/s, and dynamo excitation not too far above the threshold

from this supernova remnant and the molecular gas. Different from the
background, which is produced by the ensemble of large amount of sources in the
Milky Way, the local injected spectrum can be harder. The time-dependent
transport of particles would make the propagated spectrum even harder. Under
this scenario, the anomalies of both primary ($\rm p$, $\rm e^-$) and secondary

further show that the TeV to sub-PeV anisotropy of proton is consistent with
the observations if the local source is relatively young and lying at the

designed for detecting cosmic ray (CR) electrons, $\gamma$-rays up to tens of
TeV and CR nuclei from proton to iron up to several PeV. The main instrument of
HERD is a 3-D imaging calorimeter (CALO) composed of nearly ten thousand cubic
LYSO crystals. A large dynamic range of single HERD CALO Cell (HCC) is
necessary to achieve HERD's PeV observation objectives, which means that the
response of HCC should maintain a good linearity from minimum ionizing particle
(MIP) calibration to PeV shower maximum. In order to study the linearity of HCC
over such a large energy range, a beam test has been implemented at the E2 and
E3 beam lines of BEPC. High intensity pulsed electron beam provided by E2 line
are used for producing high energy density within HCC; $\pi^{+}$/proton
provided by E3 line are used for HCC calibration. The results show that no
saturation effect occurs and the linearity of HCC is better than 10% from 30
MeV (1 MIP) to 1.1$\times$10$^{3}$ TeV (energy density is 93 TeV/cm$^{3}$),
which can meet the requirement mentioned above.

fermion-antifermion scattering amplitude every term in an expansion to
arbitrary order in $g$ is found to diverge as just a single ultraviolet
logarithm (i.e. no log squared or higher), and is thus made finite by a single
subtraction. While not necessary for renormalizability per se, the reduction in
the dimension of $\bar{\psi}\psi$ to two leads to dynamical chiral symmetry
breaking in the infrared, with the needed subtraction then automatically being
provided by the theory itself through the symmetry breaking mechanism, with
there then being no need to introduce the subtraction by hand. Since the vector

constraints on the mass of and distance to SgrA*; the statistical errors of
0.13 x 10^6 M_sun and 0.12 kpc have halved compared to the previous study. The
S2 orbit fit is robust and does not need any prior information. Using
coordinate system priors, also the star S1 yields tight constraints on mass and
distance. For a combined orbit fit, we use 17 stars, which yields our current
best estimates for mass and distance: M = 4.28 +/- 0.10|stat. +/. 0.21|sys. x

spontaneously down to a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry. The dark matter particle,

the relic density can be explained by a novel Goldstone boson channel or by

carried out for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) and Snowdrift (SD) games that both use

is on using dynamic fitness landscapes as a mathematical model of
coevolutionary game dynamics. Hence, an alternative tool for analyzing
coevolutionary games becomes available, and landscape measures such as
modality, ruggedness and information content can be computed and analyzed. In
addition, fixation properties of the games and quantifiers characterizing the

Since its inception, the coherent interference caused by pilot contamination
has been believed to be an impairment that does not vanish, even with an
unlimited number of antennas. In this work, we show that this belief is
incorrect and an artifact from using simplistic channel models and suboptimal
signal processing schemes. We focus on the uplink and prove that with multicell

independence between the channel covariance matrices. This condition is
generally satisfied, except in special cases that are hardly found in practice.

high-order solutions to problems involving hyperbolic systems of PDEs. For
example, it has been demonstrated that for the same computational cost as a
Runge-Kutta scheme of a certain order, one can obtain an ADER scheme of one
higher order of accuracy. Additionally, Runge-Kutta schemes suffer from the
presence of Butcher barriers, limiting the order of temporal accuracy that one
can comfortably achieve. There are no such limitations present in ADER-WENO
schemes.
  The cumbersome analytical derivation of the temporal derivatives of the
solution required by the original ADER formulation has been replaced by the use
of a cell-wise local Galerkin predictor. The predictor can take either a
discontinuous or a continuous form. The Galerkin predictor is a high-order
polynomial reconstruction of the data in both space and time, found as the root
of a non-linear system.
  It has been conjectured that the eigenvalues of certain matrices appearing in
these non-linear systems are always zero, leading to desirable system
properties for certain classes of PDEs. It is proved here that this is in deed
the case for any number of spatial dimensions and any desired order of
accuracy, for both the discontinuous and continuous Galerkin variants. This
result is independent of the choice of reconstruction basis polynomials.

relative entropy, R\'enyi relative entropy, fidelity, and quantum Fisher

that the upper bounds are achievable for several discrimination measures of

squeezed two-mode vacuum state at the input of each channel use. Estimating the
excess noise of a thermal channel is of principal interest for the security of
quantum key distribution, in the setting where a fiber-optic cable has a known

of processors aims at cooperatively solving a class of min-max optimization
problems. This set-up is motivated by peak-demand minimization problems in
smart grids. Here, the goal is to minimize the peak value over a finite horizon
with: (i) the demand at each time instant being the sum of contributions from
different devices, and (ii) the device states at different time instants being
coupled through local constraints (e.g., the dynamics). The min-max structure
and the double coupling (through the devices and over the time horizon) makes
this problem challenging in a distributed set-up (e.g., existing distributed
dual decomposition approaches cannot be applied). We propose a distributed
algorithm based on the combination of duality methods and properties from
min-max optimization. Specifically, we repeatedly apply duality theory and
properly introduce ad-hoc slack variables in order to derive a series of
equivalent problems. On the resulting problem we apply a dual subgradient
method, which turns out to be a distributed algorithm consisting of a
minimization on the original primal variables and a suitable dual update. We
prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm in objective value. Moreover,
we show that every limit point of the primal sequence is an optimal (feasible)
solution. Finally, we provide numerical computations for a peak-demand

enables accomplishing complex tasks required by users based on elementary
(hardware and software) services available in ubiquitous environments. To
ensure that users experience the best Quality of Service (QoS) with respect to
their quality needs, service composition has to be QoS-aware. Establishing
QoS-aware service compositions entails efficient service selection taking into
account the QoS requirements of users. A challenging issue towards this purpose
is to consider service selection under global QoS requirements (i.e.,
requirements imposed by the user on the whole task), which is of high
computational cost. This challenge is even more relevant when we consider the
dynamics, limited computational resources and timeliness constraints of
ubiquitous environments. To cope with the above challenge, we present QASSA, an
efficient service selection algorithm that provides the appropriate ground for
QoS-aware service composition in ubiquitous environments. QASSA formulates
service selection under global QoS requirements as a set-based optimisation
problem, and solves this problem by combining local and global selection
techniques. In particular, it introduces a novel way of using clustering
techniques to enable fine-grained management of trade-offs between QoS
objectives. QASSA further considers: (i) dependencies between services, (ii)
adaptation at run-time, and (iii) both centralised and distributed design
fashions. Results of experimental studies performed using real QoS data are
presented to illustrate the timeliness and optimality of QASSA.

on secondary storage so that when one object is accessed from disk, all its
related objects are also brought into memory. Then access to these related
objects is a main memory access that is much faster than a disk access. The aim
of this paper is to compare the performance of three clustering algorithms:
Cactis, CK and ORION. Simulation experiments we performed showed that the
Cactis algorithm is better than the ORION algorithm and that the CK algorithm

requires comparison to viscous hydrodynamic or ""hybrid"" hydrodynamics+transport

without additional theory input the conversion is ambiguous for dissipative
fluids. Here, shear viscous phase-space corrections calculated using linearized
transport theory are applied in Cooper-Frye freezeout to quantify the effects
on anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n(p_T)$ at both RHIC and LHC energies.
Expanding upon our previous flow harmonics studies [1,2], we calculate pion and
proton $v_2(p_T)$, $v_4(p_T)$, and $v_6(p_T)$. Unlike in Ref. [1], we
incorporate a hadron gas that is chemically frozen below a temperature of 175
MeV, and use hypersurfaces from realistic viscous hydrodynamic simulations.
With additive quark model cross sections and relative phase-space corrections
with $p^{3/2}$ momentum dependence, rather than the quadratic Grad form, we
find at moderately high transverse momentum noticeably higher $v_4(p_T)$ and
$v_6(p_T)$ for protons than for pions. In addition, the value of $\eta /s$
deduced from elliptic flow data differs by nearly 50\% from the value extracted
using the naive ""democratic Grad"" form of freeze-out distributions. To
facilitate the use of the self-consistent viscous corrections calculated here
in hydrodynamic and hybrid calculations, we also present convenient

starting from the H + O$_2$ route is the reaction between H and H$_2$O$_2$.
This reaction is known to have a high activation energy and therefore at low
temperatures it can only proceed via tunneling. To date, however, no rate
constants are available at temperatures below 200 K. In this work, we use
instanton theory to compute rate constants for the title reaction with and
without isotopic substitutions down to temperatures of 50 K. The calculations
are based on density functional theory, with additional benchmarks for the
activation energy using unrestricted single-reference and multireference
coupled-cluster single-point energies. Gas-phase bimolecular rate constants are
calculated and compared with available experimental data not only for H +
H$_2$O$_2$ $\rightarrow$ H$_2$O + OH, but also for H + H$_2$O$_2$ $\rightarrow$
H$_2$ + HO$_2$. We find a branching ratio where the title reaction is favored
by at least two orders of magnitude at 114 K. In the interstellar medium this
reaction predominantly occurs on water surfaces, which increases the
probability that the two reactants meet. To mimic this one, two, or three
spectator H2O molecules are added to the system. Eley-Rideal bimolecular and
Langmuir-Hinshelwood unimolecular rate constants are presented here. The
kinetic isotope effects for the various cases are compared to experimental data
as well as to expressions commonly used in astrochemical models. Both the
rectangular barrier and the Eckart approximations lead to errors of about an
order of magnitude. Finally, fits of the rate constants are provided as input
for astrochemical models.

reflectivity with multiple laser scanners mounted on mobile robots/vehicles.
The problem originates because regions of the ground become populated with a
varying number of reflectivity measurements whose value depends on the observer
and its corresponding perspective. Here, we propose a novel automatic,
data-driven computational mapping framework specifically aimed at preserving
edge sharpness in the map reconstruction process and that considers the sources
of measurement variation. Our new formulation generates map-perspective
gradients and applies sub-set selection fusion and de-noising operators to
these through iterative algorithms that minimize an $\ell_1$ sparse regularized
least squares formulation. Reconstruction of the ground reflectivity is then
carried out based on Poisson's formulation posed as an $\ell_2$ term promoting
consistency with the fused gradient of map-perspectives and a term that ensures
equality constraints with reference measurement data. We demonstrate our new
framework outperforms the capabilities of existing ones with experiments
realized on Ford's fleet of autonomous vehicles. For example, we show we can
achieve map enhancement (i.e., contrast enhancement), artifact removal,
de-noising and map-stitching without requiring an additional reflectivity
adjustment to calibrate sensors to the specific mounting and robot/vehicle
motion.

This scheme has evolved over many decades and now includes numerous SN Types
and sub-types. Many of these are universally recognized, while there are
controversies regarding the definitions, membership and even the names of some
sub-classes; we will try to review here the commonly-used nomenclature, noting
the main variants when possible. SN Types are defined according to
observational properties; mostly visible-light spectra near maximum light, as
well as according to their photometric properties. However, a long-term goal of
SN classification is to associate observationally-defined classes with specific
physical explosive phenomena. We show here that this aspiration is now finally
coming to fruition, and we establish the SN classification scheme upon direct
observational evidence connecting SN groups with specific progenitor stars.
Observationally, the broad class of Type II SNe contains objects showing strong
spectroscopic signatures of hydrogen, while objects lacking such signatures are
of Type I, which is further divided to numerous subclasses. Recently a class of
super-luminous SNe (SLSNe, typically 10 times more luminous than standard
events) has been identified, and it is discussed. We end this chapter by
briefly describing a proposed alternative classification scheme that is
inspired by the stellar classification system. This system presents our
emerging physical understanding of SN explosions, while clearly separating
robust observational properties from physical inferences that can be debated.
This new system is quantitative, and naturally deals with events distributed
along a continuum, rather than being strictly divided into discrete classes.
Thus, it may be more suitable to the coming era where SN numbers will quickly
expand from a few thousands to millions of events.

cannot be optimally reduced using the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT)
because the spectrum can be shifted only by an integer number in the frequency

significant phase wrap reduction, in this paper, we propose a fast and precise
two-step method for phase wraps reduction, which uses the iterative local
discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to determine the sub-pixel spectral peak
location and the frequency shifting algorithm that operates in spatial domain
to reduce the number of phase wraps. Firstly, an initial estimate of the
frequency peak is obtain by FFT, then the sub-pixel spectral peak with high
resolution is determined by iteratively upsampling the local DFT around the
initial spectral peak location, further the non-integer frequency shifting in
spatial domain is realized to eliminate or reduce the number of phase wraps.
Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to prove the validity of the
proposed method. The results demonstrate the proposed method's superb computing

phase and amplitude noise of a stabilized OFC are measured simultaneously using
two analog-to-digital converters. Carrier recovery and phase detection are done
by post-processing, eliminating the need for external phase-locked loops and
complex calibration techniques. In order to adapt the measurement noise floor

excellent agreement with measurements of the fluctuations of the repetition

with theoretical predictions. However, for bitumen samples, as concentration of
bitumen increased the deviation between theoretical and experimental results
became larger. The higher deviation for high concentrations (i.e. above 30%)
can be due to the difference between dynamic contact angle and bulk contact

intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters provides a unique tool to evaluate
some spatial features of the magnetic fields there. Its combination with
numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence allows the
diagnosis of the ICM turbulence. Being the ICM plasma weakly collisional, the
thermal velocity distribution of the particles naturally develops anisotropies
as a consequence of the large scale motions and the conservation of the
magnetic moment of the charged particles. A previous study (Paper I) analyzed
the impact of large scale thermal anisotropy on the statistics of RM maps
synthesized from simulations of turbulence; these simulations employed a
collisionless MHD model which considered a tensor pressure with uniform
anisotropy. In the present work, we extend that analysis to a collisionless MHD
model in which the thermal anisotropy develops according to the conservation of
the magnetic moment of the thermal particles. We also consider the effect of
anisotropy relaxation caused by the micro-scale mirror and firehose
instabilities. We show that if the relaxation rate is fast enough to keep the
anisotropy limited by the threshold values of the instabilities, the dispersion
and power spectrum of the RM maps are indistinguishable from those obtained
from collisional MHD. Otherwise, there is a reduction in the dispersion and
steepening of the power spectrum of the RM maps (compared to the collisional
case). Considering the first scenario, the use of collisional MHD simulations
for modeling the RM statistics in the ICM becomes better justified.

15 January 2015. The arc was observed in DMSP UV and particle data and lasted
at least 3 h between 1700 and 2000 UT. The arc was more intense than the main
oval during this time. From all-sky imagers on Svalbard we were able to study
the evolution of the arc, which drifted slowly westward toward the dusk cell.
The intensity of the arc as observed from ground was 10-17 kR in 557.7 nm and
2-3.5 kR in 630.0 nm, i.e., significant emissions in both green and red
emission lines. We have used high-resolution raw data from global navigation
satellite systems (GNSS) receivers and backscatter from Super Dual Auroral
Radar Network (SuperDARN) radars to study irregularities and scintillation in
relation to the polar cap arc. Even though the literature has suggested that
polar cap arcs are potential sources for irregularities, our results indicate
only very weak irregularities. This may be due to the background density in the
northward IMF polar cap being too low for significant irregularities to be
created.

useful for many practical applications. This is exemplified through
calculations of Langevin type cross sections for forming a compound system of
two colliding spheres and through calculations of electron transfer cross
sections. We find that it is important to account for dielectric properties and
finite sphere sizes in such calculations, which for example may be useful for
describing the evolution, growth, and dynamics of nanometer sized dielectric

strong aurora borealis. If this was true, it would imply a very strong or even
severe geomagnetic storm during the quietest part of the Maunder minimum.

by a misinterpretation of the chronicle record. As a result of a thorough
analysis of the chronicle text, we show that the described phenomenon occurred
during the daylight period of the day (""the last morning hour""), in the south
direction (""towards noon""), and its description does not match that of an
aurora. The date of the event was also incorrectly interpreted. We conclude
that this phenomenon was not a mid-latitude aurora but an atmospheric
phenomenon, the so-called sundog (or parhelion) which is a particular type of
solar halo. Accordingly, the claim about a strong mid-latitude aurora during
the deep Maunder minimum is not correct and should be dismissed.

encouraging the neural network acoustic model to learn invariant feature

Generative Adversarial Networks and domain adaptation ideas extending
adversarial gradient-based training. A recent work from Ganin et al. proposes
to use adversarial training for image domain adaptation by using an
intermediate representation from the main target classification network to
deteriorate the domain classifier performance through a separate neural
network. Our work focuses on investigating neural architectures which produce
representations invariant to noise conditions for ASR. We evaluate the proposed
architecture on the Aurora-4 task, a popular benchmark for noise robust ASR. We
show that our method generalizes better than the standard multi-condition
training especially when only a few noise categories are seen during training.
