computing. In this paper, we consider a more flexible pricing model for
instance reservation, in which a customer can propose the time length and
number of resources of her request, while in today's industry, customers can
only choose from several predefined reservation packages. Under this model, we
design randomized mechanisms for customers coming online to optimize social
welfare and providers' revenue.
  We first consider a simple case, where the requests from the customers do not
vary too much in terms of both length and value density. We design a randomized
mechanism that achieves a competitive ratio $\frac{1}{42}$ for both
\emph{social welfare} and \emph{revenue}, which is a improvement as there is
usually no revenue guarantee in previous works such as
\cite{azar2015ec,wang2015selling}. This ratio can be improved up to
$\frac{1}{11}$ when we impose a realistic constraint on the maximum number of
resources used by each request. On the hardness side, we show an upper bound
$\frac{1}{3}$ on competitive ratio for any randomized mechanism. We then extend
our mechanism to the general case and achieve a competitive ratio
$\frac{1}{42\log k\log T}$ for both social welfare and revenue, where $T$ is
the ratio of the maximum request length to the minimum request length and $k$
is the ratio of the maximum request value density to the minimum request value
density. This result outperforms the previous upper bound $\frac{1}{CkT}$ for
deterministic mechanisms \cite{wang2015selling}. We also prove an upper bound
$\frac{2}{\log 8kT}$ for any randomized mechanism. All the mechanisms we
provide are in a greedy style. They are truthful and easy to be integrated into
practical cloud systems.

  Cloud Services",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the severity of vulnerabilities within cloud services is
particularly important for today service administrators.Although many systems,
e.g., CVSS, have been built to evaluate and score the severity of
vulnerabilities for administrators, the scoring schemes employed by these
systems fail to take into account the contextual information of specific
services having these vulnerabilities, such as what roles they play in a
particular service. Such a deficiency makes resulting scores unhelpful. This
paper presents a practical framework, NCVS, that offers automatic and
contextual scoring mechanism to evaluate the severity of vulnerabilities for a
particular service. Specifically, for a given service S, NCVS first
automatically collects S contextual information including topology,
configurations, vulnerabilities and their dependencies. Then, NCVS uses the
collected information to build a contextual dependency graph, named CDG, to
model S context. Finally, NCVS scores and ranks all the vulnerabilities in S by
analyzing S context, such as what roles the vulnerabilities play in S, and how
critical they affect the functionality of S. NCVS is novel and useful, because
1) context-based vulnerability scoring results are highly relevant and
meaningful for administrators to understand each vulnerability importance
specific to the target service; and 2) the workflow of NCVS does not need
instrumentation or modifications to any source code. Our experimental results
demonstrate that NCVS can obtain more relevant vulnerability scoring results
than comparable system, such as CVSS.

academia and industry. In this paper, we propose a runtime intrusion detection
technique that understands and works according to the properties of such
distributed compute platforms. The proposed method is based on runtime analysis
of system and library calls and memory access patterns of tasks running on the
datanodes (slaves). First, the primary datanode of a big data system creates a
behavior profile for every task it executes. A behavior profile includes (a)
trace of the system & library calls made, and (b) sequence representing the
sizes of private and shared memory accesses made during task execution. Then,
the process behavior profile is shared with other replica datanodes that are
scheduled to execute the same task on their copy of the same data. Next, these
replica datanodes verify their local tasks with the help of the information
embedded in the received behavior profiles. This is realized in two steps: (i)
comparing the system & library calls metadata, and (ii) statistical matching of
the memory access patterns. Finally, datanodes share their observations for
consensus and report an intrusion to the namenode (master) if they find any
discrepancy. The proposed solution was tested on a small hadoop cluster using
the default MapReduce examples and the results show that our approach can
detect insider attacks that cannot be detected with the traditional analysis
metrics.

model-free control protocol for force controlling of an Underwater Vehicle
Manipulator System which is in contact with a compliant environment, without
incorporating any knowledge of the UVMS's dynamic model, exogenous disturbances
and sensor's noise model. Moreover, the transient and steady state response as
well as reduction of overshooting force error are solely determined by certain
designer-specified performance functions and are fully decoupled by the UVMS's
dynamic model, the control gain selection, as well as the initial conditions.
Finally, a simulation study clarifies the proposed method and verifies its
efficiency.

properties of bilayer armchair graphene nano-ribbons. Using atomistic
simulations with Tight Binding calculations and the Non-equilibrium Green
function formalism, we demonstrate that (i) in semi-metallic structures,
vertical fields impact more effectively than transverse fields in terms of
opening larger bandgap, showing a contrary phenomenon compared to that
demonstrated in previous studies in bilayer zigzag graphene nano-ribbons; (ii)
in some semiconducting structures, if transverse fields just show usual effects
as in single layer armchair graphene nano-ribbons where the bandgap is
suppressed when varying the applied potential, vertical fields exhibit an
anomalous phenomenon that the bandgap can be enlarged, i.e., for a structure of
width of 16 dimer lines, the bandgap increases from 0.255 eV to the maximum
value of 0.40 eV when a vertical bias equates 0.96 V applied. Although the
combined effect of two fields does not enlarge the bandgap as found in bilayer
zigzag graphene nano-ribbons, it shows that the mutual effect can be useful to
reduce faster the bandgap in semiconducting bilayer armchair graphene
nano-ribbons. These results are important to fully understand the effects of
electric fields on bilayer graphene nano-ribbons (AB stacking) and also suggest
appropriate uses of electric gates with different edge orientations.

neutral and photoelectrons can either recombine with holes bound to acceptors
(e-A0 line) or form excitons which are mostly trapped on neutral acceptors
forming the (A0X) complex. It is found that the spin lifetime is shorter for
electrons that recombine through the e-A0 transition due to spin relaxation
generated by the exchange scattering of free electrons with either trapped or
free holes, whereas spin flip processes are less likely to occur once the
electron forms with a free hole an exciton bound to a neutral acceptor. An
increase of exci- tation power induces a cross-over to a regime where the
bimolecular band-to-band (b-b) emission becomes more favorable due to screening
of the electron-hole Coulomb interaction and ionization of excitonic complexes
and free excitons. Then, the formation of excitons is no longer possible, the
carrier recombination lifetime increases and the spin lifetime is found to
decrease dramatically with concentration due to fast spin relaxation with free
photoholes. In this high density regime, both the electrons that recombine
through the e-A0 transition and through the b-b transition have the same spin
relaxation time.

Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) and Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) detected in

In particular, we want to estimate the AGN contribution to the [U]LIRGs'
infrared emission and which types of AGNs are related to their activity. We
examined 69 galaxies at z>0.05 detected at 90um by the AKARI satellite in the
ADF-S, with optical counterparts and spectral coverage from the ultraviolet to
the FIR. We used two independent spectral energy distribution fitting codes:
one fitting the SED from FIR to FUV (CIGALE) and gray-body + power spectrum fit
for the infrared part of the spectra (CMCIRSED) in order to identify a
subsample of [U]LIRGs, and to estimate their properties. Based on the CIGALE
SED fitting, we have found that [U]LIRGs selected at the 90um AKARI band
compose ~56% of our sample (we found 17 ULIRGs and 22 LIRGs, spanning over the
redshift range 0.06<z<1.23). Their physical parameters, such as stellar mass,
star formation rate (SFR), and specific SFR are consistent with the ones found
for other samples selected at IR wavelengths. We have detected a significant
AGN contribution to the MIR luminosity for 63% of LIRGs and ULIRGs. Our LIRGs
contain Type 1, Type 2, and intermediate types of AGN, whereas for ULIRGs, a
majority (more than 50%) of AGN emission originates from Type 2 AGNs. The
temperature--luminosity and temperature--mass relations for the dust component
of ADF--S LIRGs and ULIRGs indicate that these relations are shaped by the dust
mass and not by the increased dust heating. We conclude that LIRGs contain Type
1, Type 2, and intermediate types of AGNs, with an AGN contribution to the MIR
emission at the median level of 13+/-3%, whereas the majority of ULIRGs contain
Type 2 AGNs, with a median AGN fraction equal to 19+/-8%.

commonly used by industries to access material's long-term properties. In many
applications, the accelerating variable is usually the temperature. In such
cases, a thermal index (TI) is used to indicate the strength of the material.
For example, a TI of 200C may be interpreted as the material can be expected to
maintain a specific property at a temperature of 200C for 100,000 hours. A
material with a higher TI possesses a stronger resistance to thermal damage. In
literature, there are three methods available to estimate the TI based on ADDT
data, which are the traditional method based on the least-squares approach, the
parametric method, and the semiparametric method. In this chapter, we provide a
comprehensive review of the three methods and illustrate how the TI can be
estimated based on different models. We also conduct comprehensive simulation
studies to show the properties of different methods. We provide thorough
discussions on the pros and cons of each method. The comparisons and discussion

in $F$, and also to assign clients to facilities so that the number of clients
assigned to any facility is at most the capacity installed; the objective is
then to minimize the maximum distance between a client and its assigned
facility. If all the capacities $c_i$'s are identical, the problem becomes the
well-studied uniform capacitated $k$-center problem for which constant-factor
approximations are known. The additional choice of determining which capacity
should be installed in which location makes our problem considerably different
from this problem, as well the non-uniform generalizations studied thus far in
literature. In fact, one of our contributions is in relating the heterogeneous
problem to special-cases of the classical Santa Claus problem. Using this
connection, and by designing new algorithms for these special cases, we get the
following results: (a)A quasi-polynomial time $O(\log

(b) A polynomial time $O(1)$-approximation where every capacity is violated by
an $O(\log n)$ factor. We get improved results for the {\em soft-capacities}

interactions across the nematic phase transition in single crystals of
FeSe1-xSx using Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in high magnetic fields up to 45
tesla in the low temperature regime. The unusually small and strongly elongated
Fermi surface of FeSe increases monotonically with chemical pressure, x, due to
the suppression of the in-plane anisotropy except for the smallest orbit which
suffers a Lifshitz-like transition once nematicity disappears. Even outside the
nematic phase the Fermi surface continues to increase, in stark contrast to the
reconstructed Fermi surface detected in FeSe under applied external pressure.
We detect signatures of orbital-dependent quasiparticle mass renomalization
suppressed for those orbits with dominant dxz=yz character, but unusually
enhanced for those orbits with dominant dxy character. The lack of enhanced
superconductivity outside the nematic phase in FeSe1-xSx suggest that
nematicity may not play the essential role in enhancing Tc in these systems.

successive interference cancellation (SIC) in downlink multiuser multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) cellular systems, where the total number of receive
antennas at user equipment (UE) ends in a cell is more than the number of
transmit antennas at the base station (BS). We first dynamically group the UE
receive antennas into a number of clusters equal to or more than the number of
BS transmit antennas. A single beamforming vector is then shared by all the
receive antennas in a cluster. We propose a linear beamforming technique in
which all the receive antennas can significantly cancel the inter-cluster
interference. On the other hand, the receive antennas in each cluster are
scheduled on power domain NOMA basis with SIC at the receiver ends. For
inter-cluster and intra-cluster power allocation, we provide dynamic power
allocation solutions with an objective to maximizing the overall cell capacity.
An extensive performance evaluation is carried out for the proposed MIMO-NOMA
system and the results are compared with those for conventional orthogonal
multiple access (OMA)-based MIMO systems and other existing MIMO-NOMA
solutions. The numerical results quantify the capacity gain of the proposed
MIMO-NOMA model over MIMO-OMA and other existing MIMO-NOMA solutions.

large star-forming regions with a metallicity lower than the rest of the
galaxy. Such a chemical inhomogeneity reveals the external origin of the
metal-poor gas fueling star formation, possibly indicating accretion from the
cosmic web. This paper studies the kinematic properties of the ionized gas in
these galaxies. Most XMPs have rotation velocity around a few tens of km/s. The
star-forming regions appear to move coherently. The velocity is constant within
each region, and the velocity dispersion sometimes increases within the
star-forming clump towards the galaxy midpoint, suggesting inspiral motion
toward the galaxy center. Other regions present a local maximum in velocity
dispersion at their center, suggesting a moderate global expansion. The Halpha
line wings show a number of faint emission features with amplitudes around a
few percent of the main Halpha component, and wavelength shifts between 100 and
400 km/s. The components are often paired, so that red and blue emission
features with similar amplitudes and shifts appear simultaneously. Assuming the
faint emission to be produced by expanding shell-like structures, the inferred
mass loading factor (mass loss rate divided by star formation rate) exceeds 10.
Since the expansion velocity exceeds by far the rotational and turbulent
velocities, the gas may eventually escape from the galaxy disk. The observed
motions involve energies consistent with the kinetic energy released by
individual core-collapse supernovae. Alternative explanations for the faint
emission have been considered and discarded.

Renormalization group considerations predict the spectrum of such a system to
show hyperscaling, i.e. dimensionless ratios of hadron masses or decay
constants are independent of the heavy mass. Hyperscaling is present for bound
states of light, heavy, or a combination of heavy and light flavors and leads
to a strongly predictive model. Despite chiral symmetry breaking, this system
features a spectrum exhibiting a very non-QCD like behavior. Furthermore, the
gauge coupling becomes an irrelevant parameter. We support these expectations
by presenting numerical results based on four different values of the heavy

$am_\ell$, and include, for the first time, preliminary data at a second value

every simple closed curve in the plane inscribes a (non-degenerate) square, in
the sense that all four vertices of that square lie on the curve. By a variety
of arguments of a ""homological"" nature, it is known that the answer to this
question is positive if the curve is sufficiently regular. The regularity
hypotheses are needed to rule out the possibility of arbitrarily small squares
that are inscribed or almost inscribed on the curve; because of this, these
arguments do not appear to be robust enough to handle arbitrarily rough curves.
  In this paper we augment the homological approach by introducing certain

longitudinal diffusion coefficient, and effective ionization frequency) in CO2
measured under time-of-flight conditions over a wide range of the reduced
electric field, 15Td <= E/N <= 2660Td in a scanning drift tube apparatus. The
data obtained in the experiments are also applied to determine the effective
steady-state Townsend ionization coefficient. These parameters are compared to
the results of previous experimental studies, as well as to results of various
kinetic computations: solutions of the electron Boltzmann equation under
different approximations (multiterm and density gradient expansions) and Monte
Carlo simulations. The experimental data extend the range of E/N compared with
previous measurements and are consistent with most of the transport parameters
obtained in these earlier studies. The computational results point out the
range of applicability of the respective approaches to determine the different
measured transport properties of electrons in CO2. They demonstrate as well the
need for further improvement of the electron collision cross section data for
CO2 taking into account the present experimental data.

  The effective resistance metric is essential to our algorithm, as in the work

techniques used by previous algorithms. Instead, our algorithm is based on
Gaussian elimination, and the fact that effective resistance is preserved in
the graph resulting from eliminating a subset of vertices (called a Schur
complement). As part of our algorithm, we show how to compute
$\epsilon$-approximate effective resistances for a set $S$ of vertex pairs via
approximate Schur complements in $\tilde{O}(m+(n + |S|)\epsilon^{-2})$ time,
without using the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma which requires $\tilde{O}(
\min\{(m + |S|)\epsilon^{-2}, m+n\epsilon^{-4} +|S|\epsilon^{-2}\})$ time. We
combine this approximation procedure with an error correction procedure for

function of a single parameter, the fraction of time the spot is visible, which
is related to the sinusoidality of the spot modulation. We identify the

prior and a likelihood. One hopes that the posterior is robust to reasonable
variation in the choice of prior, since this choice is made by the modeler and
is often somewhat subjective. A different, equally subjectively plausible
choice of prior may result in a substantially different posterior, and so
different conclusions drawn from the data. Were this to be the case, our
conclusions would not be robust to the choice of prior. To determine whether
our model is robust, we must quantify how sensitive our posterior is to
perturbations of our prior. Despite the importance of the problem and a
considerable body of literature, generic, easy-to-use methods to quantify
Bayesian robustness are still lacking.
  Abstract In this paper, we demonstrate that powerful measures of robustness
can be easily calculated from Variational Bayes (VB) approximate posteriors. We
begin with local robustness, which measures the effect of infinitesimal changes
to the prior on a posterior mean of interest. In particular, we show that the
influence function of Gustafson (2012) has a simple, easy-to-calculate closed
form expression for VB approximations. We then demonstrate how local robustness
measures can be inadequate for non-local prior changes, such as replacing one
prior entirely with another. We propose a simple approximate non-local
robustness measure and demonstrate its effectiveness on a simulated data set.

known for 30 years. However, the importance of the different contributions is
still not well established. With this in mind, we developed an empirical model
to estimate the spot-induced frequency shifts, which takes into account the
sunspot properties, such as area and latitude. The comparison between the model
frequency shifts obtained from the daily sunspot records and those observed
suggests that the contribution from a stochastic component to the total
frequency shifts is about 30%. The remaining 70% is related to a global,
long-term variation. We also propose a new observable to investigate the short-
and mid-term variations of the frequency shifts, which is insensitive to the
long-term variations contained in the data. On the shortest time scales the
variations in the frequency shifts are strongly correlated with the variations
in the total area covered by sunspots. However, a significant loss of
correlation is still found, which cannot be fully explained by ignoring the
invisible side of the Sun when accounting for the total sunspot area. We also
verify that the times when the frequency shifts and the sunspot areas do not
vary in a similar way tend to coincide with the times of the maximum amplitude
of the quasi-biennial variations found in the seismic data.

of the theory, i.e., $\beta$ functions and anomalous dimensions $\gamma$. We
perform a detailed calculation of these functions at two loops, finding that
these do not depend on $\alpha$, and therefore, by using the RGE, we calculate
the effective superpotencial $K_{\mathrm{eff}}$, showing that it is also
independent of $\alpha$. Then we discuss the improvement of the calculation of
$K_{\mathrm{eff}}$ by summing up leading logarithms, and we compare this
improvement with the one obtained in the non supersymmetric version of the
model. Finally, we study the DSB finding that it is operational for all
reasonable values of the free parameters, while the improvement obtained from
the RGE in general only produces a small quantitative correction in the
results, instead of the more dramatic qualitative change found in non
supersymmetric models.

  Approach",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the $k$-forest problem in the model of resource
augmentation. In the $k$-forest problem, given an edge-weighted graph $G(V,E)$,
a parameter $k$, and a set of $m$ demand pairs $\subseteq V \times V$, the
objective is to construct a minimum-cost subgraph that connects at least $k$
demands. The problem is hard to approximate---the best-known approximation
ratio is $O(\min\{\sqrt{n}, \sqrt{k}\})$. Furthermore, $k$-forest is as hard to
approximate as the notoriously-hard densest $k$-subgraph problem.
  While the $k$-forest problem is hard to approximate in the worst-case, we
show that with the use of resource augmentation, we can efficiently approximate
it up to a constant factor.
  First, we restate the problem in terms of the number of demands that are {\em
not} connected. In particular, the objective of the $k$-forest problem can be
viewed as to remove at most $m-k$ demands and find a minimum-cost subgraph that
connects the remaining demands. We use this perspective of the problem to
explain the performance of our algorithm (in terms of the augmentation) in a
more intuitive way.
  Specifically, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for the $k$-forest
problem that, for every $\epsilon>0$, removes at most $m-k$ demands and has
cost no more than $O(1/\epsilon^{2})$ times the cost of an optimal algorithm
that removes at most $(1-\epsilon)(m-k)$ demands.

demonstrate it, we construct an NHQW on a one-dimensional lattice, with a

In contrast, the NHQW constructed in this paper is realized as a
single-particle sector of the more general quantum cellular automaton (QCA).

QWs to conceivably allow for modeling fundamental physics incorporating quantum

of in-plane emitted particles by the spectator matter is not the main reason
for the EoS dependence of the elliptic flow at mid-rapidity but different
density gradients (and therefore different forces) in the direction of the
impact parameter (x-direction) as compared to the direction perpendicular to
the reaction plan (y-direction), caused by the presence of the spectator

more and creates therefore a negative v2. When using a soft momentum dependent

discrimination from the historical data, and removing the discriminatory
effects before the data is used for predictive analysis (e.g., building
classifiers). We make use of the causal network to capture the causal structure
of the data. Then we model direct and indirect discrimination as the
path-specific effects, which explicitly distinguish the two types of
discrimination as the causal effects transmitted along different paths in the
network. Based on that, we propose an effective algorithm for discovering
direct and indirect discrimination, as well as an algorithm for precisely
removing both types of discrimination while retaining good data utility.
Different from previous works, our approaches can ensure that the predictive
models built from the modified data will not incur discrimination in decision
making. Experiments using real datasets show the effectiveness of our
approaches.

describe materials exhibiting turbostratic disorder between layers of
incommensurate constituents. These calculations approximate one of the
constituents as a finite island between continuous layers of the other
constituent. This island approximation allows equal treatment of all relative
angles between the interleaved layers, and it removes the requirement of a unit
cell that is commensurate with both layers. The work presented here uses this
approximation to search for new layered materials that exhibit turbostratic
disorder and magnetic structure. In a first application, the approach finds the
recently synthesized SnSe$_2$-VSe$_2$ system. The approach predicts a stable
Fe$_3$Ge-VSe$_2$ structure and multiple stable structures that interleave
Mn$_x$Se$_y$ layers with VSe$_2$ layers. These Mn$_x$Se$_y$ layers exhibit
emergent structures and stability.

all nucleobases by computationally modeling 18 reactions that potentially

identify the two most important reactions for each nucleobase and find that
these involve small molecules such as HCN, CO, NH3, and water that ultimately
arise from the protoplanetary disks in which planetesimals are built. The
primary result of this study is that cytosine is unlikely to persist within
meteorite parent bodies due to aqueous deamination. Thymine has a
thermodynamically favourable reaction pathway from uracil, formaldehyde and
formic acid, but likely did not persist within planetesimals containing H2O2
due to an oxidation reaction with this molecule. Finally, while FT synthesis is
found to be the dominant source of nucleobases within our model planetesimal,
NC synthesis may still be significant under certain chemical conditions (e.g.

practical implementations, however, neglect higher-order interaction vertices
beyond two-particle scattering in the dual effective action and further
truncate the diagrammatic expansion in the two-particle scattering vertex to a
leading-order or ladder-type approximation. In this work we compute the
dual-fermion expansion for the two-dimensional Hubbard model including all

self-energy against numerically exact Diagrammatic Determinant Monte Carlo
simulations to systematically assess convergence of the dual-fermion series and
the validity of these approximations. We observe that, from high temperatures
down to the vicinity of the DMFT N\'eel transition, the dual-fermion series
converges very quickly to the exact solution in the whole range of Hubbard
interactions considered ($4 \leq U/t \leq 12$), implying that contributions
from higher-order vertices are small. As the temperature is lowered further, we
observe slower series convergence, convergence to incorrect solutions, and
ultimately divergence. This happens in a regime where magnetic correlations
become significant. We find however that the self-consistent particle-hole
ladder approximation yields reasonable and often even highly accurate results
in this regime.

in fixed apertures to characterize the environment of galaxies brighter than
$JH_{140} < 24$ mag in the redshift range $0.5<z<3.0$. By linking observed
galaxies to a mock sample, selected to reproduce the 3D-HST sample selection
and redshift accuracy, each 3D-HST galaxy is assigned a probability density
function of the host halo mass, and a probability that is a central or a
satellite galaxy. The same procedure is applied to a $z=0$ sample selected from
SDSS. We compute the fraction of passive central and satellite galaxies as a
function of stellar and halo mass, and redshift, and then derive the fraction
of galaxies that were quenched by environment specific processes. Using the
mock sample, we estimate that the timescale for satellite quenching is $t_{\rm
quench} \sim 2-5$ Gyr; longer at lower stellar mass or lower redshift, but
remarkably independent of halo mass. This indicates that, in the range of
environments commonly found within the 3D-HST sample, satellites are quenched
by exhaustion of their gas reservoir in absence of cosmological accretion. We
find that the quenching times can be separated into a delay phase during which
satellite galaxies behave similarly to centrals at fixed stellar mass, and a
phase where the star formation rate drops rapidly ($\sim 0.4-0.6$ Gyr), as
shown previously at $z=0$. We conclude that this scenario requires satellite
galaxies to retain a large reservoir of multi-phase gas upon accretion, even at
high redshift, and that this gas sustains star formation for the long quenching
times observed.

out the possibility of Andreev bound states in the vortex core as contributors

hydrogen (HI) content of our Universe in the post-reionization era, probing
both its mass content and volume distribution. We compute the auto-power
spectra of both fields together with their cross-power spectrum at z = 2.4 and
find that on large scales the fields are completely anti-correlated. This
anti-correlation arises because regions with high (low) 21cm emission, such as
those with a large (low) concentration of damped Lyman-alpha systems, will show
up as regions with low (high) transmitted flux. We find that on scales smaller
than k = 0.2 h/Mpc the cross-correlation coefficient departs from -1, at a
scale where non-linearities show up. We use the anisotropy of the power spectra
in redshift-space to determine the values of the bias and of the redshift-space
distortion parameters of both fields; we find that the errors on the value of
these parameters could decrease by 30% when adding data from the cross-power
spectrum in a conservative analysis. Our results point out that linear theory
is capable of reproducing the shape and amplitude of the cross-power up to
rather non-linear scales. Finally, we find that the 21cm-Lya cross-power
spectrum can be detected by combining data from a BOSS-like survey together

accurate gravitational waveforms. The availability of hundreds of these
numerical relativity (NR) waveforms, often containing many higher spherical
harmonic modes, allows one to study many aspects of gravitational waves.
Amongst these are the response of data analysis pipelines, the calibration of
semi-analytical models, the building of reduced-order surrogates, the
estimation of the parameters of detected gravitational waves, and the
composition of public catalogs of NR waveform data. The large number of
generated NR waveforms consequently requires efficient data storage and
handling, especially since many more waveforms will be generated at an
increased rate in the forthcoming years. In addition, gravitational wave data
analyses often require the NR waveforms to be interpolated and uniformly
resampled at high sampling rates. Previously, this resulted in very large data
files (up to $\sim$ several GB) in memory-intensive operations, which is
unfeasible when confronted with hundreds of multi-modal NR waveforms. To handle
these challenges, we present a simple and efficient method to significantly
\emph{compress} the original waveform data sets while accurately reproducing
the original data via spline interpolation. The method is generically
applicable to relatively smooth, one-dimensional datasets and uses a greedy
algorithm to determine the most relevant subset of the full data such that a
spline interpolant of a specified polynomial degree will represent the original
data to within a requested point-wise tolerance. We find significant
compression of the original NR data sets presented here. These compressed data
sets can then be evaluated fast and efficiently and resampled as desired.

Quantum Grav. 34 (2017) 104002","10.1088/1361-6382/aa6854","P1500259","gr-qc astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Parameter estimates of GW150914 were obtained using Bayesian inference, based
on three semi-analytic waveform models for binary black hole coalescences.
These waveform models differ from each other in their treatment of black hole
spins, and all three models make some simplifying assumptions, notably to
neglect sub-dominant waveform harmonic modes and orbital eccentricity.
Furthermore, while the models are calibrated to agree with waveforms obtained
by full numerical solutions of Einstein's equations, any such calibration is
accurate only to some non-zero tolerance and is limited by the accuracy of the
underlying phenomenology, availability, quality, and parameter-space coverage
of numerical simulations. This paper complements the original analyses of
GW150914 with an investigation of the effects of possible systematic errors in
the waveform models on estimates of its source parameters. To test for
systematic errors we repeat the original Bayesian analyses on mock signals from
numerical simulations of a series of binary configurations with parameters
similar to those found for GW150914. Overall, we find no evidence for a
systematic bias relative to the statistical error of the original parameter
recovery of GW150914 due to modeling approximations or modeling inaccuracies.
However, parameter biases are found to occur for some configurations disfavored
by the data of GW150914: for binaries inclined edge-on to the detector over a
small range of choices of polarization angles, and also for eccentricities
greater than $\sim$0.05. For signals with higher signal-to-noise ratio than
GW150914, or in other regions of the binary parameter space (lower masses,
larger mass ratios, or higher spins), we expect that systematic errors in
current waveform models may impact gravitational-wave measurements, making more
accurate models desirable for future observations.

""characteristic width"". This finding is in tension with spatial power spectra
of the data, which show no indication of this characteristic scale. We
demonstrate that this discrepancy is a result of the methodology adopted for
measuring filament widths. First, we perform the previously used analysis
technique on artificial scale-free data, and obtain a peaked width distribution
of filament-like structures. Next, we repeat the analysis on three Herschel
maps and reproduce the narrow distribution of widths found in previous studies
$-$ when considering the average width of each filament. However, the
distribution of widths measured at all points along a filament spine is broader
than the distribution of mean filament widths, indicating that the narrow
spread (interpreted as a ""characteristic"" width) results from averaging.
Furthermore, the width is found to vary significantly from one end of a
filament to the other. Therefore, the previously identified peak at 0.1 pc
cannot be understood as representing the typical width of filaments. We find an
alternative explanation by modelling the observed width distribution as a
truncated power-law distribution, sampled with uncertainties. The position of
the peak is connected to the lower truncation scale and is likely set by the
choice of parameters used in measuring filament widths. We conclude that a
""characteristic"" width of filaments is not supported by the available data.

known as giant radio haloes. One promising model for radio haloes is Fermi-II
acceleration of seed relativistic electrons by compressible turbulence. The
origin of these seed electrons has never been fully explored. Here, we
integrate the Fokker-Planck equation of the cosmic ray (CR) electron and proton
distributions when post-processing cosmological simulations of cluster
formation, and confront them with radio surface brightness and spectral data of
Coma. For standard assumptions, structure formation shocks lead to a seed
electron population which produces too centrally concentrated radio emission.
Matching observations requires modifying properties of the CR population (rapid
streaming; enhanced CR electron acceleration at shocks) or turbulence
(increasing turbulent-to-thermal energy density with radius), but at the
expense of fine-tuning. In a parameter study, we find that radio properties are
exponentially sensitive to the amplitude of turbulence, which is inconsistent
with small scatter in scaling relations. This sensitivity is removed if we
relate the acceleration time to the turbulent dissipation time. In this case,
turbulence above a threshold value provides a fixed amount of amplification;
observations could thus potentially constrain the unknown CR seed population.
To obtain sufficient acceleration, the turbulent magneto-hydrodynamics cascade
has to terminate by transit time damping on CRs, i.e., thermal particles must
be scattered by plasma instabilities. Understanding the small scatter in radio
halo scaling relations may provide a rich source of insight on plasma processes
in clusters.

which one takes the transpose only for a subsystem of the full Hilbert space,
has been recognized as a useful tool to diagnose quantum entanglement. It can
be used, for example, to define the (logarithmic) negativity. For fermionic
systems, it has been known that the partial transpose of Gaussian fermionic
density matrices is not Gaussian. In this work, we propose to use partial
time-reversal transformation to define (an analog of) the entanglement
negativity and related quantities. We demonstrate that for the
symmetry-protected topological phase realized in the Kitaev chain the
conventional definition of the partial transpose (and hence the entanglement
negativity) fails to capture the formation of the edge Majorana fermions, while
the partial time-reversal computes the quantum dimension of the Majorana
fermions. Furthermore, we show that the partial time-reversal of fermionic

multiplexing and quantum communication -- basis-specific principles are invoked
that are altogether distinct from that of `delay.' Here, we extend the
traditional concept of temporal delay to the spatial domain, thereby enabling
the analysis of a beam in an arbitrary spatial-mode basis -- exemplified using
Hermite-Gaussian and radial Laguerre-Gaussian modes. Such generalized delays
correspond to optical implementations of fractional transforms; for example,
the fractional Hankel transform is the generalized delay associated with the
space of Laguerre-Gaussian modes, and an interferometer incorporating such a

crux is a data structure for blossom creation. It uses a dynamic
nearest-common-ancestor algorithm to simplify blossom steps, so they involve
only back edges rather than arbitrary nontree edges.
  The rest of the paper presents direct extensions of Edmonds' blossom
algorithm to weighted $b$-matching and $f$-factors. Again the time bound is the
one previously known for bipartite graphs: for $b$-matching the time is
$O(\min\{b(V),n\log n\}(m + n\log n))$ and for $f$-factors the time is
$O(\min\{f(V),m\log n\}( m + n\log n) )$, where $b(V)$ and $f(V)$ denote the
sum of all degree constraints. Several immediate applications of the $f$-factor
algorithm are given: The generalized shortest path structure of \cite{GS13},
i.e., the analog of the shortest path tree for conservative undirected graphs,
is shown to be a version of the blossom structure for $f$-factors. This
structure is found in time $O(|N|(m+n\log n))$ for $N$ the set of negative
edges ($0<|N|<n$). A shortest $T$-join is found in time $O(n(m+n\log n))$, or
$O(|T|(m+n\log n))$ when all costs are nonnegative. These bounds are all slight
improvements of previously known ones, and are simply achieved by proper

also a graph-based label propagation to discover harder instances in adjacent

predictive quality atomistic understanding of complex surface chemical reaction
kinetics over a wide range of reaction conditions. In order to expand their
practical value in terms of giving guidelines for atomic level design of
catalytic systems, it is very desirable to readily evaluate a sensitivity
analysis for a given model. The result of such a sensitivity analysis
quantitatively expresses the dependency of the turnover frequency, being the
main output variable, on the rate constants entering the model. In the past the
application of sensitivity analysis, such as Degree of Rate Control, has been
hampered by its exuberant computational effort required to accurately sample
numerical derivatives of a property that is obtained from a stochastic
simulation method. In this study we present an efficient and robust three stage
approach that is capable of reliably evaluating the sensitivity measures for
stiff microkinetic models as we demonstrate using CO oxidation on RuO2(110) as
a prototypical reaction. In a first step, we utilize the Fisher Information
Matrix for filtering out elementary processes which only yield negligible
sensitivity. Then we employ an estimator based on linear response theory for
calculating the sensitivity measure for non-critical conditions which covers
the majority of cases. Finally we adopt a method for sampling coupled finite
differences for evaluating the sensitivity measure of lattice based models.
This allows efficient evaluation even in critical regions near a second order
phase transition that are hitherto difficult to control. The combined approach
leads to significant computational savings over straightforward numerical
derivatives and should aid in accelerating the nano scale design of
heterogeneous catalysts.

learning an over-complete dictionary in sparse representation. In the sparse
decomposition, we propose a novel method to identify principal atoms from
over-complete dictionary to form a principal dictionary. Despeckling is
performed on each data set over the principal dictionary with principal atoms.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve high
performances in terms of both speckle noise reduction and structure details
preservation.

face major challenges. Their resource constraints require high efficiency in
development. Furthermore, quality assurance (QA) measures need to be taken to
mitigate the risk of additional, expensive effort for bug fixes or
compensations. Automated static analysis (ASA) can reduce this risk because it
promises low application effort. SMEs seem to take little advantage of this
opportunity. Instead, they still mainly rely on the dynamic analysis approach
of software testing. In this article, we report on our experiences from a
technology transfer project. Our aim was to evaluate the results static
analysis can provide for SMEs as well as the problems that occur when
introducing and using static analysis in SMEs. We analysed five software
projects from five collaborating SMEs using three different ASA techniques:
code clone detection, bug pattern detection and architecture conformance
analysis. Following the analysis, we applied a quality model to aggregate and
evaluate the results. Our study shows that the effort required to introduce ASA
techniques in SMEs is small (mostly below one person-hour each). Furthermore,
we encountered only few technical problems. By means of the analyses, we could
detect multiple defects in production code. The participating companies
perceived the analysis results to be a helpful addition to their current QA and
will include the analyses in their QA process. With the help of the Quamoco
quality model, we could efficiently aggregate and rate static analysis results.
However, we also encountered a partial mismatch with the opinions of the SMEs.
We conclude, that ASA and quality models can be a valuable and affordable
addition to the QA process of SMEs.

of a concave mobility corresponds essentially to the exclusion model that has
been discussed in \cite{Lag,CPAM,BGLa,ED}. We consider here the convex case
that includes for example the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) model and its

computations in \cite{BGL}. We consider then, both microscopically and
macroscopically, the limit of large external fields. Microscopically we discuss
some possible totally asymmetric limits of the KMP model. In one case the
totally asymmetric dynamics has a product invariant measure. Another possible
limit dynamics has instead a non trivial invariant measure for which we give a
duality representation. Macroscopically we show that the quasi-potentials of
KMP and KMPd, that for any fixed external field are non local, become local in
the limit. Moreover the dependence on one of the external reservoirs
disappears. For models having strictly positive quadratic mobilities we obtain
instead in the limit a non local functional having a structure similar to the

two accompanying gases, which behave oppositely to their liquids. The liquid

helps in achieving better output smoothness and generalization. However EMD is
computationally expensive.Moreover, solving EMD optimization problems usually
require complex techniques like lasso. These properties limit the applicability
of EMD-based approaches in large scale machine learning.
  We address in this work the difficulties facing incorporation of EMD-based
loss in deep learning frameworks. Additionally, we provide insight and novel
solutions on how to integrate such loss function in training deep neural
networks. Specifically, we make three main contributions: (i) we provide an
in-depth analysis of the fastest state-of-the-art EMD algorithm (Sinkhorn
Distance) and discuss its limitations in deep learning scenarios. (ii) we
derive fast and numerically stable closed-form solutions for the EMD gradient

faster convergence rate. We support our claims with experiments on real

is larger than two, the decision process dynamics qualitatively change. In this
work, we extend previous analyses of a value-sensitive decision-making

decision-making dynamics in the symmetric case of N equal-quality nests. Then,
we generalise our findings to a best-of-N decision scenario with one superior
nest and N-1 inferior nests, previously studied empirically in bees and ants.
Whereas previous binary models highlighted the crucial role of inhibitory
stop-signalling, the key parameter in our new analysis is the relative time
invested by swarm members in individual discovery and in signalling behaviours.
Our new analysis reveals conflicting pressures on this ratio in symmetric and
best-of-N decisions, which could be solved through a time-dependent signalling
strategy. Additionally, our analysis suggests how ecological factors
determining the density of suitable nest sites may have led to selective
pressures for an optimal stable signalling ratio.

gravitational effects, the flow is driven by an electric field, which is normal
to the substrate far from the flow. We study both the cases of overlying and
hanging films, where the liquid rests above and below the substrate
respectively. Starting with the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with
electrostatics, a fully nonlinear 2D Benney equation for the interfacial
dynamics is derived valid for waves that are long compared to the film
thickness. The weakly nonlinear evolution is governed by a Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation with a non-local term due to the electric field effect. The electric
field term is linearly destabilising and produces growth rates proportional to
the cube of the size of the wavenumber vector of the perturbations. It is found
that transverse gravitational instabilities are always present for hanging
films and lead to unboundedness of solutions even in the absence of electric
fields. For overlying films and a restriction on the strength of the electric
field, the equation possesses bounded solutions. This 2D equation is studied
numerically for the case of periodic boundary conditions in order to assess the
effects of inertia, electric field strength the dimensions of the periodic
domain. Rich dynamical behaviours are observed and classified in various
parameter windows. For subcritical Reynolds number flows, a sufficiently strong
electric field can promote non-trivial dynamics for some choices of domain
dimensions, leading to fully 2D evolutions for the interface. These dynamics
are also found to produce spatiotemporal chaos on sufficiently large domains.
For supercritical flows, such 2D chaotic dynamics emerge in the absence of a
field, and its presence enhances the amplitude of the fluctuations and broadens
their spectrum.

do not account for built environments like trees and man-made buildings. As an
economically viable option, crowd-sensed radio mapping acquires more accurate
local spectrum data from mobile users and constructs radio maps using spatial
models such as Kriging and Gaussian Process. Success of such crowd-sensing
systems presumes some incentive mechanisms to attract user participation. In
this work, we consider the scenario where the platform who constructs radio
environment maps makes one-time offers to selected users, and collects data
from those who accept the offers. We design pricing mechanisms based on
expected utility (EU) maximization, where EU captures the tradeoff between
radio mapping performance (location and data quality), crowd-sensing cost and
uncertainty in offer outcomes (i.e., possible expiration and rejection).
Specifically, we consider sequential offering, where one best price offer is
sent to the best user in each round, and batched offering, where a batch of
multiple offers are made in each round. For the later, we show that EU is
submodular in the discrete domain, and propose a mechanism that first fixes the
pricing rule and selects users based on Unconstrained Submodular Maximization
(USM); it then compares different pricing rules to find the best batch of
offers in each round. We show that USM-based user selection has provable
performance guarantee. Proposed mechanisms are evaluated and compared against
utility-maximization-based baseline mechanisms.

characterize the velocity spread of the absorbers, which is a method used
previously for a sample of MgII absorber--galaxy pairs. The absorption velocity
spread for OVI is more extended than MgII, which suggests that the two ions
trace differing components of the CGM. Also contrary to MgII, the OVI
absorption velocity spreads are similar regardless of galaxy color,
inclination, and azimuthal angle. This indicates that the kinematics of the
high ionization gas is not strongly influenced by the present star formation

tendency to be observed mainly along the projected galaxy major and minor axes
is likely due to varying ionization conditions and gas densities about the

whether any state can be determined from later outputs. For any field k we give
a presentation of FinRel_k in terms of generators of the free PROP of
signal-flow diagrams together with the equations that give FinRel_k its

do not fully account for wide variability in target-domain instances. In this
paper we propose a novel framework of learning data-dependent feature
transforms for scoring similarity between an arbitrary pair of source and

demonstration we design a specific algorithm under the proposed framework

penalties for feature displacement. We test our approach on several benchmark

  Different from previous works which usually minimize the penalty of
unsatisfied contracts and some other cost (e.g. representativeness), we propose
the novel consumption minimization model, in which the primary objective is to
minimize the user traffic consumed to satisfy all contracts. Under this model,
we develop a near optimal method to deliver ads for users. The main advantage
of our method lies in that it consumes nearly as least as possible user traffic
to satisfy all contracts, therefore more contracts can be accepted to produce
more revenue. It also enables the publishers to estimate how much user traffic
is redundant or short so that they can sell or buy this part of traffic in bulk
in the exchange market. Furthermore, it is robust with regard to priori
knowledge of user type distribution. Finally, the simulation shows that our
method outperforms the traditional state-of-the-art methods.

combinatorial auctions. Suppose that there is one seller who has indivisible
items and multiple buyers who want to purchase a combination of the items. The
seller wants to sell his items for the highest possible prices, and each buyer
wants to maximize his utility (i.e., valuation minus payment) as long as his
payment does not exceed his budget. The optimal pricing problem seeks a price
of each item and an assignment of items to buyers such that every buyer
achieves the maximum utility under the prices. The goal of the problem is to
maximize the total payment from buyers. In this paper, we consider the case
that the valuations are submodular. We show that the problem is computationally
hard even if there exists only one buyer. Then we propose approximation
algorithms for the unlimited budget case. We also extend the algorithm for the
limited budget case when there exists one buyer and multiple buyers collaborate

weaker condition than strong convexity, namely a quadratic growth condition
(QGC). However, the faster convergence of restarting APG method relies on the
potentially unknown constant in QGC to appropriately restart APG, which
restricts its applicability. We address this issue by developing a novel
adaptive gradient converging methods, i.e., leveraging the magnitude of
proximal gradient as a criterion for restart and termination. Our analysis
extends to a much more general condition beyond the QGC, namely the
H\""{o}lderian error bound (HEB) condition. {\it The key technique} for our
development is a novel synthesis of {\it adaptive regularization and a
conditional restarting scheme}, which extends previous work focusing on
strongly convex problems to a much broader family of problems. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that our results have important implication and applications in
machine learning: (i) if the objective function is coercive and semi-algebraic,
PG's convergence speed is essentially $o(\frac{1}{t})$, where $t$ is the total
number of iterations; (ii) if the objective function consists of an $\ell_1$,
$\ell_\infty$, $\ell_{1,\infty}$, or huber norm regularization and a convex
smooth piecewise quadratic loss (e.g., squares loss, squared hinge loss and
huber loss), the proposed algorithm is parameter-free and enjoys a {\it faster
linear convergence} than PG without any other assumptions (e.g., restricted
eigen-value condition). It is notable that our linear convergence results for

clouds nowadays provide more and more elaborated types of VMs, but have yet to
offer the most flexible dynamic VM assembly, which is partly due to the lack of
a mature mechanism for pricing tailor-made VMs on the spot. This work proposes
an efficient randomized auction mechanism based on a novel application of
smoothed analysis and randomized reduction, for dynamic VM provisioning and
pricing in geo-distributed cloud data centers. This auction, to the best of our

expectation, (ii) polynomial running time in expectation, and (iii)
$(1-\epsilon)$-optimal social welfare in expectation for resource allocation,
where $\epsilon$ can be arbitrarily close to 0. Our mechanism consists of three
modules: (1) an exact algorithm to solve the NP-hard social welfare
maximization problem, which runs in polynomial time in expectation, (2) a
perturbation-based randomized resource allocation scheme which produces a VM
provisioning solution that is $(1-\epsilon)$-optimal, and (3) an auction
mechanism that applies the perturbation-based scheme for dynamic VM
provisioning and prices the customized VMs using a randomized VCG payment, with
a guarantee in truthfulness in expectation. We validate the efficacy of the

without feedback, where the four transmitter-receiver links are intermittently
on-and-off, controlled by four Bernoulli random sequences which may be
arbitrarily correlated, subject to a symmetry assumption: The two direct-links
have the same level of burstiness, modeled by $\mathrm{Ber}(p_d)$, and so do
the cross-links, modeled by $\mathrm{Ber}(p_c)$. The sum DoF is fully
characterized in the regime where $\frac{p_c}{p_d}$ is small, i.e. below a
certain threshold, and is partially characterized in the other regime where
$\frac{p_c}{p_d}$ is above the threshold. The achievability is proved with a
combination of Han-Kobayashi strategy and interference alignment, which can
achieve strictly higher DoF than interference alignment alone. The converse
proof employs a channel-state-sequence pairing technique. We highlight that
burstiness of the channel disrupts the network topology, turning the MIMO X
channel into a network with time-varying topology. This fundamental difference
has striking ramifications. In particular, various interference alignment
schemes that achieve the DoF of non-bursty X channels are found to be
suboptimal when the channels become bursty. The reciprocity between the forward
and the reverse links is lost, and the sum DoF does not saturate when the ratio
of the transmitter and the receiver antennas exceeds $\frac{2}{3}$.

Amplitude flow} (SPARTA), to reconstruct a sparse signal from a small number of
magnitude-only measurements. It deals with what is also known as sparse phase
retrieval (PR), which is \emph{NP-hard} in general and emerges in many science
and engineering applications. Upon formulating sparse PR as an amplitude-based
nonconvex optimization task, SPARTA works iteratively in two stages: In stage
one, the support of the underlying sparse signal is recovered using an
analytically well-justified rule, and subsequently, a sparse
orthogonality-promoting initialization is obtained via power iterations
restricted on the support; and, in the second stage, the initialization is
successively refined by means of hard thresholding based gradient-type
iterations. SPARTA is a simple yet effective, scalable, and fast sparse PR
solver. On the theoretical side, for any $n$-dimensional $k$-sparse ($k\ll n$)
signal $\bm{x}$ with minimum (in modulus) nonzero entries on the order of
$(1/\sqrt{k})\|\bm{x}\|_2$, SPARTA recovers the signal exactly (up to a global
unimodular constant) from about $k^2\log n$ random Gaussian measurements with
high probability. Furthermore, SPARTA incurs computational complexity on the
order of $k^2n\log n$ with total runtime proportional to the time required to
read the data, which improves upon the state-of-the-art by at least a factor of
$k$. Finally, SPARTA is robust against additive noise of bounded support.
Extensive numerical tests corroborate markedly improved recovery performance
and speedups of SPARTA relative to existing alternatives.

calculated with lattice QCD is performed, with a particular focus on
characterizing the structure of the noise associated with quantum fluctuations.
The signal-to-noise problem in these correlation functions is shown, as long
suspected, to result from a sign problem. The log-magnitude and complex phase
are found to be approximately described by normal and wrapped normal
distributions respectively. Properties of circular statistics are used to
understand the emergence of a large time noise region where standard energy
measurements are unreliable. Power-law tails in the distribution of baryon
correlation functions, associated with stable distributions and ""Levy flights"",
are found to play a central role in their time evolution. A new method of
analyzing correlation functions is considered for which the signal-to-noise
ratio of energy measurements is constant, rather than exponentially degrading,
with increasing source-sink separation time. This new method includes an
additional systematic uncertainty that can be removed by performing an
extrapolation, and the signal-to-noise problem re-emerges in the statistics of
this extrapolation. It is demonstrated that this new method allows accurate
results for the nucleon mass to be extracted from the large-time noise region
inaccessible to standard methods. The observations presented here are expected
to apply to quantum Monte Carlo calculations more generally. Similar methods to

achieve higher output power and beam shaping. In this article, based on Talbot
effect, we show a new-type phase-locked array of mid-infrared quantum cascade
lasers with an integrated spatial- filtering Talbot cavity. All the arrays show
stable in-phase operation from the threshold current to full power current. The
beam divergence of the array device is smaller than that of a single-ridge
laser. We use the multi-slit Fraunhofer diffraction mode to interpret the
far-field radiation profile and give a solution to get better beam quality. The
maximum power is just about 5 times that of a single-ridge laser for
eleven-laser array device and 3 times for seven-laser array device. Considering
the great modal selection ability, simple fabricating process and the potential
for achieving better beam quality and smaller cavity loss, this new-type
phase-locked array may be a hopeful and elegant solution to get high power or
beam shaping.

requirements for big data software. But the security features of the big data

execute some of the existing security mechanisms before using them in the big
data world. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection technique
that understands and works according to the needs of big data systems. Our
proposed technique identifies program level anomalies using two methods - a
profiling method that models application behavior by creating process
signatures from control-flow graphs; and a matching method that checks for
coherence among the replica nodes of a big data system by matching the process
signatures. The profiling method creates a process signature by reducing the
control-flow graph of a process to a set of minimum spanning trees and then
creates a hash of that set. The matching method first checks for similarity in
process behavior by matching the received process signature with the local
signature and then shares the result with all replica datanodes for consensus.
Experimental results show only 0.8% overhead due to the proposed technique when
tested on the hadoop map-reduce examples in real-time.

the channel from the sender to one of the receivers is entanglement-breaking
and the channel from the sender to the other receiver is complementary to this
one. As such, this channel is a quantum generalization of a degraded broadcast
channel, which is well known in classical information theory. The first

the second is quantum communication to the stronger receiver and classical
communication to other, and the third is entanglement-assisted classical

performing a measurement channel on the stronger receiver's system, followed by
a preparation channel. As such, we can incorporate the classical output of the
measurement channel as an auxiliary variable and solve all three of the above
capacities for Hadamard broadcast channels, in this way avoiding known
difficulties associated with quantum auxiliary variables.

Rather than manipulating representations living on a single spatial grid, our
network layers operate across scale space, on a pyramid of grids. They consume
multigrid inputs and produce multigrid outputs; convolutional filters
themselves have both within-scale and cross-scale extent. This aspect is
distinct from simple multiscale designs, which only process the input at
different scales. Viewed in terms of information flow, a multigrid network
passes messages across a spatial pyramid. As a consequence, receptive field
size grows exponentially with depth, facilitating rapid integration of context.
Most critically, multigrid structure enables networks to learn internal
attention and dynamic routing mechanisms, and use them to accomplish tasks on
which modern CNNs fail.
  Experiments demonstrate wide-ranging performance advantages of multigrid. On
CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, flipping from a single grid to
multigrid within the standard CNN paradigm improves accuracy, while being
compute and parameter efficient. Multigrid is independent of other
architectural choices; we show synergy in combination with residual
connections. Multigrid yields dramatic improvement on a synthetic semantic
segmentation dataset. Most strikingly, relatively shallow multigrid networks
can learn to directly perform spatial transformation tasks, where, in contrast,
current CNNs fail. Together, our results suggest that continuous evolution of
features on a multigrid pyramid is a more powerful alternative to existing CNN
designs on a flat grid.

37 degree planetographic latitude. This rather surprising event, occurring at
an unexpected latitude and time, is the sixth ""Great White Spot"" (GWS) storm
observed over the last century and a half. Such GWS events are planetary-scale
atmospheric phenomena that dramatically change the typically bland appearance
of the planet. Occurring while the Cassini mission was on-orbit at Saturn, the
Great Storm of 2010-2011 was well-suited for intense scrutiny by the suite of
sophisticated instruments onboard the Cassini spacecraft as well by modern
instrumentation on ground-based telescopes and onboard the Hubble Space
Telescope. This GWS erupted on December 5th and generated a major dynamical
disturbance that affected the whole latitude band from 25 deg to 48 deg N.
Lightning events were prominent and detected as outbursts and flashes at both
optical and radio wavelengths. The activity of the head ceased after about
seven months, leaving the cloud structure and ambient winds perturbed. The tops
of the optically dense clouds of the storm's head reached the 300 mbar altitude
level where a mixture of ices was detected. The energetics of the frequency and
power of lightning, as well as the estimated power generated by the latent heat
released in the water-based convection, both indicate that the power released
for the storm was a significant fraction of Saturn's total radiated power. The
effects of the storm propagated into the stratosphere forming two warm
airmasses at the 0.5-5 mbar pressure level altitude. Related to the
stratospheric disturbance, hydrocarbon composition excesses were found. The
decades-long interval between storms is probably related to the insolation
cycle and the long radiative time constant of Saturn's atmosphere, and several
theories for temporarily storing energy have been proposed.

optical spectra. These galaxies contain a substantial young A-type stellar
component, but have only little ongoing star formation (SF). HI 21-cm line
emission is found in approximately half of the nearby E+A galaxies, indicating
that they contain a reservoir of gas that could fuel active SF. Here, we study
two HI-rich galaxies, which show a typical E+A spectrum at the centre and SF at
larger radii. We present new high spatial resolution radio interferometric
observations of the HI 21-cm emission line using the VLA and of the CO(1-0)
emission line using ALMA. We combine these data sets to predict the SFR and
show that it does not correlate well with the SFR derived from H alpha on
sub-kpc scales. We apply a recently developed statistical model for the small
scale behaviour of the SF relation to predict and interpret the observed
scatter. We find smoothly distributed, regularly rotating HI gas. The CO(1-0)
emission line is not detected for both galaxies. The derived upper limit on the
CO mass implies a molecular gas depletion time shorter than 20 Myr. However,
due to the low metallicity, the CO-to-H2 conversion factor is highly uncertain.
In the relations between the H alpha-based SFR and the HI mass, we observe a
substantial scatter we demonstrate results from small-number statistics of
independent star-forming regions on sub-kpc scales. This finding adds to the
existing literature reporting a scale dependence of the molecular SF relation,
showing that the atomic and molecular phases are both susceptible to the
evolutionary 'cycling' of individual regions. This suggests that the atomic gas
reservoirs host substantial substructure, which should be observable with
future high-resolution observations. (abridged)

Recent developments with microresonator-based platforms have enabled frequency

wavelengths of distinct high-quality-factor microcavities has hindered the
development of an on-chip dual comb source. Here, we report the first
simultaneous generation of two microresonator combs on the same chip from a

1.56 $\mu$m. We demonstrate low-noise operation of both frequency combs by
deterministically tuning into soliton mode-locked states using integrated
microheaters, resulting in narrow ($<$ 10 kHz) microwave beatnotes. We further
use one mode-locked comb as a reference to probe the formation dynamics of the
other comb, thus introducing a technique to investigate comb evolution without
auxiliary lasers or microwave oscillators. We demonstrate broadband high-SNR

captioning. To boost video captioning, we propose a novel transfer unit to
model the mutually correlated attributes learnt from images and videos.

being increasingly used to monitor human activities. Data acquired by the
hosted sensors are usually processed by machine-learning-based algorithms to
classify human activities. The success of those algorithms mostly depends on
the availability of training (labeled) data that, if made publicly available,
would allow researchers to make objective comparisons between techniques.
Nowadays, publicly available data sets are few, often contain samples from
subjects with too similar characteristics, and very often lack of specific
information so that is not possible to select subsets of samples according to
specific criteria. In this article, we present a new dataset of acceleration
samples acquired with an Android smartphone designed for human activity
recognition and fall detection. The dataset includes 11,771 samples of both
human activities and falls performed by 30 subjects of ages ranging from 18 to
60 years. Samples are divided in 17 fine grained classes grouped in two coarse
grained classes: one containing samples of 9 types of activities of daily
living (ADL) and the other containing samples of 8 types of falls. The dataset
has been stored to include all the information useful to select samples
according to different criteria, such as the type of ADL, the age, the gender,
and so on. Finally, the dataset has been benchmarked with four different
classifiers and with two different feature vectors. We evaluated four different
classification tasks: fall vs no fall, 9 activities, 8 falls, 17 activities and
falls. For each classification task we performed a subject-dependent and
independent evaluation. The major findings of the evaluation are the following:
i) it is more difficult to distinguish between types of falls than types of
activities; ii) subject-dependent evaluation outperforms the
subject-independent one

directly watch spins move in time and space at the microscopically relevant

currents can be detected by imaging spin accumulation, and how the
magnetisation dynamics in thin ferromagnetic films can be directly imaged. We
discuss how a direct look at the phenomena allows for a deeper understanding of

of the standard definition of a connection as an operator on the space of all
smooth sections. One aspect prominent in the diffeological context has to do
with the choice of an appropriate substitute for tangent vectors and smooth
vector fields, since there are not yet standard counterparts for these notions.
In this respect we opt for the simplest possibility; since there is an
established notion of the (pseudo-)bundle of differential forms on a
diffeological space, we take the corresponding dual pseudo-bundle to play the
role of the tangent bundle. Smooth vector fields are then smooth sections of
this dual pseudo-bundle; this is one reason why we devote a particular
attention to the space of smooth sections of an arbitrary diffeological vector
pseudo-bundle (one curiosity is that it might easily turn out to be
infinite-dimensional, even when the pseudo-bundle itself has a trivial
finite-dimensional vector bundle as the underlying map). We concentrate a lot
on how this space interacts with the gluing construction for diffeological
vector pseudo-bundles (described in [10]). We then deal with the same question
for the proposed notion of a diffeological connection.

potentials with incommensurate periods. For such systems, two limiting cases
have been thoroughly established. In the tight-binding limit, the
single-particle states in the lowest occupied band show a localization
transition, as the strength of the second potential is increased above a
certain threshold. In the continuous limit, when the tight-binding
approximation does not hold anymore, a mobility edge is found, whose position
in energy depends upon the strength of the second potential. Here, we study how
the crossover from the discrete to the continuum behavior occurs, and prove
that signatures of the localization transition and mobility edge clearly appear
in the generic many-body properties of the systems. Specifically, we evaluate
the momentum distribution, which is a routinely measured quantity in
experiments with cold atoms, and demonstrate that, even in the presence of
strong boson-boson interactions, the single particle mobility edge can be

PASCAL-VOC) reveals that the top-performing classifiers typically exhibit small
differences amongst themselves in terms of error rate/mAP. To better
differentiate the top performers, additional criteria are required. Moreover,
the (test) images, on which the performance scores are based, predominantly
contain fully visible objects. Therefore, `harder' test images, mimicking the
challenging conditions (e.g. occlusion) in which humans routinely recognize
objects, need to be utilized for benchmarking. To address the concerns
mentioned above, we make two contributions. First, we systematically vary the
level of local object-part content, global detail and spatial context in images
from PASCAL VOC 2010 to create a new benchmarking dataset dubbed PPSS-12.
Second, we propose an object-part based benchmarking procedure which quantifies
classifiers' robustness to a range of visibility and contextual settings. The
benchmarking procedure relies on a semantic similarity measure that naturally
addresses potential semantic granularity differences between the category
labels in training and test datasets, thus eliminating manual mapping. We use
our procedure on the PPSS-12 dataset to benchmark top-performing classifiers
trained on the ILSVRC-2012 dataset. Our results show that the proposed
benchmarking procedure enables additional differentiation among
state-of-the-art object classifiers in terms of their ability to handle missing
content and insufficient object detail. Given this capability for additional
differentiation, our approach can potentially supplement existing benchmarking
procedures used in object recognition challenge leaderboards.

of the particles at the contact line. In this work, we investigate the drying
of an aqueous colloidal drop surrounded by a hydrogel that is also evaporating.
We combine theoretical and experimental studies to understand how the
surrounding vapor concentration affects the particle deposit during the
constant radius evaporation mode. In addition to the common case of evaporation
on an otherwise dry surface, we show that in a configuration where liquid is
evaporating from a flat surface around the drop, the singularity of the
evaporative flux at the contact line is suppressed and the drop evaporation is
homogeneous. For both conditions, we derive the velocity field and we establish
the temporal evolution of the number of particles accumulated at the contact
line. We predict the growth dynamics of the stain and the drying timescales.
Thus, dry and wet conditions are compared with experimental results and we
highlight that only the dynamics is modified by the evaporation conditions, not
the final accumulation at the contact line.

relative entropy for states, we mathematically define and analyze the heat
production of free fermions within external potentials. More precisely, we
investigate the heat production of the non-autonomous C*-dynamical system
obtained from the fermionic second quantization of a discrete Schr\""odinger
operator with bounded static potential in presence of an electric field that is
time- and space-dependent. It is a first preliminary step towards a
mathematical description of transport properties of fermions from thermal
considerations. This program will be carried out in several papers. The regime
of small and slowly varying in space electric fields is important in this
context, and is studied the present paper. We use tree-decay bounds of the
$n$-point, $n\in 2\mathbb{N}$, correlations of the many-fermion system to
analyze this regime. We verify below the 1st law of thermodynamics for the
system under consideration. The latter implies, for systems doing no work, that
the heat produced by the electromagnetic field is exactly the increase of the
internal energy resulting from the modification of the (infinite volume) state
of the fermion system. The identification of heat production with an energy
increment is, among other things, technically convenient. We initially focus
our study on non-interacting (or free) fermions, but our approach will be later
applied to weakly interacting fermions.

the dynamic constraint contain an uncertain parameter. Since the distribution
of this uncertain parameter is not exactly known, the objective function is
taken as the worst-case expectation over a set of possible distributions of the

by the first two moments of the random variables involved. The optimal control
is found by minimizing the worst-case expectation over all possible
distributions in this set. If the distributions are discrete, the stochastic
min-max optimal control problem can be converted into a convensional optimal
control problem via duality, which is then approximated as a finite-dimensional
optimization problem via the control parametrization. We derive necessary
conditions of optimality and propose an algorithm to solve the approximation
optimization problem. The results of discrete probability distribution are then
extended to the case with one dimensional continuous stochastic variable by
applying the control parametrization methodology on the continuous stochastic
variable, and the convergence results are derived. A numerical example is
present to illustrate the potential application of the proposed model and the
effectiveness of the algorithm.

that users have periodic patterns in their movements. Also, they are influenced

the key particle is facing the dimple of the lock colloidal particle. The
preferred orientation $\phi_{eq}$ of the key-lock composite doublet relative to

of the positivity of the heat production, the real part of its Fourier

of $\mathcal{R}$, in accordance with Ohm's law in Fourier space. This finite
measure is the Fourier transform of a time-correlation function of current
fluctuations, i.e., the conductivity distribution satisfies Green-Kubo
relations. We additionally show that this measure can also be seen as the
boundary value of the Laplace-Fourier transform of a so-called quantum current
viscosity. The real and imaginary parts of conductivity distributions satisfy
Kramers-Kronig relations. At leading order, uniformly with respect to
parameters, the heat production is the classical work performed by electric
fields on the system in presence of currents. The conductivity measure is
uniformly bounded with respect to parameters of the system and it is never the
trivial measure $0\,\mathrm{d}\nu $. Therefore, electric fields generally
produce heat in such systems. In fact, the conductivity measure defines a
quadratic form in the space of Schwartz functions, the Legendre-Fenchel
transform of which describes the resistivity of the system. This leads to
Joule's law, i.e., the heat produced by currents is proportional to the
resistivity and the square of currents.

substrates in the thick film limit (100-500~\AA) as a function of film
thickness using polarization-dependent extended x-ray absorption fine structure
(EXAFS). All films investigated are phase-pure and of high quality with a sharp
interface between MnSi and Si. The investigated MnSi films are in a thickness
regime where the magnetic transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ assumes a
thickness-independent enhanced value of $\geq$43~K as compared with that of
bulk MnSi, where $T_\mathrm{c} \approx 29~{\rm K}$. A detailed refinement of
the EXAFS data reveals that the Mn positions are unchanged, whereas the Si
positions vary along the out-of-plane [111]-direction, alternating in
orientation from unit cell to unit cell. Thus, for thick MnSi films, the unit
cell volume is essentially that of bulk MnSi --- except in the vicinity of the
interface with the Si substrate (thin film limit). In view of the enhanced
magnetic transition temperature we conclude that the mere presence of the
interface, and its specific characteristics, strongly affects the magnetic
properties of the entire MnSi film, even far from the interface. Our analysis
provides invaluable information about the local strain at the MnSi/Si(111)
interface. The presented methodology of polarization dependent EXAFS can also
be employed to investigate the local structure of other interesting interfaces.

stars that experience hot-bottom burning. To this aim we use the PARSEC and
COLIBRI codes to compute the complete evolution, from the pre-main sequence up
to the termination of the TP-AGB phase, of a set of stellar models with initial
masses in the range $3.0\,M_{\odot} - 6.0\,M_{\odot}$, and metallicities
$Z_{\rm i}=0.0005$, $Z_{\rm i}=0.006$, and $Z_{\rm i} = 0.014$. We find that
the new LUNA measures have much reduced the nuclear uncertainties of the
$^{22}$Ne and $^{23}$Na AGB ejecta, which drop from factors of $\simeq 10$ to
only a factor of few for the lowest metallicity models. Relying on the most
recent estimations for the destruction rate of $^{23}$Na, the uncertainties
that still affect the $^{22}$Ne and $^{23}$Na AGB ejecta are mainly dominated
by evolutionary aspects (efficiency of mass-loss, third dredge-up, convection).
Finally, we discuss how the LUNA results impact on the hypothesis that invokes
massive AGB stars as the main agents of the observed O-Na anti-correlation in
Galactic globular clusters. We derive quantitative indications on the
efficiencies of key physical processes (mass loss, third dredge-up, sodium
destruction) in order to simultaneously reproduce both the Na-rich, O-poor
extreme of the anti-correlation, and the observational constraints on the CNO

generalization of the cross-entropy gradient step, which can be used in place
of the gradient in any gradient-based training method. The generalized gradient
is parameterized by a value that controls the sensitivity of the training
process to harder training examples. We tested our method on several benchmark

level of sensitivity to hard example is positively correlated with the depth of
the network. Moreover, the test prediction error obtained by our method is
generally lower than that of the vanilla cross-entropy gradient learner. We
therefore conclude that tunable sensitivity can be helpful for neural network

  Seeun William Umboh","Timing Matters: Online Dynamics in Broadcast Games",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A central question in algorithmic game theory is to measure the inefficiency
(ratio of costs) of Nash equilibria (NE) with respect to socially optimal
solutions. The two established metrics used for this purpose are price of
anarchy (POA) and price of stability (POS), which respectively provide upper
and lower bounds on this ratio. A deficiency of these metrics, however, is that
they are purely existential and shed no light on which of the equilibrium
states are reachable in an actual game, i.e., via natural game dynamics. This
is particularly striking if these metrics differ significantly, such as in
network design games where the exponential gap between the best and worst NE
states originally prompted the notion of POS in game theory (Anshelevich et
al., FOCS 2002). In this paper, we make progress toward bridging this gap by
studying network design games under natural game dynamics.
  First we show that in a completely decentralized setting, where agents
arrive, depart, and make improving moves in an arbitrary order, the
inefficiency of NE attained can be polynomially large. This implies that the
game designer must have some control over the interleaving of these events in
order to force the game to attain efficient NE. We complement our negative
result by showing that if the game designer is allowed to execute a sequence of
improving moves to create an equilibrium state after every batch of agent
arrivals or departures, then the resulting equilibrium states attained by the
game are exponentially more efficient, i.e., the ratio of costs compared to the
optimum is only logarithmic. Overall, our two results establish that in network
games, the efficiency of equilibrium states is dictated by whether agents are
allowed to join or leave the game in arbitrary states, an observation that
might be useful in analyzing the dynamics of other classes of games with
divergent POS and POA bounds.

posteriori (MAP) problem with sparsity priors on the gradients of the latent
image, and then alternatingly estimate the blur kernel and the latent image.
While several successful MAP based methods have been proposed, there has been
much controversy and confusion about their convergence, because sparsity priors
have been shown to prefer blurry images to sharp natural images. In this paper,
we revisit this problem and provide an analysis on the convergence of MAP based
approaches. We first introduce a slight modification to a conventional joint
energy function for blind deconvolution. The reformulated energy function
yields the same alternating estimation process, but more clearly reveals how
blind deconvolution works. We then show the energy function can actually favor
the right solution instead of the no-blur solution under certain conditions,
which explains the success of previous MAP based approaches. The reformulated
energy function and our conditions for the convergence also provide a way to
compare the qualities of different blur kernels, and we demonstrate its

measurement of the size distribution of small bubbles in a liquid - and hence
for reliable and automated image analysis. However, due to the strong mismatch
between the refractive index of a liquid and a gas, bubbles deform strongly the
path of light rays, rendering automated bubble size analysis a challenging
task. We show here how this challenge can be met using the fact that bubbles
act like inverted, spherical lenses with a curvature which is the inverse of
the bubble radius. The imaging properties of each bubble can then be used to
accurately determine the radius of the bubble upon imaging an object which can
be filtered easily by a computer. When bubbles are large enough to be deformed
under the influence of gravity, it is more appropriate to measure their size
after squeezing them between two narrowly spaced glass plates. We therefore
show here, how the analysis can be extended to this case; and how both
approaches can be combined to measure the size distributions of strongly
polydisperse foams containing simultaneously small (several 10s of micrometres)
and large bubbles (several 100s of micrometres).

different reaction channels. We start with the quasielastic and

emission channel which attracted a lot of attention in the last few years. We
review the main aspects of the different microscopic models for this channel by
discussing analogies and differences among them.The discussion is always driven

problem, with solution-dependent weights. To address outliers, the standard
least squares fit-to-data metric is replaced by the Talwar robust regression

a preconditioner is proposed to accelerate conjugate gradient Hessian solves.

of important applications in many fields. It is well known that this problem is

there exists $\bar{\lambda}>0$ such that the optimal solution of the

representing movements is in general quite large especially when full body
movements are considered. Furthermore, this feature vector evolves during the
movement performance so that a complete movement is fully represented by a
matrix M of size DxT , whose element M i, j represents the value of feature i
at timestamps j. Many studies have addressed dimensionality reduction
considering only the size of the feature vector lying in R D to reduce both the
variability of gestural sequences expressed in the reduced space, and the
computational complexity of their processing. In return, very few of these
methods have explicitly addressed the dimensionality reduction along the time
axis. Yet this is a major issue when considering the use of elastic distances
which are characterized by a quadratic complexity along the time axis. We
present in this paper an evaluation of straightforward approaches aiming at
reducing the dimensionality of the matrix M for each movement, leading to
consider both the dimensionality reduction of the feature vector as well as its
reduction along the time axis. The dimensionality reduction of the feature
vector is achieved by selecting remarkable joints in the skeleton performing
the movement, basically the extremities of the articulatory chains composing
the skeleton. The temporal dimen-sionality reduction is achieved using either a
regular or adaptive down-sampling that seeks to minimize the reconstruction
error of the movements. Elastic and Euclidean kernels are then compared through
support vector machine learning. Two data sets 1 that are widely referenced in
the domain of human gesture recognition, and quite distinctive in terms of
quality of motion capture, are used for the experimental assessment of the
proposed approaches. On these data sets we experimentally show that it is
feasible, and possibly desirable, to significantly reduce simultaneously the
size of the feature vector and the number of skeleton frames to represent body
movements while maintaining a very good recognition rate. The method proves to
give satisfactory results at a level currently reached by state-of-the-art
methods on these data sets. We experimentally show that the computational
complexity reduction that is obtained makes this approach eligible for
real-time applications.

memory utilisation without substantial degradation of lookup performance.
Cuckoo hashing is an efficient technique of creating hash tables with high
space utilisation and offer a guaranteed constant access time. We are given $n$
locations and $m$ items. Each item has to be placed in one of the $k\ge2$
locations chosen by $k$ random hash functions. By allowing more than one choice
for a single item, cuckoo hashing resembles multiple choice allocations
schemes. In addition it supports dynamically changing the location of an item
among its possible locations. We propose and analyse an insertion algorithm for
cuckoo hashing that runs in \emph{linear time} with high probability and in
expectation. Previous work on total allocation time has analysed breadth first
search, and it was shown to be linear only in \emph{expectation}. Our algorithm
finds an assignment (with probability 1) whenever it exists. In contrast, the
other known insertion method, known as \emph{random walk insertion}, may run
indefinitely even for a solvable instance. We also present experimental results
comparing the performance of our algorithm with the random walk method, also
for the case when each location can hold more than one item.
  As a corollary we obtain a linear time algorithm (with high probability and
in expectation) for finding perfect matchings in a special class of sparse
random bipartite graphs. We support this by performing experiments on a real
world large dataset for finding maximum matchings in general large bipartite
graphs. We report an order of magnitude improvement in the running time as

universal yet generally non-Poissonian long-time asymptotics for a broad
variety of transport processes. While Poisson-like asymptotics arise
generically in the presence of an effective repulsion in the immediate vicinity
of the target, a time-scale separation between direct and reflected indirect
trajectories gives rise to a universal proximity effect: Direct paths, heading
more or less straight from the point of release to the target, become typical
and focused, with a narrow spread of the corresponding first passage times.
Conversely, statistically dominant indirect paths exploring the system size
tend to be massively dissimilar. The initial distance to the target
particularly impacts gene regulatory or competitive stochastic processes, for
which often few binding events determine the regulatory outcome. The proximity

density. Second, we show that network performance in terms of coverage density
and area spectral efficiency can scale with the network density better than the
user performance does. Furthermore, we provide ordering results for both
coverage and average rate as a means to qualitatively compare different

progressions, whenever $|A|\geq (c_q q)^n$ for some constant $c_q>0$. After the
first version of our manuscript was uploaded in the arXiv, we learned from
Professors Jacob Fox and Terence Tao that our result is a special case of a
result of Fox and Lovasz [1, Theorem 3]. In fact, [1, Theorem 3] gives a much
better bound than ours. For example, when $q=3$, the lower bound given by Fox
and Lovasz is $|A|^{2}\cdot (|A|q^{-n})^{11.901}$, while our bound is
$|A|^{2}\cdot (|A|q^{-n})^{25.803}$. We thank Professors Jacob Fox and Terence
Tao for their helpful comments on our manuscript. [1] Jacob Fox, L\'aszl\'o

asymmetry in the universe. In current models of baryogenesis gravity plays a
secondary role, although the process is believed to have happened in the early
universe, under the influence of an intense gravitational field. In the present
work we resume Sakharov's original program for baryogenesis and propose a
central role for gravity in the process. This is achieved through a non-minimal
coupling (NMC) between the gravitational field and both the strong interaction
field and the quark fields. When in action, the present mechanism leads to
baryon number non-conservation and CP violation. Moreover, the NMC induces
reduced effective quark masses, which favours a first order QCD phase
transition. As a consequence, a baryon asymmetry can be attained in the
transition from the quark epoch to the hadron epoch.

reduces the maximum number of steps needed to converge to realizability

yield helpful GR(1) assumptions and prove the soundness of the results.

domain-specific texts processing tasks, such as machine translation,
information retrieval or sentiment analysis. However, there is still no
agreement on which methods are best suited for particular settings and,
moreover, there is no reliable comparison of already developed methods. We
believe that one of the main reasons is the lack of state-of-the-art methods
implementations, which are usually non-trivial to recreate. In order to address
these issues, we present ATR4S, an open-source software written in Scala that
comprises more than 15 methods for automatic terminology recognition (ATR) and
implements the whole pipeline from text document preprocessing, to term
candidates collection, term candidates scoring, and finally, term candidates
ranking. It is highly scalable, modular and configurable tool with support of
automatic caching. We also compare 10 state-of-the-art methods on 7 open
datasets by average precision and processing time. Experimental comparison
reveals that no single method demonstrates best average precision for all
datasets and that other available tools for ATR do not contain the best
methods.

The interaction is induced by the intraband hopping with a coupling parameter
of the order of the kinetic energy of electrons W which is much larger than the

color image. Despite the general success of the end-to-end learning paradigm,
top performing approaches employ a two-step solution consisting of a
Convolutional Network (ConvNet) for 2D joint localization and a subsequent
optimization step to recover 3D pose. In this paper, we identify the
representation of 3D pose as a critical issue with current ConvNet approaches
and make two important contributions towards validating the value of end-to-end
learning for this task. First, we propose a fine discretization of the 3D space
around the subject and train a ConvNet to predict per voxel likelihoods for
each joint. This creates a natural representation for 3D pose and greatly
improves performance over the direct regression of joint coordinates. Second,
to further improve upon initial estimates, we employ a coarse-to-fine
prediction scheme. This step addresses the large dimensionality increase and
enables iterative refinement and repeated processing of the image features. The
proposed approach outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on standard

information and computation. It unifies other approaches to measuring
information like Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon information. We define a
theory about information flow in deterministic computing based on three
fundamental observations: 1) Information is measured in logarithms, 2) All
countable sets contain the same amount of information and 3) Deterministic
computing does not create information. We analyze the flow of information
through computational processes: exactly, for primitive recursive functions and
elementary artithmetical operations and, under maximal entropy, for polynomial
functions and diophantine equations. Thus we get, by the MRDP-theorem, a theory
of flow of information for general computable functions. We prove some results
like the Fueter-P\'olya conjecture and the existence of an information
conserving enumeration of all finite sets of numbers. We also show that the
information flow in more complex derivatives of the primitive recursive
functions like addition and multiplication is not trivial: in particular
associativity is not information efficient for addition. Using the Cantor
pairing function we develop a universal measuring device for partitions of the
set of finite sets of numbers. We show that these sets can be enumerated by a
polynomial function when ordered by cardinality, but not when ordered by their
sums.

out that all the data available in Noncommutative Geometry (the algebra of

noncommutative generalization of Lorentzian orientable spacetimes of even
dimension with a spin structure. There are two main differences with spectral
triples: the existence of time-orientation 1-forms and the non-existence of a
distinguished C*-structure on the algebra. If a ""reconstructibility condition""
is met, different, yet isomorphic, C*-structures exist. We define a natural
notion of stable causality for spectral spacetimes. We give an example of a
commutative spectral spacetime which is a Wick rotated version of the spectral
triple that must be used in order to recover the usual notion of distance on a
finite graph through Connes' distance formula. We show that this spectral
spacetime is stably causal iff the time-orientation form induces no cycle. We
also provide a noncommutative example, the split Dirac structure, which we
study in some details. This structure is defined thanks to a discrete spinor
bundle on a finite graph, a discrete connection, and operators at the vertices
playing the role of gamma matrices. We give necessary and sufficient conditions
for the split Dirac structure to be a spectral spacetime. These includes the
natural analogues of the properties defining a spin connection in the
continuous case. However the split Dirac structure is not always
reconstructible: we prove that this is the case exactly when there exists a
parallel timelike vector field on the graph. Nonreconstructible split Dirac
structures furnish examples of spectral spacetimes which are not Wick rotations
of usual spectral triples, and are thus genuinely Lorentzian. Moreover we show
that the Dirac operator of the split Dirac structure is related to a Lorentzian
version of a discretization of the Dirac operator introduced earlier by

cosmological datasets on the total neutrino mass $M_\nu$ and on the mass
fractions carried by each of the mass eigenstates, after marginalizing over the
(unknown) neutrino mass ordering, either normal (NH) or inverted (IH). The
bounds take therefore into account the uncertainty related to our ignorance of
the mass hierarchy. This novel approach is carried out in the framework of
Bayesian analysis of a typical hierarchical problem. In this context, the
choice of the neutrino mass ordering is modeled via the discrete hyperparameter
$h_{type}$. The preference for either the NH or the IH scenarios is then
encoded in the posterior distribution of $h_{type}$ itself. Current CMB
measurements assign equal odds to the two hierarchies, and are thus unable to
distinguish between them. However, after the addition of BAO measurements, a
weak preference for NH appears, with odds of 4:3 from Planck temperature and
large-scale polarization in combination with BAO (3:2 if small-scale

upcoming CMB (COrE) and BAO surveys (DESI) may determine the neutrino mass
hierarchy at a high statistical significance if the mass is very close to the
minimal value allowed by oscillations, as for NH and $M_\nu=0.06$ eV there is a
9:1 preference of NH vs IH. On the contrary, if $M_\nu$ is of the order of 0.1
eV or larger, even future cosmological observations will be inconclusive. The
unbiased limit on $M_\nu$ we obtain with this innovative statistical strategy
is crucial for ongoing and planned neutrinoless double beta decay searches.

approach for communication over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast
channels. Inspired by the integer-forcing linear receiver for multiple-access
channels, it generalizes linear precoding by inducing an effective channel
matrix that is approximately integer, rather than approximately identity.
Combined with lattice encoding and a pre-inversion of the channel matrix at the
transmitter, the scheme has the potential to outperform any linear precoding
scheme, despite enjoying similar low complexity.
  In this paper, a specific IF precoding scheme, called diagonally-scaled exact
IF (DIF), is proposed and shown to achieve maximum spatial multiplexing gain.
For the special case of two receivers, in the high SNR regime, an optimal
choice of parameters is derived analytically, leading to an almost closed-form
expression for the achievable sum rate. In particular, it is shown that the gap
to the sum capacity is upper bounded by 0.27 bits for any channel realization.
For general SNR, a regularized version of DIF (RDIF) is proposed. Numerical
results for two receivers under Rayleigh fading show that RDIF can achieve
performance superior to optimal linear precoding and very close to the sum
capacity.

diodes (LEDs) strongly depends on wavelength, which is still not well
understood. In this paper, through differential carrier lifetime measurements
on commercialized near-UV, blue, and green LEDs, their different efficiency
droop behaviors are attributed to different carrier lifetimes, which are
prolonged as wavelength increases. This relationship between carrier lifetime
and indium composition of InGaN quantum well is believed owing to the
polarization-induced quantum confinement Stark effect. Long carrier lifetime
not only increases the probability of carrier leakage, but also results in high
carrier concentration in quantum well. In other words, under the same current
density, the carrier concentration in active region in near-UV LED is the
lowest while that in green one is the highest. If considering the efficiency
droop depending on carrier concentration, the behaviors of LEDs with different
wavelengths do not show any abnormality. The reason why the efficiency droop
becomes more serious under lower temperature can be also explained by this
model as well. Based on this result, the possible solutions to conquer
efficiency droop are discussed. It seems that decreasing the carrier lifetime
is a fundamental approach to solve the problem.

However, high-Tc superconductivity without hole carriers has been suggested in
FeSe single-layer films and intercalated iron-selenides, raising a fundamental
question whether iron pnictides and chalcogenides have different pairing
mechanisms. Here, we study the properties of electronic structure in the
high-Tc phase induced by pressure in bulk FeSe from magneto-transport
measurements and first-principles calculations. With increasing pressure, the
low-Tc superconducting phase transforms into high-Tc phase, where we find the
normal-state Hall resistivity changes sign from negative to positive,
demonstrating dominant hole carriers in striking contrast to other FeSe-derived
high-Tc systems. Moreover, the Hall coefficient is remarkably enlarged and the
magnetoresistance exhibits anomalous scaling behaviors, evidencing strongly
enhanced interband spin fluctuations in the high-Tc phase. These results in
FeSe highlight similarities with high-Tc phases of iron pnictides, constituting
a step toward a unified understanding of iron-based superconductivity.

spherical scatterers, placed in the vicinity of the focal volume, on the CARS
signal emitted by different objects (2{\mu}m diameter solid sphere, 2{\mu}m
diameter myelin cylinder and 2{\mu}m diameter myelin tube). We find that
distortions in the CARS signals arise not only from attenuation of the focal
field but also from scattering-induced changes in the spatial phase that
modifies the angular distribution of the CARS emission. Our simulations further
show that CARS signal attenuation can be minimized by using a high numerical
aperture condenser. Moreover, unlike the CARS intensity image, CARS images
formed by taking the ratio of CARS signals obtained using x- and y-polarized
input fields is relatively insensitive to the effects of spherical scatterers.
Our computational framework provide a mechanistic approach to characterizing
scattering-induced distortions in coherent imaging of turbid media and may
inspire bottom-up approaches for adaptive optical methods for image correction.
