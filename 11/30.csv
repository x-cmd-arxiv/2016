partition a big dataset to several subsets, so as to mine each subset in
memory. By this way, global patterns can be obtained by synthesizing all local
patterns discovered from these subsets. Another is the statistical sampling
method. This indicates that data partitioning should be an important strategy
for mining big data. This paper recalls our work on mining big data with a data
partitioning and shows some interesting findings among the local patterns

features due to its sub-wavelength nature on the surface and the periodic
variation of refractive index in the depth of the crystals. Here, we present a
detailed study of polarization anisotropy in light scattering associated with
three-dimensional photonic crystals with face centered cubic symmetry over a
broad wavelength and angular range. The polarization anisotropy leads to a
shift in the conventional Brewster angle defined for a planar interface with
certain refractive index. The observed shift in Brewster angle strongly depends
on the index contrast and lattice constant. Polarization-dependent stop gap
measurements are performed on photonic crystals with different index contrast
and lattice constants. These measurements indicate unique stop gap branching at
high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone of the photonic crystals. The
inherited stop gap branching is observed for TE polarization whereas that is
suppressed for TM polarization as a consequence of Brewster effect. Our results
have consequences in the polarized light-scattering from plasmonic structures
and dielectric meta-surfaces and are also useful in applications like
nano-scale polarization splitters and lasers.

other instruments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the methodology developed

for each type. In the linear case all prime ideals are completely prime but in
the cyclic case, which can only occur if $n$ is odd, there are prime ideals for
which the factors have arbitrarily large Goldie rank.

  Whiting","Mean-field limits for large-scale random-access networks",,,,,"math.PR math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We establish mean-field limits for large-scale random-access networks with
buffer dynamics and arbitrary interference graphs. While saturated-buffer
scenarios have been widely investigated and yield useful throughput estimates
for persistent sessions, they fail to capture the fluctuations in buffer
contents over time, and provide no insight in the delay performance of flows
with intermittent packet arrivals. Motivated by that issue, we explore in the
present paper random-access networks with buffer dynamics, where flows with
empty buffers refrain from competition for the medium. The occurrence of empty
buffers thus results in a complex dynamic interaction between activity states
and buffer contents, which severely complicates the performance analysis. Hence
we focus on a many-sources regime where the total number of nodes grows large,
which not only offers mathematical tractability but is also highly relevant
with the densification of wireless networks as the Internet of Things emerges.
We exploit time scale separation properties to prove that the properly scaled
buffer occupancy process converges to the solution of a deterministic
initial-value problem, and establish the existence and uniqueness of the
associated fixed point. This approach simplifies the performance analysis of
networks with huge numbers of nodes to a low-dimensional fixed-point
calculation. For the case of a complete interference graph, we demonstrate
asymptotic stability, provide a simple closed-form expression for the fixed
point, and prove interchange of the mean-field and steady-state limits. This
yields asymptotically exact approximations for key performance metrics, in
particular the stationary buffer content and packet delay distributions. The
methodological framework that we develop easily extends to various model
refinements as will be illustrated by several examples.

computationally hard task, often equivalent to relevant optimization problems.
Simulated annealing is a computational technique which explores the
configuration space by mimicking thermal noise. By slow cooling, it freezes the
system in a low-energy configuration, but the algorithm often gets stuck in
local minima. In quantum annealing, the thermal noise is replaced by
controllable quantum fluctuations, and the technique can be implemented in
modern quantum simulators. However, quantum-adiabatic schemes become
prohibitively slow in the presence of quasidegeneracies. Here we propose a
strategy which combines ideas from simulated annealing and quantum annealing.
In such hybrid algorithm, the outcome of a quantum simulator is processed on a
classical device. While the quantum simulator explores the configuration space
by repeatedly applying quantum fluctuations and performing projective
measurements, the classical computer evaluates each configuration and enforces
a lowering of the energy. We have simulated this algorithm for small instances
of the random energy model, showing that it potentially outperforms both
simulated thermal annealing and adiabatic quantum annealing. It becomes most
efficient for problems involving many quasi-degenerate ground states.

of static friction and the frictional interaction with the bottom surface. Our
study clearly demonstrates that interaction with the bottom surface plays a
crucial role in the formation of a pressure dip under the apex of a granular
pile. Basic to the theory of sandpiles are assumptions about the form of
scaling solutions and constitutive relations for cohesive-less hard grains for
which no typical scale is available. We find that these constitutive relations
must be modified; moreover for smaller friction coefficients and smaller piles
these scaling assumptions break down in the bulk of the sandpile due to the
presence of length scales that must be carefully identified. After identifying
the crucial scale we provide a predictive theory to when scaling solutions are
expected to break down. At the bottom of the pile the scaling assumption always
breaks, due to the different interactions with the bottom surface. The
consequences for measurable quantities like the pressure distribution and shear
stress at the bottom of the pile are discussed. For example one can have a
transition from no dip in the base-pressure to a dip at the center of the pile
as a function of the system size.

successfully generalized to three-fragment projectiles. The expression obtained

cross section, and accordingly generalizes the surrogate method to cases such

regularization parameter selection approach for linear least-squares discrete

singular-value structure of the ill-posed model matrix to acquire a better
solution. Unlike many other regularization algorithms that seek to minimize the
estimated data error, the proposed approach is developed to minimize the
mean-squared error of the estimator which is the objective in many typical
estimation scenarios. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated
by applying it to a large set of real-world discrete ill-posed problems.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms a set of
benchmark regularization methods in most cases. In addition, the approach also
enjoys the lowest runtime and offers the highest level of robustness amongst

transmission line with linear dispersion. We characterize this system by
studying the dynamics of a local system (emitter) driven by a coherent field

ANUROOP, has been developed in the finite volume framework using kinetic energy
preserving second order central differencing scheme for calculating fluxes, and
is compatible with hybrid grids. ANUROOP was verified and validated against
several test cases with Mach numbers ranging from 0.1 (Taylor-Green vortex) to
1.5 (compressible turbulent channel flow). The code was found to be robust and
stable, and the kinetic energy decay obeys the compressible Navier-Stokes

  A hybrid grid, with a high resolution hexahedral orthogonal mesh in the
boundary layer and unstructured (also hexahedral) elements in the rest of the

is approximately an order of magnitude higher than in previous simulations for
the same flow conditions and using similar numerical methods. The discrepancy

there is a phenomenological relation between the EMC effect and the effects of

$s$-set, if for every unit vector $e \in S^{1}$, some line $L_{e}$ parallel to
$e$ satisfies $$\dim_{\mathrm{H}} [K \cap L_{e}] \geq s.$$ The Furstenberg set
problem, introduced by T. Wolff in 1999, asks for the best lower bound for the
dimension of Furstenberg $s$-sets. Wolff proved that $\dim_{\mathrm{H}} K \geq
\max\{s + 1/2,2s\}$ and conjectured that $\dim_{\mathrm{H}} K \geq (1 + 3s)/2$.
The only known improvement to Wolff's bound is due to Bourgain, who proved in
2003 that $\dim_{\mathrm{H}} K \geq 1 + \epsilon$ for Furstenberg $1/2$-sets
$K$, where $\epsilon > 0$ is an absolute constant. In the present paper, I
prove a similar $\epsilon$-improvement for all $1/2 < s < 1$, but only for
packing dimension: $\dim_{\mathrm{p}} K \geq 2s + \epsilon$ for all Furstenberg
$s$-sets $K \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$, where $\epsilon > 0$ only depends on $s$.
  The proof rests on a new incidence theorem for finite collections of planar
points and tubes of width $\delta > 0$. As another corollary of this theorem, I
obtain a small improvement for Kaufman's estimate from 1968 on the dimension of
exceptional sets of orthogonal projections. Namely, I prove that if $K \subset
\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a linearly measurable set with positive length, and $1/2 < s
< 1$, then $$\dim_{\mathrm{H}} \{e \in S^{1} : \dim_{\mathrm{p}} \pi_{e}(K)
\leq s\} \leq s - \epsilon$$ for some $\epsilon > 0$ depending only on $s$.
Here $\pi_{e}$ is the orthogonal projection onto the line spanned by $e$.

effort to collect accurate measurements of a value of interest over time. At
each time, the sensor is asked to report his observation to the operator, and
is compensated based on the accuracy of this observation. Since both the effort
and observation are private information for the sensor, a naive payment scheme
which compensates the sensor based only on his self-reported values will lead
to both shirking and falsification of outcomes by the sensor. We consider the
problem of designing an appropriate compensation scheme to incentivize the
sensor to at once exert costly effort and truthfully reveal the resulting
observation.
  To this end, we formulate the problem as a repeated game and propose a
compensation scheme that employs stochastic verification by the operator
coupled with a system of assigning reputation to the sensor. In particular, our
proposed payment scheme compensates the sensor based on both the effort in the
current period as well as the history of past behavior. We show that by using
past behavior in determining present payments, the operator can both
incentivize higher effort as well as more frequent truthtelling by the sensor
and decrease the required verification frequency.

were detected using a rule based image processing method, where no feature

results on flat space, and novel observations concerning the entropy.
Remarkably, like in the case with negative cosmological constant, we find that
the asymptotic symmetries for locally flat spacetimes with a horizon are
governed by infinite copies of the Heisenberg algebra that generate soft hair
descendants. It is also shown that the generators of the three-dimensional
Bondi-Metzner-Sachs algebra arise from composite operators of the affine u(1)
currents through a twisted Sugawara-like construction. We then discuss entropy
macroscopically, thermodynamically and microscopically and discover that a
microscopic formula derived recently for boundary conditions associated to the
Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy fits perfectly our results for entropy and ground
state energy. We conclude with a comparison to related approaches.

statistical relation between the distribution of galaxies and matter. We focus
on large scales where cosmic density fields are quasi-linear. On these scales,
the clustering of galaxies can be described by a perturbative bias expansion,
and the complicated physics of galaxy formation is absorbed by a finite set of
coefficients of the expansion, called bias parameters. The review begins with a
detailed derivation of this very important result, which forms the basis of the
rigorous perturbative description of galaxy clustering, under the assumptions
of General Relativity and Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions. Key
components of the bias expansion are all leading local gravitational
observables, which include the matter density but also tidal fields and their
time derivatives. We hence expand the definition of local bias to encompass all
these contributions. This derivation is followed by a presentation of the
peak-background split in its general form, which elucidates the physical
meaning of the bias parameters, and a detailed description of the connection
between bias parameters and galaxy statistics. We then review the excursion-set
formalism and peak theory which provide predictions for the values of the bias
parameters. In the remainder of the review, we consider the generalizations of
galaxy bias required in the presence of various types of cosmological physics
that go beyond pressureless matter with adiabatic, Gaussian initial conditions:
primordial non-Gaussianity, massive neutrinos, baryon-CDM isocurvature
perturbations, dark energy, and modified gravity. Finally, we discuss how the
description of galaxy bias in the galaxies' rest frame is related to clustering
statistics measured from the observed angular positions and redshifts in actual
galaxy catalogs.

power grid customers for incentive-based demand response. We consider a setting
in which the customers are asked to reduce their electricity consumption by the
DRA and they are compensated for this demand curtailment. However, given that
the DRA must supply every customer with as much power as she desires, a
strategic customer can temporarily increase her base load in order to report a
larger reduction as part of the demand response event. The DRA wishes to
incentivize the customers both to make costly effort to reduce load and to not
falsify the reported load reduction. We model this problem as a contract design
problem and present a solution. The proposed contract consists of two parts: a
part that depends on (the possibly inflated) load reduction as measured by the
DRA and another that provides a share of the profit that accrues to the DRA
through the demand response event to the customers. Since this profit accrues
due to the total load reduction because of the actions taken by all the
customers, the interaction among the customers also needs to be carefully
included in the contract design. The contract design and its properties are
presented and illustrated through examples.

gamma bands), though the topographies of these synchrostates differ for
different subject groups with different pathological conditions. The
inter-synchrostate switching follows a well-defined sequence capturing the
underlying inter-electrode phase relation dynamics in stimulus- and

microstate exhibiting stable potential maps over the scalp. However, here we

simple bijection with lattice paths weakly above a lattice path

designed for load frequency control (LFC) of two interconnected power systems.
Conflicting time domain design objectives are considered in a multi objective
optimization (MOO) based design framework to design the gains and the
fractional differ-integral orders of the FOPID controllers in the two areas.
Here, we explore the effect of augmenting two different chaotic maps along with
the uniform random number generator (RNG) in the popular MOO algorithm - the
Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Different measures of
quality for MOO e.g. hypervolume indicator, moment of inertia based diversity
metric, total Pareto spread, spacing metric are adopted to select the best set
of controller parameters from multiple runs of all the NSGA-II variants (i.e.
nominal and chaotic versions). The chaotic versions of the NSGA-II algorithm
are compared with the standard NSGA-II in terms of solution quality and
computational time. In addition, the Pareto optimal fronts showing the
trade-off between the two conflicting time domain design objectives are
compared to show the advantage of using the FOPID controller over that with
simple PID controller. The nature of fast/slow and high/low noise amplification
effects of the FOPID structure or the four quadrant operation in the two
inter-connected areas of the power system is also explored. A fuzzy logic based
method has been adopted next to select the best compromise solution from the
best Pareto fronts corresponding to each MOO comparison criteria. The time
domain system responses are shown for the fuzzy best compromise solutions under
nominal operating conditions. Comparative analysis on the merits and de-merits
of each controller structure is reported then. A robustness analysis is also
done for the PID and the FOPID controllers.

introducing suitable methods to overcome the ensuing conceptual and
computational issues, we calculate the power spectrum $P_{\mathcal{R}}(k)$ and
the spectral index $n_s(k)$ of primordial curvature perturbations. These
results generalize the previous work in loop quantum cosmology which focused on
those states which were known to remain sharply peaked throughout the Planck
regime. Surprisingly, even though the fluctuations we now consider are large,
their presence does not add new features to the final $P_{\mathcal{R}}(k)$ and
$n_s(k)$: Within observational error bars, their effect is degenerate with a
different freedom in the theory, namely the number of \emph{pre-inflationary}
e-folds $N_{{\rm B}\,\star}$ between the bounce and the onset of inflation.
Therefore, with regard to observational consequences, one can simulate the
freedom in the choice of states with large fluctuations in the Planck era using
the simpler, sharply peaked states, simply by allowing for different values of
$N_{{\rm B}\,\star}$.

used to estimate arrival times and ground velocities at the gravitational-wave

within a factor of 5 of measured values. The error in both arrival time and
ground-motion prediction introduced by using preliminary, rather than final,

validity of the calculated expressions by showing that they satisfy a family of

relations abstractly, we derive a partial differential system which involves a
natural action of cyclic groups of order two, three and four and a flow in

ingredients of our calculations, which come from a rearrangement lemma and
relations between the derivatives up to order four of the conformal factor and

generating function of the Bernoulli numbers and its multiplicative inverse. We
then shed light on the significance of exponential polynomials and their smooth

engage in joint visual attention, which is essential for establishing social

others in lifelike scenes, when they can move their heads and eyes freely, and
what are the sources of information for the underlying perceptual processes?
These questions pose a challenge from both empirical and computational
perspectives, due to the complexity of the visual input in real-life
situations. Here we measure empirically human accuracy in perceiving the gaze
direction of others in lifelike scenes, and study computationally the sources
of information and representations underlying this cognitive capacity. We show
that humans perform better in face-to-face conditions compared with recorded
conditions, and that this advantage is not due to the availability of input
dynamics. We further show that humans are still performing well when only the
eyes-region is visible, rather than the whole face. We develop a computational
model, which replicates the pattern of human performance, including the finding
that the eyes-region contains on its own, the required information for
estimating both head orientation and direction of gaze. Consistent with
neurophysiological findings on task-specific face regions in the brain, the
learned computational representations reproduce perceptual effects such as the
Wollaston illusion, when trained to estimate direction of gaze, but not when

applied (causing the electrical signal). By using different discriminant
analysis based classification techniques, we successfully establish that there
is enough information in the raw electrical signal to classify the stimuli. In
the process, we also propose two standard features which consistently give good
classification results for three types of stimuli - Sodium Chloride (NaCl),
Sulphuric Acid (H2SO4) and Ozone (O3). This may facilitate reduction in the
complexity involved in computing all the features for online classification of
similar external stimuli in future.

explore the transients that result from the dynamic ejecta and those from
different types of wind outflows. Based on full nuclear network simulations we
calculate the resulting light curves in different wavelength bands. We
scrutinize the robustness of the results by comparing a) two different nuclear
reaction networks and b) two macronova models. We explore in particular how
sensitive the results are to the production of alpha-decaying trans-lead
nuclei. We compare two frequently used mass models: the Finite-Range Droplet
Model (FRDM) and the nuclear mass model of Duflo and Zuker (DZ31). We find that
the abundance of alpha-decaying trans-lead nuclei has a significant impact on
the observability of the resulting macronovae. For example, the DZ31 model
yields considerably larger abundances resulting in larger heating rates and
thermalization efficiencies and therefore predicts substantially brighter
macronova transients. We find that the dynamic ejecta from NSNS models can
reach peak K-band magnitudes in excess of -15 while those from NSBH cases can
reach beyond -16. Similar values can be reached by some of our wind models.
Several of our models (both wind and dynamic ejecta) yield properties that are
similar to the transient that was observed in the aftermath of the short GRB

(energy production per unit time) increases slower than organisms' mass. When
this phenomenon is considered across different species, it is called
interspecific allometric scaling, whose causes are unknown. We argue that the
cause of interspecific allometric scaling is the total effect of physiological
and adaptation mechanisms inherent to organisms composing a food chain.
Together, the workings of these mechanisms are united by a primary goal of any
living creature - its successful reproduction. This primary necessity of each
organism and of the entire food chain is that common denominator, to which all
organisms adjust their metabolic rates. In this article, we consider
unicellular organisms, while the second paper studies multicellular organisms
and the entire concept in more detail. Here, using the proposed concepts and
experimentally verified growth models of five different unicellular organisms,
we obtain close to experimental findings values of allometric exponents of
0.757 for the end of growth and 0.853 for the beginning of growth. These
results comply with experimental observations and prove our theory that the
requirement of successful reproduction within the food chain is an important
factor shaping interspecific allometric scaling.

rotation of stars when modes are only weakly affected by rotation using
perturbative methods. Such methods cannot be applied to rapidly rotating stars,
which exhibit complex oscillation spectra. In this context, the so-called
traditional approximation, which neglects the terms associated with the
latitudinal component of the rotation vector, describes modes that are strongly
affected by rotation. This approximation is sometimes used for interpreting
asteroseismic data, however, its domain of validity is not established yet.
  Aims. We aim at deriving analytical prescriptions for period spacings of
low-frequency gravity modes strongly affected by rotation through the full
Coriolis acceleration, which can be used to probe stellar internal structure
and rotation.
  Methods. We approximated the asymptotic theory of gravito-inertial waves in
uniformly rotating stars using ray theory described in a previous paper in the
low-frequency regime, where waves are trapped near the equatorial plane. We put
the equations of ray dynamics into a separable form and used the EBK
quantisation method to compute modes frequencies from rays.
  Results. Two spectral patterns that depend on stratification and rotation are
predicted within this new approximation: one for axisymmetric modes and one for
non-axisymmetric modes.
  Conclusions. The detection of the predicted patterns in observed oscillation
spectra would give constraints on internal rotation and chemical stratification
of rapidly rotating stars exhibiting gravity modes, such as $\gamma$ Doradus,
SPB, or Be stars. The obtained results have a mathematical form that is similar
to that of the traditional approximation, but the new approximation takes the
full Coriolis, which allows for propagation near the centre, and centrifugal
accelerations into account.

of descriptive statistics like mean ({\mu}), standard deviation ({\sigma}),
coefficient of variation (CV = {\sigma}/{\mu}), skewness ({\gamma}) and
kurtosis (\{beta}) in phase-space diagrams are studied for a sliding window of
10 beats of ECG signal using the box-counting technique. Subsequently, a hybrid
prediction index which is composed of a weighted sum of CV and kurtosis has
been proposed for predicting the impending arrhythmia before its actual
occurrence. The early diagnosis involves crossing the upper bound of a hybrid
index which is capable of predicting an impending arrhythmia 356 ECG beats, on
average (with 192 beats standard deviation) before its onset when tested with
32 VA patients (both with and without VPBs). The early diagnosis result is also

(DNS), the Forward In Time (FIT) and Backward In Time (BIT) Probability Density
Functions (PDFs) of the separation of inertial particle-pairs in isotropic
turbulence. In agreement with our earlier study (Bragg et al., Phys. Fluids 28,
013305 (2016)), where we compared the FIT and BIT mean-square separations, we
find that inertial particles separate much faster BIT than FIT, with the
strength of the irreversibility depending upon the final/initial separation of
the particle-pair and their Stokes number $St$. However, we also find that the
irreversibility shows up in subtle ways in the behavior of the full PDF that it
does not in the mean-square separation. In the theory, we derive new
predictions, including a prediction for the BIT/FIT PDF for ${St\geq O(1)}$,
and for final/initial separations in the dissipation regime. The prediction
shows how caustics in the particle relative velocities in the dissipation range
affect the scaling of the pair-separation PDF, leading to a PDF with an
algebraically decaying tail. The predicted functional behavior of the PDFs is
universal, in that it does not depend upon the level of intermittency in the
underlying turbulence. We also analyze the pair-separation PDFs for fluid
particles at short-times, and construct theoretical predictions using the
multifractal formalism to describe the fluid relative velocity distributions.
The theoretical and numerical results both suggest that the extreme events in
the inertial particle-pair dispersion at the small-scales are dominated by
their non-local interaction with the turbulent velocity field, rather than due
to the strong dissipation range intermittency of the turbulence itself...

Landau level coexists with a number of conventional non-chiral levels. Disorder
scattering mixes these topologically different modes leading to peculiar
localization effects. We derive the average conductance as well as the full

Remarkably, we find that localization of the non-chiral modes is greatly
enhanced in a strong magnetic field with the typical localization length
scaling as $1/B$. Technically, we use the non-linear sigma-model formalism with

antiferromagnetic order. Typical settings for such problems arise when
itinerant fermions are also present. In this work, we develop a theoretical
framework for addressing such competing orders in an itinerant system,
described by Dirac fermions strongly coupled to an O(3) nonlinear sigma model.
We focus on two spatial dimensions, where upon disordering the
antiferromagnetic order by quantum fluctuations the singular tunneling events
also known as (anti)hedgehogs can nucleate competing singlet orders in the
paramagnetic phase. In the presence of an isolated hedgehog configuration of
the nonlinear sigma model field, we show that the fermion determinant vanishes
as the dynamic Euclidean Dirac operator supports fermion zero modes of definite
chirality. This provides a topological mechanism for suppressing the tunneling
events. Using the methodology of quantum chromodynamics, we evaluate the
fermion determinant in the close proximity of magnetic quantum phase
transition, when the antiferromagnetic order parameter field can be described
by a dilute gas of hedgehogs and antihedgehogs. We show how the precise nature
of emergent singlet order is determined by the overlap between dynamic fermion
zero modes of opposite chirality, localized on the hedgehogs and antihedgehogs.
For a Kondo-Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, we demonstrate the
competition between spin Peierls order and Kondo singlet formation, thereby
elucidating its global phase diagram. We also discuss other physical problems

field is expected to pervade its debris. In this paper, we study this process
via smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the disruption and
early debris evolution including the stellar magnetic field. As the gas
stretches into a stream, we show that the magnetic field evolution is strongly
dependent on its orientation with respect to the stretching direction. In
particular, an alignment of the field lines with the direction of stretching
induces an increase of the magnetic energy. For disruptions happening well
within the tidal radius, the star compression causes the magnetic field
strength to sharply increase by an order of magnitude at the time of pericentre
passage. If the disruption is partial, we find evidence for a dynamo process
occurring inside the surviving core due to the formation of vortices. This
causes an amplification of the magnetic field strength by a factor of $\sim
10$. However, this value represents a lower limit since it increases with
numerical resolution. For an initial field strength of 1 G, the magnetic field
never becomes dynamically important. Instead, the disruption of a star with a
strong 1 MG magnetic field produces a debris stream within which magnetic
pressure becomes similar to gas pressure a few tens of hours after disruption.
If the remnant of one or multiple partial disruptions is eventually fully
disrupted, its magnetic field could be large enough to magnetically power the
relativistic jet detected from Swift J1644+57. Magnetized streams could also be
significantly thickened by magnetic pressure when it overcomes the confining
effect of self-gravity.

this solution holds is fleetingly narrow, implying that much of the collapse
proceeds non-self-similarly. We show that our solutions can naturally
incorporate turbulent pressure support, and we investigate the evolution of
overdensities -- potentially generated by such turbulence -- as the collapse
proceeds. Finally, we analyze the evolution of the angular velocity and
magnetic fields in the limit that their dynamical influence is small, and we

bottom-heavy stellar initial mass function (IMF) compared to the IMF of the
Milky Way. Here we study the radial variation of the IMF within such galaxies,
using a combination of high quality Keck spectroscopy and a new suite of
stellar population synthesis models that cover a wide range in metallicity. As
in the previous studies in this series, the models are fitted directly to the
spectra and treat all elemental abundance ratios as free parameters. Using
newly obtained spectroscopy for six galaxies, including deep data extending to
~1Re for the galaxies NGC1407, NGC1600, and NGC2695, we find that the IMF
varies strongly with galactocentric radius. For all six galaxies the IMF is
bottom-heavy in the central regions, with average mass-to-light ratio
""mismatch"" parameter a~2.5 at R=0. The IMF rapidly becomes more bottom-light
with increasing radius, flattening off near the Milky Way value (a~1.1) at
R>0.4Re. A consequence is that the luminosity-weighted average IMF depends on
the measurement aperture: within R=Re we find <a>=1.3-1.5, consistent with
recent lensing and dynamical results from SLACS and ATLAS-3D. Our results are
also consistent with several earlier studies that were based on analyses of
radial gradients of line indices. The observed IMF gradients support galaxy
formation models in which the central regions of massive galaxies had a
different formation history than their outer parts. Finally, we make use of the

NB393 = 26.4 mag at the 5$\sigma$ level, and 56 H$\alpha$ emitters come from

measure the individual/volumetric Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction by comparing the
observed Ly$\alpha$ luminosity/luminosity density to the extinction-corrected
H$\alpha$ luminosity/luminosity density. We revisit the extinction correction
for H$\alpha$ emitters using the Galactic extinction law with the color excess
for nebular emission. We also adopt the Calzetti extinction law together with
an identical color excess for stellar and nebular regions to explore how the
uncertainties in extinction correction affect our results. In both cases, an
anti-correlation between the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction and dust attenuation is
found among the LAHAEs, suggesting that dust absorption is responsible for the
suppression of the escaping Ly$\alpha$ photons. However, the estimated
Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction of individual LAHAEs varies up to ~3 percentage
points between the two methods of extinction correction. We find the global
Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction at $z=2.24$ to be ($3.7\pm1.4$)% in the ECDFS. The
variation in the color excess of the extinction causes a discrepancy of ~1

fitting the inferred DM mass to a generalised NFW profile, we find that cores

necessarily preferred. Interestingly, we find that the results for the bulge

heavily affects the determination of the DM distribution in the bulge region,
which is gravitationally dominated by baryons, adding up to the uncertainty on
its normalization. The combination of the two hinders the actual possibility to
infer sound conclusions about the distribution of DM in the region of the

evidence to suggest that they are intimately connected with the appearance of

contribution explains that these emergent phenomena are expressed with
particular force in the partonic structure of hadrons, e.g. in valence-quark
parton distribution amplitudes and functions, and, consequently, in numerous
hadronic observables, so that we are now in a position to exhibit the

uncertainties and correlations among different observables. We present detailed
comparisons of high- and low-Z models against different ensembles of solar

0.9$\sigma$ and 3.0$\sigma$ for high- and low-Z models respectively. These
results show that: high-Z models agree well with solar data but have a
systematic problem right below the bottom of the convective envelope linked to
steepness of molecular weight and temperature gradients, and that low-Z models
lead to a much more general disagreement with solar data. We also show that,

sample of 27 intermediate-redshift galaxies. The sample comprises 13 massive
quiescent galaxies at z=0.40-0.73 probed by QSO sightlines at projected
distances d=3-400 kpc, and 14 star-forming galaxies at z=0.10-1.24 probed by
QSO sightlines at d=8-163 kpc. The main goal of this study is to examine the
radial profiles of the gas-phase Fe/{\alpha} ratio in galaxy halos based on the
observed Fe II to Mg II column density ratios. Because Mg+ and Fe+ share
similar ionization potentials, the relative ionization correction is small in
moderately ionized gas and the observed ionic abundance ratio N(Fe II)/N(Mg II)
places a lower limit to the underlying (Fe/Mg) elemental abundance ratio. For
quiescent galaxies, a median and dispersion of log <N(Fe II)/N(Mg II)>
=-0.06+/-0.15 is found at d<~60 kpc, which declines to log <N(Fe II)/N(Mg II)>
<-0.3 at d>~100 kpc. On the other hand, star-forming galaxies exhibit log <N(Fe
II)/N(Mg II)> =-0.25+/-0.21 at d<~60 kpc and log <N(Fe II)/N(Mg II)>
=-0.9+/-0.4 at larger distances. Including possible differential dust depletion
or ionization correction would only increase the inferred (Fe/Mg) ratio. The
observed N(FeII)/N(Mg II) implies super-solar Fe/{\alpha} ratios in the inner
halo of quiescent galaxies. An enhanced Fe abundance indicates a substantial
contribution by Type Ia supernovae in the chemical enrichment, which is at
least comparable to what is observed in the solar neighborhood or in
intracluster media but differs from young star-forming regions. In the outer
halos of quiescent galaxies and in halos around star-forming galaxies, however,
the observed N(Fe II)/N(Mg II) is consistent with an {\alpha}-element enhanced
enrichment pattern, suggesting a core-collapse supernovae dominated enrichment
history.

optimal state feedback control via Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). As further
steps of performance improvement of the missile attitude control system, the
LTR and LQI schemes are applied to increase the stability margins and guarantee
set-point tracking performance respectively, while also preserving the

showed that a power-law MF, as commonly seen among young cluster systems, would
evolve by dynamical processes over a Hubble time into a peaked MF with a shape
very similar to the observed GCMF in the Milky Way and other galaxies. To
simplify the calculations, the semi-analytical FZ01 model adopted the
""classical"" theory of stellar escape from clusters, and neglected variations in
the $M/L$ ratios of clusters. Kruijssen & Portegies Zwart (2009, hereafter
KPZ09) modified the FZ01 model to include ""retarded"" and mass-dependent stellar
escape, the latter causing significant $M/L$ variations. KPZ09 asserted that
their model was compatible with observations whereas the FZ01 model was not. We
show here that this claim is not correct; the FZ01 and KPZ09 models fit the
observed Galactic GCLF equally well. We also show that there is no detectable
correlation between $M/L$ and $L$ for GCs in the Milky Way and Andromeda
galaxies, in contradiction with the KPZ09 model. Our comparisons of the FZ01

at rates approaching the classical limit for high-mass clusters, as expected on
theoretical grounds.

properties of matter at supra-nuclear densities. Thermal emission during
thermonuclear X-ray bursts from NSs in low-mass X-ray binaries provides a
unique opportunity to study NS parameters, because of the high fluxes, large
luminosity variations and the related changes in the spectral properties. The
standard cooling tail method uses hot NS atmosphere models to convert the
observed spectral evolution during cooling stages of X-ray bursts to the
Eddington flux F_Edd and the stellar angular size \Omega. These are then
translated to the constraints on the NS mass M and radius R. Here we present
the improved, direct cooling tail method that generalises the standard
approach. First, we adjust the cooling tail method to account for the
bolometric correction to the flux. Then, we fit the observed dependence of the
blackbody normalization on flux with a theoretical model directly on the M-R
plane by interpolating theoretical dependences to a given gravity, hence
ensuring only weakly informative priors for M and R instead of F_Edd and
\Omega.
  The direct cooling method is demonstrated using a photospheric radius
expansion burst from SAX J1810.8--2609, which has happened when the system was
in the hard state. Comparing to the standard cooling tail method, the
confidence regions are shifted by 1 sigma towards larger radii, giving
R=11.5-13.0 km at M=1.3-1.8 M_sun for this NS.

disk-wide, ionized gas inflow toward the disk. This inflow is most likely
multi-phase as the redshifted components can also be observed in ions with
lower ionization states (e.g., S II, P II, Fe II, Si II). Kinematic modeling of
the inflow is consistent with an accreting layer at the disk-halo interface of
M33, which has an accretion velocity of 110$^{+15}_{-20}$ km s$^{-1}$ at a
distance of 1.5$^{+1.0}_{-1.0}$ kiloparsec above the disk. The modeling

material at the disk-halo interface on the near side of the M33 disk , with an
accretion rate of $\sim2.9$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The high accretion rate and
the level of metal-enrichment suggest the inflow is likely to be the fall back
of M33 gas from a galactic fountain and/or the gas pulled loosed during a close

reveal the existence of a disk-wide, ionized gas inflow beyond the Milky Way,

attractive alternatives for conventional AFMs as the coupling of magnetism with

electric field control and switching of AFM domains. Here we report the results
of comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations of the quadratic

where the ME coupling coefficient is extremely large (as compared to well-known
multiferroic BiFeO3) and shows sign reversal at
paramagnetic-to-antiferromagnetic phase transition. Moreover, we observe strong
ME response nonlinearity in the AFM phase in the magnetic fields of only few
kOe. To describe the temperature and magnetic field dependencies of the above
unusual features of ME effect in PFN and PFN-xPT, we use simple
phenomenological Landau approach which explains experimental data surprisingly
well. Our ME measurements demonstrate that the electric field of only 20-25
kV/cm is able to switch the AFM domains and align them with ferroelectric ones

are computed along Lagrangian trajectories extracted from direct numerical
simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The particle angular velocity
and its components along the three principal axes of the particle are
considered, expanding on the results presented by \citet{ChevillardMeneveau13}.
The variance of the particle angular velocity, referred to as the particle
enstrophy, is found to increase for particles with elongated shapes. This trend
is explained by considering the contributions of vorticity and strain-rate to
particle rotation. It is found that the majority of particle enstrophy is due
to fluid vorticity. Strain-rate-induced rotations, which are sensitive to
shape, are mostly cancelled by strain-vorticity interactions. The remainder of
the strain-rate-induced rotations are responsible for weak variations in
particle enstrophy. For particles of all shapes, the majority of the enstrophy
is in rotations about the longest axis, which is due to alignment between the
longest axis and fluid vorticity. The integral timescale for particle angular
velocities about each axis reveals that rotations are most persistent about the
longest axis, but that a full revolution is rare.

to +70 d in the rest-frame and a series of 6 spectra from PESSTO covering -7 d
to +50 d. This is among the densest spectroscopic coverage, and
best-constrained rising lightcurve, for a fast-declining hydrogen-poor SLSN.
The bolometric lightcurve can be reproduced with a millisecond magnetar model
with ~ 4 M_sol ejecta mass, and the temperature and velocity evolution is also
suggestive of a magnetar as the power source. Spectral modelling indicates that
the SN ejected ~ 6 M_sol of CO-rich material with a kinetic energy of ~ 7 x
10^51 erg, and suggests a partially thermalised additional source of luminosity
between -2 d and +22 d. This may be due to interaction with a shell of material
originating from pre-explosion mass loss. We further present a detailed
analysis of the host galaxy system of LSQ14mo. PESSTO and GROND imaging show
three spatially resolved bright regions, and we used the VLT and FORS2 to
obtain a deep (five-hour exposure) spectra of the SN position and the three
star-forming regions, which are at a similar redshift. The FORS spectrum at
+300 days shows no trace of SN emission lines and we place limits on the
strength of [O I] from comparisons with other Ic SNe. The deep spectra provides
a unique chance to investigate spatial variations in the host star-formation
activity and metallicity. The specific star-formation rate is similar in all
three components, as is the presence of a young stellar population. However,
the position of LSQ14mo exhibits a lower metallicity, with 12 + log(O/H) = 8.2
in both the R23 and N2 scales (corresponding to ~ 0.3 Z_sol). We propose that
the three bright regions in the host system are interacting, which thus
triggers star-formation and forms young stellar populations.

states. We also provide numerical evidence that at least one of these Bell
inequalities is violated by a pure genuinely entangled state. These Bell

is not to enumerate all existing topics, but to quickly extract representative
ones that broadly cover the content of the corpus, i.e., a few topics that

same number of topics as a user specifies, which have imposed an unnecessary
burden to the users who have limited prior knowledge. We instead propose new
models that are able to learn fewer but more representative topics for the

prominent topics to absorb tokens from similar and smaller topics, thus
enhances the diversity among the top topics extracted. With this reinforced
random walk as a general process embedded in classical topic models, we obtain
\textit{diverse topic models} that are able to extract the most prominent and

specifically, at high redshift (z~5), the mean central density profiles of
H_AGN and H_noAGN dark matter haloes tend to be much steeper than their H_DM
counterparts owing to the rapidly growing baryonic component and ensuing
adiabatic contraction. By z~1.5, these mean halo density profiles in H_AGN have
flattened, pummelled by powerful AGN activity (""quasar mode""): the integrated
inner mass difference gaps with H_noAGN haloes have widened, and those with
H_DM haloes have narrowed. Fast forward 9.5 billion years, down to z=0, and the
trend reverses: H_AGN halo mean density profiles drift back to a more cusped
shape as AGN feedback efficiency dwindles (""radio mode""), and the gaps in
integrated central mass difference with H_noAGN and H_DM close and broaden
respectively. On the galaxy side, the story differs noticeably. Averaged
stellar profile central densities and inner slopes are monotonically reduced by
AGN activity as a function of cosmic time, resulting in better agreement with
local observations. As both dark matter and stellar inner density profiles
respond quite sensitively to the presence of a central AGN, there is hope that
future observational determinations of these quantities can be used constrain

multiple estimators that are consistent under three different observed data

well-known models as its special cases. We look at these special cases and
provide their axiomatic analysis. In cases where an axiomatization has been
previously given in the literature, we connect the existing results with the
framework that we have developed. Next we turn to the question of learning,
which is especially important for the practical applications of the model. So
far, learning of the Choquet integral has been mostly confined to the learning
of the capacity. Such an approach requires making a powerful assumption that
all dimensions (e.g. criteria) are evaluated on the same scale, which is rarely
justified in practice. Too often categorical data is given arbitrary numerical
labels (e.g. AHP), and numerical data is considered cardinally and ordinally
commensurate, sometimes after a simple normalization. Such approaches clearly
lack scientific rigour, and yet they are commonly seen in all kinds of
applications. We discuss the pros and cons of making such an assumption and
look at the consequences which axiomatization uniqueness results have for the
learning problems. Finally, we review some of the applications of the Choquet
integral in decision analysis. Apart from MCDA, which is the main area of
interest for our results, we also discuss how the model can be interpreted in
the social choice context. We look in detail at the state-dependent utility,
and show how comonotonicity, central to the previous axiomatizations, actually
implies state-independency in the Choquet integral model. We also discuss the
conditions required to have a meaningful state-dependent utility representation
and show the novelty of our results compared to the previous methods of
building state-dependent models.

construct a Lagrangian Floer invariant for any closed, oriented $3$-manifold
$Y$ (called the symplectic instanton homology of $Y$ and denoted
$\mathrm{SI}(Y)$) which is conjecturally equivalent to a Floer homology defined
using a certain variant of Yang-Mills gauge theory. The crucial ingredient for
defining $\mathrm{SI}(Y)$ is the use of traceless character varieties in the
symplectic setting, which allow us to avoid the debilitating technical hurdles
present when one attempts to define a symplectic version of instanton Floer
homologies. Furthermore, by studying the effect of Dehn surgeries on traceless

large groups of voters with cohesive preferences should be adequately

proposed two axioms that aim to capture this idea: justified representation
(JR) and its strengthening extended justified representation (EJR). In this
paper, we extend the work of Aziz et al. in several directions. First, we
answer an open question of Aziz et al., by showing that Reweighted Approval
Voting satisfies JR for $k=3, 4, 5$, but fails it for $k\ge 6$. Second, we
observe that EJR is incompatible with the Perfect Representation criterion,
which is important for many applications of multi-winner voting, and propose a
relaxation of EJR, which we call Proportional Justified Representation (PJR).
PJR is more demanding than JR, but, unlike EJR, it is compatible with perfect
representation, and a committee that provides PJR can be computed in polynomial
time if the committee size divides the number of voters. Moreover, just like
EJR, PJR can be used to characterize the classic PAV rule in the class of
weighted PAV rules. On the other hand, we show that EJR provides stronger
guarantees with respect to average voter satisfaction than PJR does.

of time reversal symmetry renders its edge states topologically protected to

be applied to effectively tune the SC and spin Hall current in a QSH system by
control of its bending curvature. Furthermore, the realization of QSH systems

conversion efficiency in NC-based solar cells. To gain insight into the origins
of these improvements, we perform ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) on
experimentally-relevant sized lead sulfide (PbS) NCs constructed with thiol or
Cl, Br, and I anion surfaces. The surface of both the thiol- and
halide-terminated NCs exhibit low and high-energy phonon modes with large
thermal displacements not present in bulk PbS; however, halide anion surface
termination reduces the overlap of the electronic wavefunctions with these
vibration modes. These findings suggest that electron-phonon interactions will
be reduced in the halide terminated NCs, a conclusion that is supported by
analyzing the time-dependent evolution of the electronic energies and
wavefunctions extracted from the AIMD. This work explains why electron-phonon
interactions are crucial to charge carrier dynamics in NCs and how surface
engineering can be applied to systematically control their electronic and
phononic properties. Furthermore, we propose that the computationally efficient
approach of gauging electron-phonon interaction implemented here can be used to

The method couples concurrently the microscopic coefficients in the region of
interest with the homogenized coefficients elsewhere. The cost of the method is
comparable to the heterogeneous multiscale method, while being able to recover
microscopic information of the solution. The convergence of the method is
proved for problems with bounded and measurable coefficients, while the rate of
convergence is established for problems with rapidly oscillating periodic or
almost-periodic coefficients. Numerical results are reported to show the
efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

In this note, we investigate the rate that maximizes the expected

length, two local optima can arise, and it is possible for the globally optimal
rate to converge to a non-zero constant as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$. Moreover,
in the setting where the four pendant branches have equal lengths and either
(i) we replace the two-state model by an infinite-state model or (ii) we retain

flares challenge current models of blazar variability, most of which are unable

this model, Macdonald et al. presented a stacked radio map of PKS 1510$-$089

frequencies in the relativistic jets of some blazars can provide insight into
the underlying nature of the jet plasma. CP can be produced through linear
birefringence, in which initially linearly polarized emission produced in one
region of the jet is altered by Faraday rotation as it propagates through other
regions of the jet with varying magnetic field orientation. Marscher has begun
a study of jets with such magnetic geometries using the Turbulent Extreme
Multi-Zone (TEMZ) model, in which turbulent plasma crossing a standing shock in
the jet is represented by a collection of thousands of individual plasma cells,
each with distinct magnetic field orientations. Here we develop a radiative
transfer scheme that allows the numerical TEMZ code to produce simulated images
of the time-dependent linearly and circularly polarized intensity at different
radio frequencies. In this initial study, we produce synthetic polarized
emission maps that highlight the linear and circular polarization expected
within the model.

set of local landmark detectors are constrained to lie in a subspace, spanned
by a shape point distribution model (PDM). Fitting the model to an object
involves two steps. A response map, which represents the likelihood of the
location of a landmark, is first computed for each landmark using local-texture
detectors. Then, an optimal PDM is determined by jointly maximizing all the
response maps simultaneously, with a global shape constraint. This global
optimization can be considered as a Bayesian inference problem, where the
posterior distribution of the shape parameters, as well as the pose parameters,
can be inferred using maximum a posteriori (MAP). In this paper, we present a
cascaded face-alignment approach, which employs random-forest regressors to
estimate the positions of each landmark, as a likelihood term, efficiently in
the CLM model. Interpretation from CLM framework, this algorithm is named as an
efficient likelihood Bayesian constrained local model (elBCLM). Furthermore, in
each stage of the regressors, the PDM non-rigid parameters of previous stage
can work as shape clues for training each stage regressors. Experimental
results on benchmarks show our approach achieve about 3 to 5 times speed-up
compared with CLM models and improve around 10% on fitting quality compare with

on two unified strategies -- random grouping and attention -- to effectively
reduce the negative impact of noisy web image annotations. Specifically, random
grouping stacks multiple images into a single training instance and thus
increases the labeling accuracy at the instance level. Attention, on the other
hand, suppresses the noisy signals from both incorrectly labeled images and
less discriminative image regions. By conducting intensive experiments on two
challenging datasets, including a newly collected fine-grained dataset with Web

tearing unstable) current sheets in which non-thermal energy distributions are

combined with test particle treatments in MHD snapshots. We explore under which

We quantify energy distributions, acceleration mechanisms, relativistic
corrections to the particle equations of motion and effects of resistivity in

functions posses different levels of complexity. On the other hand, a smoothing

parsimonious representation of the estimated function. The proposed approach
simultaneously achieves parsimony and adaptivity in a computationally efficient

minimax rates for a large class of sparse additive models. The proposed method

radius of the unstable oscillation modes. An one dimensional model of linear
perturbation, which neglects dependence of variables on the coordinate along
the rotational axis of the star, is solved to obtain stable and unstable
eigenmodes. A linear eigenmode having a corotation radius, at which azimuthal
pattern speed of the mode coincides with the stellar angular velocity, is
categorized to either a complex (growing or damping) mode or a purely real mode
belonging to a continuous spectrum of frequency. We compute canonical angular
momentum and its flux to study eigenmodes with corotation radius. In a
dynamically unstable mode, sound wave transports its angular momentum in such a
way that the absolute value of the angular momentum is increased on both sides
of the corotation radius. We further evaluate growth of amplitude of reflected
sound wave incident to a corotation point and find that the over-reflection of
the wave and the trapping of it between the corotation radius and the surface
of the star may qualitatively explain dependences of eigenfrequencies on the
stellar differential rotation. The results suggest that the low $T/W$
instability may be caused by over-reflection of sound waves trapped mainly

(SBC) relations based solely on eclipsing binary stars. We selected a sample of
35 detached eclipsing binaries with trigonometric parallaxes from Gaia DR1 or
Hipparcos, whose absolute dimensions are known with an accuracy better than 3%
and that lie within 0.3 kpc from the Sun. For the purpose of this study, we
used mostly homogeneous optical and near-infrared photometry based on the
Tycho-2 and 2MASS catalogs. We derived geometric angular diameters for all
stars in our sample with a precision better than 10%, and for 11 of them with a
precision better than 2%. The precision of individual angular diameters of the
eclipsing binary components is currently limited by the precision of the
geometric distances ($\sim$5% on average). However, by using a subsample of
systems with the best agreement between their geometric and photometric
distances, we derived the precise SBC relations based only on eclipsing binary
stars. These relations have precisions that are comparable to the best
available SBC relations based on interferometric angular diameters, and they
are fully consistent with them. With very precise Gaia parallaxes becoming
available in the near future, angular diameters with a precision better than 1%
will be abundant. At that point, the main uncertainty in the total error budget
of the SBC relations will come from transformations between different
photometric systems, disentangling of component magnitudes, and for hot OB
stars, the main uncertainty will come from the interstellar extinction
determination. We argue that all these issues can be overcome with modern
high-quality data and conclude that a precision better than 1% is entirely
feasible.

this approach Compositional Modular Networks (CMNs): a novel architecture that

issue on the Internet. These attacks generate a flooding of fake network

efforts to detect and mitigate them, attackers have played a game always
circumventing countermeasures. Today, there is an increase in the number of
infected devices, even more with the advent of the Internet of Things and
flexible communication technologies. Leveraging device-to-device short range
wireless communications and others, infected devices can coordinate
sophisticated botnets, which can be employed to intensify DDoS attacks. The new
generation of botnets is even harder to detect because of their adaptive and
dynamic behavior yielded by infected mobile portable devices. Additionally,
because there can be a large number of geographically distributed devices,
botnets increase DDoS traffic significantly. In face of their new behavior and

widely-used data structures (e.g., bitmap indices in databases) rely on fast
bitwise operations on large bit vectors to achieve high performance.
Unfortunately, in existing systems, regardless of the underlying architecture
(e.g., CPU, GPU, FPGA), the throughput of such bulk bitwise operations is
limited by the available memory bandwidth.
  We propose Buddy, a new mechanism that exploits the analog operation of DRAM
to perform bulk bitwise operations completely inside the DRAM chip. Buddy
consists of two components. First, simultaneous activation of three DRAM rows
that are connected to the same set of sense amplifiers enables us to perform
bitwise AND and OR operations. Second, the inverters present in each sense
amplifier enables us to perform bitwise NOT operations, with modest changes to
the DRAM array. These two components make Buddy functionally complete. Our
implementation of Buddy largely exploits the existing DRAM structure and
interface, and incurs low overhead (1% of DRAM chip area).
  Our evaluations based on SPICE simulations show that, across seven
commonly-used bitwise operations, Buddy provides between 10.9X---25.6X
improvement in raw throughput and 25.1X---59.5X reduction in energy
consumption. We evaluate three real-world data-intensive applications that
exploit bitwise operations: 1) bitmap indices, 2) BitWeaving, and 3)
bitvector-based implementation of sets. Our evaluations show that Buddy
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.

the full 3-body problem can eject a body with as much as 0.31 of the total

effects of the loss of agents and communication links on the controllability of
an information flow graph are previously studied. In this work, the
corresponding results are exploited to introduce some useful indices and

links and agents in the controllability of the overall network. Existing
results are then extended by considering the effects of losses in both links

quantitative measures of reliability for a multi-agent system, and their
important properties are investigated. Lastly, the class of jointly critical
digraphs is introduced and it is stated that if a digraph is jointly critical,
then joint t-controllability is a necessary and sufficient condition for
remaining controllable following the failure of any set of links and agents,
with cardinality less than t. Various examples are exploited throughout the

(ETSs) for irregular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. These sets are
known to be the main culprits in the error floor region of such codes. The
characterization of ETSs for irregular codes has been known to be a challenging
problem due to the large variety of non-isomorphic ETS structures that can
exist within the Tanner graph of these codes. This is a direct consequence of
the variety of the degrees of the variable nodes that can participate in such
structures. The proposed characterization is based on a hierarchical graphical
representation of ETSs, starting from simple cycles of the graph, or from
single variable nodes, and involves three simple expansion techniques:
degree-one tree ($dot$), $path$ and $lollipop$, thus, the terminology {\em dpl
characterization}. A similar dpl characterization was proposed in an earlier
work by the authors for the leafless ETSs (LETSs) of variable-regular LDPC
codes. The present paper generalizes the prior work to codes with a variety of
variable node degrees and to ETSs that are not leafless. The proposed dpl
characterization corresponds to an efficient search algorithm that, for a given
irregular LDPC code, can find all the instances of $(a,b)$ ETSs with size $a$
and with the number of unsatisfied check nodes $b$ within any range of interest
$a \leq a_{max}$ and $b \leq b_{max}$, exhaustively. Although, (brute force)
exhaustive search algorithms for ETSs of irregular LDPC codes exist, to the
best of our knowledge, the proposed search algorithm is the first of its kind,
in that, it is devised based on a characterization of ETSs that makes the
search process efficient. Extensive simulation results are presented to show
the versatility of the search algorithm, and to demonstrate that, compared to
the literature, significant improvement in search speed can be obtained.

method. Binary hashing is widely used for large-scale image retrieval as well
as video and document searches because the compact representation of binary
code is essential for data storage and reasonable for query searches using
bit-operations. The recently proposed Supervised Discrete Hashing (SDH)
efficiently solves mixed-integer programming problems by alternating
optimization and the Discrete Cyclic Coordinate descent (DCC) method. We show
that the SDH model can be simplified without performance degradation based on
some preliminary experiments; we call the approximate model for this the ""Fast
SDH"" (FSDH) model. We analyze the FSDH model and provide a mathematically exact
solution for it. In contrast to SDH, our model does not require an alternating
optimization algorithm and does not depend on initial values. FSDH is also
easier to implement than Iterative Quantization (ITQ). Experimental results
involving a large-scale database showed that FSDH outperforms conventional SDH
in terms of precision, recall, and computation time.

solar atmosphere into the corona. Some material falls back to the solar
surface, and hits the light bridge (i.e., the base of the light wall), then
sudden brightenings appear at the wall base followed by the rise of wall top,
leading to an increase of the wall height. Once the brightness of the wall base
fades, the height of the light wall begins to decrease. Five hours later,
another nearby flare takes place, a bright channel is formed that extends from
the flare towards the light bridge. Although no obvious material flow along the
bright channel is found, some ejected material is conjectured to reach the
light bridge. Subsequently, the wall base brightens and the wall height begins
to increase again. Once more, when the brightness of the wall base decays, the
wall top fluctuates to lower heights. We suggest, based on the observed cases,
that the interaction of falling material and ejected flare material with the
light wall results in the brightenings of wall base and causes the height of
the light wall to increase. Our results reveal that the light wall can be not
only powered by the linkage of \emph{p}-mode from below the photosphere, but

but unfortunately this showed either poor stability (M = Sn) or weakly
absorbing oversized indirect gaps (M = Bi), prompting concerns that perhaps

we exploit the electronic structure underpinning of classic Cu[In,Ga]Se$_{2}$
(CIGS) chalcopyrite solar absorbers to design Pb-free halide perovskites by
transmuting 2Pb to the pair [B$^{IB}$ + C$^{III}$]. The resulting group of
double perovskites with formula A$_2$BCX$_6$ (A = K, Rb, Cs; B = Cu, Ag; C =
Ga, In; X = Cl, Br, I) benefits from the ionic, yet narrow-gap character of
halide perovskites, and at the same time borrows the advantage of the strong
and rapidly rising Cu(d)/Se(p) $\rightarrow$ Ga/In(s/p)
valence-to-conduction-band absorption spectra known from CIGS. This constitutes
a new group of CuIn-based Halide Perovskite (CIHP). Our first-principles
calculations guided by such design principles indicate that the CIHPs class has
members with clear thermodynamic stability, showing rather strong direct-gap
optical transitions, and manifesting a wide-range of tunable gap values (from
zero to about 2.5 eV) and combination of light electron and heavy-light hole

  We prove that each of these processes boasts stronger level repulsion than
the sine process describing the limiting statistics of the eigenvalues: the
probability to find $k$ critical points in a short interval is comparable to
the probability to find $k+1$ eigenvalues there. We also prove a similar

conditionally on the Riemann hypothesis but not on the multiple correlation

the inventor. An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem.
So patents often have a high concentration of scientific and technical terms
that are rare in everyday language. The Chinese word segmentation model trained
on currently available everyday language data sets performs poorly because it
cannot effectively recognize these scientific and technical terms. In this
paper we describe a pragmatic approach to Chinese word segmentation on patents
where we train a character-based semi-supervised sequence labeling model by
extracting features from a manually segmented corpus of 142 patents, enhanced
with information extracted from the Chinese TreeBank. Experiments show that the
accuracy of our model reached 95.08% (F1 score) on a held-out test set and
96.59% on development set, compared with an F1 score of 91.48% on development
set if the model is trained on the Chinese TreeBank. We also experimented with
some existing domain adaptation techniques, the results show that the amount of
target domain data and the selected features impact the performance of the
domain adaptation techniques.

radical pair (RP) compass, and what determines the singlet yield have not been
fully understood. In this paper, we find that the dark states of the
two-electron Zeeman energy operator (TEZE) play an important role in the RP
compass. We respectively calculate the singlet yields for two initial states in
this dark state basis: the coherent state and the same state just removing the
dark state coherence. For the later there is neither dark state coherence nor
entanglement in the whole dynamical process. Surprisingly we find that in both
cases the singlet yields are the same, and based on this result, we believe
that the dark state population determines the singlet yield completely, and the
dark state coherence and entanglement have little contribution to it. Finally,
we also find that the dark state population as well as the singlet yield
anisotropy is fragile to the vertical magnetic noise. However, the orientation
is robust and is even enhanced by the parallel magnetic noise because the dark
states expand a decoherence-free subspace. The dark state population as well as
the orientation is more robust to the hyperfine coupling noise.

electric properties shape the frequency scaling of brain signals at different
scales, such as intracellular recordings, the local field potential (LFP), the
electroencephalogram (EEG) or the magnetoencephalogram (MEG). These signals
display frequency-scaling properties which are not consistent with resistive
media. The medium appears to exert a frequency filtering scaling as
$1/\sqrt{f}$, which is the typical frequency scaling of ionic diffusion. Such a
scaling was also found recently by impedance measurements in physiological
conditions. Ionic diffusion appears to be the only possible explanation to
reconcile these measurements and the frequency-scaling properties found in
different brain signals. However, other measurements suggest that the
extracellular medium is essentially resistive. To resolve this discrepancy, we
show new evidence that metal-electrode measurements can be perturbed by shunt
currents going through the surface of the brain. Such a shunt may explain the
contradictory measurements, and together with ionic diffusion, provides a
framework where all observations can be reconciled. Finally, we propose a
method to perform measurements avoiding shunting effects, thus enabling to test
the predictions of this framework.

large datasets that is quite popular in big data analytics. It has various
configuration parameters (knobs) which play an important role in deciding the
performance i.e., the execution time of a given big data processing job.
Default values of these parameters do not always result in good performance and
hence it is important to tune them. However, there is inherent difficulty in
tuning the parameters due to two important reasons - firstly, the parameter
search space is large and secondly, there are cross-parameter interactions.
Hence, there is a need for a dimensionality-free method which can automatically
tune the configuration parameters by taking into account the cross-parameter
dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel Hadoop parameter tuning
methodology, based on a noisy gradient algorithm known as the simultaneous
perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). The SPSA algorithm tunes the
parameters by directly observing the performance of the Hadoop MapReduce
system. The approach followed is independent of parameter dimensions and
requires only $2$ observations per iteration while tuning. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methodology in achieving good performance on popular

\emph{Word Co-occurrence} and \emph{Terasort}. Our method, when tested on a 25

eV cosmic rays are believed to be produced in the Milky Way while above that
energy their origin is probably extragalactic. In the early '30s supernovae
were already identified as possible sources for the Galactic component of
cosmic rays. After the '70s this idea has gained more and more credibility
thanks to the the development of the diffusive shock acceleration theory, which
provides a robust theoretical framework for particle energization in
astrophysical environments. Afterwards, mostly in recent years, much
observational evidence has been gathered in support of this framework,
converting a speculative idea in a real paradigm. In this Chapter the basic
pillars of this paradigm will be illustrated. This includes the acceleration
mechanism, the non linear effects produced by accelerated particles onto the

the sources and the transportation of cosmic rays through the Galaxy. The
theoretical picture will be corroborated by discussing several observations

substrates for their ease of preparation and hydrophobic properties. We have
observed that these atomically smooth monolayers also provide a slip boundary
condition for dewetting films composed of unentangled polymers. This slip
length, an indirect measure of the friction between a given liquid and
different solids, is switchable and can be increased [Fetzer et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 2005; B\""aumchen et al. J. Phys.: Cond. Matt. 2012] if the alkyl chain
length is changed from 18 to 12 backbone carbons, for example. Typically, this
change in boundary condition is affected in a quantized way, using one or the
other alkyl chain length, thus obtaining one or the other slip length. Here, we
present results in which this SAM structure is changed in a continuous way. We
prepare SAMs containing bidisperse mixed SAMs of alkyl silanes, with the
composition as a control parameter. We find that all the mixed SAMs we
investigated show an enhanced slip boundary condition as compared to the
single-component SAMs. The slip boundary condition is accessed using optical
and atomic force microscopy, and we describe these observations in the context
of X-ray reflectivity measurements. The slip length, varying over nearly two
orders of magnitude, of identical polymer melts on chemically similar SAMs is
found to correlate with the density of exposed alkyl chains. Our results
demonstrate the importance of a well characterized solid/liquid pair, down to
the angstrom level, when discussing friction between a liquid and a solid.

stateless computation encompasses both classical game-theoretic notions of

embark on a holistic exploration of stateless computation. We tackle two
important questions: (1) Under what conditions is self-stabilization, i.e.,
guaranteed ""convergence"" to a ""legitimate"" global configuration, achievable for
stateless computation? and (2) What is the computational power of stateless

the power spectrum of primordial perturbations generated during inflation. So
far no PBHs have been observed, and instead, increasingly stringent bounds on
their existence at different scales have been obtained. Up until recently, this
has been exploited in attempts to constrain parts of the inflationary power
spectrum that are unconstrained by cosmological observations. We first point
out that the simple translation of the PBH non-observation bounds into
constraints on the primordial power spectrum is inaccurate as it fails to
include realistic aspects of PBH formation and evolution. We then demonstrate,
by studying two examples of uncertainties from the effects of critical and
non-spherical collapse, that even though they may seem small, they have
important implications for the usefulness of the constraints. In particular, we
point out that the uncertainty induced by non-spherical collapse may be much
larger than the difference between particular bounds from PBH non-observations
and the general maximum cap stemming from the condition $\Omega \leq 1$ on the
dark-matter density in the form of PBHs. We therefore make the cautious
suggestion of applying only the overall maximum dark-matter constraint to
models of early Universe, as this requirement seems to currently provide a more
reliable constraint, which better reflects our current lack of detailed
knowledge of PBH formation. These, and other effects, such as merging,
clustering and accretion, may also loosen constraints from non-observations of
other primordial compact objects such as ultra-compact minihalos of dark
matter.

to provide a characterization of non-perturbative aspects of the theory in a
BRST invariant and gauge parameter independent way. In particular, it turns out
that the poles of <A^h A^h> are the same as those of the transverse part of the

parameter entering the gauge condition through the Nielsen identities. The
latter follow from the new exact BRST invariant formulation introduced before.
Moreover, the correlator <A^h A^h> enables us to attach a BRST invariant
meaning to the possible positivity violation of the corresponding temporal
Schwinger correlator, giving thus for the first time a consistent, gauge
parameter independent, setup to adopt the positivity violation of <A^h A^h> as
a signature for gluon confinement. Finally, in the context of gauge theories

  2016), Delft, The Netherlands, 5-7 Oct 2016",,,,"cs.FL q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context-free and context-sensitive formal grammars are often regarded as more
appropriate to model proteins than regular level models such as finite state
automata and Hidden Markov Models. In theory, the claim is well founded in the
fact that many biologically relevant interactions between residues of protein
sequences have a character of nested or crossed dependencies. In practice,
there is hardly any evidence that grammars of higher expressiveness have an
edge over old good HMMs in typical applications including recognition and
classification of protein sequences. This is in contrast to RNA modeling, where
CFG power some of the most successful tools. There have been proposed several
explanations of this phenomenon. On the biology side, one difficulty is that
interactions in proteins are often less specific and more ""collective"" in
comparison to RNA. On the modeling side, a difficulty is the larger alphabet
which combined with high complexity of CF and CS grammars imposes considerable
trade-offs consisting on information reduction or learning sub-optimal
solutions. Indeed, some studies hinted that CF level of expressiveness brought
an added value in protein modeling when CF and regular grammars where
implemented in the same framework. However, there have been no systematic study
of explanatory power provided by various grammatical models. The first step to
this goal is define objective criteria of such evaluation. Intuitively, a
decent explanatory grammar should generate topology, or the parse tree,
consistent with topology of the protein, or its secondary and/or tertiary
structure. In this piece of research we build on this intuition and propose a
set of measures to compare topology of the parse tree of a grammar with
topology of the protein structure.

general observation that increasing depth increases the performance of a
network. Recently, however, evidence has been amassing that simply increasing
depth may not be the best way to increase performance, particularly given other
limitations. Investigations into deep residual networks have also suggested
that they may not in fact be operating as a single deep network, but rather as
an ensemble of many relatively shallow networks. We examine these issues, and
in doing so arrive at a new interpretation of the unravelled view of deep
residual networks which explains some of the behaviours that have been observed
experimentally. As a result, we are able to derive a new, shallower,
architecture of residual networks which significantly outperforms much deeper
models such as ResNet-200 on the ImageNet classification dataset. We also show
that this performance is transferable to other problem domains by developing a
semantic segmentation approach which outperforms the state-of-the-art by a
remarkable margin on datasets including PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, and
Cityscapes. The architecture that we propose thus outperforms its comparators,
including very deep ResNets, and yet is more efficient in memory use and
sometimes also in training time. The code and models are available at

is that nutrient concentration on the boundary is less than external supply due
to a Gibbs-Thomson relation and the problem has two radial stationary
solutions, which differs from widely studied tumor spheroid model with surface
tension effect. We first establish local well-posedness by using a functional
approach based on Fourier multiplier method and analytic semigroup theory. Then
we investigate stability of each radial stationary solution. By employing a
generalized principle of linearized stability, we prove that the radial
stationary solution with a smaller radius is always unstable, and there exists
a positive threshold value $\gamma_*$ of cell-to-cell adhesiveness $\gamma$,
such that the radial stationary solution with a larger radius is asymptotically
stable for $\gamma>\gamma_*$, and unstable for $0<\gamma<\gamma_*$.

similar to the well-known main sequence (MS) measured for globally integrated
star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses. The SGMS slope depends on
galaxy morphology, with late-type galaxies (Sc$-$Irr) having $\alpha = 0.97$
and early-type spirals (Sa$-$Sbc) having $\alpha = 0.81$. The SGMS constructed
from sub-regions of individual galaxies has on average the same characteristics
as the composite SGMS from all galaxies. The SGMS for galaxy nuclei shows a
dispersion similar to that seen for other sub-regions. Sampling a limited range
of SFR$-$M$_{\star} $ space may produce either sub-linearity or super-linearity
of the SGMS slope. For nearly all galaxies, both SFR and stellar mass peak in
the nucleus, indicating that circumnuclear clusters are among the most actively
star-forming regions in the galaxy and the most massive. The nuclear SFR also
correlates with total galaxy mass, forming a distinct sequence from the
standard MS of star-formation. The nuclear main sequence will be useful for
studying bulge growth and for characterizing feedback processes connecting AGN

formation and evolution, and their abundances should also have a significant
impact on planetary formation and evolution.
  Aims. We present a detailed spectroscopic analysis of 1110 solar-type stars,
143 of which are known to have planetary companions. We have determined the
carbon abundances of these stars and investigate a possible connection between
C and the presence of planetary companions. Methods. We used the HARPS
spectrograph to obtain high-resolution optical spectra of our targets. Spectral
synthesis of the CH band at 4300\AA was performed with the spectral synthesis
codes MOOG and FITTING.
  Results. We have studied carbon in several reliable spectral windows and have
obtained abundances and distributions that show that planet host stars are
carbon rich when compared to single stars, a signature caused by the known
metal-rich nature of stars with planets. We find no different behaviour when
separating the stars by the mass of the planetary companion.
  Conclusions. We conclude that reliable carbon abundances can be derived for
solar-type stars from the CH band at 4300\AA. We confirm two different slope
trends for [C/Fe] with [Fe/H] because the behaviour is opposite for stars above
and below solar values. We observe a flat distribution of the [C/Fe] ratio for
all planetary masses, a finding that apparently excludes any clear connection
between the [C/Fe] abundance ratio and planetary mass.

relationships among firms. Although there is not a general consensus among
researchers yet, many studies point that scale-free topologies, where few
highly related firms are combined with many low-related firms, assure the
highest efficiency of a supply chain. This paper studies the network topology
that leads to the highest agility of the supply chain when sudden demand
changes occur. To do this, an agent-based model of a supply chain with
restricted relationship between agents is built. The model includes three
tiers, where the flow of material is distributed from the bottom supplier to
the final customer passing necessarily through firms in every tier. Agility is
measured in the model simulations through the order fulfillment rate. Unlike to
previous theoretical and lab results, the simulation of the model shows that
the highest levels of agility are not obtained with a scale-free topology.
Instead, homogeneous distribution of links, such as those induced by regular or
Poisson probability laws, shows higher agility values than heterogeneous
distributions. Other previous recommendations, such as redundancy or having
multiple suppliers, are confirmed by the simulations. The general conclusion is
that the most suitable network topology in terms of agility depends on the
specific conditions of the supply chain and the aspects of the performance to
be analyzed.

user dependent features. It exploits the typicality of each and every user to
select different features for different users. Initially all possible features
are extracted for all users and a method of feature selection is employed for
selecting user dependent features. The selected features are clustered using
Fuzzy C means algorithm. In order to preserve the intra-class variation within
each user, we recommend to represent each cluster in the form of an interval
valued symbolic feature vector. A method of signature verification based on the
proposed cluster based symbolic representation is also presented. Extensive
experimentations are conducted on MCYT-100 User (DB1) and MCYT-330 User (DB2)

resorting to the canonical Caldeira-Leggett Hamiltonian and find analytically
the exact stationary state of the probe for arbitrary coupling strength. In
general, the probe does not reach thermal equilibrium with the sample, due to
their non-perturbative interaction. We argue that this is advantageous for low

probe-sampling coupling, (ii) the variance of a suitable quadrature of our
Brownian thermometer can yield temperature estimates with nearly minimal

valence compound SmB$_6$. Sm mean valence, $v_{\rm Sm}$, was measured by X-ray
absorption spectroscopy as functions of pressure ($1<P<13$ GPa) and temperature
($3<T<300$ K). Pressure induced magnetic order (MO) was detected above $P_c =
10$ GPa by resistivity measurements. A shift toward localized $4f$ state with
increasing $P$ and/or $T$ is evident from an increase in $v_{\rm Sm}$. However
$v_{\rm Sm}$ at $P_c$ is anomalously far below 3, which differs from the
general case of nonmagnetic-magnetic transition in Yb and Ce compounds. From
the $T$ dependence of $v_{\rm Sm}(P,T)$, we found that $v_{\rm Sm}(P,T)$
consists of two different characteristic components: one is associated with
low-energy electronic correlations involving Kondo like behavior, and the other
with high-energy valence fluctuations.

arrays and massive audience is investigated in this paper. Multicast
beamforming design is a well-known non-convex quadratically constrained
quadratic programming (QCQP) problem. A conventional method to tackle this
problem is to approximate it as a semi-definite programming problem via
semi-definite relaxation, whose performance, however, deteriorates considerably
as the number of per-group users goes large. A recent attempt is to apply
convex-concave procedure (CCP) to find a stationary solution by treating it as
a difference of convex programming problem, whose complexity, however,
increases dramatically as the problem size increases. In this paper, we propose
a low-complexity high-performance algorithm for multi-group multicast
beamforming design in large-scale wireless systems by leveraging the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) together with CCP. In
specific, the original non-convex QCQP problem is first approximated as a
sequence of convex subproblems via CCP. Each convex subproblem is then
reformulated as a novel ADMM form. Our ADMM reformulation enables that each
updating step is performed by solving multiple small-size subproblems with
closed-form solutions in parallel. Numerical results show that our fast

executed on the matrix polynomial to simultaneously bring the leading matrix
coefficient and the constant matrix term to triangular form before forming the
companion pencil. The resulting structure allows us to stably factor each
matrix of the pencil as a product of $k$ matrices of unitary-plus-rank-one

the formula.We present a pre-processing heuristic that identifies certain types
of decomposed multipliers, and adds special assertions to the input formula
encoding the equivalence of sub-terms to word-level multiplication. The
pre-processed formulas are then solved using an SMT solver. Our experiments

solved quickly, while the same formulas time out without the pre-processing
step.

4-dimensional and all these symmetries are also symmetries of the

a non-removable parameter. In the second part of the paper we extend these

concentrated in a nested hierarchy of clusters within clusters. We present a
new algorithm for statistically analysing the distribution of stars to quantify
the level of sub-structure. We suggest that, even at the simplest level, the
internal structure of a fractal cluster requires the specification of three
parameters. (i) The 3D fractal dimension, $\mathcal{D}$, measures the extent to
which the clusters on one level of the nested hierarchy fill the volume of
their parent cluster. (ii) The number of levels, $\mathcal{L}$, reflects the
finite ratio between the linear size of the large root-cluster at the top of
the hierarchy, and the smallest leaf-clusters at the bottom of the hierarchy.
(iii) The volume-density scaling exponent, $\mathcal{C}=-\textrm{d}\ln[\delta
n]/\textrm{d}\ln[L]$ measures the factor by which the excess density, $\delta
n$, in a structure of scale $L$, exceeds that of the background formed by
larger structures; it is similar, but not exactly equivalent, to the exponent
in Larson's scaling relation between density and size for molecular clouds. We
describe an algorithm which can be used to constrain the values of $({\cal
D},{\cal L},{\cal C})$ and apply this method to artificial and observed
clusters. We show that this algorithm is able to reliably describe the three
dimensional structure of an artificial star cluster from the two dimensional
projection, and quantify the varied structures observed in real and simulated
clusters.

computer vision applications. This paper proposes an effective and robust
approach for facial landmark detection by combining data- and model-driven
methods. Firstly, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) is trained to compute
response maps of all facial landmark points. Such a data-driven method could
make full use of holistic information in a facial image for global estimation
of facial landmarks. After that, the maximum points in the response maps are
fitted with a pre-trained Point Distribution Model (PDM) to generate the
initial facial shape. This model-driven method is able to correct the
inaccurate locations of outliers by considering the shape prior information.
Finally, a weighted version of Regularized Landmark Mean-Shift (RLMS) is
employed to fine-tune the facial shape iteratively. This
Estimation-Correction-Tuning process perfectly combines the advantages of the
global robustness of data-driven method (FCN), outlier correction capability of
model-driven method (PDM) and non-parametric optimization of RLMS. Results of
extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performances on challenging datasets including 300W, AFLW, AFW and COFW. The
proposed method is able to produce satisfying detection results on face images
with exaggerated expressions, large head poses, and partial occlusions.

  To this end, open source, arduino-like modules have been developed to build a

momentum. We discuss the implications of these demotions for few-body

to systematize the procedure in a way that is compatible with the effective

Activity-based quality models break down this complex concept into concrete
definitions, more precisely facts about the system, process, and environment as
well as their impact on activities performed on and with the system. However,
these models lack an operationalisation that would allow them to be used in
assessment and prediction of quality. Bayesian networks have been shown to be a
viable means for this task incorporating variables with uncertainty. Objective:
The qualitative knowledge contained in activity-based quality models are an
abundant basis for building Bayesian networks for quality assessment. This
paper describes a four-step approach for deriving systematically a Bayesian
network from an assessment goal and a quality model. Method: The four steps of
the approach are explained in detail and with running examples. Furthermore, an
initial evaluation is performed, in which data from NASA projects and an open
source system is obtained. The approach is applied to this data and its
applicability is analysed. Results: The approach is applicable to the data from
the NASA projects and the open source system. However, the predictive results
vary depending on the availability and quality of the data, especially the
underlying general distributions. Conclusion: The approach is viable in a
realistic context but needs further investigation in case studies in order to
analyse its predictive validity.

These particles can be used to study the physics of collective motion in active

self-diffusiophoresis, the classical physical model relies on a steady solution
of the diffusion equation, from which chemical gradients, phoretic flows and
ultimately the swimming velocity, may be derived. Motivated by disk-shaped
particles in thin films and under confinement, we examine the extension to two
dimensions. Because the two-dimensional diffusion equation lacks a steady state
with the correct boundary conditions, Laplace transforms must be used to study
the long-time behavior of the problem and determine the swimming velocity. For
fixed chemical fluxes on the particle surface, we find that the swimming
velocity ultimately always decays logarithmically in time. In the case of
finite Peclet numbers, we solve the full advection-diffusion equation
numerically and show that this decay can be avoided by the particle moving to
regions of unconsumed reactant. Finite advection thus regularizes the

tube atmospheres. Yet, limb darkening measurements show no dependence upon
activity level, even at an rms precision of 0.04%. We study the sensitivity of
limb darkening to changes in area filling factor using a 3D MHD model of the
magnetized photosphere. The limb darkening change expected from the measured 11
yr area variation lies below the level of measured limb darkening variations,
for a reasonable range of magnetic flux in quiet network and internetwork
regions. So the remarkably constant limb darkening observed over the solar
activity cycle is not inconsistent with the measured 11 year change in area of
quiet magnetic network. Our findings offer an independent constraint on
photospheric temperature gradient changes reported from measurements of the

some random delays. Then this accumulated reward can be regarded as
multivariate discounted Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) claims in actuarial
science and some important quantities studied in queueing theory such as the
number of customers in G/G/infinity queues with correlated batch arrivals. We
study the long term behavior of this process as well as its moments. Asymptotic
expressions and bounds for the quantities of our interest, and also convergence
result for the distribution of this process after renormalization, are studied,
when interarrival times and time delays are light tailed. Next, assuming
exponentially distributed delays, we derive some explicit and numerically
feasible expressions for the limiting joint moments. In such case, for an
innite server queues with renewal arrival process, we obtain limiting results
on the expectation of the workload, and the covariance of queue size and
workload. Finally, some queueing theoretic applications are providedMSC

spectroscopy of the type Ic superluminous supernova (SLSN) Gaia16apd (= SN
2016eay), covering its evolution from 26 d before the $g$-band peak to 234.1 d
after the peak. Gaia16apd was followed as a part of the NOT Unbiased Transient
Survey (NUTS). It is one of the closest SLSNe known ($z = 0.102\pm0.001$), with
detailed optical and ultraviolet (UV) observations covering the peak. Gaia16apd
is a spectroscopically typical type Ic SLSN, exhibiting the characteristic blue
early spectra with O II absorption, and reaches a peak $M_{g} = -21.8 \pm 0.1$
mag. However, photometrically it exhibits an evolution intermediate between the
fast- and slowly-declining type Ic SLSNe, with an early evolution closer to the
fast-declining events. Together with LSQ12dlf, another SLSN with similar
properties, it demonstrates a possible continuum between fast- and
slowly-declining events. It is unusually UV-bright even for a SLSN, reaching a
non-$K$-corrected $M_{uvm2} \simeq -23.3$ mag, the only other type Ic SLSN with
similar UV brightness being SN 2010gx. Assuming that Gaia16apd was powered by
magnetar spin-down, we derive a period of $P = 1.9\pm0.2$ ms and a magnetic
field of $B = 1.9\pm0.2 \times 10^{14}$ G for the magnetar. The estimated
ejecta mass is between 8 and 16 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and the kinetic energy
between 1.3 and $2.5 \times 10^{52}$ erg, depending on opacity and assuming
that the entire ejecta is swept up into a thin shell. Despite the early
photometric differences, the spectra at late times are similar to
slowly-declining type Ic SLSNe, implying that the two subclasses originate from
similar progenitors.

treasure and an exit are located at unknown positions on the perimeter of a
disk and at known arc distance. A team of two robots start from the center of
the disk, and their goal is to fetch the treasure to the exit. At any time the
robots can move anywhere they choose on the disk, independently of each other,
with the same speed. A robot detects an interesting point (treasure or exit)
only if it passes over the exact location of that point. We are interested in
designing distributed algorithms that minimize the worst-case
treasure-evacuation time, i.e. the time it takes for the treasure to be
discovered and brought (fetched) to the exit by any of the robots.
  The communication protocol between the robots is either wireless, where
information is shared at any time, or face-to-face (i.e. non-wireless), where
information can be shared only if the robots meet. For both models we obtain
upper bounds for fetching the treasure to the exit. Our main technical
contribution pertains to the face-to-face model. More specifically, we
demonstrate how robots can exchange information without meeting, effectively
achieving a highly efficient treasure-evacuation protocol which is minimally
affected by the lack of distant communication. Finally, we complement our
positive results above by providing a lower bound in the face-to-face model.

has been shown that uniformly distributed location-unaware sensors cannot infer

  This work studies asymmetric (nonuniform) distributions on location-unaware
sensors that will enable bandlimited field inference. For the sake of
analytical tractability, location-unaware sensors are restricted to a discrete
grid. Oversampling followed by clustering of the samples using the probability
distribution that governs sensor placement on the grid is used to infer the
field . Based on this clustering algorithm, the main result of this work is to
find the optimal probability distribution on sensor locations that minimizes
the detection error-probability of the underlying spatial field. The proposed
clustering algorithm is also extended to include the case of signal
reconstruction in the presence of sensor noise by treating the distribution of
the noisy samples as a mixture model and using clustering to estimate the
mixture model parameters.

role in quantum gravity. In this paper we study the breaking of asymptotic
symmetries associated with a null horizon boundary. In two-dimensions, these
symmetries are reparametrizations of the time parameter on the horizon. We show
how this horizon reparametrization symmetry is explicitly and spontaneously
broken in dilaton gravity and construct an effective action for these
pseudo-Goldstone modes using the on-shell gravitational action for a null
boundary. The variation of this action yields the horizon constraint equation.
This action is invariant under a 2 parameter subgroup of $SL(2)$
transformations, whose Noether charges we interpret via the membrane paradigm.
We place these results in the context of recent work on the near $AdS_2$/ near
$CFT_1$ correspondence. In this setting the horizon action characterizes the
infrared regime near the horizon and has a hydrodynamical sigma model form. We
also discuss our construction in General Relativity. In the three-dimensional
case there is a natural generalization of our results. However, in higher
dimensions, the variation of the effective action only yields the Raychaudhuri
equation for small perturbations of the horizon.

fluences (e.g. 2.0x10E16 1 MeV equivalent neutrons/cm2). We present the

  Decision Making",,,,,"cs.LG cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A large body of work in behavioral fields attempts to develop models that
describe the way people, as opposed to rational agents, make decisions. A
recent Choice Prediction Competition (2015) challenged researchers to suggest a
model that captures 14 classic choice biases and can predict human decisions
under risk and ambiguity. The competition focused on simple decision problems,
in which human subjects were asked to repeatedly choose between two gamble
options.
  In this paper we present our approach for predicting human decision behavior:
we suggest to use machine learning algorithms with features that are based on
well-established behavioral theories. The basic idea is that these
psychological features are essential for the representation of the data and are
important for the success of the learning process. We implement a vanilla model
in which we train SVM models using behavioral features that rely on the
psychological properties underlying the competition baseline model. We show
that this basic model captures the 14 choice biases and outperforms all the
other learning-based models in the competition. The preliminary results suggest
that such hybrid models can significantly improve the prediction of human
decision making, and are a promising direction for future research.

However, as real objects are non-unitary (absorptive), part of the transmitted
state contains only a single photon, which is overlooked in traditional
coincidence measurements. The single photon part has a drastically different
spatial distribution than the two-photon part. It contains information both
about the object, and, remarkably, the spatial entanglement properties of the

model behind it and it can explain some of the basic characteristics of quantum
mechanics. It will be shown that if look at the properties of a charged
particle in a random electric field one can obtain the discrete energy values
of the harmonic oscillator and the infinite potential well, and also gives a
good qualitative description of the double-slit experiment and measurement
theory. Also the side-effect of the model is the emergence of a constant with

  convergence for fractional nonlinear differential equations","11 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech nlin.PS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fractional nonlinear differential equations present an interplay between two
common and important effective descriptions used to simplify high dimensional
or more complicated theories: nonlinearity and fractional derivatives. These
effective descriptions thus appear commonly in physical and mathematical
modeling. We present a new series method providing systematic controlled
accuracy for solutions of fractional nonlinear differential equations. The
method relies on spatially iterative use of power series expansions. Our
approach permits an arbitrarily large radius of convergence and thus solves the
typical divergence problem endemic to power series approaches. We apply our
method to the fractional nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation and its imaginary
time rotation, the fractional nonlinear diffusion equation. For the fractional
nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation we find fractional generalizations of cnoidal
waves of Jacobi elliptic functions as well as a fractional bright soliton. For
the fractional nonlinear diffusion equation we find the combination of
fractional and nonlinear effects results in a more strongly localized solution
which nevertheless still exhibits power law tails, albeit at a much lower
density.

space is performed, in which the space coordinates $(x, y)$ are
non-commutative, satisfying the commutation relation $[x, y]=i \theta$. The
Navier-Stokes equation has an extra force term which reflects the
non-commutativity of the space, being proportional to $\theta^2$. This
parameter $\theta$ is related to the minimum size of fluid particles which is
implied by the uncertainty principle, $\Delta x \Delta y \ge \theta/2$. To see
the effect of this parameter on the flow, following situation is considered. An
obstacle placed in the middle of the stream, separates the flow into small slit
and large slit, but the flow is joined afterwards in the down stream. For the
Reynolds number 700, the behavior of the flows with and without $\theta$ is
observed to differ, and the difference is seen to be correlated to the
difference of the activity of vortices in the down stream. The oscillation of
the flow rate at the small slit diminishes after the certain time in the usual
flow when the ""two attached eddies"" appear. In the non-commutative flow this
two attached eddies appear from the beginning and the behavior of the flows
does not fluctuate largely. The irregularity in the flow existing in the
beginning disappears after the certain time.

  tests","5 pages",,,,"math.HO math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Testing convergence of infinite series is an important part of mathematics. A
very basic test of convergence is to upper-bound a given series with a known
series, term by term. In $19^{th}$ century, Kummer proposed a test of
convergence for any positive series based on finding a suitable positive
sequence $\{p_n\}$ and a suitable real constant $c$. It can be easily shown
that by choosing appropriate sequence $\{p_n\}$, the Kummer's test yields other
tests like Raabe's, Gauss' or Bertrand's as its special cases. In 1995,
Samelson noted that there is another interesting relation between Kummer's test
and basic comparison tests, particularly, that one can transform the sequence
$\{p_n\}$ into a convergent bounding series, and he sketched a simple proof of
this statement. In this paper, we fill the missing formal proof, although using
a different approach, and we show how to construct a bounding series from the
sequence $\{p_n\}$ and vice versa.

the Noether procedure, we have obtained a specific dual (gauge invariant)
