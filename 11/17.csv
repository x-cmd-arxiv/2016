electroweak corrections to ZZ production, including the leptonic decays of the
Z bosons into $\mu^+\mu^-\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^-$ or $\mu^+\mu^-\mu^+\mu^-$
final states. We use complete leading-order and next-to-leading-order matrix
elements for four-lepton production, including contributions of virtual photons
and all off-shell effects of Z bosons, where the finite Z-boson width is taken
into account using the complex-mass scheme. The matrix elements are implemented
into Monte Carlo programs allowing for the evaluation of arbitrary differential
distributions. We present integrated and differential cross sections for the
LHC at 13 TeV both for an inclusive setup where only lepton identification cuts
are applied, and for a setup motivated by Higgs-boson analyses in the
four-lepton decay channel. The electroweak corrections are divided into
photonic and purely weak contributions. The former show the well-known
pronounced tails near kinematical thresholds and resonances; the latter are
generically at the level of $\sim-5\%$ and reach several $-10\%$ in the
high-energy tails of distributions. Comparing the results for
$\mu^+\mu^-\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^-$ and $\mu^+\mu^-\mu^+\mu^-$ final states,
we find significant differences mainly in distributions that are sensitive to
the $\mu^+\mu^-$ pairing in the $\mu^+\mu^-\mu^+\mu^-$ final state. Differences
between $\mu^+\mu^-\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^-$ and $\mu^+\mu^-\mu^+\mu^-$
channels due to interferences of equal-flavour leptons in the final state can
reach up to $10\%$ in off-shell-sensitive regions. Contributions induced by
incoming photons, i.e. photon-photon and quark-photon channels, are included,
but turn out to be phenomenologically unimportant.

decades in economics and in computer science. More recently, there has been an
increased attention on mechanisms for two-sided markets, in which buyers and
sellers act strategically. For two-sided markets, an impossibility result of
Myerson and Satterthwaite states that no mechanism can simultaneously satisfy
individual rationality (IR), incentive compatibility (IC), strong
budget-balance (SBB), and be efficient. On the other hand, important
applications to web advertisement, stock exchange, and frequency spectrum
allocation, require us to consider two-sided combinatorial auctions in which
buyers have preferences on subsets of items, and sellers may offer multiple
heterogeneous items. No efficient mechanism was known so far for such two-sided
combinatorial markets. This work provides the first IR, IC and SBB mechanisms
that provides an O(1)-approximation to the optimal social welfare for two-sided
markets. An initial construction yields such a mechanism, but exposes a
conceptual problem in the traditional SBB notion. This leads us to define the
stronger notion of direct trade strong budget balance (DSBB). We then proceed
to design mechanisms that are IR, IC, DSBB, and again provide an
O(1)-approximation to the optimal social welfare. Our mechanisms work for any
number of buyers with XOS valuations - a class in between submodular and
subadditive functions - and any number of sellers. We provide a mechanism that
is dominant strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) if the sellers each have one
item for sale, and one that is bayesian incentive compatible (BIC) if sellers
hold multiple items and have additive valuations over them. Finally, we present
a DSIC mechanism for the case that the valuation functions of all buyers and
sellers are additive.

estimation of the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) in the context of

that the likelihood can be derived conveniently under the assumption of
independence between the random effects, but there has not been a clear
analysis of the merit or necessity of this method. For synthesis of diagnostic
test accuracy studies, a copula mixed model has been proposed in the
biostatistics literature. This general model includes the GLMM as a special
case and can also allow for flexible dependence modelling, different from
assuming simple linear correlation structures, normality and tail independence
in the joint tails. A maximum likelihood (ML) method, which is based on
evaluating the bi-dimensional integrals of the likelihood with quadrature
methods has been proposed, and in fact it eases any computational difficulty
that might be caused by the double integral in the likelihood function. Both
methods are thoroughly examined with extensive simulations and illustrated with
data of a published meta-analysis. It is shown that the ML method has no
non-convergence issues or computational difficulties and at the same time
allows estimation of the dependence between study-specific sensitivity and
specificity and thus prediction via summary receiver operating curves.

binary labels that indicate the presence/absence of an object in an image.
First, the probabilistic contribution of each image region to the confidence of

produce top-down saliency. From a set of saliency maps of an image produced by
fast bottom-up saliency approaches, we select the best saliency map suitable
for the top-down task. The selected bottom-up saliency map is combined with the
top-down saliency map. Features having high combined saliency are used to train
a linear SVM classifier to estimate feature saliency. This is integrated with
combined saliency and further refined through a multi-scale
superpixel-averaging of saliency map. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed weakly supervised topdown saliency and achieve comparable performance
with fully supervised approaches. Experiments are carried out on seven

particles across the mean field direction in turbulent plasmas as diffusion.
However, recent studies suggest that at short time-scales, such as soon after
solar energetic particle (SEP) injection, particles remain on turbulently
meandering field lines, which results in non-diffusive initial propagation
across the mean magnetic field. In this work, we use a new technique to
investigate how the particles are displaced from their original field lines,
and quantify the parameters of the transition from field-aligned particle
propagation along meandering field lines to particle diffusion across the mean
magnetic field. We show that the initial decoupling of the particles from the
field lines is slow, and particles remain within a Larmor radius from their
initial meandering field lines for tens to hundreds of Larmor periods, for
0.1-10 MeV protons in turbulence conditions typical of the solar wind at 1~AU.
Subsequently, particles decouple from their initial field lines and after
hundreds to thousands of Larmor periods reach time-asymptotic diffusive
behaviour consistent with particle diffusion across the mean field caused by
the meandering of the field lines. We show that the typical duration of the
pre-diffusive phase, hours to tens of hours for 10 MeV protons in 1~AU solar
wind turbulence conditions, is significant for SEP propagation to 1~AU and must
be taken into account when modelling SEP propagation in the interplanetary
space.

investigate a weighted sum-rate maximization problem subject to the
transmitting power constraints as well as a total cost constraint using
successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. A zero-forcing (ZF) based
suboptimal scheme that requires only local CSIs for the EAPs to obtain their
optimum receive beamforming is also derived. Various tradeoffs between the
weighted sum-rate and other system parameters are provided in numerical results

more reliable and formally verifiable communication networks. However, this
paper shows that the separation of the control plane from the data plane, which

malicious switch in the data plane or a host connected to the network) can use
teleportation to transmit information via the control plane and bypass critical
network functions in the data plane (e.g., a firewall), and to violate security
policies as well as logical and even physical separations. This paper
characterizes the design space for teleportation attacks theoretically, and
then identifies four different teleportation techniques. We demonstrate and
discuss how these techniques can be exploited for different attacks (e.g.,
exfiltrating confidential data at high rates), and also initiate the discussion
of possible countermeasures. Generally, and given today's trend toward more
intent-based networking, we believe that our findings are relevant beyond the
use cases considered in this paper.

his/her first-person video. A key challenge lies in the fact that the
evaluation metric is highly subjective and specific to a particular evaluator.
We leverage the first-person camera to address this challenge. The
spatiotemporal visual semantics provided by a first-person view allows us to
reason about the camera wearer's actions while he/she is participating in an
unscripted basketball game. Our method takes a player's first-person video and
provides a player's performance measure that is specific to an evaluator's
preference.
  To achieve this goal, we first use a convolutional LSTM network to detect
atomic basketball events from first-person videos. Our network's ability to
zoom-in to the salient regions addresses the issue of a severe camera wearer's
head movement in first-person videos. The detected atomic events are then
passed through the Gaussian mixtures to construct a highly non-linear visual
spatiotemporal basketball assessment feature. Finally, we use this feature to
learn a basketball assessment model from pairs of labeled first-person
basketball videos, for which a basketball expert indicates, which of the two
players is better.
  We demonstrate that despite not knowing the basketball evaluator's criterion,
our model learns to accurately assess the players in real-world games.
Furthermore, our model can also discover basketball events that contribute
positively and negatively to a player's performance.

the expected spatial structure of the given situation. These estimations are
efficiently updated by information gained as the system searches for relevant
objects, allowing the system to use context as it is discovered to narrow the

  More specifically, at any given time in a run on a test image, our system
uses image features plus contextual information it has discovered to identify a

generate an updated situation model in an on-line fashion, using an efficient

Transmission Electron Microscope (STEM) allows for nanoscale mapping of such
properties. However, typical STEM-EELS detection is limited to energy losses in
the eV range, which are too large for probing important low-energy excitation
such as phonons or mid-IR plasmons. Here we adapt a conventional STEM-EELS
system to probe energy loss down to 100 meV, and apply it to map phononic
states in h-BN, a representative van der Waals (vdW) material. The h-BN EELS
spectra, surprisingly, depend on the h-BN thickness and the distance of the
electron beam to h-BN flake edges. To explain this observation, we developed a
classical response theory describing the interaction of fast electrons with
(anisotropic) slabs of vdW materials. Theoretical and numerical calculations
perfectly match the experimental h-BN spectra, and reveal that the electron
loss is dominated by the excitation of hyperbolic phonon polaritons, and not of
bulk phonons as often reported. Thus, STEM-EELS offers the possibility to probe
low-energy polaritons in vdW materials, with our theory being of fundamental
importance for interpreting future experiments.

platforms, are recognized as a major factor in almost every social success and

they are inherently unpredictable, recent work has shown that some key
properties of information cascades, such as size, growth, and shape, can be
predicted by a machine learning algorithm that combines many features. These
predictors all depend on a bag of hand-crafting features to represent the
cascade network and the global network structure. Such features, always
carefully and sometimes mysteriously designed, are not easy to extend or to
generalize to a different platform or domain.
  Inspired by the recent successes of deep learning in multiple data mining
tasks, we investigate whether an end-to-end deep learning approach could
effectively predict the future size of cascades. Such a method automatically
learns the representation of individual cascade graphs in the context of the
global network structure, without hand-crafted features and heuristics. We find
that node embeddings fall short of predictive power, and it is critical to
learn the representation of a cascade graph as a whole. We present algorithms
that learn the representation of cascade graphs in an end-to-end manner, which
significantly improve the performance of cascade prediction over strong
baselines that include feature based methods, node embedding methods, and graph

interaction not only induces the orbital fluctuations, but also magnifies the
electron-boson coupling constant. Therefore, moderate orbital fluctuations give
strong attractive pairing interaction. (ii) The ""multi-fluctuation-exchange

iRobot's Roomba robot vacuum cleaner and Google's driverless cars have fired
the imagination of the general public, and social media buzz with speculation
about a utopian world of helpful robot assistants or the coming robot
apocalypse! However, there is a long way to go before autonomous systems reach
the level of capabilities required for even the simplest of tasks involving
human-robot interaction - especially if it involves communicative behaviour
such as speech and language. Of course the field of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) has made great strides in these areas, and has moved on from abstract
high-level rule-based paradigms to embodied architectures whose operations are
grounded in real physical environments. What is still missing, however, is an
overarching theory of intelligent communicative behaviour that informs
system-level design decisions in order to provide a more coherent approach to
system integration. This chapter introduces the beginnings of such a framework
inspired by the principles of Perceptual Control Theory (PCT). In particular,
it is observed that PCT has hitherto tended to view perceptual processes as a
relatively straightforward series of transformations from sensation to
perception, and has overlooked the potential of powerful generative model-based
solutions that have emerged in practical fields such as visual or auditory
scene analysis. Starting from first principles, a sequence of arguments is
presented which not only shows how these ideas might be integrated into PCT,
but which also extend PCT towards a remarkably symmetric architecture for a
needs-driven communicative agent. It is concluded that, if behaviour is the
control of perception, then perception is the simulation of behaviour.

consumer valuation of service for both the two- and multi-SP problems to show
that: (i) when consumers place a high value on privacy, it leads to a lower use
of private data by SPs (i.e., their advertised privacy risk reduces), and thus,
SPs compete on the QoS; (ii) SPs that are capable of differentiating on
services that do not directly target consumers gain larger market share; and
(iii) a higher valuation of privacy by consumers forces SPs with smaller
untargeted revenue to offer lower privacy risk to attract more consumers. The
work also illustrates the market segmentation problem for more than two SPs and
highlights the instability of such markets.

Fermi-Hubbard model is systematically studied for strong Hubbard interaction U
in the entire filling range using the density-matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) and the Bethe ansatz. For strong U, two holes at the same site form a
compound object whose decay is impeded by the lack of phase space. Still, a
partial decay is possible on an extremely short time scale where phase-space
arguments do not yet apply. We argue that the initial decay and the resulting
intermediate state are relevant for experiments performed with ultracold atoms
loaded into an optical lattice as well as for (time-resolved) CVV
Auger-electron spectroscopy. The detailed discussion comprises the mixed
ballistic-diffusive real-time propagation of the doublon through the lattice,
its partial decay on the short time scale as a function of filling and
interaction strength, as well as the analysis of the decay products, which are
metastable on the intermediate time scale that is numerically accessible and
which show up in the two-hole excitation (Auger) spectrum. The ambivalent role
of singly occupied sites is key to understanding the doublon physics: For high
fillings, ground-state configurations with single occupancies are recognized to
strongly relax the kinematic constraints and to open up decay channels. For
fillings close to half filling, however, their presence actually blocks the
doublon decay. Finally, the analysis of the continua in the two-hole spectrum
excludes a picture where the doublon decays into unbound electron holes for
generic fillings, different from the limiting case of the completely filled
band. We demonstrate that the decay products as well as the doublon propagation
should rather be understood in terms of Bethe ansatz eigenstates.

large fraction of the Galactic missing baryons. This circumgalactic medium
(CGM) is probed effectively in X-rays, both in absorption and in emission. The
CGM also appears to be anisotropic, so we have started a program to determine
CGM properties along several sightlines by combining absorption and emission
measurements. Here we present the emission measure close to the \mrk509
sightline using new \suzaku and \xmm observations. We also present new analysis
and modeling of \chandra HETG spectra to constrain the absorption parameters.
The emission measure in this sightline is high,
EM$=0.0165\pm0.0008\pm0.0006~$cm$^{-6}~$pc, five times larger than the average.
The observed \ovii column density N(\ovii)$= 2.35\pm0.4 \times
10^{16}$cm$^{-2}$, however, is close to the average. We find that the
temperature of the emitting and absorbing gas is the same: $\log T (\rm K) =
6.33\pm0.01$ and $\log T (\rm K)=6.33\pm0.16$ respectively. We fit the observed
column density and emission measure with a $\beta-$model density profile. The
the central density is constrained to be between $n_0=2.8$--$6.0\times 10^{-4}$
cm$^{-3}$ and the core radius of the density profile has a lower limit of 40
kpc. This shows that the hot gas is mostly in the CGM of the galaxy, not in the
Galactic disk. Our derived density profile is close to the \citet{Maller2004}
profile for adiabatic gas in hydrostatic equilibrium with an NFW dark matter
potential well. Assuming this density profile, the minimum mass of the hot CGM
is $3.2 \times 10^{10}~$M$_{\odot}$.

models at low precision: by reducing precision, one can reduce computation and
communication by one order of magnitude. We examine training at reduced
precision, both from a theoretical and practical perspective, and ask: is it
possible to train models at end-to-end low precision with provable guarantees?
Can this lead to consistent order-of-magnitude speedups? We present a framework
called ZipML to answer these questions. For linear models, the answer is yes.
We develop a simple framework based on one simple but novel strategy called
double sampling. Our framework is able to execute training at low precision
with no bias, guaranteeing convergence, whereas naive quantization would
introduce significant bias. We validate our framework across a range of
applications, and show that it enables an FPGA prototype that is up to 6.5x
faster than an implementation using full 32-bit precision. We further develop a
variance-optimal stochastic quantization strategy and show that it can make a
significant difference in a variety of settings. When applied to linear models
together with double sampling, we save up to another 1.7x in data movement
compared with uniform quantization. When training deep networks with quantized
models, we achieve higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art XNOR-Net. Finally,
we extend our framework through approximation to non-linear models, such as
SVM. We show that, although using low-precision data induces bias, we can
appropriately bound and control the bias. We find in practice 8-bit precision
is often sufficient to converge to the correct solution. Interestingly,
however, in practice we notice that our framework does not always outperform
the naive rounding approach. We discuss this negative result in detail.

observation model error, in real applications, model error with nontrivial
biases is unavoidable. A practical example is the error in the radiative
transfer model (which is used to assimilate satellite measurements) in the
presence of clouds. As a consequence, many (in fact 99\%) of the cloudy
observed measurements are not being used although they may contain useful
information. This paper presents a novel nonparametric Bayesian scheme which is
able to learn the observation model error distribution and correct the bias in
incoming observations. This scheme can be used in tandem with any data
assimilation forecasting system. The proposed model error estimator uses
nonparametric likelihood functions constructed with data-driven basis functions

in the machine learning community. Numerically, we show positive results with
two examples. The first example is designed to produce a bimodality in the
observation model error (typical of ""cloudy"" observations) by introducing
obstructions to the observations which occur randomly in space and time. The
second example, which is physically more realistic, is to assimilate cloudy

star o Cet (Mira A). In search of AlO, we mined data obtained with APEX, the
IRAM 30m telescope, Herschel/HIFI, SMA, and ALMA, which were primarily aimed at
studying other molecular species. We report here on observations of AlO towards
a sample of eight oxygen-rich AGB stars in different rotational transitions, up
to seven for some stars. We present definite detections of one rotational
transition of AlO for o Cet and R Aqr, and tentative detections of one
transition for R Dor and o Cet, and two for IK Tau and W Hya. The presented
spectra of WX Psc, R Cas, and TX Cam show no signature of AlO. For o Cet, R
Aqr, and IK Tau, we find that the AlO(N=9-8) emission likely traces the inner
parts of the wind, out to only a few tens of AU, where the gas has not yet
reached its terminal velocity. The conclusive detections of AlO emission in the
case of o Cet and R Aqr confirm the presence of AlO gas in outflows of AGB
stars. The tentative detections further support this. Since most of the
observations presented in this study were obtained with stronger emission from
other species than AlO in mind, observations with higher sensitivity in
combination with high angular resolution will improve our understanding of the
presence and behaviour of AlO. From the current data sets we cannot firmly
conclude whether there is a direct correlation between the wind properties and
the detection rate of AlO emission. We hope that this study can serve as a
stimulus to perform sample studies in search of AlO in oxygen-rich outflows.

communication devices is their quantum capacity. It has been studied for
arbitrary kinds of quantum channels, but its practical estimation has so far
been limited to devices that implement independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) quantum channels, where each qubit is affected by the same noise
process. Real devices, however, typically exhibit correlated errors.
  Here, we overcome this limitation by presenting protocols that estimate a
channel's one-shot quantum capacity for the case where the device acts on (an
arbitrary number of) qubits. The one-shot quantum capacity quantifies a
device's ability to store or communicate quantum information, even if there are
correlated errors across the different qubits.
  We present a protocol which is easy to implement and which comes in two
versions. The first version estimates the one-shot quantum capacity by
preparing and measuring in two different bases, where all involved qubits are
used as test qubits. The second version verifies on-the-fly that a channel's
one-shot quantum capacity exceeds a minimal tolerated value while storing or
communicating data, therefore combining test qubits and data qubits in one
protocol. We discuss the performance of our method using simple examples, such
as the dephasing channel for which our method is asymptotically optimal.
Finally, we apply our method to estimate the one-shot capacity in an experiment
using a transmon qubit.

by the application of an oscillating magnetic field that is parallel to the

made more than two orders of magnitude larger than the cross section in the

universal description that is independent of the atomic species. To arrive at
these conclusions, we first develop a formal extension of Floquet theory to
describe scattering of atoms with time-periodic, short-range interaction
potentials. We then calculate the atomic scattering properties by modeling the
atomic interactions with a square well potential with oscillating depth and
then explicitly solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. We then apply
the Floquet formalism to the case of atoms scattering with a contact
interaction described by a time-periodic scattering length, obtaining analytic
results that agree with those obtained by solving the time-dependent
Schrodinger equation.

use of NOMA can prevent those multicasting receivers intercepting the

comparable efficiency to parametric methods in identifying underlying dynamics,

  These two issues are the subject of this paper. We propose a multi-stage
cyberbullying detection solution that drastically reduces the classification
time and the time to raise cyberbullying alerts. The proposed solution is
highly scalable, does not sacrifice accuracy for scalability, and is highly
responsive in raising alerts. The solution is comprised of three novel
components, an initial predictor, a multilevel priority scheduler, and an
incremental classification mechanism. We have implemented this solution and
utilized data obtained from the Vine online social network to demonstrate the
utility of each of these components via a detailed performance evaluation. We
show that our complete solution is significantly more scalable and responsive
than the current state-of-the-art.

0.32 pc) thus not covering entirely the broad line region and is located at
$\ge$ 39 pc from the central active galactic nucleus (AGN). Although the DLA is
slightly redshifted relative to the quasar, its metallicity
([S/H]=$-$0.41$\pm$0.30) is intermediate between what is expected from
infalling and outflowing gas. It could be possible that the DLA is part of some
infalling material accreting onto the quasar host galaxy through filaments, and
that its metallicity is raised by mixing with the enriched outflowing gas
emanating from the central AGN. Current DLA surveys miss these 'ghostly' DLAs,
and it would be important to quantify the statistics of this population by
searching the SDSS database using metal absorption templates.

Based on these predictions, we attempt to synthesize Cs$_2$InAgCl$_6$ and

Cs$_2$InAgCl$_6$. X-ray diffraction yields a double perovskite structure with
space group $Fm\overline{3}m$. The measured band gap is 3.3 eV, and the
compound is found to be photosensitive and turns reversibly from white to
orange under ultraviolet illumination. We also perform an empirical analysis of
the stability of Cs$_2$InAgX$_6$ and their mixed halides based on Goldschmidt's
rules, and we find that it should also be possible to form
Cs$_2$InAg(Cl$_{1-x}$Br$_{x}$)$_6$ for $x<1$. The synthesis of mixed halides

undirected $n$-vertex graph $G$, and a collection
$\mathcal{M}=\{(s_1,t_1),\ldots,(s_k,t_k)\}$ of pairs of its vertices, called
source-destination, or demand, pairs. The goal is to route the largest possible
number of the demand pairs via node-disjoint paths. The best current
approximation for the problem is achieved by a simple greedy algorithm, whose
approximation factor is $O(\sqrt n)$, while the best current negative result is
an $\Omega(\log^{1/2-\delta}n)$-hardness of approximation for any constant
$\delta$, under standard complexity assumptions. Even seemingly simple special
cases of the problem are still poorly understood: when the input graph is a
grid, the best current algorithm achieves an $\tilde O(n^{1/4})$-approximation,
and when it is a general planar graph, the best current approximation ratio of
an efficient algorithm is $\tilde O(n^{9/19})$. The best currently known lower
bound on the approximability of both these versions of the problem is
APX-hardness.
  In this paper we prove that NDP is $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})}$-hard to

Although the optimal scaling method was developed initially for variables with
a limited number of categories, optimal transformations of continuous variables
are a special case. We will consider a variety of transformation types;
typically we use step functions for categorical variables, and smooth (spline)
functions for continuous variables. Both types of functions can be restricted

optimal scaling, three regularization methods will be considered: Ridge

ROS Regression (Regularized Optimal Scaling Regression. We will show that the

results from the two methods agree reasonably well. Many of the shell galaxies
in our sample appear to have lower central $\mathrm{Mg}_{2}$ index values than
non-shell galaxies of the same central velocity dispersion, which is likely due
to a past interaction event. Our shell galaxy sample shows a relation between
central metallicity and velocity dispersion that is consistent with previous
samples of non-shell galaxies. Analyzing the metallicity gradients in our
sample, we find an average metallicity gradient of -0.16$\pm$0.10 dex per
decade in radius. We compare this with formation models to constrain the
merging history of shell galaxies. We argue that our galaxies likely have
undergone major mergers in their past but it is unclear whether the shells
formed from these events or from separate minor mergers. Additionally, we find
evidence for young stellar populations ranging in age from 500 Myr to 4--5 Gyr

active research for half a century now. Early experiments demonstrated a
remarkable rise in the critical temperature, $T_{c}$, with reducing grain size
in a variety of materials. In two dimensional diffusive superconductors,
$T_{c}$ is decreased due to enhanced Coulomb repulsion. We propose that in
finite size grains, the diffusive enhancement of the Coulomb repulsion is
weakened and leads ultimately to an increase in $T_{c}$ in isolated, disordered
two dimensional grains. Our mechanism is superimposed on the possible
enhancement in $T_{c}$ due to the change in the density of states of finite

population storage in Zeeman sublevels of Nd$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$. The lifetime
is measured as a function of magnetic field strength and orientation,
temperature and Nd$^{3+}$ doping concentration. At the lowest temperature of 3
K we find a general trend where the lifetime is short at low field strengths,
then increases to a maximum lifetime at a few hundreds of mT, and then finally
decays rapidly for high field strengths. This behaviour can be modelled with a
relaxation rate dominated by Nd$^{3+}$-Nd$^{3+}$ cross relaxation at low fields
and spin lattice relaxation at high magnetic fields. The maximum lifetime
depends strongly on both the field strength and orientation, due to the
competition between these processes and their different angular dependencies.
The cross relaxation limits the maximum lifetime for concentrations as low as
30 ppm of Nd$^{3+}$ ions. By decreasing the concentration to less than 1 ppm we
could completely eliminate the cross relaxation, reaching a lifetime of 3.8 s
at 3~K. At higher temperatures the spectral hole lifetime is limited by the
magnetic-field independent Raman and Orbach processes. In addition we show that
the cross relaxation rate can be strongly reduced by creating spectrally large
holes of the order of the optical inhomogeneous broadening. Our results are

flattens out for the overall galaxy population and satellites. For star-forming
galaxies only, the median SFR is constant at $z$ $\gtrsim$ 0.5 but declines by
$\sim$ 0.3-0.4 dex from the field to clusters for satellites and centrals at
$z$ $\lesssim$ 0.5. We argue that for satellites, the main role of the cosmic

centrals, it is mainly to control their overall SFR at $z$ $\lesssim$ 0.5 and
to set their fraction at $z$ $\gtrsim$ 0.5. We suggest that most satellites

reduces the direct detection rate at certain detector locations while
increasing the rate in others. The Earth's rotation induces a daily modulation
in the rate, which we find to be highly sensitive to the detector latitude and
to the form of the DM-nucleon interaction. These distinctive signatures would

$S$ we find three different symmetric $Z_2$ spin liquid phases, separated by
two continuous quantum phase transitions. Interestingly, the gap of elementary
excitations remains finite throughout the transitions. The first spin liquid
phase corresponds to the well known zero-flux state in the Heisenberg limit,
which is stable with respect to small Kitaev couplings and develops $120^\circ$

via shock waves is almost an order of magnitude higher than via turbulence.
Most of the shock waves in the simulation are very weak shocks with Mach
numbers smaller than 1.5, but the stronger shocks, although rare, dissipate
energy more effectively. We find that shock dissipation is a steep function of
radius, with most of the energy dissipated within 30 kpc, while radiative
cooling loses area less concentrated. However, adiabatic processes and mixing
(of post-shock materials and the surrounding gas) are able to redistribute the
heat throughout the core. A considerable fraction of the AGN energy also
escapes the core region. The cluster goes through cycles of AGN outbursts
accompanied by periods of enhanced precipitation and star formation, over Gyr
timescales. The cluster core is under-heated at the end of each cycle, but
over-heated at the peak of the AGN outburst. During the heating-dominant phase,
turbulent dissipation alone is often able to balance radiative cooling at every
radius but, when this is occurs, shock waves inevitably dissipate even more
energy. Our simulation explains why some clusters, such as Abell 2029, are
cooling dominated, while in some other clusters, such as Perseus, various
heating mechanisms including shock heating, turbulent dissipation and bubble
mixing can all individually balance cooling, and together, overheat the core.

color, probabilistic modeling, variability, and combinations of
color/probabilistic modeling with variability. We only considered objects that
appear as point sources in the DES images. We examine color selection methods
based on the WISE mid-IR W1-W2 color, a mixture of WISE and DES colors (g-i and
i-W1) and a mixture of VHS and DES colors (g-i and i-K). For probabilistic
quasar selection, we used XDQSOz, an algorithm that employs an empirical
multi-wavelength flux model of quasars to assign quasar probabilities. Our
variability selection uses the multi-band chi2-probability that sources are
constant in the DES Year 1 griz-band light curves. The completeness and
efficiency are calculated relative to an underlying sample of point sources
that are detected in the required selection bands and pass our data quality and
photometric error cuts. We conduct our analyses at two magnitude limits, i<19.8
mag and i<22 mag. For sources with W1 and W2 detections, the W1-W2 color or
XDQSOz method combined with variability gives the highest completenesses of
>85% for both i-band magnitude limits and efficiencies of >80% to the bright
limit and >60% to the faint limit; however, the giW1 and giW1+variability
methods give the highest quasar surface densities. The XDQSOz method and
combinations of W1W2/giW1/XDQSOz with variability are among the better
selection methods when both high completeness and high efficiency are desired.

1$h^{-1}\rm{Gpc}$ MultiDark Planck cosmological simulation and generate
light-cones with the SUrvey GenerAtoR algorithm. To interpret our results, we
adopt a modified (Sub)Halo Abundance Matching scheme, accounting for the
stellar mass incompleteness of the emission line galaxies. The satellite
fraction constitutes an extra parameter in this model and allows to optimize
the clustering fit on both small and intermediate scales (i.e. $r_p\lesssim
30h^{-1}\rm{Mpc})$, with no need of any velocity bias correction. We find that,
in the local Universe, the $\left[\mathrm{O\scriptsize{II}}\right]$ luminosity
correlates with all the clustering statistics explored and with the galaxy
bias. This latter quantity correlates more strongly with the SDSS $r$-band
magnitude than $\left[\mathrm{O\scriptsize{II}}\right]$ luminosity. In
conclusion, we propose a straightforward method to produce reliable clustering
models, entirely built on the simulation products, which provides robust
predictions of the typical ELG host halo masses and satellite fraction values.
The SDSS galaxy data, MultiDark mock catalogues and clustering results are made
publicly available.

binary that shows evidence of a circumbinary disk. The system displays complex
photometric and spectroscopic variability over a range of timescales and
wavelengths. Using two optical CoRoT runs, and infrared Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5
$\mu$m observations (simultaneous with the second CoRoT run), we model the
out-of-eclipse light curves. The large scale structure in both CoRoT light
curves is consistent with the constructive and destructive interference of
starspot signals at two slightly different periods. Using the stellar $v\sin i$
's, we infer different rotation periods: the primary is consistent with
synchronisation and the secondary is slightly supersynchronous. Comparison of
the raw data to the residuals of our spot model in colour-magnitude space
indicates additional contributions consistent with variable dust emission and
obscuration. We also identify short-duration flux dips preceding secondary
eclipse in all three CoRoT and Spitzer bands. We construct a model of the inner
regions of the binary and propose that these dips could be caused by partial
occultation of the central binary by the accretion stream onto the primary
star. Analysis of 15 VLT/FLAMES H$\alpha$ profiles reveal an emission profile
associated with each star: the majority is consistent with chromospheric
emission but higher velocity emission is also seen, which could be due to
prominences or accretion-related phenomena. In addition, simultaneous u and
r-band observations from CFHT/MEGACam reveal a short-lived u-band excess
consistent with either an accretion hot spot or stellar flare. The photometric
and spectroscopic variations are complex but are consistent with the picture of
two active stars possibly undergoing non-steady, low-level accretion; the
system's very high inclination provides a new view of such variability.

determining stellar parameters against independent measurements of effective
temperatures from angular diameter measurements and surface gravities from
asteroseismology. In this first paper we present the method used to determine
the stellar parameters as well as the elemental abundances, evaluate them, and
present the results for our local disk sample of 291 giants. When comparing our
determined spectroscopic temperatures to those derived from angular diameter

a standard deviation of 0.12 dex. When it comes to the abundance trends, our

breaking potential is already quite well established. However, despite being a
key ingredient to a fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanism of
electroweak symmetry breaking, the global structure of the electroweak
potential remains entirely unknown. The existence of sphalerons, unstable
solutions of the classical action of motion that are interpolating between
topologically distinct vacua, is a direct consequence of the Standard Model's
$\mathrm{SU}(2)_L$ gauge group. Nevertheless, the sphaleron energy depends on
the shape of the Higgs potential away from the minimum and can therefore be a
litmus test for its global structure. Focusing on two scenarios, the minimal
composite Higgs model $\mathrm{SO}(5)/\mathrm{SO}(4)$ or an elementary Higgs
with a deformed electroweak potential, we calculate the change of the sphaleron

energy would have to be measured to $\mathcal{O}(10)\%$ accuracy to exclude
sizeable global deviations from the Standard Model Higgs potential. We further
find that because of the periodicity of the scalar potential in composite Higgs
models a second sphaleron branch with larger energy arises.

fundamental difference between the capillary waves ($\sigma=1, g=0$) and the
gravity-capillary waves ($\sigma=1,$ $ 0< g< 3$) in the finite depth setting.
As, for the later case, there exists arbitrary small $L^2$ traveling waves.
  Different from the water waves system in the infinite depth setting, the
quadratic terms of the same system in the finite depth setting are worse due to
the absence of null structure inside the Dirichlet-Neumann operator. In the
finite depth setting, the capillary waves system has the worst quadratic terms
among the water waves systems with all possible values of gravity effect
constant and surface tension coefficient. It loses favorable cancellations not
only in the High $\times$ Low type interaction but also in the High $\times $
High type interaction.
  In the worst scenario, the best decay rate of the nonlinear solution that one
could expect is $ (1+t) ^ {-1/2} $, because the $3D$ finite depth capillary
waves system lacks null structures and there exists $Q(u, \bar{u})$ type
quadratic term, which causes a very large time resonance set and the definite
growth of the associated profile. As a result, the problematic terms are not
only the quadratic terms but also the cubic terms.
  To prove global regularity for the capillary waves system, we identify a good
variable to prove the dispersion estimate, fully exploit the hidden structures

chemical maps using different sets of spectral lines and making different

experiments demonstrate that a modern DI code successfully recovers the input
chemical spot distributions comprised of multiple circular spots at different
latitudes or an element overabundance belt at the magnetic equator. For the
optimal reconstruction the average reconstruction errors do not exceed ~0.10
dex. The errors increase to about 0.15 dex when abundance distributions are
recovered from a few and/or blended spectral lines. Ignoring a 2.5 kG dipolar
magnetic field in chemical abundance DI leads to an average relative error of
0.2 dex and maximum errors of 0.3 dex. Similar errors are encountered if a DI
inversion is carried out neglecting a non-uniform continuum brightness
distribution and variation of the local atmospheric structure. This series of
numerical DI simulations proves that inversions with simplifying assumptions of

lead to small Hellinger perturbations of the associated posterior measures. We
thus provide a mathematical foundation to the Bayesian learning of the order

translates all positive values to 1 and all negative values to zero. We present
sLLG-based simulations demonstrating the operation of a 32-bit adder with a
network of several hundred nanomagnets, exhibiting a remarkably precise
correlation: The input magnets {A} and {B} as well as the output magnets {S}
all fluctuate randomly and yet the quantity A+B-S is sharply peaked around
zero! If we fix {A} and {B}, the sum magnets {S} rapidly converge to a unique
state with S=A+B so that the system acts as an adder. But unlike standard
adders, the operation is invertible. If we fix {S} and {B}, the remaining

colliders, an extremely high-efficiency collimation system is required for safe
operation. At LHC, the major limiting locations in terms of particle losses on
superconducting (SC) magnets are the dispersion suppressors (DS) downstream of
the transverse collimation insertion. These losses are due to the protons
experiencing single diffractive interactions in the primary collimators. How to
solve this problem is very important for future proton-proton colliders, such
as the FCC-hh and SPPC. In this article, a novel method is proposed, which
arranges both the transverse and momentum collimation in the same long straight
section. In this way, the momentum collimation system can clean those particles
related to the single diffractive effect. The effectiveness of the method has
been confirmed by multi-particle simulations. In addition, SC quadrupoles with
special designs such as enlarged aperture and good shielding are adopted to
enhance the phase advance in the transverse collimation section, so that
tertiary collimators can be arranged to clean off the tertiary halo which
emerges from the secondary collimators and improve the collimation efficiency.
With one more collimation stage in the transverse collimation, the beam losses
in both the momentum collimation section and the experimental regions can be
largely reduced. Multi-particle simulation results with the MERLIN code confirm
the effectiveness of the collimation method. At last, we provide a protection
scheme of the SC magnets in the collimation section. The FLUKA simulations show
that by adding some special protective collimators in front of the magnets, the
maximum power deposition in the SC coils is reduced dramatically, which is
proven to be valid for protecting the SC magnets from quenching.

processes and yields continuous films at 400C without de-wetting in contrast to
pure Ni films. With increasing Cr content, the films become progressively
smoother with wider terraces. Ni5Cr alloy thin films have an rms surface
roughness of 3.63+/-0.75 nm while Ni33Cr thin film is smoother with an rms
roughness of only 0.29 +/-0.13 nm. The changes in film growth initiated by
alloying with Cr are due to changes in the interfacial chemistry which
favorably alters the initial adsorption of the metal atoms on MgO surface and
suggests a reduction of the Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier. The growth of smooth
Ni-Cr thin films with well-defined surface structure opens up a new pathway for
a wide range of surface science studies related to alloy performance.

how the AI agent's behavior is being perceived by the humans-in-the-loop. When
the agent's task plans are generated without such considerations, they may
often demonstrate inexplicable behavior from the human's point of view. This
problem may arise due to the human's partial or inaccurate understanding of the

cognitive load to more serious concerns of safety around a physical agent. In
this paper, we address this issue by modeling plan explicability as a function
of the distance between a plan that agent makes and the plan that human expects
it to make. We learn a regression model for mapping the plan distances to
explicability scores of plans and develop an anytime search algorithm that can
use this model as a heuristic to come up with progressively explicable plans.
We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in a simulated autonomous car

associated with rapidly spinning black holes (BHs). BH spin-up may result from
a number of processes, including accretion of matter onto the BH itself, and
catastrophic events such as BH-BH mergers. Aims. We study the intriguing
properties of the powerful (L_bol ~ 10^47 erg s^-1) radio-loud quasar 3C 186.
This object shows peculiar features both in the images and in the spectra.
Methods. We utilize near-IR Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images to study the
properties of the host galaxy, and HST UV and Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical
spectra to study the kinematics of the source. Chandra X-ray data are also used
to better constrain the physical interpretation. Results. HST imaging shows
that the active nucleus is offset by 1.3 +- 0.1 arcsec (i.e. ~11 kpc) with
respect to the center of the host galaxy. Spectroscopic data show that the
broad emission lines are offset by -2140 +-390 km/s with respect to the narrow
lines. Velocity shifts are often seen in QSO spectra, in particular in
high-ionization broad emission lines. The host galaxy of the quasar displays a
distorted morphology with possible tidal features that are typical of the late
stages of a galaxy merger. Conclusions. A number of scenarios can be envisaged
to account for the observed features. While the presence of a peculiar outflow
cannot be completely ruled out, all of the observed features are consistent
with those expected if the QSO is associated with a gravitational wave (GW)
recoiling BH. Future detailed studies of this object will allow us to confirm
this type of scenario and will enable a better understanding of both the
physics of BH-BH mergers and the phenomena associated with the emission of GW
from astrophysical sources.

possibility in the scalar channel. In the diquark-antidiquark model, a scalar
diquark is a compact object when its color and flavor structures are in
($\bar{\bm{3}}_c$, $\bar{\bm{3}}_f$). Assuming that all the quarks are in an
$S$-wave, the spin-0 tetraquark formed out of this scalar diquark has only one
spin configuration, $|J,J_{12},J_{34}\rangle=|000\rangle$, where $J$ is the
spin of the tetraquark, $J_{12}$ the diquark spin, $J_{34}$ the antidiquark
spin. In this construction of the scalar tetraquark, we notice that another
compact diquark with spin-1 in ($\bm{6}_c$, $\bar{\bm{3}}_f$) can be used
although it is less compact than the scalar diquark. The spin-0 tetraquark
constructed from this vector diquark leads to the spin configuration
$|J,J_{12},J_{34}\rangle=|011\rangle$. The two configurations, $|000\rangle$
and $|011\rangle$, are found to mix strongly through the color-spin
interaction. The physical states can be identified with certain mixtures of the
two configurations which diagonalize the hyperfine masses of the color-spin
interaction. Matching these states to two scalar resonances $a_0(980),
a_0(1450)$ or to $K^*_0(800), K^*_0(1430)$ depending on the isospin channel, we
find that their mass splittings are qualitatively consistent with the hyperfine
mass splittings which can support their tetraquark structure. To test our
mixing scheme further, we also construct the tetraquarks for $J=1,J=2$ with the
spin configurations, $|111\rangle$ and $|211\rangle$, and discuss possible
candidates in the physical spectrum.

local stellar environment. Two of the 31 stars have unusually high proper
motions. Of the remaining 29 stars we find that most objects in this sample
have velocities in very good agreement with model predictions of a circularly
rotating disk model. Indeed the excellent fit to the model implies that the
TGAS uncertainty estimates are likely overestimated. The fastest outliers in
this subsample contain the LBV R71 and a few other well known emission line
objects though in no case do we derive velocities consistent with fast (~100
km/s) runaways. Our results imply that R 71 in particular has a moderate
deviation from the local stellar velocity field (40 km/s) lending support to
the proposition that this object cannot have evolved as a normal single star
since it lies too far from massive star forming complexes to have arrived at
its current position during its lifetime. Our findings therefore strengthen the
case for this LBV being the result of binary evolution. Of the two stars with
unusually high proper motions we find that one, the isolated B1.5 Ia+
supergiant Sk-67 2 (HIP 22237), is a candidate hypervelocity star, the TGAS
proper motion implying a very large peculiar transverse velocity (~360 km/s)
directed radially away from the LMC centre. If confirmed, for example by Gaia

polarimetry of a radio-loud Lya nebula, B3 J2330+3927 at z=3.09, with an
embedded active galactic nucleus (AGN). The AGN lies near the blob's Lya

continuum) polarization in a grid of circular apertures of radius 0.6""
(4.4kpc), detecting a significant (>2sigma) polarization fraction P in nine
apertures and achieving strong upper-limits (as low as 2%) elsewhere. P
increases from <2% at ~5kpc from the blob center to ~17% at ~15-25kpc. The
detections are distributed asymmetrically, roughly along the nebula's major
axis. The polarization angles theta are mostly perpendicular to this axis.
Comparing the Lya flux to that of the continuum, and conservatively assuming
that the continuum is highly polarized (20-100%) and aligned with the total
polarization, we place lower limits on the polarization of the Lya emission
P(Lya) ranging from no significant polarization at ~5 kpc from the blob center

suitable for chondrule-forming collisions than potentially differentiated

planetesimals collide with each other. We also find that progenitors of

recover known potentials to validate the method. We then discuss how these
theories can model, in the high-temperature limit, the strong interaction and
General Relativity. For the strong interaction, the model recovers the known
phenomenology of the nearly static regime of heavy quarkonia. The model also
exposes a possible origin for the emergence of the confinement scale from the
approximately conformal Lagrangian. Aside from such possible insights, the main
purpose of addressing the strong interaction here --given that more
sophisticated approaches already exist-- is mostly to further verify the
pertinence of the model in the more complex case of General Relativity for
which non-perturbative methods are not as developed. The results have important
implications on the nature of Dark Matter. In particular, non-perturbative
effects naturally provide flat rotation curves for disk galaxies, without need
for non-baryonic matter, and explain as well other observations involving Dark
Matter such as cluster dynamics or the dark mass of elliptical galaxies.

matters, the constraint on properties of low-mass neutron stars are
theoretically investigated. Based on the well known fact that there is a big
gap between the neutron stars and white dwarfs in the mass-radius sequence of
compact stars, here we explicitly point out the forbidden region for the
central density and stellar radius to form a compact stars, that is, there is
no compact star in the nature having central density in the region from about
$10^{12}~kg/m^3$ to $10^{17}~kg/m^3$, and there is also no compact star having
a radius in the region from about 400 km to 2000 km. It is found that for a
low-mass neutron star with central densities at subnuclear densities, the
stellar mass is mainly determined by the softness of the EOS at the higher
density region ($ > 10^{16}~\textrm{kg.m}^{-3}$) while the stellar radius is
dependent on the softness of the EOS at lower density region ($ <
10^{16}~\textrm{kg.m}^{-3}$). For a stable neutron star with stellar mass near
the minimum mass, the Keplerian period is several hundred millisecond, the
moment of inertia is in an order of $10^{37} kg\cdot m^{2}$, and the surface
gravitational redshift is in an order of $10^{-4}$.

  Similarity Consensus and Hash Functions","Accepted to appear in Image and Vision Computing",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning hash functions/codes for similarity search over multi-view data is
attracting increasing attention, where similar hash codes are assigned to the
data objects characterizing consistently neighborhood relationship across
views. Traditional methods in this category inherently suffer three
limitations: 1) they commonly adopt a two-stage scheme where similarity matrix
is first constructed, followed by a subsequent hash function learning; 2) these
methods are commonly developed on the assumption that data samples with
multiple representations are noise-free,which is not practical in real-life
applications; 3) they often incur cumbersome training model caused by the
neighborhood graph construction using all $N$ points in the database ($O(N)$).
In this paper, we motivate the problem of jointly and efficiently training the
robust hash functions over data objects with multi-feature representations
which may be noise corrupted. To achieve both the robustness and training
efficiency, we propose an approach to effectively and efficiently learning
low-rank kernelized \footnote{We use kernelized similarity rather than kernel,
as it is not a squared symmetric matrix for data-landmark affinity matrix.}
hash functions shared across views. Specifically, we utilize landmark graphs to
construct tractable similarity matrices in multi-views to automatically
discover neighborhood structure in the data. To learn robust hash functions, a
latent low-rank kernel function is used to construct hash functions in order to
accommodate linearly inseparable data. In particular, a latent kernelized
similarity matrix is recovered by rank minimization on multiple kernel-based
similarity matrices. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-view datasets
validate the efficacy of our method in the presence of error corruptions.

galaxies share many similar attributes to clumpy, star-forming galaxies at high
redshift. Considering integrated Sloan Digital Sky Survey observations, trends
between attenuation and other galaxy properties for DYNAMO galaxies are well
matched to star-forming galaxies at high redshift. Integrated gas attenuations
of DYNAMO galaxies are 0.2-2.0 mags in the V-band, and the ratio of stellar
E(B-V) and gas E(B-V) is 0.78-0.08 (compared to 0.44 at low redshift). Four
highly star-forming DYNAMO galaxies were observed at H-alpha using the Hubble
Space Telescope and at Pa-alpha using integral field spectroscopy at Keck. The
latter achieve similar resolution (~0.8-1 kpc) to our HST imaging using
adaptive optics, providing resolved observations of gas attenuations of these
galaxies on sub-kpc scales. We find < 1.0 mag of variation in attenuation (at
H-alpha) from clump to clump, with no evidence of highly attenuated star
formation. Attenuations are in the range 0.3-2.2 mags in the V band, consistent
with attenuations of low redshift star-forming galaxies. The small spatial
variation on attenuation suggests that a majority of the star-formation
activity in these four galaxies occurs in relatively unobscured regions and,
thus, star-formation is well characterised by our H-alpha observations.

using the powerful mathematical language of multivector-valued differential
forms. In the approach, the gravitational coordinates are the 12 spatial
components of the line interval (the vierbein) including their antisymmetric
parts, and their 12 conjugate momenta. A feature of the proposed formalism is
that it allows Lorentz gauge freedoms to be imposed on the Lorentz connections
rather than on the vierbein, which may facilitate numerical integration in some
challenging problems. The 40 Hamilton's equations comprise 12 + 12 = 24
equations of motion, 10 constraint equations (first class constraints, which
must be arranged on the initial hypersurface of constant time, but which are
guaranteed thereafter by conservation laws), and 6 identities (second class
constraints). The 6 identities define a trace-free spatial tensor that is the
gravitational analog of the magnetic field of electromagnetism. If the
gravitational magnetic field is promoted to an independent field satisfying its
own equation of motion, then the system becomes the WEBB system, which is known
to be strongly hyperbolic. Some other approaches, including ADM, BSSN, WEBB,
and Loop Quantum Gravity, are translated into the language of

the observer can see from what they cannot see. The boundary of an observer's
spacetime in the presence of a black hole is not the true (future event)
horizon of the black hole, but rather the illusory horizon, the dimming,
redshifting surface of the star that collapsed to the black hole long ago. The
illusory horizon is the source of Hawking radiation seen by observers both
outside and inside the true horizon. The perceived acceleration (gravity) on
the illusory horizon sets the characteristic frequency scale of Hawking
radiation, even if that acceleration varies dynamically, as it must do from the
perspective of an infalling observer. The acceleration seen by a non-rotating
free-faller both on the illusory horizon below and in the sky above is
calculated for a Schwarzschild black hole. Remarkably, as an infaller
approaches the singularity, the acceleration becomes isotropic, and diverging
as a power law. The isotropic, power-law character of the Hawking radiation,
coupled with conservation of energy-momentum, the trace anomaly, and the
familiar behavior of Hawking radiation far from the black hole, leads to a
complete description of the quantum energy-momentum inside a Schwarzschild
black hole. The quantum energy-momentum near the singularity diverges as
$r^{-6}$, and consists of relativistic Hawking radiation and negative energy
vacuum in the ratio $3 : -2$. The classical back reaction of the quantum
energy-momentum on the geometry, calculated using the Einstein equations,
serves merely to exacerbate the singularity. All the results are consistent
with traditional calculations of the quantum energy-momentum in 1+1 spacetime
dimensions.

a frequency staircase, with different modes excited at different times or

continuous time, with the parameter updates $\theta_t$ satisfying a stochastic
differential equation. We prove that $\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \nabla \bar
g(\theta_t) = 0$ where $\bar g$ is a natural objective function for the
estimation of the continuous-time dynamics. The convergence proof leverages
ergodicity by using an appropriate Poisson equation to help describe the

electromagnetic, gravitational or acoustic types. If these elementary emitters
are synchronized, the resulting emission is coherent. Moreover, the faster the
emitters approach an observer, the more intense and directional their apparent
emission is, with associated frequency increase. Multi-stream flows
ubiquitously occur in media (such as with shock waves and jets in astrophysical
and laboratory plasmas) and produce fast moving density singularities, where
high concentration and synchronism can bring constructive interference.
However, a singularity emitting such characteristic coherent radiation has not
been demonstrated yet. We show this general phenomenon in laser-driven
relativistic plasma, which is an ideal medium for realizing these effects in
the laboratory under controllable conditions. Our experiments and simulations
reveal bright coherent soft x-ray radiation from nanoscale electron density
singularities in multi-stream plasma. They constitute a new compact x-ray
source of ultrashort duration, demanded in numerous applications. In general,
singularities can be bright sources of other types of traveling waves. Thus our
findings open new opportunities in different fields of science. For example,
gravitational wave generation, as proposed in ultrahigh-energy accelerators,
can be significantly enhanced by intentionally induced density singularities in
the particle bunches. Further, we anticipate that multi-stream flows in cosmic
media can produce intense bursts of coherent electromagnetic and/or
gravitational waves, especially at longer wavelengths which facilitate
constructive interference. We can then expect to observe more directional short
wavelength bursts from cosmic emitters approaching at relativistic speeds.
Thus, we present a new framework for interpreting a broad range of experimental
results.

implement radiofrequency filters to harness wide frequency coverage, large

strong immunity to electromagnetic interference. However, one crucial challenge
facing the photonic radiofrequency filter (PRF) is the less impressive
out-of-band rejection. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate a
tunable PRF with a record out-of-band rejection of 80 dB, which is 3 dB higher

selective polarization control and large narrow-band amplification enabled by
stimulated Brillouin scattering effect. In particular, this record rejection is
arduous to be achieved for a narrow passband (e.g., a few megahertz) and a high
finesse in a PRF. Moreover, the proposed PRF is an active one capable of
providing negligible insertion loss and even signal gain. Tunable central
frequency ranging from 2.1 to 6.1 GHz is also demonstrated. The proposed PRF
will provide an ultra-high noise or clutter suppression for harsh

lacunarities in density distributions. We use generalized fractal dimensions to
study the neutral hydrogen distribution (HI) during the epoch of reionization.
Using a semi-numeric model of ionized bubbles to generate the HI field, we
calculate the fractal dimensions for length scales $\sim 10 h^{-1}$ cMpc. We
find that the HI field displays significant multifractal behaviour and is not
consistent with homogeneity at these scales when the mass averaged neutral
fraction $\bar{x}_{\rm HI}^M \gtrsim 0.5$. This multifractal nature is driven
entirely by the shapes and distribution of the ionized regions. The sensitivity
of the fractal dimension to the neutral fraction implies that it can be used
for constraining reionization history. We find that the fractal dimension is
relatively less sensitive to the value of the minimum mass of ionizing haloes
when it is in the range $\sim 10^9 - 10^{10} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$. Interestingly,
the fractal dimension is very different when the reionization proceeds
inside-out compared to when it is outside-in. Thus the multifractal nature of
HI density field at high redshifts can be used to study the nature of
reionization.

exact posterior, even as a limit point. Thus, no matter how long VI is run, the
resulting approximation will not approach the exact posterior. We propose to
instead consider a more flexible approximating family consisting of all
possible finite mixtures of a parametric base distribution (e.g., Gaussian).
For efficient inference, we borrow ideas from gradient boosting to develop an
algorithm we call boosting variational inference (BVI). BVI iteratively
improves the current approximation by mixing it with a new component from the
base distribution family and thereby yields progressively more accurate
posterior approximations as more computing time is spent. Unlike a number of
common VI variants including mean-field VI, BVI is able to capture
multimodality, general posterior covariance, and nonstandard posterior shapes.

  Theorem","Added a link to the code",,,,"cs.SI cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Clique counts reveal important properties about the structure of massive
graphs, especially social networks. The simple setting of just 3-cliques
(triangles) has received much attention from the research community. For larger
cliques (even, say 6-cliques) the problem quickly becomes intractable because
of combinatorial explosion. Most methods used for triangle counting do not
scale for large cliques, and existing algorithms require massive parallelism to
be feasible.
  We present a new randomized algorithm that provably approximates the number
of k-cliques, for any constant k. The key insight is the use of (strengthenings
of) the classic Tur\'an's theorem: this claims that if the edge density of a
graph is sufficiently high, the k-clique density must be non-trivial. We define
a combinatorial structure called a Tur\'an shadow, the construction of which
leads to fast algorithms for clique counting.
  We design a practical heuristic, called TUR\'AN-SHADOW, based on this
theoretical algorithm, and test it on a large class of test graphs. In all
cases,TUR\'AN-SHADOW has less than 2% error, in a fraction of the time used by
well-tuned exact algorithms. We do detailed comparisons with a range of other
sampling algorithms, and find that TUR\'AN-SHADOW is generally much faster and
more accurate. For example, TUR\'AN-SHADOW estimates all cliques numbers up to
size 10 in social network with over a hundred million edges. This is done in
less than three hours on a single commodity machine.

indicate that the width of the collective-mode spectrum manifestly vanishes in

capable of evaluating S-ALOHA in terms of packet loss rate, throughput,
energy-efficiency and average number of transmissions. The proposed model is
able to facilitate dimensioning and design of S-ALOHA based LPWAN. The
comparison between simulation and analytical results confirms the accuracy of
our proposed model. The design guides about S-ALOHA based LPWAN deduced from
our model are: the imperfect power control can be positive with capture effect
and and appropriate transmit power diversity strategy. The transmit power
diversity strategy should be determined by jointly considering network charges
level, power control precision and capture ratio to achieve optimal performance
of S-ALOHA.

the Universe in a new way, rather than by testing a hypothesis or conducting an
investigation with planned outcomes. For example, of the 10 greatest
discoveries made by the Hubble Space Telescope, only one was listed in its key
science goals. So a telescope that merely achieves its stated science goals is
not achieving its potential scientific productivity. Several next-generation
astronomical survey telescopes are currently being designed and constructed
that will significantly expand the volume of observational parameter space, and
should in principle discover unexpected new phenomena and new types of object.
However, the complexity of the telescopes and the large data volumes mean that
these discoveries are unlikely to be found by chance. Therefore, it is
necessary to plan explicitly for these unexpected discoveries in the design and
construction of the telescope. Two types of discovery are recognised:
unexpected objects, and unexpected phenomena. This paper argues that
next-generation astronomical surveys require an explicit process for detecting
the unexpected, and proposes an implementation of this process. This
implementation addresses both types of discovery, and relies heavily on
machine-learning techniques, and also on theory-based simulations that
encapsulate our current understanding of the Universe to compare with the data.

for dimension reduction. The estimation of factor models has been actively
studied in various fields. In the first part of this paper, we present a new
approach to estimate high-dimensional factor models, using the empirical
spectral density of residuals. The spectrum of covariance matrices from
financial data typically exhibits two characteristic aspects: a few spikes and
bulk. The former represent factors that mainly drive the features and the
latter arises from idiosyncratic noise. Motivated by these two aspects, we
consider a minimum distance between two spectrums; one from a covariance
structure model and the other from real residuals of financial data that are
obtained by subtracting principal components. Our method simultaneously
provides estimators of the number of factors and information about correlation
structures in residuals. Using free random variable techniques, the proposed
algorithm can be implemented and controlled effectively. Monte Carlo
simulations confirm that our method is robust to noise or the presence of weak
factors. Furthermore, the application to financial time-series shows that our
estimators capture essential aspects of market dynamics.

boundaries on deformation behaviour of body-centred cubic (BCC) iron (Fe)
nanopillars. The twin boundaries varying from one to five providing twin
boundary spacing in the range 8.5 - 2.8 nm were introduced perpendicular to the
loading direction. The simulation results indicated that the twin boundaries in
BCC Fe play a contrasting role during deformation under tensile and compressive
loadings. During tensile deformation, a large reduction in yield stress was
observed in twinned nanopillars compared to perfect nanopillar. However, the
yield stress exhibited only marginal variation with respect to twin boundary
spacing. On the contrary, a decrease in yield stress with increase in twin
boundary spacing was obtained during compressive deformation. This contrasting
behaviour originates from difference in operating mechanisms during yielding
and subsequent plastic deformation. It has been observed that the deformation
under tensile loading was dominated mainly by twin growth mechanism, due to
which the twin boundaries offers a negligible resistance to slip of twinning
partials. This is reflected in the negligible variation of yield stress as a
function of twin boundary spacing. On the other hand, the deformation was
dominated by nucleation and slip of full dislocations under compressive
loading. The twin boundaries offer a strong repulsive force on full
dislocations resulting in the yield stress dependence on twin boundary spacing.
Further, it has been observed that the curved twin boundary can acts as a
source for full dislocation. The occurrence of twin-twin interaction during
tensile deformation and dislocation-twin interaction during compressive
deformation were presented and discussed.

closes the spin gap can be described as a magnon Bose-Einstein condensation

magnetic phase transitions, and has been extensively studied for the
spin-gapped systems. A large and ballistic spin thermal conductivity was
observed in the two-leg Heisenberg S = 1/2 ladder compounds. The characteristic
of magnetic thermal transport of the Haldane chain systems is quite
controversial on both the theoretical and experimental results. For the

well as its morphology and the properties of the quasars believed to drive it,
are still not well constrained. In this paper we present a new method to study
both He II reionization and quasars via the thermal proximity effect -- the
photoelectric heating of the intergalactic medium around quasars when their
hard radiation doubly ionizes helium. We post-process a SPH simulation with 1D
radiative calculations, and study how the thermal proximity effect depends on
the amount of singly ionized helium, $x_{\rm HeII,0}$, which prevailed in the
IGM before the quasar turned on, and the characteristic lifetime $t_{\rm Q}$
for which quasars shine. We find that the amplitude of the temperature boost in
the quasar environment depends on $x_{\rm HeII,0}$, with a characteristic value
of $\Delta T \simeq 10^4\,{\rm K}$ for an initially singly ionized IGM ($x_{\rm
HeII,0} = 1.0$), whereas the size of the thermal proximity zone is sensitive to
quasar lifetime $t_{\rm Q}$, with typical sizes of ~100 cMpc for luminous
quasars shining for $t_{\rm Q}=10^8$ yr. This temperature boost is manifest as
a change in the thermal broadening of H I absorption lines near the quasar. We
introduce a new method based on measuring the Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum
as a function of distance from the quasar, and conduct Bayesian MCMC analysis
to demonstrate that the thermal proximity effect should be easily detectable.
For a mock dataset of 50 quasars at z~4, we predict that one can measure
$x_{\rm HeII,0}$ to a precision $\approx 0.04$, and $t_{\rm Q}$ to a precision
of $\approx 0.1$ dex. By applying our formalism to existing high-resolution
Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra of quasars at $3.1 \lesssim z \lesssim 5.0$, one
should be able to detect the thermal proximity effect, and reconstruct the full

the principle of DFT and solving the numerical 1D time-independent
Schr\""odinger equation of electron and phonon simultaneously. Two different
lengths of branches A and B, are occupied alternatively to generate the
asymmetric carbon chain. The ratio of the asymmetric branch length,RAB=A/B,
plays an important role in the electronic density of states DOS around Fermi
level Ef . The highest DOS(Ef) occurs if the RAB equals to 2 and while the
Fermi level coincides with the Von-Hove singularity at RAB=3. The location of
the singularity point relative to the Ef is controllable via branch length
interestingly. By comparison with the symmetric case, tuning the branch length
asymmetrically shows a stronger impact to shift the Ef to the singularity
point. The numerical solution of the 1D time independent Schrodinger equation
of phonon indicates that the kink reinforces the charge fluctuations but the
fluctuations are minimized when the RAB goes up. Based on the simulation
results, the electron phonon coupling of the carbon nanowire decreases with
chain length. In comparison to the symmetric structure, the electron phonon
coupling of the asymmetric carbon chain is higher. The maximum electron phonon
coupling of the asymmetric carbon chain takes place at RAB=2 . However, the
weakening of the electron phonon coupling is observed owing to ultrahigh
concentration of kinks. The reduction of the electron phonon coupling of the

question has been addressed with respect to separability , the relation of the

find here, that there is a set containing density matrices which do not exhibit
Bell-CHSH violation under any factorization of the Hilbert space brought about

characterize the set in terms of a necessary and sufficient criterion based on

characterize such density matrices based on their bloch representations. For
some classes of density matrices, necessary and sufficient conditions are
derived in terms of bloch parameters. Furthermore, an estimation of the volume

applied to some well-known class of states in two qubits.Since, both local

inequivalence of the two operations(in terms of increasing Bell-CHSH violation)

  LSTM",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Effective image and sentence matching depends on how to well measure their
global visual-semantic similarity. Based on the observation that such a global
similarity arises from a complex aggregation of multiple local similarities
between pairwise instances of image (objects) and sentence (words), we propose
a selective multimodal Long Short-Term Memory network (sm-LSTM) for
instance-aware image and sentence matching. The sm-LSTM includes a multimodal
context-modulated attention scheme at each timestep that can selectively attend
to a pair of instances of image and sentence, by predicting pairwise
instance-aware saliency maps for image and sentence. For selected pairwise
instances, their representations are obtained based on the predicted saliency
maps, and then compared to measure their local similarity. By similarly
measuring multiple local similarities within a few timesteps, the sm-LSTM
sequentially aggregates them with hidden states to obtain a final matching
score as the desired global similarity. Extensive experiments show that our
model can well match image and sentence with complex content, and achieve the
state-of-the-art results on two public benchmark datasets.

local hard decisions on the transmitted symbol and then report these decisions
to a fusion center (FC). The FC combines the local hard decisions to make a
global decision using an N-out-of-K fusion rule. Two reporting scenarios,
namely, perfect reporting and noisy reporting, are considered. Closed-form
expressions are derived for the expected global error probability of the system
for both reporting scenarios. New approximated expressions are also derived for
the expected error probability. Convex constraints are then found to make the
approximated expressions jointly convex with respect to the decision thresholds
at the receivers and the FC. Based on such constraints, suboptimal convex
optimization problems are formulated and solved to determine the optimal
decision thresholds which minimize the expected error probability of the

performance is greatly improved by combining the detection information of
distributed receivers. They also reveal that the solutions to the formulated
suboptimal convex optimization problems achieve near-optimal global error

recent deep learning technologies, e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

However, learning an effective mapping from visual sequence space to language

Memory Model (M3) to describe videos, which builds a visual and textual shared
memory to model the long-term visual-textual dependency and further guide
global visual attention on described targets. Specifically, the proposed M3
attaches an external memory to store and retrieve both visual and textual

operations. First, text representation in the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

read out to guide an attention to select related visual targets. Then, the
selected visual information is written into the memory, which will be further
read out to the text decoder. To evaluate the proposed model, we perform
experiments on two publicly benchmark datasets: MSVD and MSR-VTT. The
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the

Non-Riemannian Spaces, so-called Green Book, Gromov presented a problem
regarding a metric measure space. Gromov posed the question Bound the expansion
coefficient from below in terms of the observable diameter. The overall aim of
the current study is to demonstrate the answer to this problem. To begin
solving this problem, the concentration of measure phenomenon on the metric
measure space must be considered. The concentration function to evaluate the
measure phenomenon is connected by the observable diameter and the expansion
coefficient. Furthermore, the procedure for our answer gives us the upper bound
for the expansion coefficient in terms of the observable diameter. Combining
the desired lower bound for the expansion coefficient with its upper bound, we
eventually obtain the upper bound for the observable diameter. Simultaneously,
this reasoning has enabled us to obtain the upper bound for the diameter of a
bounded metric measure space in terms of the expansion coefficient. We will
apply the above-mentioned results to a compact connected Riemannian manifold
with non-negative Ricci curvature, which makes the bounds more explicit. More
precisely, they are in terms of the doubling constant of the Riemannian measure
and the first non-trivial eigenvalue of the Laplacian on the Riemannian

firstly, a set of mid-level attribute features are discovered by novelly
designed detection layers, where a max-pooling based weakly-supervised object
detection technique is used to train these layers with only image-level labels
without the need of bounding box annotations of pedestrian attributes.
Secondly, attribute labels are predicted by regression of the detection
response magnitudes. Finally, the locations and rough shapes of pedestrian
attributes can be inferred by performing clustering on a fusion of activation
maps of the detection layers, where the fusion weights are estimated as the
correlation strengths between each attribute and its relevant mid-level
features. Extensive experiments are performed on the two currently largest

annealing reshapes them from flat islands into spheres, without any remarkable
surface migration or coalescence. On the other hand, we studied the In NPs
formation on the ITO thin films and on In/ITO bilayer structures, by varying
the H2 plasma exposure time and the substrate temperature. This led us to
postulate that the main role of H2 plasma is to release In atoms from ITO
surface. At low substrate temperature (100{\deg}C), In NPs grow on ITO surface
via a solid phase VW mode, similar to evaporated In thin films, while at
300{\deg}C, small In droplets preferentially nucleate along the ITO grain
boundaries where ITO reduction rate and atomic diffusion coefficient are higher
compared with the ITO grain surface. As the droplets grow larger and connect

X-ray binaries and microquasars. These objects are currently regarded as
excellent test beds for the understanding of high energy phenomena in stellar
systems. Methods. Potential targets of study are selected based on
cross-identification of the 3rd Fermi Large Area Telescope catalogue with
historical catalogues of luminous stars often found as optical counterparts in
known cases. Follow-up observations and analysis of multi-wavelength archival
data are later used to seek further proofs of association beyond the simple
positional agreement. Results. Current results enable us to present here the
case of the Fermi source 3FGL J0133.3+5930 where two peculiar objects have been
discovered inside its region of uncertainty. One of them is the star TYC
3683-985-1 (LS I +59 79) whose eclipsing binary nature is reported in this

a likely low-power Active Galactic Nucleus at z = 0:1143 \pm 0:0002. If this
second object is of blazar type, it could easily account for the observed
gamma-ray photon flux. However, this is not confirmed at present, thus
rendering still open the star system TYC 3683-985-1 as an alternative
counterpart candidate to the Fermi source.

by several ground-based observations to obtain optical lightcurves. We
reanalysed previously published Subaru-COMICS and AKARI-IRC observations and
merged them with a Spitzer-IRS data set. In addition, we used a large set of
Spitzer-IRAC observations obtained in the period Jan to May, 2013. The data set
includes two complete rotational lightcurves and a series of ten
""point-and-shoot"" observations. The almost spherical shape of the target
together with the insufficient lightcurve quality forced us to combine
radiometric and lightcurve inversion techniques in different ways to find the
object's key physical and thermal parameters. We find that the solution which
best matches our data sets leads to this C class asteroid having a retrograde
rotation with a spin-axis orientation of (lambda = 310-340 deg; beta = -40+/-15

the need for adaptive compliance by illustrating possible compliance concerns

and justify a process to support adaptive compliance that ex- tends the
traditional compliance management lifecycle with the activities of the

general form of the large $n$ expansion when the symbol is an indicator
function of either a single arc-interval or several arc-intervals with a
discrete rotational symmetry. Moreover, we prove that the coefficients in the
expansions can be reconstructed, up to some constants, from the Eynard-Orantin
topological recursion applied to some explicit spectral curves. In addition,
when the symbol is an indicator function of a single arc-interval, we provide
the corresponding normalizing constants using a Selberg integral and illustrate
the theoretical results with numeric simulations up to order
$o\left(\frac{1}{n^4}\right)$. We also briefly discuss the situation when the
number of arc-intervals increases with $n$, as well as more general Toeplitz

of $k$-valued logic into classes with the same minor complexities. These

subtle binding between water and a boron and nitrogen doped benzene derivative
(1,2-azaborine) we show how exact exchange can alter the binding conformation
within a complex. Benchmark values have been calculated for three orientations
of the water monomer on 1,2-azaborine from explicitly correlated quantum
chemical methods, and we have also used diffusion quantum Monte Carlo. For a
host of popular DFT exchange-correlation functionals we show that the lack of
exact exchange leads to the wrong lowest energy orientation of water on
1,2-azaborine. As such, we suggest that a high proportion of exact exchange and
the associated improvement in the electronic structure could be needed for the
accurate prediction of physisorption sites on doped surfaces and in complex
organic molecules. Meanwhile to predict correct absolute interaction energies
an accurate description of exchange needs to be augmented by dispersion
inclusive functionals, and certain non-local van der Waals functionals (optB88-
and optB86b-vdW) perform very well for absolute interaction energies. Through a
comparison with water on benzene and borazine (B$_3$N$_3$H$_6$) we show that
these results could have implications for the interaction of water with doped
graphene surfaces, and suggest a possible way of tuning the interaction energy.

buckled in a non- uniform manner giving it a flavor of a topologically

addressed two specific cases, viz., a perfectly periodic chain wrinkled in a
quasiperiodic Fibonacci pattern, and a quasiperiodic Fibonacci chain, where the
buckling also takes place in a Fibonacci pattern. The buckling brings distant
neighbors in the parent chain to close proximity, which is simulated by a
tunnel hopping amplitude. It is seen that, in the perfectly ordered case,
increasing the strength of the tunnel hopping (that is, bending the segments
more) absolutely continuous density of states is retained towards the edges of
the band, while the central portion becomes fragmented and host subbands of
narrowing widths containing extended, current carrying states, and multiple
isolated bound states formed as a result of the bending. A switching on and off
of the electronic transmission can thus be engineered by buckling. On the other
hand, in the second example of a quasiperiodic Fibonacci chain, imparting a
quasiperiodic buckling is found to generate continuous subband(s) destroying
the usual multifractality of the energy spectrum. We present exact results
based on a real space renormalization group analysis, that is corroborated by

images of a particular data set, the network should learn to generate visually
similar image samples for latent variables that are close to each other in the
latent space. For tasks such as image retrieval and image classification, it
may be useful to exploit the arrangement of the latent space by projecting
images into it, and using this as a representation for discriminative tasks.
GANs often consist of multiple layers of non-linear computations, making them
very difficult to invert. This paper introduces techniques for projecting image
samples into the latent space using any pre-trained GAN, provided that the
computational graph is available. We evaluate these techniques on both MNIST
digits and Omniglot handwritten characters. In the case of MNIST digits, we
show that projections into the latent space maintain information about the
style and the identity of the digit. In the case of Omniglot characters, we
show that even characters from alphabets that have not been seen during
training may be projected well into the latent space; this suggests that this
approach may have applications in one-shot learning.

this model, the set of active elements, i.e., those that must be covered at any
given time, can change due to element arrivals and departures. The goal is to
maintain an algorithmic solution that is competitive with respect to the
current optimal solution. This model is popular in both the dynamic algorithms
and online algorithms communities. The difference is in the restriction placed
on the algorithm: in dynamic algorithms, the running time of the algorithm
making updates (called update time) is bounded, while in online algorithms, the
number of updates made to the solution (called recourse) is limited.
  In this paper we show the following results: In the update time setting, we
obtain O(log n)-competitiveness with O(f log n) amortized update time, and
O(f^3)-competitiveness with O(f^2) update time. The O(log n)-competitive
algorithm is the first one to achieve a competitive ratio independent of f in
this setting. In the recourse setting, we show a competitive ratio of O(min{log
n,f}) with constant amortized recourse. Note that this matches the best offline
bounds with just constant recourse, something that is impossible in the
classical online model.
  Our results are based on two algorithmic frameworks in the fully-dynamic
model that are inspired by the classic greedy and primal-dual algorithms for
offline set cover. We show that both frameworks can be used for obtaining both
recourse and update time bounds, thereby demonstrating algorithmic techniques
common to these strands of research.

  (original paper) + 19 pages of appendixes",,,,"cs.PL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Choreographic programming is a programming-language design approach that
drives error-safe protocol development in distributed systems. Starting from a
global specification (choreography) one can generate distributed
implementations. The advantages of this top-down approach lie in the
correctness-by-design principle, where implementations (endpoints) generated
from a choreography behave according to the strict control flow described in
the choreography, and do not deadlock. Motivated by challenging scenarios in
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), we study how choreographic programming can cater
for dynamic infrastructures where not all endpoints are always available. We
introduce the Global Quality Calculus ($GC_q$), a variant of choreographic
programming for the description of communication systems where some of the
components involved in a communication might fail. GCq features novel operators
for multiparty, partial and collective communications. This paper studies the
nature of failure-aware communication: First, we introduce $GC_q$ syntax,
semantics and examples of its use. The interplay between failures and
collective communications in a choreography can lead to choreographies that
cannot progress due to absence of resources. In our second contribution, we
provide a type system that ensures that choreographies can be realized despite
changing availability conditions. A specification in $GC_q$ guides the
implementation of distributed endpoints when paired with global (session)
types. Our third contribution provides an endpoint-projection based methodology
for the generation of failure-aware distributed processes. We show the
correctness of the projection, and that well-typed choreographies with
availability considerations enjoy progress.

channel matrix is sparse with only a few non-zero entries. By leveraging the
advantage of sparseness, we propose an algorithm that iteratively detects the
exact locations and values of non-zero entries of the sparse channel matrix. At
each iteration, the locations are detected by the SMP, and values are estimated

Furthermore, we employ the Gaussian approximation for message densities under

simple method to predict the performance of the proposed algorithm. Numerical
experiments show that the proposed algorithm has much better performance than
the existing sparse estimators, especially when the channel is sparse. In

model}) introduced by Kliemann (2010), using the stability concept of

is a network formation game incorporating the robustness of a network under a
more or less targeted attack. In addition to bringing in the swap equilibrium
(SE) concept, we extend the model from an attack on the edges of the network to
an attack on its vertices. Vertex destruction can generally cause more harm and
tends to be more difficult to analyze.
  We prove structural results and linear upper bounds or super-linear lower
bounds on the social cost of SE under different attack scenarios. The most
complex case is when the vertex to be destroyed is chosen uniformly at random
from the set of those vertices where each causes a maximum number of player
pairs to be separated (called a max-sep vertex). We prove a lower bound on the
social cost of $\Omega(n^{3/2})$ for this case and initiate an understanding of
the structural properties of SE in this scenario. Namely, we prove that there
is no SE that is a tree and has only one max-sep vertex. We conjecture that
this result can be generalized, in particular we conjecture that there is no SE
that is a tree. On the other hand, we prove that if the vertex to be destroyed
is chosen uniformly at random from the set of \emph{all} vertices, then each SE
is a tree (unless it is two-connected). Our conjecture would imply that moving
from the uniform probability measure to a measure concentrated on the max-sep
vertices, means moving from no SE having a cycle (unless two-connected) to each
SE having a cycle. This would ask for a more detailed study of this transition
in future work.

resonant with the plasmonic system, re-radiates to the far-field by coupling
with the antenna due to the availability of plasmonic states. This increases
the local density of states (LDOS), effectively providing more, or alternate,
pathways for emission. Through the mapping of localized emission events from
single molecules close to plasmonic antennas, performed using far-field data,
one gains combined information on both the local EM field strength and the LDOS
available. The localization from these emission-coupled events generally do
not, therefore, report the real position of the molecules, nor the EM
enhancement distribution at the illuminating wavelength. Here we propose the
use of a large Stokes shift fluorescent molecule in order to spectrally
decouple the emission process of the dye from the plasmonic system, leaving
only the absorption strongly in resonance with the enhanced EM field in the

demonstrate that this technique provides an effective way of exploring either
the EM field or the LDOS with nanometre spatial resolution.

complicated scenarios, where expressions involve transposition, inversion,
matrices with given properties, and sequences. The computation of such
expressions makes use of a set of computational kernels that offer
functionality well beyond the simple matrix product. The challenge then shifts
from finding an optimal parenthesization to finding an optimal mapping of the

that a solution based on the minimization of scalar operations does not result
in the optimal solution in terms of execution time, and/or might be numerically
unstable. In this paper, we introduce a number of generalizations of the matrix

and/or fluency, with compelling research directed towards understanding the
contributions of the visual system. While dyslexia is not an oculomotor
disease, readers with dyslexia have shown different eye movements than
typically developing students during text reading. Readers with dyslexia
exhibit longer and more frequent fixations, shorter saccade lengths, more
backward refixations than typical readers. Furthermore, readers with dyslexia
are known to have difficulty in reading long words, lower skipping rate of
short words, and high gaze duration on many words. It is an open question
whether it is possible to harness these distinctive oculomotor scanning
patterns observed during reading in order to develop a screening tool that can
reliably identify struggling readers, who may be candidates for dyslexia. Here,
we introduce a novel, fast, objective, non-invasive method, named Rapid
Assessment of Difficulties and Abnormalities in Reading (RADAR) that screens
for features associated with the aberrant visual scanning of reading text seen
in dyslexia. Eye tracking parameter measurements that are stable under retest
and have high discriminative power, as indicated by their ROC curves, were
obtained during silent text reading. These parameters were combined to derive a
total reading score (TRS) that can reliably separate readers with dyslexia from
typical readers. We tested TRS in a group of school-age children ranging from

for quantum dynamics remains a challenging topic of fundamental and practical

$\tau$, we obtain the statistics of first detection events for quantum dynamics
on a lattice, with the detector located at the origin. A quantum renewal
equation for a first detection wave function, in terms of which the first
detection probability can be calculated, is derived. This formula gives the
relation between first detection statistics and the solution of the
corresponding Schr\""odinger equation in the absence of measurement. We
demonstrate our results with tight binding quantum walk models. We examine a
closed system, i.e. a ring, and reveal the intricate influence of the sampling
time $\tau$ on the statistics of detection, discussing the quantum Zeno effect,
half dark states, revivals and optimal detection. The initial condition
modifies the statistics of a quantum walk on a finite ring in surprising ways.
In some cases the average detection time is independent of the sampling time
while in others the average exhibits multiple divergences as the sampling time
is modified. For an unbounded one dimensional quantum walk the probability of
first detection decays like $(\mbox{time})^{(-3)}$ with superimposed
oscillations, with exceptional behavior when the sampling period $\tau$ times
the tunnelling rate $\gamma$ is a multiple of $\pi/2$. The amplitude of the
power law decay is suppressed as $\tau\to 0$ due to the Zeno effect. Our work

play an important role, yet the accuracy of widely used empirical force fields
(FF) and density functional theory (DFT) exchange-correlation functionals is
often unclear in adsorption systems dominated by weak interactions. Herein we
present results from quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) for water and methanol
adsorption on the prototypical clay kaolinite. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first time QMC has been used to investigate adsorption at a
complex, natural surface such as a clay. As well as being valuable in their own
right, the QMC benchmarks obtained provide reference data against which the
performance of cheaper DFT methods can be tested. Indeed using various DFT
exchange-correlation functionals yields a very broad range of adsorption
energies, and it is unclear a priori which evaluation is better. QMC reveals
that in the systems considered here it is essential to account for van der
Waals (vdW) dispersion forces since this alters both the absolute and relative
adsorption energies of water and methanol. We show, via FF simulations, that
incorrect relative energies can lead to significant changes in the interfacial
densities of water and methanol solutions at the kaolinite interface. Despite
the clear improvements offered by the vdW-corrected and the vdW-inclusive
functionals, absolute adsorption energies are often overestimated, suggesting
that the treatment of vdW forces in DFT is not yet a solved problem.

$M$ travelling within a uniform gaseous, opaque medium at constant velocity
$V$. The perturber irradiates the surrounding gas with luminosity $L$. The
diffusion of the heat released is modelled with a uniform thermal diffusivity
$\chi$. Using linear perturbation theory, we show that the force exerted by the
perturbed gas on the perturber differs from the force without radiation (or
standard dynamical friction). Hot, underdense gas trails the mass, which gives
rise to a new force component, the heating force, with direction $+V$, thus
opposed to the standard dynamical friction. In the limit of low Mach numbers,
the heating force has expression $F_\mathrm{heat}=\gamma(\gamma-1)GML/(2\chi
c_s^2)$, $c_s$ being the sound speed and $\gamma$ the ratio of specific heats.
In the limit of large Mach numbers, $F_\mathrm{heat}=(\gamma-1)GML/(\chi
V^2)f(r_\mathrm{min}V/4\chi)$, where $f$ is a function that diverges
logarithmically as $r_\mathrm{min}$ tends to zero. Remarkably, the force in the
low Mach number limit does not depend on the velocity. The equilibrium speed,
when it exists, is set by the cancellation of the standard dynamical friction
and heating force. In the low Mach number limit, it scales with the luminosity
to mass ratio of the perturber. Using the above results suggests that Mars- to
Earth-sized planetary embryos heated by accretion in a gaseous protoplanetary
disc should have eccentricities and inclinations that amount to a sizeable
fraction of the disc's aspect ratio, for conditions thought to prevail at a few
astronomical units.

being explored to grow well-oriented PZT thin films to harvest a large

significantly reduced compared to intrinsic response due to substrate induced
clamping, even when films are well-oriented. Here, a novel method is presented
to grow preferentially (100)-oriented PZT films on glass substrates by
utilizing crystalline nanosheets as seed layers. Furthermore, increasing the
repetition frequency up to 20 Hz during pulsed laser deposition helps to tune
the film microstructure to hierarchically ordered columns that leads to reduced
clamping and enhanced piezoelectric response evidenced by transmission electron
microscopy and analytical calculations. A large piezoelectric response of 280
pm/V is observed in optimally tuned structure which almost triples the highest
reported piezoelectric response on glass. To confirm that the clamping
compromises the piezoelectric response, denser films are deposited using a
lower repetition frequency and a $BiFeO_{3}$ buffer layer resulting in
significantly reduced piezoelectric responses. This paper demonstrates a novel
method for PZT integration on glass substrates without compromising the large
piezoelectric response.

to the initially occupied sites for a time that scales as a high power of the

time-domain formulation is complementary to the formulation of the many-body
localization of all stationary states with a large localization length. The
long localization lifetime is achieved by constructing a periodic sequence of
site energies with a large period in a one-dimensional chain. The scaling of
the localization lifetime is independent of the number of particles for a broad
range of the coupling strength. The analytical results are confirmed by
numerical calculations.

formulated by John Moffat in 2006. In this work, we derive matter-sourced

predictions about stellar structure in the strong gravity regime. Specifically,
we represent spacetime with a static, spherically symmetric manifold, and model
the stellar matter content with a perfect fluid energy-momentum tensor. We then
derive the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in STVG and integrate
it for different equations of state. We find that STVG allows heavier neutron
stars than General Relativity (GR). Maximum masses depend on a normalized
parameter that quantifies the deviation from GR. The theory exhibits unusual
predictions for extreme values of this parameter. We conclude that STVG admits
suitable spherically symmetric solutions with matter sources, relevant for
stellar structure. Since recent determinations of neutron stars masses violate
some GR predictions, STVG appears as a viable candidate for a new gravity
theory.

study the aerodynamics of natural and man-made flyers. Vortex methods have been
extensively applied to reduce the dimensionality of these aerodynamic models,
based on the proper estimation of the strength and distribution of the vortices
in the wake. In such modeling approaches, one of the most fundamental questions
is how the vortex sheets are generated and released from sharp edges. To
determine the formation of the trailing-edge vortex sheet, the classical Kutta
condition can be extended to unsteady situations by realizing that a flow
cannot turn abruptly around a sharp edge. This condition can be readily applied
to a flat plate or an airfoil with cusped trailing edge since the direction of
the forming vortex sheet is known to be tangential to the trailing edge.
However, for a finite-angle trailing edge, or in the case of flow separation
away from a sharp corner, the direction of the forming vortex sheet is
ambiguous. To remove any ad-hoc implementation, the unsteady Kutta condition,
the conservation of circulation, as well as the conservation laws of mass and
momentum are coupled to analytically solve for the angle, strength, and
relative velocity of the trailing-edge vortex sheet. The two-dimensional
aerodynamic model together with the proposed vortex-sheet formation condition
is verified by comparing flow structures and force calculations with
experimental results for airfoils in steady and unsteady background flows.

control. In its military aspect, efficiently detecting evading targets by a
fleet of unmanned drones has an ever increasing impact on the ability of modern
armies to engage in warfare. The latter is true both traditional symmetric
conflicts among armies as well as asymmetric ones. Be it a speeding driver, a
polluting trailer or a covert convoy, the basic challenge remains the same --
how can its detection probability be maximized using as little number of drones
as possible.
  In this work we propose a novel approach for the optimization of large scale
swarms of reconnaissance drones -- capable of producing on-demand optimal
coverage strategies for any given search scenario. Given an estimation cost of
the threat's potential damages, as well as types of monitoring drones available
and their comparative performance, our proposed method generates an
analytically provable strategy, stating the optimal number and types of drones
to be deployed, in order to cost-efficiently monitor a pre-defined region for
targets maneuvering using a given roads networks.
  We demonstrate our model using a unique dataset of the Israeli transportation
network, on which different deployment schemes for drones deployment are
evaluated.

the action of spin-orbit coupling and a weak harmonically-varying linear force

or out-of-phase in two spinor components, respectively. The expectation value
for the position of the atom after one oscillation period of the linear force
is recovered in authentic resonances or in pseudo-resonances. The frequencies
of the linear force corresponding to authentic resonances are determined by the
band structure of the periodic potential and are affected by the spin-orbit
coupling. The width/dispersion of the wavepacket in authentic resonances is
usually minimal. The frequencies corresponding to pseudo-resonances do not
depend on the type of potential and on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling,
while the evolution of excitations at the corresponding frequencies is usually
accompanied by significant dispersion. Pseudo-resonances are determined by the
initial phase of the linear force and by the quasi-momentum of the wavepacket.
Due to the spinor nature of the system, the motion of the atom is accompanied
by periodic, but not harmonic, spin oscillations. Under the action of
spin-orbit coupling the oscillations of the wavepacket can be nearly completely
suppressed in optical lattices. Dynamic localization in Zeeman lattices is
characterized by doubling of the resonant oscillation periods due to band
crossing at the boundary of the Brillouin zone. We also show that higher
harmonics in the Fourier expansion of the energy band lead to effective
dispersion, which can be strong enough to prevent dynamic localization of the
Bloch wavepacket.

suitable for simulating high-frequency transient interaction between the

calculation of voltages at internal points in the regulating winding. The
approach is demonstrated for a single-phase three-winding transformer in tap
position Nom+ with inclusion of three internal points in the regulating winding
that represent the mid-point and the two extreme ends. The terminal equivalent
modeling makes use of additional common-mode measurements to avoid error
magnifications to result from the ungrounded tertiary winding. The final model
is used in a time domain simulation where ground-fault initiation results in a
resonant voltage build-up in the winding. It is shown that that the peak value
of the resonant overvoltage can be higher than during the lightning impulse
test, with unfavorable network conditions. Additional measurements show that
the selected tap position affects the terminal behavior of the transformer,
changing the frequency and peak value of the lower resonance point in the
voltage transfer between windings.

particle physics from little more than an algebra. Here, we argue that physical
concepts such as particles, causality, and irreversible time may result from
the algebra acting on itself. We then focus on a special case by considering
the algebra $\mathbb{R}\otimes\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}\otimes\mathbb{O}$.
Using nothing more than
$\mathbb{R}\otimes\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}\otimes\mathbb{O}$ acting on
itself, we set out to find standard model particle representations.
  From the complex quaternionic portion of the algebra, we find generalized
ideals, and show that they describe concisely all of the Lorentz
representations of the standard model. From the complex octonionic portion of
the algebra, we find minimal left ideals, and show that they mirror the
behaviour of a generation of quarks and leptons under $su(3)_c$ and
$u(1)_{em}$. We then demonstrate a rudimentary electroweak model which yields a
straightforward explanation as to why $SU(2)_L$ acts only on left-handed
states. This holds in the case of leptons.
  Finally, we demonstrate how $\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{O}$ can generate a
64-$\mathbb{C}$-dimensional algebra, wherein we find the $SU(3)_c$ irreducible
representations corresponding to three generations of quarks and leptons. We
then conclude by showing how to arrive at all 48 electric charges.

the nodes are time-varying. There is growing evidence that the complex network
that models the dynamics of the human brain has time-varying interconnections,
i.e., the network is evolving. Based on this evidence, we construct a patient
and data specific evolving network model (comprising discrete-time dynamical
systems) in which epileptic seizures or their terminations in the brain are
also determined by the nature of the time-varying interconnections between the
nodes. A novel and unique feature of our methodology is that the evolving
network model remembers the data from which it was conceived from, in the sense
that it evolves to almost regenerate the patient data even upon presenting an
arbitrary initial condition to it. We illustrate a potential utility of our
methodology by constructing an evolving network from clinical data that aids in
identifying an approximate seizure focus -- nodes in such a theoretically
determined seizure focus are outgoing hubs that apparently act as spreaders of
seizures. We also point out the efficacy of removal of such spreaders in
limiting seizures.

Near Horizon Extreme Magnetized Kerr geometry, the extreme limit of the

  for Fast Artistic Style Transfer","Accepted by CVPR 2017",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transferring artistic styles onto everyday photographs has become an
extremely popular task in both academia and industry. Recently, offline
training has replaced on-line iterative optimization, enabling nearly real-time
stylization. When those stylization networks are applied directly to
high-resolution images, however, the style of localized regions often appears
less similar to the desired artistic style. This is because the transfer
process fails to capture small, intricate textures and maintain correct texture
scales of the artworks. Here we propose a multimodal convolutional neural
network that takes into consideration faithful representations of both color
and luminance channels, and performs stylization hierarchically with multiple
losses of increasing scales. Compared to state-of-the-art networks, our network
can also perform style transfer in nearly real-time by conducting much more
sophisticated training offline. By properly handling style and texture cues at
multiple scales using several modalities, we can transfer not just large-scale,
obvious style cues but also subtle, exquisite ones. That is, our scheme can
generate results that are visually pleasing and more similar to multiple
desired artistic styles with color and texture cues at multiple scales.

browser and 52 of its add-ons. The study then re-casts the resulting
differential equations into non-linear, discrete-time, state space forms; and
estimate them using an MCMC approach to the Extended Kalman Filtern (EKF-MCMC).
Unlike continuous-time filters, the EKF-MCMC approach avoids numerical
integration, and so is more computational efficient, given the length of our
time-series, high dimension of our state space and need to model heterogeneity.
Results show, for example, that observational learning and add-on ratings
increase the demand for Firefox add-ons; add-ons can increase the market
potential of the Firefox platform; a slow add-on review process can diminish
platform success; and OSS platforms (i.e. Chrome and Firefox) compete rather
