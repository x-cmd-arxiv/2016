using bright low-energy positron beams. These novel analysis tools exploit the
unique properties of positron interaction with surfaces, which comprise the
absence of exchange interaction, repulsive crystal potential and positron
trapping in delocalized surface states at low energies. By applying reflection
high-energy positron diffraction (RHEPD) one can benefit from the phenomenon of
total reflection below a critical angle that is not present in electron surface
diffraction. Therefore, RHEPD allows the determination of the atom positions of
(reconstructed) surfaces with outstanding accuracy. The main advantages of
positron annihilation induced Auger-electron spectroscopy (PAES) are the
missing secondary electron background in the energy region of Auger-transitions
and its topmost layer sensitivity for elemental analysis. In order to enable
the investigation of the electron polarization at surfaces low-energy
spin-polarized positrons are used to probe the outermost electrons of the
surface. Furthermore, in fundamental research the preparation of well defined
surfaces tailored for the production of bound leptonic systems plays an
outstanding role. In this report, it is envisaged to cover both, the
fundamental aspects of positron surface interaction and the present status of
surface studies using modern positron beam techniques.

and heterogeneous catalogues. Hence, the need for efficient, reliable and
scalable catalogue cross-matching methods plays a crucial role in the era of
the petabyte scale. Furthermore, multi-band data have often very different
angular resolution, requiring the highest generality of cross-matching
features, mainly in terms of region shape and resolution. In this work we
present $C^{3}$ (Command-line Catalogue Cross-match), a multi-platform
application designed to efficiently cross-match massive catalogues. It is based
on a multi-core parallel processing paradigm and conceived to be executed as a
stand-alone command-line process or integrated within any generic data
reduction/analysis pipeline, providing the maximum flexibility to the end-user,
in terms of portability, parameter configuration, catalogue formats, angular
resolution, region shapes, coordinate units and cross-matching types. Using
real data, extracted from public surveys, we discuss the cross-matching
capabilities and computing time efficiency also through a direct comparison
with some publicly available tools, chosen among the most used within the
community, and representative of different interface paradigms. We verified
that the $C^{3}$ tool has excellent capabilities to perform an efficient and
reliable cross-matching between large datasets. Although the elliptical
cross-match and the parametric handling of angular orientation and offset are
known concepts in the astrophysical context, their availability in the
presented command-line tool makes $C^{3}$ competitive in the context of public
astronomical tools.

  For this, we developed in several iterations a meta quality model specifying
general concepts, a quality base model covering the most important quality
factors and a quality assessment approach. The meta model introduces the new
concept of a product factor, which bridges the gap between concrete
measurements and abstract quality aspects. Product factors have measures and
instruments to operationalise quality by measurements from manual inspection
and tool analysis. The base model uses the ISO 25010 quality attributes, which
we refine by 200 factors and 600 measures for Java and C# systems.
  We found in several empirical validations that the assessment results fit to
the expectations of experts for the corresponding systems. The empirical
analyses also showed that several of the correlations are statistically
significant and that the maintainability part of the base model has the highest
correlation, which fits to the fact that this part is the most comprehensive.
Although we still see room for extending and improving the base model, it shows
a high correspondence with expert opinions and hence is able to form the basis

depth of mu(B)=29.5 and mu(V)=28.5 mag/arcsec^2. At these depths, the limiting
systematic uncertainties are astrophysical: scattered starlight from foreground
Galactic dust, and variations in faint background sources. The dust-scattered
starlight is well-traced by deep far-infrared imaging, making it
distinguishable from true Virgo diffuse light. Our imaging maps the Virgo core
around M87 and the adjacent M86/M84 region, in subcluster B around M49, and in
the more distant W' cloud around NGC 4365. Most of the detected ICL is found in
the Virgo core and within the W' cloud, with little evidence for extensive ICL
in subcluster B. The large amount of diffuse light seen in the infalling W'
cloud likely illustrates the importance of the group environment for generating
ICL. The bulk of the detected ICL is fairly red (B-V=0.7-0.9), indicative of
old stellar populations. We estimate a total Virgo ICL fraction of 7-15%,
somewhat smaller than expected for massive, evolved clusters, suggesting that
Virgo is still growing its ICL component. We trace M87's extremely boxy halo
out to ~ 150 kpc, and show that the current stripping rate of low luminosity
galaxies is insufficient to have built M87's outer halo over a Hubble time.
Finally, we identify another large ultra-diffuse galaxy in Virgo, likely in the
process of being shredded by the cluster tidal field.

classification is parameterized by three indices, taking values in a group,
which is either trivial, the group of integers, or the group of integers modulo
2, depending on the type of symmetry. The classification is complete in the
sense that two walks have the same indices if and only if they can be connected
by a norm continuous path along which all the mentioned properties remain
valid. Of the three indices, two are related to the asymptotic behaviour far to
the right and far to the left, respectively. These are also stable under
compact perturbations. The third index is sensitive to those compact
perturbations which cannot be contracted to a trivial one. The results apply to
the Hamiltonian case as well. In this case all compact perturbations can be
contracted, so the third index is not defined. Our classification extends the
one known in the translation invariant case, where the asymptotic right and
left indices add up to zero, and the third one vanishes, leaving effectively
only one independent index. When two translationally invariant bulks with
distinct indices are joined, the left and right asymptotic indices of the
joined walk are thereby fixed, and there must be eigenvalues at $1$ or $-1$
(bulk-boundary correspondence). Their location is governed by the third index.

NLSP-to-LSP is small, only little energy is carried away by the invisible LSP.
This is also true even if several other SUSY particles are within the kinematic
reach, since these states would to a large extent decay via cascades ending
with an NLSP to LSP decay. A lepton collider does not have this problem. The
clean environment and known initial state at such machines assures that SUSY
can be detected even if the mass difference is very small, provided the
center-of-mass energy is sufficiently high. We present prospects for
observation and precision characterization of SUSY with small mass differences
at the ILC, based on detailed simulations of the ILD detector concept. The
resulting possibility to predict the dark matter relic density is evaluated and
compared to the precision obtained from the Planck mission. Taking a specific
model as an example, we also discuss the synergies from combining ILC and
HL-LHC results.

the motion of small bodies beyond Neptune. A special attention is given to
trajectories entirely exterior to the planetary orbits. The first one is the
well-known non-resonant model of Kozai (1962) adapted to the transneptunian
region. Contrary to previous papers, the dynamics is fully characterized with
respect to the fixed parameters. A maximum perihelion excursion possible of
16.4 AU is determined. The second model handles the occurrence of a mean-motion
resonance with one of the planets. In that case, the one-degree-of-freedom
integrable approximation is obtained by postulating the adiabatic invariance,
and is much more general and accurate than previous secular models found in the
literature. It brings out in a plain way the possibility of perihelion
oscillations with a very high amplitude. Such a model could thus be used in
future studies to deeper explore that kind of motion. For complex resonant
orbits (especially of type 1:k), a segmented secular description is necessary
since the trajectories are only ""integrable by parts"". The two models are
applied to the Solar System but the notations are kept general so that it could
be used for any quasi-circular and coplanar planetary system.

account effects of a five-dimensional bulk and intrinsic tension of the brane
embedded in the bulk, and constrain a key parameter of the extra dimension by
using the observational element abundances. Second, effects of the $\nu_{\rm
s}$ traveling on or off the brane are considered. In this model, the effective
mixing angle between a $\nu_{\rm s}$ and an active neutrino depends on energy,
which may give rise to a resonance effect on the mixing angle. Consequently,
reaction rate of the $\nu_{\rm s}$ can be drastically changed during the cosmic
evolution. We estimated abundances and temperature of the $\nu_{\rm s}$ by
solving the rate equation as a function of temperature until the sterile
neutrino decoupling. We then find that the relic abundance of the $\nu_{\rm s}$
is drastically enhanced by the extra-dimension and maximized for a
characteristic resonance energy $E_{\rm res}\gtrsim 0.01$ GeV. Finally, some
constraints related to the $\nu_{\rm s}$, mixing angle and mass difference, are
discussed in detail with the comparison of our BBN calculations corrected by
the extra-dimensional $\nu_{\rm s}$ to observational data on light element

transneptunian objects in mean-motion resonance with Neptune. The model applied
is thoroughly described in Saillenfest et al. (2016). The parameter space is
systematically explored, showing that the secular trajectories depend little on
the resonance order. High-amplitude oscillations of the perihelion distance are
reported and localised in the space of the orbital parameters. In particular,
we show that a large perihelion distance is not a sufficient criterion to
declare that an object is detached from the planets. Such a mechanism, though,
is found unable to explain the orbits of Sedna or 2012VP113, which are
insufficiently inclined (considering their high perihelion distance) to be
possibly driven by such a resonant dynamics. The secular representation
highlights the existence of a high-perihelion accumulation zone due to
resonances of type 1:k with Neptune. That region is found to be located roughly
at semi-major axes in [100;300] AU, perihelion distances in [50;70] AU and
inclinations [30;50]{\deg}. In addition to the flux of objects directly coming
from the Scattered Disc, numerical simulations show that the Oort Cloud is also

sensitivity to the remaining mass scale parameter can be recovered by measuring
the two-dimensional kinematical boundary in the relevant three-dimensional

this boundary, which uses the geometric properties of the Voronoi tessellation
of the data, and in particular, the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the
volumes of the neighbors for each Voronoi cell in the tessellation. We propose
a new observable, $\bar\Sigma$, which is the average RSD per unit area,

$\bar\Sigma$ maximum correlates very well with the true values of the new
particle masses. Our approach represents the natural extension of the

(EHR) notes through online patient portals has the potential to improve
patient-centered care. However, medical jargon, which abounds in EHR notes, has
been shown to be a barrier for patient EHR comprehension. Existing knowledge
bases that link medical jargon to lay terms or definitions play an important
role in alleviating this problem but have low coverage of medical jargon in
EHRs. We developed a data-driven approach that mines EHRs to identify and rank
medical jargon based on its importance to patients, to support the building of
EHR-centric lay language resources.
  Methods: We developed an innovative adapted distant supervision (ADS) model
based on support vector machines to rank medical jargon from EHRs. For distant
supervision, we utilized the open-access, collaborative consumer health
vocabulary, a large, publicly available resource that links lay terms to
medical jargon. We explored both knowledge-based features from the Unified
Medical Language System and distributed word representations learned from
unlabeled large corpora. We evaluated the ADS model using physician-identified
important medical terms.
  Results: Our ADS model significantly surpassed two state-of-the-art automatic
term recognition methods, TF*IDF and C-Value, yielding 0.810 ROC-AUC versus
0.710 and 0.667, respectively. Our model identified 10K important medical
jargon terms after ranking over 100K candidate terms mined from over 7,500 EHR
narratives.
  Conclusion: Our work is an important step towards enriching lexical resources

comprehension. The identified medical jargon terms and their rankings are

simple linear detection techniques, designed to avoid the need of complex

by combining the use of such simple linear detectors with an appropriate
interference cancellation procedure - within an iterative DF technique -, a
close approximation to the SIMO MFB performance can be achieved after a few
iterations, even for 64-QAM schemes, when the number of BS antennas is, at

supervised resources (i.e., no parallel corpora) using multimodal embedded
representation over texts and images. Based on the assumption that text
documents are often likely to be described with other multimedia information
(e.g., images) somewhat related to the content, we try to indirectly estimate
the relevance between two languages. Using multimedia as the ""pivot"", we
project all modalities into one common hidden space where samples belonging to
similar semantic concepts should come close to each other, whatever the
observed space of each sample is. This modality-agnostic representation is the
key to bridging the gap between different modalities. Putting a decoder on top
of it, our network can flexibly draw the outputs from any input modality.
Notably, in the testing phase, we need only source language texts as the input
for translation. In experiments, we tested our method on two benchmarks to show
that it can achieve reasonable translation performance. We compared and
investigated several possible implementations and found that an end-to-end
model that simultaneously optimized both rank loss in multimodal encoders and
cross-entropy loss in decoders performed the best.

online community identification based on a dynamic community detection

with the ""dominant"" neighbour community. Additionally, (ii) a community

sampling method applicable to discrete undirected graphical models. While
similar to simulated annealing, QA relies on quantum, rather than thermal,
effects to explore complex search spaces. For many classes of problems, QA is
known to offer computational advantages over simulated annealing. Here we
report on the ability of recent QA hardware to accelerate training of fully
visible Boltzmann machines. We characterize the sampling distribution of QA
hardware, and show that in many cases, the quantum distributions differ
significantly from classical Boltzmann distributions. In spite of this
difference, training (which seeks to match data and model statistics) using
standard classical gradient updates is still effective. We investigate the use
of QA for seeding Markov chains as an alternative to contrastive divergence
(CD) and persistent contrastive divergence (PCD). Using $k=50$ Gibbs steps, we
show that for problems with high-energy barriers between modes, QA-based seeds
can improve upon chains with CD and PCD initializations. For these hard
problems, QA gradient estimates are more accurate, and allow for faster
learning. Furthermore, and interestingly, even the case of raw QA samples (that
is, $k=0$) achieved similar improvements. We argue that this relates to the
fact that we are training a quantum rather than classical Boltzmann
distribution in this case. The learned parameters give rise to hardware QA
distributions closely approximating classical Boltzmann distributions that are
hard to train with CD/PCD.

in novae and other astrophysical sources carries a wealth of information about
the outflow properties and the microphysical processes at work near the shocks.
The observation of GeV gamma-rays from novae by Fermi/LAT demonstrates that the
shocks in these systems can accelerate particles to energies of at least $\sim
10$ GeV. The low-energy extension of the same non-thermal particle distribution
inevitably gives rise to emission extending into the X-ray band. Above $\gtrsim
10$ keV this radiation can escape the system without significant
absorption/attenuation, and can potentially be detected by NuSTAR. We present
theoretical models for hard X-ray and gamma-ray emission from radiative shocks
in both leptonic and hadronic scenarios, accounting for the rapid evolution of
the downstream properties due to the fast cooling of thermal plasma. Due to
strong Coulomb cooling of the mildly relativistic electrons nominally
responsible for producing hard X-ray emission, only a fraction of $10^{-4} -
10^{-3}$ of the gamma-ray luminosity is radiated in the NuSTAR band;
nevertheless, this emission could be detectable simultaneous with the LAT
emission in bright gamma-ray novae with a $\sim 50$ ks exposure. Our work
demonstrates how combined hard X-ray and gamma-ray observations can be used to
constrain properties of the nova outflow (velocity, density and mass outflow
rate) and particle acceleration at the shock. A very low X-ray to gamma-ray
luminosity ratio ($L_{\rm X}/L_{\gamma} \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4}$) would
disfavor leptonic models for the gamma-ray emission. Our model can also be
applied to other astrophysical environments with radiative shocks, including
Type IIn supernovae and colliding winds in massive star binaries.

often used to compare algorithms. This may be misleading if worst-case
instances occur infrequently, and thus there is a demand for optimization
methods which return the algorithm configuration best suited for the given
application's typical inputs. We address this problem for clustering, max-cut,
and other partitioning problems, such as integer quadratic programming, by
designing computationally efficient and sample efficient learning algorithms
which receive samples from an application-specific distribution over problem

Our algorithms learn over common integer quadratic programming and clustering
algorithm families: SDP rounding algorithms and agglomerative clustering
algorithms with dynamic programming. For our sample complexity analysis, we
provide tight bounds on the pseudodimension of these algorithm classes, and
show that surprisingly, even for classes of algorithms parameterized by a
single parameter, the pseudo-dimension is superconstant. In this way, our work
both contributes to the foundations of algorithm configuration and pushes the

computer science, mathematics and physics can be reduced to one of the
following computational tasks involving polynomials and set systems: given an
$m$-variate real polynomial $g$ and a family of subsets $B$ of $[m]$, (1) find
$S\in B$ such that the monomial in $g$ corresponding to $S$ has the largest
coefficient in $g$, or (2) compute the sum of coefficients of monomials in $g$
corresponding to all the sets in $B$. Special cases of these problems, such as
computing permanents, sampling from DPPs and maximizing subdeterminants have
been topics of recent interest in theoretical computer science.
  In this paper we present a general convex programming framework geared to
solve both of these problems. We show that roughly, when $g$ is a real stable
polynomial with non-negative coefficients and $B$ is a matroid, the integrality
gap of our relaxation is finite and depends only on $m$ (and not on the
coefficients of g).
  Prior to our work, such results were known only in sporadic cases that relied
on the structure of $g$ and $B$; it was not even clear if one could formulate a
convex relaxation that has a finite integrality gap beyond these special cases.
Two notable examples are a result by Gurvits on the van der Waerden conjecture
for real stable $g$ when $B$ is a single element and a result by Nikolov and
Singh for multilinear real stable polynomials when $B$ is a partition matroid.
Our work, which encapsulates most interesting cases of $g$ and $B$, benefits
from both - we were inspired by the latter in deriving the right convex
programming relaxation and the former in establishing the integrality gap.
However, proving our results requires significant extensions of both; in that
process we come up with new notions and connections between stable polynomials
and matroids which should be of independent interest.

nonlinear multi-oscillator systems like power systems are hard to analyze. For
such a system, we propose a nonlinear modal decoupling (NMD) approach inversely
constructing as many decoupled nonlinear oscillators as the system oscillation
modes so that individual decoupled oscillators can easily be analyzed to infer
dynamics and stability of the original system. The NMD follows a similar idea
to the normal form except that we eliminate inter-modal terms but allow
intra-modal terms of desired nonlinearities in decoupled systems, so decoupled
systems can flexibly be shaped into desired forms of nonlinear oscillators. The
NMD is then applied to power systems towards two types of nonlinear
oscillators, i.e. the single-machine-infinite-bus (SMIB) systems and a proposed
non-SMIB oscillator. Numerical studies on a 3-machine 9-bus system and New
England 10-machine 39-bus system show that (i) decoupled oscillators keep a
majority of the original system modal nonlinearities and the NMD provides a
bigger validity region than the normal form, and (ii) decoupled non-SMIB
oscillators may keep more authentic dynamics of the original system than
decoupled SMIB systems.

constructed by combining the Green's function approach with the coupled-cluster

axis we employ a Berggren basis in the complex energy plane combined with the
Lanczos method. Using this approach, we perform a proof-of-principle
calculation of the optical potential for the elastic neutron scattering on
$^{16}{\rm O}$. For the computation of the ground-state of $^{16}{\rm O}$, we
use the coupled-cluster method in the singles-and-doubles approximation, while
for the $A=\pm 1$ nuclei we use particle-attached/removed equation-of-motion
method truncated at two-particle-one-hole and one-particle-two-hole
excitations, respectively. We verify the convergence of the optical potential
and scattering phase shifts with respect to the model-space size and the number
of discretized complex continuum states. We also investigate the absorptive
component of the optical potential (which reflects the opening of inelastic
channels) by computing its imaginary volume integral and find an almost
negligible absorptive component at low-energies. To shed light on this result,
we computed excited states of $^{16}{\rm O}$ using equation-of-motion
coupled-cluster method with singles-and-doubles excitations and we found no
low-lying excited states below 10~MeV. Furthermore, most excited states have a
dominant two-particle-two-hole component, making higher-order particle-hole
excitations necessary to achieve a precise description of these core-excited

attributed to the lack of correlations coming from the low-order cluster
truncation in the employed coupled-cluster method.

of the current state-of-the-art colloidal science. Nematic liquid crystals with

well-controlled placement of colloidal particles thanks to the elastic forces
between the particles and the surrounding landscape of molecular orientation.
Here we demonstrate how the spatially varying director field can be used to
control placement of non-spherical particles of boomerang shape. The boomerang
colloids create director distortions of a dipolar symmetry. When a boomerang
particle is placed in a periodic splay-bend director pattern, it migrates
towards the region of a maximum bend. The behavior is contrasted to that one of
spherical particles with normal surface anchoring, which also produce dipolar
director distortions, but prefer to compartmentalize into the regions with a
maximum splay. The splay-bend periodic landscape thus allows one to spatially
separate these two types of particles. By exploring overdamped dynamics of the
colloids, we determine elastic driving forces responsible for the preferential
placement. Control of colloidal locations through patterned molecular
orientation can be explored for future applications in microfluidic, lab on a
chip, sensing and sorting devices.

translation quality of language pairs that the model was trained with, our
models can also learn to perform implicit bridging between language pairs never
seen explicitly during training, showing that transfer learning and zero-shot
translation is possible for neural translation. Finally, we show analyses that

non-equilibrium effects in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) capsule
implosions. These cannot be fully captured by hydrodynamic simulations while
kinetic methods, as the one presented in this study, are able to describe
continuum and rarefied regimes within one approach. In the past, our code has
been verified via traditional shock wave and fluid instability simulations. In
the present work, we focus on setups that are closer to applications in ICF. We
perform simple 2D disk implosion simulations using one particle species. The
obtained results are compared to simulations using the hydrodynamics code RAGE.
In a first study, the implosions are powered by energy deposition in the outer
layers of the disk. We test the impact of the particle mean-free-path and find
that while the width of the implosion shock broadens, its location as a
function of time remains very similar. In a second study, we focus on the
formation of fluid instabilities from induced perturbations. We find good
agreement with hydrodynamic studies regarding the location of the shock, the
implosion dynamics and the formation of imposed fluid instabilities.
Differences are due to the higher resolution of RAGE and statistical noise in
the kinetic simulations. The current studies represent proofs-of-principle and
serve as a stepping stone for more sophisticated ICF simulations in the future.

antiquark, which are in relative motion with respect to a hot and dense medium.
The heavy quark-antiquark complex potential is obtained by correcting both the
Coulombic and the linear terms in the Cornell potential through a dielectric
function estimated within the real-time formalism using the hard thermal loop
approximation. We show the variation of both the real and the imaginary parts
of the potential for different values of velocities when the bound state ($
Q\bar{Q}$ pair) is aligned in the direction parallel as well as perpendicular
to the relative velocity of the $ Q\bar{Q}$ pair with the thermal medium. With
an increase of the relative velocity the screening of the real part of the
potential becomes weaker at short distances and stronger at large distances for
the parallel case. However, for the perpendicular case the potential decreases
with an increase of the velocity at all distances which results in the larger
screening of the potential. In addition, the inclusion of the string term makes
the screening of the potential weaker as compared to the Coulombic term alone
for both cases. Therefore, by combining all these effects we expect a stronger
binding of a $ Q\bar{Q} $ pair in a moving medium in the presence of the string
term as compared to the Coulombic term alone. The imaginary part decreases (in
magnitude) with an increase of the relative velocity, leading to a decrease of
the width of the quarkonium state at higher velocities. The inclusion of the
string term increases the magnitude of the imaginary part, which results in an
increase of the width of the quarkonium states. All of these effects lead to
the modification in the dissolution of quarkonium states.

invariance of the bounce was provided later by Coleman, Glaser, and Martin
(CGM), who extended the proof to $N>2$ Euclidean dimensions but, again,
restricted non-trivially to a single scalar field. As far as we know a proof of

Following CGM we define the reduced problem of finding a field configuration
minimizing the kinetic energy at fixed potential energy. Given a solution of
the reduced problem, the minimum action bounce can always be obtained from it
by means of a scale transformation. We show that if a solution of the reduced

workflow bottleneck in a number of important applications of deep learning,

network must be scaled beyond a single machine to as many machines as possible
by distributing the optimization method used for training. While a number of
approaches have been proposed for distributed stochastic gradient descent
(SGD), at the current time synchronous approaches to distributed SGD appear to
be showing the greatest performance at large scale. Synchronous scaling of SGD
suffers from the need to synchronize all processors on each gradient step and
is not resilient in the face of failing or lagging processors. In asynchronous
approaches using parameter servers, training is slowed by contention to the
parameter server. In this paper we compare the convergence of synchronous and
asynchronous SGD for training a modern ResNet network architecture on the
ImageNet classification problem. We also propose an asynchronous method,
gossiping SGD, that aims to retain the positive features of both systems by
replacing the all-reduce collective operation of synchronous training with a
gossip aggregation algorithm. We find, perhaps counterintuitively, that
asynchronous SGD, including both elastic averaging and gossiping, converges
faster at fewer nodes (up to about 32 nodes), whereas synchronous SGD scales
better to more nodes (up to about 100 nodes).

observations, measurements of the star formation rate, and an assumed molecular
gas depletion time ($t_{\rm dep}$=$M_{\rm gas}$/SFR) --- the latter two of
which establish the total molecular gas mass independent of the observed CO
luminosity. For a broad range of adopted depletion times, we find that
$\alpha_{\rm CO}$ is independent of total mass surface density, with little
deviation from the canonical Milky Way value. This runs contrary to a scenario
in which $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ decreases as surface density increases within the
extended clouds of molecular gas that potentially fuel clumps of star formation
in $z\sim1$ galaxies, similar to those observed in local ULIRGs. Instead, our
results suggest that molecular gas, both at $z\sim0$ and $z\sim1$, is primarily
in the form of self-gravitating molecular clouds. While CO observations suggest
a factor of $\sim3$ reduction in the average molecular gas depletion time
between $z \sim 0$ and $z\sim1$, we find that, for typical galaxies, the
structure of molecular gas and the process of star formation at $z \sim 1$ is
otherwise remarkably similar to that observed in local star-forming systems.

sufficient entropy within experimentally accessible timescales? Finite

expose coherent low temperature physics. The protocol is particularly natural

bound on the crossover time, which suggests that the decay is followed by a
parametrically long period of late time growth. Finally, we discuss integrable

restored by an infinite sum over non-perturbative saddles.

Recently, it has been proposed that such a three-dimensional gapless state is
unstable to a Mott-insulating ground state at low temperatures when the number
of band touching points $N$ at the Fermi level is smaller than a certain
critical number $N_c$. We further substantiate and quantify this scenario by
various approaches. Using $\epsilon$ expansion near two spatial dimensions, we
show that $N_c = 64/(25 \epsilon^2) + O(1/\epsilon)$ and demonstrate that the
instability for $N < N_c$ is towards a nematic ground state that can be
understood as if the system were under (dynamically generated) uniaxial strain.
We also propose a truncation of the functional renormalization group equations
in the dynamical bosonization scheme which we show to agree to one-loop order
with the results from $\epsilon$ expansion both near two as well as near four
dimensions, and which smoothly interpolates between these two perturbatively
accessible limits for general $2<d<4$. Directly in $d=3$ we therewith find $N_c

consistent with the prediction that the interacting ground state of pure,

compared with clusters moving close to the Galactic plane. This is because at
high altitudes, open clusters are far from the disruptive effects of in-plane
substructures, such as spiral arms, molecular clouds and the bar. However, an
important aspect to consider in this scenario is that orbits of high-altitude
open clusters will eventually cross the Galactic plane, where the vertical
tidal field of the disk is strong. In this work we simulate the interaction of
open clusters with the tidal field of a detailed Milky Way Galactic model at
different average altitudes and galactocentric radii. We find that the life
expectancy of clusters decreases as the maximum orbital altitude increases and
reaches a minimum at altitudes of approximately 600 pc. Clusters near the
Galactic plane live longer because they do not experience strong vertical tidal
shocks from the Galactic disk; then, for orbital altitudes higher than 600 pc,
clusters start again to live longer due to the decrease in the number of
encounters with the disk. With our study, we find that the compressive nature
of the tides in the arms region and the bar have an important role on the
survival of small clusters by protecting them from disruption: clusters inside
the arms can live up to twice as long as those outside the arms at similar
galactocentric distance.

the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) has
initiated a new field of astronomy by providing an alternate means of sensing
the universe. The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is
achieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from
non-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to
a variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate
the data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are
transient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so
that accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.
In this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing
with machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the
glitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we
engage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches
into pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that
appear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are
used to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of
the morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification
methods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency
and accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and
characterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and
subsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby
improving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We
demonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO's first
observing run.

observed trend of star formation histories extending over shorter time-scales
for more massive galaxies, but does not provide a sufficient condition to
reproduce the observed $\alpha$ enhancements of massive galaxies. In the
framework of our model, this is possible only assuming that any residual star
formation is truncated for galaxies more massive than $10^{10.5}\,{\rm

for the most massive galaxies, that translate in total stellar metallicities
significantly lower than observed. Our results demonstrate that (i) trends of
[$\alpha$/Fe] ratios cannot be simply converted in relative time-scale
indicators, and (ii) AGN feedback cannot explain alone the positive correlation
between [$\alpha$/Fe] and galaxy mass/velocity dispersion. Reproducing
simultaneously the mass-metallicity relation and the $\alpha$ enhancements

containing a small fraction (few per cent) of the total internal energy (e.g. a

nucleus paradigm and solely working with the electronic wavefunctions, so does
not include nuclear vibrations in the AIM analysis. On the other hand, the
recently extended version of the QTAIM, called the multi-component QTAIM
(MC-QTAIM), incorporates both electrons and quantum nuclei, i.e. those nuclei
treated as quantum waves instead of clamped point charges, into the AIM
analysis using non-adiabatic wavefunctions. Thus, the MC-QTAIM is the natural
framework to incorporate the role of nuclear vibrations into the AIM analysis.
In this study, within the context of the MC-QTAIM, the formalism of including
nuclear vibrational energy in the atomic basin energy is developed in detail
and its contribution is derived analytically using the recently proposed
non-adiabatic Hartree product nuclear wavefunction. It is demonstrated that
within the context of this wavefunction the quantum nuclei may be conceived
pseudo-adiabatically as quantum oscillators and both isotropic harmonic and
anisotropic anharmonic oscillator models are used to compute the zero-point
nuclear vibrational energy contribution to the basin energies explicitly.
Inspired by the results gained within the context of the MC-QTAIM analysis, a
heuristic approach is proposed within the context of the QTAIM to include
nuclear vibrational energy in the basin energy from the vibrational
wavefunction derived adiabatically. The explicit calculation of the basin
contribution of the zero-point vibrational energy using uncoupled harmonic
oscillator model leads to results consistent with those derived from the
MC-QTAIM.

in star-forming (SF) galaxies at z ~ 0, using the AKARI Far-Infrared Surveyor
(FIS) all-sky map and the large spectroscopic galaxy sample from Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7). We restrict the sample to those within
the redshift range of 0.05 < z < 0.07 and the stellar mass range of 9.2 <
log_10 (M_star/M_solar). We select SF galaxies based on their H_alpha
equivalent width (EW_Ha> 4 A) and emission line flux ratios. We perform
far-infrared (FIR) stacking analyses by splitting the SDSS SF galaxy sample
according to their stellar mass, specific SFR (SSFR_SDSS), and environment. We
derive total infrared luminosity (LIR) for each subsample using the average
flux densities at WIDE-S (90 micron) and WIDE-L (140 micron) bands, and then
compute IR-based SFR (SFR_IR) from L_IR. We find a mild decrease of IR- based
SSFR (SSFR_IR) amongst SF galaxies with increasing local density (~0.1-dex
level at maximum), which suggests that environmental effects do not instantly
shut down the SF activity in galaxies. We also derive average dust temperature
(T_dust) using the flux densities at 90 micron and 140 micron bands. We confirm
a strong positive correlation between T_dust and SSFR_IR, consistent with
recent studies. The most important finding of this study is that we find a
marginal trend that T_dust increases with increasing environmental galaxy
density. Although the environmental trend is much milder than the SSFR-T_dust
correlation, our results suggest that the environmental density may affect the
dust temperature in SF galaxies, and that the physical mechanism which is
responsible for this phenomenon is not necessarily specific to cluster
environments because the environmental dependence of T_dust holds down to
relatively low-density environments.

determines the observability of grains, and sets the conditions for grain
growth and eventually planet formation. In this work we explore the effect of
photophoresis on the settling of large dust grains in the inner regions of
actively accreting protoplanetary disks. Photophoretic forces on dust grains
result from the collision of gas molecules with differentially heated grains.
We undertake one dimensional dust settling calculations to determine the
equilibrium vertical distribution of dust grains in each column of the disk. In
the process we introduce a new treatment of the photophoresis force which is
consistent at all optical depths with the representation of the radiative
intensity field in a two-stream radiative transfer approximation. The
levitation of large dust grains creates a photophoretic dust trap several scale
heights above the mid-plane in the inner regions of the disk where the
dissipation of accretion energy is significant. We find that differential
settling of dust grains is radically altered in these regions of the disk, with
large dust grains trapped in a layer below the stellar irradiation surface in
where the dust to gas mass ratio can be enhanced by a factor of a hundred for
the relevant particles. The photophoretic trapping effect has a strong
dependence on particle size and porosity.

of RR Lyrae are observable as far as ~20 degrees, in agreement with the most
recent map of Mira-like stars reported in Deason et al (2016). The SMC's outer
stellar density contours show a characteristic S-shape, symptomatic of the
on-set of tidal stripping. Beyond several degrees from the center of the dwarf,
the Gaia RR Lyrae stars trace the Cloud's trailing arm, extending towards the
LMC. This stellar tidal tail mapped with RR Lyrae is not aligned with the
gaseous Magellanic Bridge, and is shifted by some ~5 degrees from the Young
Main Sequence bridge. We use the offset between the bridges to put constraints
on the density of the hot gaseous corona of the Milky Way.

deg x 20 deg, corresponding to ~115 x 90 $h_{70}$ Mpc at the supercluster
redshift. In redshift space, the overdensity appears to consist of two merging
wall-like structures, interspersed with clusters and groups. Both the velocity
histogram and the morphology of the multi-branching wall structure are
consistent with a supercluster classification. $K_s^o$ galaxy counts show an
enhancement of ~1.2 over the survey area for galaxies brighter than $M_K^*$ at

leading order in the Lorentz-violating coefficients, the relevant Green's

point-splitting technique allow us to express the vacuum expectation value of
the stress-energy tensor in terms of the Green's function. We discuss its
structure in the region between the plates. We compute the renormalized vacuum
stress, which is obtained as the difference between the vacuum stress in the
presence of the plates and that of the vacuum. The Casimir force is evaluated
in an analytical fashion by two methods: by differentiating the renormalized
global energy density and by computing the normal-normal component of the
renormalized vacuum stress. We compute the local Casimir energy, which is found
to diverge as approaching the plates, and we demonstrate that it does not

polarization is higher at minimum light (13--18%) than that at pre-maximum

continuum results in a limb-darkened disk diameter of 49.1+/-1.5 mas and a
limb-darkening parameter of 1.16+/-0.49, indicating that the atmosphere is more
extended with weaker limb-darkening compared to pre-maximum light. Our Monte
Carlo radiative transfer modeling suggests the predominance of small (0.1
micron) grains of Al2O3, Mg2SiO4, and MgSiO3 at minimum light, in marked
contrast to the predominance of large (0.5 micron) grains at pre-maximum light.
The variability phase dependence of the grain size implies that small grains

timescales, from months down to minutes. It is therefore essential to observe
blazars simultaneously at different wavelengths, especially in the X-ray and
gamma-ray bands, where the broadband spectral energy distributions usually
peak.
  In this work, we report on three ""target-of-opportunity"" (ToO) observations
of Mrk 421, one of the brightest TeV blazars, triggered by a strong flaring
event at TeV energies in 2014. These observations feature long, continuous, and
simultaneous exposures with XMM-Newton (covering X-ray and optical/ultraviolet
bands) and VERITAS (covering TeV gamma-ray band), along with contemporaneous
observations from other gamma-ray facilities (MAGIC and Fermi-LAT) and a number
of radio and optical facilities. Although neither rapid flares nor significant
X-ray/TeV correlation are detected, these observations reveal subtle changes in
the X-ray spectrum of the source over the course of a few days. We search the
simultaneous X-ray and TeV data for spectral hysteresis patterns and time
delays, which could provide insight into the emission mechanisms and the source
properties (e.g. the radius of the emitting region, the strength of the
magnetic field, and related timescales). The observed broadband spectra are
consistent with a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. We find that the
power spectral density distribution at $\gtrsim 4\times 10^{-4}$ Hz from the
X-ray data can be described by a power-law model with an index value between
1.2 and 1.8, and do not find evidence for a steepening of the power spectral
index (often associated with a characteristic length scale) compared to the
previously reported values at lower frequencies.

provide a review of experimental studies on thermoelectric properties of single
QDs realized in two-dimensional electron gases, single-walled carbon nanotubes
and semiconductor nanowires. A key requirement for such experiments is methods
for nanoscale thermal biasing. We briefly review the main techniques used in
the field, namely, heating of the QD contacts, side heating and top heating,
and touch upon their relative advantages. The thermoelectric response of a QD
as a function of gate potential has a characteristic oscillatory behavior with
the same period as is observed for conductance peaks. Much of the existing
literature focuses on the agreement between experiments and theory,
particularly for amplitude and line-shape of the thermovoltage $V_{th}$. A
general observation is that the widely used single-electron tunneling
approximation for QDs has limited success in reproducing measured $V_{th}$.
Landauer-type calculations are often found to describe measurement results
better despite the large electron-electron interactions in QDs. More recently,
nonlinear thermoelectric effects have moved into the focus of attention and we
offer a brief overview of experiments done so far. We conclude by discussing
open questions and avenues for future work, including the role of asymmetries
in tunnel- and capacitive couplings in thermoelectric behavior of QDs.

past decade in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems.
Several transmission technologies and precoding techniques have been developed
in order to exploit the spatial dimension so that simultaneous transmission of
independent data streams reuse the same radio resources. The achievable
performance of such techniques heavily depends on the channel characteristics
of the selected users, the amount of channel knowledge, and how efficiently
interference is mitigated. In systems where the total number of receivers is
larger than the number of total transmit antennas, user selection becomes a key
approach to benefit from multiuser diversity and achieve full multiplexing
gain. The overall performance of MU-MIMO systems is a complex joint
multi-objective optimization problem since many variables and parameters have
to be optimized, including the number of users, the number of antennas, spatial
signaling, rate and power allocation, and transmission technique. The objective
of this literature survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of the various
methodologies used to approach the aforementioned joint optimization task in
the downlink of MU-MIMO communication systems.

cluster NGC 1856 has caught significant attention. The observations can be
explained by invoking two stellar generations with different ages and
metallicities or by a single generation of stars composed of two populations
characterized by different rotation rates. We analyzed the number ratios of
stars belonging to both main-sequence components in NGC 1856 as a function of
radius. We found that their number ratios remain approximately unchanged from
the cluster's central region to its periphery, indicating that both components
are homogeneously distributed in space. Through a comparison of the loci of the
best-fitting isochrones with the ridge lines of both stellar components, we
found that both multiple stellar populations and rapid stellar rotation can
potentially explain the observed main-sequence bifurcation in NGC 1856.
However, if NGC1856 were a young representative of the old globular clusters,
then the multiple stellar populations model would not be able to explain the
observed homogeneity in the spatial distributions of these two components,
since all relevant scenarios would predict that the second stellar generation
should be formed in a more compact configuration than that of the first stellar
generation, while NGC 1856 is too young for both stellar generations to have
been fully mixed dynamically. We speculate that the rapid stellar rotation
scenario would be the favored explanation of the observed multiple stellar
sequences in NGC 1856.

simultaneously, necessitating the comprehensive treatment of these conditions.
Finding the optimal set of drugs for a combinatorial set of diseases is a
combinatorial pattern exploration problem. Association rule mining is a popular
tool for such problems, but the requirement of health care for finding causal,
rather than associative, patterns renders association rule mining unsuitable.
To address this issue, we propose a novel framework based on the Rubin-Neyman
causal model for extracting causal rules from observational data, correcting
for a number of common biases. Specifically, given a set of interventions and a
set of items that define subpopulations (e.g., diseases), we wish to find all
subpopulations in which effective intervention combinations exist and in each
such subpopulation, we wish to find all intervention combinations such that
dropping any intervention from this combination will reduce the efficacy of the
treatment. A key aspect of our framework is the concept of closed intervention
sets which extend the concept of quantifying the effect of a single
intervention to a set of concurrent interventions. We also evaluated our causal
rule mining framework on the Electronic Health Records (EHR) data of a large
cohort of patients from Mayo Clinic and showed that the patterns we extracted
are sufficiently rich to explain the controversial findings in the medical
literature regarding the effect of a class of cholesterol drugs on Type-II

\{0\}$, and every $\varepsilon > 0$, we prove that there are a computable
function $M = M(d,\varepsilon,\deg{P},h(P)) < \infty$ and a finite union $Z =
Z(d,\varepsilon,\deg{P},h(P))$ of proper torsion cosets $\boldsymbol{\mu} T

contains all but at most $M$ of the torsion points $\boldsymbol{\zeta} \in
\mu_N^d$ satisfying $|P(\boldsymbol{\zeta})| < e^{-\varepsilon \phi(N)}$. This
extends a well known structural theorem from torsion points lying exactly on a
variety to torsion points lying very near to the subvariety. As a consequence,
we prove that the averages of $\log{|P(\mathbf{x})|}$ over $\mu_N^d$ converge
as $N \to \infty$ to the Mahler measure of $P$.
  By the work of B. Kitchens, D. Lind, K. Schmidt and T. Ward, the convergence
consequence amounts to the following statement in dynamics: For every
Noetherian $\mathbb{Z}^d$-action $T : \mathbb{Z}^d \to \mathrm{Aut}(X)$ by
automorphisms of a compact abelian group $X$ having a finite topological
entropy $h(T)$, the exponential growth rate of the number of connected
components of the group $\mathrm{Per}_N(T)$ of $N \cdot \mathbb{Z}^d$-periodic
points of $(X,T)$ exists as $N \to \infty$, and equals the topological entropy
$h(T)$. Moreover, it follows that all weak-$*$ limit measures of the
push-forwards of the Haar measures on $\mathrm{Per}_N(T)$, under any a sequence
of positive integers $N$, are measures of maximum entropy $h(T)$.
  Our main arithmetic result extends to Diophantine approximation by points of
sufficiently small canonical height. It is best possible in such a generality,
where an exceptional set is an inevitable feature.

proposed for a wide variety of applications. Despite this, learning from
implicit feedback is still computationally challenging. So far, most work
relies on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) solvers which are easy to derive,

the simple matrix factorization model, an efficient coordinate descent (CD)

been derived for more complex models.
  In this paper, we provide a new framework for deriving efficient CD

the arch then writhed moderately in a left-handed sense, while the originally
dark prominence material became in emission in the Fe IX 171~{\AA} passband,
and a braided structure appeared at the eastern edge of the warped arch. The
unraveling of the braided structure was associated with a transient brightening
in EUV and apparently contributed to the formation of a curtain-like structure
(CLS). The CLS consisted of myriads of thread-like loops rotating
counterclockwise about the vertical if viewed from above. Heated prominence
material was observed to slide along these loops and land outside the filament
channel. The tornado was eventually disintegrated and the remaining material
flew along a left-handed helical path of approximately a full turn, as
corroborated through stereoscopic reconstruction, into the cavity of the
stable, western section of the prominence. We suggest that the tornado-like
evolution of the prominence was governed by the helical kink instability, and
that the CLS formed through magnetic reconnections between the prominence field
and the overlying coronal field.

subjects who carry a parasite load but do not show clinical symptoms. A correct
understanding of the influence of asymptomatic individuals on transmission
dynamics will provide a comprehensive description of the complex interplay
between the definitive host (female \textit{Anopheles} mosquito), intermediate
host (human) and agent (\textit{Plasmodium} parasite). The goal of this article
is to conduct a rigorous mathematical analysis of a new compartmentalized
malaria model accounting for asymptomatic human hosts for the purpose of
calculating the basic reproductive number ($\mathcal{R}_0$), and determining
the bifurcations that might occur at the onset of disease free equilibrium. A
point of departure of this model from others appearing in literature is that
the asymptomatic compartment is decomposed into two mutually disjoint
sub-compartments by making use of the naturally acquired immunity (NAI) of the
population under consideration. After deriving the model, a qualitative
analysis is carried out to classify the stability of the equilibria of the
system. Our results show that the dynamical system is locally asymptotically
stable provided that $\mathcal{R}_0<1$. However this stability is not global,
owning to the occurrence of a sub-critical bifurcation in which additional
non-trivial sub-threshold equilibrium solutions appear in response to a
specified parameter being perturbed. To ensure that the model does not undergo
a backward bifurcation, we demand that an auxiliary parameter denoted
$\Lambda<1$ in addition to the threshold constraint $\mathcal{R}_0<1$. The
authors hope that this qualitative analysis will fill in the gaps of what is
currently known about asymptomatic malaria and aid in designing strategies that
assist the further development of malaria control and eradication efforts.

population synthesis models. The RS scatter predicted by the models at $z< 0.7$
is found to not depend on the star formation history adopted, whilst at $z>the
correlation found between age and rest-frame colour scatters is quite robust,
although all age scatter estimations ultimately depend on the definition of RS

RS galaxies predicted by both hydrodynamical simulations and SAM increases with
cosmic epoch, while the ratio between the age spread and the average age

solitary waves (or lumps) in a V-shaped pattern downstream of the source. In
the reference frame of the laboratory, these unsteady lumps propagate in a
direction oblique to the motion of the source. In the present experiments, the
strengths of the two sources are adjusted to produce nearly identical responses
and the free-surface deformations are visualized using photography-based
techniques. The first lumps generated by the two sources move in intersecting
directions that make a half angle of approximately 15 degrees and collide in
the centerplane between the sources. A steep depression is formed during the
collision, but this depression quickly decreases in amplitude while radiating
small-amplitude radial waves. After the collision, a quasi-stable pattern is
formed with several rows of localized depressions that are qualitatively
similar to lumps but exhibit periodic amplitude oscillations, similar to a
breather. The shape of the wave pattern and the period of oscillations depend
strongly on the distance between the sources.

Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. However, their high sensitivity to external
fields also makes them poor sensors of DC fields. Indeed, the usual method of
Ramsey magnetometry leaves them prone to environmental noise, limiting the
allowable interrogation time to the short dephasing time T2*. Here we introduce
a hybridized magnetometery platform, consisting of a sensor and ancilla, that
allows sensing static magnetic fields with interrogation times up to the much
longer T2 coherence time, allowing significant potential gains in field
sensitivity. While more generally applicable, we demonstrate the method for an
electronic NV sensor and a nuclear ancilla. It relies on frequency upconversion
of transverse DC fields through the ancilla, allowing quantum lock-in detection
with low-frequency noise rejection. In our experiments, we demonstrate
sensitivities better than 6uT/vHz, comparable to the Ramsey method, and
narrow-band signal noise filtering better than 64kHz. With technical
optimization, we expect more than an one order of magnitude improvement in each

combination with the Ramsey detection of longitudinal fields, it ushers in a

comparably inactive as a quiescent galaxy (QG). It has been speculated that the
quenched component contained in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is the reason why
the star formation main sequence (MS) has a shallow slope at high masses. In
this paper, we present a toy model to quantify the quenched mass portion of
SFGs ($f_{\rm Q}$) at fixed stellar mass ($M_{\ast}$) and to reconcile the MS
slopes both in the low and the high mass regimes. In this model, each SFG is
composed by a star-forming plus a quenched component. The mass of the
star-forming component ($M_{\rm SF}$) correlates with the star formation rate
(SFR) following a relation SFR $\propto M_{\rm SF}^{\alpha_{\rm SF}}$, where
$\alpha_{\rm SF}\sim 1.0$ . The quenched component contributes to the stellar
mass but does not to the SFR. It is thus possible to quantify $f_{\rm Q}$ based
on the departure of the observed MS slope $\alpha$ from $\alpha_{\rm SF}$.
Adopting the redshift-dependent MS slope reported by \citet{Whitaker 2014}, we
explore the evolution of the $f_{\rm Q}-M_{\ast}$ relations over $z=[0.5,2.5]$.
We find that Milky-Way mass SFGs (with $M_{\ast}\approx 10^{10.7}M_{\odot}$)
typically have a $f_{\rm Q}=30\%-40\%$ at $z\sim 2.25$, whereas this value
rapidly rises up to $70\%-80\%$ at $z\sim 0.75$. The origin of an $\alpha\sim
1.0$ MS slope seen in the low mass regime is also discussed. We argue for a
scenario in which the majority of low mass SFGs stay in a ""steady-stage"" star
formation phase. In this phase, the SFR is mainly regulated by stellar feedback
and not significantly influenced by the quenching mechanisms, thus keeping
roughly constant over cosmic time. This scenario successfully produces an
$\alpha \sim 1.0$ MS slope, as well as the observed MS evolution from $z=2.5$
to $z=0$ at low masses.

stellar merger that was identified to be undergoing a common envelope
transient. To understand the properties of its binary progenitor, the
pre-outburst light curves were analyzed by using the W-D method. The
photometric solution of the 2002 light curve shows that it is a deep contact
binary (f = 89.5(+-40.5)%) with a mass ratio of 0.094. The asymmetry of the
light curve is explained by the presence of a dark spot on the more massive
component. The extremely high fill-out factor suggests that the merging of the
contact binary is driven by dynamical mass loss from the outer Lagrange point.
However, the analysis of the 2004 light curve indicates that no solutions were
obtained even at an extremely low mass ratio of q = 0.03. This suggests that
the common convective envelope of the binary system disappeared and the
secondary component spiraled into the envelope of the primary in 2004. Finally,
the ejection of the envelope of the primary produced the outburst.

  distributions",,,"10.1002/2017WR020906",,"math.OC stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ensemble smoother (ES) has been widely used in inverse modeling of hydrologic
systems. However, for problems where the distribution of model parameters is
multimodal, using ES directly would be problematic. One popular solution is to
use a clustering algorithm to identify each mode and update the clusters with
ES separately. However, this strategy may not be very efficient when the
dimension of parameter space is high or the number of modes is large.
Alternatively, we propose in this paper a very simple and efficient algorithm,
i.e., the iterative local updating ensemble smoother (ILUES), to explore
multimodal distributions of model parameters in nonlinear hydrologic systems.
The ILUES algorithm works by updating local ensembles of each sample with ES to
explore possible multimodal distributions. To achieve satisfactory data matches
in nonlinear problems, we adopt an iterative form of ES to assimilate the
measurements multiple times. Numerical cases involving nonlinearity and
multimodality are tested to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.
It is shown that overall the ILUES algorithm can well quantify the parametric
uncertainties of complex hydrologic models, no matter whether the multimodal
distribution exists.

robotics applications. These problems are often formulated as stochastic
optimal control problems and solved using dynamic programming algorithms.
Unfortunately, most existing algorithms that guarantee convergence to optimal
solutions suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the run time of the
algorithm grows exponentially with the dimension of the state space of the
system. We propose novel dynamic programming algorithms that alleviate the
curse of dimensionality in problems that exhibit certain low-rank structure.
The proposed algorithms are based on continuous tensor decompositions recently
developed by the authors. Essentially, the algorithms represent
high-dimensional functions (e.g., the value function) in a compressed format,
and directly perform dynamic programming computations (e.g., value iteration,
policy iteration) in this format. Under certain technical assumptions, the new
algorithms guarantee convergence towards optimal solutions with arbitrary
precision. Furthermore, the run times of the new algorithms scale polynomially
with the state dimension and polynomially with the ranks of the value function.
This approach realizes substantial computational savings in ""compressible""
problem instances, where value functions admit low-rank approximations. We
demonstrate the new algorithms in a wide range of problems, including a
simulated six-dimensional agile quadcopter maneuvering example and a
seven-dimensional aircraft perching example. In some of these examples, we
estimate computational savings of up to ten orders of magnitude over standard
value iteration algorithms. We further demonstrate the algorithms running in
real time on board a quadcopter during a flight experiment under motion
capture.

we conducted photoemission (PES) experiments using soft x-rays. The spectral
shape of the Ru 4d derived peak near the Fermi level changes significantly with
increasing x. This variation indicates that a spectral weight transfer from the
coherent to incoherent component occurs due to an enhancement of the electron
correlation effect. Resonant PES experiments at the La 3d_{5/2} edge have
confirmed that there is no significant contribution of the La 5d state in the
energy range where the spectral weight transfer is observed. Using the
dependence of the photoelectron mean free path on the photon energy, we
subtracted the surface components from the PES spectra and confirmed that the
enhancement of the electron correlation effect with La doping is an intrinsic
bulk phenomenon. On the other hand, a large portion of the coherent component
remains at the Fermi level up to x = 0.5, reflecting that the Ru 4d state still
has itinerant characteristics. Moreover, we found that the PES spectra hardly
depend on the temperature and do not exhibit a discernible change with magnetic
ordering, suggesting that the temperature variation of the exchange splitting
does not follow the prediction of the Stoner theory. The presently obtained
experimental results indicate that the electron correlation effect plays an
important role in Sr1-xLaxRuO3 and that the Ru 4d electrons possess both local

thought that count-based methods cannot be applied in high-dimensional state
spaces, since most states will only occur once. Recent deep RL exploration
strategies are able to deal with high-dimensional continuous state spaces
through complex heuristics, often relying on optimism in the face of
uncertainty or intrinsic motivation. In this work, we describe a surprising
finding: a simple generalization of the classic count-based approach can reach
near state-of-the-art performance on various high-dimensional and/or continuous
deep RL benchmarks. States are mapped to hash codes, which allows to count
their occurrences with a hash table. These counts are then used to compute a
reward bonus according to the classic count-based exploration theory. We find
that simple hash functions can achieve surprisingly good results on many
challenging tasks. Furthermore, we show that a domain-dependent learned hash
code may further improve these results. Detailed analysis reveals important
aspects of a good hash function: 1) having appropriate granularity and 2)
encoding information relevant to solving the MDP. This exploration strategy
achieves near state-of-the-art performance on both continuous control tasks and
Atari 2600 games, hence providing a simple yet powerful baseline for solving
MDPs that require considerable exploration.

how to break the spin-valley degeneracy of electron beams spatially. We propose
a spin-valley beam splitter in a gated ferromagnetic/pristine/strained graphene
structure. We demonstrate that, in a full resonant tunneling regime for all
spin-valley beam components, the formation of quasi-standing waves can lead
four giant lateral Goos-H\""{a}nchen shifts as large as the transverse beam
width, while the interplay of the two modulated regions can lead difference of
resonant angles or energies for the four spin-valley flavors, manifesting an
effective spin-valley beam splitting effect. The beam splitting effect is found
to be controllable by the gating and strain.

observable for a finite-volume galaxy survey, are both related to the Hessian
of large-scale gravitational potential and therefore of equal importance. We
show that the coherent tidal force causes a homogeneous anisotropic distortion
of the observed distribution of galaxies in all three directions, perpendicular

bright AGNs by exploiting the data base of the University of Michigan Radio
Astronomy Observatory (UMRAO) monitoring program. We model the periodograms
(temporal power spectra) of the observed lightcurves as simple power-law noise
(red noise, spectral power $P(f)\propto f^{-\beta}$) using Monte Carlo
simulations, taking into account windowing effects (red-noise leak, aliasing).
The power spectra of 39 (out of 43) sources are in good agreement with the
models, yielding a range in power spectral index ($\beta$) from $\approx$1 to
$\approx$3. We fit a Gaussian function to each flare in a given lightcurve to
obtain the flare duration. We discover a correlation between $\beta$ and the
median duration of the flares. We use the derivative of a lightcurve to obtain
a characteristic variability timescale which does not depend on the assumed
functional form of the flares, incomplete fitting, and so on. We find that,
once the effects of relativistic Doppler boosting are corrected for, the
variability timescales of our sources are proportional to the accretion rate to
the power of $0.25\pm 0.03$ over five orders of magnitude in accretion rate,
regardless of source type. We further find that modeling the periodograms of
four of our sources requires the assumption of broken powerlaw spectra. From
simulating lightcurves as superpositions of exponential flares we conclude that
strong overlap of flares leads to featureless simple power-law periodograms of
AGNs at radio wavelengths in most cases.

galactic-scale strong gravitational lensing (SGL) systems to constrain the
statistic property of SGL system, as well as the curvature of universe without
assuming any fiducial cosmological model. Based on the singular isothermal
ellipsoid (SIE) model of SGL system, we obtain that the constrained curvature
parameter $\Omega_{\rm k}$ is close to zero from the SGL data, which is
consistent with the latest result of planck measurement. More interestingly, we
find that the parameter $f$ in the SIE model is strongly correlated with the
curvature $\Omega_{\rm k}$. Neglecting this correlation in the analysis will
significantly overestimate the constraining power of SGL data on the curvature.
Furthermore, the obtained constraint on $f$ is different from previous results:
$f=1.105\pm0.030$ ($68\%$ C.L.), which means that the standard singular
isothermal sphere (SIS) model ($f=1$) is disfavored by the current SGL data at
more than $3\sigma$ confidence level. We also divide the whole SGL data into
two parts according to the centric stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm c}$
and find that the larger value of $\sigma_{\rm c}$ the subsample has, the more
favored the standard SIS model is. Finally, we extend the SIE model by assuming
the power-law density profiles for the total mass density,
$\rho=\rho_0(r/r_0)^{-\alpha}$, and luminosity density,
$\nu=\nu_0(r/r_0)^{-\delta}$, and obtain the constraints on the power-law

results show that the reactivity on surface dimers fully enclosed by hydrogen
covered atoms is essentially unchanged compared to the clean surface. This is
confirmed by our scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements. On the contrary,
adsorption sites with partially covered surface dimers show a drastic increase
in reactivity. This is due to a lowering of the reaction barrier by more than
fifty percent compared to the clean surface, which is in line with previous
experiments. Adsorption on dimers enclosed by molecule (ethylene) covered
surface atoms is reported to have a highly decreased reactivity, a result of
destabilization of the intermediate state due to steric repulsion, as
quantified with the periodic energy decomposition analysis (pEDA). Furthermore,
an approach for the calculation of Gibbs energies of adsorption based on
statistical thermodynamics considerations is applied to the system. The results
show that the loss in molecular entropy leads to a significant destabilization

In this paper, inspired
by the supervenience-determined consequence relation and the semantics of
agreement operator, we introduce a modal logic of supervenience, which has a
dyadic operator of supervenience as a sole modality. The semantics of
supervenience modality is very natural to correspond to the
supervenience-determined consequence relation, in a quite similar way that the
strict implication corresponds to the inference-determined consequence
relation. We show that this new logic is more expressive than the modal logic
of agreement, by proposing a notion of bisimulation for the latter logic. We
provide a sound proof system for our new logic. We also lift on to more general
logics of supervenience. Related to this, we compare propositional logic of
determinacy and non-contingency in expressive powers, and give axiomatizations
of propositional logic of determinacy over various classes of frames, thereby
resolving an open research direction listed
in~\cite[Sec.~8.2]{Gorankoetal:2016}. As a corollary, we also present an
alternative axiomatization for propositional logic of determinacy over
universal models. We conclude with a lot of future work.

method, which divides the sample into sectors. This speeds-up the computations
with no loss of accuracy, while enabling efficient parallelization. This method
could also be applied to model transients in linear materials or networks of

of the fact that it is often met in material characterization and bulk

level of consciousness. There is experimental evidence that general anesthesia
impacts large scale functional networks leading to alterations in the brain
state. However, the way anesthetics affect the structure assumed by functional
connectivity in different brain regions have not been reported yet. Within this
context, the present study has sought to characterize the functional brain
networks respective to the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes. In
this experiment, electro-physiological neural activity was recorded through the
use of a dense ECoG-electrode array positioned directly over the cortical
surface of an old world monkey of the species Macaca fuscata. Networks were
serially estimated over time at each five seconds, while the animal model was
under controlled experimental conditions of an anesthetic induction process. In
each one of the four cortical brain lobes, prominent alterations on distinct
properties of the networks evidenced a transition in the networks architecture,
which occurred within about one and a half minutes after the administration of
the anesthetics. The characterization of functional brain networks performed in
this study represents important experimental evidence and brings new knowledge

existing stochastic strategy that keeps the forward velocity constant and
controls only the angular velocity, we design a stochastic extremum seeking
controller to regulate both forward and angular velocities simultaneously in
this work. Thus, the vehicle decelerates near the source and stays within a
small area as if it comes to a full stop, which solves the overshoot problem in
the constant forward velocity case. We use the stochastic averaging theory to
prove the local exponential convergence, both almost surely and in probability,
to a small neighborhood near the source for elliptical level sets. Finally,

our main result do not depend on the parametrization of the periodic wave

asymptotic regime of rapid rotation, where a balance is thought to hold between
the Coriolis, pressure, buoyancy and Lorentz forces (the MAC balance).
Classical numerical solutions have previously been obtained in a regime of
moderate rotation where viscous and inertial forces are still significant. We
define a unidimensional path in parameter space between classical models and
asymptotic conditions from the requirements to enforce a MAC balance and to
preserve the ratio between the magnetic diffusion and convective overturn times
(the magnetic Reynolds number). Direct numerical simulations performed along
this path show that the spatial structure of the solution at scales larger than
the magnetic dissipation length is largely invariant. This enables the
definition of large-eddy simulations resting on the assumption that small-scale
details of the hydrodynamic turbulence are irrelevant to the determination of
the large-scale asymptotic state. These simulations are shown to be in good
agreement with direct simulations in the range where both are feasible, and can
be computed for control parameter values far beyond the current state of the
art, such as an Ekman number $E=10^{-8}$. We obtain strong-field convective
dynamos approaching the MAC balance and a Taylor state to an unprecedented
degree of accuracy. The physical connection between classical models and
asymptotic conditions is shown to be devoid of abrupt transitions,
demonstrating the asymptotic relevance of classical numerical dynamo
mechanisms. The fields of the system are confirmed to follow diffusivity-free,
power-based scaling laws along the path.

sister chromatids of the duplicated genome are not separated and distributed to
the spindle poles before all chromosomes have been properly linked to the
microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Biochemically, the SAC delays cell cycle
progression by preventing activation of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C)
or cyclosome; whose activation by Cdc20 is required for sister-chromatid
separation, which marks the transition into anaphase. In response to activation
of the checkpoint, various species control the activity of both APC/C and
Cdc20. However, the underlying regulatory pathways remain largely elusive. In
this study, five possible model variants of APC/C regulation were constructed,
namely BubR1, Mad2, MCC, MCF2 and an all-pathways model variant. These models
are validated with experimental data from the literature. A wide range of
parameter values have been tested to find critical values of the APC binding
rate. The results show that all variants are able to capture the wild type
behaviour of the APC. However, only one model variant, which included both MCC
as well as BubR1 as potent inhibitors of the APC, was able to reproduce both
wild type and mutant type behaviour of APC regulation. The presented work has
successfully distinguished between five competing dynamical models of the same
biological system using a systems biology approach. Furthermore, the results
suggest that systems-level approach is vital for molecular biology and could
also be used for compare the pathways of relevance with the objective to
generate hypotheses and improve our understanding.

Parkinson's Disease (PD), studying the associated functional connectivity (FC)
changes seems a promising approach toward developing non-invasive and
non-radioactive neuroimaging markers for this disease. While several groups
have reported such FC changes in PD, there are also significant discrepancies
between studies. Investigating the reproducibility of PD-related FC changes on
independent datasets is therefore of crucial importance. We acquired
resting-state fMRI scans for 43 subjects (27 patients , 16 controls) and
compared the observed FC changes with those obtained in 2 independent datasets,
one made available by the PPMI consortium and a second one by the group of Tao
Wu. Unfortunately, PD-related functional connectivity changes turned out to be
non-reproducible across datasets. This could be due to disease heterogeneity,
but also to technical differences. To distinguish between the two, we devised a
method to directly check for disease heterogeneity using random splits of a
single dataset. Since we still observe non-reproducibility in a large fraction
of random splits of the same dataset, we conclude that functional heterogeneity
may be a dominating factor behind the lack of reproducibility of FC alterations
in different rs-fMRI studies of PD. While global PD-related functional
connectivity changes were non-reproducible across datasets, we identified a few
individual brain region pairs with marginally consistent FC changes across all
three datasets. However, training classifiers on each one of the 3 datasets to
discriminate PD scans from controls produced only low accuracies on the
remaining two test datasets. Moreover, classifiers trained and tested on random
splits of the same dataset (which are technically homogeneous) also had low
test accuracies, directly substantiating disease heterogeneity.

outer layers of the solar corona at very high speed, mainly composed by protons
and electrons, with a small percentage of helium nuclei and a significantly
lower abundance of heavier ions. Since particle collisions are practically
negligible, the solar wind is typically not in a state of thermodynamic
equilibrium. Such a complex system must be described through self-consistent
and fully nonlinear models, taking into account its multi-species composition
and turbulence. We use a kinetic hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell numerical code to
reproduce the turbulent energy cascade down to ion kinetic scales, in typical
conditions of the uncontaminated solar wind plasma, with the aim of exploring
the differential kinetic dynamics of the dominant ion species, namely protons
and alpha particles. We show that the response of different species to the
fluctuating electromagnetic fields is different. In particular, a significant
differential heating of alphas with respect to protons is observed.
Interestingly, the preferential heating process occurs in spatial regions
nearby the peaks of ion vorticity and where strong deviations from
thermodynamic equilibrium are recovered. Moreover, by feeding a simulator of a
top-hat ion spectrometer with the output of the kinetic simulations, we show
that measurements by such spectrometer planned on board the Turbulence Heating
ObserveR (THOR mission), a candidate for the next M4 space mission of the
European Space Agency, can provide detailed three-dimensional ion velocity
distributions, highlighting important non-Maxwellian features. These results
support the idea that future space missions will allow a deeper understanding
of the physics of the interplanetary medium.

fields; their generation and dissipation are fundamental problems in solar
physics. Light bridges are commonly present during sunspot decay, but a
comprehensive picture of their role in the removal of photospheric magnetic
field is still missing. We study the three dimensional configuration of a
sunspot and in particular its light bridge during one of the last stages of its
decay. We present the magnetic and thermodynamical stratification inferred from
full Stokes inversions of the photospheric Si I 10827 \AA\ and Ca I 10839 \AA\
lines obtained with the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph of the GREGOR telescope at
Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife, Spain. The analysis is complemented by a
study of continuum images covering the disk passage of the active region, which
are provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar
Dynamics Observatory. The sunspot shows a light bridge with penumbral continuum
intensity that separates the central umbra from a smaller umbra. We find that
in this region the magnetic field lines form a canopy with lower magnetic field
strength in the inner part. The photospheric light bridge is dominated by gas
pressure (high-$\beta$), as opposed to the surrounding umbra where the magnetic
pressure is higher. A convective flow is observed in the light bridge. This
flow is able to bend the magnetic field lines and to produce field reversals.
The field lines close above the light bridge and become as vertical and strong
as in the surrounding umbra. We conclude that it develops because of two highly
magnetized regions which come closer during the sunspot evolution.

the family of Earth-like planets, such as Venus, this physical mechanism
coupled with solid tides makes the angular velocity evolve over long timescales
and determines the equilibrium configurations of their spin. Contrary to the
solid core, the atmosphere is submitted to both tidal gravitational potential
and insolation flux coming from the star. The complex response of the gas is
intrinsically linked to its physical properties. This dependence has to be
characterized and quantified to study the large variety of extrasolar planetary
systems. We develop a theoretical global model where radiative losses, which
are predominant in slowly rotating atmospheres, are taken into account. We
analytically compute the tidal perturbation of pressure, density, temperature
and velocity field from which we deduce the expressions of atmospheric Love
numbers and tidal torque exerted by the star. The dynamics of atmospheric tides
depends on the frequency regime of the tidal perturbation: the thermal regime
near synchronization and the dynamical regime characterizing fast-rotating
planets. The dependence of the torque on the tidal frequency is quantified for
Earth-like and Venus-like exoplanets and is in good agreement with the results
given by Global Climate Models (GCM) simulations. Introducing dissipative
processes such as radiation regularizes the tidal response of the atmosphere,
otherwise it is singular at synchronization. We demonstrate the important role
played by the physical and dynamical properties of a super-Earth atmosphere
(e.g. Coriolis, stratification, background pressure, density, temperature,
radiative emission) and point out the key parameters defining tidal regimes

operators, we specifically consider two different boundary configurations for a
strip of critical Ising spins: (I) alternating equi-sized domains of up and
down spins on both sides of the strip, with a possible lateral shift, and (II)
alternating domains of up and down spins of different size on one side and
homogeneously fixed spins on the other side of the strip. Asymptotic results

action models, we consider both household-based vaccination schemes, in which
the way in which individuals are chosen for vaccination depends on the size of
the households in which they reside, and acquaintance vaccination, which
targets individuals of high degree in the social network. For both types of
vaccination scheme, assuming a large population with few initial infectives, we
derive a threshold parameter which determines whether or not a large outbreak
can occur and also the probability and fraction of the population infected by
such an outbreak. The performance of these schemes is studied numerically,
focusing on the influence of the household size distribution and the degree
distribution of the social network. We find that acquaintance vaccination can
significantly outperform the best household-based scheme if the degree
distribution of the social network is heavy-tailed. For household-based
schemes, when the vaccine coverage is insufficient to prevent a major outbreak
and the vaccine is imperfect, we find situations in which both the probability
and size of a major outbreak under the scheme which minimises the threshold
parameter are \emph{larger} than in the scheme which maximises the threshold

heterogeneous networks (HetNets) in which massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) macro cell base station (BS) equipped with a large
number of antennas, overlaid with wireless self-backhauled small cells (SCs)
are assumed. Self-backhauled SC BSs with full-duplex communication employing
regular antenna arrays serve both macro users and SC users by using the
wireless backhaul from macro BS in the same frequency band. We formulate the
joint load balancing and interference mitigation problem as a network utility
maximization subject to wireless backhaul constraints. Subsequently, leveraging
the framework of stochastic optimization, the problem is decoupled into dynamic
scheduling of macro cell users, backhaul provisioning of SCs, and offloading
macro cell users to SCs as a function of interference and backhaul links. Via
numerical results, we show the performance gains of our proposed framework
under the impact of small cells density, number of base station antennas, and
transmit power levels at low and high frequency bands. We further provide
insights into the performance analysis and convergence of the proposed
framework. The numerical results show that the proposed user association
algorithm outperforms other baselines. Interestingly, we find that even at
lower frequency band the performance of open access small cell is close to that
of closed access at some operating points, the open access full- duplex small
cell still yields higher gain as compared to the closed access at higher
frequency bands. With increasing the small cell density or the wireless
backhaul quality, the open access full- duplex small cells outperform and
achieve a 5.6x gain in terms of cell-edge performance as compared to the closed
access ones in ultra-dense networks with 350 small cell base stations per km2 .

outperforms many contemporary bag-of-words techniques in accurately computing
document similarity, and on practical applications such as document clustering.

reduced-gravity is simulated by releasing a free-falling projectile into a
surface container with a downward acceleration less than that of Earth's
gravity. The acceleration of the surface is controlled through the use of an
Atwood machine, or a system of pulleys and counterweights. The starting height
of the surface container and the initial separation distance between the
projectile and surface are variable and chosen to accommodate collision
velocities up to 20 cm/s and effective accelerations of ~0.1 - 1.0 m/s^2.
Accelerometers, placed on the surface container and inside the projectile,
provide acceleration data, while high-speed cameras capture the collision and
act as secondary data sources. The experiment is built into an existing 5.5 m
drop-tower frame and requires the custom design of all components, including
the projectile, surface sample container, release mechanism and deceleration
system. Data from calibration tests verify the efficiency of the experiment's
deceleration system and provide a quantitative understanding of the performance
of the Atwood system.

between the brain of an user and an external device, as a computer or a machine
in general. One of the most used brain responses to implement non-invasive BCIs
is the so called steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP). This periodic
response is generated when an user gazes to a light flickering at a constant
frequency. The SSVEP response can be detected in the user's
electroencephalogram (EEG) at the corresponding frequency of the attended
flickering stimulus. In SSVEP based BCIs, multiple stimuli, flickering at
different frequencies, are commonly presented to the user, where to each
stimulus is associated a command for an actuator. One of the limitations to a
wider adoption of BCIs is given by the need of EEG acquisition devices and
software tools which are commonly not meant for end-user usage. In this work,
exploiting state-of-the-art software tools, the use of a low cost easy to wear
single electrode EEG device is demonstrated to be exploitable to implement
simple SSVEP based BCIs. The obtained results, although less impressive than
the ones obtainable with professional EEG equipment, are interesting in view of

The measured data is compared with simulations based on a first-principles
description of the electronic structure of the material. From this comparison,
the number of hBN layers and the separation between the lowest hBN layer and
the nickel surface is deduced. The coupling of interlayer states of the hBN to
both image-potential and Shockley-type surface states of the nickel is
discussed, and the dependence of the reflectivity spectra on the surface

simulations combined with prompt photons from hard scattering and the thermal
photons from hadron gas to analyze the spectra and anisotropic flow of direct
photons at RHIC and LHC. The results from different sources responsible for the
thermal photons in the quark gluon plasma (QGP) including the weakly coupled
QGP (wQGP) from perturbative calculations, strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}$=4

phenomenological model mimicking the strongly coupled QGP (sQGP) are then
compared. It is found that the direct-photon spectra are enhanced in the
strongly coupled scenario compared with the ones in the wQGP, especially at
intermediate and high momenta, which improve the agreements with data.
Moreover, by using IP-glassma initial states, both the elliptic flow and
triangular flow of direct photons are amplified at high momenta ($p_T$>2.5 GeV)
for V-QCD, while they are suppressed at low momenta compared to wQGP. The
distinct results in holography stem from the blue-shift of emission rates in
strong coupling. In addition, the spectra and flow in small collision systems
were evaluated for future comparisons. It is found that thermal photons from
the deconfined phase are substantial to reconcile the spectra and flow at high

approximation of ES in terms of multiple quantiles of a distribution proposed
in Emmer et al. (2015). By comparing Pearson, Nass and likelihood-ratio tests

powerful at detecting misspecifications of trading book loss models than
standard binomial exception tests corresponding to the case $N=1$. Each test
has its merits: Pearson offers simplicity; Nass is robust in its size
properties to the choice of $N$; the LRT is very powerful though slightly
over-sized in small samples and more computationally burdensome. A

time delays of the multiple images could provide tight constraints on the

in a rich variety of real-world tasks, e.g., subspace segmentation and image
categorization. Most low-rank methods are incapable of capturing
low-dimensional subspace for supervised learning tasks, e.g., classification
and regression. This paper aims to learn both the discriminant low-rank
representation (LRR) and the robust projecting subspace in a supervised manner.
To achieve this goal, we cast the problem into a constrained rank minimization
framework by adopting the least squares regularization. Naturally, the data
label structure tends to resemble that of the corresponding low-dimensional
representation, which is derived from the robust subspace projection of clean
data by low-rank learning. Moreover, the low-dimensional representation of
original data can be paired with some informative structure by imposing an
appropriate constraint, e.g., Laplacian regularizer. Therefore, we propose a
novel constrained LRR method. The objective function is formulated as a
constrained nuclear norm minimization problem, which can be solved by the
inexact augmented Lagrange multiplier algorithm. Extensive experiments on image
classification, human pose estimation, and robust face recovery have confirmed
the superiority of our method.

yields much lower Lorentz factors that are in tension with the constraints set
by the electron pair Compoton scattering process. We then suggest that these

in their optical properties and thus regulation of both OV concentration and
type via external strain is crucial to exploration of more applications.
First-principle calculations of SnO2 (110) surface disclose that asymmetric
deformations induced by external strain not only lead to its intrinsic surface
elastic changes, but also result in different OV formation energy. In the
absence of external strain, the energetically favorable oxygen vacancies (EFOV)
appear in the bridging site of second layer. When -3.5% external strain is
applied along y direction, the EFOV moves into plane site. This can be ascribed
that the compressed deformation gives rise to redistribution of electronic wave
function near OVs, therefore, formation of newly bond structures. Our results
suggest that different type OVs in SnO2 surface can be controlled by strain
engineering.

time for the model in which the interaction between dark energy and dark matter
is inspired by disformal transformation. We extend the analysis in the existing
literature by supposing that the disformal coefficient depends both on the
scalar field and its kinetic terms. We find that the dependence of the
disformal coefficient on the kinetic term of scalar field leads to two classes
of the scaling fixed points that can describe the acceleration of the universe
at late time. The first class exists only for the case where the disformal
coefficient depends on the kinetic terms. The fixed points in this class are
saddle points unless the slope of the conformal coefficient is sufficiently
large. The second class can be viewed as the generalization of the fixed points
studied in the literature. According to the stability analysis of these fixed
points, we find that the stable fixed point can take two different physically
relevant values for the same value of the parameters of the model. These
different values of the fixed points can be reached for different initial

Mielnik and Cantoni, for spacetime quantum states in loop quantum gravity.
First, we show that loop quantum gravity admits the structures of transition
probability spaces. This is exemplified by first checking such structures in
covariant quantum mechanics, and then identify the transition probability
spaces in spin foam models via a simplified discrete version of general
boundary formulation. The transition probability space thus defined gives a
simple way to reconstruct the discrete analog of the Hilbert space of the
canonical theory and the relevant quantum logical structures. Second, we show
that the transition probability space and in particular the spin foam model are
2-categories. Then we discuss how to realize in spin foam models two proposals
by Crane about the mathematical structures of quantum gravity, namely the
quantum topos and causal sites. We conclude that transition probability spaces
provide us with an alternative framework to understand various foundational
questions of loop quantum gravity.

polytropic equation of state are studied in spacetimes with a repulsive
cosmological constant. The configurations are specified in terms of three
parameters---the polytropic index $n$, the ratio of central pressure and
central energy density of matter $\sigma$, and the ratio of energy density of
vacuum and central density of matter $\lambda$. The static equilibrium
configurations are determined by two coupled first-order nonlinear differential
equations that are solved by numerical methods with the exception of polytropes
with $n=0$ corresponding to the configurations with a uniform distribution of
energy density, when the solution is given in terms of elementary functions.
The geometry of the polytropes is conveniently represented by embedding
diagrams of both the ordinary space geometry and the optical reference geometry
reflecting some dynamical properties of the geodesic motion. The polytropes are
represented by radial profiles of energy density, pressure, mass, and metric
coefficients. For all tested values of $n>0$, the static equilibrium
configurations with fixed parameters $n$, $\sigma$, are allowed only up to a
critical value of the cosmological parameter
$\lambda_{\mathrm{c}}=\lambda_{\mathrm{c}}(n,\sigma)$. In the case of $n>3$,
the critical value $\lambda_{\mathrm{c}}$ tends to zero for special values of
$\sigma$. The gravitational potential energy and the binding energy of the
polytropes are determined and studied by numerical methods. We discuss in
detail the polytropes with an extension comparable to those of the dark matter
halos related to galaxies, i.e., with extension $\ell > 100\,\mathrm{kpc}$ and
mass $M > 10^{12}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. ...

of forest fires in Portugal using the sandbox method. The general procedure is
the following: (a) define a circle centred in each and all events with
increasing radius R; (b) count the number of other events located within the
circle of radius R, N(R); (c) plot the growth curve which is the functional
dependence of N(R) versus R; and (d) estimate the local fractal dimension as
the slope on log[N(R)] versus log[R]. The computation is carried out by using
the location of every fire event as a centre but without the final averaging
over all the fires for a given R, which is usually performed to get a global
fractal dimension and to estimate global clustering. Sandbox method is widely
used in many applications in physics and other subjects. The local procedure
has the ability to provide the most complete information regarding the spatial
distribution of clustering and avoiding non-homogeneity and non-stationarity
problems. Most of the analysis was performed using the National Mapping Burnt
Area (NMBA) database which accounts for 32,156 fires during the 1975 - 2013
period. The results of local analysis are compared with a randomly generated
pattern in forest zones (validity domain). The results demonstrate interesting
local spatial patterns of clustering. Some results on global measures are
reported as well.

in computer vision and machine learning. Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is
one of such models that is simple but powerful. However, its restricted form
also has placed heavy constraints on the models representation power and
scalability. Many extensions have been invented based on RBM in order to
produce deeper architectures with greater power. The most famous ones among
them are deep belief network, which stacks multiple layer-wise pretrained RBMs
to form a hybrid model, and deep Boltzmann machine, which allows connections
between hidden units to form a multi-layer structure. In this paper, we present
a new method to compose RBMs to form a multi-layer network style architecture
and a training method that trains all layers jointly. We call the resulted
structure deep restricted Boltzmann network. We further explore the combination
of convolutional RBM with the normal fully connected RBM, which is made trivial
under our composition framework. Experiments show that our model can generate
descent images and outperform the normal RBM significantly in terms of image
quality and feature quality, without losing much efficiency for training.

are rapidly driven by a homogeneous time-periodic light and linearly coupled to
vibrational modes. Starting from a generic time-periodic electron-phonon
Hamiltonian, we derive a time-independent effective Hamiltonian that describes
the stroboscopic dynamics up to the third order in the high-frequency limit.
This yields nonequilibrium corrections to the electron-phonon coupling that are
controllable dynamically via the driving strength. This shows in particular
that local Holstein interactions in equilibrium are corrected by nonlocal
Peierls interactions out of equilibrium, as well as by phonon-assisted hopping
processes that make the dynamical Wannier-Stark localization of Bloch electrons
impossible. Subsequently, we revisit the Holstein polaron problem out of
equilibrium in terms of effective Green functions, and specify explicitly how
the binding energy and effective mass of the polaron can be controlled
dynamically. These tunable properties are reported within the weak- and
strong-coupling regimes since both can be visited within the same material when
varying the driving strength. This work provides some insight into controllable
microscopic mechanisms that may be involved during the multicycle laser
irradiations of organic molecular crystals in ultrafast pump-probe experiments,
