To appear in Physical Review D",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.94.114505",,"hep-lat","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate whether the stationary solution of the Fokker-Planck equation
of the complex Langevin algorithm reproduces the correct expectation values.
When the complex Langevin algorithm for an action $S(x)$ is convergent, it
produces an equivalent complex probability distribution $P(x)$ which ideally
would coincide with $e^{-S(x)}$. We show that the projected Fokker-Planck
equation fulfilled by $P(x)$ may contain an anomalous term whose form is made
explicit. Such term spoils the relation $P(x)=e^{-S(x)}$, introducing a bias in
the expectation values. Through the analysis of several periodic and
non-periodic one-dimensional problems, using either exact or numerical
solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation on the complex plane, it is shown that
the anomaly is present quite generally. In fact, an anomaly is expected
whenever the Langevin walker needs only a finite time to go to infinity and
come back, and this is the case for typical actions. We conjecture that the
anomaly is the rule rather than the exception in the one-dimensional case,
however, this could change as the number of variables involved increases.

  Persistent Homology Analysis",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, compressed sensing (CS) computed tomography (CT) using sparse
projection views has been extensively investigated to reduce the potential risk
of radiation to patient. However, due to the insufficient number of projection
views, an analytic reconstruction approach results in severe streaking
artifacts and CS-based iterative approach is computationally very expensive. To
address this issue, here we propose a novel deep residual learning approach for
sparse view CT reconstruction. Specifically, based on a novel persistent
homology analysis showing that the manifold of streaking artifacts is
topologically simpler than original ones, a deep residual learning architecture
that estimates the streaking artifacts is developed. Once a streaking artifact
image is estimated, an artifact-free image can be obtained by subtracting the
streaking artifacts from the input image. Using extensive experiments with real
patient data set, we confirm that the proposed residual learning provides
significantly better image reconstruction performance with several orders of
magnitude faster computational speed.

transcendental extension of valued fields. In order to study such an extension,
M. Vaqui\'e, generalizing an earlier construction of S. Mac Lane, introduced
the notion of Key polynomials. In this paper we define a related notion of
\textbf{abstract key polynomials} associated to $\iota$ and study the
relationship between them and key polynomials of Mac Lane -- Vaqui\'e.
Associated to each abstract key polynomial $Q$, we define the truncation
$\mu_{Q}$ of $\mu$ with respect to $Q$ and we study the properties of those
truncations. Roughly speaking, $\mu_{Q}$ is an approximation to $\mu$ defined
by the key polynomial $Q$. We also define the notion of an abstract key
polynomial $Q'$ being an \textbf{immediate successor} of another abstract key
polynomial $Q$ (in this situation we write $Q<Q'$). The main comparison results
proved in this paper are as follows:(1): An abstract key polynomial for $\mu$
is a Mac Lane -- Vaqui\'e key polynomial for the truncated valuation
$\mu_{Q}$.(2): If $Q<Q'$ are two abstract key polynomials for $\mu$ then $Q'$
is a Mac Lane -- Vaqui\'e key polynomial for $\mu_{Q}$. (3) which, for a monic
polynomial $Q\in K[x]$ and a valuation $\mu'$ of $K(x)$, gives a sufficient
condition for $Q$ to be an abstract key polynomial for $\mu'$. Combined with an
earlier result of M. Vaqui\'e, this describes a class of pairs of valuations
$(\mu,\mu')$ such that $Q$ is a Mac Lane -- Vaqui\'e key polynomial for $\mu$

target and recognises its category. In general, it is hard to design a tracking
model suitable for all object categories, e.g., a rigid tracker for a car is
not suitable for a deformable gymnast. Category-based trackers usually achieve
superior tracking performance for the objects of that specific category, but
have difficulties being generalised. Therefore, we propose a novel unified
robust tracking framework which explicitly encodes both generic features and
category-based features. The tracker consists of a shared convolutional network
(NetS), which feeds into two parallel networks, NetC for classification and
NetT for tracking. NetS is pre-trained on ImageNet to serve as a generic
feature extractor across the different object categories for NetC and NetT.
NetC utilises those features within fully connected layers to classify the
object category. NetT has multiple branches, corresponding to multiple
categories, to distinguish the tracked object from the background. Since each
branch in NetT is trained by the videos of a specific category or groups of
similar categories, NetT encodes category-based features for tracking. During
online tracking, NetC and NetT jointly determine the target regions with the
right category and foreground labels for target estimation. To improve the
robustness and precision, NetC and NetT inter-supervise each other and trigger
network adaptation when their outputs are ambiguous for the same image regions
(i.e., when the category label contradicts the foreground/background
classification). We have compared the performance of our tracker to other
state-of-the-art trackers on a large-scale tracking benchmark (100
sequences)---the obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
tracker as it outperformed other 38 state-of-the-art tracking algorithms.

  Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stw3178",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the last decade, several ultra faint objects (UFOs, $M_V\gtrsim-3.5$) have
been discovered in the outer halo of the Milky Way. For some of these objects
it is not clear whether they are star clusters or (ultra-faint) dwarf galaxies.
In this work we quantify the contribution of star clusters to the population of
UFOs. We extrapolated the mass and Galactocentric radius distribution of the
globular clusters using a population model, finding that the Milky Way contains
about $3.3^{+7.3}_{-1.6}$ star clusters with $M_V\gtrsim-3.5$ and
Galactocentric radius $\geq20\,$kpc. To understand whether dissolving clusters
can appear as UFOs, we run a suite of direct $N$-body models, varying the
orbit, the Galactic potential, the binary fraction and the black hole (BH)
natal kick velocities. In the analyses, we consider observational biases such
as: luminosity limit, field stars, and line-of-sight projection. We find that
star clusters contribute to both the compact and the extended population of
UFOs: clusters without BHs appear compact with radii $\sim5\,$pc, while
clusters that retain their BHs after formation have radii $\gtrsim20\,$pc. The
properties of the extended clusters are remarkably similar to those of dwarf
galaxies: high inferred mass-to-light ratios due to binaries; binary properties
mildly affected by dynamical evolution; no observable mass segregation; and
flattened stellar mass function. We conclude that the slope of the stellar mass
function as a function of Galactocentric radius and the presence/absence of
cold streams can discriminate between DM free and DM dominated UFOs.

model anti-persistent or persistent dependency structures in observed time
series. Properties of the autocovariance function of fGn are characterised by
the Hurst exponent (H), which in Bayesian contexts typically has been assigned
a uniform prior on the unit interval. This paper argues why a uniform prior is
unreasonable and introduces the use of a penalised complexity (PC) prior for H.
The PC prior is computed to penalise divergence from the special case of white
noise, and is invariant to reparameterisations. An immediate advantage is that
the exact same prior can be used for the autocorrelation coefficient of a
first-order autoregressive process AR(1), as this model also reflects a
flexible version of white noise. Within the general setting of latent Gaussian
models, this allows us to compare an fGn model component with AR(1) using Bayes
factors, avoiding confounding effects of prior choices for the hyperparameters.
Among others, this is useful in climate regression models where inference for
underlying linear or smooth trends depends heavily on the assumed noise model.

were at odds with the existing theoretical predictions. We aim to redetermine
the oxygen ratios in these stars using new spectral analysis tools and further
develop discussions on the carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios in order to
elucidate this problem. Oxygen isotopic ratios were derived from spectra in the
K-band in a sample of galactic AGB carbon stars of different spectral types and
near solar metallicity. Synthetic spectra calculated in LTE with spherical
carbon-rich atmosphere models and updated molecular line lists were used. The
CNO isotope ratios derived in a homogeneous way, were compared with theoretical
predictions for low-mass (1.5-3 M_o) AGB stars computed with the FUNS code
assuming extra mixing both during the RGB and AGB phases. For most of the stars
the 16O/17O/18O ratios derived are in good agreement with theoretical
predictions confirming that, for AGB stars, are established using the values
reached after the FDU according to the initial stellar mass. This fact, as far
as the oxygen isotopic ratios are concerned, leaves little space for the
operation of any extra mixing mechanism during the AGB phase. Nevertheless, for
a few stars with large 16O/17O/18O, the operation of such a mechanism might be
required, although their observed 12C/13C and 14N/15N ratios would be difficult
to reconcile within this scenario. Furthermore, J-type stars tend to have lower
16O/17O ratios than the normal carbon stars, as already indicated in previous
studies. Excluding these peculiar stars, AGB carbon stars occupy the same
region as pre-solar type I oxide grains in a 17O/16O vs. 18O/16O diagram,
showing little spread. This reinforces the idea that these grains were probably
formed in low-mass stars during the previous O-rich phases.

This is equivalent to the well-known Hirsch Conjecture. Klee proved that the

and conjectured even more, namely that the $W_v$-Path Conjecture is true for
all general cell complexes. This general $W_v$-Path Conjecture was verified for
polyhedral maps on the projective plane and the torus by Barnette, and on the
Klein bottle by Pulapaka and Vince. Let $G$ be a graph polyhedrally embedded in
a surface $\Sigma$, and $x, y$ be two vertices of $G$. In this paper, we show
that if there are three internally disjoint $(x,y)$-paths which are homotopic
to each other, then there exists a $W_v$-path joining $x$ and $y$. For every

$\kappa_G(x,y)+4\chi(\Sigma)-8$ internally disjoint $W_v$-paths joining $x$ and

$W_v$-path problem is related to both the local connectivity $\kappa_G(x,y)$,

quasi-two-dimensional nematically ordered layer of a protein-based active gel
to experimentally demonstrate that the geometry of active flows, which we have
characterized by means of the statistical distribution of eddy sizes, can be
reversibly modified. To this purpose, the active material is prepared in
contact with a thermotropic liquid crystal, whose lamellar smectic-A phase
tiles the water/oil interface with a lattice of anisotropic domains that
feature circular easy-flow directions. The active flow, which arises from the
motion of parabolic folds within the filamentous active material, becomes
effectively confined into circulating eddies that are in registry with the
underlying smectic-A domains. Based on topological arguments applied to the
circular confinement, together with well-known properties of the active
material, we show that the structure of the active flow is determined by a
single intrinsic length scale. The role of this length scale thus reemerges
from setting the decay length in the exponential eddy size distribution of the
free turbulent regime, to determining the minimum size of circulating eddies
featuring a scale-free power law. Our results demonstrate that soft-confinement
provides with an invaluable tool to probe the intrinsic length and time scales

derived from a text-independent background model through adaptation using the
utterances of a particular pass-phrase. During training, pass-phrase specific
target speaker models are derived from the particular PBM using the training
data for the respective target model. While testing, the best PBM is first
selected for the test utterance in the maximum likelihood (ML) sense and the
selected PBM is then used for the log likelihood ratio (LLR) calculation with

is compared to conventional text-independent background model based TD-SV
systems using either Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-universal background model

fresh magnetic flux in the quiet Sun. During its first science flight in 2009,
the balloon-borne observatory Sunrise captured images of the magnetic fields in
the quiet Sun at a high spatial resolution. Using these data we measure the
rate at which the IN features bring magnetic flux to the solar surface. In a
previous paper it was found that the lowest magnetic flux in small-scale
features detected using the Sunrise observations is 9 x 10^14 Mx. This is
nearly an order of magnitude smaller than the smallest fluxes of features
detected in observations from the Hinode satellite. In this paper, we compute
the flux emergence rate (FER) by accounting for such small fluxes, which was
not possible before Sunrise. By tracking the features with fluxes in the range
10^15-10^18 Mx, we measure an FER of 1100 Mx cm^-2 day^-1. The smaller features
with fluxes less than or equal to 10^16 Mx are found to be the dominant
contributors to the solar magnetic flux. The FER found here is an order of
magnitude higher than the rate from Hinode, obtained with a similar feature
tracking technique. A wider comparison with the literature shows, however, that
the exact technique of determining the rate of the appearance of new flux can
lead to results that differ by up to two orders of magnitude, even when applied
to similar data. The causes of this discrepancy are discussed and first
qualitative explanations proposed.

formulation that combines the advantages of existing point and line contact
models in a variationally consistent manner. However, the ABC formulation has
so far only been applied in combination with a special torsion-free beam model,
which yields a very simple and efficient finite element formulation, but which
is restricted to initially straight beams with isotropic cross-sections. In
order to abstain from these restrictions, the current work combines the ABC
formulation with a geometrically exact Kirchhoff-Love beam element formulation
that is capable of treating even the most general cases of slender beam
problems in terms of initial geometry and external loads. While the neglect of
shear deformation that is inherent to this formulation has been shown to
provide considerable numerical advantages in the range of high beam slenderness
ratios, alternative shear-deformable beam models are required for examples with
thick beams. The current contribution additionally proposes a novel
geometrically exact beam element based on the Simo-Reissner theory. Similar to
the torsion-free and the Kirchhoff-Love beam elements, also this Simo-Reissner
element is based on a C1-continuous Hermite interpolation of the beam
centerline, which will allow for smooth contact kinematics. For this Hermitian
Simo-Reissner element, a consistent spatial convergence behavior as well as the
successful avoidance of membrane and shear locking will be demonstrated
numerically. All in all, the combination of the ABC formulation with these
different beam element variants (i.e.~the torsion-free element, the
Kirchhoff-Love element and the Simo-Reissner element) results in a very
flexible and modular simulation framework that allows to choose the optimal

unavoidable part of household, business and global activities. Although using
credit cards provides enormous benefits when used carefully and
responsibly,significant credit and financial damages may be caused by
fraudulent activities. Many techniques have been proposed to confront the
growth in credit card fraud. However, all of these techniques have the same
goal of avoiding the credit card fraud; each one has its own drawbacks,
advantages and characteristics. In this paper, after investigating difficulties
of credit card fraud detection, we seek to review the state of the art in
credit card fraud detection techniques, data sets and evaluation criteria.The
advantages and disadvantages of fraud detection methods are enumerated and
compared.Furthermore, a classification of mentioned techniques into two main
fraud detection approaches, namely, misuses (supervised) and anomaly detection
(unsupervised) is presented. Again, a classification of techniques is proposed
based on capability to process the numerical and categorical data sets.
Different data sets used in literature are then described and grouped into real
and synthesized data and the effective and common attributes are extracted for
further usage.Moreover, evaluation employed criterions in literature are
collected and discussed.Consequently, open issues for credit card fraud
detection are explained as guidelines for new researchers.

for which the boundaries are always taken at (timelike) conformal infinities,
we take the boundaries at either large but finite radial coordinate (far
boundary) or very close to the black hole event horizons (near horizon
boundary). The reason for such choices is that such boundaries are similar to
the conformal infinity of AdS spacetime in that they are all timelike, so that
there may be some hope to define dual systems with ordinary time evolution on
such boundaries. Our results indicate that, in the case of far boundaries, the
leading order contribution to the HEEs come from the background Minkowski
spacetime, however, the next to leading order contribution which arises from
the presence of the black holes is always proportional to the black hole mass,
which constitutes a version of the first law of the HEE for asymptotically flat
spacetimes, and the higher order contributions are always negligibly small. In
the case of near horizon boundaries, the leading order contribution to the HEE
is always proportional to the area of the black hole event horizon, and the
case of extremal RN black hole is distinguished from the cases of non-extremal
black holes in that the minimal surface defining the HEE is completely immersed
inside the boundary up to the second order in the perturbative expansion.

very different evaluation regime known as Visual Psychophysics to study visual
perception. Psychophysics is the quantitative examination of the relationships
between controlled stimuli and the behavioral responses they elicit in
experimental test subjects. Instead of using summary statistics to gauge
performance, psychophysics directs us to construct item-response curves made up
of individual stimulus responses to find perceptual thresholds, thus allowing
one to identify the exact point at which a subject can no longer reliably
recognize the stimulus class. In this article, we introduce a comprehensive
evaluation framework for visual recognition models that is underpinned by this

union of maximal (in the symmetric group) imprimitive groups. The study of
types of permutations that appear inside primitive groups goes back to the
origins of the theory of permutation groups. However, this is another instance
of a situation common in mathematics in which a very natural problem turns out
to be extremely difficult. Fortunately, the enormous progresses of the last few
decades seem to allow a new momentum on the attack to this problem. In this
paper we prove that there are infinite families of primitive groups contained
in the union of imprimitive groups and propose a new hierarchy for primitive
groups based on that fact. In addition to the previous results and hierarchy,
we introduce some algorithms to handle permutations, provide the corresponding
GAP implementation, solve some open problems, and propose a large list of open
problems.

~2-30 x 10^-2 solar masses of material in the extended envelope (depending on

broadly consistent with values derived independently (in other works) from HST

options, and their calibration is computationally challenging since no
closed-form expression is available. Due to the higher flexibility in
comparison to European options, the mathematical model involves additional
constraints, and a variational inequality is obtained. We use the Heston
stochastic volatility model to describe the price of a single stock option. In
order to speed up the calibration process, we apply two model reduction
strategies. Firstly, a reduced basis method (RBM) is used to define a suitable
low-dimensional basis for the numerical approximation of the
parameter-dependent partial differential equation ($\mu$PDE) model. By doing so
the computational complexity for solving the $\mu$PDE is drastically reduced,
and applications of standard minimization algorithms for the calibration are
significantly faster than working with a high-dimensional finite element basis.
Secondly, so-called de-Americanization strategies are applied. Here, the main
idea is to reformulate the calibration problem for American options as a
problem for European options and to exploit closed-form solutions. Both
reduction techniques are systematically compared and tested for both synthetic
and market data sets.

activities. Social media is now an indispensable mode of communication; online
gaming is not only a genuine social activity but also a popular spectator
sport. With support for anonymity and larger audiences, online interaction
shrinks social and geographical barriers. Despite such benefits, social
disparities such as gender inequality persist in online social media. In
particular, online gaming communities have been criticized for persistent
gender disparities and objectification. As gaming evolves into a social
platform, persistence of gender disparity is a pressing question. Yet, there
are few large-scale, systematic studies of gender inequality and
objectification in social gaming platforms. Here we analyze more than one
billion chat messages from Twitch, a social game-streaming platform, to study
how the gender of streamers is associated with the nature of conversation.
Using a combination of computational text analysis methods, we show that
gendered conversation and objectification is prevalent in chats. Female
streamers receive significantly more objectifying comments while male streamers
receive more game-related comments. This difference is more pronounced for
popular streamers. There also exists a large number of users who post only on
female or male streams. Employing a neural vector-space embedding (paragraph
vector) method, we analyze gendered chat messages and create prediction models
that (i) identify the gender of streamers based on messages posted in the
channel and (ii) identify the gender a viewer prefers to watch based on their
chat messages. Our findings suggest that disparities in social game-streaming
platforms is a nuanced phenomenon that involves the gender of streamers as well
as those who produce gendered and game-related conversation.

systems with planets very close to second-order mean motion resonances (MMRs,
with period ratio $1:3$, $3:5$, etc.) We present an analytic study of resonance
capture and its stability for planets migrating in gaseous disks. Resonance
capture requires slow convergent migration of the planets, with sufficiently
large eccentricity damping timescale $T_e$ and small pre-resonance
eccentricities. We quantify these requirements and find that they can be
satisfied for super-Earths under protoplanetary disk conditions. For planets
captured into resonance, an equilibrium state can be reached, in which
eccentricity excitation due to resonant planet-planet interaction balances
eccentricity damping due to planet-disk interaction. We show that this
""captured"" equilibrium can be overstable, leading to partial or permanent
escape of the planets from the resonance. In general, the stability of the
captured state depends on the inner to outer planet mass ratio $q=m_1/m_2$ and
the ratio of the eccentricity damping times. The overstability growth time is
of order $T_e$, but can be much larger for systems close to the stability
threshold. For low-mass planets undergoing type I (non-gap opening) migration,
convergent migration requires $q \lesssim 1$, while the stability of the
capture requires $q\gtrsim 1$. These results suggest that planet pairs stably
captured into second-order MMRs have comparable masses. This is in contrast to
first-order MMRs, where a larger parameter space exists for stable resonance
capture. We confirm and extend our analytical results with $N$-body
simulations, and show that for overstable capture, the escape time from the MMR
can be comparable to the time the planets spend migrating between resonances.

carry important information about the past, present, and future universe. Once
a rare galaxy is identified, studying it more effectively requires a set of
galaxies of similar morphology, allowing generalization and statistical
analysis that cannot be done when $N=1$. Databases generated by digital sky
surveys can contain a very large number of galaxy images, and therefore once a
rare galaxy of interest is identified it is possible that more instances of the
same morphology are also present in the database. However, when a researcher
identifies a certain galaxy of rare morphology in the database, it is virtually
impossible to mine the database manually in the search for galaxies of similar
morphology. Here we propose a computer method that can automatically search
databases of galaxy images and identify galaxies that are morphologically
similar to a certain user-defined query galaxy. That is, the researcher
provides an image of a galaxy of interest, and the pattern recognition system
automatically returns a list of galaxies that are visually similar to the
target galaxy. The algorithm uses a comprehensive set of descriptors, allowing
it to support different types of galaxies, and it is not limited to a finite
set of known morphology. While the list of returned galaxies is neither clean
nor complete, it contains a far higher frequency of galaxies of the morphology
of interest, providing a substantial reduction of the data. Such algorithms can
be integrated into data management systems of autonomous digital sky surveys

galaxies in the database is extremely large. The source code of the method is

proper motion. This leads to distance determinations for individual stars with
an accuracy of 0.3 to a few percent. In addition, the orbits of 6 multiple

cases, near infrared) angular separations. Twelve stellar systems are located
in the dark cloud Lynds 1688, the individual distances for this sample are
highly consistent with one another, and yield a mean parallax for Lynds 1688 of
$\varpi=7.28\pm0.06$ mas, corresponding to a distance $d=137.3\pm1.2$ pc. This
represents an accuracy better than 1%. Three systems for which astrometric

pc farther than the core, but this conclusion needs to be confirmed by
observations (currently being collected) of additional sources in the eastern

abstract NL instructions. To evaluate the exePlan method, an industrial robot
Baxter was instructed by NL to perform three types of industrial tasks {'drill
a hole', 'clean a spot', 'install a screw'}. The experiment results proved that
the exePlan method was effective in generating machine-executable plans from
the end-user's NL instructions. Such a method has the promise to endow a
machine with the ability of NL-instructed task execution.

generated from the first component in order to help discriminate between
different levels of damage. To showcase our approach we use data from UAVs that
were deployed to assess the level of damage in the aftermath of a devastating

labeled by a crowdsourcing effort and the labeling categories consisted of
fine-grained levels of damage to built structures. Since our data set is

detailed constraint on the afterglow parameters for the FRB 131104/Swift
J0644.5-5111 system. We find that for the commonly used microphysics shock
parameters (e.g., $\epsilon_e=0.1$, $\epsilon_B=0.01$ and $p=2.3$), if the
redshift value inferred from the DM value is correct to order of magnitude
(i.e., $z>0.1$), the ambient medium number density should be $\leq
10^{-3}~\rm{cm^{-3}}$, which is the typical value for a compact binary merger
environment but disfavors a massive star origin. Assuming a typical ISM
density, one would require that the redshift of the FRB much smaller than the
value inferred from DM value ($z\ll0.1$), implying a non-cosmological origin of
DM. The constraints are much looser if one adopts smaller $\epsilon_B$ and
$\epsilon_e$ values, as observed in some GRB afterglows. The FRB 131104/Swift

networks with linear and discrete-time dynamics and analyze the role of network
structure in TVCS. First, we show that TVCS can significantly enhance network
controllability over TICS, especially when applied to large networks. Through
the analysis of a scale-dependent notion of nodal centrality, we then show that
optimal TVCS involves the actuation of the most central nodes at appropriate
spatial scales at all times. Consequently, it is the scale-heterogeneity of the
central-nodes in a network that determine whether, and to what extent, TVCS
outperforms conventional policies based on TICS. Here, scale-heterogeneity of a
network refers to how diverse the central nodes of the network are at different
spatial (local vs. global) scales. Several analytical results and case studies
support and illustrate this relationship.

However, many double-barred (S2B) galaxies exhibit distinct $\sigma$ peaks on
the minor axis of inner bars, which we termed ""$\sigma$-humps,"" while two local
$\sigma$ minima are present close to the ends of inner bars, i.e.,
""$\sigma$-hollows."" Analysis of numerical simulations shows that
$\sigma_z$-humps or hollows should play an important role in generating the
observed $\sigma$-humps+hollows in low-inclination galaxies. In order to
systematically investigate the properties of $\sigma_z$ in barred galaxies, we
apply the vertical Jeans equation to a group of well-designed three-dimensional
bar+disk(+bulge) models. A vertically thin bar can lower $\sigma_z$ along the
bar and enhance it perpendicular to the bar, thus generating
$\sigma_z$-humps+hollows. Such a result suggests that $\sigma_z$-humps+hollows
can be generated by the purely dynamical response of stars in the presence of
a, sufficiently massive, vertically thin bar, even without an outer bar. Using
self-consistent $N$-body simulations, we verify the existence of vertically
thin bars in the nuclear-barred and S2B models which generate prominent
$\sigma$-humps+hollows. Thus the ubiquitous presence of $\sigma$-humps+hollows
in S2Bs implies that inner bars are vertically thin. The addition of a bulge
makes the $\sigma_z$-humps more ambiguous and thus tends to somewhat hide the
$\sigma_z$-humps+hollows. We show that $\sigma_z$ may be used as a kinematic
diagnostic of stellar components that have different thickness, providing a
direct perspective on the morphology and thickness of nearly face-on bars and

temperature/external magnetic field-driven evolution of magnetization.
  Due to nonconvex anisotropy energy describing magnetic properties of a body,
magnetization can develop fast spatial oscillations creating complicated
microstructures. These microstructures are encoded in Young measures, their
first moments then identify macroscopic magnetization. Our model assumes that
changes of magnetization can contribute to dissipation and, consequently, to
variations of the body temperature affecting the length of magnetization
vectors. In the ferromagnetic state, minima of the anisotropic energy density
depend on temperature and they tend to zero as we approach the so-called Curie
temperature. This brings the specimen to a paramagnetic state. Such a
thermo-magnetic model is fully discretized and tested on two-dimensional
examples. Computational results qualitatively agree with experimental
observations. The own MATLAB code used in our simulations is available for

the key-value memory slots in the memory addressing schema. Exploiting this

dissociation of particles in clusters. Cluster dynamics with cluster-cluster

as novel experimental data is now available, but their interpretation remains
challenging.} We derive here probability distribution functions for clusters
that can either aggregate upon binding to form clusters of arbitrary sizes or a
single cluster can dissociate into two sub-clusters. Using combinatorics
properties and Markov chain representation, we compute steady-state
distributions and moments for the number of particles per cluster in the case
where the coagulation and fragmentation rates follow a detailed balance
condition. We obtain explicit and asymptotic formulas for the cluster size and
the number of clusters in terms of hypergeometric functions. To further
characterize clustering, we introduce and discuss two mean times: one is time
two particles spend together before they separate and other is the time they
spend separated before they meet again for the first time. Finally we discuss
applications of the present stochastic coagulation-fragmentation framework in
cell biology.

family of weighted axis-parallel rectangles in the plane, find a maximum-weight

the approximation and in the parameterized setting. The best known
polynomial-time approximation algorithms achieve super-constant approximation
ratios [Chalermsook and Chuzhoy, SODA 2009; Chan and Har-Peled, Discrete &
Comp. Geometry 2012], even though there is a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation
running in quasi-polynomial time [Adamaszek and Wiese, FOCS 2013; Chuzhoy and
Ene, FOCS 2016]. When parameterized by the target size of the solution, the
problem is $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard even in the unweighted setting [Marx, FOCS
2007].
  To achieve tractability, we study the following shrinking model: one is
allowed to shrink each input rectangle by a multiplicative factor $1-\delta$
for some fixed $\delta>0$, but the performance is still compared against the
optimal solution for the original, non-shrunk instance. We prove that in this
regime, the problem admits an EPTAS with running time $f(\epsilon,\delta)\cdot
n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, and an FPT algorithm with running time $f(k,\delta)\cdot
n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, in the setting where a maximum-weight solution of size at
most $k$ is to be computed. This improves and significantly simplifies a PTAS
given earlier for this problem [Adamaszek et al., APPROX 2015], and provides
the first parameterized results for the shrinking model. Furthermore, we
explore kernelization in the shrinking model, by giving efficient kernelization
procedures for several variants of the problem when the input rectangles are

of a chordal accompaniment (comping). As the improvisation happens
spontaneously, a reference score is non-existent, only a lead sheet. There are
situations, however, when one would like to have the original melody lines in
the form of notated music, see the Real Book. The motivation is either for the
purpose of practice and imitation or for musical analysis. In this work, an
automatic transcriber for jazz guitar solos is developed. It resorts to a very
intuitive representation of tonal music signals: the pitchgram. No
instrument-specific modeling is involved, so the transcriber should be
applicable to other pitched instruments as well. Neither is there the need to
learn any note profiles prior to or during the transcription. Essentially, the
proposed transcriber is a decision tree, thus a classifier, with a depth of 3.
It has a (very) low computational complexity and can be run on-line. The
decision rules can be refined or extended with no or little musical education.
The transcriber's performance is evaluated on a set of ten jazz solo excerpts
and compared with a state-of-the-art transcription system for the guitar plus
PYIN. We achieve an improvement of 34% w.r.t. the reference system and 19%

score, attests that the number of erroneous pitch detections is reduced by more

part of what we term the weak Poynting vector. These results support and
clarify the analysis of Bliokh {\em et al}. The experimental flow lines can be
constructed independently of the number of photons in the beam leading to the
conclusion that flow lines cannot be interpreted as `photon trajectories'. We
discuss exactly how the notion of a photon arises in the field approach in the
light of weak values.

viscous fluid (kinematic viscosity \nu) rotating rapidly (angular velocity
\Omega) inside an axisymmetric cylindrical container (radius L, height H) with
rigid boundaries, that follows the instantaneous small change in the boundary
angular velocity at small Ekman number $E=\nu/H^2\Omega \ll 1$, was provided by
Greenspan & Howard (1963). $E^{1/2}$-Ekman layers form quickly triggering
inertial waves together with the dominant spin-down of the quasi-geostrophic
(QG) interior flow on the $O(E^{-1/2}\Omega^{-1})$ time-scale. On the longer
lateral viscous diffusion time-scale $O(L^2/\nu)$, the QG-flow responds to the
$E^{1/3}$-side-wall shear-layers. In our variant the side-wall and top
boundaries are stress-free; a setup motivated by the study of isolated
atmospheric structures, such as tropical cyclones, or tornadoes. Relative to
the unbounded plane layer case, spin-down is reduced (enhanced) by the presence
of a slippery (rigid) side-wall. This is evinced by the QG-angular velocity,
\omega*, evolution on the O(L^2/\nu) time-scale: Spatially, \omega* increases
(decreases) outwards from the axis for a slippery (rigid) side-wall;
temporally, the long-time ($\gg L^2/\nu)$ behaviour is dominated by an
eigensolution with a decay rate slightly slower (faster) than that for an
unbounded layer. In our slippery side-wall case, the $E^{1/2} \times E^{1/2}$
corner region that forms at the side-wall intersection with the rigid base is
responsible for a $\ln E$ singularity within the $E^{1/3}$-layer causing our
asymptotics to apply only at values of E far smaller than can be reached by our
Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of the entire spin-down process. Instead, we
solve the $E^{1/3}$-boundary-layer equations for given E numerically. Our
hybrid asymptotic-numerical approach yields results in excellent agreement with
our DNS.

is measured by a so-called flux-based Rayleigh number, denoted as ${\rm

this parameter is measured (as opposite to controlled) in dynamos driven by
differential heating, the literature is much less clear concerning its nature
in the case of imposed heat flux. We clarify this issue by highlighting that in
that case, the ${\rm Ra}_{Q}^*$ parameter becomes controlled only in the limit
of large Nusselt numbers (${\rm Nu} \gg 1$).
  We then address the issue of the robustness of the original relation between
$P$ and ${\rm Ra}_Q^*$ with the geometry and the thermal boundary conditions.
We show that in the cartesian geometry, as in the spherical geometry with a
central mass distribution, this relation is purely linear, in both differential
and fixed-flux heating. However, we show that in the geometry commonly studied
by geophysicists (spherical with uniform mass distribution), its validity
places an upper-bound on the strength of the driving which can be envisaged in
a fixed Ekman number simulation. An increase of the Rayleigh number indeed
yields deviations (in terms of absolute correction) from the linear relation
between $P$ and ${\rm Ra}_Q^*$. We conclude that in such configurations, the
parameter range for which $P$ is controlled is limited.

in-medium modification can be extracted using lattice QCD. By combining in a
generalized Gauss-Law the non-perturbative aspects of quark binding with a
perturbative ansatz for the medium effects, we succeed to describe the lattice
values of the potential with a single temperature dependent parameter, in turn
identified with a Debye mass. We find that its behavior, as evaluated in a
recent quenched lattice QCD study, deviates from that in other approaches, such
as hard-thermal-loop perturbation theory or from electric field correlators on
the lattice. In particular around the phase transition its values tend to zero
significantly faster than at weak-coupling.

motivated by the thrust of developing a deeper understanding of recurrent
neural networks, particularly LSTM/GRU-like networks. As the highly complex
structure of the recurrent unit in LSTM and GRU networks makes them difficult
to analyze, our methodology in this research theme is to construct an
alternative recurrent unit that is as simple as possible and yet also captures
the key components of LSTM/GRU recurrent units. Such a unit can then be used
for the study of recurrent networks and its structural simplicity may allow
easier analysis. Towards that goal, we take a system-theoretic perspective to
design a new recurrent unit, which we call the prototypical recurrent unit
(PRU). Not only having minimal complexity, PRU is demonstrated experimentally
to have comparable performance to GRU and LSTM unit. This establishes PRU
networks as a prototype for future study of LSTM/GRU-like recurrent networks.
This paper also studies the memorization abilities of LSTM, GRU and PRU
networks, motivated by the folk belief that such networks possess long-term
memory. For this purpose, we design a simple and controllable task, called
``memorization problem'', where the networks are trained to memorize certain
targeted information. We show that the memorization performance of all three
networks depends on the amount of targeted information, the amount of
``interfering"" information, and the state space dimension of the recurrent
unit. Experiments are also performed for another controllable task, the adding
problem, and similar conclusions are obtained.

the stochastic linear bandit setting. While we obtain a regret bound of order
$\widetilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ as in previous results, the proof sheds new
light on the functioning of the \ts. We leverage on the structure of the
problem to show how the regret is related to the sensitivity (i.e., the
gradient) of the objective function and how selecting optimal arms associated
to \textit{optimistic} parameters does control it. Thus we show that \ts can be
seen as a generic randomized algorithm where the sampling distribution is
designed to have a fixed probability of being optimistic, at the cost of an
additional $\sqrt{d}$ regret factor compared to a UCB-like approach.
Furthermore, we show that our proof can be readily applied to regularized
linear optimization and generalized linear model problems.

a gerby extension of a 9+(1+1) dimensional (i.e. ""doubled"") T-duality

observe that this still extends, via the D0-brane cocycle of its type IIA

  Fields","16 pages, 3 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Schr\""odinger theory of electrons in an external electromagnetic field
can be described from the perspective of the individual electron via the
`Quantal Newtonian' laws (or differential virial theorems). These laws are in
terms of `classical' fields whose sources are quantal expectations of Hermitian
operators taken with respect to the wave function. The laws reveal the
following physics: (a) In addition to the external field, each electron
experiences an internal field whose components are representative of a specific
property of the system such as the correlations due to the Pauli exclusion
principle and Coulomb repulsion, the electron density, kinetic effects, and an
internal magnetic field component. (The response of the electron is described
by the current density field.); (b) The scalar potential energy of an electron
is the work done in a conservative field which is the sum of the internal and
Lorentz fields. It is thus inherently related to the properties of the system.
Its constituent property-related components are hence known. It is a known
functional of the wave function; (c) As such the Hamiltonian is a functional of
the wave function, thereby revealing the intrinsic self-consistent nature of
the Schr\""odinger equation. This then provides a path for the determination of
the exact wave function. (d) With the Schr\""odinger equation written in
self-consistent form, the Hamiltonian now admits via the Lorentz field a new
term that explicitly involves the external magnetic field. The new
understandings are explicated for the stationary state case by application to a
quantum dot in a magnetostatic field in both a ground and excited state. For
the time-dependent case, the same states of the quantum dot in both a
magnetostatic and a time-dependent electric field are considered.

besides a hard-core repulsion, explicitly accounts for the surface tension
induced by the interaction between the particles. Such an equation of state
allows us to go beyond the Van der Waals approximation for any number of
different hard-core radii. A comparison with the Carnahan-Starling equation of
state shows that the new model is valid for packing fractions 0.2-0.22, while
the usual Van der Waals model is inapplicable at packing fractions above
0.1-0.11. Moreover, it is shown that the equation of state with induced surface
tension is softer than the one of hard spheres and remains causal at higher
particle densities. The great advantage of our model is that there are only two
equations to be solved and it does not depend on the various values of the
hard-core radii used for different hadronic resonances. Using this novel
equation of state we obtain a high-quality fit of the ALICE hadron
multiplicities measured at center-of-mass energies of 2.76 TeV per nucleon.
Furthermore, using the traditional hadron-resonance gas model with
multi-component hard-core repulsion and the novel one we investigate the
recently suggested model in which the proper volume of a hadron is proportional
to its mass. We find that the high-temperature maximum of $\chi^2/ndf$ observed
in the latter model always appears in the region located far above the limit of
its applicability.

task. Among many centrality indices, the $k$-shell index performs very well in
finding out influential spreaders. However, the traditional method for
calculating the $k$-shell indices of nodes needs the global topological
information, which limits its applications in large-scale dynamically growing
networks. Recently, L\@\""{u} \emph{et al.} [Nature Communications 7 (2016)
10168] proposed a novel asynchronous algorithm to calculate the $k$-shell
indices, which is suitable to deal with large-scale growing networks. In this
paper, we propose two algorithms to select nodes and update their intermediate
values towards the $k$-shell indices, which can help in accelerating the
convergence of the calculation of $k$-shell indices. The former algorithm takes
into account the degrees of nodes while the latter algorithm prefers to choose
the node whose neighbors' values have been changed recently. We test these two
methods on four real networks and three artificial networks. The results
suggest that the two algorithms can respectively reduce the convergence time up
to 75.4\% and 92.9\% in average, compared with the original asynchronous
updating algorithm.
