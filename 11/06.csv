the spatial sensitivity of wave travel times to perturbations in the solar

convenient framework for numerically solving the forward problem of
time-distance helioseismology in the frequency domain. The fundamental quantity
to be computed is the cross-covariance of the seismic wavefield. We choose
sources of wave excitation that enable us to relate the cross-covariance of the
oscillations to the Green's function in a straightforward manner. We illustrate
the method by considering the 3D acoustic wave equation in an axisymmetric
reference solar model, ignoring the effects of gravity on the waves. The
symmetry of the background model around the rotation axis implies that the
Green's function can be written as a sum of longitudinal Fourier modes, leading
to a set of independent 2D problems. We use a high-order finite-element method
to solve the 2D wave equation in frequency space. The computation is
`embarrassingly parallel', with each frequency and each azimuthal order solved
independently on a computer cluster. We compute travel-time sensitivity kernels
in spherical geometry for flows, sound speed, and density perturbations under
the first Born approximation. Convergence tests show that travel times can be
computed with a numerical precision better than one millisecond, as required by
the most precise travel-time measurements. The method presented here is
computationally efficient and will be used to interpret travel-time
measurements in order to infer, e.g., the large-scale meridional flow in the
solar convection zone. It allows the implementation of (full-waveform)
iterative inversions, whereby the axisymmetric background model is updated at
each iteration.

characterized by a single parameter $\delta$, the total expected drift per

not so well understood. If all cookies are positive then the same threshold for

However, it is unknown if the threshold for transience vs. recurrence extends
to the case when cookies may be negative (even for bounded stacks), and
moreover there are simple counterexamples to show that the threshold for

life. Individual health can be assessed by the Frailty Index (FI). The FI is
calculated simply as the proportion $f$ of accumulated age related deficits
relative to the total, leading to a theoretical maximum of $f \leq 1$.
Observational studies have generally reported a much more stringent bound, with
$f \leq f_{max} <1$. The value of $f_{max}$ in observational studies appears to
be non-universal, but $f_{max} \approx 0.7$ is often reported. A previously
developed network model of individual aging was unable to recover $f_{max}<1$
while retaining the other observed phenomenology of increasing $f$ and
mortality rates with age. We have developed a computationally accelerated
network model that also allows us to tune the scale-free network exponent
$\alpha$. The network exponent $\alpha$ significantly affects the growth of
mortality rates with age. However, we are only able to recover $f_{max}$ by
also introducing a deficit sensitivity parameter $1-q$, which is equivalent to
a false-negative rate $q$. Our value of $q=0.3$ is comparable to finite
sensitivities of age-related deficits with respect to mortality that are often
reported in the literature. In light of non-zero $q$, we use mutual information
$I$ to provide a non-parametric measure of the predictive value of the FI with
respect to individual mortality. We find that $I$ is only modestly degraded by
$q<1$, and this degradation is mitigated when increasing number of deficits are
included in the FI. We also find that the information spectrum, i.e. the mutual
information of individual deficits vs connectivity, has an approximately
power-law dependence that depends on the network exponent $\alpha$. Mutual
information $I$ is therefore a useful tool for characterizing the network

photometrical data acquired by the Kepler Mission. The light curve of the
system, the sinusoidal variation out-of-eclipses and instant-short term flare
events in the entire light curves were analyzed. The temperature of the
secondary component was found to be 3891+-1 K, while the mass ratio of the
components (q) was found to be 0.69+-0.01, and the orbital inclination (i) was
computed as 77.4+-0.1 degrees. The sinusoidal variation is caused by the
stellar spots of two active regions separated by about 180 degrees
longitudinally located around the latitudes of +47 and +30 degrees. In
addition, 94 flares were detected and their parameters were computed. The OPEA
model was derived for these flares and its parameters were computed. The
Plateau value as saturation level for the active component was found to be
1.951+-0.069 s, while the half-life value was found to be 1014 s. The flare
frequency N1 was found to be 0.01351 per hour, while the flare frequency N2 was
found to be 0.00006. Maximum flare rise time (Tr) was found to be 1118.098 s,
while maximum flare total time (Tt) was found to be 6767.72 s. Comparing its
analogue it is seen that the chromospheric activity level of KIC 9761199, which
is a low-mass close binary system according to the light curve analyses, is an
expected level according to the (B-V) color index of 1.303 mag for the active
component.

uncorrelated onsite disorder. The model realizes an interaction-driven quantum
phase transition between an ergodic and a many-body localized phase (MBL). We
propose a single-particle framework to characterize these phases by the
eigenstates (the natural orbitals) and the eigenvalues (the occupation
spectrum) of the one-particle density matrix (OPDM) in many-body eigenstates.
As a main result, we find that the natural orbitals are localized in the MBL
phase, but delocalized in the ergodic phase. This qualitative change in these
single-particle states is a many-body effect, since without interactions the
single-particle energy eigenstates are all localized. The occupation spectrum
in the ergodic phase is thermal in agreement with the eigenstate thermalization
hypothesis, while in the MBL phase the occupations preserve a discontinuity at
an emergent Fermi edge. This suggests that the MBL eigenstates are weakly
dressed Slater determinants, with the eigenstates of the underlying Anderson
problem as reference states. We discuss the statistical properties of the
natural orbitals and of the occupation spectrum in the two phases and as the
transition is approached. Our results are consistent with the existing picture
of emergent integrability and localized integrals of motion, or quasiparticles,
in the MBL phase. We emphasize the close analogy of the MBL phase to a
zero-temperature Fermi liquid: in the studied model, the MBL phase is
adiabatically connected to the Anderson insulator and the occupation-spectrum
discontinuity directly indicates the presence of quasiparticles localized in
real space. Finally, we show that the same picture emerges for interacting
fermions in the presence of an experimentally-relevant bichromatic lattice and
thereby demonstrate that our findings are not limited to a specific model.

application software are the central topic of this dissertation. Structuring
techniques provide means to control complexity, the latter being a relevant
factor for the introduction of design faults. This fact and the ever increasing
complexity of today's distributed software justify the need for simple,
coherent, and effective structures for the expression of fault-tolerance in the
application software. A first contribution of this dissertation is the
definition of a base of structural attributes with which application-level
fault-tolerance structures can be qualitatively assessed and compared with each
other and with respect to the above mentioned need. This result is then used to
provide an elaborated survey of the state-of-the-art of software
fault-tolerance structures. The key contribution of this work is a novel
structuring technique for the expression of the fault-tolerance design concerns
in the application layer of those distributed software systems that are
characterized by soft real-time requirements and with a number of processing
nodes known at compile-time. The main thesis of this dissertation is that this
new structuring technique is capable of exhibiting satisfactory values of the
structural attributes in the domain of soft real-time, distributed and parallel
applications. Following this novel approach, beside the conventional
programming language addressing the functional design concerns, a
special-purpose linguistic structure (the so-called ""recovery language"") is
available to address error recovery and reconfiguration. This recovery language
comes into play as soon as an error is detected by an underlying error
detection layer, or when some erroneous condition is signaled by the
application processes.

Taking advantage of the small initial longitudinal emittance, a downstream
velocity bunching cavity is used to compress the beam to $<10$ fs rms bunch
length. The measurement is performed using a thick high voltage deflecting
cavity which is shown to be well-suited to measure ultrashort durations of
bunching beams, provided that the beam reaches a ballistic longitudinal focus
at the cavity center.

language model designed to directly capture the global semantic meaning
relating words in a document via latent topics. Because of their sequential
nature, RNNs are good at capturing the local structure of a word sequence -
both semantic and syntactic - but might face difficulty remembering long-range
dependencies. Intuitively, these long-range dependencies are of semantic
nature. In contrast, latent topic models are able to capture the global
underlying semantic structure of a document but do not account for word
ordering. The proposed TopicRNN model integrates the merits of RNNs and latent
topic models: it captures local (syntactic) dependencies using an RNN and
global (semantic) dependencies using latent topics. Unlike previous work on
contextual RNN language modeling, our model is learned end-to-end. Empirical
results on word prediction show that TopicRNN outperforms existing contextual
RNN baselines. In addition, TopicRNN can be used as an unsupervised feature
extractor for documents. We do this for sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie
review dataset and report an error rate of $6.28\%$. This is comparable to the
state-of-the-art $5.91\%$ resulting from a semi-supervised approach. Finally,
TopicRNN also yields sensible topics, making it a useful alternative to
document models such as latent Dirichlet allocation.

borophenes. In this work, we explore the stability and hardness of the highest
boride of tungsten, which is regarded as built of borophenes separated by metal
atoms. We show that WB$_{3+x}$ has Vickers hardnesses approaching 40 GPa only
for small values of $x$. The insertion of extra boron atoms is, in general,
detrimental for WB$_{3}$ in terms of hardness since leads to the formation of
quasi-planar boron sheets that are less tightly connected with the adjacent W
layers. Very high concentrations of boron ($x \approx 1$), give rise to a soft
(Vickers hardness of about 8 GPa) and unstable $hP$20-WB$_{4}$ structure that
can be considered as built of quasi-planar boron $\alpha$-sheets separated by
graphitic W layers. On the other hand, we show that the formation of tungsten
vacancies brings on structures, e.g. W$_{0.75}$B$_{3+x}$, with Vickers
hardnesses that are less sensitive to variations in the boron content and are
close in value to the experimentally reported load-independent values above 20

gain control, inspired by those used to model biological neurons. Using a
variant of stochastic gradient descent, we jointly optimize the entire model
for rate-distortion performance over a database of training images, introducing
a continuous proxy for the discontinuous loss function arising from the
quantizer. Under certain conditions, the relaxed loss function may be
interpreted as the log likelihood of a generative model, as implemented by a
variational autoencoder. Unlike these models, however, the compression model
must operate at any given point along the rate-distortion curve, as specified
by a trade-off parameter. Across an independent set of test images, we find
that the optimized method generally exhibits better rate-distortion performance
than the standard JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression methods. More importantly, we
observe a dramatic improvement in visual quality for all images at all bit

also compare the extinction-corrected diagnostics of star formation rate with
the thermal and nonthermal radio tracers and derive the first star formation
calibration relations using the MRC radio luminosity. The nonthermal spectral
index flattens with increasing star formation rate surface density, indicating
the effect of the star formation feedback on the cosmic ray electron population
in galaxies. Comparing the radio and IR SEDs, we find that the FIR-to-MRC ratio
could decrease with star formation rate, due to the amplification of the
magnetic fields in star forming regions. This particularly implies a decrease
in the ratio at high redshifts, where mostly luminous/star forming galaxies are
detected.

$\#$independent-sets of all sizes, is such a problem, and one of the hardest of

  Using these two powerful properties, self reducibility and easy decision, we
prove that all problems/ functions $f$ in this class can be approximated in
probabilistic polynomial time within an absolute exponential error
$\epsilon\cdot 2^{n'}, \forall\epsilon>0$, which for many of those problems
(when $n'=n+$constant) implies additive approximation to the fraction
$f(x)/2^n$. (Where $n'$ is the amount of non-determinism of some associated

  Moreover we show that for all these problems we can have multiplicative error

$2^{2n'/3}poly(n)$, which is strictly smaller than exhaustive search. We also
show that $f(x)<g(x)$ can be decided deterministically in time $g(x)poly(n),

  Finally we show that the Circuit Acceptance Probability Problem, which is
related to derandomization and circuit lower bounds, can be solved with high
probability and in polynomial time, for the family of all circuits for which
the problems of counting either satisfying or unsatisfying assignments belong
to TotP (which is the Karp-closure of self reducible problems with easy

cosmic rays are injected in star forming regions and lose energy propagating
away from their birth place. Due to the star formation feedback, cosmic ray
electron population becomes younger and more energetic. Star formation also
amplifies the turbulent magnetic field inserting a high pressure which is
important in energy balance in the ISM and structure formation in the host

matrices $P$, such that $p_{u,i}=1$ if and only if the $i^{th}$ arc in a cycle
enters vertex $u$, starting and ending at vertex $n+1$. A graph instance ($G$)

of $P$, $\{p_{u,i} ,p_{v,i+1}\}, i=1,n-1$, for each arc $(u,v)$ not in $G$. For
each $\{p_{u,i} ,p_{v,i+1}\}\in E$, the set of $P$ satisfying
$p_{u,i}=p_{v,i+1}=1$ correspond with a set of cycles not in $G$. Accounting
for all arcs not in $G$, $E$ codes precisely the set of cycles not in $G$. A
doubly stochastic-like $\mathcal{O}$($n^4$) formulation of the Hamilton cycle
decision problem is then constructed. Each $\{p_{u,i} ,p_{v,j}\}$ is coded as

with each $\{p_{u,i} ,p_{v,j}\}\in E$ such that for non-Hamiltonian $G$,
integer solutions cannot exist. We recognize non-Hamiltonicity by iteratively
deducing additional $q_{u,i,v,j}$ that can be set zero and expanding $E$ until
the formulation becomes infeasible, in which case we recognize that no integer
solutions exists i.e. $G$ is decided non-Hamiltonian. Over 100 non-Hamiltonian
graphs (10 through 104 vertices) and 2000 randomized 31 vertex non-Hamiltonian
graphs are tested and correctly decided non-Hamiltonian. For Hamiltonian $G$,
the complement of $E$ provides information about covers of matchings, perhaps
useful in searching for cycles. We also present an example where the algorithm
fails to deduce any integral value for any $q_{u,i,v,j}$ i.e. $G$ is undecided.

sedimentary evidence for deltaic deposition. The observed fluvio-lacustrine
deposits suggest that individual lake-forming climates persisted for at least
several thousand years (assuming dilute flow). But the lake watersheds' little
weathered soils indicate a largely dry climate history, with intermittent
runoff events. Here we show that these observational constraints, while
inconsistent with many previously-proposed triggers for lake-forming climates,
are consistent with a methane burst scenario. In this scenario, chaotic
transitions in mean obliquity drive latitudinal shifts in temperature and ice
loading that destabilize methane clathrate. Using numerical simulations, we
find that outgassed methane can build up to atmospheric levels sufficient for
lake forming climates, for past clathrate hydrate stability zone occupancy
fractions >0.04. Such occupancy fractions are consistent with methane
production by water-rock reactions due to hydrothermal circulation on early
Mars. We further estimate that photochemical destruction of atmospheric methane
curtails the duration of individual lake-forming climates to less than a
million years, consistent with observations. We conclude that methane bursts
represent a potential pathway for intermittent excursions to a warm, wet
climate state on early Mars.

Kullback-Leibler divergence between the predicted and ground-truth label
distributions using deep ConvNets. The proposed DLDL (Deep Label Distribution

over-fitting even when the training set is small. Experimental results show

physics, the quantification and application of quantum coherence has been one
of the long-standing central topics in quantum information science. Within the
framework of a resource theory of quantum coherence proposed recently, a
\textit{fiducial basis} should be pre-selected for characterizing the quantum
coherence in specific circumstances, namely, the quantum coherence is a
\textit{basis-dependent} quantity. Therefore, a natural question is raised:
what are the maximum and minimum coherences contained in a certain quantum
state with respect to a generic basis? While the minimum case is trivial, it is
not so intuitive to verify in which basis the quantum coherence is maximal.
Based on the coherence measure of relative entropy, we indicate the particular
basis in which the quantum coherence is maximal for a given state, where the
Fourier matrix (or more generally, \textit{complex Hadamard matrices}) plays a
critical role in determining the basis. Intriguingly, though we can prove that
the basis associated with the Fourier matrix is a stationary point for
optimizing the $l_1$ norm of coherence, numerical simulation shows that it is
not a global optimal choice.

representations derived from learning a very large number of face images. While
the learned features produced by DCNNs can be highly robust to changes in
viewpoint, illumination, and appearance, little is known about the nature of
the face code that emerges at the top level of such networks. We analyzed the
DCNN features produced by two face recognition algorithms. In the first set of
experiments we used the top-level features from the DCNNs as input into linear
classifiers aimed at predicting metadata about the images. The results show
that the DCNN features contain surprisingly accurate information about the yaw
and pitch of a face, and about whether the face came from a still image or a
video frame. In the second set of experiments, we measured the extent to which
individual DCNN features operated in a view-dependent or view-invariant manner.
We found that view-dependent coding was a characteristic of the identities
rather than the DCNN features - with some identities coded consistently in a
view-dependent way and others in a view-independent way. In our third analysis,
we visualized the DCNN feature space for over 24,000 images of 500 identities.
Images in the center of the space were uniformly of low quality (e.g., extreme
views, face occlusion, low resolution). Image quality increased monotonically
as a function of distance from the origin. This result suggests that image
quality information is available in the DCNN features, such that consistently
average feature values reflect coding failures that reliably indicate poor or
unusable images. Combined, the results offer insight into the coding mechanisms
that support robust representation of faces in DCNNs.

challenges is difficult for at least two reasons: (i) the effects on the

modern libraries increase, so is the number of cases the analysis must handle.
  In this paper we present a new, automated approach for creating static
analyzers: instead of manually providing the various inference rules of the
analyzer, the key idea is to learn these rules from a dataset of programs. Our
method consists of two ingredients: (i) a synthesis algorithm capable of
learning a candidate analyzer from a given dataset, and (ii) a counter-example
guided learning procedure which generates new programs beyond those in the
initial dataset, critical for discovering corner cases and ensuring the learned
analysis generalizes to unseen programs.
  We implemented and instantiated our approach to the task of learning
JavaScript static analysis rules for a subset of points-to analysis and for
allocation sites analysis. These are challenging yet important problems that
have received significant research attention. We show that our approach is
effective: our system automatically discovered practical and useful inference
rules for many cases that are tricky to manually identify and are missed by

intergalactic opacity of $0.01\,\mathrm{mag}\,h\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{-1}$ at the
local Universe have a significant impact on the EBL because obscuration of
galaxies and density of intergalactic dust increase with redshift as
$\left(1+z\right)^3$. Consequently, intergalactic opacity increases and the
Universe becomes considerably opaque at $z > 3$. Adopting realistic values for
galactic and intergalactic opacity, the estimates of the EBL for the expanding
dusty universe are close to observations. The luminosity density evolution fits
well measurements. The model reproduces a steep increase of the luminosity
density at $z<2$, its maximum at $z=2-3$, and its decrease at higher redshifts.
The increase of the luminosity density at low $z$ is not produced by the
evolution of the star formation rate but by the fact that the Universe occupied
a smaller volume in previous epochs. The decline of the luminosity density at
high $z$ originates in the opacity of the Universe. The calculated bolometric
EBL ranges from 100 to 200 $\mathrm{n W m}^{-2}\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$ and is within
the limits of 40 and 200 $\mathrm{n W m}^{-2}\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$ of current EBL

behavior of mass-disorder scattering in this system can only be understood from
a combination of the nature of the phonon modes and the magnitude of the mass
variance. Mass-disorder scattering is not effective at scattering acoustic
phonons of low energy. By using a simple model of grain boundary scattering, we
find that nanostructuring these compounds can scatter such phonons effectively

range. Experimental and RPMD results are in very good agreement when
contributions from both PESs to this chemical reaction are included in the RPMD
simulations. The deviation between experiment and the RPMD calculations does
not exceed 25 % and both results exhibit a slight negative temperature
dependence. The first excited 1A"" PES plays a more important role than the
ground 1A' PES as the temperature is decreased, similar to our previous studies
of the C(1D) + H2 reaction but with a more pronounced effect. The small
differences in temperature dependence between the earlier and present
experimental studies of C(1D) + H2/D2 reactions are discussed in terms of the
use of non-equilibrium populations of ortho/para-H2/D2. We argue that RPMD
provides a very convenient and reliable tool to study low-temperature chemical
reactions.

assessment of stability boundaries. It has been recently realized that the
stability conditions for such microgrids are significantly different from those
known for large- scale power systems. While detailed models are available, they
are both computationally expensive and can not provide the insight into the
instability mechanisms and factors. In this paper, a computationally efficient
and accurate reduced-order model is proposed for modeling the inverter-based
microgrids. The main factors affecting microgrid stability are analyzed using
the developed reduced-order model and are shown to be unique for the
microgrid-based network, which has no direct analogy to large-scale power
systems. Particularly, it has been discovered that the stability limits for the
conventional droop-based system (omega - P/V - Q) are determined by the ratio
of inverter rating to network capacity, leading to a smaller stability region
for microgrids with shorter lines. The theoretical derivation has been provided
to verify the above investigation based on both the simplified and generalized
network configurations. More impor- tantly, the proposed reduced-order model
not only maintains the modeling accuracy but also enhances the computation
efficiency. Finally, the results are verified with the detailed model via both

Most structures can serve as the anisotropic zero-index metamaterials for the

demonstrated for both the longitudinal and transverse waves. Moreover, with the
particular constraints in optimization, we design a super-anisotropic
metamaterial exhibiting the double-negative and hyperbolic dispersions along
two principal directions, respectively. Our optimization work provides a robust

(Our sheet can slip along the sphere; the bonding controls only its normal
displacement.) If the bonding is stiff (but not too stiff), the geometry of the
sphere makes the sheet wrinkle to avoid azimuthal compression. The total energy
of this system is the elastic energy of the sheet plus a (Winkler-type)
substrate energy. Treating the thickness of the sheet $h$ as a small parameter,
we determine the leading-order behavior of the energy as $h$ tends to zero, and
give (almost matching) upper and lower bounds for the next-order correction.
Our analysis of the leading-order behavior determines the macroscopic
deformation of the sheet; in particular it determines the extent of the
wrinkled region, and predicts the (nontrivial) radial strain of the sheet. The
leading-order behavior also provides insight about the length scale of the
wrinkling, showing that it must be approximately independent of the distance
$r$ from the center of the sheet (so that the number of wrinkles must increase
with $r$). Our results on the next-order correction provide insight about how
the wrinkling pattern should vary with $r$. Roughly speaking, they suggest that
the length scale of wrinkling should {\it not} be exactly constant -- rather,
it should vary a bit, so that the number of wrinkles at radius $r$ can be
approximately piecewise constant in its dependence on $r$, taking values that
are integer multiples of $h^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx 1/2$.

define the so-called punctured combinatorial \v{C}ech-Picard complex, whose
first cohomology computes $\mathrm{Pic}^{\mathrm{loc}}(M)$, the local Picard
group of a binoid. We look then at simplicial binoids, whose spectrum presents
very nice combinatorial properties. We prove that the cohomology of a constant
sheaf on this punctutured spectra can be computed entirely in terms of
simplicial cohomology. Through some other results, we prove that we can compute
cohomology of the sheaf of units (and thus the local Picard group) by meaning
of reduced simplicial cohomology. We move from combinatorics to algebra and we
try to use these tools to understand binoid algebras and cohomology of their
sheaf of units. We introduce a new topology, that we call combinatorial
topology on $\mathrm{Spec}\mathbb{K}[M]$. In this topology, if $M$ is a
reduced, torsion-free and cancellative binoid, we can decompose the sheaf of
units of its algebra in a direct sum of a constant part $\mathbb{K}^*$ and of
the pushforward of the combinatorial units. We specialize to the case of the
Stanley-Reisner rings, for which we are able to prove a vanishing result for
the affine case. By meaning of the combinatorial topology we then prove that we
can compute the Zariski cohomology of the sheaf of units entirely in terms of

modulator) usually rely on calibrated broadband photo-detectors or complicated
RF mixdown operations. As the bandwidths of these devices continue to increase,
there is a growing need for a characterization method that does not have

demonstrate a new calibration technique on an optical system (consisting of an
optical cavity and a high-speed waveguide modulator) that is free from
limitations imposed by detector bandwidth, and does not require a calibrated
photo-detector or modulator. We use a low-frequency (DC) photo-detector to
monitor the cavity's optical response as a function of modulation frequency,
which is also used to determine the modulator's frequency response. Knowledge
of the frequency-dependent modulation depth allows us to more precisely
determine the cavity's characteristics (free spectral range and linewidth). The
precision and repeatability of our technique is demonstrated by measuring the
different resonant frequencies of orthogonal polarization cavity modes caused
by the presence of a non-linear crystal. Once the modulator has been

determine the velocity of the swimmer analytically, starting from the forces
driving the motion and assuming that the oscillations in the effective radii of
the beads are known and are much smaller than the radii themselves. We find
that to the lowest order, only the driving frequency mode of the surface
oscillations contributes to the swimming velocity, and that this velocity may
both rise and fall with the deformability of the beads depending on the spring
constant. To test these results, we run immersed boundary lattice Boltzmann
simulations of the swimmer, and show that they reproduce both the

the methods, architectures, and tools that allow to express a fault-tolerant
system in the application software of our computers. Application-level
fault-tolerance is a sub-class of software fault-tolerance that focuses on the
problems of expressing the problems and solutions of fault-tolerance in the top
layer of the hierarchy of virtual machines that constitutes our computers. This
book shows that application-level fault-tolerance is a key ingredient to craft
truly dependable computer systems--other approaches, such as hardware
fault-tolerance, operating system fault-tolerance, or fault-tolerant
middleware, are also important ingredients to achieve resiliency, but they are
not enough. Failing to address the application layer means leaving a backdoor
open to problems such as design faults, interaction faults, or malicious
attacks, whose consequences on the quality of service could be as unfortunate
as, e.g., a physical fault affecting the system platform. In other words, in
most cases it is simply not possible to achieve complete coverage against a
given set of faults or erroneous conditions without embedding fault-tolerance
provisions also in the application layer.

family of conductance distributions W(g), defined by simple differential
equations, which are in the one-to-one correspondence with conductance
distributions for quasi-one-dimensional systems of size L^{d-1}\times L_z,
characterizing by parameters L/\xi and L_z/L (\xi is the correlation length, d
is the dimension of space). This family contains the Gaussian and log-normal
distributions, typical for the metallic and localized phases. For a certain
choice of parameters, we reproduce the results for the cumulants of conductance
in the space dimension d=2+\epsilon obtained in the framework of the
\sigma-model approach. The universal property of distributions is existence of
two asymptotic regimes, log-normal for small g and exponential for large g. In
the metallic phase they refer to remote tails, in the critical region they
determine practically all distribution, in the localized phase the former
asymptotics forces out the latter. A singularity at g=1, discovered in
numerical experiments, is admissible in the framework of their calculational
scheme, but related with a deficient definition of conductance. Apart of this
singularity, the critical distribution for d=3 is well described by the present
theory. One-parameter scaling for the whole distribution takes place under
condition, that two independent parameters characterizing this distribution are
functions of the ratio L/\xi.

of the S=1 Weinberg theory. The basis for this construction is the concept of
the Weinberg field as a system of four field functions differing by parity and
by dual transformations. Next, we analyze the recent controversy in the
definitions of the Feynman-Dyson propagator for the field operator containing
the S=1/2 self/anti-self charge conjugate states in the papers by D. Ahluwalia
et al. and by W. Rodrigues Jr. et al. The solution of this mathematical
controversy is obvious. It is related to the necessary doubling of the Fock
Space (as in the Barut and Ziino works), thus extending the corresponding
Clifford Algebra. However, the logical interrelations of different mathematical
foundations with the physical interpretations are not so obvious. Physics
should choose only one correct formalism, it is not clear, why two correct
mathematical formalisms (which are based on the same postulates) lead to
different physical results?

longitudinally magnetized composite gyroelectromagnetic medium are studied. The
composite medium is considered to be constructed by juxtaposition together of
magnetic and semiconductor layers providing all characteristic dimensions of
the resulting multilayered system are much smaller than the wavelength in the
corresponding part of the composite medium. The waveguide dispersion equation
and its eigenmodes are derived. The mode classification is made in a standard
manner so that the guided modes are sorted into a class of hybrid HE and EH
waves in terms of their unique dispersion characteristics. The numerical
results are obtained in the band near the frequencies of corresponding
resonances in constitutive materials of the composite medium, and they show
that the modes behaviors become to be quite diverse due to manifestation of a
strong combined geometrical and material dispersion related to the waveguide
parameters and gyroelectromagnetic filling, respectively.

profile $\rho(r)=\frac{c^2}{8\pi G r^2} $. This configuration satisfies the

We refer it as ""Planckonion"". The interesting thing about the Plankonion is
that it has an onion like structure. The central sphere with radius of the
Plank-lenght $ L_p=\sqrt{(\frac {2\hbar G}{c^3})}$ has one unit of the
Planck-mass $M_p=\sqrt {(\frac {c\hbar}{2G})}$. Subsequent spherical shells of
radial width $L_p$ contain exactly one unit of $M_p$. We study this stellar
configuration using Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and show that the
equation is satisfied if pressure $P(r)=-\rho(r)$. On the geometrical side, the
space component of the metric blows up at every point. The time component of
the metric is zero inside the star but only in the sense of a distribution
(generalized function). The Planckonions mimic some features of black holes but
avoid appearance of central singularity because of the violation of null energy
conditions.

$\kappa$ that describes the determinism rate of the analyzed time series. We
find that the underlying system for futures prices shows a reliability level
