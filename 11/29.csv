crucial need for a team when it looks to improve its chances of winning a match
or to understand its performances. State of the art tracking systems now
produce spatio-temporal traces of player trajectories with high definition and
frequency that has facilitated a variety of research efforts to extract insight
from the trajectories. Despite many methods borrowed from different disciplines
(machine learning, network and complex systems, GIS, computer vision,
statistics) has been proposed to answer to the needs of teams, a friendly and
easy-to-use approach to visualize spatio-temporal movements is still missing.
This paper suggests the use of gvisMotionChart function in GoogleVis R package.
I present and discuss results of a basketball case study. Data refers to a
match played by an italian team militant in ""C-gold"" league on March 22nd,
2016. With this case study I show that such a visualization approach could be
useful in supporting researcher on preliminar stages of their analysis on
sports' movements, and to facilitate the interpretation of their results.

resource-constrained quantum systems with pure states and a finite dimensional

functionals on $SU(N)$. We show that when the action functional is
bi-invariant, the minimum time for implementing any quantum gate using a

a constant Hamiltonian, thus constant Hamiltonians are time optimal for these

for self-referencing to detect the carrier-envelope offset frequency. However,
stably accessing such states is complicated by thermo-optic dispersion. For
example, in the Si3N4 platform, precisely dispersion-engineered structures can
support broadband operation, but microsecond thermal time constants have
necessitated fast pump power or frequency control to stabilize the solitons. In
contrast, here we consider how broadband soliton states can be accessed with
simple pump laser frequency tuning, at a rate much slower than the thermal
dynamics. We demonstrate octave-spanning soliton frequency combs in Si3N4
microresonators, including the generation of a multi-soliton state with a pump
power near 40 mW and a single-soliton state with a pump power near 120 mW. We
also develop a simplified two-step analysis to explain how these states are
accessed in a thermally stable way without fast control of the pump laser, and
outline the required thermal properties for such operation. Our model agrees
with experimental results as well as numerical simulations based on a
Lugiato-Lefever equation that incorporates thermo-optic dispersion. Moreover,
it also explains an experimental observation that a member of an adjacent mode
family on the red-detuned side of the pump mode can mitigate the thermal

statistically studied quiescent and star-forming galaxies using the template
information encoded in the PDFs. The LF covariance matrix in
redshift-magnitude-galaxy type space was computed, including the cosmic

measurements in the 48 ALHAMBRA sub-fields. The uncertainty due to the
photometric redshift prior is also included in our analysis. We modelled the LF
with a redshift-dependent Schechter function affected by the same selection
effects than the data. The measured ALHAMBRA LF at $0.2\leq z<1$ and the
evolving Schechter parameters both for quiescent and star-forming galaxies
agree with previous results in the literature. The estimated redshift evolution
of $M_B^* \propto Qz$ is $Q_{\rm SF}=-1.03\pm0.08$ and $Q_{\rm

population of faint quiescent galaxies, modelled by a second Schechter function
with slope $\beta=-1.31\pm0.11$. We find a factor $2.55\pm0.14$ decrease in the
luminosity density $j_B$ of star-forming galaxies, and a factor $1.25\pm0.16$
increase in the $j_B$ of quiescent ones since $z=1$, confirming the continuous
build-up of the quiescent population with cosmic time. The contribution of the
faint quiescent population to $j_B$ increases from 3% at $z=1$ to 6% at $z=0$.

explicitly show in which small region of parameter space this is possible, and

parameter, $\Lambda$, for a hydrogen atom evaluated at the planetary mass,
radius, and equilibrium temperature. Values of $\Lambda\lesssim20$ suggest
extremely high mass-loss rates. We identify 27 planets (out of 167) that are
simultaneously consistent with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and are expected
to exhibit extreme mass-loss rates. We further estimate the mass-loss rates
($L_{\rm hy}$) of these planets with tailored atmospheric hydrodynamic models.
We compare $L_{\rm hy}$ to the energy-limited (maximum-possible high-energy
driven) mass-loss rates. We confirm that 25 planets (15\% of the sample)
exhibit extremely high mass-loss rates ($L_{\rm hy}>0.1\,M_{\oplus}{\rm
Gyr}^{-1}$), well in excess of the energy-limited mass-loss rates. This
constitutes a contradiction, since the hydrogen envelopes cannot be retained
given the high mass-loss rates. We hypothesize that these planets are not truly
under such high mass-loss rates. Instead, either hydrodynamic models
overestimate the mass-loss rates, transit-timing-variation measurements
underestimate the planetary masses, optical transit observations overestimate
the planetary radii (due to high-altitude clouds), or Neptunes have
consistently higher albedos than Jupiter planets. We conclude that at least one
of these established estimations/techniques is consistently producing biased
values for Neptune planets. Such an important fraction of exoplanets with
misinterpreted parameters can significantly bias our view of populations

X-ray, and Eddington-ratio thresholds, confirming that dual activity from
supermassive black holes (BHs) is generally higher at late pericentric
passages, before a merger remnant has formed, especially at high luminosities.
For typical minor and major mergers, dual activity lasts ~20-70 and ~100-160
Myr, respectively. We also explore the effects of X-ray obscuration from gas,
finding that the dual-AGN time decreases at most by a factor of ~2, and of
contamination from star formation. Using projected separations and velocity
differences rather than three-dimensional quantities can decrease the dual-AGN
time-scales by up to ~4, and we apply filters which mimic current
observational-resolution limitations. In agreement with observations, we find
that, for a sample of major and minor mergers hosting at least one AGN, the
fraction harbouring dual AGN is ~20-30 and ~1-10 per cent, respectively. We
quantify the effects of merger mass ratio (0.1 to 1), geometry (coplanar,
prograde, retrograde, and inclined), disc gas fraction, and BH properties,
finding that the mass ratio is the most important factor, with the difference
between minor and major mergers varying between factors of a few to orders of

determined by the fine structure of the endo-class $\varTheta$ of the simple
character contained in $\pi$, in the sense of Bushnell-Kutzko. The connection
is made via the {\it Herbrand function} $\Psi_\varTheta$ of $\varTheta$. In
this paper, we concentrate on the fundamental Carayol case in which $\sigma$ is
totally wildly ramified with Swan exponent not divisible by $p$. We show that,
for such $\sigma$, the associated Herbrand function satisfies a certain

characterizes this class of representations. We calculate $\Psi_\varTheta$
explicitly, in terms of a classical Herbrand function coming from the
Bushnell-Kutzko classification of simple characters. We describe exactly the
class of functions arising as Herbrand functions $\Psi_\varXi$, as $\varXi$
varies over totally wild endo-classes of Carayol type. In a separate argument,
we get a complete description of $\sigma$ restricted to any ramification
subgroup. This provides a different, more Galois-centred, view on

programming language with a bidirectional effect type system designed from the
ground up around a novel variant of Plotkin and Pretnar's effect handler
abstraction.
  Effect handlers provide an abstraction for modular effectful programming: a
handler acts as an interpreter for a collection of commands whose interfaces
are statically tracked by the type system. However, Frank eliminates the need
for an additional effect handling construct by generalising the basic mechanism
of functional abstraction itself. A function is simply the special case of a
Frank operator that interprets no commands. Moreover, Frank's operators can be
multihandlers which simultaneously interpret commands from several sources at
once, without disturbing the direct style of functional programming with
values.
  Effect typing in Frank employs a novel form of effect polymorphism which
avoid mentioning effect variables in source code. This is achieved by
propagating an ambient ability inwards, rather than accumulating unions of
potential effects outwards.
  We introduce Frank by example, and then give a formal account of the Frank
type system and its semantics. We introduce Core Frank by elaborating Frank
operators into functions, case expressions, and unary handlers, and then give a
sound small-step operational semantics for Core Frank.

n+1)$-MSIS scheme using additive modulo operation for grayscale and colored
images. For checking the effectiveness of proposed scheme; Correlation, MSE and
PSNR techniques are used. The experimental results show that the proposed
scheme is highly secured and altering of noisy images will not reveal any
partial information about secret images. The proposed $(n, n+1)$-MSIS scheme
outperforms the existing MSIS schemes in terms of security.

Schr\""odinger equation (NLSE) with periodic potential and repulsive
nonlinearity. Two classes of the modes are considered: a bound state of a pair
of in-phase and out-of-phase fundamental gap solitons (FGSs) from the first
bandgap separated by various number of empty potential wells. Using the
standard framework of linear stability analysis, we computed the linear spectra
for the gap solitons by means of the Fourier collocation method and the Evans
function method. We found that the gap solitons of the first and second classes
are exponentially unstable for odd and even numbers of separating periods of
the potential, respectively. The real parts of unstable eigenvalues in
corresponding spectra decay with the distance between FGSs exponentially. On
the contrary, we observed that the modes of the first and second classes are
either linearly stable or exhibit weak oscillatory instabilities if the number
of empty potential wells separating FGSs is even and odd, respectively. In both
cases, the oscillatory instabilities arise in some vicinity of upper bandgap
edge. In order to check the linear stability results, we fulfilled numerical
simulations for the time-dependent NLSE by means of a finite-difference scheme.
As a result, all the considered exponentially unstable solutions have been
deformed to long-lived pulsating formations whereas stable solutions conserved
their shapes for a long time.

extensional type theory with guarded recursive types, which are useful for
building models of program logics, and for programming and reasoning with
coinductive types. We wish to implement GDTT with decidable type checking,
while still supporting non-trivial equality proofs that reason about the
extensions of guarded recursive constructions. CTT is a variation of
Martin-L\""of type theory in which the identity type is replaced by abstract
paths between terms. CTT provides a computational interpretation of functional
extensionality, enjoys canonicity for the natural numbers type, and is
conjectured to support decidable type-checking. Our new type theory, guarded
cubical type theory (GCTT), provides a computational interpretation of
extensionality for guarded recursive types. This further expands the
foundations of CTT as a basis for formalisation in mathematics and computer
science. We present examples to demonstrate the expressivity of our type
theory, all of which have been checked using a prototype type-checker
implementation. We show that CTT can be given semantics in presheaves on the
product of the cube category and a small category with an initial object. We
then show that the category of presheaves on the product of the cube category

contamination from a nearby companion star. We modeled the detector systematics
and secondary eclipse spectrum using Gaussian process regression and found that
the near-IR emission spectrum of WASP-103b is featureless across the observed
near-IR region to down to a sensitivity of 175 ppm, and shows a shallow slope
towards the red. The atmosphere has a single brightness temperature of T_B =
2890 K across this wavelength range. This region of the spectrum is
indistinguishable from isothermal, but may not manifest from a physically
isothermal system, i.e. pseudo-isothermal. A Solar-metallicity profile with a
thermal inversion layer at 10^-2 bar fits WASP-103b's spectrum with high
confidence, as do an isothermal profile with Solar metallicity and a
monotonically decreasing atmosphere with C/O>1. The data rule out a
monotonically decreasing atmospheric profile with Solar composition, and we
rule out a low-metallicity decreasing profile as non-physical for this system.
The pseudo-isothermal profile could be explained by a thermal inversion layer
just above the layer probed by our observations, or by clouds or haze in the
upper atmosphere. Transmission spectra at optical wavelengths would allow us to
better differentiate between potential atmospheric models.

computation to study the emergence of quantum speed-up in quantum computer
algorithms.
  Our first contribution is a formalism of restricted quantum operations, named
normalizer circuit formalism, based on algebraic extensions of the qubit
Clifford gates (CNOT, Hadamard and $\pi/4$-phase gates): a normalizer circuit
consists of quantum Fourier transforms (QFTs), automorphism gates and quadratic
phase gates associated to a set $G$, which is either an abelian group or
abelian hypergroup. Though Clifford circuits are efficiently classically
simulable, we show that normalizer circuit models encompass Shor's celebrated
factoring algorithm and the quantum algorithms for abelian Hidden Subgroup
Problems. We develop classical-simulation techniques to characterize under
which scenarios normalizer circuits provide quantum speed-ups. Finally, we
devise new quantum algorithms for finding hidden hyperstructures. The results
offer new insights into the source of quantum speed-ups for several algebraic
problems.
  Our second contribution is an algebraic (group- and hypergroup-theoretic)
framework for describing quantum many-body states and classically simulating
quantum circuits. Our framework extends Gottesman's Pauli Stabilizer Formalism
(PSF), wherein quantum states are written as joint eigenspaces of stabilizer
groups of commuting Pauli operators: while the PSF is valid for qubit/qudit
systems, our formalism can be applied to discrete- and continuous-variable
systems, hybrid settings, and anyonic systems. These results enlarge the known
families of quantum processes that can be efficiently classically simulated.
  This thesis also establishes a precise connection between Shor's quantum
algorithm and the stabilizer formalism, revealing a common mathematical
structure in several quantum speed-ups and error-correcting codes.

the light they emit propagates to an observer, and therefore about the
curvature of the underlying spacetime. Measuring the relationship between the
redshift $z$ and the luminosity distance $D_{\rm L}$ of a standard candle, for
example, yields information on the Universe's matter content. In practice,
however, in order to decode this information the observer needs to make an
assumption about the functional form of the $D_{\rm L}(z)$ relation; in other
words, a cosmological model needs to be assumed. In this work, we use
numerical-relativity simulations, equipped with a new ray-tracing module, to
numerically obtain this relation for a few black-hole--lattice cosmologies and
compare it to the well-known Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker case, as
well as to other relevant cosmologies and to the Empty-Beam Approximation. We
find that the latter provides the best estimate of the luminosity distance and
formulate a simple argument to account for this agreement. We also find that a
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker model can reproduce this observable
exactly, as long as a time-dependent cosmological constant is included in the
fit. Finally, the dependence of these results on the lattice mass-to-spacing
ratio $\mu$ is discussed: we discover that, unlike the expansion rate, the
$D_{\rm L}(z)$ relation in a black-hole lattice does not tend to that measured
in the corresponding continuum spacetime as $\mu \to 0$.

illustrated for Cantor sets consisting of continued fraction expansions with
restricted digits. For example the Hausdorff dimension of the set $E_2$ (of
those reals whose continued fraction expansion only contains digits 1 and 2)
can be rigorously approximated, with an accuracy of over 100 decimal places,
using points of period up to 25.
  The method for establishing rigorous dimension bounds involves the
holomorphic extension of mappings associated to the allowed continued fraction
digits, an appropriate disc which is contracted by these mappings, and an
associated transfer operator acting on the Hilbert Hardy space of analytic
functions on this disc. We introduce methods for rigorously bounding the

the engineer population is modeled by Ricker equation with a density-dependent

configuration problem. Such problems have recently received much interest in
the context of algorithmic graph theory. We initiate the theoretical study of
the following reconfiguration problem: How to reroute $k$ unsplittable flows of
a certain demand in a capacitated network from their current paths to their
respective new paths, in a congestion-free manner? This problem finds immediate
applications, e.g., in traffic engineering in computer networks. We show that
the problem is generally NP-hard already for $k = 2$ flows, which motivates us
to study rerouting on a most basic class of flow graphs, namely DAGs.
Interestingly, we find that for general $k$, deciding whether an unsplittable
multi-commodity flow rerouting schedule exists, is NP-hard even on DAGs. Both
NP-hardness proofs are non-trivial. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time
(fixed parameter tractable) algorithm to solve the route update problem for a
bounded number of flows on DAGs. At the heart of our algorithm lies a novel
decomposition of the flow network that allows us to express and resolve
reconfiguration dependencies among flows.

of $\sigma_{\rm eff}$. We also found out that single parton scatterings were
only dominant at large transverse momenta. We present here the first
phenomenological analysis of another part of the ATLAS data sample, namely of a
$Z^0$ boson plus a {\it non-prompt} $J/\psi$. Our study is performed at
next-to-leading order in $\alpha_s$ and includes parton-shower effects via the
{\sc\small MadGraph5_aMC@NLO} framework. We find out that the data, unlike the
case of prompt $J/\psi+Z^0$, do not hint at significant DPS contributions.
Owing to the current experimental and theoretical uncertainties, there is still
a room for these but with a lower limit of $\sigma_{\rm eff}$ close to 5 mb. We
stress the importance of QCD corrections to account for the ATLAS data.

  Bike-Sharing Systems",,,,,"math.OC cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The growing popularity of bike-sharing systems around the world has motivated
recent attention to models and algorithms for their effective operation. Most
of this literature focuses on their daily operation for managing asymmetric
demand. In this work, we consider the more strategic question of how to
(re-)allocate dock-capacity in such systems. We develop mathematical
formulations for variations of this problem (either for service performance
over the course of one day or for a long-run-average) and exhibit discrete
convex properties in associated optimization problems. This allows us to design
a practically fast polynomial-time allocation algorithm to compute an optimal
solution for this problem, which can also handle practically motivated
constraints, such as a limit on the number of docks moved in the system.
  We apply our algorithm to data sets from Boston, New York City, and Chicago
to investigate how different dock allocations can yield better service in these
systems. Recommendations based on our analysis have led to changes in the
system design in Chicago and New York City. Beyond optimizing for improved
quality of service through better allocations, our results also provide a
metric to compare the impact of strategically reallocating docks and the
rebalancing of bikes.

chromospheric activity, as measured by H$\alpha$ emission, in low-mass members
of the 500-Myr-old open cluster M37. Combining our new measurements of
H$\alpha$ luminosities ($L_{H\alpha}$) with previously cataloged stellar
properties, we identify saturated and unsaturated regimes in the dependence of
the $L_{H\alpha}$-to-bolometric-luminosity ratio, $L_{H\alpha}/L_{bol}$, on the
Rossby number $R_o$. All rotators with Ro smaller than 0.03$\pm$0.01 converge
to an activity level of $L_{H\alpha}/L_{bol}$ = (1.27$\pm$0.02) x 10$^{-4}$.
This saturation threshold ($R_{o,sat}$ = 0.03$\pm$0.01) is statistically
smaller than that found in most studies of the rotation-activity relation. In
the unsaturated regime, slower rotators have lower levels of chromospheric
activity, with $L_{H\alpha}/L_{bol}$($R_o$) following a power-law of index
$\beta$ = -0.51$\pm$0.02, slightly shallower than the one found for a combined
$\approx$650-Myr-old sample of Hyades and Praesepe stars. By comparing this
unsaturated behavior to that previously found for coronal activity in M37 (as
measured via the X-ray luminosity, $L_X$), we confirm that chromospheric
activity decays at a much slower rate than coronal activity with increasing
$R_o$. While a comparison of $L_{H\alpha}$ and $L_X$ for M37 members with
measurements of both reveals a nearly 1:1 relation, removing the
mass-dependencies by comparing instead $L_{H\alpha}/L_{bol}$ and $L_X/L_{bol}$
does not provide clear evidence for such a relation. Finally, we find that
$R_{o,sat}$ is smaller for our chromospheric than for our coronal indicator of
activity ($R_{o,sat}$ = 0.03$\pm$0.01 versus 0.09$\pm$0.01). We interpret this
as possible evidence for coronal stripping.

Dynamics (BD) simulations of colloidal scale particles. The method relies on a
new formulation for Ewald summation of the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) tensor,
which guarantees that the real-space and wave-space contributions to the tensor
are independently symmetric and positive-definite for all possible particle
configurations. Brownian displacements are drawn from a superposition of two
independent samples: a wave-space (far-field or long-ranged) contribution,
computed using techniques from fluctuating hydrodynamics and non-uniform Fast
Fourier Transforms; and a real-space (near-field or short-ranged) correction,
computed using a Krylov subspace method. The combined computational complexity
of drawing these two independent samples scales linearly with the number of
particles. The proposed method circumvents the super-linear scaling exhibited
by all known iterative sampling methods applied directly to the RPY tensor that
results from the power law growth of the condition number of tensor with the
number of particles. Calculations for hard sphere dispersions and colloidal
gels are illustrated and used to explore the role of microstructure on
performance of the algorithm. In practice, the logarithmic part of the
predicted scaling is not observed and the algorithm scales linearly for up to 4
million particles, obtaining speed ups of over an order of magnitude over
existing iterative methods, and making the cost of computing Brownian
displacements comparable the cost of computing deterministic displacements in
BD simulations. A high-performance implementation employing non-uniform fast
Fourier transforms implemented on graphics processing units and integrated with
the software package HOOMD-blue is used for benchmarking.

idea of DenseNets is based on the observation that if each layer is directly
connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion then the network will
be more accurate and easier to train.
  In this paper, we extend DenseNets to deal with the problem of semantic
segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art results on urban scene benchmark

theories can be ""twisted"", in the sense that the gauge flux loops can have
nontrivial braiding statistics among themselves and such twisted gauge theories
are realized in models discovered by Dijkgraaf and Witten. A different
framework to systematically construct three dimensional topological phases was

the answer to this question is Yes, by presenting an explicit construction of
the Walker Wang models which realize both the twisted and untwisted gauge

Improving the ability of deep learning to handle such datasets could have an

that we can first learn or provide a distributed representation for each input
feature (e.g. for each position in the genome where variations are observed),
and then learn (with another neural network called the parameter prediction
network) how to map a feature's distributed representation to the vector of
parameters specific to that feature in the classifier neural network (the

several different but related domains. In this chapter, we propose a single
framework that unifies multi-domain learning (MDL) and the related but better
studied area of multi-task learning (MTL). By exploiting the concept of a
\emph{semantic descriptor} we show how our framework encompasses various
classic and recent MDL/MTL algorithms as special cases with different semantic
descriptor encodings. As a second contribution, we present a higher order
generalisation of this framework, capable of simultaneous
multi-task-multi-domain learning. This generalisation has two mathematically
equivalent views in multi-linear algebra and gated neural networks
respectively. Moreover, by exploiting the semantic descriptor, it provides
neural networks the capability of zero-shot learning (ZSL), where a classifier
is generated for an unseen class without any training data; as well as
zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA), where a model is generated for an unseen
domain without any training data. In practice, this framework provides a
powerful yet easy to implement method that can be flexibly applied to MTL, MDL,
ZSL and ZSDA.

complex phenomena in Nature. However, this complexity has never been defined
nor measured in a quantitative and objective way. In this work we propose a
method to measure the information content of cosmic structure and to quantify
the complexity that emerges from it, based on Information Theory. The emergence
of complex evolutionary patterns is studied with a statistical symbolic
analysis of the datastream produced by state-of-the-art cosmological
simulations of forming galaxy clusters. This powerful approach allows us to
measure how many bits of information are necessary to predict the evolution of
energy fields in a statistical way, and it offers a simple way to quantify
when, where and how the cosmic gas behaves in complex ways. The most complex
behaviors are found in the peripheral regions of galaxy clusters, where
supersonic flows drive shocks and large energy fluctuations over a few tens of
million years. Describing the evolution of magnetic energy requires at least a
twice as large amount of bits than for the other energy fields. When radiative
cooling and feedback from galaxy formation are considered, the cosmic gas is
overall found to double its degree of complexity. In the future, Cosmic
Information Theory can significantly increase our understanding of the
emergence of cosmic structure as it represents an innovative framework to
design and analyze complex simulations of the Universe in a simple, yet
powerful way.

is less affected by nebular line emission contamination and dust attenuation,
is independent of stellar population models, and can be probed up to z~8
through Spitzer/IRAC. Our analysis leverages the unique full depth Spitzer/IRAC
3.6um-to-8.0um data over the CANDELS/GOODS-N, CANDELS/GOODS-S and
COSMOS/UltraVISTA fields. We find that at absolute magnitudes M_z' fainter than
>-23 mag, M_z' linearly correlates with M_UV,1600. At brighter M_z', M_UV,1600
presents a turnover, suggesting that the stellar mass-to-light ratio
Mstar/L_UV,1600 could be characterised by a very broad range of values at high
stellar masses. Median-stacking analysis recovers a Mstar/L_z' roughly
independent on M_z' for M_z'>-23 mag, but exponentially increasing at brighter
magnitudes. We find that the evolution of the LF marginally prefers a pure
evolution in luminosity over a pure evolution in density, with the
characteristic luminosity decreasing by a factor ~5x between z~4 and z~7.
Direct application of the recovered Mstar/L_z' generates stellar mass functions
consistent with average measurements from the literature. Measurements of the
stellar-to-halo mass ratio at fixed cumulative number density show that it is
roughly constant with redshift for Mh>10^12Msun. This is also supported by the
fact that the evolution of the LF at 4<z<7 can be accounted for by a rigid
displacement in luminosity corresponding to the evolution of the halo mass from
abundance matching.

clusters has always drawn attention due to the BHs' potential in a number of
astrophysical phenomena, especially the dynamical formation of binary black
holes (BBH), which would potentially coalesce via radiation of gravitational
waves (GW). This study presents a preliminary set of evolutionary models of
compact stellar clusters with initial masses ranging over
$1.0\times10^4M_\odot-5.0\times10^4M_\odot$, and half-mass radius of 2 pc or 1
pc, that is typical for young massive and starburst clusters. They have
metallicities between $0.05Z_\odot-Z_\odot$. Including contemporary schemes for
stellar wind and remnant-formation, such model clusters are evolved, for the
first time, using the state-of-the-art direct N-body evolution program NBODY7,
until their dissolution or at least for 10 Gyr. That way, a self-regulatory
behaviour in the effects of dynamical interactions among the BHs, especially
while heating and expanding the cluster and self-depleting the BHs, is
demonstrated. The BBH mergers obtained here show a prominence in
triple-mediated mergers while being bound to the clusters, compared to those
occurring among the BBHs that are dynamically ejected from the clusters. This
is in contrast with earlier N-body computations and also with recent
Monte-Carlo method based ones. A broader mass spectrum of BHs and ejection of
BBHs generally of wider orbits and in lower numbers, for the cluster masses
explored here, might cause this which is yet to be fully understood. Among the
BBH coalescences obtained here, there are ones that resemble the detected
GW151226, LVT151012, and GW150914 events and also ones which are even more
massive. A preliminary estimate suggests few 10s - 100s of BBH coalescences per
year, originating due to dynamics in stellar clusters, that can be detected by
the LIGO at its design sensitivity.

densities are relevant for various astrophysical environments, including
molecular clouds (i.e., star-forming regions) and denser, fragmented cores
within these clouds. Our primary goal is to characterize the effects of the
background potential on the subsequent stellar dynamics. We consider the
outcome probabilities as well as the properties of any binaries formed during
the binary-binary encounters, such as the distributions of binary binding
energies and eccentricities. We also present the final velocity distributions
of the ejected single stars. The background potential has two important effects
on the stellar dynamics: 1) The potential acts to reset the zero-point of the
total system energy, which in turn affects the types and properties of the
products of the encounter; 2) For higher $n$ and weakly bound systems (i.e.,
large semimajor axes), the stellar dynamics are significantly affected when
stars become trapped in the potential, oscillating around the system centre of
mass (CM). This, in turn, increases the number of scattering events between
stars (single, binary or triple) near the CM and makes it harder for single
stars to escape to infinity. This ultimately leads to the preferential
ionization of triples and wide binaries and the survival of compact binaries,
with the single stars escaping at very high ejection velocities.

accretion continues and its radius becomes as large as 200 AUs toward the end
of the Class-I phase. A pair of grand-design spiral arms form due to
gravitational instability in the disk, and they transfer angular momentum in
the highly resistive disk. Although the spiral arms disappear in a few
rotations as expected in a classical theory, new spiral arms form recurrently
as the disk soon becomes unstable again by gas accretion. Such recurrent spiral
arms persist throughout the Class-0 and I phase. We then perform synthetic
observations and compare our model with a recent high-resolution observation of
a young stellar object Elias 2-27, whose circumstellar disk has grand design
spiral arms. We find good agreement between our theoretical model and the

2-27 are consistent with material arms formed by gravitational instability. If
such spiral arms commonly exist in young circumstellar disks, it implies that
young circumstellar disks are considerably massive and gravitational

significantly smaller than predicted by the standard model of cosmology. This
discrepancy cannot be simply solved by assuming strong baryonic feedback
processes, since they would violate the observed relation between maximum
circular velocity ($v_{\rm max}$) and baryon mass of galaxies. A speculative
but tantalising possibility is that the mismatch between observation and theory
points towards the existence of non-cold or non-collisionless dark matter (DM).
In this paper, we investigate the effects of warm, mixed (i.e warm plus cold),
and self-interacting DM scenarios on the abundance of dwarf galaxies and the
relation between observed HI line-width and maximum circular velocity. Both
effects have the potential to alleviate the apparent mismatch between the
observed and theoretical abundance of galaxies as a function of $v_{\rm max}$.
For the case of warm and mixed DM, we show that the discrepancy disappears,
even for luke-warm models that evade stringent bounds from the Lyman-$\alpha$
forest. Self-interacting DM scenarios can also provide a solution as long as
they lead to extended ($\gtrsim 1.5$ kpc) dark matter cores in the density
profiles of dwarf galaxies. Only models with velocity-dependent cross sections
can yield such cores without violating other observational constraints at
larger scales.

physically motivated black hole accretion models that directly evolve the

reproduce the coupled disc-jet structure for the emission favored by previous
phenomenological analytic and numerical works. More specifically, we find that
the low frequency radio emission is dominated by emission from a polar outflow
while the emission above 100 GHz is dominated by the inner region of the
accretion disc. The latter produces time variable near infrared (NIR) and X-ray
emission, with frequent flaring events (including IR flares without
corresponding X-ray flares and IR flares with weak X-ray flares). The photon
ring is clearly visible at 230 GHz and 2 microns, which is encouraging for

detailed predictions for their average mass profile from numerical simulations.
However, the intrinsic shape of the profiles can be smeared out when a sample
that spans a wide range of cluster masses is averaged in physical length units.
This effect especially conceals rapid changes in gradient such as the steep
drop associated with the splashback radius, a sharp edge corresponding to the
outermost caustic in accreting halos. We optimize the extraction of such local
features by scaling individual halo profiles to a number of spherical
overdensity radii, and apply this method to 16 X-ray-selected high-mass
clusters targeted in the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble. By
forward-modeling the weak- and strong-lensing data presented by Umetsu et al.,
we show that, regardless of the scaling overdensity, the projected ensemble
density profile is remarkably well described by an NFW or Einasto profile out
to $R \sim 2.5h^{-1}$Mpc, beyond which the profiles flatten. We constrain the
NFW concentration to $c_{200c} = 3.66 \pm 0.11$ at $M_{200c} \simeq 1.0 \times
10^{15}h^{-1}M_\odot$, consistent with and improved from previous work that
used conventionally stacked lensing profiles, and in excellent agreement with
theoretical expectations. Assuming the profile form of Diemer & Kravtsov and
generic priors calibrated from numerical simulations, we place a lower limit on
the splashback radius of the cluster halos, if it exists, of $R_{sp}/r_{200m} >
0.89$ ($R_{sp} > 1.83h^{-1}$Mpc) at 68% confidence. The corresponding density
feature is most pronounced when the cluster profiles are scaled by $r_{200m}$,
and smeared out when scaled to higher overdensities.

correlation functions of scaling operators in the generalised quantum Lifshitz
model are given by a d-dimensional higher-derivative conformal field theory.
Autocorrelation functions in the generalised quantum Lifshitz model in any
number of dimensions can on the other hand be expressed in terms of
autocorrelation functions of a two-dimensional conformal field theory. This
also holds for autocorrelation functions in a strongly coupled Lifshitz field
theory with a holographic dual of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton type. The map to a
two-dimensional conformal field theory extends to autocorrelation functions in
thermal states and out- of-equilbrium states preserving symmetry under spatial
translations and rotations in both types of Lifshitz models. Furthermore, the

hole backgrounds can be obtained analytically at low spatial momenta and

measured evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function; (iii) reasonably
reproduces the observed correlation between galaxy stellar mass and gas
metallicity at different redshifts. These are important prerequisites for
models considering a metallicity dependent efficiency of molecular gas
formation. We also update our model for disk sizes and show that model

stellar and star forming disks at different cosmic epochs. We analyse the
influence of different star formation laws including empirical relations based
on the hydro-static pressure of the disk, analytic models, and prescriptions

star formation law does not affect significantly the global properties of model
galaxies, neither their distributions. The only quantity showing significant
deviations in different models is the cosmic molecular-to-atomic hydrogen

destroyed at the stellar surface. Remnant gas-Neptunes, which are stable to
photo-evaporation, are absent from the observations, despite their unique

for simulating certain classes of modified gravity theories, such as the widely

currently very slow due to the highly nonlinear partial differential equation
that needs to be solved exactly to predict the modified gravitational force.
This nonlinearity is partly inherent, but is also exacerbated by the specific
numerical algorithm used, which employs a variable redefinition to prevent
numerical instabilities. The standard Newton-Gauss-Seidel iterative method used
to tackle this problem has a poor convergence rate. Our new method not only
avoids this, but also allows the discretised equation to be written in a form
that is analytically solvable. We show that this new method greatly improves
the performance and efficiency of $f(R)$ simulations. For example, a test
simulation with $512^3$ particles in a box of size $512 \, \mathrm{Mpc}/h$ is
now 5 times faster than before, while a Millennium-resolution simulation for
$f(R)$ gravity is estimated to be more than 20 times faster than with the old
method. Our new implementation will be particularly useful for running very
high resolution, large-sized simulations which, to date, are only possible for
the standard model, and also makes it feasible to run large numbers of lower
resolution simulations for covariance analyses. We hope that the method will
bring us to a new era for precision cosmological tests of gravity.

computational underpinnings are not well understood. Structure discovery has
previously been formalized as probabilistic inference about the right
structural form --- where form could be a tree, ring, chain, grid, etc. [Kemp &
Tenenbaum (2008). The discovery of structural form. PNAS, 105(3), 10687-10692].
While this approach can learn intuitive organizations, including a tree for
animals and a ring for the color circle, it assumes a strong inductive bias
that considers only these particular forms, and each form is explicitly
provided as initial knowledge. Here we introduce a new computational model of
how organizing structure can be discovered, utilizing a broad hypothesis space
with a preference for sparse connectivity. Given that the inductive bias is
more general, the model's initial knowledge shows little qualitative
resemblance to some of the discoveries it supports. As a consequence, the model
can also learn complex structures for domains that lack intuitive description,
as well as predict human property induction judgments without explicit
structural forms. By allowing form to emerge from sparsity, our approach
clarifies how both the richness and flexibility of human conceptual
organization can coexist.

of inflowing/outflowing gas associated with nearby galaxies and in a cosmic web

strikingly similar to comet comae, suggesting that they have the same
compositions and that the surfaces of the Trojans are highly porous. However, a
direct comparison between a comet and asteroid surface has not been possible
due to the paucity of spectra of comet nuclei at mid-infrared wavelengths. We
present 5-35 {\mu}m thermal emission spectra of comets 10P/Tempel 2, and
49P/Arend-Rigaux observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space

nucleus. We fit each spectrum with the near-Earth asteroid thermal model
(NEATM) and find sizes in agreement with previous values. However, the NEATM
beaming parameters of the nuclei, 0.74 to 0.83, are systematically lower than
the Jupiter-family comet population mean of 1.03+/-0.11, derived from 16- and
22-{\mu}m photometry. When the spectra are normalized by the NEATM model, a
weak 10-{\mu}m silicate plateau is evident, with a shape similar to those seen
in mid-infrared spectra of D-type asteroids. We compare, in detail, these comet
nucleus emission features to those seen in spectra of the Jovian Trojan D-types
(624) Hektor, (911) Agamemnon, and (1172) Aneas, as well as those seen in the
spectra of seven comet comae. The comet comae present silicate features with
two distinct shapes, either trapezoidal, or more rounded. The surfaces of
Tempel 2, Arend-Rigaux, and Hektor best agree with the comae that present
trapezoidal features. An emissivity minimum at 15 {\mu}m, present in the
spectra of Tempel 2, Arend-Rigaux, Hektor, and Agamemnon, is also described,
the origin of which remains unidentified. The compositional similarity between
D-type asteroids and comets is discussed, and our data supports the hypothesis
that they have similar origins in the early Solar System.

performance of our method is demonstrated by extensive experiments and its
application to a Glioblastoma cancer dataset reveals some new insights in
understanding the Glioblastoma cancer. In theory, a non-asymptotic error bound

text-based image retrieval. As users are more likely to describe a scene from a
real world perspective, using 3D spatial relationships rather than 2D
relationships that assume a particular viewing direction, one of the main
challenges is to infer the 3D structure that bridges images with users' text
descriptions. However, direct inference of 3D structure from images requires
learning from large scale annotated data. Since interactions between objects
can be reduced to a limited set of atomic spatial relations in 3D, we study the
possibility of inferring 3D structure from a text description rather than an
image, applying physical relation models to synthesize holistic 3D abstract
object layouts satisfying the spatial constraints present in a textual
description. We present a generic framework for retrieving images from a
textual description of a scene by matching images with these generated abstract
object layouts. Images are ranked by matching object detection outputs
(bounding boxes) to 2D layout candidates (also represented by bounding boxes)
which are obtained by projecting the 3D scenes with sampled camera directions.
We validate our approach using public indoor scene datasets and show that our
method outperforms baselines built upon object occurrence histograms and
learned 2D pairwise relations.

wide variation in appearance within and between categories. Global image
context, such as where the material is or what object it makes up, can be
crucial to recognizing the material. Existing methods, however, operate on an
implicit fusion of materials and context by using large receptive fields as
input (i.e., large image patches). Many recent material recognition methods
treat materials as yet another set of labels like objects. Materials are,
however, fundamentally different from objects as they have no inherent shape or
defined spatial extent. Approaches that ignore this can only take advantage of
limited implicit context as it appears during training. We instead show that
recognizing materials purely from their local appearance and integrating
separately recognized global contextual cues including objects and places leads
to superior dense, per-pixel, material recognition. We achieve this by training
a fully-convolutional material recognition network end-to-end with only
material category supervision. We integrate object and place estimates to this
network from independent CNNs. This approach avoids the necessity of preparing
an impractically-large amount of training data to cover the product space of
materials, objects, and scenes, while fully leveraging contextual cues for
dense material recognition. Furthermore, we perform a detailed analysis of the
effects of context granularity, spatial resolution, and the network level at
which we introduce context. On a recently introduced comprehensive and diverse
material database \cite{Schwartz2016}, we confirm that our method achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly less training data compared to
past methods.

strong evidence of being formed from the collapse of an ONeMg core in an
electron capture supernova (ECSN) or in an ultra-stripped iron core collapse
supernova (FeCCSN). Using three different systematically generated sets of
equations of state we explore the relationship between the moment of inertia of
J0737-3039A and the binding energy of the two low mass neutron stars. We find
this relationship, a less strict variant of the recently discovered I-Love-Q
relations, is nevertheless more robust than a previously explored correlation
between the binding energy and the slope of the nuclear symmetry energy L. We
find that, if either J0737-3039B or the J1756-2251 companion were formed in an
ECSN, no more than 0.06 solar masses could have been lost from the progenitor
core, more than four times the mass loss predicted by current supernova
modeling. A measurement of the moment of inertia of J0737-3039A to within 10%
accuracy from pulsar timing, possible within a decade, can discriminate between
formation scenarios such as ECSN or ultra-stripped FeCCSN and, given current
constraints on the predicted core mass loss, potentially rule them out. Using
the I-Love-Q relations we find that an Advanced LIGO can potentially measure
the neutron star tidal polarizability to equivalent accuracy in a neutron
star-neutron star merger at a distance of 200 Mpc, thus obtaining similar
constraints on the formation scenarios. Such information on the occurrence of
ECSNe is important for population synthesis calculations, especially for
estimating the rate of binary neutron star mergers and resulting
electromagnetic and gravitational wave signals. Further progress needs to be
made modeling the core collapse process that leads to low-mass neutron stars,
particularly in making robust predictions for the mass loss from the progenitor

extends the quantum control landscape assessment, presenting evidence that the

context of regression modeling; if unaccounted for, such misclassification is
known to result in misestimation of model parameters. Here, we exploit the fact
that explicitly modeling covariate misclassification leads to a mixture
representation. Assuming common parametric families for the mixture components,
and assuming that the misclassification occurrence is independent of the
response variable, the mixture representation permits model parameters to be
identified even when misclassification probabilities are unknown. Previous
approaches to covariate misclassification use multiple surrogate covariates
and/or validation data on the magnitude of errors. Based on this mixture
structure, we demonstrate that valid inference can be performed on all the
parameters even when no such additional information is available. Using
Bayesian inference, the method allows for learning from data combined with
external information on the magnitude of errors when such information does
become available. The method is applied to adjust for misclassification on
self-reported cocaine use in the Longitudinal Studies of HIV-Associated Lung
Infections and Complications (Lung HIV). We find a substantial and
statistically significant effect of cocaine use on pulmonary complications
measured by the relative area of emphysema, whereas a regression that does not
adjust for misclassification yields a much smaller estimate.

Specifically, we examine what we call the split-door setting, where the outcome

cause being studied and another that is independent of it, with both parts
sharing the same (unobserved) confounders. We show that under these conditions,
the problem of identification reduces to that of testing for independence among
observed variables, and present a method that uses this approach to
automatically find subsets of the data that are causally identified. We
demonstrate the method by estimating the causal impact of Amazon's recommender
system on traffic to product pages, finding thousands of examples within the
dataset that satisfy the split-door criterion. Unlike past studies based on
natural experiments that were limited to a single product category, our method
applies to a large and representative sample of products viewed on the site. In
line with previous work, we find that the widely-used click-through rate (CTR)
metric overestimates the causal impact of recommender systems; depending on the
product category, we estimate that 50-80\% of the traffic attributed to
recommender systems would have happened even without any recommendations. We
conclude with guidelines for using the split-door criterion as well as a
discussion of other contexts where the method can be applied.

onto stellar remnant black holes. Here we report that a sample of bright
thermal-dominant black hole binaries, which have Eddington ratios constrained
to moderate values, also show broadened disk spectra in the 0.3-10 keV band at
an order of magnitude lower luminosities. This broadening would be missed in
studies that only look above ~2 keV. While this may suggest that broadened disk
ULXs could be powered by accretion onto massive stellar remnant black holes
with close to maximal spin, we argue in favor of a scenario where they are at
close to the Eddington luminosity, such that radiation pressure would be
expected to result in geometrically slim, advective accretion disks. However,
this implies that an additional physical mechanism is required to produce the
observed broad spectra at low Eddington ratios.

(SNe Ia) observations have been used to test the validity of the cosmic
distance duality relation (CDDR), $D_L(z)/[(1+z)^2D_A(z)]=\eta=1$, where
$D_L(z)$ and $D_A(z)$ are the luminosity and the angular diameter distances to
a given redshift $z$, respectively. However, several lensing systems lie in the
interval $1.4 \leq z \leq 3.6$ i.e., beyond the redshift range of current SNe
Ia compilations ($z \approx 1.50$), which prevents this kind of test to be
fully explored. In this paper, we circumvent this problem by testing the CDDR
considering observations of strong gravitational lensing along with SNe Ia and
{ a subsample from} the latest gamma-ray burst distance modulus data, whose
redshift range is $0.033 \leq z \leq 9.3$. { We parameterize their luminosity
distances with a second degree polynomial function and search for possible
deviations from the CDDR validity by using four different $\eta(z)$ functions:
$\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z$, $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z/(1+z)$, $\eta(z)=(1+z)^{\eta_0}$ and
$\eta(z)=1+\eta_0\ln(1+z)$. Unlike previous tests done at redshifts lower than
$1.50$, the likelihood for $\eta_0$ depends strongly on the $\eta(z)$ function
considered, but we find no significant deviation from the CDDR validity
($\eta_0=0$). However, our analyses also point to the fact that caution is
needed when one fits data in higher redshifts to test the CDDR as well as a
better understanding of the mass distribution of lenses also is required for
more accurate results.

performed high-quality photometry, low- and high-resolution spectroscopy, and
spectropolarimetry, finding that SN 2016coj is a spectroscopically normal SN
Ia, but with a high velocity of \ion{Si}{2} $\lambda$6355 ($\sim 12,600$\,\kms\

QED. Specifically, the adsorption of an atom on a vibrating membrane can be
viewed as the counterpart to QED radiative electron capture. A calculation of
the adsorption rate to lowest-order in the atom-phonon coupling is finite;
however, higher-order contributions suffer from an infrared problem mimicking
the case of radiative capture in QED. Terms in the perturbation series for the
adsorption rate diverge as a result of massless particles in the model
(flexural phonons of the membrane in QAD and photons in QED). We treat this
infrared problem in QAD explicitly to obtain finite results by regularizing
with a low-frequency cutoff that corresponds to the inverse size of the
membrane. Using a coherent state basis for the soft phonon final state, we then
sum the dominant contributions to derive a new formula for the multiphonon
adsorption rate of atoms on the membrane that gives results that are finite,
nonperturbative in the atom-phonon coupling, and consistent with the KLN
theorem. For micromembranes, we predict a reduction with increasing membrane
size for the low-energy adsorption rate. We discuss the relevance of this to
the adsorption of a cold gas of atomic hydrogen on suspended graphene.

applications usually employ redundancy in the design to overcome arbitrary
fault(s) or failure(s) and guarantee the correct operation. In this context,
the distributed minority and majority voting based redundancy (DMMR) scheme
forms an efficient alternative to the conventional N-modular redundancy (NMR)
scheme for implementing mission and safety-critical circuits and systems by
significantly minimizing their weight and design cost and also their design
metrics whilst providing a similar degree of fault tolerance. This article
presents the first FPGAs based implementation of example DMMR circuits and
compares it with counterpart NMR circuits on the basis of area occupancy and
critical path delay viz. area-delay product (ADP). The example DMMR circuits
and counterpart NMR circuits are able to accommodate the faulty or failure
states of 2, 3 and 4 function modules. For physical synthesis, two commercial
Xilinx FPGAs viz. Spartan 3E and Virtex 5 corresponding to 90nm and 65nm CMOS
processes, and two radiation-tolerant and military grade Xilinx FPGAs viz. QPro
Virtex 2 and QPro Virtex E corresponding to 150nm and 180nm CMOS processes were
considered for the NMR and DMMR circuit realizations which employ the 4-by-4
array multiplier as a representative function module. To achieve a fault
tolerance of 2 function modules, both the DMMR and the NMR schemes provide near
similar mean ADPs across all the four FPGAs. But while achieving a fault
tolerance of 3 function modules the DMMR features reduced ADP by 44.5% on
average compared to the NMR, and in achieving a fault tolerance of 4 function
modules the DMMR reports reduced ADP by 56.5% on average compared to the NMR
with respect to all the four FPGAs considered.

different shapes. We first discussed the connection between the decrement types

predictions from recently published local line excitation models. One third of
the objects show lines with narrow symmetric profiles, and present similar
Balmer and Paschen decrements (straight decrements, types 2 and A). Lines in
these sources are consistent with optically thin emission from gas with
hydrogen densities of order 10^9 cm^-3 and 5000<T<15000 K. These objects are

be generated by modulating the chemical potential of quantum dots with square

the preparation of entangled states by adiabatic passage is also discussed.
There are two advantages in the scheme by Lyapunov control, i.e., it is
flexible to choose a control Hamiltonian, and the control time is much shorter

extent independent of the detuned photon field when judged from the transport
current. This could be expected in the small bias regime, but an observation of
the occupancy of the states of the system reveals that this picture is not
entirely true. The current does not reflect slower photon-active internal
transitions bringing the system into the steady state. The number of initially
present photons determines when the system reaches the real steady state. With
two-electron states in the bias window we observe a more complex situation with
intermediate radiative and nonradiative relaxation channels leading to a steady

two-electron ground state of the system. The presence of the radiative channels
makes this phenomena dependent on the number of photons initially in the

However, experimental resolution of this scaling is expected to meet formidable
challenges. In this work, we introduce a new thermodynamic quantity, the
three-body contact $C_\theta$, to quantify three-body correlations in a two

$C_\theta$ is the consequence of the underlying universal super Efimov effect
in the many-body context. We show how $C_\theta$ affects physical observables
such as the radio-frequency spectrum, the momentum distribution and the atom

beyond RPA owing to the Pauli principle between the particle-hole pairs that
form the RPA excitations as well as the correlations due to the
particle-particle and hole-hole transitions, whose effects are treated here in
an effective way. By comparing the RPA results with the RRPA ones, which are
obtained for isoscalar (IS) and isovector (IV) dipole excitations in $^{48, 52,
58}$Ca and $^{90, 96, 110}$Zr, it is shown that ground-state correlations
beyond the RPA reduce the IS transition strengths. They also shift up the
energy of the lowest IV dipole state and slightly push down the peak energy of
the IV giant dipole resonance. As the result, the energy-weighted sums of
strengths of both IS and IV modes decrease, causing the violation of the
corresponding energy-weight sum rules (EWSR). It is shown that this sum rule
violation can be eliminated by taking into account the contribution of the
particle-particle and hole-hole excitations together with the particle-hole
ones in a simple and perturbative way. Consequently, the ratio of the
energy-weighted sum of strengths of the pygmy dipole resonance to that of the

the non-relativistic exchange striction mechanism, showing a positive value at
low temperature and a critical behavior toward negative divergence around the
transition temperature. This negative peak value becomes four times larger when
50% of Mn2+ ions are replaced with Fe2+ ion, highlighting the beneficial
perspective of the compositionally-tunable ME effect. As the doped Fe increases

the lowest temperature, which manifests relativistic single-site origin of the

can extend the SN Ia Hubble diagram to very high redshifts $(z\gtrsim 2)$,
probe potential SN Ia evolution, and deliver high-precision constraints on
$H_0$, $w$, and $\Omega_m$ via time delays. However, only one, iPTF16geu, has
been found to date, and many more are needed to achieve these goals. To
increase the multiply imaged SN Ia discovery rate, we present a simple
algorithm for identifying gravitationally lensed SN Ia candidates in cadenced,
wide-field optical imaging surveys. The technique is to look for supernovae
that appear to be hosted by elliptical galaxies, but that have absolute
magnitudes implied by the apparent hosts' photometric redshifts that are far
brighter than the absolute magnitudes of normal SNe Ia (the brightest type of
supernovae found in elliptical galaxies). Importantly, this purely photometric
method does not require the ability to resolve the lensed images for discovery.
AGN, the primary sources of contamination that affect the method, can be
controlled using catalog cross-matches and color cuts. Highly magnified
core-collapse supernovae will also be discovered as a byproduct of the method.
Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we forecast that LSST can discover up to 500
multiply imaged SNe Ia using this technique in a 10-year $z$-band search, more
than an order of magnitude improvement over previous estimates (Oguri &
Marshall 2010). We also predict that ZTF should find up to 10 multiply imaged
SNe Ia using this technique in a 3-year $R$-band search---despite the fact that
this survey will not resolve a single system.

engaging to joint attention. Our key innovation is to use the 3D reconstruction
of multiple first person cameras to automatically annotate each other's the
visual semantics of social configurations.
  We leverage two learning signals uniquely embedded in first person videos.
Individually, a first person video records the visual semantics of a spatial
and social layout around a person that allows associating with past similar
situations. Collectively, first person videos follow joint attention that can
link the individuals to a group. We learn the egocentric visual semantics of
group movements using a Siamese neural network to retrieve future trajectories.
We consolidate the retrieved trajectories from all players by maximizing a
measure of social compatibility---the gaze alignment towards joint attention
predicted by their social formation, where the dynamics of joint attention is
learned by a long-term recurrent convolutional network. This allows us to
characterize which social configuration is more plausible and predict future
group trajectories.

aggregation condition that the separator has the highest capture efficiency. In
the model we adopt the functions that use nominal particle radius and magnetic
mineral content as independent variables to describe volume fraction
distribution and capture efficiency of intergrowths respectively. Through
adding multi-wire magnetic fields and setting periodic boundary conditions in
flow field analysis, we modify the computational domain of the single-wire
capture theory to a element domain that periodically appears in the multi-wire
matrix. By means of finite element software, particle trajectories, flow field

is obtained by interpolation method. The calculated evaluation variables
theoretically represent the best performance of magnetic separator for a given

then an inverse water-filling algorithm is put forward to find the optimal
power allocation for each information symbol, with a stepwise search being used
to adjust the spatial dimension allocated to artificial noise (AN) such that
the target rate is achievable. As for the case of statistical ECSI, several

reproduced quite well even if particle interactions are taken into account to
first order only. Besides approximating gravitational interactions, we had to
truncate the initial correlation hierarchy of particle momenta at the second
order. Here, we substantially simplify KFT. We show that its central object,
the free generating functional, can be factorized, taking the full hierarchy of
momentum correlations into account. The factors appearing in the generating
functional, which we identify as non-linearly evolved density-fluctuation power
spectra, have a universal form and can thus be tabulated for fast access in
perturbation schemes.
  In this paper, we focus on a complete evaluation of the free generating
functional of KFT, not including particle interactions yet. This implies that
the non-linearly evolved power spectra contain a damping term which reflects
that structures are being wiped out at late times by free streaming. Once
particle interactions will be taken into account, they will compensate this
damping. If we suppress this damping in a way suggested by the
fluctuation-dissipation relations of KFT, our results show that the complete
hierarchy of initial momentum correlations is responsible for a large part of
the characteristic non-linear deformation and the mode transport in the
density-fluctuation power spectrum. Without any adjustable parameters, KFT
accurately reproduces the scale at which non-linear evolution sets in.
  Finally, we further develop perturbation theory based on the factorization of

$0.^d 1584325$. Sixty two new eclipse times were determined by our observations
and the AAVSO International Data base. Combining all available eclipse times,
we analyzed the O-C behavior of LX Ser. We found that the O-C diagram of LX Ser
shows a sinusoidal oscillation with a period of 22.8 yr and an amplitude of
0.00035 days. Two mechanisms (i.e., the Applegate mechanism and the light
travel time effect) are applied to explain the cyclic modulation. We found that
the Applegate mechanism is difficult to explain the cyclic oscillation in the
orbital period. Therefore, the cyclic period change is most likely to be caused
by the light travel time effect due to the presence of a third body. The mass
of the tertiary component was determined to be $M_3\sim7.5 M_{Jup}$. We
supposed that the tertiary companion is plausible a giant planet. The stability
of the giant planet was checked, and we found that the multiple system is
stable.

identifies two nested models (upper and lower confidence bound models)

proposes a group of nested models as candidates and the MCB's width and

introduced to visualize the variability of model selection and to compare
different model selection procedures. The MCB methodology is implemented by a
fast bootstrap algorithm that is shown to yield the correct asymptotic coverage
under rather general conditions. Our Monte Carlo simulations and real data

the outage probability performance. In addition, they often assume that the

achieves fairness in a random field of relays without deteriorating the outage
probability performance. In this scheme, each relay maintains a countdown timer
whose initial value is a function of the relay location and a tunable parameter
which controls the level of fairness. The optimum value of this parameter is
evaluated in an offline manner so as to achieve fairness by making the average
powers consumed by the relays as close as possible. An exact analytical
expression is derived for the average power consumed by each relay. This
expression is then used to show the superiority of the proposed scheme over
opportunistic relaying and random relay selection schemes.

visual image features associated with dreamed objects are represented in the

features for dreamed objects were analyzed with brain decoding of fMRI data
collected during dreaming. The decoders were first trained with
stimulus-induced brain activity labeled with the feature values of the stimulus
image from multiple DNN layers. The decoders were then used to decode DNN
features from the dream fMRI data, and the decoded features were compared with
the averaged features of each object category calculated from a large-scale
image database. We found that the feature values decoded from the dream fMRI
data positively correlated with those associated with dreamed object categories
at mid- to high-level DNN layers. Using the decoded features, the dreamed
object category could be identified at above-chance levels by matching them to
the averaged features for candidate categories. The results suggest that
dreaming recruits hierarchical visual feature representations associated with

an optimal number of active graphene layer pairs corresponding to the maximum
net modal gain. The maximum gain increases with frequency and can be as large

algorithm is FFT-based and uses the so-called Ewald decomposition, which is
naturally most efficient for the triply periodic case. In this paper, we show
how to extend the triply periodic Spectral Ewald method to the singly periodic
case, such that the cost of computing the singly periodic potential is only
marginally larger than the cost of computing the potential for the
corresponding triply periodic system.
  In the Fourier space contribution of the Ewald decomposition, a Fourier
series is obtained in the periodic direction with a Fourier integral over the
non periodic directions for each discrete wave number. We show that upsampling
to resolve the integral is only needed for modes with small wave numbers. For
the zero wave number, this Fourier integral has a singularity. For this mode,
we effectively need to solve a free-space Poisson equation in two dimensions. A
very recent idea by Vico et al. makes it possible to use FFTs to solve this
problem, allowing us to unify the treatment of all modes. An adaptive 3D FFT
can be established to apply different upsampling rates locally. The
computational cost for other parts of the algorithm is essentially unchanged as
compared to the triply periodic case, in total yielding only a small increase
in both computational cost and memory usage for this singly periodic case.

consider screens occupying an arbitrary bounded subset of the plane. Thus our
study includes cases where the screen is a relatively open set with a boundary
that is fractal, or indeed has positive surface measure, and cases where the
screen has empty interior and is fractal, or indeed has positive surface
measure. We elucidate for which screen geometries the classical formulations of
screen scattering are well-posed, showing that the classical formulation for
sound-hard scattering is not well-posed if the screen boundary has Hausdorff
dimension greater than $n-2$. We also propose novel well-posed boundary
integral equation (BIE) and boundary value problem (BVP) formulations, valid
for arbitrary bounded screens. In fact, we show that for sufficiently irregular
screens there exist whole families of well-posed formulations, with infinitely
many distinct solutions, the distinct formulations distinguished by the sense
in which the boundary conditions are understood. To select the physically
correct solution we propose limiting geometry principles, taking the limit of
solutions for a convergent sequence of more regular screens, this a natural
procedure for those fractal screens for which there exists a standard sequence
of prefractal approximations. We present examples exhibiting interesting
physical behaviours, including penetration of waves through screens with

its corresponding `dynamic' (time-dependent) saddle-node bifurcation by the
modern theory of non-autonomous dynamical systems. We show that the actual
point of no return for a system undergoing tipping can be significantly delayed
in comparison to the {\em breaking time} $\hat{\tau}$ at which the
corresponding autonomous system with a time-independent parameter $p_{a}=
p(\hat{\tau})$ undergoes a bifurcation. A dimensionless parameter
$\alpha=\lambda p_0^3V^{-2}$ is introduced, in which $\lambda$ is the curvature
of the autonomous saddle-node bifurcation according to parameter $p(\tau)$,
which has an initial value of $p_{0}$ and a constant rate of change $V$. We

of no return $\tau^*$ after which the critical transition is irreversible;

to high energies over very short distances. The accelerated electron bunches
have femtosecond duration, making them particularly relevant for applications
such as ultrafast imaging or femtosecond X-ray generation. Current laser-plasma
accelerators are typically driven by Joule-class laser systems that have two
main drawbacks: their relatively large scale and their low repetition-rate,
with a few shots per second at best. The accelerated electron beams have
energies ranging from 100 MeV to multi-GeV, however a MeV electron source would
be more suited to many societal and scientific applications. Here, we
demonstrate a compact and reliable laser-plasma accelerator producing
high-quality few-MeV electron beams at kilohertz repetition rate. This
breakthrough was made possible by using near-single-cycle light pulses, which
lowered the required laser energy for driving the accelerator by three orders
of magnitude, thus enabling high repetition-rate operation and dramatic
downsizing of the laser system. The measured electron bunches are collimated,
with an energy distribution that peaks at 5 MeV and contains up to 1 pC of
charge. Numerical simulations reproduce all experimental features and indicate
that the electron bunches are only $\sim 1$ fs long. We anticipate that the
advent of these kHz femtosecond relativistic electron sources will pave the way
to wide-impact applications, such as ultrafast electron diffraction in
materials with an unprecedented sub-10 fs resolution.

masks reveal the presence of an X shape. Simulations show that these shapes can
be produced by dynamical processes driven by a bar which vertically thickens
the centre. In the Milky Way, which contains such a B/PS bulge, the X-shaped
structure is traced by the metal-rich stars but not by the metal-poor ones.
Recently Debattista et al. (2016) interpreted this property as a result of the
varying effect of the bar on stellar populations with different starting
kinematics. This kinematic fractionation model predicts that cooler populations
at the time of bar formation go on to trace the X shape, whereas hotter
populations are more uniformly distributed. As this prediction is not specific
to the Milky Way, we test it with MUSE observations of the B/PS bulge in the
nearby galaxy NGC 4710. We show that the metallicity map is more peanut-shaped
than the density distribution itself, in good agreement with the prediction.
This result indicates that the X-shaped structure in B/PS bulges is formed of
relatively metal-rich stars that have been vertically redistributed by the bar,
whereas the metal-poor stars have a more uniform, box-shaped distribution.

resource-constrained mobile devices. Mobile Cloud Computing is emerging as a
key technology to utilize virtually unlimited resources over the Internet using
Smartphones. Offloading data and computations to improve productivity, enhance
performance, save energy, and improve user experience. Social network
applications largely utilize Mobile Cloud Computing to reap the benefits. The
social network has witnessed unprecedented growth in the recent years, and
millions of registered users access it using Smartphones. The mobile cloud
social network applications introduce not only convenience but also various
issues related to criminal and illegal activities. Despite being primarily used
to communicate and socialize with contacts, the multifarious and anonymous
nature of social networking websites increases susceptibility to cybercrimes.
Taking into account, the advantage of mobile cloud computing and popularity of
social network applications, it is essential to establish a forensic framework
based on mobile cloud platform that solves the problems of today forensic
requirements. In this paper we present a mobile cloud forensic framework that
allows the forensic investigator to collect the automated synchronized copies

advancement of forensic tools and methodologies are much slower than the

results: the Hilbert-Schmidt volume of all locally diagonalizable states, and a
necessary and sufficient condition for local diagonalizability in the
qubit-qubit case. Besides, we partition the set of all locally diagonalizable
states as local unitary orbits (or coadjoint orbits) of diagonal forms. It is
well-known that the Riemannian volume of a coadjoint orbit for a regular point
in a specified Weyl chamber can be calculated by Harish-Chandra's volume
formula. By modifying Harish-Chandra's volume formula, we give, for the first
time, a specific formula for the Riemannian volume of a local unitary orbit of
a regular point in a specified Weyl chamber. Several open questions are
presented as well.

labels, e.g., face, pants, left-leg, has wide applications.
However,pixel-wisely annotating all frames is tedious and inefficient. In this
paper, we develop a Single frame Video Parsing (SVP) method which requires only
one labeled frame per video in training stage. To parse one particular frame,
the video segment preceding the frame is jointly considered. SVP (1) roughly
parses the frames within the video segment, (2) estimates the optical flow
between frames and (3) fuses the rough parsing results warped by optical flow
to produce the refined parsing result. The three components of SVP, namely
frame parsing, optical flow estimation and temporal fusion are integrated in an
end-to-end manner. Experimental results on two surveillance video datasets show
the superiority of SVP over state-of-the-arts.

this process. We obtain the uniform consistency and rates of convergence for
the proposed kernel based estimators. This problem has relevant applications in
ecology, in estimating the home-range and the core-area of an animal based on
tracking data. Recently, the problem of estimat- ing the domain of a reflected
Brownian motion was considered in Cholaquidis, et al. (2016), when the
stationary distribution is uniform and the estimation of the core-area, defined
as a level set of the stationary distribution, is meaningless. As a by-product
of our results, we obtain an estimation of the drift function. In order to
prove our re- sults, some new theoretical properties of the reflected Brownian

structures provide a general framework for the study of different structures of
interest in algebraic logic. In any hemiimplicative semilattice it is possible
to define a derived operation by $a \sim b := (a \to b) \wedge (b \to a)$.
Endowing $(A, \wedge, 1)$ with the binary operation $\sim$ results again a
hemiimplicative semilattice, which also satisfies the identity $a \sim b = b

this article, we study the correspondence assigning the symmetric
hemiimplicative semilattice $(A, \wedge, \sim , 1)$ to the hemiimplicative
semilattice $(A, \wedge, \to, 1)$. In particular, we characterize the image of
this correspondence. We also provide many new examples of hemiimplicative
semilattice structures on any bounded semillatice (possibly with bottom).
Finally, we characterize congruences on the clases of hemiimplicative

satifying assignments of a Boolean system of equations defined by Boolean
functions of several variables. While there are we known solvers for
satisfiability of Boolean formulas in CNF form, these are designed primarily
for deciding satisfiability of the formula and do not address the problem of
finding all satisfying solutions. Moreover development of parallel solvers for
satisfiability problems is still an unfinished problem of Computer Science. The
solver proposed in this paper is aimed at representing all solutions of Boolean
formulas even without the CNF form with a parallel algorithm. Algorithm
proposed is applied to Boolean functions in algebraic normal form (ANF). The
algorithm is based on the idea to represent the satisfying assignments in terms
of a complete set of implicants of the Boolean functions appearing as factors
of a Boolean formula. The algorithm is effective mainly in the case when the
factors of the formula are sparse (i.e. have a small fraction of the total
number of variables). This allows small computation of a complete set of
implicants of individual factors one at a time and reduce the formula at each
step. An algorithm is also proposed for finding a complete set of orthogonal
implicants of functions in ANF. An advantages of this algorithm is that all
solutions can be represented compactly in terms of implicants. Finally due to
small and distributed computation at every step as well as computation in terms
of independent threads, the solver proposed in this paper is expected to be
useful for developing heuristics for a well scalable parallel solver for large
size problems of Boolean satisfiability over large number of processors.

provided by GFUs to accommodate intermittent renewable energies. The GFUs'
capability of power generation relies on the availability of gas resources,
which is determined jointly by the capacity of gas suppliers and their

to meet the generation schedules due to insufficient gas supply. When facing
larger shares of renewable energies and more-frequent gas network congestion,
the current market framework is especially unreliable and inefficient, and also
economically unfriendly to the investors of the GFU assets. In this paper, we
try to develop a framework which can combine the two markets. By properly

can help allocate them more efficiently while satisfying the demands. And by
considering the uncertainty brought by renewable energies, a more

to calibrate the Teff-R relation finding that it has a strong dependence with
the ionizing parameter while it shows a weak direct dependence with the
metallicity (variations in Z imply variations in U) of both the stellar
atmosphere of the ionizing star and the gas phase of the HII region. Since the
R index varies slightly with the Teff for values larger than 40 kK, the R index
can be used to derive the Teff in 30-40 kK range. A large fraction of the
ionization parameter variation is due to differences in the temperature of the
ionizing stars and then the use of the (relatively) low Teff dependent S2=[S
II](6717+31)/Ha emission-line ratio to derive the ionization parameter is
preferable over others in the literature. We propose linear metallicity
dependent relationships between S2 and U. Teff and metallicity estimations for
a sample of 865 HII regions, whose emission-line intensities were compiled from
the literature, do not show any Teff-Z correlation. On the other hand it seems
to be hints of the presence of an anti-correlation between Teff-U. We found
that the majority of the studied HII regions (87%) present Teff values in the

early Universe attract attention as progenitors of supermassive black holes
observed at high redshifts. To form SMSs by accretion, central protostars must
accrete at as high rates as ~ 0.1-1 M_sun/yr. Such protostars have very
extended structures with bloated envelopes, like super-giant stars, and are
called super-giant protostars (SGPSs). Under the assumption of hydrostatic
equilibrium, SGPSs have density inverted layers, where the luminosity becomes
locally super-Eddington, near the surface. If the envelope matter is allowed to
flow out, however, a stellar wind could be launched and hinder the accretion
growth of SGPSs before reaching the supermassive regime. We examine whether
radiation-driven winds are launched from SGPSs by constructing steady and
spherically symmetric wind solutions. We find that the wind velocity does not
reach the escape velocity in any case considered. This is because once the
temperature falls below ~ 10^4 K, the opacity plummet drastically owing to the
recombination of hydrogen and the acceleration ceases suddenly. This indicates
that, in realistic non-steady cases, even if outflows are launched from the
surface of SGPSs, they would fall back again. Such a ""wind"" does not result in
net mass loss and does not prevent the growth of SGPSs. In conclusion, SGPSs
will grow to SMSs and eventually collapse to massive BHs of ~ 10^5 M_sun, as
long as the rapid accretion is maintained.

already familiar with the principles. It includes recent results of selected
experiments not present at this conference, e.g., LOPES and TREND. Current
radio arrays like AERA or Tunka-Rex have demonstrated that areas of several
km^2 can be instrumented for reasonable costs with antenna spacings of the
order of 200 m. For the energy of the primary particle such sparse antenna
arrays can already compete in absolute accuracy with other precise techniques,
like the detection of air-fluorescence or air-Cherenkov light. With further
improvements in the antenna calibration, the radio detection might become even
more accurate. For the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, Xmax, currently
only the dense array LOFAR features a precision similar to the fluorescence
technique, but analysis methods for the radio measurement of Xmax are still
under development. Moreover, the combination of radio and muon measurements is
expected to increase the accuracy of the mass composition, and this
around-the-clock recording is not limited to clear nights as are the

Using the Madelung transformation, we derive the hydrodynamic representation of

equation involving a friction force proportional and opposite to the velocity
and a pressure force associated with an equation of state determined by the
nonlinearity present in the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. In the
strong friction limit, we obtain a quantum Smoluchowski equation. These
equations satisfy an $H$-theorem for a free energy functional constructed with
a generalized entropy. We specifically consider the Boltzmann and Tsallis
entropies associated with isothermal and polytropic equations of state. We also
consider the entropy associated with the logotropic equation of state. We
derive the virial theorem corresponding to the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii
equation, damped quantum Euler equation, and quantum Smoluchowski equation.
Using a Gaussian ansatz, we obtain a simple equation governing the dynamical
evolution of the size of the condensate. We highlight a specific model of dark
matter halos corresponding to a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a
logarithmic nonlinearity and a cubic nonlinearity. It leads to dark matter
halos with an equation of state $P=\rho k_B T_{\rm eff}/m+2\pi

theorem is not directly observable either experimentally or computationally, a

addressing two main tasks: 1) learning phase: given a dataset, learn a concise
representation of the dataset in the form of a graphical model (or a neural
network), 2) recall phase: given a noisy version of a message vector from the
dataset, output the correct message vector via a neurally feasible algorithm

problem of designing a class of neural associative memories which learns a

tolerate $\Omega(\frac{n}{{\rm polylog} n})$ adversarial errors. This paper
carries out this memory design by mapping the learning phase and recall phase

observatories must ensure that their operations are efficient and effective. A
number of key performance indicators are generally used to evaluate the
observatory's performance among which are the numbers of publications and
citations of refereed journal articles to measure the overall scientific
impact. Those measures, however, are broad and can not assess whether the
observatory was successful on a project-by-project basis to deliver data to the
PIs enabling them to carry out their science and to publish their results. In
particular the reasons that prevented PIs from publishing remain hidden.
Understanding and acting upon those reasons, however, have the potential to
substantially improve the observatory's operational model. Of course not every
approved project even should lead to a publication. Indeed, the risk of not
finding the expected (or any unexpected) science in the data the PI receives is
an inherent and indispensable part of the scientific process. But even here,
measuring the fraction of such projects can lead to valuable insights which
might then be used to instruct future proposal review committees. To fully
close the loop on the end-to-end data-flow, ALMA has started in March 2015 to
send survey questions to PIs where two years after the end of the proprietary

flip the sign of the group velocity of the resulting hybrid

estimate we can settle an open question previously posed in the literature:
velocity-dependent one-scale (VOS) models for global monopoles predict two
branches of scaling solutions, one with monopoles moving at subluminal speeds
and one with monopoles moving at luminal speeds. Previous attempts to estimate
monopole velocities had large uncertainties and were not able to settle that

estimate the values of the parameters of the VOS model. With our new method we
can also study the microphysics of the complicated dynamics of individual

However, the choice of the variational posterior determines tractability and
flexibility of the VAE. Commonly, latent variables are modeled using the normal
distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix. This results in computational
efficiency but typically it is not flexible enough to match the true posterior
distribution. One fashion of enriching the variational posterior distribution
is application of normalizing flows, i.e., a series of invertible
transformations to latent variables with a simple posterior. In this paper, we
follow this line of thinking and propose a volume-preserving flow that uses a
series of Householder transformations. We show empirically on MNIST dataset and
histopathology data that the proposed flow allows to obtain more flexible
variational posterior and competitive results comparing to other normalizing

hole are constrained to the equation for the motion of the particle and are
consistent with the laws of thermodynamics. Particle absorption increases the
mass of the Kerr-Sen black hole to more than that of the absorbed charges such

overcharged. In the near-extremal black hole, we observe a violation of the
cosmic censorship conjecture for the angular momentum in the first order of

we prove the stability of the black hole horizon. Thus, we resolve the

emitter to a nearby metallic surface, producing evanescent surface waves that
are plasmonic in nature. When investigating a metallic nanohole supported on an
optically dense substrate (such as diamond with nitrogen vacancy center), the
scattering occurred preferentially from the diamond substrate towards the air
for dipole distances less 10 nm from the aperture. In addition, an enhancement
to the dipole's radiative decay rate was observed when resonance of the
aperture matched the emitters wavelength. The relationship between an emitter
and a nearby resonant aperture is shown to be that of the resonance energy
transfer where the emitter acts as a donor and the hole as an acceptor. In
conjunction with the preferential scattering behavior, this has led to the
proposed device that operates in transmission mode, eliminating the need for
epi-illumination techniques and optically denser than air superstrates in the
collection cycle, hence making the design simpler and more suitable for
miniaturization. A design criterion for the surface grating is also proposed to
improve the performance, where the period of the grating differs significantly
from the wavelength of the surface plasmon polaritons. Response of the proposed
device is further studied with respect to changes in nitrogen vacancy's
position and its dipolar orientation to identify the crystallographic planes of
diamond over which the performance of the device is maximized.

model of gauged $L_\mu - L_\tau$, linked with muon $g-2$ hence with very light
$Z'$, is given. Adding vector-like quarks that mix with usual quarks, $W$-boson
loops induce $s\to dZ'$ and $b\to sZ'$ transitions. Besides realizing the
scenario, the model provides further illustration of potential impact. Given
that usual dark bosons linked with the photon are tightly constrained, KOTO has
a unique opportunity to probe the muon-related dark sector.

lighter than dark matter. These states provide DM with an efficient

be reconciled. This simple setup realizes the idea of `secluded' dark matter

in a supersonic gas jet. To identify the contribution of harmonic generation
from clusters versus that from gas monomers, we measure the high-order harmonic
output over a broad range of the total atomic number density in the jet (from
3*10^16 cm^{-3} to 3x10^18 cm{-3}) at two different reservoir temperatures (303
K and 363 K). For the firrst time in the evaluation of the harmonic yield in
such measurements, the variation of the liquid mass fraction, g, versus
pressure and temperature is taken into consideration, which we determine,
reliably and consistently, to be below 20% within our range of experimental
parameters. By comparing the measured harmonic yield from a thin jet with the
calculated corresponding yield from monomers alone, we find an increased
emission of the harmonics when the average cluster size is less than 3000.
Using g, under the assumption that the emission from monomers and clusters add
up coherently, we calculate the ratio of the average single-atom response of an
atom within a cluster to that of a monomer and find an enhancement of around 10
for very small average cluster size (~200). We do not find any dependence of
the cut-off frequency on the composition of the cluster jet. This implies that
HHG in clusters is based on electrons that return to their parent ions and not
to neighbouring ions in the cluster. To fully employ the enhanced average
single-atom response found for small average cluster sizes (~200), the nozzle
producing the cluster jet must provide a large liquid mass fraction at these
small cluster sizes for increasing the harmonic yield. Moreover, cluster jets
may allow for quasi-phase matching, as the higher mass of clusters allows for a
higher density contrast in spatially structuring the nonlinear medium.

the future of a resource field and the actions of other agents. Once the agents
make a prediction, they are attracted to move towards regions that have, and
will have, denser resources. We find that the further the agents attempt to see

number of downloads, installations, or user ratings. A problem with these
measures is that they reflect actual usage at most indirectly. Indeed, analytic
companies have suggested that retention rates, i.e., the number of days users
continue to interact with an installed app are low. We conduct the first
independent and large-scale study of retention rates and usage behavior trends
in the wild. We study their impact on a large-scale database of app-usage data
from a community of 339,842 users and more than 213,667 apps. Our analysis
shows that, on average, applications lose 70% of their users in the first week,
while very popular applications (top 100) lose only 45%. It also reveals,
however, that many applications have more complex usage behavior patterns due
to seasonality, marketing, or other factors. To capture such effects, we
develop a novel app-usage behavior trend measure which provides instantaneous
information about the ""hotness"" of an application. We identify typical trends
in app popularity and classify applications into archetypes. From these, we can
distinguish, for instance, trendsetters from copycat apps. In our results,
roughly 40% of all apps never gain more than a handful of users. Less than 0.4%
of the remaining 60% are constantly popular, 1% flop after an initial steep
rise, and 7% continuously rise in popularity. We conclude by demonstrating that
usage behavior trend information can be used to develop better mobile app
recommendations. With the proposed usage-based measures (retention and trend),
we are able to shift sovereignty in app recommendations back to where it really
matters: actual usage statistics, in contrast to download count and user
ratings which are prone to manipulation by people.

nucleation, growth of vapor bubble and subsequent breakup of droplet for

observed to be the dominant phenomenon in 30% butanol blend, while
micro-explosion was found to be the dominant one in other fuel blends (blend
with 50% butanol or 30% A-B-E or 50% A-B-E). It was observed that puffing
always preceded the micro-explosion. The probability of micro-explosion in
droplets with A-B-E blends was found to be higher than that of butanol blends.
Although the rate of bubble growth was almost similar for all butanol and A-B-E

higher for 50/50 blends than that of 30/70 blends. The occurrence of
micro-explosion shortened the droplet lifetime, and this effect appeared to be
stronger for droplets with 50/50 composition. Micro-explosion led to the
ejection of both larger and smaller secondary droplets; however, puffing
resulted in relatively smaller secondary droplets compared to micro-explosion.
Puffing/micro-explosion were also observed in the secondary droplets.

recover the erased symbol by collecting a sufficiently large number of its
traces, each of which can be constructed from a number of traces of other
symbols. We extend the trace collection technique to cope with two and three
erasures.

most of his career at the University of Michigan. Gehring's major research
contributions were to Geometric Function Theory, particularly in higher
dimensions $\IR^n$, $n\geq 3$. This field he developed in close coordination
with colleagues, primarily in Finland, over three decades 1960 -- 1990.
Gehring's seminal work drove this field forward initiating important
connections with geometry and nonlinear partial differential equations, while
addressing and solving major problems. During his career Gehring received many
honours from the international mathematical community. He was invited three
times to address the International Congress of Mathematicians, at Moscow in
1966, at Vancouver in 1974, and at Berkeley (a plenary lecture) in 1986. He was
awarded honorary degrees from the University of Helsinki (1979), the University
of Jyv\""askyl\""a (1990), and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology
(1997). In 1989, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences
and the National Academy of Sciences. This is an extended obituary of his life

  scale relativity",,"Eur. Phys. J. Plus, 132, 286 (2017)",,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using Nottale's theory of scale relativity relying on a fractal space-time,
we derive a generalized Schr\""odinger equation taking into account the
interaction of the system with the external environment. This equation
describes the irreversible evolution of the system towards a static quantum
state. We first interpret the scale-covariant equation of dynamics stemming
from Nottale's theory as a hydrodynamic viscous Burgers equation for a
potential flow involving a complex velocity field and an imaginary viscosity.
We show that the Schr\""odinger equation can be directly obtained from this
equation by performing a Cole-Hopf transformation equivalent to the WKB
transformation. We then introduce a friction force proportional and opposite to
the complex velocity in the scale-covariant equation of dynamics in a way that
preserves the local conservation of the normalization condition. We find that
the resulting generalized Schr\""odinger equation, or the corresponding fluid
equations obtained from the Madelung transformation, involve not only a damping
term but also an effective thermal term. The friction coefficient and the
temperature are related to the real and imaginary parts of the complex friction
coefficient in the scale-covariant equation of dynamics. This may be viewed as
a form of fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We show that our generalized
Schr\""odinger equation satisfies an $H$-theorem for the quantum Boltzmann free
energy. As a result, the probability distribution relaxes towards an
equilibrium state which can be viewed as a Boltzmann distribution including a
quantum potential. We propose to apply this generalized Schr\""odinger equation
to dark matter halos in the Universe, possibly made of self-gravitating
Bose-Einstein condensates.

detector in the Mediterranean Sea. In this paper, the processes that limit the
obtainable resolution in both energy and direction in charged-current neutrino
events in the ORCA detector are investigated. These processes include the
composition of the hadronic fragmentation products, the subsequent particle
propagation and the photon-sampling fraction of the detector. GEANT simulations
of neutrino interactions in seawater produced by GENIE are used to study the
effects in the 1 - 20 GeV range. It is found that fluctuations in the hadronic
cascade in conjunction with the variation of the inelasticity y are most
detrimental to the resolutions. The effect of limited photon sampling in the
detector is of significantly less importance. These results will therefore also
be applicable to similar detectors/media, such as those in ice.

Specifically, we maximize the path entropy over discrete time step trajectories

together with a path-dependent dynamical information constraint reflecting a
given average global behavior of the complex system. A general expression for
the transition probability values associated with the stationary random Markov
processes describing the nonequilibrium stationary system is computed. By
virtue of our analysis, we uncover that a convenient choice of the dynamical
information constraint together with a perturbative asymptotic expansion with

Glauber hyperbolic tangent rule for the transition probability for the
stochastic Ising model in the limit of very high temperatures of the heat

  Reanalysis of 18 Published Datasets","24 pages, 1 table, 4 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background Network analyses on psychopathological data focus on the network
structure and its derivatives such as node centrality. One conclusion one can
draw from centrality measures is that the node with the highest centrality is
likely to be the node that is determined most by its neighboring nodes.
However, centrality is a relative measure: knowing that a node is highly
central gives no information about the extent to which it is determined by its
neighbors. Here we provide an absolute measure of determination (or
controllability) of a node - its predictability. We introduce predictability,
estimate the predictability of all nodes in 18 prior empirical network papers
on psychopathology, and statistically relate it to centrality.
  Methods We carried out a literature review and collected 25 datasets from 18
published papers in the field (several mood and anxiety disorders, substance
abuse, psychosis, autism, and transdiagnostic data). We fit state-of-the-art
net- work models to all datasets, and computed the predictability of all nodes.
  Results Predictability was unrelated to sample size, moderately high in most
symptom networks, and differed considerable both within and between datasets.
Predictability was higher in community than clinical samples, highest for mood
and anxiety disorders, and lowest for psychosis.
  Conclusions Predictability is an important additional characterization of
symptom networks because it gives an absolute measure of the controllability of
each node. It allows conclusions about how self-determined a symptom network
is, and may help to inform intervention strategies. Limitations of
predictability along with future directions are discussed.

software effort estimation. The fundamental concept of ABE is closer to the
mentality of expert estimation but with an automated procedure in which the
final estimate is generated by reusing similar historical projects. The main
key issue when using ABE is how to adapt the effort of the retrieved nearest
neighbors. The adaptation process is an essential part of ABE to generate more
successful accurate estimation based on tuning the selected raw solutions,
using some adaptation strategy. In this study we show that there are three
interrelated decision variables that have great impact on the success of
adaptation method: (1) number of nearest analogies (k), (2) optimum feature set
needed for adaptation, and (3) adaptation weights. To find the right decision
regarding these variables, one need to study all possible combinations and
evaluate them individually to select the one that can improve all prediction
evaluation measures. The existing evaluation measures usually behave
differently, presenting sometimes opposite trends in evaluating prediction
methods. This means that changing one decision variable could improve one
evaluation measure while it is decreasing the others. Therefore, the main theme
of this research is how to come up with best decision variables that improve
adaptation strategy and thus, the overall evaluation measures without degrading
the others. The impact of these decisions together has not been investigated
before, therefore we propose to view the building of adaptation procedure as a
multi-objective optimization problem. The Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm

  X-ray dark-field radiography is a recent non-destructive imaging method which
is sensitive to microstructural variations. In this study, the method was
applied for quantitative in-situ monitoring of barley seeds. Microstructural
changes relating to water uptake and modification were monitored over a 43-55 h
period.
  Sub-resolution stress cracks as well as a dark-field signal believed to
originate from starch granules were detected. The evolution of the dark-field
signal followed the known modification pattern in barley seeds. Through image
analysis, quantitative parameters describing the movement of the front of the
observed pattern were obtained.
