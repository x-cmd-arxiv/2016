effective theory of heavy-light mesons, interacting with the lowest lying
pseudoscalar and vector mesons. The heavy degrees of freedom are identified
with the $D8_L$-$D8_H$ string low energy modes, and are approximated near the
world volume of $N_f-1$ light $D8_L$ branes, by fundamental vector field valued
in $U(N_f-1)$. The effective action follows from the reduction of the bulk
D-brane Born-Infeld (DBI) and Chern-Simons (CS) actions, and is shown to
exhibit both chiral and heavy-quark symmetry. The action interpolates
continuously between the $U(N_f)$ case with massless mesons, and the $U(N_f-1)$
case with heavy-light mesons. The heavy-light meson radial spectrum is
Regge-like. The one-pion and two-pion couplings to the heavy-light multiplets
are evaluated. The partial widths for the charged decays $G\rightarrow H+\pi$
are shown to be comparable to the recently reported full widths for both the
charm and bottom mesons.

closed bilayer membranes (vesicles, a model system for red blood cells) and
drops, is studied numerically with a special attention paid to the role of the
confinement (the particles are within two rigid walls). This study unveils the
complexity of the pairing mechanism due to hydrodynamic interactions. We find
both for vesicles and for drops that two particles attract each other and form
a stable pair at weak confinement if their initial separation is below a
certain value. If the initial separation is beyond that distance, the particles
repel each other and adopt a longer stable interdistance. This means that for
the same confinement we have (at least) two stable branches. To which branch a
pair of particles relaxes with time depends only on the initial configuration.
An unstable branch is found between these two stable branches. At a critical
confinement the stable branch corresponding to the shortest interdistance
merges with the unstable branch in the form of a saddle-node bifurcation. At
this critical confinement we have a finite jump from a solution corresponding
to the continuation of the unbounded case to a solution which is induced by the
presence of walls. The results are summarized in a phase diagram, which proves
to be of a complex nature. The fact that both vesicles and drops have the same
qualitative phase diagram points to the existence of a universal behavior,
highlighting the fact that with regard to pairing the details of mechanical
properties of the deformable particles are unimportant. This offers an
interesting perspective for simple analytical modeling.

in bundle geometry with a mixture of different chirality and present a unique
challenge to separate them. In this paper we have proposed the PAMAM dendrimer
to be an ideal candidate for this separation. To estimate efficiency of the
dendrimer in dispersion of CNTs from the bundle geometry, we have calculated
potential of mean forces (PMF). Our PMF study of two dendrimer wrapped CNTs
shows lesser binding affinity compared to the two bare CNTs. PMF study shows
that the binding affinity decreases for non-protonated dendrimer and for the
protonated case, the interaction is fully repulsive in nature. For both the
non-protonated as well as protonated cases, the PMF increases with increasing
dendrimer generations from 2 to 4 gradually compare to the bare PMF. We have
performed PMF calculations with (6,5) and (6,6) chirality to study the
chirality dependence of PMF. Calculated PMF for protonated dendrimer wrapped
chiral CNTs is more compared to the protonated dendrimer wrapped armchair CNTs
for all the generations studied. However, for non-protonated dendrimer wrapped
CNTs such chirality dependence is not very prominent. Our study suggests that
the dispersion efficiency of protonated dendrimer is more compared to the
non-protonated dendrimer and can be used as an effective dispersing agent in
dispersion of CNT from the bundle geometry.

slowly transitioned from a region that was mainly dark at 5 microns in February
2011 to a region that was almost entirely bright and remarkably uniform by
December of 2012. The uniformity and high emission levels suggested that the
entire wake region had been cleared not only of the ammonia clouds that the
storm had generated and exposed, but also of any other aerosols that might
provide significant blocking of the thermal emission from Saturn's deeper and
warmer atmospheric layers. Our analysis of VIMS wake spectra from December 2012
provides no evidence of ammonia ice absorption, but shows that at least one
significant cloud layer remained behind: a non-absorbing layer of 3 - 4 optical
depths (at 2 microns) extending from 150 to ~400 mbar. A second layer of
absorbing and scattering particles, with less than 1 optical depth and located
near 1 bar, is also suggested, but its existence as a model requirement depends
on what value of the He/H2 ratio is assumed. The observations can be fit well
with just a single (upper) cloud layer for a He/H2 ratio of 0.064 in
combination with a PH3 deep volume mixing ratio of 5 ppm. At lower He/H2
ratios, the observed spectra can be modeled without particles in this region.
At higher ratios, in order to fit the brightest wake spectrum, models must
include either significant cloud opacity in this region, or significantly
increased absorption by PH3, NH3, and AsH3. As the exceptional horizontal
uniformity in the late wake is most easily understood as a complete removal of
a deep cloud layer, and after considering independent constraints on trace gas
mixing ratios, we conclude that the existence of this remarkable wake
uniformity is most consistent with a He/H2 mixing ratio of 0.055 (+0.010,
-0.015), which is on the low side of the 0.038 - 0.135 range of previous

leads. Relying on a non-perturbative Green function formalism, our calculations
allow us to provide analytical expressions for the currents and their
correlations at subgap voltages, while also giving exact numerical results
valid for arbitrary external bias. We show that when the normal leads are
biased at voltages $V_1$ and $V_2$ smaller than the gap, the sign of the
current cross-correlations is given by $-\mbox{sgn}(V_1 \, V_2)$. In
particular, this leads to positive cross-correlations for opposite voltages, a
behavior in stark contrast with the one of a standard superconductor, which
provides a direct evidence of the presence of the Majorana zero-mode at the
edge of the TS. We further extend our results, varying the length of the TS
(leading to an overlap of the Majorana bound states) as well as its chemical
potential (driving it away from half-filling), generalizing the boundary TS
Green function to those cases. In the case of opposite bias voltages,
$\mbox{sgn}(V_1 \, V_2)=-1$, driving the TS wire through the topological
transition leads to a sign change of the current cross-correlations, providing
yet another signature of the physics of the Majorana bound state.

effective stress tests to quantify the resilience of financial institutions.
Here we propose a stress test methodology for central counterparties based on a
network characterization of clearing members, whose links correspond to direct
credits and debits. This network constitutes the ground for the propagation of
financial distress: equity losses caused by an initial shock with both
exogenous and endogenous components reverberate within the network and are
amplified through credit and liquidity contagion channels. At the end of the
dynamics, we determine the vulnerability of each clearing member, which
represents its potential equity loss. We apply the proposed framework to the
Fixed Income asset class of CC&G, the central counterparty operating in Italy
whose main cleared securities are Italian Government Bonds. We consider two
different scenarios: a distributed, plausible initial shock, as well as a shock
corresponding to the cover 2 regulatory requirement (the simultaneous default
of the two most exposed clearing members). Although the two situations lead to
similar results after an unlimited reverberation of shocks on the network, the
distress propagation is much more hasty in the latter case, with a large number
of additional defaults triggered at early stages of the dynamics. Our results
thus show that setting a default fund to cover insolvencies only on a cover 2
basis may not be adequate for taming systemic events, and only very
conservative default funds, such as CC&G's one, can face total losses due to
the shock propagation. Overall, our network-based stress test represents a
refined tool for calibrating default fund amounts.

Sightlines observed in mm-wave absorption and a few in UV show enhanced \coth\
by factors of 2-4 and are explained by higher n(H) $\ga256\pccc$ and/or weaker
radiation. The most difficult observations to understand are UV absorptions
having N(\cotw)/N(\coth) $>$100 and N(CO)$\ga10^{15}\pcc$. Plots of \WCO\ vs.
N(CO) show that \WCO\ remains linearly proportional to N(CO) even at high

curve of growth so their ratios of column density/integrated intensity are
comparable even when different from the isotopic abundance ratio. For
n(H)$\ga128\pccc$, plots of \WCO\ vs N(CH) are insensitive to n(H), and
\WCO/N(CO)$\approx1\Kkms/(10^{15}~{\rm CO}\pcc)$: This compensates for small
CO/\HH\ to make \WCO\ more readily detectable. Rapid increases of N(CO) with
n(H), N(H) and N(\HH) often render the CO bright, ie a small CO-\HH\ conversion
factor. For n(H) $\la64\pccc$ CO enters the regime of truly weak excitation
where \WCO $\propto$n(H)N(CO). \WCO\ is a strong function of the average \HH\

non-thermal emitters due to the interaction of the pulsar and the stellar wind.
The winds of massive stars are thought to be inhomogeneous, which could have an
impact on the non-thermal emission. We study numerically the impact of the
presence of inhomogeneities or clumps in the stellar wind on the high-energy
non-thermal radiation of high-mass binaries hosting a non-accreting pulsar. We
compute the trajectories and physical properties of the streamlines in the
shocked pulsar wind without clumps, with a small clump, and with a large one.
This information is used to compute the synchrotron and inverse Compton
emission from the non-thermal populations, accounting also for the effect of
gamma-ray absorption through pair creation. A specific study is done for PSR
B1259-63/LS2883. When stellar wind clumps perturb the two-wind interaction
region, the associated non-thermal radiation in the X-ray band,of synchrotron
origin, and in the GeV-TeV band, of inverse Compton origin, is affected by
several effects: (i) strong changes in the the plasma velocity direction that
result in Doppler boosting factor variations, (ii) strengthening of the
magnetic field that mainly enhances the synchrotron radiation, (iii)
strengthening of the pulsar wind kinetic energy dissipation at the shock,
potentially available for particle acceleration, and (iv) changes in the rate
of adiabatic losses that affect the lower energy part of the non-thermal
particle population. The radiation above 100 GeV detected, presumably, during
the post-periastron crossing of the Be star disc in PSR B1259-63/LS2883, can be
roughly reproduced assuming that the crossing of the disc is modeled as the
encounter with a large inhomogeneity.

matter, we find two different regimes in the evolution: for modes with $k^2\ll
{\cal H}ma$, we have a particle-like behaviour indistinguishable from cold dark
matter, whereas for modes with $k^2\gg {\cal H}ma$, we get a wave-like
behaviour in which the sound speed is non-vanishing and of order $c_s^2\simeq
k^2/m^2a^2$. This implies that, also in these models, structure formation could
be suppressed on small scales. However, unlike the scalar case, the fact that
the background evolution contains a non-vanishing homogeneous vector field
implies that, in general, the evolution of the three kinds of perturbations
(scalar, vector and tensor) can no longer be decoupled at the linear level.
More specifically, in the particle regime, the three types of perturbations are
actually decoupled, whereas in the wave regime, the three vector field
perturbations generate one scalar-tensor and two vector-tensor perturbations in
the metric. Also in the wave regime, we find that a non-vanishing anisotropic
stress is present in the perturbed energy-momentum tensor giving rise to a
gravitational slip of order $(\Phi-\Psi)/\Phi\sim c_s^2$. Moreover in this
regime the amplitude of the tensor to scalar ratio of the scalar-tensor modes

(IGM) predicts a decreasing temperature of the IGM with decreasing density once
hydrogen (and helium) reionisation is complete. Heating the high-redshift,
low-density IGM above the temperature expected from photo-heating is difficult,
and previous claims of high/rising temperatures in low density regions of the
Universe based on the probability density function (PDF) of the opacity in
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data at $2<z<4$ have been met with considerable
scepticism, particularly since they appear to be in tension with other
constraints on the temperature-density relation (TDR). We utilize here an
ultra-high signal-to-noise spectrum of the QSO HE0940-1050 and a novel
technique to study the low opacity part of the PDF. We show that there is
indeed evidence (at 90% confidence level) that a significant volume fraction of
the under-dense regions at $z \sim 3$ has temperatures as high or higher than
those at densities comparable to the mean and above. We further demonstrate
that this conclusion is nevertheless consistent with measurements of a slope of
the TDR in over-dense regions that imply a decreasing temperature with
decreasing density, as expected if photo-heating of ionised hydrogen is the
dominant heating process. We briefly discuss implications of our findings for
the need to invoke either spatial temperature fluctuations, as expected during
helium reionization, or additional processes that heat a significant volume
fraction of the low-density IGM.

the need to offer secure authentication while maintaining the privacy of the
biometric data. Previous solutions, such as Secure Sketch and Fuzzy Extractors,
rely on assumptions that cannot be guaranteed in practice, and often affect the
authentication accuracy.
  In this paper, we introduce HoneyFaces: the concept of adding a large set of
synthetic faces (indistinguishable from real) into the biometric ""password
file"". This password inflation protects the privacy of users and increases the
security of the system without affecting the accuracy of the authentication. In
particular, privacy for the real users is provided by ""hiding"" them among a
large number of fake users (as the distributions of synthetic and real faces
are equal). In addition to maintaining the authentication accuracy, and thus
not affecting the security of the authentication process, HoneyFaces offer
several security improvements: increased exfiltration hardness, improved
leakage detection, and the ability to use a Two-server setting like in
HoneyWords. Finally, HoneyFaces can be combined with other security and privacy
mechanisms for biometric data.
  We implemented the HoneyFaces system and tested it with a password file
composed of 270 real users. The ""password file"" was then inflated to
accommodate up to $2^{36.5}$ users (resulting in a 56.6 TB ""password file""). At
the same time, the inclusion of additional faces does not affect the true
acceptance rate or false acceptance rate which were 93.33\% and 0.01\%,
respectively.

symmetric alternating sign matrices (DASASMs) of fixed odd order with a maximal
number of $\alpha$'s along the diagonal and the antidiagonal, as well as
DASASMs of fixed odd order with a minimal number of $0$'s along the diagonal

have previously appeared in plane partition or alternating sign matrix
counting, namely for the number of all alternating sign matrices, the number of
cyclically symmetric plane partitions in a given box, and the number of
vertically and horizontally symmetric ASMs. We also prove several refinements.
For instance, in the case of DASASMs with a maximal number of $-1$'s along the
diagonal and the antidiagonal, these considerations lead naturally to the
definition of alternating sign triangles. These are new objects that are
equinumerous with ASMs, and we are able to prove a two parameter refinement of
this fact, involving the number of $-1$'s and the inversion number on the ASM
side. To prove our results, we extend techniques to deal with triangular
six-vertex configurations that have recently successfully been applied to
settle Robbins' conjecture on the number of all DASASMs of odd order.
Importantly, we use a general solution of the reflection equation to prove the
symmetry of the partition function in the spectral parameters. In all of our
cases, we derive determinant or Pfaffian formulas for the partition functions,
which we then specialize in order to obtain the product formulas for the
various classes of extreme odd DASASMs under consideration.

persist through the recurrence of similar local packing motifs. While the
short-range order in bulk amorphous phases has been well studied and identified
as an intrinsic factor determining the material properties, these features have
not been studied in disordered intergranular complexions. In this work, the
short-range order in two types of amorphous complexions is studied with a
Voronoi tessellation method. Amorphous complexions can have three distinct
regions: amorphous-crystalline interfaces, regions deep inside the films that
have short-range order identical to a bulk amorphous phase, and transition
regions that connect the first two regions. However, thin amorphous films
contain only the amorphous-crystalline interface and the transition region,
providing further evidence of the constraints imposed by the abutting crystals.
The thickness of the transition region depends on film thickness at low
temperatures but becomes thickness-independent at high temperatures. Similarly,
the complexion short-range order is dependent on the interfacing crystal plane
at low temperatures, but this effect is lost at high temperatures. Our findings
show that amorphous complexions contain spatial gradients in short-range order,
meaning they are both structurally and chemically different from bulk metallic
glasses.

at galactic scales due to debris and/or mergers. In standard unified models the
different AGN types are expected to show similar galaxy environments. We aim to
investigate properties and environment of obscured and unobscured AGNs selected
from the MUSYC survey, in order to test the unified model and evolutionary
scenarios. The sample of AGNs was selected from images obtained with the IRAC
Camera, based on their MIR colors. We selected two samples of AGNs with
redshifts in the range $1\le z \le 2$ and $M_v\leq -$21: obscured and
unobscured AGNs by means of a simple optical-MIR color cut criterion. We find
that obscured AGNs are intrinsically optically faint in the R band, suggesting
that luminous IR-selected AGNs have a significant dust extinction. From a
cross-correlation with several X-ray surveys, we find that the majority of the
AGNs have X-ray luminosities similar to those found in Seyfert-like galaxies.
Neighbouring galaxies located close to ($\sim$200 kpc) obscured AGNs tend to
have redder colors, compared to the local environment of unobscured AGNs.
Results obtained from a KS test show that the two color distributions are
different at $\sim$95% confidence level. We find that obscured AGNs are located
in denser local galaxy environments compared to the unobscured AGN sample. Our
results suggest that AGN obscuration can occur at galactic scales, possibly due
to galaxy interactions or mergers, and that the simple unified model based

analysis of complex stochastic system evolution. It was introduced by Neuts
\cite{Neuts1975} in 1975. The model describes the lifetime distribution of a
finite-state absorbing Markov chains, and has found many applications in wide
range of areas. It was brought to survival analysis by Aalen \cite{Aalen1995}
in 1995. However, the model has lacks of ability in modeling heterogeneity and
inclusion of past information which is due to the Markov property of the
underlying process that forms the model. We attempt to generalize the
distribution by replacing the underlying by Markov mixtures process. Markov
mixtures process was used to model jobs mobility by Blumen \cite{Blumen} et al.
in 1955. It was known as the mover-stayer model describing low-productivity
workers tendency to move out of their jobs by a Markov chains, while those with
high-productivity tend to stay in the job. Frydman \cite{Frydman2005} later
extended the model to a mixtures of finite-state Markov chains moving at
different speeds on the same state space. In general the mixtures process does
not have Markov property. We revisit the mixtures model \cite{Frydman2005} for
mixtures of multi absorbing states Markov chains, and propose generalization of
the phase-type distribution under competing risks. The new distribution has two
main appealing features: it has the ability to model heterogeneity and to
include past information of the underlying process, and it comes in a closed
form. Built upon the new distribution, we propose conditional forward intensity
which can be used to determine rate of occurrence of future events (caused by
certain type) based on available information. Numerical study suggests that the
new distribution and its forward intensity offer significant improvements over
the existing model.

bulk viscosity is proportional to the dark matter energy density and imposing a
complete cosmological dynamics, we find bounds on the bulk viscosity in order
to reproduce a matter-dominated era (MDE). This constraint is independent of
the interaction term. Some late time phantom solutions are mathematically
possible. However, the constraint imposed by a MDE restricts the interaction
parameter, in the phantom solutions, to a region consistent with a null value,
eliminating the possibility of late time stable solutions with $w<-1$. From the
different cases that we study, the only possible scenario, with bulk viscosity

  Device-to-Device Communication",,,,,"cs.GT cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Computation offloading via device-to-device (D2D) communication, or D2D
offloading, has recently been proposed to enhance mobile computing performance
by exploiting spare computing resources of nearby user devices. The success of
D2D offloading relies on user participation in collaborative service
provisioning, which incurs extra costs to users providing the service, thus
mandating an incentive mechanism that can compensate for these costs. Although
incentive mechanism design has been intensively studied in the literature, this
paper considers a much more challenging yet less investigated problem in which
selfish users are also facing interdependent security risks, such as infectious
proximity-based attacks. Security cost is significantly different in nature
from conventional service provisioning costs such as energy consumption, since
security risks often depend on the collective behavior of all users. To this
end, we build a novel mathematical framework by leveraging the combined power
of game theory and epidemic theory to investigate the interplay between user
incentives and interdependent security risks in D2D offloading, thereby
enabling the design of security-aware incentive mechanisms. Our analysis
discovers an interesting ""less is more"" phenomenon: although giving users more
incentives promotes more participation, it may harm the network operator's
utility. This is because too much participation may foster persistent security
risks and as a result, the effective participation level does not improve. Our
model and analysis shed new insights on the optimization of D2D offloading
networks in the presence of interdependent security risks. Extensive
simulations are carried out to verify our analytical conclusions.

asymmetric Josephson junctions coupled to a mechanical resonator embedded in

of the mechanical resonator is much lower than the cavity frequency of the
SQUID and in the case when they are comparable. In the first case, the
radiation pressure and cross-Kerr type interactions arise and are modified by
asymmetry. Cross-Kerr type coupling is the leading term at the extremum points
where radiation pressure is zero. In the second case, the main interaction is
single-photon beam splitter, which exists only at finite asymmetry. Another
interaction in this regime is of cross-Kerr type, which exists at all
asymmetries, but generally much weaker than the beam splitter interaction.
Increasing magnetic field can substantially enhance optomechanical couplings
strength with the potential for the radiation pressure coupling to reach the
single-photon strong coupling regime, even the ultrastrong coupling regime, in
which the single-photon coupling rate exceeds the mechanical frequency.

fast radio bursts (FRBs). We show that even if these manifest in only a
fraction of FRBs, gamma-ray detections with current satellites (including
Swift) can provide stringent constraints on cosmological FRB models. If the
energy is drawn from the magnetic energy of a compact object such as a
magnetized neutron star, the sources should be nearby and be very rare. If the
intergalactic medium is responsible for the observed dispersion measure, the
required gamma-ray energy is comparable to that of the early afterglow or
extended emission of short gamma-ray bursts. While this can be reconciled with
the rotation energy of compact objects, as expected in many merger scenarios,
the prompt outflow that yields the gamma-rays is too dense for radio waves to
escape. Highly relativistic winds launched in a precursor phase, and forming a
wind bubble, may avoid the scattering and absorption limits and could yield FRB
emission. Largely independent of source models, we show that detectable radio
afterglow emission from gamma-ray bright FRBs can reasonably be anticipated.
Gravitational wave searches can also be expected to provide useful tests.

generative models in which a generator is trained to optimize a cost function

learning cost functions is relatively new to the field of generative modeling,
learning costs has long been studied in control and reinforcement learning (RL)
domains, typically for imitation learning from demonstrations. In these fields,
learning cost function underlying observed behavior is known as inverse
reinforcement learning (IRL) or inverse optimal control. While at first the
connection between cost learning in RL and cost learning in generative modeling
may appear to be a superficial one, we show in this paper that certain IRL
methods are in fact mathematically equivalent to GANs. In particular, we
demonstrate an equivalence between a sample-based algorithm for maximum entropy
IRL and a GAN in which the generator's density can be evaluated and is provided
as an additional input to the discriminator. Interestingly, maximum entropy IRL
is a special case of an energy-based model. We discuss the interpretation of
GANs as an algorithm for training energy-based models, and relate this
interpretation to other recent work that seeks to connect GANs and EBMs. By
formally highlighting the connection between GANs, IRL, and EBMs, we hope that
researchers in all three communities can better identify and apply transferable
ideas from one domain to another, particularly for developing more stable and
scalable algorithms: a major challenge in all three domains.

approach to sharing and publishing 3-D structures interactively in online
scientific journals. The core characteristics of the X3D pathway are that: 1)
it does not rely on specific software, but rather a file format (X3D), 2) it
can be implemented using fully open-source tools, and 3) article readers can
access the interactive models using most main stream web browsers without the
need for any additional plugins. In this article, we further demonstrate the
potential of the X3D pathway to visualize datasets from optical integral field
spectrographs. We use recent observations of the oxygen-rich young supernova
remnant 1E0102.2-7219 in the Small Magellanic Cloud to implement additional
X3DOM tools & techniques and expand the range of interactions that can be
offered to article readers. In particular, we present a set of javascript
functions allowing the creation and interactive handling of clip planes,
effectively allowing users to take measurements of distances and angles
directly from the interactive model itself.

We identified 88 star forming regions in the H$\alpha$ emission data-cubes, and
27 molecular cloud complexes in the CO emission data-cubes. The surface
densities of the star formation rate and the molecular gas are significantly
higher in these systems than in non-interacting galaxies and the Galaxy, and
are closer to the surface densities of the star formation rate and the
molecular gas of extreme star forming galaxies at higher redshifts. The large
values of the velocity dispersion also show the enhanced gas surface density.
The HII regions are situated on the ${\rm{SFR}}-\sigma_v$ envelope, and so are
also in virial equilibrium. Since the virial parameter decreases with the
surface densities of both the star formation rate and the molecular gas, we
claim that the clouds presented here are gravitationally dominated rather than
being in equilibrium with the external pressure.

observations of Supernova 1987A. If dark photons are produced in sufficient
quantity, they reduce the amount of energy emitted in the form of neutrinos, in
conflict with observations. For the first time, we include the effects of
finite temperature and density on the kinetic-mixing parameter, epsilon, in
this environment. This causes the constraints on epsilon to weaken with the
dark-photon mass below ~ 15 MeV. For large-enough values of epsilon, it is well
known that dark photons can be reabsorbed within the supernova. Since the rates
of reabsorption processes decrease as the dark-photon energy increases, we
point out that dark photons with energies above the Wien peak can escape
without scattering, contributing more to energy loss than is possible assuming
a blackbody spectrum. Furthermore, we estimate the systematic uncertainties on
the cooling bounds by deriving constraints assuming one analytic and four
different simulated temperature and density profiles of the proto-neutron star.
Finally, we estimate also the systematic uncertainty on the bound by varying
the distance across which dark photons must propagate from their point of
production to be able to affect the star. This work clarifies the bounds from
SN1987A on the dark-photon parameter space.

extended HI discs. The study of the kinematics of such discs is a powerful tool
to estimate the total matter distribution at these very small scales. In this
work, we study the HI kinematics of 17 galaxies extracted from the `Local
Irregulars That Trace Luminosity Extremes, The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey' (LITTLE
THINGS). Our approach differs significantly from previous studies in that we
directly fit 3D models (two spatial dimensions plus one spectral dimension)
using the software $^\text{3D}$BAROLO, fully exploiting the information in the
HI datacubes. For each galaxy we derive the geometric parameters of the HI disc
(inclination and position angle), the radial distribution of the surface
density, the velocity-dispersion ($\sigma_v$) profile and the rotation curve.
The circular velocity (V$_{\text{c}}$), which traces directly the galactic
potential, is then obtained by correcting the rotation curve for the asymmetric
drift. As an initial application, we show that these dIrrs lie on a baryonic
Tully-Fisher relation in excellent agreement with that seen on larger scales.
The final products of this work are high-quality, ready-to-use kinematic data
($\textrm{V}_\textrm{c}$ and $\sigma_v$) that we make publicly available. These

campaign that aims to robustly calibrate mass-observable scaling relations over
a wide range in redshift to enable improved cosmological constraints from the
SPT cluster sample. We introduce new strategies to ensure that systematics in
the lensing analysis do not degrade constraints on cluster scaling relations
significantly. First, we efficiently remove cluster members from the source
sample by selecting very blue galaxies in V-I colour. Our estimate of the
source redshift distribution is based on CANDELS data, where we carefully mimic
the source selection criteria of the cluster fields. We apply a statistical
correction for systematic photometric redshift errors as derived from Hubble
Ultra Deep Field data and verified through spatial cross-correlations. We
account for the impact of lensing magnification on the source redshift
distribution, finding that this is particularly relevant for shallower surveys.
Finally, we account for biases in the mass modelling caused by miscentring and
uncertainties in the concentration-mass relation using simulations. In
combination with temperature estimates from Chandra we constrain the
normalisation of the mass-temperature scaling relation ln(E(z) M_500c/10^14

Way (MW) analogues selected from the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical
simulation. The stellar evolution model in EAGLE includes the physics of
enrichment by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, winds from massive stars,
and type I and type II supernovae (SNe). In the simulation, star formation in
young MW progenitors is bursty due to efficient stellar feedback, which causes
poor metal mixing leading to the formation of CEMP stars with extreme abundance
patterns. In this scenario, two classes of CEMP stars emerge: those mostly
enriched by low-metallicity type II SNe with low Fe yields that drive galactic
outflows, and those mostly enriched by AGB stars when a gas-poor progenitor
accretes pristine gas. The first class resembles CEMP-no stars with high [C/Fe]
and low [C/O], the second class resembles CEMP-s stars overabundant in
s-process elements and high values of [C/O]. This scenario explains several
trends seen in data: (i) the increase in the scatter and median of [C/O] at low
and decreasing [O/H], (ii) the trend of stars with very low [Fe/H] or [C/H] to
be of type CEMP-no, and (iii) the reduction in the scatter of [{\alpha}/Fe]
with atomic number in metal poor stars. In this interpretation CEMP-no stars
were enriched by the stars that enabled galaxies to reionise the Universe.

accrete gas from their surroundings, a process referred to as 'starvation' or
'strangulation' of satellites. We study the environmental dependence of gas
accretion onto galaxies using the cosmological, hydrodynamical EAGLE
simulation. We quantify the dependence of gas accretion on stellar mass,
redshift, and environment, using halo mass and galaxy overdensity as
environmental indicators. We find a strong suppression, by many orders of
magnitude, of the gas accretion rate in dense environments, primarily for
satellite galaxies. This suppression becomes stronger at lower redshift.
However, the scatter in accretion rates is very large for satellites. This is
(at least in part) due to the variation in halocentric radius, since gas
accretion is more suppressed at smaller radii. Central galaxies are influenced
less strongly by their environment and exhibit less scatter in their gas
accretion rates. The star formation rates of both centrals and satellites show
similar behaviour to their gas accretion rates. The relatively small
differences between gas accretion and star formation rates demonstrate that
galaxies generally exhaust their gas reservoir somewhat faster at higher
stellar mass, lower redshift, and in denser environments. We conclude that the
environmental suppression of gas accretion could directly result in the
quenching of star formation.

energies raises the question of which astrophysical sources generate this
signal. One class of extragalactic sources which may produce such high-energy
neutrinos are blazars. We present a likelihood analysis searching for
cumulative neutrino emission from blazars in the 2nd Fermi-LAT AGN catalogue
(2LAC) using an IceCube neutrino dataset 2009-12 which was optimised for the
detection of individual sources. In contrast to previous searches with IceCube,
the populations investigated contain up to hundreds of sources, the largest one
being the entire blazar sample in the 2LAC catalogue. No significant excess is
observed and upper limits for the cumulative flux from these populations are
obtained. These constrain the maximum contribution of the 2LAC blazars to the
observed astrophysical neutrino flux to be $27 \%$ or less between around 10
TeV and 2 PeV, assuming equipartition of flavours at Earth and a single
power-law spectrum with a spectral index of $-2.5$. We can still exclude that
the 2LAC blazars (and sub-populations) emit more than $50 \%$ of the observed
neutrinos up to a spectral index as hard as $-2.2$ in the same energy range.
Our result takes into account that the neutrino source count distribution is
unknown, and it does not assume strict proportionality of the neutrino flux to
the measured 2LAC $\gamma$-ray signal for each source. Additionally, we
constrain recent models for neutrino emission by blazars.

study the joint and marginal distributions of leaky RBM under different

anneal the leakiness rather than the energy; -- i.e., start from a fully
Gaussian/Linear unit and gradually decrease the leakiness over iterations. This
serves as an alternative to the annealing of the temperature parameter and
enables numerical estimation of the likelihood that are more efficient and more
accurate than the commonly used annealed importance sampling (AIS). We further
demonstrate that the proposed sampling algorithm enjoys faster mixing property
than contrastive divergence algorithm, which benefits the training without any
additional computational cost.

mechanisms to convert fuel in the environment to autonomous motion. Recent
experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that these autonomous engines
can passively follow the contours of solid boundaries they encounter. Boundary
guidance, however, is not necessarily stable: Mechanical disturbances can cause
the motor to hydrodynamically depart from the passively guided pathway.
Furthermore, given the scaled-down size of micromotors (typically 100 nm -10
$\mu$m), Brownian thermal fluctuation forces are necessarily important and
these stochastic forces can randomize passively-steered trajectories.
  Here we examine theoretically the stability of boundary guided motion of
micromotors along infinite planar walls to mechanical disturbances and to
Brownian forces. Our aim is to understand under what conditions this passively
guided motion is stable. We choose a locomotor design in which spherical
colloids are partially coated with a catalytic cap that reacts with solute to
produce a product. The product is repelled from the particle surface, causing
the particle to move with the inert face at the front (autonomous motion via
self-diffusiophoresis). When propelled towards a planar wall, deterministic
hydrodynamic studies demonstrate that these locomotors can exhibit, for large
enough cap sizes, steady trajectories in which the particle either skims
unidirectionally along the surface at a constant distance from the wall, or
becomes stationary. We first investigate the linear hydrodynamic stability of
these states by expanding the equations of motion about the states, and find
that linear perturbations decay exponentially in time. We then study the
effects of thermal fluctuations by formulating a Langevin equation for the
particle motion which includes the Brownian stochastic force...

that may not reveal the physical quantities involved and their influence on the
function being studied. In this paper the author models the approach to
equilibrium function by a method that allows the physical quantities to be
defined beforehand, allows their influence to be studied, and can be used to
predict how each physical quantity affects approach to equilibrium. Methods: An
ordinary differential equation (ODE) is used to model the approach to
equilibrium function for the case where collimation is changed at fixed
detector size. A parallel model is used to study the approach to equilibrium as
a function of detector size for fixed collimation. Both models are validated by
experimental measurements in a 60cm body phantom. Influence of detector size is
simulated by using leaded sleeves of varying sizes wrapped around a 100mm
pencil chamber. This creates sleeve gaps of 10 - 60mm around the chamber. A
100mm detector size is the pencil chamber without a leaded sleeve. Results:
Model accurately describes the experimental data for the cases studied. Except
for the smallest collimation of 5mm, linear regression analysis shows good
correlation between data and model according to the R^2 values at all
collimations. Further analysis of the model reveals minimum detector size that
will integrate 98% of the signal for a given collimation is, d=4.95L.
Additional analysis shows the minimum collimation at which a given detector
will collect 98% of the signal is, L=5.49d. Conclusion: Modeling by
differential equations is an accurate method for the approach to equilibrium
function, and has advantages over curve fitting methods.

state spaces is a challenging problem. The performance of standard RL
algorithms degrades drastically with the dimensionality of state space.
However, in practice, these large MDPs typically incorporate a latent or hidden
low-dimensional structure. In this paper, we study the setting of
rich-observation Markov decision processes (ROMDP), where there are a small
number of hidden states which possess an injective mapping to the observation
states. In other words, every observation state is generated through a single
hidden state, and this mapping is unknown a priori. We introduce a spectral
decomposition method that consistently learns this mapping, and more
importantly, achieves it with low regret. The estimated mapping is integrated
into an optimistic RL algorithm (UCRL), which operates on the estimated hidden
space. We derive finite-time regret bounds for our algorithm with a weak
dependence on the dimensionality of the observed space. In fact, our algorithm
asymptotically achieves the same average regret as the oracle UCRL algorithm,
which has the knowledge of the mapping from hidden to observed spaces. Thus, we
derive an efficient spectral RL algorithm for ROMDPs.

couplings, which describe all symmetry-allowed interactions between low-energy
fermions. Despite that the number of the couplings is large, we argue that
there are only two stable fixed trajectories of the RG flow and one weakly
unstable fixed trajectory with a single unstable direction. Each fixed
trajectory has a finite basin of attraction in the space of initial system
parameters. On the stable trajectories, either interactions involving only
$d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ or only $d_{xy}$ orbital components on the electron
pockets dominate, while on the weakly unstable trajectory interactions
involving $d_{xz}$ ($d_{yz}$) and $d_{xy}$ orbital states on the electron
pockets remain comparable. The behavior along the two stable fixed trajectories
has been analyzed earlier [A.V. Chubukov, M. Khodas, and R.M. Fernandes,
arXiv:1602.05503]. Here we focus on the system behavior along the weakly
unstable trajectory and apply the results to FeSe. We find, based on the
analysis of susceptibilities along this trajectory, that the leading
instability upon lowering the temperature is towards a {\it three-component}
d-wave orbital nematic order. Two components are the differences between
fermionic densities on $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals on hole pockets and on
electron pockets, and the third one is the difference between the densities of
$d_{xy}$ orbitals on the two electron pockets. We argue that this order is
consistent with the splitting of band degeneracies, observed in recent
photoemission data on FeSe by A. Fedorov et al [arXiv:1606.03022].

highly conducting fluids. Within the standard Sweet-Parker model, this process
would be too slow to explain observations (e.g. solar flares). In reality, the
process must be ubiquitous as astrophysical fluids are magnetized and motions
of fluid elements necessarily entail crossing of magnetic frozen-in field lines
and magnetic reconnection. In the presence of turbulence, the reconnection is
independent of microscopic plasma properties, and may be much faster than
previously thought, as proposed in Lazarian & Vishniac (1999) and tested in
Kowal et al. (2009, 2012). However, the considered turbulence in the
Lazarian-Vishniac model was imposed externally. In this work we consider
reconnection-driven magnetized turbulence in realistic three-dimensional
geometry initiated by stochastic noise. We demonstrate through numerical
simulations that the stochastic reconnection is able to self-generate
turbulence through interactions between its outflows. We analyze the
statistical properties of velocity fluctuations using power spectra and
anisotropy scaling, which demonstrates that the reconnection produces
Kolmogorov-like turbulence, compatible with Goldreich-Sridhar (1995) model.
Anisotropy statistics are, however, strongly affected by the dynamics of
reconnection outflows. Once the broad turbulent region is formed, the typical
anisotropy scaling $l_\parallel \propto l_\perp^{2/3}$ is formed, especially
for high resolution models, were the broader range of scales is available. The
decay of reconnection outflows to turbulent-like fluctuations, characterized by
different anisotropy scalings, strongly depends on $\beta$ plasma. Moreover,
the estimated reconnection rates are weakly dependent on the resolution,
suggesting that no external processes are required to make reconnection fast.

the simulation results crucially depend on the quality of the potential being

transferable interatomic potentials by matching the forces computed by the
potential as closely as possible, with those obtained from first principles
calculations. The potfit program is an implementation of the force-matching
method that optimizes the potential parameters using a global minimization
algorithm followed by a local minimization polish. We extended potfit in two
ways. First, we adapted the code to be compliant with the KIM Application
Programming Interface (API) standard (part of the Knowledgebase of Interatomic
Models Project). This makes it possible to use potfit to fit many KIM potential
models, not just those prebuilt into the potfit code. Second, we incorporated
the geodesic Levenberg--Marquardt (LM) minimization algorithm into potfit as a
new local minimization algorithm. The extended potfit was tested by generating
a training set using the KIM Environment-Dependent Interatomic Potential (EDIP)
model for silicon and using potfit to recover the potential parameters from
different initial guesses. The results show that EDIP is a ""sloppy model"" in
the sense that its predictions are insensitive to some of its parameters, which
makes fitting more difficult. We find that the geodesic LM algorithm is
particularly efficient for this case. The extended potfit code is the first
step in developing a KIM-based fitting framework for interatomic potentials for
bulk and two dimensional materials. The code is available for download via

density above 100mJy at 500{\mu}m extracted from the Herschel Astrophysical
Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS), over an area of 600 square degrees.
Available imaging and spectroscopic data allow us to confirm the strong lensing
in 20 cases and to reject it in one case. For other 8 objects the lensing
scenario is strongly supported by the presence of two sources along the same
line of sight with distinct photometric redshifts. The remaining objects await
more follow-up observations to confirm their nature. The lenses and the
background sources have median redshifts z_L = 0.6 and z_S = 2.5, respectively,
and are observed out to z_L = 1.2 and z_S = 4.2. We measure the number counts
of candidate lensed galaxies at 500{\mu}m and compare them with theoretical
predictions, finding a good agreement for a maximum magnification of the
background sources in the range 10-20. These values are consistent with the
magnification factors derived from the lens modelling of individual systems.
The catalogue presented here provides sub- mm bright targets for follow-up
observations aimed at exploiting gravitational lensing to study with
un-precedented details the morphological and dynamical properties of dusty star
forming regions in z >~ 1.5 galaxies.

inequality describing the support function of positive robust forward invariant
tubes, which can be used to construct a variety of tube-based model predictive

tractable and their complexity scales linearly with the length of the

solely on the accuracy of the set parameterization. The proposed approach is
then used to construct a robust MPC scheme based on tubes with ellipsoidal
cross-sections. This ellipsoidal MPC scheme is based on solving an optimal
control problem under linear matrix inequality constraints. We illustrate these
results with the numerical case study of a spring-mass-damper system.

from a granular bed is experimentally studied. Using a very precise creep
meter, geometry-dependent granular frictional constitutive law is particularly
examined. In some previous works, a dimensionless number
$I=\dot{\gamma}D_g/\sqrt{p/\rho_g}$ has been used to characterize granular
frictional constitutive laws, where $\dot{\gamma}$, $D_g$, $p$, and $\rho_g$
are the shear strain rate, grain diameter, confining pressure, and bulk density
of granular bed, respectively. It has been considered that granular frictional
constitutive law expressed by $I$ is universal (almost geometry-independent) in
dense flow regime. In this study, however, we find that the geometry of the
system is much more crucial to characterize granular friction in a very slow
withdrawing regime. Specifically, the ratio between rod and grain diameters
must be an essential parameter to describe the granular frictional constitutive
law. Physical meaning of the geometry-dependent constitutive law is discussed
on the basis of grains-contact-number dependence of granular behavior.

$Ln$O$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$ ($Ln$ = La, Nd) at ambient pressure (tetragonal
structure) and high pressure (HP) (monoclinic structure) have been investigated
via electrical resistivity measurements at various magnetic fields up to 8.5 T.
The $H_{c2}$($T$) curves for all the samples show an uncharacteristic concave
upward curvature at temperatures below $T_c$, which cannot be described by the
conventional one-band Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory. For the
LaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$ sample under HP, as temperature is decreased, the
upper critical field $H_{onset}$, estimated from the onset of the
superconducting transitions, increases slowly between 4.9 and 5.8 T compared
with the slope of $H_{onset}$($T$) below 4.9 T and above 5.8 T. This anomalous
behavior reveals a remarkable similarity in superconductivity between
LaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$ samples measured under HP and synthesized under
HP, although the crystal structures of the two samples were reported to be
different. The experimental results support the idea that local atomic
environment, which can be tuned by applying external pressure and can be
quenched to ambient pressure via high temperature-pressure annealing, is
possibly more essential to the enhancement of $T_c$ for BiS$_2$-based
superconductors than the structural phase transition. On the other hand, such
anomalous behavior is very subtle in the case of NdO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$
under HP, suggesting that the anisotropy of the upper critical field in the
$ab$-plane and the possible lattice deformation induced by external pressure is
weak. This explains why the pressure-induced enhancement of $T_c$ for
NdO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$ is not as large as that for
LaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$.

granular-flow state is acquired by a high-speed camera. The bulk discharge-flow

recipient but carries the risk of serious post-operative complications, such as
septic shock and organ rejection. The probability of a successful transplant
depends in a very subtle fashion on compatibility between the donor and the
recipient but current medical practice is short of domain knowledge regarding
the complex nature of recipient-donor compatibility. Hence a data-driven
approach for learning compatibility has the potential for significant
improvements in match quality. This paper proposes a novel system
(ConfidentMatch) that is trained using data from electronic health records.
ConfidentMatch predicts the success of an organ transplant (in terms of the 3
year survival rates) on the basis of clinical and demographic traits of the
donor and recipient. ConfidentMatch captures the heterogeneity of the donor and
recipient traits by optimally dividing the feature space into clusters and
constructing different optimal predictive models to each cluster. The system
controls the complexity of the learned predictive model in a way that allows
for assuring more granular and confident predictions for a larger number of
potential recipient-donor pairs, thereby ensuring that predictions are
""personalized"" and tailored to individual characteristics to the finest
possible granularity. Experiments conducted on the UNOS heart transplant
dataset show the superiority of the prognostic value of ConfidentMatch to other
competing benchmarks; ConfidentMatch can provide predictions of success with
95% confidence for 5,489 patients of a total population of 9,620 patients,
which corresponds to 410 more patients than the most competitive benchmark

the gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) theory, and use this to perform further
consistency checks of the recently conjectured Generalized FZZ (GFZZ) duality.

functions in the SL(2,R)/U(1) gauged WZW model that include n-2 oscillator
operators of the type described by Giveon, Itzhaki and Kutasov in reference

variables and the solutions are usually a set of discrete values. However, for
problems with a softly broken symmetry these methods often first find a point
which would be a solution if the symmetry were exact, and is thus an
approximate solution. After this, the solver needs to move in the direction of
the symmetry to find the actual solution, but that can be very difficult if
this direction is not a straight line in the space of variables. The solution
can often be found much more quickly by adding the generators of the softly
broken symmetry as auxiliary variables. This makes the number of variables more
than the equations and hence there will be a family of solutions, any one of
which would be acceptable. In this paper we present a procedure for finding
solutions in this case, and apply it to several simple examples and an
important problem in the physics of false vacuum decay. We also provide a
Mathematica package that implements Powell's hybrid method with the

convergence of DEC without relying on theories of other discretization methods,

solutions to the scalar Poisson problem in arbitrary dimensions converge
pointwise to the exact solution at least linearly with respect to the mesh

that the convergence is in fact of second order when the solution is
sufficiently regular. The problems of explaining the second order convergence,

we partition the graph and process the data in parallel across a cluster of
servers. State-of-the-art distributed graph querying systems place each graph
partition on a separate server, where query answering over that partition takes
place. This design has two major disadvantages. First, the router needs to
maintain a fixed routing table. Hence, these systems are less flexible with
respect to query routing, fault tolerance, and graph updates. Second, the graph
data must be partitioned such that the workload across the servers is balanced,
and the inter-machine communication is minimized. In addition, it is required
to update the existing partitions based on workload changes over graph nodes.
However, graph partitioning, online monitoring of workloads, and dynamically
updating the graph partitions are expensive. In this work, we mitigate both
these problems by decoupling graph storage from query processors, and by
developing smart routing strategies that improve the cache locality in query
processors. Since a query processor is no longer assigned any fixed part of the
graph, it is equally capable of handling any request, thus facilitating load
balancing and fault tolerance. On the other hand, due to our smart routing
strategies, query processors can effectively leverage their cache contents,
reducing the overall impact of how the graph is partitioned across storage
servers. A detailed experimental evaluation with several real-world, large
graph datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, gRouting - even with
simple hash partitioning of the data - achieves up to an order of magnitude
better query throughput compared to existing graph querying systems that employ
expensive graph partitioning and re-partitioning strategies.

  in Current Decision",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bias in perceptual decisions comes to pass when the advance knowledge
colludes with the current sensory evidence in support of the final choice. The
literature on decision making suggests two main hypotheses to account for this
kind of bias: internal bias signals are derived from (a) the residual of motor
response-related signals, and (b) the sensory information residues of the
decisions that we made in the past. Beside these hypotheses, a credible
hypothesis proposed by this study to explain the cause of decision biasing,
suggests that the decision-related neuron can make use of the residual
information of the previous decision for the current decision. We demonstrate
the validity of this assumption, first by performing behavioral experiments
based on the two-alternative forced-choice (TAFC) discrimination of motion
direction paradigms and then, we modified the pure drift-diffusion model (DDM)
based on accumulation to the bound mechanism to account for the sequential
effect. In both cases, the trace of the previous trial influences the current
decision. Results indicate that the probability of being correct in a current
decision increases if it is in line with the previously made decision. Also,
the model that keeps the previous decision information provides a better fit to
the behavioral data. Our findings suggest that the state of a decision variable
which is represented in the activity of decision-related neurons after crossing
the bound (in the previous decision) can accumulate with the decision variable
for the current decision in consecutive trials.

backgrounds and camera viewpoints. Traditional object detection methods often
perform worse under unconstrained video environments. To address this problem,
many modern approaches model deep hierarchical appearance representations for
object detection. Most of these methods require a timeconsuming training
process on large manual labelling sample set. In this paper, the proposed
framework takes a remarkably different direction to resolve the multi-scene
detection problem in a bottom-up fashion. First, a scene-specific objector is
obtained from a fully autonomous learning process triggered by marking several
bounding boxes around the object in the first video frame via a mouse. Here the
human labeled training data or a generic detector are not needed. Second, this
learning process is conveniently replicated many times in different
surveillance scenes and results in particular detectors under various camera
viewpoints. Thus, the proposed framework can be employed in multi-scene object
detection applications with minimal supervision. Obviously, the initial
scene-specific detector, initialized by several bounding boxes, exhibits poor
detection performance and is difficult to improve with traditional online
learning algorithm. Consequently, we propose Generative-Discriminative model to
partition detection response space and assign each partition an individual
descriptor that progressively achieves high classification accuracy. A novel
online gradual optimized process is proposed to optimize the
Generative-Discriminative model and focus on the hard samples.Experimental
results on six video datasets show our approach achieves comparable performance
to robust supervised methods, and outperforms the state of the art
self-learning methods under varying imaging conditions.

spectra and the X-ray burst spectra in a broad spectral range. Methods. We
performed spectral modeling of the persistent emission and the X-ray burst
emission of 4U 1728-34 using data from the INTEGRAL JEM-X and IBIS/ISGRI
instruments. Results. We constructed a hardness intensity diagram to track
spectral state variations. In the soft state the energy spectra are
characterized by two thermal components - likely from the accretion disc and
the boundary/spreading layer - together with a weak hard X-ray tail that we
detect in 4U 1728-34 for the first time in the 40 to 80 keV range. In the hard
state the source is detected up to 200 keV and the spectrum can be described by
a thermal Comptonization model plus an additional component: either a powerlaw
tail or reflection. By stacking 123 X-ray bursts in the hard state, we detect
emission up to 80 keV during the X-ray bursts. We find that during the bursts
the emission above 40 keV decreases by a factor of about three with respect to
the persistent emission level. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the
enhanced X-ray burst emission changes the spectral properties of the accretion
disc in the hard state. The likely cause is an X-ray burst induced cooling of
the electrons in the inner hot flow near the neutron star.

monitoring bright blazars at TeV energies providing important pre- and
post-flare information. For the first time, the data and lightcurves from
H.E.S.S. and FACT are compared. These contemporaneous observations allow for a
better characterization of the source emission. In a multiwavelength context,
more precise correlation studies between VHE and lower energies are possible
thanks to the dense sampling of the FACT observations. The hard intrinsic
spectrum detected by H.E.S.S. during the flare allows the derivation of strong
constraints on the scale of Lorentz invariance violation via the non-detection
of EBL opacity modifications and from time-of-flight studies.

of causality. Here, to look further into the potentialities and difficulties of
$f(\mathcal{R})$ theories, we examine whether they admit G\""odel-type solutions
for well-motivated matter source. We first show that under certain conditions
on the matter sources the problem of finding out space-time homogeneous
solutions in $f(\mathcal{R})$ theories reduces to the problem of determining
solutions of Einstein's field equations with a cosmological constant. Employing
this far-reaching result, we determine a general G\""odel-type whose matter
source is a combination of a scalar with an electromagnetic field plus a
perfect fluid. This general G\""odel-type solution contains special solutions in
which the essential parameter $m^2$ can be $m^{2} > 0$, $m=0$, and $m^{2} < 0$,
covering thus all classes of homogeneous G\""odel-type spacetimes. This general
solution also contains all previously known solution as special cases. The bare
existence of these G\""odel-type solutions makes apparent that hybrid
metric-Palatini gravity does not remedy causal anomaly in the form of closed
timelike curves that are permitted in general relativity.

quantized. As a direct consequence, measurement sensitivities are fundamentally
limited by quantization noise, or just `quantum noise' in short. Furthermore,
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle demands measurement back-action for some
observables of a system if they are measured repeatedly. In both respects,
squeezed states are of high interest since they show a `squeezed' uncertainty,
which can be used to improve the sensitivity of measurement devices beyond the
usual quantum noise limits including those impacted by quantum back-action
noise. Squeezed states of light can be produced with nonlinear optics, and a
large variety of proof-of-principle experiments were performed in past decades.
As an actual application, squeezed light has now been used for several years to
improve the measurement sensitivity of GEO600 -- a laser interferometer built
for the detection of gravitational waves. Given this success, squeezed light is
likely to significantly contribute to the new field of gravitational-wave
astronomy. This Review revisits the concept of squeezed states and two-mode
squeezed states of light, with a focus on experimental observations. The
distinct properties of squeezed states displayed in quadrature phase-space as
well as in the photon number representation are described. The role of the
light's quantum noise in laser interferometers is summarized and the actual
application of squeezed states in these measurement devices is reviewed.

symmetry acting on fermions and scalars prevents perturbative mass corrections.
In the phase where fermions are massless (Wigner phase) the Yukawa coupling can
be tuned to a critical value at which chiral transformations acting on fermions
only become a symmetry of the theory (up to cutoff effects). In the
Nambu-Goldstone phase of the critical theory a fermion mass term of dynamical

criterion is established for the state of an arbitrary qubit pair, expressed
first with probability amplitudes and secondly with probabilities. It is
stressed that the concept of statistical independence of the sources, widely

theories were used to analyze the scattering data from hexagonal arrays,
revealing how bulk modulus, as well as how the deflection length depends on the
applied osmotic stress. Scattering data from aligned flagellar bundles
confirmed the predicated structure-factor scattering peak line-shape.
Quantitative analysis of the measured equation of state of the bundles revealed
the contributions of the electrostatic, hydration, and elastic interactions to
the intermolecular interactions associated with bundling of straight
semi-flexible flagellar filaments.}%1 {Insert Received for publication Date and

may have two forms: time-symmetric, which is conventional, and
time-antisymmetric, which is suggested in the present work. The symmetric and
antisymmetric forms correspond to symmetric and antisymmetric extensions of
thermodynamics from matter to antimatter --- this is demonstrated by proving
the corresponding H-theorem. The two forms are based on the thermodynamic
similarity of matter and antimatter and differ only in the directions of
thermodynamic time for matter and antimatter (the same in the time-symmetric
case and the opposite in the time-antisymmetric case). We demonstrate that,
while the symmetric form of PME predicts an equi-balance between matter and
antimatter, the antisymmetric form of PME favours full conversion of antimatter
into matter. At this stage, it is impossible to make an experimentally
justified choice in favour of the symmetric or antisymmetric versions of
thermodynamics since we have no experience of thermodynamic properties of
macroscopic objects made of antimatter, but experiments of this kind may become
possible in the future.

Weakly Supervised Learning where the goal is to learn simultaneously from
weakly and strongly labeled data. Strongly labeled data can be simply
understood as fully supervised data where all labeled instances are available.
In weakly supervised learning only data is weakly labeled which prevents one
from directly applying supervised learning methods. Our proposed framework is
motivated by the fact that a small amount of strongly labeled data can give
considerable improvement over only weakly supervised learning. The primary
problem domain focus of this paper is acoustic event and scene detection in
audio recordings. We first propose a naive formulation for leveraging labeled
data in both forms. We then propose a more general framework for Supervised and
Weakly Supervised Learning (SWSL). Based on this general framework, we propose
a graph based approach for SWSL. Our main method is based on manifold
regularization on graphs in which we show that the unified learning can be
formulated as a constraint optimization problem which can be solved by
iterative concave-convex procedure (CCCP). Our experiments show that our
proposed framework can address several concerns of audio content analysis using
weakly labeled data.

  overlap with arXiv:1610.00992",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The concept of a physical space, which actualizes Euclidean geometry, is not
confined to the statics of solids but extensible to the phenomena where
Newtonian mechanics is valid, defining its concept of time. The laws of
propagation of electromagnetic disturbances modify Newtonian formalism for
sufficiently fast free motions within each spatial domain of its validity for
slow motions and introduce the extended concept of time by uniting those of
Newtonian which can exist in different spatial domains of their validity.
  A boost direction for a pair of physical spaces is that spatial direction in
one of the spaces along which the other space moves. Free motions of point
particles make an instrumentation for identifying the boost direction as well
as events on a straight line along that direction. The concept of a boost
direction secures the physics-based formulation of the basic relativity
effects, which eventually results in the relation between two arbitrary spaces
in terms of their position vectors and time of a given event.
  The obtained transformation rules for the components of the position vector
differ from the vector-like relationship known in the literature because the
latter actually deals with column vectors made of Cartesian coordinates of true
vectors and appears identical to a coordinate transformation referred to as a
boost.
  Within the physics-based approach, the transformation of coordinates implies
specifying coordinate systems in each frame in terms of physical
objects/directions. This yields a logically consistent and physically
meaningful presentation of the coordinate transformations commonly exploited in
the special relativity theory, which makes manifestations of those
transformations evident. Specifically, for a Cartesian coordinate system
subjected to a boost, the coordinate-free technique of reasoning allows one to
evaluate its apparent distortion easily.
