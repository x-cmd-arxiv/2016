immersed into a fully polarized spin-up Fermi sea with a weak attraction is
dressed by the surrounding spin-up fermions to form the one-dimensional analog
of a polaron. As the attraction becomes strong, the spin-down fermion binds
with one spin-up fermion to form a tightly bound molecule. Throughout the whole
interaction regime, a crossover from the polaron to a molecule state is fully
demonstrated through exact results of the excitation spectrum, the effective
mass, binding energy and kinetic energy. Furthermore, a clear distinction
between the polaron and molecule is conceived by the probability distribution,
single particle reduced density matrix and density-density correlations, which
are calculated directly from the Bethe ansatz wave function. Such a
polaron-molecule crossover presents a universal nature of an impurity immersed
into a fermionic medium with an attraction in one dimension.

known ${\gamma}$-ray pulsars has increased immensely to over 200, many of which
are also visible in the radio and X-ray bands. Seyffert et al. (2011)
demonstrated how constraints on the viewing geometries of some of these pulsars
could be obtained by comparing their observed radio and ${\gamma}$-ray light
curves by eye to light curves from geometric models. While these constraints
compare reasonably well with those yielded by more rigorous single-wavelength
approaches, they are still a somewhat subjective representation of how well the
models reproduce the observed radio and ${\gamma}$-ray light curves.
Constructing a more rigorous approach is, however, made difficult by the large
uncertainties associated with the ${\gamma}$-ray light curves as compared to
those associated with the radio light curves. Naively applying a
${\chi}^{2}$-like goodness-of-fit test to both bands invariably results in
constraints dictated by the radio light curves. A number of approaches have
been proposed to address this issue. In this paper we investigate these
approaches and evaluate the results they yield. Based on what we learn, we
implement our own version of a goodness-of-fit test, which we then use to
investigate the behaviour of the geometric models in multi-dimensional phase
space.

In this paper, an algorithm is presented that computes the transformation to a

the usual integration-by-parts reduction techniques. The algorithm requires the
existence of a rational transformation to a canonical basis, but is otherwise
completely agnostic about the differential equation. In particular, it is
applicable to problems involving multiple scales and allows for a rational

galaxies is related to the orbital decay of globular clusters (GCs) and their
subsequent merging, though alternative theories are currently debated. The
availability of high-quality data for GCs structural and orbital parameters
allow to test different nuclear star cluster formation scenarios. The Fornax
dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy is the heaviest satellite of the Milky Way and
it is the only known dwarf spheroidal hosting 5 GCs, whereas there are no clear
signatures for the presence of a central massive black hole. For this reason,
it represents a suited place to study the orbital decay process in dwarf
galaxies. In this paper we model the future evolution of the Fornax GCs
simulating them and the host galaxy by means of direct $N$-body simulations.
Our simulations take in account also the gravitational field generated by the
Milky Way. We found that if the Fornax galaxy is embedded in a standard Cold
Dark Matter Halo, the nuclear cluster formation would be significantly hampered
by the high central galactic mass density. In this context, we discuss the
possibility that infalling GCs drive the flattening of the galactic density
profile, giving a possible alternative explanation to the so-called cusp/core
problem. Moreover, we briefly discuss the link between GC infall process and
the absence of massive black holes in the centre of dSphs.

of the central 5kpc for the two central brightest-cluster galaxies (BCGs)

unresolved data for NGC4873 as a low-$\sigma_*$ control. We present radial
measurements of the IMF-sensitive features sodium NaI$_{\rm{SDSS}}$, calcium
triplet CaT and iron-hydride FeH0.99, along with the magnesium MgI0.88 and
titanium oxide TiO0.89 features. We employ two separate methods for both
telluric correction and sky-subtraction around the faint FeH feature to verify
our analysis. Within NGC4889 we find strong gradients of NaI$_{\rm{SDSS}}$ and
CaT but a flat FeH profile, which from comparing to stellar population
synthesis models, suggests an old, $\alpha$-enhanced population with a
Chabrier, or even bottom-light IMF. The age and abundance is in line with
previous studies but the normal IMF is in contrast to recent results suggesting
an increased IMF slope with increased velocity dispersion. We measure flat
NaI$_{\rm{SDSS}}$ and FeH profiles within NGC4874 and determine an old,
possibly slightly $\alpha$-enhanced and Chabrier IMF population. We find an
$\alpha$-enhanced, Chabrier IMF population in NGC4873. Within NGC4839 we
measure both strong NaI$_{\rm{SDSS}}$ and strong FeH, although with a large
systematic uncertainty, suggesting a possible heavier IMF. The IMFs we infer
for these galaxies are supported by published dynamical modelling. We stress
that IMF constraints should be corroborated by further spectral coverage and
independent methods on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis.

detection is not asymptotically trivial, that $ {\bf L}_\alpha $ can be well
approximated by a more tractable random matrix which falls in the family of
spiked random matrices. The analysis of this equivalent spiked random matrix
allows us to improve spectral methods for community detection and assess their

of an optimal value $ \alpha_{\rm opt} $ of the parameter $ \alpha $ for which
the detection of communities is best ensured and we provide an on-line
estimation of $ \alpha_{\rm opt} $ only based on the knowledge of the graph
adjacency matrix. Unlike classical spectral methods for community detection
where clustering is performed on the eigenvectors associated with extreme
eigenvalues, we show through our theoretical analysis that a regularization
should instead be performed on those eigenvectors prior to clustering in
heterogeneous graphs. Finally, through a deeper study of the regularized
eigenvectors used for clustering, we assess the performances of our new

performing measurements on an uncharacterized physical system can be used to
infer its underlying dimension in a device-independent way both in the
classical and quantum setting. We analyze several aspects of the structure of
the sets of probability distributions corresponding to a certain dimension
taking into account whether shared randomness is available as a resource or
not. We first consider the so-called prepare-and-measure scenario. We show that
quantumness and shared randomness are not comparable resources. That is, on the
one hand, there exist behaviours that require a quantum system of arbitrarily
large dimension in order to be observed while they can be reproduced with a
classical physical system of minimal dimension together with shared randomness.
On the other hand, there exist behaviours which require exponentially larger
dimensions classically than quantumly even if the former is supplemented with
shared randomness. We also show that in the absence of shared randomness, the
sets corresponding to a sufficiently small dimension are negligible
(zero-measure and nowhere dense) both classically and quantumly. This is in
sharp contrast to the situation in which this resource is available and
explains the exceptional robustness of dimension witnesses in the setting in
which devices can be taken to be uncorrelated. We finally consider the Bell
scenario in the absence of shared randomness and prove some non-convexity and
negligibility properties of these sets for sufficiently small dimensions. This
shows again the enormous difference induced by the availability or not of this
resource.

factors, ranging from personal stakes to the properties of the interaction
network. Diverse activity patterns thus have to be taken into account when
studying the evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas. Here we study the
weak prisoner's dilemma game, where the activity of each player is determined
in a probabilistic manner either by its degree or by its payoff. While
degree-correlated activity introduces cascading failures of cooperation that
are particularly severe on scale-free networks with frequently inactive hubs,
payoff-correlated activity provides a more nuanced activity profile, which
ultimately hinders systemic breakdowns of cooperation. To determine optimal
conditions for the evolution of cooperation, we introduce an exponential decay
to payoff-correlated activity that determines how fast the activity of a player
returns to its default state. We show that there exists an intermediate decay
rate, at which the resolution of the social dilemma is optimal. This can be
explained by the emerging activity patterns of players, where the inactivity of
hubs is compensated effectively by the increased activity of average-degree
players, who through their collective influence in the network sustain a higher
level of cooperation. The sudden drops in the fraction of cooperators observed
with degree-correlated activity therefore vanish, and so does the need for the
lengthy spatiotemporal reorganization of compact cooperative clusters. The
absence of such asymmetric dynamic instabilities thus leads to an optimal
resolution of social dilemmas, especially when the conditions for the evolution
of cooperation are strongly adverse.

representing lattice gases in statistical physics and independent sets in
discrete mathematics and computer science. On finite graphs, we are given a
parameter $\lambda$, and an independent set $I$ arises with probability
proportional to $\lambda^{|I|}$. On infinite graphs a Gibbs measure is defined
as a suitable limit with the correct conditional probabilities, and we are
interested in determining when this limit is unique and when there is phase
coexistence, i.e., existence of multiple Gibbs measures.
  It has long been conjectured that on ${\mathbb Z}^2$ this model has a
critical value $\lambda_c \approx 3.796$ with the property that if $\lambda <
\lambda_c$ then it exhibits uniqueness of phase, while if $\lambda > \lambda_c$
then there is phase coexistence. Much of the work to date on this problem has
focused on the regime of uniqueness, with the state of the art being recent
work of Sinclair, Srivastava, \v{S}tefankovi\v{c} and Yin showing that there is
a unique Gibbs measure for all $\lambda < 2.538$. Here we give the first
non-trivial result in the other direction, showing that there are multiple
Gibbs measures for all $\lambda > 5.3506$. There is some potential for lowering
this bound, but with the methods we are using we cannot hope to replace
$5.3506$ with anything below about $4.8771$.
  Our proof begins along the lines of the standard Peierls argument, but we add
two innovations. First, following ideas of Koteck\'y and Randall, we construct
an event that distinguishes two boundary conditions and always has long
contours associated with it, obviating the need to accurately enumerate short
contours. Second, we obtain improved bounds on the number of contours by
relating them to a new class of self-avoiding walks on an oriented version of

applications. Traditional implementations of Strassen-like fast matrix
multiplication (FMM) algorithms often do not perform well except for very large
matrix sizes, due to the increased cost of memory movement, which is
particularly noticeable for non-square matrices. Such implementations also
require considerable workspace and modifications to the standard BLAS
interface. We propose a code generator framework to automatically implement a
large family of FMM algorithms suitable for multiplications of arbitrary matrix
sizes and shapes. By representing FMM with a triple of matrices [U,V,W] that
capture the linear combinations of submatrices that are formed, we can use the
Kronecker product to define a multi-level representation of Strassen-like
algorithms. Incorporating the matrix additions that must be performed for
Strassen-like algorithms into the inherent packing and micro-kernel operations
inside GEMM avoids extra workspace and reduces the cost of memory movement.
Adopting the same loop structures as high-performance GEMM implementations
allows parallelization of all FMM algorithms with simple but efficient data
parallelism without the overhead of task parallelism. We present a simple
performance model for general FMM algorithms and compare actual performance of
20+ FMM algorithms to modeled predictions. Our implementations demonstrate a
performance benefit over conventional GEMM on single core and multi-core
systems. This study shows that Strassen-like fast matrix multiplication can be
incorporated into libraries for practical use.

binary black hole coalescences (BBH) GW150914 and GW151226 by the LIGO
instruments. These systems allowed for the first direct measurement of masses
and spins of black holes. The component masses in each of the systems have been
estimated with uncertainties of over 10\%, with only weak constraints on the
spin magnitude and orientation. In this paper we show how these uncertainties
will be typical for this type of source when using advanced detectors. Focusing
in particular on heavy BBH of masses similar to GW150914, we find that typical
uncertainties in the estimation of the source-frame component masses will be
around 40\%. We also find that for most events the magnitude of the component
spins will be estimated poorly: for only 10\% of the systems the uncertainties
in the spin magnitude of the primary (secondary) BH will be below 0.7 (0.8).
Conversely, the effective spin along the angular momentum can be estimated more
precisely than either spins, with uncertainties below 0.16 for 10\% of the
systems. We also quantify how often large or negligible primary spins can be
excluded, and how often the sign of the effective spin can be measured. We show
how the angle between the spin and the orbital angular momentum can only seldom
be measured with uncertainties below 60$^\circ$. We then investigate how the
measurement of spin parameters depends on the inclination angle and the total
mass of the source. We find that when precession is present, uncertainties are
smaller for systems observed close to edge-on. Contrarily to what happens for
low-mass, inspiral dominated, sources, for heavy BBH we find that large spins
aligned with the orbital angular momentum can be measured with small
uncertainty. We also show how spin uncertainties increase with the total mass.

publicly released by the WMAP and Planck satellites on the estimation of
cosmological parameters of the $\Lambda$CDM model. To complement large-angle
polarization, we consider the high-resolution CMB datasets from either WMAP or
Planck, as well as CMB lensing as traced by Planck. In the case of WMAP, we
compute the large-angle polarization likelihood starting over from
low-resolution frequency maps and their covariance matrices, and perform our
own foreground mitigation technique, which includes as a possible alternative
Planck 353 GHz data to trace polarized dust. We find that the latter choice
induces a downward shift in the optical depth $\tau$, of order ~$2\sigma$,
robust to the choice of the complementary high-l dataset. When the Planck 353
GHz is consistently used to minimize polarized dust emission, WMAP and Planck
70 GHz large-angle polarization data are in remarkable agreement: by combining
them we find $\tau = 0.066 ^{+0.012}_{-0.013}$, again very stable against the
particular choice for high-$\ell$ data. We find that the amplitude of
primordial fluctuations $A_s$, notoriously degenerate with $\tau$, is the
parameter second most affected by the assumptions on polarized dust removal,
but the other parameters are also affected, typically between $0.5$ and
$1\sigma$. In particular, cleaning dust with \planck's 353 GHz data imposes a
$1\sigma$ downward shift in the value of the Hubble constant $H_0$,
significantly contributing to the tension reported between CMB based and direct
measurements of $H_0$. On the other hand, we find that the appearance of the
so-called low $\ell$ anomaly, a well-known tension between the high- and
low-resolution CMB anisotropy amplitude, is not significantly affected by the
details of large-angle polarization, or by the particular high-$\ell$ dataset
employed.

attention in recent research. Current literature on tensor completion primarily
focuses on recovery from a set of uniformly randomly measured entries, and the
required number of measurements to achieve recovery is not guaranteed to be
optimal. In addition, the implementation of some previous methods is NP-hard.
In this article, we propose a framework for low-rank tensor completion via a
novel tensor measurement scheme we name Cross. The proposed procedure is
efficient and easy to implement. In particular, we show that a third order
tensor of Tucker rank-$(r_1, r_2, r_3)$ in $p_1$-by-$p_2$-by-$p_3$ dimensional

+ r_3(p_3-r_3)$ noiseless measurements, which matches the sample complexity
lower-bound. In the case of noisy measurements, we also develop a theoretical
upper bound and the matching minimax lower bound for recovery error over
certain classes of low-rank tensors for the proposed procedure. The results can
be further extended to fourth or higher-order tensors. Simulation studies show
that the method performs well under a variety of settings. Finally, the
procedure is illustrated through a real dataset in neuroimaging.

prominent technologies of the next generation wireless standards, such as 5G,
due to the large gains in energy and spectral efficiency that can be achieved.
In the asymptotic condition of infinite number of antennas at the base station
(BS), the performance bottleneck of these systems is due to the pilot
contamination effect, i.e., the directional interference arising from users in
adjacent cells that reuse the same set of orthogonal training sequences, and
thus the interference seen by each user is determined by the pilot sequence
assigned to him. We show in this paper that the system performance can be
improved by appropriately assigning the pilot sequences to the users, in the
so-called pilot allocation scheme. Depending on the optimization metric
adopted, it is more advantageous to a user with certain long- term fading
coefficient be assigned to a specific pilot sequence, whose interference can be
completely estimated in advance by the BS by only knowing the long term fading
coefficients of users in adjacent cells. Besides, if the objective is to
maximize the number of users with a target quality of service, we have shown
that the pilot allocation schemes can be combined with power control
algorithms, resulting in much more improvements for the system. For unitary
frequency reuse factor, we have found that the data throughput provided for 95%
of the users increases when applying power control algorithm from 134kbps to
1.461Mbps with no pilot allocation, while this performance gain provided by
power control changes from 793kbps to 6.743Mbps when pilot allocation is
employed. If the reuse factor increases to 3, a 95%-likely data throughput of
17.310Mbps can be assured when pilot allocation and power control are suitably

(at the half filling), we find that the vanishing of the nearest-neighbor
charge concurrence indicates the crossover from a partly-localized quantum
liquid to the Mott insulator. Spin concurrence remains nonzero at the
insulating phase, showing that the decopling of spin and charge degrees of
freedom may manifest itself by wavefunctions entangled in spin, but separable
in charge coordinates. At the quarter filling, the analysis for
$N\leqslant{}20$ shows that spin concurrence vanishes immediately when the
charge-energy gap obtained from the scaling with $1/N\rightarrow{}0$ vanishes,
constituting a finite-system version of the Mott transition. Analytic
derivations of the formulas expressing either charge or spin concurrence in
terms of ground-state correlation functions are also provided.

sort-merge joins, and user-requested output sorting. As GPUs are emerging as a
promising platform to accelerate various operations, sorting on GPUs becomes a
viable endeavour. Over the past few years, several improvements have been
proposed for sorting on GPUs, leading to the first radix sort implementations
that achieve a sorting rate of over one billion 32-bit keys per second. Yet,
state-of-the-art approaches are heavily memory bandwidth-bound, as they require
substantially more memory transfers than their CPU-based counterparts.
  Our work proposes a novel approach that almost halves the amount of memory
transfers and, therefore, considerably lifts the memory bandwidth limitation.
Being able to sort two gigabytes of eight-byte records in as little as 50
milliseconds, our approach achieves a 2.32-fold improvement over the
state-of-the-art GPU-based radix sort for uniform distributions, sustaining a
minimum speed-up of no less than a factor of 1.66 for skewed distributions.
  To address inputs that either do not reside on the GPU or exceed the
available device memory, we build on our efficient GPU sorting approach with a
pipelined heterogeneous sorting algorithm that mitigates the overhead
associated with PCIe data transfers. Comparing the end-to-end sorting
performance to the state-of-the-art CPU-based radix sort running 16 threads,
our heterogeneous approach achieves a 2.06-fold and a 1.53-fold improvement for
sorting 64 GB key-value pairs with a skewed and a uniform distribution,

use the microscopic theory to study the decay of such quasiparticle

backscattering of a Bogoliubov quasiparticle off the Fermi sea, where a
particle-hole pair is excited. For a low-momentum quasiparticle (phonon) of
momentum $q$, we find that the decay rate scales as $q^3$ provided $q$ is
smaller than the Fermi momentum $k_F$, while in the opposite case the decay
behaves as $q^2$. If the ratio of the masses of fermions and bosons equals to
the ratio of the boson-fermion and the boson-boson interaction strengths, the
decay rate changes dramatically. It scales as $q^7$ for $q<k_F$ while we find
$q^6$ scaling at $q>k_F$. For a high momentum Bogoliubov quasiparticle, we find
a constant decay rate for $q<k_F$, while it scales as $1/q$ for $q>k_F$. We
also find an analytic expression for the decay rate in the crossover region

mass cutoff parameterizations in order to probe the minimum and maximum BH
masses allowed by stellar evolution, respectively. We initially focus on the
heavier BH in each binary, to minimize model dependence. Taking into account
the experimental noise, the mass measurement errors and the uncertainty in the
redshift-dependence of the merger rate, we show that the mass function
parameters, as well as the total rate of merger events, can be measured to <10%
accuracy within a few years of advanced LIGO observations at its design

upper limit on the stellar mass which allows for BH formation and to confirm or
refute the currently observed mass gap between neutron stars and BHs. In order
to glean information on the progenitors of the merging BH binaries, we then
advocate the study of the two-dimensional mass distribution to constrain
parameters that describe the two-body system, such as the mass ratio between
the two BHs, in addition to the merger rate and mass function parameters. We
argue that several years of data collection can efficiently probe models of
binary formation, and show, as an example, that the hypothesis that some
gravitational-wave events may involve primordial black holes can be tested.
Finally, we point out that in order to maximize the constraining power of the

scattering process complicates the interpretation of Ly$\alpha$ spectra, but
also encodes a wealth of information about the structure and kinematics of
neutral gas in the galaxy. Modeling the Ly$\alpha$ line therefore allows us to
study tiny-scale features of the gas, even in the most distant galaxies.
Curiously, observed Ly$\alpha$ spectra can be modeled successfully with very
simple, homogeneous geometries (such as an expanding, spherical shell), whereas
more realistic, multiphase geometries often fail to reproduce the observed
spectra. This seems paradoxical since the gas in galaxies is known to be
multiphase. In this Letter, we show that spectra emerging from extremely clumpy
geometries with many clouds along the line of sight converge to the predictions

behavior of complex systems in numerous domains. An important long-standing
problem concerns the properties of the networks that optimize the dynamics with
respect to a given performance measure. Here we show that such optimization can
lead to sensitive dependence of the dynamics on the structure of the network.
Specifically, using diffusively coupled systems as examples, we demonstrate
that the stability of a dynamical state can exhibit sensitivity to unweighted
structural perturbations (i.e., link removals and node additions) for
undirected optimal networks and to weighted perturbations (i.e., small changes
in link weights) for directed optimal networks. As mechanisms underlying this
sensitivity, we identify discontinuous transitions occurring in the complement
of undirected optimal networks and the prevalence of eigenvector degeneracy in
directed optimal networks. These findings establish a unified characterization
of networks optimized for dynamical stability, which we illustrate using Turing
instability in activator-inhibitor systems, synchronization in power-grid
networks, network diffusion, and several other network processes. Our results
suggest that the network structure of a complex system operating near an
optimum can potentially be fine-tuned for a significantly enhanced stability
compared to what one might expect from simple extrapolation. On the other hand,
they also suggest constraints on how close to the optimum the system can be in
practice. Finally, the results have potential implications for biophysical
networks, which have evolved under the competing pressures of optimizing
fitness while remaining robust against perturbations.

similar to the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) soon after or during a dynamical

independent control of the total and relative charge density of two-component
fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states. In particular, a recent experiment on
bilayer graphene (BLG) observed a continuous transition between a compressible
and incompressible phase at total filling $\nu_T = \frac{1}{2}$ as charge is
transferred between the layers, with the remarkable property that the
incompressible phase has a finite interlayer polarizability. We argue that this
occurs because the topological order of $\nu_T = \frac{1}{2}$ systems supports
a novel type of interlayer exciton that carries Fermi statistics. If the
fermionic excitons are lower in energy than the conventional bosonic excitons
(i.e., electron-hole pairs), they can form an emergent neutral Fermi surface,
providing a possible explanation of an incompressible yet polarizable state at
$\nu_T = \frac{1}{2}$. We perform exact diagonalization studies which
demonstrate that fermionic excitons are indeed lower in energy than bosonic
excitons. This suggests that a ""topological exciton metal"" hidden inside a FQH
insulator may have been realized experimentally in BLG. We discuss several
detection schemes by which the topological exciton metal can be experimentally
probed.

and reverberant environments, using binaural recordings of an acoustic scene. A
Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is adopted, whose components correspond to all the
possible candidate source locations defined on a grid. After optimizing the
GMM-based objective function, given an observed set of binaural features, both
the number of sources and their locations are estimated by selecting the GMM
components with the largest priors. This is achieved by enforcing a sparse
solution, thus favoring a small number of speakers with respect to the large
number of initial candidate source locations. An entropy-based penalty term is
added to the likelihood, thus imposing sparsity over the set of GMM priors. In
addition, the direct-path relative transfer function (DP-RTF) is used to build
robust binaural features. The DP-RTF, recently proposed for single-source
localization, was shown to be robust to reverberations, since it encodes
inter-channel information corresponding to the direct-path of sound
propagation. In this paper, we extend the DP-RTF estimation to the case of
multiple sources. In the short-time Fourier transform domain, a consistency
test is proposed to check whether a set of consecutive frames is associated to
the same source or not. Reliable DP-RTF features are selected from the frames
that pass the consistency test to be used for source localization. Experiments
carried out using both simulation data and real data gathered with a robotic
head confirm the efficiency of the proposed multi-source localization method.

hydrodynamics. Here, we study the ciliary bands of starfish larvae, and
discover a beautiful pattern of slowly-evolving vortices that surrounds the
swimming animals. Closer inspection of the bands reveals unusual ciliary
""tangles"" analogous to topological defects that break up and re-form as the
animal adjusts its swimming stroke. Quantitative experiments and modeling
demonstrate that these vortices create a physical tradeoff between feeding and
swimming in heterogenous environments, which manifests as distinct flow
patterns or ""eigen-strokes"" representing each behavior---potentially
implicating neuronal control of cilia. This quantitative interplay between
larval form and hydrodynamic function may generalize to other invertebrates
with ciliary bands, and illustrates the potential effects of active boundary

Multi-Resolution Analysis (GMRA) provides a robust and computationally
efficient procedure to construct low-dimensional geometric approximations of

the geometric wavelet coefficients, leading to what we call adaptive GMRA
approximations. We show that these data-driven, empirical approximations
perform well, when the threshold is chosen as a suitable universal function of
the number of samples $n$, on a wide variety of measures $\rho$, that are
allowed to exhibit different regularity at different scales and locations,
thereby efficiently encoding data from more complex measures than those
supported on manifolds. These approximations yield a data-driven dictionary,
together with a fast transform mapping data to coefficients, and an inverse of
such a map. The algorithms for both the dictionary construction and the
transforms have complexity $C n \log n$ with the constant linear in $D$ and
exponential in $d$. Our work therefore establishes adaptive GMRA as a fast
dictionary learning algorithm with approximation guarantees. We include several

  It was empirically observed in He et al. (2015) that stacking more layers of
residual blocks with shortcut 2 results in smaller training error, while it is
not true for shortcut of length 1 or 3. We provide a theoretical explanation
for the uniqueness of shortcut 2.
  We show that with or without nonlinearities, by adding shortcuts that have
depth two, the condition number of the Hessian of the loss function at the zero
initial point is depth-invariant, which makes training very deep models no more
difficult than shallow ones. Shortcuts of higher depth result in an extremely
flat (high-order) stationary point initially, from which the optimization
algorithm is hard to escape. The shortcut 1, however, is essentially equivalent
to no shortcuts, which has a condition number exploding to infinity as the
number of layers grows. We further argue that as the number of layers tends to
infinity, it suffices to only look at the loss function at the zero initial
point.
  Extensive experiments are provided accompanying our theoretical results. We
show that initializing the network to small weights with shortcut 2 achieves
significantly better results than random Gaussian (Xavier) initialization,
orthogonal initialization, and shortcuts of deeper depth, from various
perspectives ranging from final loss, learning dynamics and stability, to the

acyclic graph (DAG) models are a popular class of models used for this purpose.
Gaussian DAG models introduce sparsity in the Cholesky factor of the inverse
covariance matrix, and the sparsity pattern in turn corresponds to specific

priors have been developed in recent years for Bayesian inference in DAG

establish strong graph selection consistency and establish posterior

range of core masses at various stages of evolution, mass locations of the main
nuclear burning shells, electron fraction profiles, mass fraction profiles,
burning lifetimes, stellar lifetimes, and compactness parameter at

generally find mass resolution has a larger impact on the variations than the

in determining the span of the variations for neon, oxygen and silicon burning.
Choice of mass resolution dominates the variations in the structure of the

deformations are measured with micrometer accuracy using the Free-Surface
Synthetic Schlieren method. We recover the two regimes of surface deformations
previously identified: the wrinkles regime at small wind velocity, resulting
from the viscous imprint on the liquid surface of the turbulent fluctuations in
the boundary layer, and the regular wave regime at large wind velocity. Below
the wave threshold, we find that the characteristic amplitude of the wrinkles
scales as $\nu^{-1/2} u^{* 3/2}$ over nearly the whole range of viscosities,
whereas their size are essentially unchanged. We propose a simple model for
this scaling, which compares well with the data. We finally show that the
critical friction velocity $u^*$ for the onset of regular waves slowly
increases with viscosity as $\nu^{0.2}$. Whereas the transition between
wrinkles and waves is smooth at small viscosity, including for water, it
becomes rather abrupt at large viscosity. Finally, a new regime is found at
$\nu > 100-200 \times 10^{-6}$~m$^2$~s$^{-1}$, characterized by a slow, nearly

point. We investigate the connection between the so-called principle
eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator and the existence of a topological
conjugacy between the nonlinear dynamics and its linearization in the
neighborhood of the fixed point. The principle eigenfunctions generate an
algebra of observables for the linear dynamics --- called the principle algebra
--- which can be used to generate a sequence of approximate conjugacy maps in
the same manner as it is done in normal form theory. Each element of the
principle algebra has an expansion into eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator
and composing an eigenfunction with one of the approximate topological
conjugacies gives an approximate eigenfunction of the Koopman operator
associated with the nonlinear dynamical system. When the limit of the
approximate conjugacies exists and attention is restricted to real Banach
spaces, a simple application of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem shows that both
the principle algebra and the pull-back algebra --- defined by composing the
principle algebra with the topological conjugacy --- are uniformly dense in
either the space of continuous functions or the maximal ideal of continuous
functions vanishing at the fixed point. The point is that, a priori, it is
difficult to know which space of observables to use for dissipative nonlinear
dynamical systems whose elements have spectral expansions into eigenfunctions.
These results say that any continuous observable is arbitrarily close to one

extending the field quantization to lossy and dispersive media in
nonequilibrium conditions has proven to be complicated due to the
position-dependent electric and magnetic responses of the media. In fact,
consistent position-dependent quantum models for the photon number in resonant
structures have only been formulated very recently and only for dielectric
media. Here we present a general position-dependent quantized fluctuational
electrodynamics (QFED) formalism that extends the consistent field quantization
to describe the photon number also in the presence of magnetic field-matter

degree of freedom in media where the magnetic coupling to the field is
prominent. Therefore, the field quantization requires an additional independent
noise operator that is commuting with the conventional bosonic noise operator
describing the polarization current fluctuations in dielectric media. In
addition to allowing the detailed description of field fluctuations, our
methods provide practical tools for modeling optical energy transfer and the
formation of thermal balance in general dielectric and magnetic nanodevices. We
use the QFED to investigate the magnetic properties of microcavity systems to
demonstrate an example geometry in which it is possible to probe fields arising
from the electric and magnetic source terms. We show that, as a consequence of

placed inside a vacuum cavity can make the emissivity of a magnetic emitter to
exceed the emissivity of a corresponding electric emitter.

the synchronization occurs for the whole current region that gives rise to the
excitation of self-oscillations. This is linked to the role of the
magnetodipolar coupling, which is the phenomenon driving the synchronization
when the distance between oscillators is not too large. Synchronization turns
out to be also robust against geometrical differences of the contacts,
simulated by considering variable distances between the tips ranging from 100nm
to 200nm. Besides, it entails an enlargement of the radiation pattern that can
be useful for the generation of spin-waves in magnonics applications.
Simulations performed to study the effect of the interfacial

the synchronized spin-wave. The simplicity of the geometry and the robustness

""point"" estimates (e.g., the computation of average flow field), but also
statistical estimates (e.g., quantification of uncertainty) that are beyond any

predicted to be significantly less than unity, making them uncompetitive as
thermoelectric materials. Here we elucidate a new strategy that overcomes this
limitation by creating multi-layer nanoribbons of two different materials and
allowing thermal and electrical currents to flow perpendicular to their planes.
To demonstrate this enhancement of thermoelectric efficiency ZT, we analyse the
thermoelectric performance of monolayer molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) sandwiched
between two graphene monolayers and demonstrate that the cross-plane (CP) ZT is
significantly enhanced compared with the pristine parent materials. For the
parent monolayer of MoS2, we find that ZT can be as high as approximately 0.3,
whereas monolayer graphene has a negligibly small ZT. In contrast for the
graphene/MoS2/graphene heterostructure, we find that the CP ZT can be as large
as 2.8. One contribution to this enhancement is a reduction of the thermal
conductance of the van der Waals heterostructure compared with the parent
materials, caused by a combination of boundary scattering at the MoS2/graphene
interface which suppresses the phonons transmission and the lower Debye
frequency of monolayer MoS2, which filters phonons from the monolayer graphene.
A second contribution is an increase in the electrical conductance and Seebeck
coefficient associated with molybdenum atoms at the edges of the nanoribbons.

models. They often transfer from one model to another, allowing attackers to
mount black box attacks without knowledge of the target model's parameters.
Adversarial training is the process of explicitly training a model on
adversarial examples, in order to make it more robust to attack or to reduce
its test error on clean inputs. So far, adversarial training has primarily been
applied to small problems. In this research, we apply adversarial training to
ImageNet. Our contributions include: (1) recommendations for how to succesfully
scale adversarial training to large models and datasets, (2) the observation
that adversarial training confers robustness to single-step attack methods, (3)
the finding that multi-step attack methods are somewhat less transferable than
single-step attack methods, so single-step attacks are the best for mounting
black-box attacks, and (4) resolution of a ""label leaking"" effect that causes
adversarially trained models to perform better on adversarial examples than on
clean examples, because the adversarial example construction process uses the
true label and the model can learn to exploit regularities in the construction
process.

models parameterized by neural networks, where the reparameterization trick is
widely used for those with continuous variables. While this technique gives
low-variance gradient estimates, it has not been directly applicable to
discrete variables, the sampling of which inherently requires discontinuous
operations. We argue that the discontinuity can be bypassed by marginalizing
out the variable of interest, which results in a new reparameterization trick
for discrete variables. This reparameterization greatly reduces the variance,
which is understood by regarding the method as an application of common random

distance from the Galactic center ($r$) and iron abundance ([M/H]), in the
range 5 $\lesssim r \lesssim$ 30 kpc and $-2.5 <$ [M/H] $<$ 0.0. We perform a
statistical analysis of the abundance ratios derived by the APOGEE pipeline
(ASPCAP) and distances calculated by several approaches. Our analysis reveals
signatures of a different chemical enrichment between the inner and outer
regions of the halo, with a transition at about 15 kpc. The derived metallicity
distribution function exhibits two peaks, at [M/H] $\sim -1.5$ and $\sim -2.1$,
consistent with previously reported halo metallicity distributions. We obtain a
difference of $\sim 0.1$ dex for $\alpha$-element-to-iron ratios for stars at
$r > 15$ kpc and [M/H] $> -1.1$ (larger in the case of O, Mg and S) with

low-$\alpha$ stars found at larger distances. Chemical differences in elements
with other nucleosynthetic origins (Ni, K, Na, and Al) are also detected. C and
N do not provide reliable information about the interstellar medium from which
stars formed because our sample comprises RGB and AGB stars and can experience

opens many avenues of research. Research particularly broadens the horizon of
chemical science. When atoms of a suitable element amalgamate under uniformly
attained dynamics, they execute confined interstate dynamics of outer ring
electrons. Atoms execute electron dynamics by entertaining forces mainly
related to the original zones of the growth. On attaining the neutral state for
an instant, the outer ring electron of an atom executes dynamics by involving
the conservative forces. On disappearing from the pole forces, that electron
regains the state in the next instant. In one cycle of interstate electron
dynamics, a binding energy shape like the path of dynamics generates. The
exerted forces remain almost in the associated formats of the growth of atoms.
In suitable gaseous elements, structures evolve in atoms above the ground
surface, semisolid atoms at the ground surface, and solid atoms below the
ground surface. A structural dimension depends on the number of electrons
executing dynamics simultaneously. In gaseous element atoms, binding is from
the upward sides. Binding atoms in solids are from the downward sides. A
nucleated mono-layer binds to another nucleated mono-layer by involving the
chemical force, where chemical energy engages. A surface plasmons phenomenon

provable guarantees for topic modeling. In standard topic models, a topic (such
as sports, business, or politics) is viewed as a probability distribution $\vec
a_i$ over words, and a document is generated by first selecting a mixture $\vec
w$ over topics, and then generating words i.i.d. from the associated mixture
$A{\vec w}$. Given a large collection of such documents, the goal is to recover
the topic vectors and then to correctly classify new documents according to
their topic mixture.
  In this work we consider a broad generalization of this framework in which
words are no longer assumed to be drawn i.i.d. and instead a topic is a complex
distribution over sequences of paragraphs. Since one could not hope to even
represent such a distribution in general (even if paragraphs are given using
some natural feature representation), we aim instead to directly learn a
document classifier. That is, we aim to learn a predictor that given a new
document, accurately predicts its topic mixture, without learning the
distributions explicitly. We present several natural conditions under which one
can do this efficiently and discuss issues such as noise tolerance and sample
complexity in this model. More generally, our model can be viewed as a
generalization of the multi-view or co-training setting in machine learning.

endowed with mass and gyroscopic inertia and connected by massless ligaments
with asymmetric elastic properties has been analysed through a discrete model
and a continuum micropolar model. In the first case the propagation of harmonic
waves and the dispersion functions have been obtained by the discrete
Floquet-Bloch approach. It is shown that the optical branch departs from a
critical point with vanishing group velocity and for the considered cases this
branch is decreasing for increasing the norm of the wave vector from the long
wave limit. A micropolar continuum model, useful to approximate the discrete
model, has been derived through a continualization method based on a
down-scaling law based on a second-order Taylor expansion of the generalized
macro-displacement field. It is worth noting that the second order elasticity
tensor coupling curvatures and micro-couples turns out to be negative defined
also in the general case of non-centrosymmetric lattice. The eigenvalue problem
governing the harmonic propagation in the micropolar non-centrosymmetric
continuum results in general characterized by a hermitian full matrix that is
exact up to the second order in the wave vector. Examples concerning square and
equilateral triangular lattices and their acoustic properties have been
analysed from both the exact Lagrangian model (within the assumed hypotheses)

definiteness of the second order elastic tensor of the micropolar model, the
loss of strong hyperbolicity of the equation of motion has been investigated.

branch are obtained in the frequency spectrum. A micropolar continuum model to
approximate the Lagrangian model has been derived based on a second-order
Taylor expansion of the generalized macro-displacement field. The constitutive
equations of the equivalent micropolar continuum have been obtained, with the
peculiarity that the positive definiteness of the second-order symmetric tensor
associated to the curvature vector is not guaranteed and depends both on the
ratio between the local tangent and normal stiffness and on the block shape.
The same results has been obtained through an extended Hamiltonian derivation
of the equations of motion for the equivalent continuum that is related to the
Hill-Mandel macro homogeneity condition. Moreover, it is shown that the
hermitian matrix governing the eigenproblem of harmonic wave propagation in the
micropolar model is exact up to the second order in the norm of the wave vector
with respect to the same matrix from the discrete model. To appreciate the
acoustic behavior of some relevant blocky materials and to understand the

blocky patterns have been analysed: rhombic and hexagonal assemblages and
running bond masonry.

accretion rates and the flow geometry change on a daily basis during each of
the outbursts could be understood very well using the recent implementation of
two component advective flow (TCAF) solution of the viscous transonic flow
equations as an additive table model in XSPEC. This has dramatically improved
our understanding about the accretion flow dynamics. Most interestingly, the
solution allows to treat mass of the black hole candidate as a free parameter
and there mass could be estimated from spectral fits. In this paper, we fit the
data of two successive outbursts of H~1743-322 in 2010 and 2011 and studied
evolutions of accretion flow parameters, such as, two component (Keplerian and
sub-Keplerian) accretion rates, shock location (i.e., size of the Compton
cloud), etc. We assume that the model Normalization remains the same accross
the states in both these outbursts. We use this to estimate mass of the black
hole and found that it comes out in the range of $9.25-12.86 M_\odot$. For the
sake of comparison, we also estimated mass using Photon index vs. QPO frequency
correlation method which turns out to be $11.65 \pm 0.67 M_\odot$ using GRO
J1655-40 as reference source. Combining these two estimates, the most probable
mass of the compact object becomes $11.21^{+1.65}_{-1.96} M_\odot$.

hierarchical feature abstraction enables recent success of deep learning. Under
the deep learning framework, generalization performance highly depends on the
learned latent representation which is obtained from an appropriate training
scenario with a task-specific objective on a designed network model. In this
work, we propose a novel latent space modeling method to learn better latent
representation. We designed a neural network model based on the assumption that
good base representation can be attained by maximizing the total correlation
between the input, latent, and output variables. From the base model, we
introduce a semantic noise modeling method which enables class-conditional
perturbation on latent space to enhance the representational power of learned
latent feature. During training, latent vector representation can be
stochastically perturbed by a modeled class-conditional additive noise while
maintaining its original semantic feature. It implicitly brings the effect of
semantic augmentation on the latent space. The proposed model can be easily
learned by back-propagation with common gradient-based optimization algorithms.
Experimental results show that the proposed method helps to achieve performance
benefits against various previous approaches. We also provide the empirical
analyses for the proposed class-conditional perturbation process including
t-SNE visualization.

(CO) within a distribution of plasma with power-law density $\propto r^{-h}$.
For the simplest case of a cloud of spherically symmetric cold non-magnetized
plasma, the diverging effect of the plasma and the converging effect of
gravitational lensing compete with one another. When $h<2$, the plasma effect
dominates over the vacuum Schwarzschild curvature, potentially shifting the
radius of the unstable circular photon orbit outside the surface of the CO.
When this occurs, we define two relatively narrow radio-frequency bands in
which plasma effects are particularly significant. Rays in the escape window
have $\omega_{0} < \omega \leq \omega_{+}$ and are free to propagate to
infinity from the CO surface. To a distant observer, the visible portion of the
CO surface appears to shrink as the observed frequency is reduced, and vanishes
entirely at $\omega_{0}$, in excess of the plasma frequency at the CO surface.
We define the anomalous propagation window for frequencies $\omega_{-}< \omega
\leq \omega_{0}$. Rays emitted from the CO surface within this frequency range
are dominated by optical effects from the plasma and curve back to the surface
of the CO, effectively cloaking the star from distant observers. We conclude
with a study of neutron star (NS) compactness ratios for a variety of nuclear
matter equations of state (EoS). For $h=1$, NSs generated from stiff EoS should
display significant frequency dependence in the EW, and lower values of $h$
with softer EoS can also show these effects.

velocity continuity along the triplet axis. The faintest component of the
triplet is extremely gas-rich (MHI/LB ~ 17) and also extremely metal deficient
(12+log(O/H) ~ 7.0). The metallicity of this dwarf is close to the 'floor'
observed in star forming galaxies. Low resolution HI images show that the
galaxy triplet is located inside a common HI envelope, with fairly regular,
disk like kinematics. At high angular resolution however, the gas is found to
be confined to several filamentary tidal tails and bridges. The linear
alignment of the galaxies, along with the velocity continuity that we observe,
is consistent with the galaxies lying along a filament. We argue that the
location of this highly unusual system in an extremely low density environment
is not a coincidence, but is a consequence of structure formation proceeding
more slowly and also probing smaller scales than in regions with average
density. Our observations also indicate that wet mergers of galaxies flowing
along filaments is a possible pathway for the formation of gas rich disks. The
UGC 3672 system provides an interesting opportunity to study the kind of
interactions typical between high redshift extremely gas rich unevolved small

Universe. These events have significant impact on the intra-cluster medium,
depositing vast amounts of energy - often in the form of shocks - as well as
heavily influencing the properties of the constituent galaxy population. Many
clusters have been shown to host large-scale diffuse radio emission, known
variously as radio haloes and relics. These sources arise as a result of
electron (re-)acceleration in cluster-scale magnetic fields, although the
processes by which this occurs are still poorly understood. We present new,
deep radio observations of the high-redshift galaxy cluster MACS
J0025.4$-$1222, taken with the GMRT at 325 MHz, as well as new analysis of all
archival $Chandra$ X-ray observations. We aim to investigate the potential of
diffuse radio emission and categorise the radio population of this cluster,
which has only been covered previously by shallow radio surveys. We produce
low-resolution maps of MACS J0025.4$-$1222 through a combination of uv-tapering
and subtracting the compact source population. Radial surface brightness and
mass profiles are derived from the $Chandra$ data. We also derive a 2D map of
the ICM temperature. For the first time, two sources of diffuse radio emission
are detected in MACS J0025.4$-$1222, on linear scales of several hundred kpc.
Given the redshift of the cluster and the assumed cosmology, these sources
appear to be consistent with established trends in power scaling relations for
radio relics. The X-ray temperature map presents evidence of an asymmetric
temperature profile and tentative identification of a temperature jump
associated with one relic. We classify the pair of diffuse radio sources in
this cluster as a pair of radio relics, given their consistency with scaling
relations, location toward the cluster outskirts, and the available X-ray data.

and Random Forest) is a widely used machine learning algorithm, due to its
practical effectiveness and model interpretability. With the emergence of big
data, there is an increasing need to parallelize the training process of
decision tree. However, most existing attempts along this line suffer from high
communication costs. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called
\emph{Parallel Voting Decision Tree (PV-Tree)}, to tackle this challenge. After
partitioning the training data onto a number of (e.g., $M$) machines, this
algorithm performs both local voting and global voting in each iteration. For
local voting, the top-$k$ attributes are selected from each machine according
to its local data. Then, globally top-$2k$ attributes are determined by a
majority voting among these local candidates. Finally, the full-grained
histograms of the globally top-$2k$ attributes are collected from local
machines in order to identify the best (most informative) attribute and its
split point. PV-Tree can achieve a very low communication cost (independent of
the total number of attributes) and thus can scale out very well. Furthermore,
theoretical analysis shows that this algorithm can learn a near optimal
decision tree, since it can find the best attribute with a large probability.
Our experiments on real-world datasets show that PV-Tree significantly
outperforms the existing parallel decision tree algorithms in the trade-off
between accuracy and efficiency.

Degrees of Freedom (puDoF) as the number of transmitter-receiver pairs goes to

cooperation schemes do not increases the puDoF value, and that the optimal
scheme relies on assigning each message to a single transmitter and using
orthogonal access (TDMA). Here, we extend this conclusion to the case where
L=2, by proving optimality of TDMA in this case as well. We conclude by
discussing whether increasing the value of L can create a value for linear
cooperation schemes from a DoF perspective.

the Greenland ice sheet (Greenland Summit Camp) at an altitude of 3200 m using
a tipping radiometer. We chose this site as our submillimeter telescope
(Greenland Telescope; GLT) site, because its location offers favorable
baselines to existing submillimeter telescopes for global-scale VLBI. The site
shows a clear seasonal variation with the average opacity lower by a factor of
two during winter. For the winter quartiles of 25% and 50%, the Greenland site
is about 10%-30% worse than the ALMA or the South Pole sites. Estimated
atmospheric transmission spectra in winter season are similar to the ALMA site
at lower frequencies (<450 GHz), which are transparent enough to perform
astronomical observations almost all of the winter time with opacities <0.5,
but 10%-25% higher opacities at higher frequencies (>450 GHz) than those at the
ALMA site. This is due to the lower altitude of the Greenland site.
Nevertheless, half of the winter time at the Greenland site can be used for
astronomical observations at frequencies between 450 GHz and 1000 GHz with
opacities <1.2, and 10% of the time show >10% transmittance in the THz (1035
GHz, 1350 GHz, and 1500 GHz) windows. One major advantage of the Greenland site
in winter is that there is no diurnal variation due to the polar night
condition, and therefore the durations of low-opacity conditions are
significantly longer than at the ALMA site. Opacities lower than 0.05 or 0.04
can continue for more than 100 hours. Such long stable opacity conditions do
not occur as often even at the South Pole; it happens only for the opacity
lower than 0.05. Since the opacity variation is directly related to the sky
temperature (background) variation, the Greenland site is suitable for
astronomical observations that need unusually stable sky background.

interferometer, the phase of the signal photon in the visible range depends on
the phase of an entangled IR photon. When the IR photon is traveling through
the media, its properties can be found from observations of the visible photon.
We directly acquire the SPDC signal with a visible range CCD camera and use a
numerical algorithm to infer the absorption coefficient and the refraction

this pulsar's gamma-ray pulsations, we measure its braking index over five
years of LAT observations to be $n = 2.598 \pm 0.001 \pm 0.1$, where the first
uncertainty is statistical and the second estimates the bias due to timing
noise. Assuming its braking index has been similar since birth, the pulsar has
an estimated age of around 2,700 yr, making it the youngest pulsar to be found
in a blind search of gamma-ray data and the youngest known radio-quiet
gamma-ray pulsar. Despite its young age the pulsar is not associated with any
known supernova remnant or pulsar wind nebula. The pulsar's inferred dipolar
surface magnetic field strength is $3.8 \times 10^{13}$ G, almost 90% of the
quantum-critical level. We investigate some potential physical causes of the
braking index deviating from the simple dipole model but find that LAT data
covering a longer time interval will be necessary to distinguish between these.

advanced structural characterization tools. Our proof-of-concept is performed
by conceptually straightforward exact-disorder tight-binding calculations. The
underlying stochastical tight-binding scheme only parametrizes bulk band
structure properties and does not employ additional free parameters to
calculate the optical absorption spectrum, which is an easily accessible
experimental property. The method is applied to selected realizations of type-I
Cd(Se,S) and type-II (Zn,Cd)(Se,S) alloyed quantum dots with an underlying
zincblende crystal structure and the corresponding core/shell counterparts.

different access points (base stations) that provide wireless access to
services and applications. In general, the service demand is very
heterogeneous, non-uniformly distributed, and dynamic. Consequently, radio
access networks create very irregular topologies with more access points where
service demand is concentrated. While this dynamism requires networks with the
ability to adapt to time-varying conditions, the non-uniformity of the service
demand makes the planning, analysis, and optimization difficult. In order to
help with these tasks, a framework based on canonical domains and spatial
mappings (e.g., conformal mapping) have recently been proposed. The idea is to
carry out part of the planning in a canonical (perfectly symmetric) domain that
is connected to the physical one (real-scenario) by means of a spatial
transformation designed to map the access points consistently with the service
demand. This paper continues the research in that direction by introducing
additional tools and possibilities to that framework, namely the use of
centroidal Voronoi algorithms and non-conformal composite mappings. Moreover,
power optimization is also introduced to the framework. The results show the
usability and effectiveness of the proposed method and its promising research
perspectives.

trigger the rp-process in type I x-ray bursts. In this environment, a
competition between $^{15}\text{O}(\alpha,\gamma){^{19}\text{Ne}}$ and the
two-proton capture reaction $^{15}\text{O}(2p,\gamma){^{17}\text{Ne}}$ is
expected.
  Purpose: Determine the three-body radiative capture reaction rate for
${^{17}\text{Ne}}$ formation including sequential and direct, resonant and
non-resonant contributions on an equal footing.
  Method: Two different discretization methods have been applied to generate
$^{17}$Ne states in a full three-body model: the analytical transformed
harmonic oscillator method and the hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method.
The binary $p$--$^{15}$O interaction has been adjusted to reproduce the known
spectrum of the unbound $^{16}$F nucleus. The dominant $E1$ contributions to
the $^{15}\text{O}(2p,\gamma){^{17}\text{Ne}}$ reaction rate have been
calculated from the inverse photodissociation process.
  Results: Three-body calculations provide a reliable description of $^{17}$Ne
states. The agreement with the available experimental data on $^{17}$Ne is
discussed. It is shown that the $^{15}\text{O}(2p,\gamma){^{17}\text{Ne}}$
reaction rates computed within the two methods agree in a broad range of
temperatures. The present calculations are compared with a previous theoretical
estimation of the reaction rate.
  Conclusions: It is found that the full three-body model provides a reaction
rate several orders of magnitude larger than the only previous estimation. The
implications for the rp-process in type I x-ray bursts should be investigated.

operators for SRs based on the group representation theory. We also introduce
another type of projection operators for chemical elements, which enables us to
decompose the unfolded band structures into the contributions of different
combinations of chemical elements. Using the current method, we investigate the
phonon band structure of disordered face-centered cubic Cu0.75Au0.25, which has
large variations of atomic masses and force constants among the atomic sites

discontinuous and split branches in the unfolded phonon band structure. They
are found to occur because different combinations of the chemical elements

With eleven eruptions now identified, including eight in the past eight years,
the system exhibits a recurrence period of one year, and possibly just six
months. This short inter eruption period is driven by the combination of a high
mass white dwarf ($1.38\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) and high mass accretion rate
($\sim1.6\times10^{-7}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$). Such a high
accretion rate appears to be provided by the stellar wind of a red giant
companion. Deep H$\alpha$ observations have revealed the presence of a vastly
extended nebula around the system, which could be the `super-remnant' of many
thousands of past eruptions. With a prediction of the white dwarf reaching the
Chandrasekhar mass in less than a mega-year, M31N 2008-12a has become the

data exploration, access and visualisation. The Hierarchical Progressive Survey
(HiPS) is a HEALPix based scheme that enables a multi-resolution approach to
astronomy data from the individual pixels up to the whole sky. We highlight the
decisions and approaches that have been taken to make this scheme a practical
solution for managing large volumes of heterogeneous data. Early implementors
of this system have formed a network of HiPS nodes, with some 250 diverse data
sets currently available, with multiple mirror implementations for important
data sets. This hierarchical approach can be adapted to expose Big Data in
different ways. We describe how the ease of implementation, and local
customisation of the Aladin Lite embeddable HiPS visualiser have been keys for
promoting collaboration on HiPS.

detectable with the LSST SN deep fields (15,000 SNe on 70 deg^2) at ~6sigma
level of confidence (assuming 0.15 magnitudes of intrinsic dispersion). The
SN-galaxy cross-correlation function will deliver much higher signal-to-noise,
being detectable in both surveys with an integrated signal-to-noise of ~100 (up
to 30 arcmin separations). We predict joint constraints on the matter density
parameter (Omega_m) and the clustering amplitude (sigma_8) by fitting the
auto-correlation function of our mock LSST deep fields. When assuming a
Gaussian prior for Omega_m, we can achieve a 25% measurement of sigma_8 from
just these LSST supernovae (assuming 0.15 magnitudes of intrinsic dispersion).
These constraints will improve significantly if the intrinsic dispersion of SNe
Ia can be reduced.

Two resonant structures are observed in a fit to the cross section. The first

$(44.1\pm 4.3\pm 2.0)$~MeV, while the second one has a mass of $(4320.0\pm 10.4

the first errors are statistical and second ones are systematic. The first

The precision of its resonant parameters is improved significantly. The second
resonance is observed in $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-J/\psi$ for the first time. The

programs is to provide efficient yet precise analysis of output errors.
  We present a framework to compute lower bounds on largest absolute roundoff
errors, for a particular rounding model. This method applies to numerical
programs implementing polynomial functions with box constrained input
variables. Our study is based on three different hierarchies, relying
respectively on generalized eigenvalue problems, elementary computations and
semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. This is complementary of
over-approximation frameworks, consisting of obtaining upper bounds on the
largest absolute roundoff error. Combining the results of both frameworks
allows to get enclosures for upper bounds on roundoff errors.
  The under-approximation framework provided by the third hierarchy is based on
a new sequence of convergent robust SDP approximations for certain classes of
polynomial optimization problems. Each problem in this hierarchy can be solved
exactly via SDP. By using this hierarchy, one can provide a monotone
non-decreasing sequence of lower bounds converging to the absolute roundoff
error of a program implementing a polynomial function, applying for a
particular rounding model.
  We investigate the efficiency and precision of our method on non-trivial
polynomial programs coming from space control, optimization and computational
biology.

squeeze the relative motion of a pair of atoms and generate non-classical
mechanical states. Extending this pairwise scheme to one-dimensional chains
provides flexible control over the mechanical degrees of freedom of the whole

transforms the hidden order into magnetically-ordered phases, whose order

this note, we study some genealogical properties of this population when the
sample is conditioned to fall entirely into a subpopulation with most recent
common ancestor (MRCA) shorter than $\varepsilon$. First, using the comb
representation of the total genealogy (Lambert & Uribe Bravo 2016), we show
that the genealogy of the descendance of the MRCA of the sample on the
timescale $\varepsilon$ converges as $\varepsilon\to 0$. The limit is the
so-called Brownian coalescent point process (CPP) stopped at an independent
Gamma random variable with parameter $n$, which can be seen as the genealogy at
a large time of the total population of a rescaled critical birth-death
process, biased by the $n$-th power of its size. Secondly, we show that in this
limit the coalescence times of the $n$ sampled individuals are i.i.d. uniform
random variables in $(0,1)$. These results provide a coupling between two
standard models for the genealogy of a random exchangeable population: the

key technologies for visualizing the dynamics of single molecules or organelles

imaging mouse embryonic fibroblasts. By targeting various dyes and

then use the temporal Graph Signal Transform technique to decompose the time

of structural modes by the non-linear dynamics, and thus coherent patterns of
activity of the spins. These signatures of the macroscopic states are
independent of the underlying networks and can thus be used as universal
signatures for the macroscopic states. This work opens new avenues to analyse

the problem is decidable for vector-space targets of dimension at most three,
followed by another development showing that the problem is in PSPACE for

based on the dd->3He n reaction and quasi-free proton-proton scattering via
dd->pp n_spectator n_spectator reactions. The excitation functions determined
independently for the measured reactions do not reveal a structure which could
be interpreted as a narrow mesic nucleus. Therefore, the upper limits of the
total cross sections for the bound state production and decay in
dd->(4He-eta)_bound->3He n pi0 and dd->(4He-eta)_bound->3He p pi- processes
were determined taking into account the isospin relation between both the

the N* momentum distribution in the anticipated mesic-4He. Assuming as in the
previous works, that this is identical with the distribution of nucleons bound
with 20 MeV in 4He, we determined that (for the mesic bound state width in the
range from 5 MeV to 50 MeV) the upper limits at 90% confidence level are about
3 nb and about 6 nb for npi0 and ppi- channels, respectively. However, based on
the recent theoretical findings of the N*(1535) momentum distribution in the

confirm in the continuous setting the validity of related asymmetric maximal

As for other results in noncommutative martingale theory, the passage from
discrete to continuous index is quite technical and requires genuinely new
methods. Our approach towards asymmetric maximal inequalities is based on
certain construction of conditional expectations for a sequence of projective
systems of $L_p$-modules. The convergence in $\mathcal H_p^r(\mathcal M)$ and
$\mathcal H_p^c(\mathcal M)$ also imposes new algebraic atomic decompositions.

non-unified equations of state with a simplified matching between the crust and

which can be larger than the expected precision of the next generation of X-ray
satellites.
  We aim at eliminating the dependence of the radius and mass of neutron staron
the detailed model for the crust and on the crust-core matching procedure. We
solve the approximate equations of the hydrostatic equilibrium for the crust of
neutron stars obtaining a precise formula for the radius which depends only on
the core mass and radius, and on the baryon chemical potential at the
core-crust interface and on the crust surface. For a fully accreted crust one
needs additionally the value of the total deep crustal heating per one accreted
nucleon.
  For typical neutron star masses the approximate approach allows to determine
the neutron star radius with an error ~0.1% (~ 10 m, equivalent to a 1%
inaccuracy in the crust thickness).
  The formalism applies to neutron stars with a catalyzed or a fully accreted
crust. The difference in the neutron star radius between the two models is
proportional to the total energy release due to deep crustal heating.
  For a given model of dense matter describing the neutron star core, the
radius of a neutron star can be accurately determined independently of the
crust model with a precision much better than the ~5% one expected from the
next generation of X-ray satellites. This allows to circumvent the problem of
the radius uncertainty which may arise when non-unified equations of state for

out-of-band (OOB) radiation to avoid excessive interference. For legacy
systems, OOB radiation is well understood and is commonly handled by digital
precompensation techniques. When using large arrays, however, new phenomena and
hardware limitations have to be considered. First, signals can be radiated
directionally, which might focus the OOB radiation. Second, low-complexity
hardware is used for cost reasons, which increases the relative amount of OOB
radiation. Given that massive MIMO and millimeter wave communication rely on
base stations with a large number of antennas, the spatial behavior of OOB
radiation from large arrays will have significant implications for the hardware
requirements of future base stations. We show that, if the OOB radiation is
beamformed, its array gain is never larger than that of the in-band signal. In
many cases, the OOB radiation is close to isotropic even when the in-band
signal is highly directive. With the same total radiated power, the OOB
radiation from large arrays is therefore never more severe than from a legacy
system with the same adjacent-channel-leakage ratio. Further, the OOB radiation
is less detrimental than from a legacy system since the high array gain of the
in-band signal allows large arrays to radiate less total power than legacy
systems. We also show how OOB radiation from large arrays varies with location
in static propagation environments and how these effects vanish when averaged
over the small-scale fading. Since a higher relative amount of OOB radiation
can be tolerated for large arrays, the linearity requirement can be relaxed as
compared to legacy systems. Specifically, less stringent linearity requirements
on each transmitter makes it possible to build large arrays from low-complexity
hardware.

the problem of diagnostic checking fitted models has not been addressed. In
this paper, we develop portmanteau tests for checking randomness of a time
series with infinite variance and as a diagnostic tool for checking model
adequacy of fitted ARMA models. It is assumed that least-squares or an
asymptotically equivalent estimation method, such as Gaussian maximum
likelihood in the case of AR models, is used. And it is assumed that the
distribution of the innovations is IID stable Paretian. It is seen via
simulation that the proposed portmanteau tests do not converge well to the
corresponding limiting distributions for practical series length so a
Monte-Carlo test is suggested. Simulation experiments show that the proposed
test procedure works effectively. Two illustrative applications to actual data
are provided to demonstrate that an incorrect conclusion may result if the
usual portmanteau test based on the finite variance assumption is used.

volume fractions in a sucrose solution in which they are partially soluble; a
model system for a wide class of crystal mushes or slurries. Under step changes
in shear rate, the viscosity changes to a new `relaxed' value over several
minutes, in a manner well fitted by a single exponential. The behavior of the
relaxed viscosity is power-law shear thinning with shear rate, with an exponent
of $-1.76 \pm 0.25$, so that shear stress falls with increasing shear rate. On
longer timescales, the crystals ripen (leading to a falling viscosity) so that
the mean radius increases with time to the power $0.14 \pm 0.07$. We speculate
that this unusually small exponent is due to the interaction of classical
ripening dynamics with abrasion or breakup under flow. We compare the
rheological behavior to mechanistic models based on flow-induced aggregation
and breakup of crystal clusters, finding that the exponents can be predicted
from liquid phase sintering and breakup by brittle fracture.

processing is typically attributed to their ability to capture long-distance
statistical regularities. Linguistic regularities are often sensitive to
syntactic structure; can such dependencies be captured by LSTMs, which do not
have explicit structural representations? We begin addressing this question
using number agreement in English subject-verb dependencies. We probe the
architecture's grammatical competence both using training objectives with an
explicit grammatical target (number prediction, grammaticality judgments) and
using language models. In the strongly supervised settings, the LSTM achieved
very high overall accuracy (less than 1% errors), but errors increased when
sequential and structural information conflicted. The frequency of such errors
rose sharply in the language-modeling setting. We conclude that LSTMs can
capture a non-trivial amount of grammatical structure given targeted
supervision, but stronger architectures may be required to further reduce
errors; furthermore, the language modeling signal is insufficient for capturing
syntax-sensitive dependencies, and should be supplemented with more direct
supervision if such dependencies need to be captured.

provide sufficient conditions for strong consistency under general dependence

associated error measures that coherently accounts for the dependence structure
present in the model. We advocate posterior versions of FDR and FNR as
appropriate error rates and show that their asymptotic convergence rates are
directly associated with the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the true model.
Our results hold even when the class of postulated models is misspecified. We
illustrate our results in a variable selection problem with autoregressive
response variables, and compare the new Bayesian procedure with some existing
methods through extensive simulation studies in the variable selection problem.
Superior performance of the new procedure compared to the others vindicate that
proper exploitation of the dependence structure by multiple testing methods is
indeed important. Moreover, we obtain encouraging results in a real, maize data

X-ray observations, optical spectroscopy, near-IR interferometry, and mid-IR
photometry of this system to constrain its parameters and further explore the
cause of the dust mass loss. In X-rays TYC 8241 2652 1 has all properties
expected from a young star: Its luminosity is in the saturation regime and the
abundance pattern shows enhancement of O/Fe. The photospheric Ha line is filled
with a weak emission feature, indicating chromospheric activity consistent with
the observed level of coronal emission. Interferometry does not detect a
companion and sets upper limits on the companion mass of 0.2, 0.35, 0.1 and
0.05 M_sun at projected physical separations of 0.1-4 AU,4-5 AU, 5-10 AU, and
10-30 AU, respectively (assuming a distance of 120.9 pc). Our mid-IR
measurements, the first of the system since 2012, are consistent with the

in quantum field theory. Besides its physical applications, HDQCD is relatively
easy to implement numerically: the fermionic degrees of freedom are integrated
out, and the fermion determinant factorises into local ones. The theory has a
sign problem, the severeness of which depends on the value of the chemical
potential, which makes this theory ideal to test the reach of new algorithms.
We use the LLR approach to obtain the probability distribution of the phase of
the fermion determinant. Our goal is the calculation of the phase factor
expectation value, which appears as Fourier transform of this probability
distribution. We here propose a new and systematic moment expansion for this
phase factor. We compare the answer from the moment expansion order by order
with the exact answer. We find that this expansion converge quickly and works
very well in the strong sign problem region.

differential equation under model uncertainty. The model uncertainty is
represented by ambiguity about the law $\mathcal{L}(X(t))$ of the state $X(t)$
at time $t$. For example, it could be the law $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbb{P}}(X(t))$
of $X(t)$ with respect to the given, underlying probability measure
$\mathbb{P}$. This is the classical case when there is no model uncertainty.
But it could also be the law $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbb{Q}}(X(t))$ with respect to
some other probability measure $\mathbb{Q}$ or, more generally, any random
measure $\mu(t)$ on $\mathbb{R}$ with total mass $1$.
  We represent this model uncertainty control problem as a stochastic
differential game of a mean-field related type stochastic differential equation
(SDE) with two players. The control of one of the players, representing the
uncertainty of the law of the state, is a measure valued stochastic process
$\mu(t)$ and the control of the other player is a classical real-valued
stochastic process $u(t)$. This control with respect to random probability
processes $\mu(t)$ on $\mathbb{R}$ is a new type of stochastic control problems
that has not been studied before. By introducing operator-valued backward
stochastic differential equations, we obtain a sufficient maximum principle for
Nash equilibria for such games in the general nonzero-sum case, and saddle
points for zero-sum games.
  As an application we find an explicit solution of the problem of optimal
consumption under model uncertainty of a cash flow described by a mean-field
related type SDE.

data -i.e., a set of nodes endowed with pairwise dissimilarities- is presented.
The introduced method is hierarchical in the sense that it outputs a nested
collection of groupings of the node set depending on the resolution or degree
of similarity desired, and it is overlapping since it allows nodes to belong to
more than one group. Our construction is rooted on the facts that a
hierarchical (non-overlapping) clustering of a network can be equivalently
represented by a finite ultrametric space and that a convex combination of
ultrametrics results in a cut metric. By applying a hierarchical
(non-overlapping) clustering method to multiple dithered versions of a given
network and then convexly combining the resulting ultrametrics, we obtain a cut
metric associated to the network of interest. We then show how to extract a
hierarchical overlapping clustering structure from the aforementioned cut
metric. Furthermore, the so-called overlapping function is presented as a tool
for gaining insights about the data by identifying meaningful resolutions of
the obtained hierarchical structure. Additionally, we explore hierarchical
overlapping quasi-clustering methods that preserve the asymmetry of the data
contained in directed networks. Finally, the presented method is illustrated
via synthetic and real-world classification problems including handwritten

optimization for a series of simulated treatments on a one-dimensional patient
phantom. The plan applied during the first fractions should be able to handle
anticipated systematic and random errors. At scheduled fractions, the impact of
the measured errors on the delivered dose distribution is evaluated. For a
patient receiving a dose that does not satisfy clinical goals, the plan is
reoptimized based on these individually measured errors. The adapted plan is
then applied during subsequent fractions until a new scheduled adaptation
becomes necessary. In the first adaptive strategy, the measured systematic and
random error scenarios and their assigned probabilities are updated to guide
the robust reoptimization. In the second strategy, the grade of
conservativeness is adapted in response to the measured dose delivery errors.
In the third strategy, the uncertainty margins around the target are
recalculated based on the measured errors. The simulated systematic and random
errors are either similar to the anticipated errors or unpredictably larger, in
order to critically evaluate the performance of the adaptive strategies. The
simulations show that robustly optimized treatment plans provide sufficient
treatment quality for those treatment error scenarios similar to the
anticipated error scenarios. Combining robust planning with adaptation leads to
improved OAR protection. In case of unpredictably larger treatment errors, the
first strategy performs best at improving treatment quality in terms of target
coverage and OAR protection. According to the simulations, these robust
adaptive treatment strategies are able to identify candidates for an adaptive
treatment, thus giving the opportunity to provide individualized plans, and
improve their treatment quality through adaptation.

ground-based follow-up spectroscopy showed that this system is a double-lined
spectroscopic binary, with a mass ratio close to unity. However, the
fundamental parameters of the components of this system as well as their
lithium abundances differ substantially. Kepler photometry of this system

Indications of the seismic signature of the secondary are found. The differing

adversarially placed treasure, while relying on local, partial information.
Specifically, each node in the tree holds a pointer to one of its neighbors,
termed \emph{advice}. A node is faulty with probability $q$. The advice at a
non-faulty node points to the neighbor that is closer to the treasure, and the
advice at a faulty node points to a uniformly random neighbor. Crucially, the
advice is {\em permanent}, in the sense that querying the same node again would
yield the same answer. Let $\Delta$ denote the maximal degree. Roughly
speaking, when considering the expected number of {\em moves}, i.e., edge
traversals, we show that a phase transition occurs when the {\em noise
parameter} $q$ is about $1/\sqrt{\Delta}$. Below the threshold, there exists an
algorithm with expected move complexity $O(D\sqrt{\Delta})$, where $D$ is the
depth of the treasure, whereas above the threshold, every search algorithm has
expected number of moves which is both exponential in $D$ and polynomial in the
number of nodes~$n$. In contrast, if we require to find the treasure with
probability at least $1-\delta$, then for every fixed $\varepsilon > 0$, if
$q<1/\Delta^{\varepsilon}$ then there exists a search strategy that with
probability $1-\delta$ finds the treasure using $(\delta^{-1}D)^{O(\frac 1

\varepsilon)}$ moves are necessary. Besides the number of moves, we also study
the number of advice {\em queries} required to find the treasure. Roughly
speaking, for this complexity, we show similar threshold results to those

density profiles. The first method deals directly with fitting the rotation
curve data in the range of galactocentric distances $0.24\,\text{kpc}\leq
r\leq22.72\,\text{kpc}.$ As found in a previous paper by
\citet{Corbelli:2014lga}, and using the results of collisionless $\Lambda-$Cold
Dark Matter numerical simulations, we confirm that the Navarro-Frenkel-White
(hereafter NFW) dark matter profile provides a better fit to the rotation curve
data than the cored Burkert profile (hereafter BRK) profile. The second method
relies on the local equation of centrifugal equilibrium and on the rotation
curve slope. In the aforementioned range of distances we fit the observed
velocity profile, using a function which has a rational dependence on the
radius, and derive the slope of the rotation curve. Following
\citet{Salucci:2010qr} we then infer the effective matter densities. In the
radial range $9.53\,\text{kpc}\leq r\leq22.72\,\text{kpc}$ the uncertainties
induced by the luminous matter (stars and gas) becomes negligible, because the
dark matter density dominates, and we can determine locally the radial
distribution of dark matter. With this second method we tested the NFW and the
BRK dark matter profiles and confirm that both profiles are compatible with the
data even though in this case the cored BRK density profile provides a more
reasonable value for the baryonic-to-dark matter ratio.

decomposed into a set of subsystems sharing the same size with one single

shown that communication topology, especially the leader's information, exerts
great influence on both robustness performance and controller synthesis.
Further, an intuitive optimization problem is formulated to optimize an

high-pressure physics and astrophysics. Especially, the melting of dense
hydrogen is complicated by dimer dissociation, metallization and nuclear
quantum effect of protons, which together lead to a cold melting of dense
hydrogen when above 500 GPa. Nonetheless, the variation of the melting curve at
higher pressures is virtually uncharted. Here we report that using ab initio
molecular dynamics and path integral simulations based on density functional
theory, a new atomic phase is discovered, which gives an uplifting melting
curve of dense hydrogen when beyond 2 TPa, and results in a reentrant
solid-liquid transition before entering the Wigner crystalline phase of
protons. The findings greatly extend the phase diagram of dense hydrogen, and
put metallic hydrogen into the group of alkali metals, with its melting curve
closely resembling those of lithium and sodium. [With erratum. And the

  Boundary",,,,,"cs.CG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The convex hull of a set of points, $C$, serves to expose extremal properties
of $C$ and can help identify elements in $C$ of high interest. For many
problems, particularly in the presence of noise, the true vertex set (and
facets) may be difficult to determine. One solution is to expand the list of
high interest candidates to points lying near the boundary of the convex hull.
We propose a quadratic program for the purpose of stratifying points in a data
cloud based on proximity to the boundary of the convex hull. For each data
point, a quadratic program is solved to determine an associated weight vector.
We show that the weight vector encodes geometric information concerning the
point's relationship to the boundary of the convex hull. The computation of the
weight vectors can be carried out in parallel, and for a fixed number of points
and fixed neighborhood size, the overall computational complexity of the
algorithm grows linearly with dimension. As a consequence, meaningful
computations can be completed on reasonably large, high dimensional data sets.

special case of what are known as Beltrami fields, or linear force-free fields.
The scheme of this work relies on the generalized Debye source representation
of Maxwell fields and an integral representation of Beltrami fields which
immediately yields a well-conditioned second-kind integral equation. This
integral equation has a unique solution whenever the Beltrami parameter
$\lambda$ is not a member of a discrete, countable set of resonances which
physically correspond to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Several numerical
examples relevant to magnetohydrodynamic equilibria calculations are provided.
Lastly, our approach easily generalizes to arbitrary geometries, both bounded

be used in spiking neural networks (SNN) to extract visual features of low or
intermediate complexity in an unsupervised manner. These studies, however, used
relatively shallow architectures, and only one layer was trainable. Another
line of research has demonstrated - using rate-based neural networks trained
with back-propagation - that having many layers increases the recognition
robustness, an approach known as deep learning. We thus designed a deep SNN,
comprising several convolutional (trainable with STDP) and pooling layers. We
used a temporal coding scheme where the most strongly activated neurons fire
first, and less activated neurons fire later or not at all. The network was
exposed to natural images. Thanks to STDP, neurons progressively learned
features corresponding to prototypical patterns that were both salient and
frequent. Only a few tens of examples per category were required and no label
was needed. After learning, the complexity of the extracted features increased
along the hierarchy, from edge detectors in the first layer to object
prototypes in the last layer. Coding was very sparse, with only a few thousands
spikes per image, and in some cases the object category could be reasonably
well inferred from the activity of a single higher-order neuron. More
generally, the activity of a few hundreds of such neurons contained robust
category information, as demonstrated using a classifier on Caltech 101,
ETH-80, and MNIST databases. We also demonstrate the superiority of STDP over
other unsupervised techniques such as random crops (HMAX) or auto-encoders.
Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of STDP with latency
coding may be a key to understanding the way that the primate visual system
learns, its remarkable processing speed and its low energy consumption.

structures is unique and intriguing among transition metals. In this work, the
stability of these phases is revisited by using density functional theory. At
finite temperatures, a novel transition of rhombohedral phases back to BCC
phase induced by thermal electrons is discovered. This reentrant transition is
found not driven by phonons, instead it is the electronic entropy that
stabilizes the latter phase, which is totally out of expectation. Parallel to
this transition, we find a peculiar and strong increase of the shear modulus
C44 with increasing temperature. It is counter-intuitive in the sense that it
suggests an unusual harding mechanism of vanadium by temperature. With these
stability analyses, the high-pressure and finite-temperature phase diagram of
vanadium is proposed. Furthermore, the dependence of the stability of RH phases
on the Fermi energy and chemical environment is investigated. The results
demonstrate that the position of the Fermi level has a significant impact on
the phase stability, and follows the band-filling argument. Besides the Fermi
surface nesting, we find that the localization/delocalization of the d orbitals
also contributes to the instability of rhombohedral distortions in vanadium.

from large silicon area and high power consumption due to the their high degree

90% of memory compared to the conventional implementations of fully-connected

from an error probability perspective, the construction of
information-theoretically secure codes over such channels remains an open
problem. In this paper, we consider a fading wiretap channel model where the
transmitter has only partial statistical channel state information. Our channel
model includes static channels, i.i.d. block fading channels, and ergodic
stationary fading with fast decay of large deviations for the eavesdropper's
channel.
  We extend the flatness factor criterion from the Gaussian wiretap channel to
fading and MIMO wiretap channels, and establish a simple design criterion where
the normalized product distance / minimum determinant of the lattice and its
dual should be maximized simultaneously.
  Moreover, we propose concrete lattice codes satisfying this design criterion,
which are built from algebraic number fields with constant root discriminant in
the single-antenna case, and from division algebras centered at such number
fields in the multiple-antenna case. The proposed lattice codes achieve strong
secrecy and semantic security for all rates $R<C_b-C_e-\kappa$, where $C_b$ and
$C_e$ are Bob and Eve's channel capacities respectively, and $\kappa$ is an
explicit constant gap. Furthermore, these codes are almost universal in the
sense that a fixed code is good for secrecy for a wide range of fading models.
  Finally, we consider a compound wiretap model with a more restricted
uncertainty set, and show that rates $R<\bar{C}_b-\bar{C}_e-\kappa$ are
achievable, where $\bar{C}_b$ is a lower bound for Bob's capacity and
$\bar{C}_e$ is an upper bound for Eve's capacity for all the channels in the

Hamiltonians that are Hermitian. Here we extend the $CPT$ theorem to quantum
field theories with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Our derivation is a quite
minimal one as it requires only the time independent evolution of scalar
products and invariance under complex Lorentz transformations. The first of
these requirements does not force the Hamiltonian to be Hermitian. Rather, it
forces its eigenvalues to either be real or to appear in complex conjugate
pairs, forces the eigenvectors of such conjugate pairs to be conjugates of each
other, and forces the Hamiltonian to admit of an antilinear symmetry. The
latter requirement then forces this antilinear symmetry to be $CPT$, with
Hermiticity of a Hamiltonian thus only being a sufficient condition for $CPT$
symmetry and not a necessary one. $CPT$ symmetry thus has primacy over
Hermiticity, and it rather than Hermiticity should be taken as a guiding
principle for constructing quantum theories. With conformal gravity being a
non-Hermitian theory, our approach allows us to construct a positive,
ghost-free norm for the theory, to thereby establish the unitarity of conformal
gravity. Since our approach allows for complex energies and decays, our work
justifies the use of the $CPT$ theorem in establishing the equality of the
lifetimes of unstable particles that are charge conjugates of each other. In
the quantum-mechanical limit where charge conjugation is separately conserved,
the key results of the $PT$ symmetry program of Bender and collaborators are
recovered.

modification is a simple treatment of the microscopic interface potential

Compared to experimental results in nine water--co-solvent mixtures, SLIC
predicts transfer free energies to within 2.5 kJ/mol. The co-solvents include
both protic and aprotic species, as well as biologically relevant denaturants

reproduced with the $\eta'N$ FSI. The cross section at backward angles can also
be a good probe to investigate the strength of the $\eta'N$ interaction.

R\'enyi and Tsallis entropy. It has many common properties with them, on the
other hand, some aspects as e.g., MaxEnt distributions, are completely
different from the former two entropies. In this paper, we demonstrate the
statistical properties of hybrid entropy, including the definition of hybrid
entropy for continuous distributions, its relation to discrete entropy and
calculation of hybrid entropy for some well-known distributions. Additionally,
definition of hybrid divergence and its connection to Fisher metric is also
discussed. Interestingly, the main properties of continuous hybrid entropy and
hybrid divergence are completely different from measures based on R\'enyi and
Tsallis entropy. This motivates us to introduce average hybrid entropy, which
can be understood as an average between Tsallis and R\'enyi entropy.

different technological devices: a magnetic core and a parallel plate
(symmetrical or asymmetrical) capacitor. From experimental measurements on both
devices, we detected small raised anomalous forces that cannot be explained by
known interactions in the traditional theories. As the variations of device
inertia have not been completely understood by means of current theories, we
here propose a theoretical framework in which the anomalous effects can
consistently be explained by a preexisting state of quantum entanglement
between the external environment and either magnetic dipoles of magnetic cores
or electric dipoles of capacitors, so that the effects would be manifested by
the application of a strong magnetic field on the former or an intense electric
field on the latter. The values of the macroscopic observables calculated in
such a theoretical framework revealed good agreement with the experimental
measurements performed in both cases, so that the non - locality hypothesis
based on the generalized quantum correlation between dipoles and environment is
consistent as explanation for the anomalous effects observed. The control and
enhancement of the effect can allow the future viability of a new technology
based on electric propulsion of rockets and aircrafts.

galaxy pairs from the Uppsala Galaxy Catalog (UGC), using accurate radial
velocities. The UGC lists 12921 galaxies to declination larger than -2 deg 30
min and is complete to an apparent diameter of 1 arcmin. The criteria used to
define the isolated galaxy pairs are the following: 1) Velocity criterion:
radial velocity difference between the members lower than 500 km/s; 2)
Interdistance criterion: projected distance between the members smaller than 1
Mpc; 3) Reciprocity criterion: each member is the closest galaxy to the other
one, which excludes multiplets; 4) Isolation information: the catalog lists the
ratio between the projected distance to the closest UGC galaxy (having a
velocity difference smaller than 500 km/s) and the pair members interdistance,
thus allowing one to choose any isolation criterion (beyond the chosen limit
2.5). In addition, we have accounted for the small diameter bias by searching
for CGCG galaxies in the pair environment and used the same isolation
criterion. A peculiar investigation has allowed to gather very accurate radial
velocities for pair members, from high quality HI and optical measurements
(median uncertainty on velocity differences 10 km/s). Our final catalog
contains 1005 galaxy pairs. Then we give some global properties of the pair
catalog. We display the histograms of the radial velocity differences between
the pair members and of their projected interdistances (median 0.29 Mpc).
Finally, we provide an estimate of the contamination by cosmological false
""pairs"", which is about 10 percent up to a velocity difference of 380 km/s,
beyond which all pairs are probably false.

by means of a carbon fiber brush, while the cathodes were realized through a
graphite-based porous ceramic disk with Nafion membranes (117 Dupont). The
performances in terms of polarization curves and power production were assessed
according to different operating conditions: percentage of solid substrate
water dilution, adoption of freshwater and a 35mg/L NaCl water solution and,
finally, the effect of an initial potentiostatic growth.
  All TMFCs operated at low pH (pH$=3.0 \pm 0.5$), as no pH amendment was
carried out. Despite the harsh environmental conditions, our TMFCs showed a
Power Density (PD) ranging from 20 to 55~mW/m$^2 \cdot$kg$_{\text{waste}}$ and
a maximum CD of 20~mA/m$^2 \cdot$kg$_{\text{waste}}$, referred to the cathodic
surface. COD removal after a $28-$day period was about $45 \%$.
  The remarkably low pH values as well as the fouling of Nafion membrane very
likely limited TMFC performances. However, a scale-up estimation of our
reactors provides interesting values in terms of power production, compared to
actual anaerobic digestion plants. These results encourage further studies to
characterize the graphite-based porous ceramic cathodes and to optimize the
global TMFC performances, as they may provide a valid and sustainable
alternative to anaerobic digestion technologies.
