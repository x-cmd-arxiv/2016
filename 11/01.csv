two main classes of models: biologically grounded spiking neurons and
functionally inspired rate-based units. The unified simulation framework
presented here supports the combination of the two for multi-scale modeling
approaches, the quantitative validation of mean-field approaches by spiking
network simulations, and an increase in reliability by usage of the same
simulation code and the same network model specifications for both model
classes. While most efficient spiking simulations rely on the communication of
discrete events, rate models require time-continuous interactions between
neurons. Exploiting the conceptual similarity to the inclusion of gap junctions
in spiking network simulations, we arrive at a reference implementation of
instantaneous and delayed interactions between rate-based models in a spiking
network simulator. The separation of rate dynamics from the general connection
and communication infrastructure ensures flexibility of the framework. We
further demonstrate the broad applicability of the framework by considering
various examples from the literature ranging from random networks to neural
field models. The study provides the prerequisite for interactions between
rate-based and spiking models in a joint simulation.

However, the hurdle of actually implementing the necessary quantum probe states

is usually not taken into account. We show that for a wide range of tasks in
metrology, 2D cluster states (a particular family of states useful for

allow one to efficiently prepare any required state for sensing, and perform
appropriate (entangled) measurements using only single qubit operations.
Crucially, the overhead in the number of qubits is less than quadratic, thus
preserving the quantum scaling advantage. This is ensured by using a
compression to a logarithmically sized space that contains all relevant
information for sensing. We specifically demonstrate how our method can be used
to obtain optimal scaling for phase and frequency estimation in local
estimation problems, as well as for the Bayesian equivalents with Gaussian
priors of varying widths. Furthermore, we show that in the paradigmatic case of
local phase estimation 1D cluster states are sufficient for optimal state

demonstrate that an approximate algorithm can be nearly two orders of magnitude

using an approximate k-NN search can be more effective and efficient than the
term-based pipeline. This opens up new possibilities for designing effective
retrieval pipelines. Our software (including data-generating code) and

energy transfer between the coupled modes, one being excited by spin transfer

dominant MAC protocol for high data-rate PLC, the IEEE 1901, employs a CSMA/CA
mechanism similar to the backoff process of 802.11. Existing performance
evaluation studies of this protocol assume that the backoff processes of the
stations are independent (the so-called decoupling assumption). However, in
contrast to 802.11, 1901 stations can change their state after sensing the
medium busy, which is regulated by the so-called deferral counter. This
mechanism introduces strong coupling between the stations and, as a result,
makes existing analyses inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a performance
model for 1901, which does not rely on the decoupling assumption. We prove that
our model admits a unique solution for a wide range of configurations and
confirm the accuracy of the model using simulations. Our results show that we
outperform current models based on the decoupling assumption. In addition to
evaluating the performance in steady state, we further study the transient
dynamics of 1901, which is also affected by the deferral counter.

long-ranged non-equilibrium concentration fluctuations (NCF) appear as a

study the interplay between NCF and critical ECF in a near critical mixture
aniline/cyclohexane in the presence of a vertical concentration gradient. To
this aim, we exploit a commercial optical microscope and a simple, custom-made,
temperature-controlled cell to obtain simultaneous static and dynamic
scattering information on the fluctuations. We first characterise the critical
ECF at fixed temperature $T$ above the upper critical solution temperature
$T_{c}$, in the wide temperature range $T-T_{c}\in[0.1,30]$ $^{o}$C. In this
range, we observe the expected critical scaling behaviour for both the
scattering intensity and the mass diffusion coefficient and we determine the
critical exponents $\gamma$, $\nu$ and $\eta$, which are found in agreement
with the 3D Ising values. We then study the system in the two-phase region
($T<T_{c}$). In particular, we characterise the interplay between ECF and NCF
when the mixture, initially at a temperature $T_{i}$, is rapidly brought to a
temperature $T_{f}>T_{i}$. During the transient, a vertical diffusive mass flux
is present that causes the onset of NCF, whose amplitude vanishes with time, as
the flux goes to zero. We also study the time dependence of the equilibrium
scattering intensity $I_{eq}$, of the crossover wave-vector $q_{co}$ and of the
diffusion coefficient $D$ during diffusion and find that all these quantities
exhibit an exponential relaxation enslaved to the diffusive kinetics.

energies of triplet state Ti(II)Pc and their tailored peripheral substituted

the charge mobility. Chlorine substituted complex demonstrates higher electron
hopping rate due to higher electronic coupling in comparison to other halogens.
Similarly, weak electron-donating methyl group increases the electron transport
rate. Moreover, halogen substituted Ti(II)Pc complexes elucidate lower
reorganization energies. The lowest reorganization energy is predicted for

estimated using an exact non- linear Bayesian filter. We compute posterior

Consequently, blood cells have evolved a special morphology and a specific
internal architecture allowing them to maintain their integrity over several
weeks. For instance, non-mammalian red blood cells, mammalian erythroblasts and
platelets have a peripheral ring of microtubules, called the marginal band,
that flattens the overall cell morphology by pushing on the cell cortex. In
this article, we model how the shape of these cells stems from the balance
between marginal band elasticity and cortical tension. We predict that the
diameter of the cell scales with the total microtubule polymer, and verify the
predicted law across a wide range of species. Our analysis also shows that the
combination of the marginal band rigidity and cortical tension increases the
ability of the cell to withstand forces without deformation. Finally, we model
the marginal band coiling that occurs during the disc-to-sphere transition
observed for instance at the onset of blood platelet activation. We show that
when cortical tension increases faster than crosslinkers can unbind, the
marginal band will coil, whereas if the tension increases slower, the marginal
band may shorten as microtubules slide relative to each other.

sections up to recent LHC results and cosmic ray experiments. We present here a
comprehensive review - written with a historical perspective - about total
cross-sections from medium to the highest energies explored experimentally and
studied through a variety of methods and theoretical models for over sixty
years. We begin by recalling the analytic properties of the elastic amplitude
and the theorems about the asymptotic behavior of the total cross-section. A
discussion of how proton-proton cross-sections are extracted from cosmic rays
at higher than accelerator energies and help the study of these asymptotic
limits, is presented. This is followed by a description of the advent of
particle colliders, through which high energies and unmatched experimental
precisions have been attained. Thus the measured hadronic elastic and total
cross-sections have become crucial instruments to probe the so called soft part
of QCD physics, where quarks and gluons are confined, and have led to test and
refine Regge behavior and a number of diffractive models. As the c.m. energy
increases, the total cross-section also probes the transition into hard
scattering describable with perturbative QCD, the so-called mini-jet region.
Further tests are provided by cross-section measurements of gamma p, gamma*p
and gamma* gamma* for models based on vector meson dominance, scaling limits of
virtual photons at high Q^2 and the BFKL formalism. Models interpolating from
virtual to real photons are also tested.

  Physics. 84 pages, 30 figures",,"10.1007/s41116-016-0005-2",,"astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Since the early 1970s, inversion techniques have become the most useful tool
for inferring the magnetic, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties of the solar
atmosphere. The intrinsic model dependence makes it necessary to formulate
specific means that include the physics in a properly quantitative way. The
core of this physics lies in the radiative transfer equation (RTE), where the
properties of the atmosphere are assumed to be known while the unknowns are the
four Stokes profiles. The solution of the (differential) RTE is known as the
direct or forward problem. From an observational point of view, the problem is
rather the opposite: the data are made up of the observed Stokes profiles and
the unknowns are the solar physical quantities. Inverting the RTE is therefore
mandatory. Indeed, the formal solution of this equation can be considered an
integral equation. The solution of such an integral equation is called the
inverse problem. Inversion techniques are automated codes aimed at solving the
inverse problem.
  The foundations of inversion techniques are critically revisited with an
emphasis on making explicit the many assumptions underlying each of them. An
incremental complexity procedure is advised for the implementation in practice.
Coarse details of the profiles or coarsely sam- pled profiles should be
reproduced first with simple model atmospheres (with, for example, a few
physical quantities that are constant with optical depth). If the Stokes
profiles are well sampled and differences between synthetic and observed ones
are greater than the noise, then the inversion should proceed by using more
complex models (that is, models where physical quantities vary with depth or,
eventually, with more than one component). Significant im- provements are
expected as well from the use of new inversion techniques that take the spatial
degradation by the instruments into account.

sciences. However, traditionally it has been studied using proxies

statistical techniques to analyse geolocalised speech recordings and to explore
the spatial variation of pronunciations continuously over the region of
interest, as opposed to traditional isoglosses, which provide a discrete
partition of the region. Data of this type require an explicit modeling of the
variation in the mean and the covariance. Usual Euclidean metrics are not
appropriate, and we therefore introduce the concept of $d$-covariance, which
allows consistent estimation both in space and at individual locations. We then
propose spatial smoothing for these objects which accounts for the possibly non
convex geometry of the domain of interest. We apply the proposed method to data
from the spoken part of the British National Corpus, deposited at the British
Library, London, and we produce maps of the dialect variation over Great
Britain. In addition, the methods allow for acoustic reconstruction across the
domain of interest, allowing researchers to listen to the statistical analysis.

spectral distortions and primordial nucleosynthesis bounds, which dominate at

using the lifetime of a decaying particle as proxy. We identify a suitable
on-the-spot approximation. Our results are of interest not only for early

other exotic injection of e.m. radiation. For illustration, we apply our

showing that the constraints are comparable to the ones obtained from gamma-ray
background studies and even dominate below $\sim 10^{14}$g. ii) To a peculiar

moderate mass enhancement of order $\sim$2. This value decreases if the ordered
moment grows as a result of a stronger interaction. The antiferromagnetic phase
diagram for this $d^4$ shows similarities with that calculated for the $d^6$
systems. Correspondingly, in the paramagnetic phase the influence of the
half-filled Mott insulator shows up as a crossover from a weakly correlated to
an orbitally differentiated ""Hund's metal"" phase which reflects an analogous
phenomenon in $d^6$ iron compounds including a strong enhancement of the
compressibility in a zone just inside the frontier between the normal and the
Hund's metal. The experimental evidence and our theoretical description place
BaCr$_2$As$_2$ at interaction strength slightly below the crossover which
implies that negative pressures and/or electron doping (e.g. Cr $\rightarrow$
Mn,Fe or Ba $\rightarrow$ Sc,Y,La) might strongly enhance the compressibility,
thereby possibly inducing a pairing instability in this non-superconducting
compound.

stress. However, laboratory and numerical experiments suggest the coexistence
of distinct ""fluid"" and ""impact"" thresholds for the initiation and cessation of
aeolian saltation, respectively. Because aeolian transport models typically use
only the fluid threshold, existence of a separate lower impact threshold
complicates the prediction of wind-driven transport. Here, we derive the first
field-based estimates of distinct fluid and impact thresholds from
high-frequency saltation measurements at three field sites. Our measurements
show that, when saltation is mostly inactive, its instantaneous occurrence is
governed primarily by wind exceedance of the fluid threshold. As saltation
activity increases, so too does the relative importance of the impact
threshold, until it dominates under near-continuous transport conditions.
Although both thresholds are thus important for high-frequency saltation
prediction, we find that the time-averaged saltation flux is primarily governed
by impact threshold.

observations of NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) inversion transitions with the Green Bank
Telescope. Detailed modeling of the NH3 lines reveals that the kinematics of
the cluster and surrounding filaments are complex. We identify hierarchical
structure using a dendrogram analysis of the NH3 emission. The distance between
neighbour structures that are embedded within the same parent structure is
generally greater than expected from a spherical Jeans analysis, and is in
better agreement with cylindrical fragmentation models. The NH3 line width-size
relation is flat, and average gas motions are sub- or trans-sonic over all
physical scales observed. Subsonic regions extend far beyond the typical 0.1 pc
scale previously identified in star-forming cores. As a result, we find a
strong trend of decreasing virial parameter with increasing structure mass in
Serpens South. Extremely low virial parameters on the largest scales probed by
our data suggest that the previously observed, ordered magnetic field is
insufficient to support the region against collapse, in agreement with large
radial infall motions previously measured toward some of the filaments. A more
complex magnetic field configuration in the dense gas, however, may be able to
support the filaments.

more tidal energy than the <1 GW of the Moon and Mars. Icy ocean worlds also
should create less thermal noise for a due to their greater distance and

as the last component $\lambda_N$ of a random partition under a specific $t=0$

$\mathbf{x}_N:=\lambda_N-N$ can be identified with the location of the $N$th

neutrino masses and mixing angles. The latter was proposed on the basis of an
assumed complex-extended scaling property of the neutrino Majorana mass matrix
$M_\nu$, derived with a type-1 seesaw from a Dirac mass matrix $m_D$ and a
heavy singlet neutrino Majorana mass matrix $M_R$. One of its important
features, highlighted here, is that there is a common source of the origin of a
nonzero $\theta_{13}$ and the CP violating lepton asymmetry through the
imaginary part of $m_D$. The model predicted CP violation to be maximal for the
Dirac type and vanishing for the Majorana type. We assume strongly hierarchical
mass eigenvalues for $M_R$. The leptonic CP asymmetry parameter
$\varepsilon^\alpha_{1}\hspace{1mm}$ with lepton flavor $\alpha$, originating
from the decays of the lightest of the heavy neutrinos $N_1$ (of mass $M_1$) at
a temperature $T\sim M_1$, is what matters here with
$\varepsilon^\alpha_{2,3}$, originating from the decays of $N_{2,3}$, being
washed out. The light leptonic and heavy neutrino number densities (normalized
to the entropy density) are evolved via Boltzmann equations down to electroweak
temperatures to yield a baryon asymmetry through sphaleronic transitions. The
effect of flavored vs. unflavored leptogenesis in the three mass regimes (1)
$M_1<10^{9}$ GeV, (2) $10^9$ GeV $<M_1<$ $10^{12}$ GeV and (3) $M_1>10^{12}$

of the light neutrinos. Corresponding results on the baryon asymmetry of the

invariants of data called barcodes (also known as persistence diagrams). A
barcode is simply a multiset of real intervals. Recent work of Edelsbrunner,
Jablonski, and Mrozek suggests an equivalent description of barcodes as
functors R -> Mch, where R is the poset category of real numbers and Mch is the
category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are matchings (i.e.,
partial injective functions). Such functors form a category Mch^R whose
morphisms are the natural transformations. Thus, this interpretation of
barcodes gives us a hitherto unstudied categorical structure on barcodes. The
aim of this note is to show that this categorical structure leads to
surprisingly simple reformulations of both the well-known stability theorem for
persistent homology and a recent generalization called the induced matching
theorem.

investigate dynamical patterns induced by inhomogeneous bending for a two phase

tumbling mechanisms that cannot be observed for a homogeneous vesicle. In
particular, unlike the well-known steady tank-treading dynamics characterized
by a fixed inclination angle, here the phase-treading mechanism leads to
unsteady periodic dynamics with an oscillatory inclination angle. When the
average phase concentration is around 1/2, we observe tumbling dynamics even
for very low shear rate, and the excess length required for tumbling is
significantly smaller than the value for the single phase case. We summarize
our results in phase diagrams in terms of the excess length, shear rate, and
concentration of the soft phase. These findings go beyond the well known
dynamical regimes of a homogeneous vesicle and highlight the level of
complexity of vesicle dynamics in a fluid due to heterogeneous material
properties.

near-infrared wavelengths, reaching an angular resolution of ~0.02"", and an
inner working angle of ~0.09"". We detect polarized scattered light up to ~0.42""
(~48 au) and detect a cavity, a rim with azimuthal brightness variations at an
inclination of 38 degrees, two shadows and two symmetric spiral arms. The
spiral arms originate near the location of the shadows, close to the semi major
axis. We detect a faint spiral-like feature in the SW that can be interpreted
as the scattering surface of the bottom side of the disk, if the disk is
tidally truncated by the M-dwarf companion currently seen at a projected
distance of ~119 au. We construct a radiative transfer model that accounts for
the main characteristics of the features with an inner and outer disk
misaligned by ~72 degrees. The azimuthal brightness variations along the rim
are well reproduced with the scattering phase function of the model. While
spirals can be triggered by the tidal interaction with the companion, the close
proximity of the spirals to the shadows suggests that the shadows could also
play a role. The change in stellar illumination along the rim, induces an
azimuthal variation of the scale height that can contribute to the brightness
variations. Dark regions in polarized images of transition disks are now
detected in a handful of disks and often interpreted as shadows due to a
misaligned inner disk. The origin of such a misalignment in HD 100453, and of
the spirals, is unclear, and might be due to a yet-undetected massive companion
inside the cavity, and on an inclined orbit.

site for optical, NIR, and THz astronomical observations. GATTINI was a
wide-field camera installed on the PLATO instrument module as part of the
Chinese-led traverse to Dome A in January, 2009. We present here the
measurements of sky brightness with the Gattini ultra-large field of view (90
deg x 90 deg) in the photometric B-, V-, and R-bands, cloud cover statistics
measured during the 2009 winter season, and an estimate of the sky
transparency. A cumulative probability distribution indicates that the darkest
10% of the nights at Dome A have sky brightness of S_B = 22.98, S_V = 21.86,
and S_R = 21.68 mag arcsec^{-2}. These values were obtained around the year
2009 with minimum aurora, and they are comparable to the faintest sky
brightness at Mauna Kea and the best sites of northern Chile. Since every
filter includes strong auroral lines that effectively contaminate the sky
brightness measurements, for instruments working around the auroral lines,
either with custom filters or with high spectral resolution instruments, these
values could be easily obtained on a more routine basis. In addition, we
present example light curves for bright targets to emphasize the unprecedented
observational window function available from this ground-based site. These
light curves will be published in a future paper.

(EoR), when the neutral intergalactic medium was ionized by the energetic
photons emitted from the first galaxies. The [CII] 158$\mu$m fine-structure
line is typically one of the brightest emission lines of star-forming galaxies
and thus a promising tracer of the global EoR star-formation activity. However,
[CII] intensity maps at $6 \lesssim z \lesssim 8$ are contaminated by
interloping CO rotational line emission ($3 \leq J_{\rm upp} \leq 6$) from
lower-redshift galaxies. Here we present a strategy to remove the foreground
contamination in upcoming [CII] intensity mapping experiments, guided by a
model of CO emission from foreground galaxies. The model is based on empirical
measurements of the mean and scatter of the total infrared luminosities of
galaxies at $z < 3$ and with stellar masses $M_{*} > 10^{8}\,\rm M_{\rm \odot}$
selected in $K$-band from the COSMOS/UltraVISTA survey, which can be converted
to CO line strengths. For a mock field of the Tomographic Ionized-carbon
Mapping Experiment (TIME), we find that masking out the ""voxels""
(spectral-spatial elements) containing foreground galaxies identified using an
optimized CO flux threshold results in a $z$-dependent criterion $m^{\rm

model predict a population of subhalos within Galactic halos that have higher
central densities than inferred for satellites of the Milky Way, a tension
known as the `too big to fail' problem. Proposed solutions include baryonic
effects, a smaller mass for the Milky Way halo, and warm dark matter. We test
these three possibilities using a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation to
generate luminosity functions for Milky Way halo-analogue satellite
populations, the results of which are then coupled to the Jiang & van den Bosch
model of subhalo stripping to predict the subhalo $V_\mathrm{max}$ functions
for the 10 brightest satellites. We find that selecting the brightest
satellites (as opposed to the most massive) and modelling the expulsion of gas
by supernovae at early times increases the likelihood of generating the
observed Milky Way satellite $V_\mathrm{max}$ function. The preferred halo mass
is $6\times10^{11}M_{\odot}$, which has a 14 percent probability to host a
$V_\mathrm{max}$ function like that of the Milky Way satellites. This
probability is reduced to 8 percent for a $1.0\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$ halo and
to 3 percent for a $1.4\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$ halo. We conclude that the Milky
Way satellite $V_\mathrm{max}$ function is compatible with a CDM cosmology, as
previously found by Sawala et al. using hydrodynamic simulations. Sterile
neutrino-warm dark matter models achieve a higher degree of agreement with the
observations, with a maximum 35 percent chance of generating the observed Milky
Way satellite $V_\mathrm{max}$ function. However, more work is required to
check that the semi-analytic stripping model is calibrated correctly in the
sterile neutrino cosmology, and to check if our sterile neutrino models produce
sufficient numbers of faint satellites.

is predicted to be the brightest among the HI lines under high dust-extinction

stars and so is used as an indicator of star formation on the assumption of the

luminosity of the line (L_BrA) correlates well with that of the 3.3 micron PAH
emission (L_3.3). Thus we utilize L_3.3 as an indicator of star formation in
fainter objects where the Br-alpha line is undetected. The mean L_BrA/L_IR
ratio in LINERs/Seyferts is significantly lower than that in HII galaxies. This
difference is reconfirmed with the L_3.3/L_IR ratio in the larger sample (46
galaxies). Using the ratios, we estimate that the contribution of starburst in
LINERs/Seyferts is ~67%, and active galactic nuclei contribute to the remaining
~33%. However, comparing the number of ionizing photons, Q_BrA, derived from
L_BrA with that, Q_IR, expected from star formation rate required to explain
L_IR, we find that the mean Q_BrA/Q_IR ratio is only 55.5+/-7.5% even in HII

ionizing photons traced by the Br-alpha line is significant even taking heavy

show that the sources form a distinct population of massive, compact galaxies
at redshifts $0.4 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.7$, lying systematically below the
size-mass relation of the global elliptical galaxy population at those

to investigate the structural properties, stellar masses and stellar
populations of these objects with a view to understanding their evolution. We
model these objects parametrically and find that they generally require two
S\'ersic components to properly describe their light profiles, with one more
spheroidal component alongside a more envelope-like component, which is
slightly more extended though still compact. This is consistent with the
hypothesis of the inside-out growth of these objects via minor mergers. We also
find that the sources can be characterised by red-to-blue colour gradients as a
function of radius which are stronger at low redshift -- indicative of ongoing

paradigm that Yukawa couplings are, rather than fundamental constants,
effective low energy couplings radiatively generated by interactions in a
hidden sector of the theory. In the present paper we show that the setup
required by this scenario can be set by gauge invariance alone, provided that
the Standard Model gauge group be extended to the left-right symmetric group of
$SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_Y$. The simplest scheme in which Yukawa
couplings are forbidden at the tree-level organises the right-handed fermions
into doublets and presents an additional Higgs $SU(2)_R$ doublet, responsible
for the spontaneous breaking of the $SU(2)_R$ gauge sector. The flavor and
chiral symmetry breaking induced by the $SU(2)_R$ breaking is transferred at
the one-loop level to the Standard Model via the dynamics of the hidden sector,
which effectively regulates the spread of the effective Yukawa couplings. The
emerging left-right symmetric framework recovers additional appealing features
typical of these models, allowing for instance to identify the hypercharges of
the involved fermions with their $B-L$ charges and offering a straightforward
solution to the strong CP problem. The scheme gives rise to a distinguishing
phenomenology that potentially can be tested at the LHC and future colliders
through the same interactions that result in the radiative generation of Yukawa
couplings, as well as by exploiting the properties of the additional $SU(2)_R$

information processing. It is often achieved by designing specific transport
channels in a suitable material. Topological metamaterials offer a way to
construct stable and efficient channels of unprecedented versatility. However,
due to their stability it can be tricky to terminate them or to temporarily
shut them off without changing the material properties massively. While a lot
of effort was put into realizing mechanical topological metamaterials, almost
no works deal with manipulating their edge channels in sight of applications.
Here, we take a step in this direction, by taking advantage of local symmetry
breaking potentials to build a switchable topological phonon channel.

during the closest fly-by over the comet, which took place on 14 th February
2015 at a distance of {\~} 6 km from the surface. Several images covering the
0{\deg}-33{\deg} phase angle range were acquired, and the spatial resolution
achieved was 11 cm/pxl. The flown-by region is located on the big lobe of the
comet, near the borders of the Ash, Apis and Imhotep regions. Our analysis
shows that this region features local heterogeneities at the decimetre scale.
We observed difference of reflectance up to 40{\%} between bright spots and
sombre regions, and spectral slope variations up to 50{\%}. The spectral
reddening effect observed globally on the comet surface by Fornasier et al.
(2015) is also observed locally on this region, but with a less steep
behaviour. We note that numerous metre-sized boulders, which exhibit a smaller
opposition effect, also appear spectrally redder than their surroundings. In
this region, we found no evidence linking observed bright spots to exposed
water-ice-rich material. We fitted our dataset using the Hapke 2008 photometric
model. The region overflown is globally as dark as the whole nucleus (geometric
albedo of 6.8{\%}) and it has a high porosity value in the uppermost-layers
(86{\%}). These results of the photometric analysis at a decimetre scale
indicate that the photometric properties of the flown-by region are similar to
those previously found for the whole nucleus.

As a result, Planet Nine may be detectable at 3.4$\mu$m with WISE, but single

430$ AU). We develop a method to search for Planet Nine far beyond the W1

methodology to $\sim$2000 square degrees of sky identified by Holman & Payne

and powerful black hole activity in the form of both intense quasar radiation
and radio jets. The radio jets have inflated huge bubbles filled with

fundamental limits of the caching systems, which are significantly different
from the conventional analytical approach usually seen in the information
theory literature. The linear programming (LP) outer bound of the entropy space
serves as the starting point of this approach; however, our effort goes
significantly beyond using it to prove information inequalities. We first
identify and formalize the symmetry structure in the problem, which enables us
to show the existence of optimal symmetric solutions. A symmetry-reduced linear
program is then used to identify the boundary of the memory-transmission-rate
tradeoff for several small cases, for which we obtain a set of tight outer
bounds. General hypotheses on the optimal tradeoff region are formed from these
computed data, which are then analytically proven. This leads to a complete
characterization of the optimal tradeoff for systems with only two users, and
certain partial characterization for systems with only two files. Next, we show
that by carefully analyzing the joint entropy structure of the outer bounds for
certain cases, a novel code construction can be reverse-engineered, which
eventually leads to a general class of codes. Finally, we show that outer
bounds can be computed through strategically relaxing the LP in different ways,
which can be used to explore the problem computationally. This allows us
firstly to deduce generic characteristic of the converse proof, and secondly to
compute outer bounds for larger problem cases, despite the seemingly impossible
computation scale.

us to account for the fraction of Z < Zcrit stars formed even in regions in
which the gas' average metallicity is well above Zcrit. We demonstrate that
such partially-mixed regions account for 0.5 to 0.7 of all Pop III stars formed
up to z = 5. Additionally, we track the creation and transport of ""primordial

  Regression","Paper Accepted in Statistical Modelling",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new approach to a linear-circular regression problem that
relates multiple linear predictors to a circular response. We follow a modeling
approach of a wrapped normal distribution that describes angular variables and
angular distributions and advances it for a linear-circular regression
analysis. Some previous works model a circular variable as projection of a
bivariate Gaussian random vector on the unit square, and the statistical
inference of the resulting model involves complicated sampling steps. The
proposed model treats circular responses as the result of the modulo operation
on unobserved linear responses. The resulting model is a mixture of multiple
linear-linear regression models. We present two EM algorithms for maximum
likelihood estimation of the mixture model, one for a parametric model and
another for a non-parametric model. The estimation algorithms provide a great
trade-off between computation and estimation accuracy, which was numerically
shown using five numerical examples. The proposed approach was applied to a
problem of estimating wind directions that typically exhibit complex patterns
with large variation and circularity.

strong magnetoresistance in fields above Bc2(T), consistent with the observed
Kondo minimum seen above Tc. Fits to the temperature dependence in the context
of the WHH model, using the experimental value of the Maki parameter, require
an effective spin-orbit relaxation parameter of order unity. We suggest that

part of a previously derived weighted-residual procedure, to account for the
geometry of particle transport in a duct system (where particle migration into
the walls is not considered). Our model introduces two stochastic parameters to
account for particle-wall interactions: an albedo approximation yielding the
fraction of particles that return to the duct after striking the walls, and a
mean-distance travelled in the walls transverse to the duct by particles that
re-enter the duct. Our model produces a set of three transport equations with a
non-local scattering kernel. We solve these equations using discrete ordinates

but they are generally plagued by vanishing and exploding gradient problems.
Unitary recurrent neural networks (uRNNs), which use unitary recurrence
matrices, have recently been proposed as a means to avoid these issues.
However, in previous experiments, the recurrence matrices were restricted to be
a product of parameterized unitary matrices, and an open question remains: when
does such a parameterization fail to represent all unitary matrices, and how
does this restricted representational capacity limit what can be learned? To
address this question, we propose full-capacity uRNNs that optimize their
recurrence matrix over all unitary matrices, leading to significantly improved
performance over uRNNs that use a restricted-capacity recurrence matrix. Our
contribution consists of two main components. First, we provide a theoretical
argument to determine if a unitary parameterization has restricted capacity.
Using this argument, we show that a recently proposed unitary parameterization
has restricted capacity for hidden state dimension greater than 7. Second, we
show how a complete, full-capacity unitary recurrence matrix can be optimized
over the differentiable manifold of unitary matrices. The resulting
multiplicative gradient step is very simple and does not require gradient
clipping or learning rate adaptation. We confirm the utility of our claims by
empirically evaluating our new full-capacity uRNNs on both synthetic and
natural data, achieving superior performance compared to both LSTMs and the
original restricted-capacity uRNNs.

with electric field directed parallel to the external magnetic field. It is
found that the separate spin evolution modifies the spectrum of cyclotron
waves. These modifications increase with the increase of the spin polarization
and the number of the cyclotron resonance. Spin dynamics with no account of the
anomalous magnetic moment gives a considerable modification of spectra either.
The account of anomalous magnetic moment leads to a fine structure of each
cyclotron resonance. So, each cyclotron resonance splits on three waves.
Details of this spectrum and its changes with the change of spin polarization
are studied for the first and second cyclotron waves. A cyclotron resonance
existing at $\omega\approx0.001\mid\Omega_{e}\mid$ due to the anomalous
magnetic moment is also described, where $\mid\Omega_{e}\mid$ is the cyclotron
frequency. The ordinary waves does not have any considerable modification. The
electrostatic and electromagnetic Berstein modes are studied during the
analysis of waves propagating perpendicular to the external magnetic field with
the electric field perturbation directed perpendicular to the external field. A
modification of the oscillatory structure caused by the equilibrium spin
polarization is found in both regimes. Similar modification is found for the

beyond the water-ice sublimation limit of ~3 AU. Three bodies dominate the
observational record and modeling efforts for distantly active comets: the
long-period comet C/1995 O1 Hale-Bopp and the short-period comets (with Centaur
orbits) 29P/Schwassmann Wachmann 1 and 2060 Chiron. We summarize what is known
about these three objects emphasizing their gaseous comae. We calculate their
CN/CO and CO2/CO production rate ratios from the literature and discuss
implications. Using our own data we derive CO production rates for all three
objects, in order to examine a correlation between gas production and different
orbital histories and/or size. We find that orbital history does not appear to
play a significant role in explaining 29P's CO production rates. 29P
outproduces Hale-Bopp at the same heliocentric distance, even though it has
been subjected to much more solar heating. Previous modeling work on such
objects predicts that 29P should have been de-volatilized over a fresher comet
like Hale-Bopp. This may point to 29P having a different orbital history than
current models predict, with its current orbit acquired more recently. On the
other hand, Chiron's CO measurements are consistent with it being significantly
depleted over its original state, perhaps due to increased radiogenic heating
made possible by its much larger size or its higher processing due to orbital
history. Observed spectral line profiles are consistent with development and
sublimation of icy grains at about 5-6 AU for 29P and Hale-Bopp, and this is
probably a common feature in distantly active comets, and an important source
of volatiles for all comets within 5 AU. In contrast, the narrow CO line
profiles indicate a nuclear, and not extended, origin for CO beyond ~4 AU.

reported here draws upon a long-term study of scientific data practices to ask
questions about the durability and fragility of infrastructures for data in
astronomy. Methods include interviews, ethnography, and document analysis. As
astronomy has become a digital science, the community has invested in shared
instruments, data standards, digital archives, metadata and discovery services,
and other relatively durable infrastructure components. Several features of
data practices in astronomy contribute to the fragility of that infrastructure.
These include different archiving practices between ground- and space-based
missions, between sky surveys and investigator-led projects, and between
observational and simulated data. Infrastructure components are tightly
coupled, based on international agreements. However, the durability of these
infrastructures relies on much invisible work - cataloging, metadata, and other
labor conducted by information professionals. Continual investments in care and
maintenance of the human and technical components of these infrastructures are
necessary for sustainability.

construct a description of multivariate data for single-class classification
and outlier detection with various practical applications. Gaussian kernel used
in SVDD formulation allows flexible data description defined by observations
designated as support vectors. The data boundary of such description is
non-spherical and conforms to the geometric features of the data. By varying
the Gaussian kernel bandwidth parameter, the SVDD-generated boundary can be
made either smoother (more spherical) or tighter/jagged. The former case may
lead to under-fitting, whereas the latter may result in overfitting. Peak
criterion has been proposed to select an optimal value of the kernel bandwidth
to strike the balance between the data boundary smoothness and its ability to
capture the general geometric shape of the data. Peak criterion involves
training SVDD at various values of the kernel bandwidth parameter. When
training datasets are large, the time required to obtain the optimal value of
the Gaussian kernel bandwidth parameter according to Peak method can become
prohibitively large. This paper proposes an extension of Peak method for the
case of large data. The proposed method gives good results when applied to
several datasets. Two existing alternative methods of computing the Gaussian
kernel bandwidth parameter (Coefficient of Variation and Distance to the
Farthest Neighbor) were modified to allow comparison with the proposed method
on convergence. Empirical comparison demonstrates the advantage of the proposed
method.

GALEX-based methods suggest that $\sim$70% of the flux is obscured. This
increase in the obscured flux estimate is driven by significant differences
between the dust-free synthetic FUV flux and that derived when correcting the
observed FUV for dust with 24{\mu}m observations. The difference is further
illustrated when we compare the SFRs derived from the FUV+24{\mu}m flux with
the 100 Myr average SFR from the SFHs. The 24{\mu}m-corrected FUV flux
underestimates the SFR by a factor of $\sim$2.3 - 2.5. [abridged]

particle interactions and external forces, it can lead to highly complex
phenomena like fully developed turbulence, characterized by power law velocity
correlation functions. Yet despite decades of research, how these power laws
emerge from first principle remains unclear. Recently, experiments show that
when a Bose condensate is subjected to periodic shaking, its momentum
distribution exhibits a power law behavior. The flexibility of cold atom
experiments has provided new opportunities to explore the emergence of these
power laws, and to disentangle different sources of energy cascade. Here, we
point out that recent experiments in cold atoms imply that classical turbulence
is part of a larger family of scale invariant phenomena that include ideal
gases. Moreover, the property of the entire family is contained in the
structure of its Floquet states. For ideal gases, we show analytically that its
momentum distribution acquires a $1/q^2$ tail in each dimension when it is
shaken periodically.

new theorem showing that the $\mathrm{Beta}(\alpha,\beta)$ distribution is

These functions take values in the space Bil(V) of bilinear forms on a real

defined in terms of an analytic continuation of \psi to the strip { z \in C\: 0

However, these regressions are implemented with an algorithm which may not
converge on a solution. While convergence issues in linear mixed effects models
can often be addressed with careful experiment design and model building,
logistic mixed effects models introduce the possibility of separation or
quasi-separation, which can cause problems for model estimation that result in
convergence errors or in unreasonable model estimates. These problems cannot be
solved by experiment or model design. In this paper, we discuss
(quasi-)separation with the language researcher in mind, explaining what it is,
how it causes problems for model estimation, and why it can be expected in
linguistic datasets. Using real linguistic datasets, we then show how Bayesian
models can be used to overcome convergence issues introduced by
quasi-separation, whereas frequentist approaches fail. On the basis of these
demonstrations, we advocate for the adoption of Bayesian models as a practical
solution to dealing with convergence issues when modeling binary linguistic
data.

both the scale factor and BD scalar field are obtained in power-law forms (in

factor depends on not only the NC parameter but also the momentum conjugate
associated to the BD scalar field. For very small values of this parameter, we
obtain an appropriate inflationary solution, which can overcome the problems

Submitted to MNRAS. Comments welcome",,"10.1093/mnras/stw3229",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We discuss the mechanism of cluster formation in a numerical simulation of a
molecular cloud (MC) undergoing global hierarchical collapse (GHC). The global
nature of the collapse implies that the SFR increases over time. The
hierarchical nature of the collapse consists of small-scale collapses within
larger-scale ones. The large-scale collapses culminate a few Myr later than the
small-scale ones and consist of filamentary flows that accrete onto massive
central clumps. The small-scale collapses form clumps that are embedded in the
filaments and falling onto the large-scale collapse centers. The stars formed
in the early, small-scale collapses share the infall motion of their parent
clumps. Thus, the filaments feed both gaseous and stellar material to the
massive central clump. This leads to the presence of a few older stars in a
region where new protostars are forming, and also to a self-similar structure,
in which each unit is composed of smaller-scale sub-units that approach each
other and may merge. Because the older stars formed in the filaments share the
infall motion of the gas onto the central clump, they tend to have larger
velocities and to be distributed over larger areas than the younger stars
formed in the central clump. Finally, interpreting the IMF at face-value as a
probability distribution implies that massive stars only form once the {\it
local} SFR is large enough to sample the IMF up to high masses. In combination
with the increase of the SFR, this implies that massive stars tend to appear
late in the evolution of the MC, and only in the central massive clumps. We
discuss the correspondence of these features with observed properties of young
stellar clusters, finding very good qualitative agreement, thus providing
support to the scenario of global, hierarchical collapse of MCs, while
explaining the origin of the observed cluster structure.

we simulate the full infall trajectory of the Sgr progenitor from the time it
first crossed the Milky Way virial radius 8 Gyr ago. An exploration of the

currently employed to study large-scale self-assembly of these systems rely on
effective potentials between particles as calculated using equilibrium
statistical mechanics. In these approaches the kinetic aspects underlying the
formation of inter-particle linkages are neglected. We show how the rate at
which supramolecular linkages form drastically changes the self-assembly
pathway. In order to do this we develop a method that combines Brownian
dynamics simulations with a Gillespie algorithm accounting for the evolution of
inter-particle linkages. If compared with dynamics based on effective
potentials, an explicit description of inter-particle linkages results in
aggregates that in the early stages of self-assembly have a lower valency.
Relaxation towards equilibrium is hampered by the time required to break
existing linkages within one cluster and to reorient them toward free
particles. This effect is more important at low temperature and high particle
diffusion constant. Our results highlight the importance of including kinetic
rates into coarse-grained descriptions of ligand-receptor systems.

employed on RFID readers by keeping carrier signal and backscattered signal
apart in frequency. Finally, decoupling carrier generation from the reader and
using devices such as WiFi routers and sensor nodes as a source of the carrier
signal. An off-the-shelf implementation of LoRea costs 70 USD, a drastic

range scales with the carrier strength, and proximity to the carrier source and
achieves a maximum range of 3.4 kilometre when the tag is located at 1 meter

When the tag is equidistant from the carrier source and the receiver, we can

Here, we present the first results showing that a single subwavelength

particular, we experimentally demonstrate that two-photon entanglement can be
either completely preserved or completely lost after the interaction with the

We achieve this effect by using a specially engineered two photon state to
match the properties of the nanoaperture. The effect is fundamentally mediated

demonstrates an unprecedented control over light-matter interaction in the

blobs that were ejected sunward collided with the flare arcade. Some of them
collided or merged with each other before they were ejected from the current

(ejection, coalescence, and collision with the post flare loops). The radio
bursts are considered to be the gyrosynchrotron radiation by nonthermal high

is the network of shortcut edges present in a native-state protein (SCN0).
Although SCN0s are found via an intuitive message passing algorithm (S.

the logarithm form of their contact order (SCN0_lnCO) correlates significantly
with protein kinetic rates, regardless of protein size. Further, the clustering
coefficient of a SCN0 (CSCN0) can be used to combine protein segments
iteratively within the Restricted Binary Collision model to form the whole
native structure. This simple yet surprisingly effective strategy identified
reasonable folding pathways for 12 small single-domain two-state folders, and
three non-canonical proteins: ACBP (non-two-state), Top7 (non-cooperative) and
DHFR (non-single-domain, > 100 residues). For two-state folders, CSCN0 is
relatable to folding rates, transition-state placement and stability. The
influence of CSCN0 on folding extends to non-native structures. Moreover, SCN
analysis of non-native structures could suggest three fold success factors for
the fast folding Villin headpiece peptide. These results support the view of
protein folding as a bottom-up hierarchical process guided from above by
native-state topology, and could facilitate future constructive demonstrations

divergence measure used in our model check is a measure of how much beliefs

variational approximations as a way of relieving the computational burden is
suggested. The methods are compared in a number of examples with an alternative

is believed to command an essential role in galaxy evolution. The majority of
these SMBHs are in the radiative inefficient accretion phase where this
interplay remains elusive, but suggestively important, due to few observational
constraints. To remedy this, we directly fit 2-D hydrodynamic simulations to
Chandra observations of Sgr A* with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling,
self-consistently modelling the 2-D inflow-outflow solution for the first time.
We find the temperature and density at flow onset are consistent with the
origin of the gas in the stellar winds of massive stars in the vicinity of Sgr
A*. We place the first observational constraints on the angular momentum of the
gas and estimate the centrifugal radius, r$_c$ $\approx$ 0.056 r$_b$
$\approx8\times10^{-3}$ pc, where r$_b$ is the Bondi radius. Less than 1\% of
the inflowing gas accretes onto the SMBH, the remainder being ejected in a
polar outflow. For the first time, we decouple the quiescent point-like
emission from the spatially extended flow. We find this point-like emission,
accounting for $\sim4$\% of the quiescent flux, is spectrally too steep to be

Marques, Gonzalo Mateos, Alejandro Ribeiro","Rethinking Sketching as Sampling: A Graph Signal Processing Approach","Submitted to Elsevier Signal Processing",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sampling of signals belonging to a low-dimensional subspace has
well-documented merits for dimensionality reduction, limited memory storage,
and online processing of streaming network data. When the subspace is known,
these signals can be modeled as bandlimited graph signals. Most existing
sampling methods are designed to minimize the error incurred when
reconstructing the original signal from its samples. Oftentimes these
parsimonious signals serve as inputs to computationally-intensive linear
operators. Hence, interest shifts from reconstructing the signal itself towards
approximating the output of the prescribed linear operator efficiently. In this
context, we propose a novel sampling scheme that leverages graph signal
processing, exploiting the low-dimensional (bandlimited) structure of the input
as well as the transformation whose output we wish to approximate. We formulate
problems to jointly optimize sample selection and a sketch of the target linear
transformation, so when the latter is applied to the sampled input signal the
result is close to the desired output. Similar sketching as sampling ideas are
also shown effective in the context of linear inverse problems. Because these
designs are carried out off line, the resulting sampling plus
reduced-complexity processing pipeline is particularly useful for data that are
acquired or processed in a sequential fashion, where the linear operator has to
be applied fast and repeatedly to successive inputs or response signals.
Numerical tests showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms include
classification of handwritten digits from as few as 20 out of 784 pixels in the
input images and selection of sensors from a network deployed to carry out a
distributed parameter estimation task.

Ramsey pulses after a specific time determined by the state-dependent rotating
potential. The ultimate rotation sensitivity can be improved to the Heisenberg
limit if the initial internal degrees of freedom are entangled. By implementing
parity measurement, the ultimate measurement precision can be saturated and the

propose a pricing framework for interference management from the D2D users to
the cellular system, where the base station (BS) protects itself (or its
serving cellular users) by pricing the crosstier interference caused from the
D2D users. A Stackelberg game is formulated to model the interactions between
the BS and D2D users. Specifically, the BS sets prices to a maximize its
revenue (or any desired utility) subject to an interference temperature
constraint. For given prices, the D2D users competitively adapt their power
allocation strategies for individual utility maximization. We first analyze the
competition among the D2D users by noncooperative game theory and an iterative
based distributed power allocation algorithm is proposed. Then, depending on
how much network information the BS knows, we develop two optimal algorithms,
one for uniform pricing with limited network information and the other for
differentiated pricing with global network information. The uniform pricing
algorithm can be implemented by a fully distributed manner and requires minimum
information exchange between the BS and D2D users, and the differentiated
pricing algorithm is partially distributed and requires no iteration between
the BS and D2D users. Then a suboptimal differentiated pricing scheme is
proposed to reduce complexity and it can be implemented in a fully distributed

special Euclidean group: estimate the values of a set of poses given noisy
measurements of a subset of their pairwise relative transforms. This problem is
typically formulated as a maximum-likelihood estimation that requires solving a
nonconvex nonlinear program, which is computationally intractable in general.
Nevertheless, in this paper we present an algorithm that is able to efficiently
recover certifiably globally optimal solutions of this estimation problem in a
non-adversarial noise regime. The crux of our approach is the development of a
semidefinite relaxation of the maximum-likelihood estimation whose minimizer
provides the exact MLE so long as the magnitude of the noise corrupting the
available measurements falls below a certain critical threshold; furthermore,
whenever exactness obtains, it is possible to verify this fact a posteriori,
thereby certifying the optimality of the recovered estimate. We develop a
specialized optimization scheme for solving large-scale instances of this
semidefinite relaxation by exploiting its low-rank, geometric, and
graph-theoretic structure to reduce it to an equivalent optimization problem on
a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and then design a Riemannian
truncated-Newton trust-region method to solve this reduction efficiently. We
combine this fast optimization approach with a simple rounding procedure to
produce our algorithm, SE-Sync. Experimental evaluation on a variety of
simulated and real-world pose-graph SLAM datasets shows that SE-Sync is capable
of recovering globally optimal solutions when the available measurements are
corrupted by noise up to an order of magnitude greater than that typically
encountered in robotics applications, and does so at a computational cost that
scales comparably with that of direct Newton-type local search techniques.

we manually annotate all objects and regions over 7,650 uniformly sampled

object/region masks with eye-tracking data of multiple subjects. To the best of
our knowledge, it is currently the largest dataset for video-based salient

  Based on this dataset, this paper proposes an unsupervised baseline approach
for video-based SOD by using saliency-guided stacked autoencoders. In the
proposed approach, multiple spatiotemporal saliency cues are first extracted at
pixel, superpixel and object levels. With these saliency cues, stacked
autoencoders are unsupervisedly constructed which automatically infer a
saliency score for each pixel by progressively encoding the high-dimensional
saliency cues gathered from the pixel and its spatiotemporal neighbors.

extraction. However, the distribution is unknown, so it is difficult to use the
geodesic distance when comparing two samples. In practice, the current deep
embedding methods use the Euclidean distance for the training and test. On the
other hand, the manifold learning methods suggest to use the Euclidean distance
in the local range, combining with the graphical relationship between samples,
for approximating the geodesic distance. From this point of view, selecting
suitable positive i.e. intra-class) training samples within a local range is
critical for training the CNN embedding, especially when the data has large
intra-class variations. In this paper, we propose a novel moderate positive
sample mining method to train robust CNN for person re-identification, dealing

In this context, we present a client-server framework, where a client transmits
the signature of a face to be analyzed to the server, and, in return, the
server sends back various information describing the face e.g. is the person
male or female, is she/he bald, does he have a mustache, etc. We assume that a
client can compute one (or a combination) of visual features; from very simple
and efficient features, like Local Binary Patterns, to more complex and
computationally heavy, like Fisher Vectors and CNN based, depending on the

design a common universal representation such that a single merged signature is
transmitted to the server, whatever be the type and number of features computed
by the client, ensuring nonetheless an optimal performance. Our solution is
based on learning of a common optimal subspace for aligning the different face
features and merging them into a universal signature. We have validated the
proposed method on the challenging CelebA dataset, on which our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods when rich representation is
available at test time, while giving competitive performance when only simple
signatures (like LBP) are available at test time due to resource constraints on

pairing in gapless Dirac semimetals, which generates a finite gap and drives
semimetal-insulator quantum phase transition. This phenomenon is in close
analogy to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in high energy physics. In most
realistic Dirac semimetals, including suspended graphene, Coulomb interaction
is too weak to open an excitonic gap. The Coulomb interaction plays a more
important role at low energies in a two-dimensional semi-Dirac semimetal, in
which the fermion spectrum is linear in one component of momenta and quadratic
in the other, than a Dirac semimetal, and indeed leads to breakdown of Fermi
liquid theory. We study dynamical excitonic gap generation in a two-dimensional
semi-Dirac semimetal by solving the Dyson-Schwinger equation, and show that a
moderately strong Coulomb interaction suffices to induce excitonic pairing.
Additional short-range four-fermion coupling tends to promote excitonic
pairing. Among the available semi-Dirac semimetals, we find that
TiO$_{2}$/VO$_{2}$ nanostructure provides a promising candidate for the
realization of excitonic insulator. We also apply the renormalziation group

matrix as the product of two nonnegative matrices, is a key issue in machine
learning and data analysis. One approach to NMF is to formulate the problem as
a nonconvex optimization problem of minimizing the distance between a data
matrix and the product of two nonnegative matrices with nonnegativity
constraints and then solve the problem using an iterative algorithm. The
algorithms commonly used are the multiplicative update algorithm and the
alternating least-squares algorithm. Although both algorithms converge quickly,
they may not converge to a stationary point to the problem that is equal to the
solution to a nonmonotone variational inequality for the gradient of the
distance function. This paper presents an iterative algorithm for solving the
problem that is based on the Krasnosel'ski\u\i-Mann fixed point algorithm.
Convergence analysis showed that, under certain assumptions, any accumulation
point of the sequence generated by the proposed algorithm belongs to the
solution set of the variational inequality. Application of the {\tt 'mult'} and
{\tt'als'} algorithms in MATLAB and the proposed algorithm to various NMF
problems showed that the proposed algorithm had fast convergence and was

topological data of a finite graph, embedded into the UV curve $C$ of the
theory. The graph arises from a degenerate limit of spectral networks,
constructed at maximal intersections of walls of marginal stability in the
Coulomb branch of the gauge theory. The topology of the graph, together with a
notion of framing, encode equations that determine the monodromy. We develop an
algorithmic technique for solving the equations, and compute the monodromy in
several examples. The graph manifestly encodes the symmetries of the monodromy,
providing some support for conjectural relations to specializations of the
superconformal index. For $A_1$-type theories, the graphs encoding the
monodromy are ""dessins d'enfants"" on $C$, the corresponding Strebel

sheet production are the amides known as erucamide and behenamide, which
despite being almost identical chemically, lead to markedly different values of
the friction coefficient. To understand the origin of this contrasting
behavior, in this work we model brushes made of these two types of linear chain
molecules using quantum mechanical numerical simulations under the Density
Functional Theory at the B97D/6-31G(d,p)level of theory. Four chains of
erucamide and behenamide were linked to a 2X10 zigzag graphene sheet and
optimized both in vacuum and in continuous solvent using the SMD implicit
solvation model. We find that erucamide chains tend to remain closer together
through {\pi}{\pi} stacking interactions arising from the double bonds located
at C13 C14, a feature behenamide lacks and thus a more spread configuration is
obtained with the latter. It is argued that this arrangement of the erucamide
chains is responsible for the lower friction coefficient of erucamide brushes,
compared with behenamide brushes, which is a macroscopic consequence of
cooperative quantum mechanical interactions. While only quantum level
interactions are modeled here, we show that behenamide chains are more spread
out in the brush than erucamide chains as a consequence of those interactions.
The spread out configuration allows more solvent particles to penetrate the
brush, leading in turn to more friction, in agreement with macroscopic
measurements and mesoscale simulations of the friction coefficient reported in
the literature.

treated as one of 2 extreme cases: Particle-Cluster Aggregation and
Cluster-Cluster Aggregation. In this paper we study the process of hierarchical
growth, where aggregates are built from significantly smaller aggregates (but
not monomers). We show that this process can be understood as a modified,
PCA-like process that produces porous, but non-fractal particles whose filling
factor is chiefly determined by the porosity of the building blocks.
  We also show that in a coagulation environment where relative velocities are
driven by turbulence, a logarithmically flat mass distribution (equal mass per
mass decade) as it is typically found in environments where fragmentation
replenishes small grains, leads to a situation where small particles and
aggregates dominate the growth of large ones. Therefore, in such environments,
hierarchical growth should be seen as the norm. Consequently, we predict that
the aggregates in such environments are not fractals with extremely low
densities as they would result from extrapolation fractal laws to large sizes.
The compactification of aggregates does not only result from collisions with
enough energy to restructure aggregates - it starts already earlier by filling
voids in particles with smaller grains that contribute to the growth.

modulation scheme which is getting increased research attention recently, for
the uplink of a massive MIMO system. Each user is equipped with one transmit
antenna with multiple radio frequency (RF) mirrors (parasitic elements) placed
near it. The base station (BS) is equipped with tens to hundreds of receive
antennas. MBM with $m_{rf}$ RF mirrors and $n_r$ receive antennas over a
multipath channel has been shown to asymptotically (as $m_{rf}\rightarrow
\infty$) achieve the capacity of $n_r$ parallel AWGN channels. This suggests
that MBM can be attractive for use in massive MIMO systems which typically
employ a large number of receive antennas at the BS. In this paper, we
investigate the potential performance advantage of multiuser MBM (MU-MBM) in a
massive MIMO setting. Our results show that multiuser MBM (MU-MBM) can
significantly outperform other modulation schemes. For example, a bit error
performance achieved using 500 receive antennas at the BS in a massive MIMO
system using conventional modulation can be achieved using just 128 antennas
using MU-MBM. Even multiuser spatial modulation, and generalized spatial
modulation in the same massive MIMO settings require more than 200 antennas to
achieve the same bit error performance. Also, recognizing that the MU-MBM
signal vectors are inherently sparse, we propose an efficient MU-MBM signal
detection scheme that uses compressive sensing based reconstruction algorithms

interaction network with links determined by a Bernoulli process. In the limit
of a small introduction rate of new species, the model exhibits a discontinuous
transition from a high-diversity state to a low-diversity state as the
interaction probability between species, $\gamma$, is increased from zero. Here
we explore the effects of finite introduction rates and system-size on the
phase transition by utilizing efficient parallel computing. We find that the
low state appears for $\gamma>\gamma_c$. As $\gamma$ is increased further, the
high state approaches to the low state, suggesting the possibility that the two
states merge at a high $\gamma$. We find that the fraction of time spent in the
high state becomes longer with higher introduction rates, but the availability
of the two states is rather insensitive to the value of the introduction rate.
Furthermore we establish a relation between the introduction rate and the
system size, which preserves the probability for the system to remain in the
high-diversity state.

into groups of opposing views. When such issues emerge on social media, we
often observe the creation of 'echo chambers', i.e., situations where
like-minded people reinforce each other's opinion, but do not get exposed to
the views of the opposing side. In this paper we study algorithmic techniques
for bridging these chambers, and thus, reducing controversy. Specifically, we
represent the discussion on a controversial issue with an endorsement graph,
and cast our problem as an edge-recommendation problem on this graph. The goal
of the recommendation is to reduce the controversy score of the graph, which is
measured by a recently-developed metric based on random walks. At the same
time, we take into account the acceptance probability of the recommended edge,
which represents how likely the edge is to materialize in the endorsement
graph. We propose a simple model based on a recently-developed user-level
controversy score, that is competitive with state-of- the-art link-prediction
algorithms. We thus aim at finding the edges that produce the largest reduction
in the controversy score, in expectation. To solve this problem, we propose an
efficient algorithm, which considers only a fraction of all the combinations of
possible edges. Experimental results show that our algorithm is more efficient
than a simple greedy heuristic, while producing comparable score reduction.
Finally, a comparison with other state-of-the-art edge-addition algorithms
shows that this problem is fundamentally different from what has been studied
in the literature.

space may be influenced strongly by the fixed points of the fast subsystem.
Orbits then typically follow these points, performing in addition rapid
transitions between distinct branches on the time scale of the fast variables.
As the branches guide the dynamics of a system along the manifold of former
fixed points, they are considered transiently attracting states and the
intermittent transitions between branchescorrespond to state switching within
transient-state dynamics. A full characterization of the set of former fixed
points, the critical manifold, tends to be difficult in high-dimensional
dynamical systems such as large neural networks. Here we point out that an
easily computable subset of the critical manifold, the set of target points,
can be used as a reference for the investigation of high-dimensional slow-fast
systems. The set of target points corresponds in this context to the adiabatic
projection of a given orbit to the critical manifold. Applying our framework to
a simple recurrent neural network, we find that the scaling relation of the
Euclidean distance between the trajectory and its target points with the
control parameter of the slow time scale allows to distinguish an adiabatic
regime from a state that is effectively independent from target points.

bottleneck, we develop a dual-learning mechanism, which can enable an NMT
system to automatically learn from unlabeled data through a dual-learning game.
This mechanism is inspired by the following observation: any machine
translation task has a dual task, e.g., English-to-French translation (primal)
versus French-to-English translation (dual); the primal and dual tasks can form
a closed loop, and generate informative feedback signals to train the
translation models, even if without the involvement of a human labeler. In the
dual-learning mechanism, we use one agent to represent the model for the primal
task and the other agent to represent the model for the dual task, then ask
them to teach each other through a reinforcement learning process. Based on the
feedback signals generated during this process (e.g., the language-model
likelihood of the output of a model, and the reconstruction error of the
original sentence after the primal and dual translations), we can iteratively
update the two models until convergence (e.g., using the policy gradient
methods). We call the corresponding approach to neural machine translation
\emph{dual-NMT}. Experiments show that dual-NMT works very well on
English$\leftrightarrow$French translation; especially, by learning from
monolingual data (with 10% bilingual data for warm start), it achieves a
comparable accuracy to NMT trained from the full bilingual data for the

Euler equations in a domain with boundary. We work in the domain
$\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}_+$, where the boundary is both flat and has
finite measure.
  However, first we study the equations on domains without boundary (the whole
space $\mathbb{R}^3$, the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$, and the hybrid space
$\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}$). We make use of some of the arguments of Duchon
\& Robert ({\it Nonlinearity} {\bf 13} (2000) 249--255) to prove energy
conservation under the assumption that $u\in L^3(0,T;L^3(\mathbb{R}^3))$ and
one of the two integral conditions \begin{equation*} \lim_{|y|\to
0}\frac{1}{|y|}\int^T_0\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} |u(x+y)-u(x)|^3\,d x\,d t=0
\end{equation*} or \begin{equation*}
  \int_0^T\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^3}{|x-y|^{4+\delta}}\,d
x\,d y<\infty,\qquad\delta>0, \end{equation*} the second of which is equivalent
to requiring $u\in L^3(0,T;W^{\alpha,3}(\mathbb{R}^3))$ for some $\alpha>1/3$.
  We then use the first of these two conditions to prove energy conservation
for a weak solution $u$ on $D_+:=\mathbb{T}^2\times \mathbb{R}_+$: we extend
$u$ a solution defined on the whole of $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}$ and then
use the condition on this domain to prove energy conservation for a weak
solution $u\in L^3(0,T;L^3(D_+))$ that satisfies \begin{equation*} \lim_{|y|\to
0}
\frac{1}{|y|}\int^{T}_{0}\iint_{\mathbb{T}^2}\int^\infty_{|y|}|u(t,x+y)-u(t,x)|^3
\,d x_3 \,d x_1 \,d x_2 \,d t=0, \end{equation*} and certain continuity
conditions near the boundary $\partial D_+=\{x_3=0\}$.

task, as it has applications in, e.g., fraud detection and quality control.
State-of-the-art density-based algorithms perform well because they 1) take the
local neighbourhoods of data points into account and 2) consider feature
subspaces. In highly complex and high-dimensional data, however, existing
methods are likely to overlook important outliers because they do not
explicitly take into account that the data is often a mixture distribution of
multiple components.
  We therefore introduce GLOSS, an algorithm that performs local subspace
outlier detection using global neighbourhoods. Experiments on synthetic data
demonstrate that GLOSS more accurately detects local outliers in mixed data
than its competitors. Moreover, experiments on real-world data show that our
approach identifies relevant outliers overlooked by existing methods,
confirming that one should keep an eye on the global perspective even when
doing local outlier detection.

theory is the overlap Dirac operator at finite quark chemical potential.
Derivatives of the lattice Dirac operator are necessary for the computation of
conserved lattice currents or the fermionic force in Hybrid Monte-Carlo and
Langevin simulations. To calculate the overlap Dirac operator at finite
chemical potential the product of the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix
with a vector has to be computed. For non-Hermitian matrices it is not possible
to efficiently approximate the sign function with polynomials or rational
functions. Implicit approximation algorithms, like Krylov-Ritz methods, that
depend on the source vector have to be used instead. Our method can also
provide derivatives of such implicit approximations. We show how a generalised
deflation prescription can be used to improve the performance of the method, if
some eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix being differentiated are known.
To show that the method is efficient and well suited for practical calculations
we provide test results for the two-sided Lanczos approximation of the
finite-density overlap Dirac operator on SU(3) gauge field configurations on

vector is that it ignores word orders that carry syntactic and semantic
relationships among the words in a document, and they can be important in some
NLP tasks such as genre classification. This paper proposes a novel distributed
vector representation of a document: a simple recurrent-neural-network language
model (RNN-LM) or a long short-term memory RNN language model (LSTM-LM) is
first created from all documents in a task; some of the LM parameters are then
adapted by each document, and the adapted parameters are vectorized to
represent the document. The new document vectors are labeled as DV-RNN and
DV-LSTM respectively. We believe that our new document vectors can capture some
high-level sequential information in the documents, which other current
document representations fail to capture. The new document vectors were
evaluated in the genre classification of documents in three corpora: the Brown
Corpus, the BNC Baby Corpus and an artificially created Penn Treebank dataset.
Their classification performances are compared with the performance of TF-IDF
vector and the state-of-the-art distributed memory model of paragraph vector

three considered methods exploit different properties of the scattering matrix
$S(\mathscr{E};E)$ as a function of energy $E$: its poles, real values, and
zeros of the second derivative of its phase. The essential feature of the
method of zeroing the resolvent, which produces complex energies, is the
unlimited growth of the wave function at infinity, which is, however,
eliminated by the time-dependent interpretation. The real energies at which the
unitary scattering matrix becomes real correspond to the largest possible
distortion, $S=+1$, or its absence at $S=-1$ which in either case leads to the
formation of quasibound states. Depending on their response to increasing
electric intensity, two types of field-induced positive energy quasibound
levels are identified: electron- and hole-like states. Their evolution and
interaction in enlarging field lead ultimately to the coalescence of pairs of
opposite states, with concomitant divergence of the associated dipole moments
in what is construed as an electric breakdown of the structure. The
characteristic features of the coalescence fields and energies are calculated
and the behavior of the levels in their vicinity is analyzed. Similarities
between the different approaches and their peculiarities are highlighted; in

Solomon [FOCS 2016] gave a randomized dynamic algorithm for this problem that
has an approximation ratio of $2$ and an amortised update time of $O(1)$ with
high probability. This algorithm requires the assumption of an {\em oblivious
adversary}, meaning that the future sequence of edge insertions/deletions in
the graph cannot depend in any way on the algorithm's past output. A natural
way to remove the assumption on oblivious adversary is to give a deterministic

interactions between counter-propagating incompressible Alfv\'en wave parquets.
These features are thought to be ubiquitous in space plasmas. The present study
gives a new and more complex picture of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence
as observed in the terrestrial magnetosheath. The study uses three years of
in-situ data from the Cluster mission to explore the nature of the magnetic
fluctuations at MHD scales in different locations within the magnetosheath,
including flanks and subsolar regions. It is found that the magnetic field
fluctuations at MHD scales generally have a PSD close to f^-1 (shallower than
the Kolmogorov one f^-5/3) down to the ion characteristic scale, which recalls
the energy containing scales of solar wind turbulence. The Kolmogorov spectrum
is observed only away from the bow shock toward the flank and the magnetopause
regions in 17% of the analyzed time intervals. Measuring the magnetic
compressibility, it is shown that only a fraction (35%) of the observed
Kolmogorov spectra were populated by shear Alfv\'enic fluctuations, whereas the
majority of the events (65%) was found to be dominated by compressible
magnetosonic-like fluctuations, which contrasts with well-known turbulence
properties in the solar wind. This study gives a first comprehensive view of
the origin of the f^-1 and the transition to the Kolmogorov inertial range;
both questions remain controversial in solar wind turbulence.

general relativity; this allows the possibility of non-Killing horizons in
stationary solutions. In the case of non-Killing horizons different definitions
of surface gravity are truly different quantities. This also has application to
modified theories of gravity, where there is no reason to expect all horizons
to be Killing horizons. In Lorentz violating theories, the situation becomes
even stranger, as Killing horizons are at best low energy barriers, but for
superluminal dispersion relations a true causal barrier, the universal horizon,
may be present. We investigate the nature of these universal horizons via a ray
tracing study, and delve into what happens near both the universal and Killing
horizons. From this study we determine the surface gravity of universal
horizons by the peeling properties of rays near the horizon and discuss
whether, and at what temperature these horizons radiate. Finally, we combine
our investigations of universal horizons and analogue spacetimes, and ask why
we have not seen a universal horizon in studies of analogue gravity.

I, the CP determines the edge caching policy (for a relatively long time
period). In Stage II, the CP decides the real-time data sponsoring strategy for
each content request within the period. We first propose a Lyapunov-based
online sponsoring strategy in Stage II, which reaches 90% of the offline
maximum performance (benchmark). We then solve the edge caching problem in
Stage I based on the online sponsoring strategy proposed in Stage II, and show
that the optimal caching policy depends on the aggregate user request for each

increase the CP's revenue by 30%~100%, comparing with the purely data

novel model and find that insufficient resource leads to an abrupt increase in
the infected population size, which is in marked contrast with the continuous
phase transitions believed previously. Counterintuitively, this abrupt phase
transition is more pronounced in the less contagious diseases, which usually
correspond to the most fatal ones. Furthermore, we find that even for a single
infection source, public resource needs to meet a significant amount, which is
proportional to the whole population size to ensure epidemic containment. Our
findings provide a theoretical foundation for efficient epidemic containment
strategies in the early stage.

The breakup of the projectile is simulated by a finite number of square

the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, and requires the scattering wave functions. We
present two different methods to separate both effects. Then, we apply this
separation to breakup and reaction cross sections of 7Li + 208Pb. For breakup,
we investigate various aspects, such as the role of the alpha + t continuum,
the angular-momentum distribution, and the balance between Coulomb and nuclear
effects. We show that there is a large ambiguity in defining the 'Coulomb' and
'nuclear' breakup cross sections, since both techniques, although providing the
same total breakup cross sections, strongly differ for the individual
components. We suggest a third method which could be efficiently used to
address convergence problems at large angular momentum. For reaction cross
sections, interference effects are smaller, and the nuclear contribution is
dominant above the Coulomb barrier. We also draw attention on different
definitions of the reaction cross section which exist in the literature, and
which may induce small, but significant, differences in the numerical values.

results concerning scattered $C^*$-algebras, in a manner parallel to the
commutative case of scattered compact or locally compact Hausdorff spaces and
superatomic Boolean algebras. It also allows us to formulate problems which
have motivated the ""cardinal sequences"" programme in the classical topology, in
the noncommutative context.
  This leads to some new constructions of noncommutative scattered
$C^*$-algebras and new open problems. In particular, we construct a type $I$
$C^*$-algebra which is the inductive limit of stable ideals $\mathcal
A_\alpha$, along an uncountable limit ordinal $\lambda$, such that $\mathcal
A_{\alpha+1}/\mathcal A_\alpha$ is $*$-isomorphic to the algebra of all compact
operators on a separable Hilbert space and $\mathcal A_{\alpha+1}$ is
$\sigma$-unital and stable for each $\alpha<\lambda$, but $\mathcal A$ is not
stable and where all ideals of $\mathcal A$ are of the form $\mathcal
A_\alpha$. In particular, $\mathcal A$ is a nonseparable $C^*$-algebra with no
ideal which is maximal among the stable ideals.
  This answers a question of M. R\ordam in the nonseparable case. All the above
$C^*$-algebras $A_\alpha$s and $A$ satisfy the following version of the
definition of an AF algebra: any finite subset can be approximated from a
finite-dimensional subalgebra. Two more complex constructions based on the
language developed in this paper are presented in separate papers.

form, at least partly, via mergers. If this was a predominant formation channel
for the Milky Way's halo, imprints of this merger history in the form of moving
groups or streams should exist also in the vicinity of the Sun. Here we study
the kinematics of halo stars in the Solar neighbourhood using the very recent
first data release from the Gaia mission, and in particular the TGAS dataset,
in combination with data from the RAVE survey. Our aim is to determine the
amount of substructure present in the phase-space distribution of halo stars
that could be linked to merger debris. To characterise kinematic substructure,
we measure the velocity correlation function in our sample of halo (low
metallicity) stars. We also study the distribution of these stars in the space
of energy and two components of the angular momentum, in what we call
""Integrals of Motion"" space. The velocity correlation function reveals
substructure in the form of an excess of pairs of stars with similar
velocities, well above that expected for a smooth distribution. Comparison to
cosmological simulations of the formation of stellar halos indicate that the
levels found are consistent with the Galactic halo having been built fully via
accretion. Similarly, the distribution of stars in the space of ""Integrals of
motion"" is highly complex. A strikingly high fraction (between 58% and upto
73%) of the stars that are somewhat less bound than the Sun are on (highly)
retrograde orbits. A simple comparison to Milky Way-mass galaxies in
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations suggests that less than 1% have such
prominently retrograde outer halos. We also identify several other
statistically significant structures in ""Integrals of Motion"" space that could
potentially be related to merger events.

measurement processes: the measurement outputs are truly random given the input
state is a superposition of the eigenstates of the measurement operators. In
the case of \emph{trusted} devices, true randomness could be generated from a
mixed state $\rho$ so long as the system entangled with $\rho$ is well
protected. We propose a random number generation scheme based on measuring the
quadrature fluctuations of a single mode thermal state using an optical
homodyne detector. By mixing the output of a broadband amplified spontaneous
emission (ASE) source with a single mode local oscillator (LO) at a beam
splitter and performing differential photo-detection, we can selectively detect
the quadrature fluctuation of a single mode output of the ASE source, thanks to
the filtering function of the LO. Experimentally, a quadrature variance about
three orders of magnitude larger than the vacuum noise has been observed,
suggesting this scheme can tolerate much higher detector noise in comparison
with QRNGs based on measuring the vacuum noise. The high quality of this
entropy source is evidenced by the small correlation coefficients of the
acquired data. A Toeplitz hashing extractor is applied to generate unbiased
random bits from the Gaussian distributed raw data, achieving an efficiency of
5.12 bits per sample. The output of the Toeplitz extractor successfully passes
all the NIST statistical tests for random numbers.

plasmas produced in collisions at the RHIC facility (including in the beam
energy scans), it is known how to deal with this problem: one has to take into
account the large angular momenta generated in these plasmas, and the effects
of the baryonic chemical potential. But this does not work for the plasmas
produced in peripheral collisions at the LHC. However, these results neglect
some (less significant) aspects of bulk physics; could it be that the problem
is resolved by taking into account these lower-order effects? Here we use a
bulk dilatonic field (fully compatible with boundary data, as well as with the
asymptotically AdS character of the bulk geometry) as a model of these effects,
and show that this is unlikely to be the solution. Thus, the existence of a
consistent holographic description of the most extreme LHC plasmas remains open

misoriented from the parent grain by a rotation of 56 deg around the a-axis.
The classical theory of deformation twinning does not precise the atomic
displacements and does not explain why contractions twinning is less frequent
than extension twinning. The paper proposes a new model in the continuity of
our previous works on martensitic transformations and extension twinning. A
continuous angular distortion matrix that transforms the initial hcp crystal
into a final hcp crystal is determined such that the atoms move as hard spheres
and reach the final positions expected by the orientation relationship. The
calculations prove that the distortion is not a simple shear when it is
considered in its continuity. The (01-11) twin plane is untilted and restored,
but it is not fully invariant because some interatomic distances in this plane
evolve during the distortion process; the unit volume also increases up to 5%
before coming back to its initial value when the twinning distortion is
complete. Then, the distortion takes the form a simple shear on the twin plane
with a shear direction along the direction [18,-5,-5] and a shear amplitude of
0.358. It is the first time that this twinning mode is reported. Experiments
are proposed to validate or infirm the new model.

which in turn triggers the generation of a new (simulated) motor command by an
inverse model. Thus, a series of mental images in the sensory and in the motor

  Southampton, UK",,,,"hep-lat","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate a class of four-fermion theories which includes well-known
models like the Gross-Neveu model and the Thirring model. In three spacetime
dimensions, they are used to model interesting solid state systems like high
temperature superconductors and graphene. Additionally, they serve as toy
models to study chiral symmetry breaking (CSB).
  For any number of fermion flavours the Gross-Neveu model has a broken and a
symmetric phase, while the existence of a broken phase in the Thirring model
depends on the number of flavours. The critical number of fermion flavours
beyond which there exists no CSB is still subject of ongoing discussions. Using
SLAC fermions we simulate the Thirring model with exact chiral symmetry. To
obtain a chiral condensate one can introduce a symmetry-breaking mass term and
carefully study the limits of infinite lattice and zero-mass. So far, we did
not see CSB within this approach for the Thirring model with 2 or more
(reducible) flavours.
  The talk presents alternative approaches to investigate these findings. We
employ certain Fierz identities to map the Thirring model into equivalent
four-fermion models, for which the chiral condensate does not seem to vanish.
In the new formulations based on reshuffled degrees of freedom we find a sign
problem (which is not present in the original formulation). For this reason we
developed an algorithm similar to fermion bags, which may solve this problem.
As a further approach, we embed the multi-flavour Thirring model in a larger
class of four-fermion theories to study the chiral symmetry and its breaking in
a wider context.

spheroidal particle immersed in an electrolyte solution. Because the charged
spheroid attracts counter-ions which form the electric double layer around the
particle, using usual boundary conditions at the interface between the particle
and electrolyte can be quite complicated and challenging. Hence, we generalize
Fixman's boundary conditions, originally derived for spherical particles, to
the case of the charged oblate spheroid. Given two different counter-ion
distributions in the thin electric double layer limit, we obtain analytic
expressions for the polarization coefficients to the first non-trivial order in
frequency. We find that the polarization response normal to the symmetry axis
depends on the total amount of charge carried by the oblate spheroid while that
parallel to the symmetry axis is suppressed when there is less charge on the
edge of the spheroid. We further study the overall dielectric response for a
dilute suspension of charged spheroids. We find that the dielectric enhancement
at low frequency, which is driven by the presence of a large $\zeta$-potential
(surface charge), is suppressed by high ion concentrations in the electrolyte
and depends on the size of the suspended particles. In addition, spheroids with
higher aspect ratios will also lead to a stronger dielectric enhancement due to
the combination of the electric double layer and textural effects. The
characteristic frequency associated with the dielectric enhancement scales
inversely with the square of the particle size, the major radius of the
spheroid, and it has a weak dependence on the shape of spheroids.

The corresponding fractional-combinatorial and non-convex EE problem, involving

tackle this, we separate the eigen-channel assignment and power allocation

tackle the EE maximization problem under fixed receive antenna set using
Dinkelbach-based convex programming, iterative joint eigen-channel assignment

(MOO)-based approach. On the other hand, the number of active receive antennas
induces a trade-off in the achievable sum-rate and power transfer versus the
transmit-independent power consumption. We provide a fundamental study of the
achievable EE with antenna selection and accordingly develop dynamic optimal
exhaustive search and Frobenius-norm-based schemes. Simulation results confirm
the theoretical findings and demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation

of this main question leads us to the class of manifolds with boundary and
bounded geometry introduced by Schick (Math. Nach. 2001). We begin with some
needed results on the geometry of manifolds with boundary and bounded geometry.
Let $\partial_D M \subset \partial M$ be an open and closed subset of the
boundary of $M$. We say that $(M, \partial_D M)$ has \emph{finite width} if, by
definition, $M$ is a manifold with boundary and bounded geometry such that the
distance $d(x, \partial_D M)$ from a point $x \in M$ to $\partial_D M \subset
\partial M$ is bounded uniformly in $x$ (and hence, in particular, $\partial_D
M$ intersects all connected components of $M$). For manifolds $(M, \partial_D
M)$ with finite width, we prove a Poincar\'e inequality for functions vanishing
on $\partial_D M$, thus generalizing an important result of Sakurai (Osaka J.
Math, 2017). The Poincar\'e inequality then leads, as in the classical case to
results on the spectrum of $\Delta$ with domain given by mixed boundary
conditions, in particular, $\Delta$ is invertible for manifolds $(M, \partial_D
M)$ with finite width. The bounded geometry assumption then allows us to prove
the well-posedness of the Poisson problem with mixed boundary conditions in
higher Sobolev spaces $H^s(M)$, $s \ge 0$.

focus on the identification of essential energetic components, the optimal
parametrization of energies, and the efficient computational implementation of
energy variation or minimization. Given the fact that complex biomolecular
systems are structurally non-uniform and their interactions occur through
contact interfaces, their free energies are associated with various interfaces
as well, such as solute-solvent interface, molecular binding interface, lipid
domain interface, and membrane surfaces. This fact motivates the inclusion of
interface geometry, particular its curvatures, to the parametrization of free
energies. Applications of such interface geometry based energetic variational
principles are illustrated through three concrete topics: the multiscale
modeling of biomolecular electrostatics and solvation that includes the
curvature energy of the molecular surface, the formation of microdomains on
lipid membrane due to the geometric and molecular mechanics at the lipid
interface, and the mean curvature driven protein localization on membrane

terms of noise-assisted transport effect and dynamical localization which
correspond to two mechanisms underpinning the transfer process in

dynamical localization effect captured by the polaron master equation. The
effects of system-bath coupling and bath correlation are incorporated in the
effective system-bath coupling strength determining whether noise-assisted

temperature modulates the balance of the two mechanisms. Furthermore, these two

The two mechanisms is manifestations of dual role played by bath-induced

photoelectrons are the only elementary particles which create an electrical
current through sunlit surface of the moon. They are knocked off of the surface
soil, rise above the surface, and then fall back. Therefore, on average, on any
unit of surface area there is a positive charge, equal in magnitude to the
charge of photoelectrons flying over this area. However, the charge of any
small dust particle can strongly fluctuate discretely: a photoelectron can be
either knocked off of the or be reacquired by the particle. The result is a
""random walk"" in sign and magnitude of the charge of grains. In a few minutes
after sunrise, almost every dust particle on the surface has at least one extra
or missing electron, and the average modulus of the charge accumulated on a
particle is proportional to the square root of the number of ""steps"" (knocking
off /returns of photoelectrons). Therefore, the average value of the modulus of
the charge of a fine dust particle exceeds by several orders of magnitude the
proportion of the average surface charge attributable to the particle. So dust
particles that have ejected a sufficient number of photoelectrons can take off
from the surface because of the electric field of the near surface charge
double layer. It is shown that: (i) almost half of all dust particles on the
illuminated lunar surface are missing at least one electron; (ii) a significant
portion of particles up to 100 nm in size emits several photoelectrons and
acquire a positive charge, sufficient to take off from the surface; (iii) above
the surface there is a ""boiling layer"" of dust with a maximum thickness of

  diffusion on tripartite graphs",,,"10.1016/j.physa.2017.04.121",,"cs.IR cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recommender systems (RSs) have been a widely exploited approach to solving
the information overload problem. However, the performance is still limited due
to the extreme sparsity of the rating data. With the popularity of Web 2.0, the
social tagging system provides more external information to improve
recommendation accuracy. Although some existing approaches combine the matrix
factorization models with co-occurrence properties and context of tags, they
neglect the issue of tag sparsity without the commonly associated tags problem
that would also result in inaccurate recommendations. Consequently, in this
paper, we propose a novel hybrid collaborative filtering model named
WUDiff_RMF, which improves Regularized Matrix Factorization (RMF) model by
integrating Weighted User-Diffusion-based CF algorithm(WUDiff) that obtains the
information of similar users from the weighted tripartite user-item-tag graph.
This model aims to capture the degree correlation of the user-item-tag
tripartite network to enhance the performance of recommendation. Experiments
conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly performs better than already widely used methods in the accuracy
of recommendation. Moreover, results show that WUDiff_RMF can alleviate the
data sparsity, especially in the circumstance that users have made few ratings
and few tags.

presenting an approach to two basic consequences of the presence of compact
extra-dimensions based on undergraduate-level physics. The insensibility of
low-energy physics to compact extra dimensions is illustrated in the context of
non-relativistic quantum mechanics and the prediction of Kaluza-Klein
excitations of particles is discussed in the framework of relativistic
wave-equations. An exercise that could be used as a follow-up to the ""particle

(MC) simulation that achieves variance reduction by simulating the governing
equations on a series of spatial (or temporal) grids with increasing
resolution. Instead of directly employing the fine grid solutions, MLMC
estimates the expectation of the quantity of interest from the coarsest grid
solutions as well as differences between each two consecutive grid solutions.
When the differences corresponding to finer grids become smaller, hence less
variable, fewer MC realizations of finer grid solutions are needed to compute
the difference expectations, thus leading to a reduction in the overall work.
This paper presents an extension of MLMC, referred to as multilevel control
variates (MLCV), where a low-rank approximation to the solution on each grid,
obtained primarily based on coarser grid solutions, is used as a control
variate for estimating the expectations involved in MLMC. Cost estimates as
well as numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the advantage of this
new MLCV approach over the standard MLMC when the solution of interest admits a
low-rank approximation and the cost of simulating finer grids grows fast.

of compressible two-phase flow, that accounts for phase transition and surface
tension effects. To fix the mass exchange and entropy dissipation rate across
the interface kinetic relations are frequently used. The complete
uni-directional dynamics can then be understood by solving generalized
two-phase Riemann problems. We present new well-posedness theorems for the
Riemann problem and corresponding computable Riemann solvers, that cover quite
general equations of state, metastable input data and curvature effects. The
new Riemann solver is used to validate different kinetic relations on
physically relevant problems including a comparison with experimental data.
Riemann solvers are building blocks for many numerical schemes that are used to
track interfaces in two-phase flow. It is shown that the new Riemann solver
enables reliable and efficient computations for physical situations that could
not be treated before.

neutrinos ($N_\nu=3$), and a {\sl purely baryonic} matter sector (no cold
dark-matter (CDM)). The according SU(2) temperature-redshift relation of the
CMB is contrasted with recent measurements appealing to the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and CMB-photon absorption by molecular rotations
bands or atomic hyperfine levels. Relying on a realistic simulation of the
ionization history throughout recombination, we obtain $z_*=1693.55\pm 6.98$

visibility functions in the solutions to the associated Boltzmann hierarchy and
Euler equation we conclude that $z_*$ and $z_{\rm drag}$ over-estimate the
redshifts for the respective photon and baryon-velocity freeze-out. Realistic
decoupling values turn out to be $z_{{\rm lf},*}=1554.89\pm 5.18$ and $z_{\rm

are nevertheless unchanged. We find further, that if we assume the absence of
magnetic monopoles, in accordance with Maxwell's theory, our generalized
transformations are then restricted to be the conventional ones. While the
conventional Lorentz transformations are indeed recovered from our framework,
we nevertheless provide a new perspective into why the Lorentz transformations
are constrained to be the conventional ones. Also, this generalized framework
may assist in explaining several unresolved questions in electromagnetism as
well as to be able to describe quasi magnetic monopoles found in spin-ice
systems.

Argument is based on the premise that we are more likely to exist in a universe
containing a greater number of observers. Here we present a Bayesian
reformulation of the Doomsday Argument which is immune to this effect. By
marginalising over the spatial configuration of observers, we find that any
preference for a larger total number of observers has no impact on the inferred
local number. Our results remain unchanged when we adopt either the
Self-Indexing Assumption (SIA) or the Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA).
Furthermore the median value of our posterior distribution is found to be in
agreement with the frequentist forecast. Humanity's prognosis for the coming
