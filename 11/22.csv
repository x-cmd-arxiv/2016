representatives (e.g., a parliament) for a group of voters. In this model,
called the voting committee model, the elected group of representatives runs a
number of ballots to make final decisions regarding various issues. The
satisfaction of voters comes from the final decisions made by the elected
committee. Our results suggest that depending on a decision system used by the
committee to make these final decisions, different multi-winner election rules
are most suitable for electing the committee. Furthermore, we show that if we
allow not only a committee, but also an election rule used to make final
decisions, to depend on the voters' preferences, we can obtain an even better
representation of the voters.

guide the search for nodal semimetals which are `filling-enforced'. We recast
the previously-derived constraints on the allowed electron fillings for band
insulators in the 230 space groups into a new form, which enables effective
screening of materials candidates based solely on their (1) space group, (2)
electron count in the formula unit, and (3) multiplicity of the formula unit.
This criterion greatly reduces the computation load for discovering topological
materials in a database of previously-synthesized compounds. Of the more than
30,000 entires listed in a few selected nonsymmorphic space groups, our filling
criterion alone eliminates 96% of the entries before they are passed on for
further analysis. From this guided search, we discover a handful of candidates,
including the monoclinic crystals Ca$_2$Pt$_2$Ga, AgF$_2$, and Ca$_2$InOsO$_6$,
and the orthorhombic crystal CsHg$_2$. Based on ab initio calculations, we show
that these materials have filling-enforced Dirac nodes near the Fermi energy.

competition: one for which the two expectations are equal and one for which
they are different. The choice between the two models is performed through a
Bayesian analysis, based on a robust choice of combined objective and
subjective priors, set on the parameters space and on the models space. Three
steps are necessary to evaluate the posterior probability of each model using
two historical datasets similar to the one of interest. Starting from the
Jeffreys prior, a posterior using a first historical dataset is deduced and
allows to calibrate the Normal-Gamma informative priors for the second
historical dataset analysis, in addition to a uniform prior on the model space.
From this second step, a new posterior on the parameter space and the models
space can be used as the objective informative prior for the last Bayesian
analysis. Bayesian and frequentist methods have been compared on simulated and
real data. In accordance with FDA recommendations, control of type I and type
II error rates has been evaluated. The proposed method controls them even if
the historical experiments are not completely similar to the one of interest.

backbone of the proposed method is the Incremental Mixture Importance Sampling
(IMIS) algorithm of Raftery and Bao (2010), which builds a mixture importance
distribution incrementally, by positioning new mixture components where the
importance density lacks mass, relative to the target. The key innovation
proposed here is that the mixture components used by IMIS are local
approximations to the target density. In particular, their mean vectors and
covariance matrices are constructed by numerically solving certain differential
equations, whose solution depends on the gradient field of the target
log-density. The new sampler has a number of advantages: a) it provides an
extremely parsimonious parametrization of the mixture importance density, whose
configuration effectively depends only on the shape of the target and on a
single free parameter representing pseudo-time; b) it scales well with the
dimensionality of the target; c) it can deal with targets that are not log-
concave. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a
synthetic non-Gaussian multimodal density, defined on up to eighty dimensions,
and on a Bayesian logistic regression model, using the Sonar data-set. The
Julia code implementing the importance sampler proposed here can be found at

approach is therefore needed to support statistical inference on the bottom-up
local connectivity mechanisms influencing the formation of the estimated brain

(ERGM) to reproduce brain networks, or connectomes, estimated by spectral
coherence between high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. We
validated this approach in a dataset of 108 healthy subjects during eyes-open
(EO) and eyes-closed (EC) resting-state conditions. Results showed that the
tendency to form triangles and stars, reflecting clustering and node
centrality, better explained the global properties of the EEG connectomes as
compared to other combinations of graph metrics. Synthetic networks generated
by this model configuration replicated the characteristic differences found in
brain networks, with EO eliciting significantly higher segregation in the alpha
frequency band (8-13 Hz) as compared to EC. Furthermore, the fitted ERGM
parameter values provided complementary information showing that clustering
connections are significantly more represented from EC to EO in the alpha
range, but also in the beta band (14-29 Hz), which is known to play a crucial
role in cortical processing of visual input and externally oriented attention.
These findings support the current view of the brain functional segregation and
integration in terms of modules and hubs, and provide a statistical approach to
extract new information on the (re)organizational mechanisms in healthy and

modes and turbulence. In this thesis, we explore a method to drive rotation in
large tokamaks: up-down asymmetry in the magnetic equilibrium. We seek to
maximise this rotation by finding optimal up-down asymmetric flux surface
shapes.
  First, we use the ideal MHD model to show that low order external shaping
(e.g. elongation) is best for creating up-down asymmetric flux surfaces
throughout the device. Then, we calculate realistic up-down asymmetric
equilibria for input into nonlinear gyrokinetic turbulence analysis. Analytic
gyrokinetics shows that, in the limit of fast shaping effects, a poloidal tilt
of the flux surface shaping has little effect on turbulent transport. Since
up-down symmetric surfaces do not transport momentum, this invariance to tilt
implies that devices with mirror symmetry about any line in the poloidal plane
will drive minimal rotation. Accordingly, further analytic investigation
suggests that non-mirror symmetric flux surfaces with envelopes created by the
beating of fast shaping effects may create significantly stronger momentum
transport.
  Guided by these analytic results, we carry out local nonlinear gyrokinetic
simulations of non-mirror symmetric flux surfaces created with the lowest
possible shaping effects. First, we consider tilted elliptical flux surfaces
with a Shafranov shift and find little increase in the momentum transport when
the effect of the pressure profile on the equilibrium is included. We then
simulate flux surfaces with independently-tilted elongation and triangularity.
These two-mode configurations show a $60\%$ increase over configurations with
just elongation or triangularity. A rough analytic estimate indicates that the
optimal two-mode configuration can drive rotation with an on-axis Alfven Mach
number of $1.5 \%$ in an ITER-like machine.

fundamental issues govern the resilience? Can advanced approaches such as

paper discusses the research to date and open issues related to these

approaches for quantifying resilience. In particular, a first aspect of this
problem is how to model large-scale failures, recoveries and impacts, involving
the infrastructure, service providers, customers, and weather. A second aspect
is how to identify generic vulnerability (i.e., non-resilience) in the
infrastructure and services through large-scale data analytics. And, a third is
to understand what resilience metrics are needed and how to develop them.

algorithms because the standard model of computation (the real RAM) does not
support it. For this reason, we first revisit our model of computation to have
a reasonable theoretical framework. Under this framework we show how the use of
a bit representation for the union of triangles, in combination with
rank-select data structures, allows us to implicitly compute the union of $n$
triangles with roughly $O(1)$ bits per union boundary vertex. This results in
an algorithm that uses at most as much space as the previous one, and depending
on the input, can give a reduction of up to a factor $\Theta(\log n)$, while
maintaining the running time.

the number of words that appear from two opposed lexicons, such as positive and
negative sentiment. Creating such words lists is often easier than labeling
instances, and they can be debugged by non-experts if classification
performance is unsatisfactory. However, there is little analysis or
justification of this classification heuristic. This paper describes a set of
assumptions that can be used to derive a probabilistic justification for
lexicon-based classification, as well as an analysis of its expected accuracy.
One key assumption behind lexicon-based classification is that all words in
each lexicon are equally predictive. This is rarely true in practice, which is
why lexicon-based approaches are usually outperformed by supervised classifiers
that learn distinct weights on each word from labeled instances. This paper
shows that it is possible to learn such weights without labeled data, by
leveraging co-occurrence statistics across the lexicons. This offers the best
of both worlds: light supervision in the form of lexicons, and data-driven
classification with higher accuracy than traditional word-counting heuristics.

edge weights in an activity-dependent manner. We show how two fundamental
plasticity rules (long-term potentiation and long-term depression) can be cast
as a distributed gradient descent algorithm for regulating traffic flow in
engineered networks. We then characterize, both via simulation and
analytically, how different forms of edge-weight update rules affect network
routing efficiency and robustness. We find a close correspondence between
certain classes of synaptic weight update rules derived experimentally in the
brain and rules commonly used in engineering, suggesting common principles to
both.

1p/19q in low-grade gliomas (LGG) with positive response to treatment and
longer progression free survival. Therefore, predicting 1p/19q status is
crucial for effective treatment planning of LGG. In this study, we predict the
1p/19q status from MR images using convolutional neural networks (CNN), which
could be a noninvasive alternative to surgical biopsy and histopathological
analysis. Method: Our method consists of three main steps: image registration,
tumor segmentation, and classification of 1p/19q status using CNN. We included
a total of 159 LGG with 3 image slices each who had biopsy-proven 1p/19q status
(57 nondeleted and 102 codeleted) and preoperative postcontrast-T1 (T1C) and T2
images. We divided our data into training, validation, and test sets. The
training data was balanced for equal class probability and then augmented with
iterations of random translational shift, rotation, and horizontal and vertical
flips to increase the size of the training set. We shuffled and augmented the
training data to counter overfitting in each epoch. Finally, we evaluated
several configurations of a multi-scale CNN architecture until training and
validation accuracies became consistent. Results: The results of the best
performing configuration on the unseen test set were 93.3% (sensitivity),
82.22% (specificity), and 87.7% (accuracy). Conclusion: Multi-scale CNN with
their self-learning capability provides promising results for predicting 1p/19q
status noninvasively based on T1C and T2 images. Significance: Predicting
1p/19q status noninvasively from MR images would allow selecting effective
treatment strategies for LGG patients without the need for surgical biopsy.

approximately preserves the quadratic form of $G$, i.e. for all vectors $x$,
$x^T L_G x \approx x^T L_H x$, where $L_G$ and $L_H$ denote the respective
graph Laplacians. Spectral sparsifiers generalize cut sparsifiers, and have
found many applications in designing graph algorithms. In recent years, there
has been interest in computing spectral sparsifiers in semi-streaming and
dynamic settings. Natural algorithms in these settings often involve repeated
sparsification of a graph, and accumulation of errors across these steps. We
present a framework for analyzing algorithms that perform repeated
sparsifications that only incur error corresponding to a single sparsification
step, leading to better results for many resparsification-based algorithms. As
an application, we show how to maintain a spectral sparsifier in the
semi-streaming setting: We present a simple algorithm that, for a graph $G$ on
$n$ vertices and $m$ edges, computes a spectral sparsifier of $G$ with $O(n
\log n)$ edges in a single pass over $G$, using only $O(n \log n)$ space, and
$O(m \log^2 n)$ total time. This improves on previous best semi-streaming
algorithms for both spectral and cut sparsifiers by a factor of $\log{n}$ in
both space and runtime. The algorithm extends to semi-streaming row sampling
for general PSD matrices. We also use our framework to combine a spectral
sparsification algorithm by Koutis with improved spanner constructions to give
a parallel algorithm for constructing $O(n\log^2{n}\log\log{n})$ sized spectral
sparsifiers in $O(m\log^2{n}\log\log{n})$ time. This is the best known
combinatorial graph sparsification algorithm.The size of the sparsifiers is
only a factor $\log{n}\log\log{n}$ more than ones produced by numerical
routines.

energies for the lattice subsystem and magnetic subsystem. On the basis of
minimization principle for the Gibbs energy, a set of equations of state for

  The formalism is extensively illustrated with the numerical calculations
performed for a system of ferromagnetically coupled spins $S$=1/2 localized at
the sites of simple cubic lattice. In particular, the significant influence of
the magnetic subsystem on the elastic properties is demonstrated. It manifests
itself in significant modification of such quantities as the relative volume
deformation, thermal expansion coefficient or isothermal compressibility, in
particular, in the vicinity of the magnetic phase transition. On the other
hand, the influence of lattice subsystem on the magnetic one is also evident.
It takes, for example, the form of dependence of the critical (Curie)

calculations of jet shapes and cross sections in proton-proton and lead-lead

substructure calculation is necessary for precise theoretical predictions. The
resummation is performed using renormalization group evolution between
characteristic jet scales. We also find that the medium induces power
corrections to jet shapes. In the end we present the comparison between our

Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX), called a branch shadowing attack, which
can reveal fine-grained control flows (i.e., each branch) of an enclave program
running on real SGX hardware. The root cause of this attack is that Intel SGX
does not clear the branch history when switching from enclave mode to
non-enclave mode, leaving the fine-grained traces to the outside world through
a branch-prediction side channel. However, exploiting the channel is not so
straightforward in practice because 1) measuring branch
prediction/misprediction penalties based on timing is too inaccurate to
distinguish fine-grained control-flow changes and 2) it requires sophisticated
control over the enclave execution to force its execution to the interesting
code blocks. To overcome these challenges, we developed two novel exploitation
techniques: 1) Intel PT- and LBR-based history-inferring techniques and 2)
APIC-based technique to control the execution of enclave programs in a
fine-grained manner. As a result, we could demonstrate our attack by breaking
recent security constructs, including ORAM schemes, Sanctum, SGX-Shield, and
T-SGX. Not limiting our work to the attack itself, we thoroughly studied the
feasibility of hardware-based solutions (e.g., branch history clearing) and
also proposed a software-based countermeasure, called Zigzagger, to mitigate
the branch shadowing attack in practice.

from the Kepler pixel data and used standard time-series analysis tools to
construct a set of significant frequencies for each target. These sets were
first filtered from combination frequencies, and then screened for period
spacing patterns. We detect gravity mode period series of modes of the same
degree l with consecutive radial order n in four new and one revisited SPB

orders) are influenced by rotation and carry signatures of chemical mixing
processes. Our spectroscopic analysis, in addition to placing each object

tasks specific to that application. Managing the VMs involves a sophisticated
trade-off between cloud-related demands, which are expressed by the provisional
costs of leased cloud resources, and exogenous cost demands expressed by
service revenues that are typically bound to SLAs. The internal costs may
include VM deployment/termination cost, and VM lease cost. The exogenous costs
refer to rewards accumulated due to the successfully accomplished tasks being
run by each application instance. In the case where the SLA restricts
performance to a certain load level at each VM, tasks incoming at VMs that
reached that level are rejected. Rejections cause fines deducted against the
rewards. The performance level is also quantified, namely, by means of a delay
cost, according to the average delay experienced by tasks. Typical examples for
specific applications which fall within this class of problems include handling
of scientific worklflows and network functioning virtualization (NFV). We model
this problem by cost-optimal load balancing to a queuing system with a flexible
number of queues, where a queue (VM) can be deployed, can have a task directed
to it and can be terminated. We analyze the system by Markov decision process
(MDP) and numerically solve it to find the optimal policy, which captures the
aforementioned costs and performance constraints. Within this constrained
framework, we also investigate the impact of average VM deployment time. We
show that the optimal policy possesses decision thresholds which depend on
several parameters. We validate policies found by MDP, through directing an
exogenous computational tasks flow to a set-up implemented on AWS.

the free energy as a function of the film thickness $h$ and also the closely
related structural disjoining pressure $\Pi = - \partial g / \partial h$. The
wetting behaviour of the liquid is encoded in the binding potential and the
equilibrium film thickness corresponds to the value at the minimum of $g(h)$.
Here, the method we developed in [J. Chem. Phys. 142, 074702 (2015)], and
applied with a simple discrete lattice-gas model, is used with continuum
density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the binding potential for a
Lennard-Jones fluid and other simple liquids. The DFT used is based on
fundamental measure theory and so incorporates the influence of the layered
packing of molecules at the surface and the corresponding oscillatory density
profile. The binding potential is frequently input in mesoscale models from
which liquid drop shapes and even dynamics can be calculated. Here we show that
the equilibrium droplet profiles calculated using the mesoscale theory are in
good agreement with the profiles calculated directly from the microscopic DFT.
For liquids composed of particles where the range of the attraction is much
less than the diameter of the particles, we find that at low temperatures
$g(h)$ decays in an oscillatory fashion with increasing $h$, leading to highly
structured terraced liquid droplets.

important as popularity. Novelty is the side effect of competition and aging in
evolving systems. Recent behavior or recent link gain in networks plays an
important role in emergence or trend. We exploited this wisdom and came up with
two models considering different scenarios and systems. Where recent behavior
dominates over total behavior (total link gain) in the first one, and recent
behavior is as important as total behavior for future link gain in second one.
It suppose that random walker walks on a network and can jump to any node, the
probablity of jumping or making connection to other node is based on which node
is recently more active or receiving more links. In our assumption random
walker can also jump to node which is already popular but recently not popular.
We are able to predict rising novelties or popular nodes which is generally
suppressed under preferential attachment effect. To show performance of our

algorithm, named Optimal-Jordan-Cover (OJC). The algorithm first extracts a
subgraph using a candidate selection algorithm that selects source candidates
based on the number of observed infected nodes in their neighborhoods. Then, in
the extracted subgraph, OJC finds a set of nodes that ""cover"" all observed
infected nodes with the minimum radius. The set of nodes is called the Jordan
cover, and is regarded as the set of diffusion sources. Considering the
heterogeneous susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) diffusion in the Erdos-Renyi

one asymptotically with partial observations. OJC is a polynomial-time
algorithm in terms of network size. However, the computational complexity
increases exponentially in $m,$ the number of sources. We further propose a
low-complexity heuristic based on the K-Means for approximating the Jordan

interest to the Indian community concerned with astrophysical turbulence and
magnetic fields. The SKA-I will allow observations of a large number of
background sources with detectable polarisation and measure their Faraday
depths (FDs) through the Milky Way, other galaxies and their circum-galactic
medium. This will probe line-of-sight magnetic fields in these objects well and
provide field configurations. Detailed comparison of observational data with
models which consider various processes giving rise to field amplification and
maintenance will then be possible. Such observations will also provide the
coherence scale of the fields and measure its random component. Measuring the
random component is important to characterise turbulence in the medium.
Observations of FDs with redshift will provide important information on
magnetic field evolution as a function of redshift. The background sources
could also be used to probe magnetic fields and its coherent scale in galaxy
clusters and in bridges formed between interacting galaxies. Other than FDs,
sensitive observations of synchrotron emission from galaxies will provide
complimentary information on their magnetic field strengths in the sky plane.
The core shift measurements of AGNs can provide more precise measurements of
magnetic field very close (<pc) to the black hole and its evolution. The low
band of SKA-I will also be useful to study circularly polarized emission from
Sun and comparing various models of field configurations with observations.

Collaborative Representation based Classification (CRC) has been employed
successfully to address the small-sample-size problem in computer vision.
However, the original CRC formulation is not well-suited for person
re-identification since it does not consider that probe and gallery samples are
from different cameras. Furthermore, it is a linear model, while appearance
changes caused by different camera conditions indicate a strong nonlinear
transition between cameras. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Kernel
Cross-View Collaborative Representation based Classification (Kernel X-CRC)
that represents probe and gallery images by balancing representativeness and
similarity nonlinearly. It assumes that a probe and its corresponding gallery
image are represented with similar coding vectors using individuals from the

this lack of correlation, a difference in line profiles between C$_4$H and

the CH$_3$OH tracing gas that has been transiently heated to high ($\sim$70-100
K) temperatures, and the C$_4$H tracing the cooler large-scale envelope where
CH$_4$ molecules have been liberated from ices. These results provide insight
in the differentiation between hot corino and warm carbon-chain chemistry in
embedded protostars.

$n=2$, it is known that the number of critical points (where $\nabla u=0$) is
related to the number of oscillations of the boundary condition independently
of the (positive) coefficient $\sigma$. We show that the situation is different
in dimension $n\geq3$. More precisely, we obtain that for any fixed (Dirichlet

set of smooth coefficients $\sigma(x)$ such that $\nabla u$ vanishes at least
at one point in $X$. By using estimates related to the Laplacian with mixed
boundary conditions, the result is first obtained for a piecewise constant
conductivity with infinite contrast, a problem of independent interest. A
second step shows that the topology of the vector field $\nabla u$ on a
subdomain is not modified for appropriate bounded, sufficiently high-contrast,
smooth coefficients $\sigma(x)$.
  These results find applications in the class of hybrid inverse problems,
where optimal stability estimates for parameter reconstruction are obtained in
the absence of critical points. Our results show that for any (finite number

it has been known that these events exhibit bluer spectral energy distributions
than other supernova subtypes, with significant output in the ultraviolet.
However, the event Gaia16apd seems to outshine even the other SLSNe at
rest-frame wavelengths below $\sim 3000$ \AA. Yan et al (2016) have recently
presented HST UV spectra and attributed the UV flux to low metallicity and
hence reduced line blanketing. Here we present UV and optical light curves over
a longer baseline in time, revealing a rapid decline at UV wavelengths despite
a typical optical evolution. Combining the published UV spectra with our own
optical data, we demonstrate that Gaia16apd has a much hotter continuum than
virtually any SLSN at maximum light, but it cools rapidly thereafter and is
indistinguishable from the others by $\sim 10$-15 days after peak. Comparing
the equivalent widths of UV absorption lines with those of other events, we
show that the excess UV continuum is a result of a more powerful central power
source, rather than a lack of UV absorption relative to other SLSNe or an
additional component from interaction with the surrounding medium. These
findings strongly support the central-engine hypothesis for hydrogen-poor
SLSNe. An explosion ejecting $M_{\rm ej} = 4 (0.2/\kappa)$ M$_\odot$, where
$\kappa$ is the opacity in cm$^2$g$^{-1}$, and forming a magnetar with spin
period $P=2$ ms, and $B=2\times10^{14}$ G (lower than other SLSNe with
comparable rise-times) can consistently explain the light curve evolution and
high temperature at peak. The host metallicity, $Z=0.18$ Z$_\odot$, is
comparable to other SLSNe.

trace the alpha-element evolution in our Galaxy. For chemical abundance
analysis, such as magnesium abundance, accurate and complete atomic data are
essential. Inaccurate atomic data lead to uncertain abundances and prevent
discrimination between different evolution models. Aims. We study the spectrum
of neutral magnesium from laboratory measurements and theoretical calculations.
Our aim is to improve the oscillator strengths ( f -values) of Mg I lines and
to create a complete set of accurate atomic data, particularly for the near-IR
region. Methods. We derived oscillator strengths by combining the experimental
branching fractions with radiative lifetimes reported in the literature and
computed in this work. A hollow cathode discharge lamp was used to produce free
atoms in the plasma and a Fourier transform spectrometer recorded the
intensity-calibrated high-resolution spectra. In addition, we performed
theoretical calculations using the multiconfiguration Hartree-Fock program
ATSP2K. Results. This project provides a set of experimental and theoretical
oscillator strengths. We derived 34 experimental oscillator strengths. Except
from the Mg I optical triplet lines (3p 3^P^o_0,1,2 - 4s 3^S_1), these
oscillator strengths are measured for the first time. The theoretical
oscillator strengths are in very good agreement with the experimental data and
complement the missing transitions of the experimental data up to n = 7 from
even and odd parity terms. We present an evaluated set of oscillator strengths,

notions in classical continuum mechanics which have attracted much attention
and controversy over the past decades. Particularly in turbulence modelling it
seems that there still is a need for clarification. The aim and purpose of this
study is fourfold: (i) To achieve consensus in general on definitions and
principles when trying to establish an invariant theory for modelling
constitutive structures and dynamic processes in mechanics, where special focus
is put on the principle of Material Frame-Indifference (MFI). (ii) To show that
in constitutive modelling MFI can only be regarded as an approximation that
needs to be reduced to a weaker statement when trying to advance it to an axiom
of nature. (iii) To convince that in dynamical modelling, as in turbulence, MFI
may not be utilized as a modelling guideline, not even in an approximative
sense. Instead, its reduced form has to be supplemented by a second,
independent axiom that includes the microscopic (fluctuating) description of
the dynamical processes. Concerning Navier-Stokes turbulence, the axiom of
Turbulent Frame-Indifference (TFI) is stated in which turbulence has to be
modelled consistently with the invariant properties of the deterministic
Navier-Stokes equations, and finally (iv) to propose a novel invariant
modelling ansatz both for constitutive and dynamical modelling that allows to
include the (mean) velocity field as an own independent modelling variable,
however, not in an absolute but only in the relative sense as a velocity
difference; a result that would systematically improve current modelling
procedures in extended thermodynamics and turbulence theory to be more
consistent with physical observations.

important path problems on both directed and undirected graphs, including APSP,
MWC (minimum weight cycle), and Eccentricities, which is the problem of
computing, for each vertex in the graph, the length of a longest shortest path
starting at that vertex.
  We introduce the notion of a sparse reduction which preserves the sparsity of
graphs, and we present near linear-time sparse reductions between various pairs
of graph problems in the $\tilde{O}(mn)$ class. Surprisingly, very few of the
known nontrivial reductions between problems in the $\tilde{O}(mn)$ class are
sparse reductions. In the directed case, our results give a partial order on a
large collection of problems in the $\tilde{O}(mn)$ class (along with some
equivalences). In the undirected case we give two nontrivial sparse reductions:
from MWC to APSP, and from unweighted ANSC (all nodes shortest cycles) to APSP.
The latter reduction also gives an improved algorithm for ANSC (for dense
graphs).
  We propose the MWC Conjecture, a new conditional hardness conjecture that the
weight of a minimum weight cycle in a directed graph cannot be computed in time
polynomially smaller than mn. Our sparse reductions for directed path problems
in the $\tilde{O}(mn)$ class establish that several problems in this class,
including 2-SiSP (second simple shortest path), Radius, and Eccentricities, are
MWCC hard. We also identify Eccentricities as a key problem in the

general relativity would rule out most or all (depending on the spin of the

measurement of two such events for final black holes with substantially
different spins would rule out the proposal for any $\alpha$. If the
modification of general relativity is confined to the near-horizon region

in healthcare predictive modeling, the sample size is insufficient for deep
learning methods to achieve satisfactory results. -Interpretation:The
representations learned by deep learning methods should align with medical
knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a GRaph-based Attention
Model, GRAM that supplements electronic health records (EHR) with hierarchical
information inherent to medical ontologies. Based on the data volume and the
ontology structure, GRAM represents a medical concept as a combination of its
ancestors in the ontology via an attention mechanism. We compared predictive
performance (i.e. accuracy, data needs, interpretability) of GRAM to various
methods including the recurrent neural network (RNN) in two sequential
diagnoses prediction tasks and one heart failure prediction task. Compared to
the basic RNN, GRAM achieved 10% higher accuracy for predicting diseases rarely
observed in the training data and 3% improved area under the ROC curve for
predicting heart failure using an order of magnitude less training data.
Additionally, unlike other methods, the medical concept representations learned
by GRAM are well aligned with the medical ontology. Finally, GRAM exhibits
intuitive attention behaviors by adaptively generalizing to higher level
concepts when facing data insufficiency at the lower level concepts.

On the other hand, recent simulations of the streaming instability have shown
that mm/cm-sized particles require an excessively high metallicity for dense
filaments to emerge. Using a numerical algorithm for stiff mutual drag force,
we perform simulations of small particles with significantly higher resolutions
and longer simulation times than in previous investigations. We find that
particles of dimensionless stopping time $\tau_\mathrm{s} = 10^{-2}$ and
$10^{-3}$ -- representing mm- and cm-sized particles interior of the water ice
line -- concentrate themselves via the streaming instability at a solid
abundance of a few percent. We thus revise a previously published critical
solid abundance curve for the regime of $\tau_\mathrm{s} \ll 1$. The solid
density in the concentrated regions reaches values higher than the Roche
density, indicating that direct collapse of particles down to mm sizes into
planetesimals is possible. Our results hence bridge the gap in particle size
between direct dust growth limited by bouncing and the streaming instability.

wants to utilize a channel which is occupied by a secondary user, the secondary
user should perform a proactive spectrum handoff to another channel and vacate
the selected channel before the primary user utilizes it. This scheme avoids
collision between the primary users and secondary users; moreover, increases
the throughput of the primary and secondary users. In this paper, a novel
proactive spectrum hand protocol based on the Greedy Channel Selection (GCS) is
proposed which avoids collision between secondary users, as well as, collision
between primary and secondary users. In the proposed scheme, proactive spectrum
handoff is based on the SRV (Single Rendezvous) coordination scheme; therefore,
the secondary users perform proactive spectrum handoff without using the common
control channel. Moreover, the channel selection is distributed which leads to
the higher throughput, and lower average service time. The proposed proactive

protocols. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed protocol outperforms
the other protocols regarding higher average throughput and lower average

Einstein and Fokker, provides a striking analogy to general relativity. In its
modern form, scalar gravity appears as the low-energy effective field theory of
the spontaneous breaking of conformal symmetry within a CFT, and is AdS/CFT
dual to the original Randall-Sundrum I model, but without a UV brane. Scalar
gravity faithfully exhibits several qualitative features of the cosmological
constant problem of standard gravity coupled to quantum matter, and the
Weinberg no-go theorem can be extended to this case as well. Remarkably, a
solution to the scalar gravity cosmological constant problem has been proposed,
where the key is a very small violation of the scalar equivalence principle,
which can be elegantly formulated as a particular type of deformation of the
CFT. In the dual AdS picture this involves implementing Goldberger-Wise radion
stabilization where the Goldberger-Wise field is a pseudo-Nambu Goldstone
boson. In quantum gravity however, global symmetries protecting pNGBs are not
expected to be fundamental. We provide a natural six-dimensional gauge theory
origin for this global symmetry and show that the violation of the equivalence
principle and the size of the vacuum energy seen by scalar gravity can
naturally be exponentially small. Our solution may be of interest for study of
non-supersymmetric CFTs in the spontaneously broken phase.

galactic-scale dynamical and astrophysical processes, while solving the
dynamics of SMBHs, SMBH binaries and surrounding stellar systems at sub-parsec
scales. The KETJU code includes Post-Newtonian terms in the equations of
motions of the SMBHs which enables a new SMBH merger criterion based on the
gravitational wave coalescence timescale pushing the merger separation of SMBHs
down to $\sim 0.005$ pc. We test the performance of our code by comparison to
NBODY7 and rVINE. We set up dynamically stable multi-component merger
progenitor galaxies to study the SMBH binary evolution during galaxy mergers.
In our simulation sample the SMBH binaries do not suffer from the final-parsec
problem, which we attribute to the non-spherical shape of the merger remnants.
For bulge-only models, the hardening rate decreases with increasing resolution,
whereas for models which in addition include massive dark matter halos the SMBH
binary hardening rate becomes practically independent of the mass resolution of
the stellar bulge. The SMBHs coalesce on average 200 Myr after the formation of
the SMBH binary. However, small differences in the initial SMBH binary
eccentricities can result in large differences in the SMBH coalescence times.
Finally, we discuss the future prospects of KETJU, which allows for a
straightforward inclusion of gas physics in the simulations.

16 strong FeII systems ($W_{\rm r}$(MgII $\lambda2796$) $\ge1.0$ \AA\ and
$W_{\rm r}$(FeII $\lambda2600$) or $W_{\rm FeII}$ $\ge1$ \AA) at $0.5<z<1.5$
using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and the Green Bank Telescope. We
report six new HI 21-cm absorption detections from our sample, which have
increased the known number of detections in strong MgII systems at this
redshift range by $\sim50$%. Combining our measurements with those in the
literature, we find that the detection rate of HI 21-cm absorption increases
with $W_{\rm FeII}$, being four times higher in systems with $W_{\rm FeII}$
$\ge1$ \AA\ compared to systems with $W_{\rm FeII}$ $<1$ \AA. The $N$(HI)
associated with the HI 21-cm absorbers would be $\ge 2 \times 10^{20}$
cm$^{-2}$, assuming a spin temperature of $\sim500$ K (based on HI 21-cm
absorption measurements of damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems at this redshift
range) and unit covering factor. We find that HI 21-cm absorption arises on an
average in systems with stronger metal absorption. We also find that quasars
with HI 21-cm absorption detected towards them have systematically higher
$E(B-V)$ values than those which do not. Further, by comparing the velocity
widths of HI 21-cm absorption lines detected in absorption- and galaxy-selected
samples, we find that they show an increasing trend (significant at
$3.8\sigma$) with redshift at $z<3.5$, which could imply that the absorption
originates from more massive galaxy haloes at high-$z$. Increasing the number
of HI 21-cm absorption detections at these redshifts is important to confirm
various trends noted here with higher statistical significance.

simple statistical methods that cannot take full advantage of available data.
To enable optimal usage of data provided by the Gaia mission, we present a
probabilistic approach that simultaneously constrains parameters of PLZ
relations and uncertainties in Gaia parallax measurements. We demonstrate this
approach by constraining PLZ relations of type $ab$ RR Lyrae stars in
near-infrared W1 and W2 bands, using Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS)
parallax measurements for a sample of $\approx100$ type $ab$ RR Lyrae stars
located within 2.5 kpc of the Sun. The fitted PLZ relations are consistent with
previous studies, and in combination with other data, deliver distances precise
to 6% (once various sources of uncertainty are taken into account). To a
precision of 0.05 mas ($1\sigma$), we do not find a statistically significant
offset in TGAS parallaxes for this sample of distant RR Lyrae stars (median
parallax of 0.8 mas and distance of 1.4 kpc). With only minor modifications,
our probabilistic approach can be used to constrain PLZ relations of other

Chandra is more efficient, for a given exposure, in detecting CT candidates in
current surveys (by a factor ~2), deep XMM-Newton pointings of bright sources
are vital to fully characterize their properties: NH distribution above 10^25

luminous CT AGN at high redshift are extremely rare, the future of CT studies
at high redshift will have to rely on the large area surveys currently

The resulting inflaton potential is linear with periodic modulations. We

emission based on the newly acquired UV imaging of the Hubble Deep UV legacy
survey (HDUV) conducted with the WFC3/UVIS camera on the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST). At the redshift of these sources, the HDUV F275W images partially probe
the ionizing continuum. By exploiting the HST multi-wavelength data available
in the HDUV/GOODS fields, models of the UV spectral energy distributions, and
detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the intergalactic medium absorption, we
estimate the absolute ionizing photon escape fractions of these galaxies to be
very high -- typically >60% (>13% for all sources at 90% likelihood). Our
findings are in broad agreement with previous studies that found only a small
fraction of galaxies to show high escape fraction. These six galaxies comprise
the largest sample yet of LyC leaking candidates at z~2 whose inferred LyC flux
has been cleanly observed at HST resolution. While three of our six candidates
show evidence of hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN), two of these are
heavily obscured and their LyC emission appears to originate from star-forming
regions rather than the central nucleus. This suggests an AGN-aided pathway for
LyC escape from these sources. Extensive multi-wavelength data in the GOODS
fields, especially the near-IR grism spectra from the 3D-HST survey, enable us
to study the candidates in detail and tentatively test some recently proposed
indirect methods to probe LyC leakage -- namely, the [OIII]/[OII] line ratio
and the H$\beta-$UV slope diagram. High-resolution spectroscopic followup of
our candidates will help constrain such indirect methods which are our only
hope of studying $f_{esc}$ at z~5-9 in the fast-approaching era of the James

spectroscopy can connect the high-order stellar kinematic moments h3
(~skewness) and h4 (~kurtosis) in galaxies to their cosmological assembly
history. Here, we assess these results by measuring the stellar kinematics on a
sample of 315 galaxies, without a morphological selection, using 2D integral
field data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey. A proxy for the spin parameter
($\lambda_{R_e}$) and ellipticity ($\epsilon_e$) are used to separate fast and
slow rotators; there exists a good correspondence to regular and non-regular
rotators, respectively, as also seen in earlier studies. We confirm that
regular rotators show a strong h3 versus $V/\sigma$ anti-correlation, whereas
quasi-regular and non-regular rotators show a more vertical relation in h3 and
$V/\sigma$. Motivated by recent cosmological simulations, we develop an
alternative approach to kinematically classify galaxies from their individual
h3 versus $V/\sigma$ signatures. We identify five classes of high-order stellar
kinematic signatures using Gaussian mixture models. Class 1 corresponds to slow
rotators, whereas Classes 2-5 correspond to fast rotators. We find that
galaxies with similar $\lambda_{R_e}-\epsilon_e$ values can show distinctly
different h3-$V/\sigma$ signatures. Class 5 objects are previously unidentified
fast rotators that show a weak h3 versus $V/\sigma$ anti-correlation. These
objects are predicted to be disk-less galaxies formed by gas-poor mergers. From
morphological examination, however, there is evidence for large stellar disks.
Instead, Class 5 objects are more likely disturbed galaxies, have
counter-rotating bulges, or bars in edge-on galaxies. Finally, we interpret the
strong anti-correlation in h3 versus $V/\sigma$ as evidence for disks in most
fast rotators, suggesting a dearth of gas-poor mergers among fast rotators.

the average cluster and cluster red sequence galaxies experienced no enhanced
star formation relative to the surrounding field during the merger, ruling out
a predominantly merger-quenched population. We find that the average blue
galaxy in the North cluster is currently active and in the South cluster is
currently post-starburst having undergone a recent star formation event. While
the North activity could be latent or long-term merger effects, a young blue
stellar population and irregular geometry suggest the cluster was still forming
prior the collision. While the South activity coincides with the time of the
merger, the blue early-type population could be a result of secular cluster
processes. The evidence suggests that the dearth or surfeit of activity is

simultaneously determined. We test light-curve based SN classification priors

classification methods and CC SN parameterizations on large SN simulations, we
estimate that CC SN contamination gives a systematic error on $w$

gives $\sigma_w^{CC} = 0.004$, just 8% of the statistical uncertainty, but

both VIPERS fields (W1 and W4), which is characteristic of linear redshift
space distortions. By measuring the projected cross-correlation and then
deprojecting it we are able to estimate the undistorted cross-correlation
function. We propose that given a sufficiently well measured cross-correlation
function one should be able to measure the linear growth rate of structure by
applying a simple linear Gaussian streaming model for the redshift space
distortions (RSD). Our study of voids in 306 mock galaxy catalogues mimicking
the VIPERS fields would suggest that VIPERS is capable of measuring $\beta$
with an error of around $25\%$. Applying our method to the VIPERS data, we find
a value for the redshift space distortion parameter, $\beta =

unparalleled sample of more than 2000 massive M > 10^11 M_sun passive galaxies
(MPGs) at redshift 0.5 < z < 1.0, based on their NUVrK colours. This enables us
to investigate how the population of these objects was built up over cosmic
time. We find that the evolution of the number density depends on the galaxy
mean surface stellar mass density, Sigma. In particular, dense (Sigma > 2000
M_sun pc^-2) MPGs show a constant comoving number density over this redshift
range, whilst this increases by a factor ~ 4 for the least dense objects,
defined as having Sigma < 1000 M_sun pc^-2. We estimate stellar ages for the
MPG population both fitting the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) and through
the D4000_n index, obtaining results in good agreement. Our findings are
consistent with passive ageing of the stellar content of dense MPGs. We show
that at any redshift the less dense MPGs are younger than dense ones and that
their stellar populations evolve at a slower rate than predicted by passive
evolution. This points to a scenario in which the overall population of MPGs
was built up over the cosmic time by continuous addition of less dense
galaxies: on top of an initial population of dense objects that passively
evolves, new, larger, and younger MPGs continuously join the population at
later epochs. Finally, we demonstrate that the observed increase in the number
density of MPGs is totally accounted for by the observed decrease in the number
density of correspondingly massive star forming galaxies (i.e. all the
non-passive M > 10^11 M_sun objects). Such systems observed at z ~ 1 in VIPERS,
therefore, represent the most plausible progenitors of the subsequent emerging
class of larger MPGs.

288 VIMOS fields with marginal overlaps, split over two regions within the
CFHTLS-Wide W1 and W4 equatorial fields (at R.A. ~2 and ~22 hours,

wavelength range 5500-9500 Angstrom. Data reduction and redshift measurements
were performed through a fully automated pipeline; all redshift determinations
were then visually validated and assigned a quality flag. Measurements with a
quality flag >= 2 are shown to have a confidence level of 96% or larger and
make up 88% of all measured galaxy redshifts (76,552 out of 86,775),

Survey (VIPERS) to investigate the effect of environment on the evolution of
galaxies between $z=0.5$ and $z=0.9$. We characterise local environment in
terms of the density contrast smoothed over a cylindrical kernel, the scale of
which is defined by the distance to the $5^{th}$ nearest neighbour. We find
that more massive galaxies tend to reside in higher-density environments over
the full redshift range explored. Defining star-forming and passive galaxies
through their (NUV$-r$) vs ($r-K$) colours, we then quantify the fraction of
star-forming over passive galaxies, $f_{\rm ap}$, as a function of environment
at fixed stellar mass. $f_{\rm ap}$ is higher in low-density regions for
galaxies with masses ranging from $\log(\mathcal{M}/\mathcal{M}_\odot)=10.38$
(the lowest value explored) to at least
$\log(\mathcal{M}/\mathcal{M}_\odot)\sim11.3$, although with decreasing
significance going from lower to higher masses. This is the first time that
environmental effects on high-mass galaxies are clearly detected at redshifts
as high as $z\sim0.9$. We compared these results to VIPERS-like galaxy mock
catalogues based on the galaxy formation model of De Lucia & Blaizot. The model
correctly reproduces $f_{\rm ap}$ in low-density environments, but
underpredicts it at high densities. The discrepancy is particularly strong for
the lowest-mass bins. We find that this discrepancy is driven by an excess of
low-mass passive satellite galaxies in the model. Looking at the accretion
history of these model galaxies, i.e. the times when they become satellites, a
better (yet not perfect) agreement with observations can be obtained in high
density regions by assuming either that a not-negligible fraction of satellites
is destroyed, or that their quenching time-scale is longer than $\sim 2$ Gyr.

explore the relationships between star-formation history (using d4000), stellar
mass and galaxy structure, and how these relationships have evolved since z~1.
We trace the extents and evolutions of both the blue cloud and red sequence, by
fitting double Gaussians to the d4000 distribution of galaxies in narrow
stellar mass bins, for four redshift intervals over 0<z<1. This reveals
downsizing in star formation, as the high-mass limit of the blue cloud retreats
steadily with time from M*~10^11.2 M_sun at z~0.9 to M*~10^10.7 M_sun by the
present day. The number density of massive blue-cloud galaxies (M*>10^11 M_sun,
d4000<1.55) drops sharply by a factor five between z~0.8 and z~0.5. These
galaxies are becoming quiescent at a rate that largely matches the increase in
the numbers of massive passive galaxies seen over this period. We examine the
size-mass relation of blue cloud galaxies, finding that its high-mass boundary
runs along lines of constant M*/r_e or equivalently inferred velocity
dispersion. Larger galaxies can continue to form stars to higher stellar masses
than smaller galaxies. As blue cloud galaxies approach this high-mass limit,
they start to be quenched, their d4000 values increasing to push them towards
the green valley. In parallel, their structures change, showing higher Sersic
indices and central stellar mass densities. For these galaxies, bulge growth is
necessary for them to reach the high-mass limit of the blue cloud and be
quenched by internal mechanisms. The blue cloud galaxies that are being
quenched at z~0.8 lie along the same size-mass relation as present day
quiescent galaxies, and seem the likely progenitors of today's S0s.

This paper shows how to extend ABCD by formulating it in terms of probabilistic

abstract syntax trees for a domain-specific probabilistic language, and (ii)
represent the time series model prior, likelihood, and search strategy using
probabilistic programs in a sufficiently expressive language. The final
probabilistic program is written in under 70 lines of probabilistic code in

involves a non-parametric extension to ABCD, experiments for interpolation and
extrapolation on real-world econometric data, and improvements in accuracy over
both non-parametric and standard regression baselines.

$\sim$2 mag soon after its perihelion passage, contradicting expectations from
the phase function of a macroscopic monolithic body. Subsequently, a short
antisolar tail of $\sim$0{\deg}.1 in length was formed within $\sim$1 day and
quickly disappeared. No trail was seen. Our syndyne-synchrone analysis
indicates that the tail was comprised of submicron to micron particles and can
be approximated by a synchrone coinciding with the outburst. We estimate that
the outburst has released a mass of $\sim$10$^{4}$--10$^{5}$ kg, comparable to
the two mass ejections in 2009 and 2012, and that the average mass-loss rate is
$\sim$0.1--1 kg s$^{-1}$. The forward-scattering effect hinted at low level
activity of Phaethon prior to the outburst, which increased the effective cross
section by merely $\lesssim$1 km$^2$. Without the forward-scattering
enhancement, detecting such activity at side-scattering phase angles is very
difficult. The forward-scattering effect also reinforces that the ejected dust
grains rather than gas emissions were responsible for the activity of Phaethon.
Despite Phaethon's reactivation, it is highly unlikely that the Geminid
meteoroid stream can be sustained by similar perihelion mass-loss events.

  noncommutative geometry and quantum electrodynamics","10 pages",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An analogy with real Clifford algebras on even-dimensional vector spaces
suggests to assign a couple of space and time dimensions modulo 8 to any
algebra (represented over a complex Hilbert space) containing two self-adjoint
involutions and an anti-unitary operator with specific commutation relations.
  It is shown that this assignment is compatible with the tensor product: the
space and time dimensions of the tensor product are the sums of the space and
time dimensions of its factors. This could provide an interpretation of the
presence of such algebras in PT-symmetric Hamiltonians or the description of
topological matter.
  This construction is used to build an indefinite (i.e. pseudo-Riemannian)
version of the spectral triples of noncommutative geometry, defined over Krein
spaces instead of Hilbert spaces. Within this framework, we can express the
Lagrangian (both bosonic and fermionic) of a Lorentzian almost-commutative
spectral triple. We exhibit a space of physical states that solves the
fermion-doubling problem. The example of quantum electrodynamics is described.

behavior in the radio was towards the end of the outburst where a fast,
luminous (""giant""), flare peaking at ~20 mJy and lasting for 15 minutes was
observed. This is the first time that such a flare has been observed in SS Cyg,

with synchrotron emission from plasma ejection events as being the origin of
the radio flares. However, the production of the giant flare during the
declining accretion rate phase remains unexplained within the standard
accretion-jet framework and appears to be markedly different to similar
patterns of behavior in X-ray binaries.

spectroscopic study of SmB6 which shows evidence for a V-shaped density of

interpreted in terms of the existence of heavy 4f surface states, which may be
useful in resolving the controversy concerning the disparate surface
Fermi-surface velocities observed in experiments. Most importantly, we find
that the temperature dependence of the valence-band spectrum indicates that a
small feature appears at a binding energy of about -9 meV at low temperatures.
We attribute this feature to a resonance caused by the spin-exciton scattering
in SmB6 which destroys the protection of surface states due to time-reversal
invariance and spin-momentum locking. The existence of a low-energy
spin-exciton may be responsible for the scattering which suppresses the
formation of coherent surface quasi-particles and the appearance of the
saturation of the resistivity to temperatures much lower than the coherence
temperature associated with the opening of the bulk gap.

polarization features than is typical, which has allowed us new insight into
the nature of normal SNe Ia. SN 2011fe exhibits time-dependent polarization in
both the continuum and strong absorption lines. At early epochs, red
wavelengths exhibit a degree of continuum polarization of up to 0.4\%, likely
indicative of a mild asymmetry in the electron-scattering photosphere. This
behavior is more common in sub-luminous SNe Ia than in normal events, such as
SN2011fe. The degree of polarization across a collection of absorption lines
varies dramatically from epoch to epoch. During the earliest epoch a
$\lambda$4600-5000 \AA\ complex of absorption lines shows enhanced polarization
at a different position angle than the continuum. We explore the origin of
these features, presenting a few possible interpretations, without arriving at
a single favored ion. During two epochs near maximum, the dominant polarization
feature is associated with the Si{\sc ii} $\lambda$6355 \AA\ absorption line.

flaring-like behavior, with typical rise and decay time scales of ~120 s. The
flares are accompanied by a remarkable spectral variability, with the X-ray
emission being generally softer at the peak of the flares. A strong quasi
periodic oscillation (QPO) is detected at ~8 mHz in the power spectrum of the

the strongest power at soft X-rays (<3 keV). We carried out a dedicated

produced by an heartbeat-like mechanism, similar to that operating in

suggested in the literature for a number of other neutron star binaries

the flare peak is 21 times the flux of the stellar photosphere in the broad

than the previously reported Kepler white light flares for the L1 dwarf WISEP

benefits of a common programming standard are clear; multiple vendors can
provide support for application descriptions written according to the standard,
thus reducing the program porting effort. While the standard brings the obvious
benefits of platform portability, the performance portability aspects are
largely left to the programmer. The situation is made worse due to multiple
proprietary vendor implementations with different characteristics, and, thus,
required optimization strategies.
  In this paper, we propose an OpenCL implementation that is both portable and
performance portable. At its core is a kernel compiler that can be used to
exploit the data parallelism of OpenCL programs on multiple platforms with
different parallel hardware styles. The kernel compiler is modularized to
perform target-independent parallel region formation separately from the
target-specific parallel mapping of the regions to enable support for various
styles of fine-grained parallel resources such as subword SIMD extensions, SIMD
datapaths and static multi-issue. Unlike previous similar techniques that work
on the source level, the parallel region formation retains the information of
the data parallelism using the LLVM IR and its metadata infrastructure. This
data can be exploited by the later generic compiler passes for efficient
parallelization.
  The proposed open source implementation of OpenCL is also platform portable,
enabling OpenCL on a wide range of architectures, both already commercialized
and on those that are still under research. The paper describes how the
portability of the implementation is achieved. Our results show that most of
the benchmarked applications when compiled using pocl were faster or close to
as fast as the best proprietary OpenCL implementation for the platform at hand.

nonlinear coupling of the pump to the Anderson pseudospins of the
superconductor induces coherent dynamics of the Higgs (amplitude) mode
$\Delta(t)$. We validate this picture in a two-dimensional BCS model with a
combination of exact numerics and the Lax reduction method, and we compute the

effect of the pump is to scramble the orientations of Anderson pseudospins
along the Fermi surface by twisting them in the $xy$-plane. We show that more
intense pump pulses can induce a far-from-equilibrium phase of gapless

have shown that the phenomenology predicted by this model is much richer than
previously believed. By releasing the constraint that the attraction band is
symmetric with respect to the chemical potential of the system, we observed
that the energy gap may have more than one solution, the quasiparticle
imbalance may appear in equilibrium, and the transition between the
superconducting and the normal metal phases may be of the first order. The
temperature of the superconductor-normal metal phase transition changes with
the asymmetry of the attraction band and if we plot the phase transition
temperature vs the chemical potential, we obtain a bell shaped curve, similarly
to the superconducting dome, generally formed in high-Tc superconductors, but
also in superconductors with narrow conduction bands.
  While the pairing interaction is a microscopic characteristic of the system,
determined by the effective interactions between constituent quasiparticles,
the chemical potential is a macroscopic quantity, which can be changed by
external conditions, like doping and pressure. Furthermore, if the conduction
band of the system is narrow, then the attraction band is constrained to the
conduction band and the chemical potential is not necessary in the center, as
it happens in some of the bands in In-doped Pb$_z$Sn$_{1-z}$ and in MgB$_{2}$.
For these reasons, the constraint that the attraction band is symmetric with

Galactic Center (GC) with the MAGIC telescopes. These observations were
primarily motivated by reports that a putative gas cloud (G2) would be passing
in close proximity to the super-massive black hole (SMBH), associated with
Sagittarius A*, located at the center of our galaxy. This event was expected to
give astronomers a unique chance to study the effect of in-falling matter on
the broad-band emission of a SMBH.
  Aims. We search for potential flaring emission of very-high-energy (VHE;
$\geq$100 GeV) gamma rays from the direction of the SMBH at the GC due to the
passage of the G2 object. Using these data we also study the morphology of this
complex region.
  Methods. We observed the GC region with the MAGIC Imaging Atmospheric
Cherenkov Telescopes during the period 2012-2015, collecting 67 hours of
good-quality data. In addition to a search for variability in the flux and
spectral shape of the GC gamma-ray source, we use a point-source subtraction
technique to remove the known gamma-ray emitters located around the GC in order
to reveal the TeV morphology of the extended emission inside that region.
  Results. No effect of the G2 object on the VHE gamma-ray emission from the GC
was detected during the 4 year observation campaign. We confirm previous
measurements of the VHE spectrum of Sagittarius A*, and do not detect any
significant variability of the emission from the source. Furthermore, the known
VHE gamma-ray emitter at the location of the supernova remnant G0.9+0.1 was
detected, as well as the recently discovered VHE source close to the GG radio
Arc.

its peak electricity demand by offering a fixed group of customers a uniform
price for reductions in consumption relative to their predetermined baselines.
The underlying demand curve, which describes the aggregate reduction in
consumption in response to the offered price, is assumed to be affine and
subject to unobservable random shocks. Assuming that both the parameters of the
demand curve and the distribution of the random shocks are initially unknown to
the utility, we investigate the extent to which the utility might dynamically
adjust its offered prices to maximize its cumulative risk-sensitive payoff over
a finite number of $T$ days. In order to do so effectively, the utility must
design its pricing policy to balance the tradeoff between the need to learn the
unknown demand model (exploration) and maximize its payoff (exploitation) over
time. In this paper, we propose such a pricing policy, which is shown to
exhibit an expected payoff loss over $T$ days that is at most
$O(\sqrt{T}\log(T))$, relative to an oracle pricing policy that knows the
underlying demand model. Moreover, the proposed pricing policy is shown to
yield a sequence of prices that converge to the oracle optimal prices in the
mean square sense.

relationship between stresses and elongations of the springs. On the other

This model results in an input-output operator, which has many good

representations of complex data and performing inference of input data by
exploring the generative ability. However, it is relatively insufficient to
empower the discriminative ability of DGMs on making accurate predictions. This
paper presents max-margin deep generative models (mmDGMs) and a
class-conditional variant (mmDCGMs), which explore the strongly discriminative
principle of max-margin learning to improve the predictive performance of DGMs
in both supervised and semi-supervised learning, while retaining the generative
capability. In semi-supervised learning, we use the predictions of a max-margin
classifier as the missing labels instead of performing full posterior inference
for efficiency; we also introduce additional max-margin and label-balance
regularization terms of unlabeled data for effectiveness. We develop an
efficient doubly stochastic subgradient algorithm for the piecewise linear
objectives in different settings. Empirical results on various datasets
demonstrate that: (1) max-margin learning can significantly improve the
prediction performance of DGMs and meanwhile retain the generative ability; (2)
in supervised learning, mmDGMs are competitive to the best fully discriminative
networks when employing convolutional neural networks as the generative and
recognition models; and (3) in semi-supervised learning, mmDCGMs can perform
efficient inference and achieve state-of-the-art classification results on
several benchmarks.

sense that it establishes that any Morita equivalence between $C^*(E)$ and
$C^*(F)$ in this class can be realized by a sequence of moves leading from $E$
to $F$, in a way resembling the role of Reidemeister moves on knots. As a key

the graph algebras invariant, and prove that after this augmentation, the list
of moves becomes complete in the sense described above.
  Along the way, we prove that every ordered, reduced filtered $K$-theory

$K$-theory isomorphism preserving the class of the unit comes from a
$*$-isomorphism between the unital graph $C^*$-algebras themselves.
  It follows that the question of Morita equivalence amongst unital graph

statistical quality of service (QoS) constraints is studied. The statistical
QoS constraints are imposed as limitations on delay violation probabilities. In
the absence of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter, truncated
hybrid automatic repeat request-incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR) is
incorporated to make better use of the wireless channel and the resources for
each communication link. The packets that cannot be successfully received upon
the maximum number of transmissions will be removed from buffer, i.e., outage
occurs. The \emph{outage effective capacity} of a communication link is defined
as the maximum constant arrival rate to the source that can be supported by the
\emph{goodput} departure processes, i.e., the departure that can be
successfully received by the receiver. Then, the outage effective capacity for
the buffer-aided diamond relay system is obtained for HARQ-IR incorporated
transmission strategy under the \emph{end-to-end} delay constraints. In
comparison with the DF protocol with perfect CSI at the transmitters, it is
shown that HARQ-IR can achieve superior performance when the SNR levels at the
relay are not so large or when the delay constraints are stringent.

upper limit on HeII paired with detection of OIII] and CIV constrains possible
ionization scenarios. Production of CIV and OIII] requires ionizing photons of
2.5-3.5 Ryd, but once in that state their multiplet emission is powered by
collisional excitation at lower energies (~0.5 Ryd). As a pure recombination
line, HeII emission is powered by 4 Ryd ionizing photons. The data therefore
require a spectrum with significant power at 3.5 Ryd but a rapid drop toward
4.0 Ryd. This hard spectrum with a steep drop is characteristic of
low-metallicity stellar populations, and less consistent with soft AGN
excitation, which features more 4 Ryd photons and hence higher HeII flux. The
conclusions based on ratios of metal line detections to Helium non-detection
are strengthened if the gas metallicity is low. RXJ2248-ID3 adds to the growing
handful of reionization-era galaxies with UV emission line ratios distinct from
the general z=2-3 population, in a way that suggests hard ionizing spectra that

formulate this problem as a one-dimensional Schr\""{o}dinger equation with a

the particle in a box, a canonical example of quantum mechanics, and we present
analytic and numerical investigations on this problem. After deriving an exact
Volterra-type integral equation, composed of an infinite sum of modes, we show
that approximate formulas with the lowest-frequency modes correctly capture the
qualitative behavior of the wave function. If we take into account hundreds of
modes, our numerical calculation shows that the quantum adiabatic theorem
actually gives a very good approximation even if the barrier height diverges
within finite time, as long as it is sufficiently longer than the
characteristic time scale of the particle. In particular, if the barrier is
slowly inserted at an asymmetric position, the particle is localized by the
insertion itself, in accordance with a prediction of the adiabatic theorem. On
the other hand, when the barrier is inserted quickly, the wave function becomes
rugged after the insertion because of the energy transfer to the particle.
Regardless of the position of the barrier, the fast insertion leaves the
particle unlocalized so that we can obtain meaningful information by a
which-side measurement. Our numerical procedure provides a precise way to
calculate the wave function throughout the process, from which one can estimate
the amount of this information for an arbitrary insertion protocol.

Ru-metal to grow side by side by forming a commensurate superlattice structure
at the interface. In an attempt to shed light as to why this happens, we
investigated the atomic structure and electronic properties of the interface

matter (PNM) on the basis of unitary-gas considerations. We discuss its
justification from experimental studies of cold atoms as well as from
theoretical studies of neutron matter. We demonstrate that this bound results
in limits to the density-dependent symmetry energy, which is the difference
between the energies of symmetric nuclear matter and PNM. In particular, this
bound leads to a lower limit to the volume symmetry energy parameter $S_0$. In
addition, for assumed values of $S_0$ above this minimum, this bound implies
both upper and lower limits to the symmetry energy slope parameter $L$, which
describes the lowest-order density dependence of the symmetry energy. A lower
bound on the neutron-matter incompressibility is also obtained. These bounds
are found to be consistent with both recent calculations of the energies of PNM
and constraints from nuclear experiments. Our results are significant because
several equations of state that are currently used in astrophysical simulations
of supernovae and neutron star mergers, as well as in nuclear physics
simulations of heavy-ion collisions, have symmetry energy parameters that
violate these bounds. Furthermore, below the nuclear saturation density, the
bound on neutron-matter energies leads to a lower limit to the
density-dependent symmetry energy, which leads to upper limits to the nuclear
surface symmetry parameter and the neutron-star crust-core boundary. We also
obtain a lower limit to the neutron-skin thicknesses of neutron-rich nuclei.
Above the nuclear saturation density, the bound on neutron-matter energies also

establish a framework to analyze Min-Sum to solve voltage and flow problems. We
characterize the error committed by the algorithm on general weighted graphs in

the total variation distance between the distributions of non-backtracking

nuclei (AGNs) is from the hot corona above the cool accretion disk. However,
the formation of the corona is still debated. Liu et al. investigated the
spectrum of the corona heated by the reconnection of the magnetic field
generated by dynamo action in the thin disk and emerging into the corona as a
result of buoyancy instability. In the present paper, we improve this model to
interpret the observed relation of the hard X-ray spectrum becoming softer at
higher accretion rate in luminous AGNs. The magnetic field is characterized by
$\beta_{\rm 0}$, i.e., the ratio of the sum of gas pressure and radiation
pressure to magnetic pressure in the disk ($\beta_{\rm 0}=(P_{\rm g,d}+P_{\rm
r,d})/P_{\rm B}$). Besides, both the intrinsic disk photons and reprocessed
photons by the disk are included as the seed photons for inverse Compton
scattering. These improvements are crucial for investigating the effect of
magnetic field on the accretion disk-corona when it is not clear whether the
radiation pressure or gas pressure dominates in thin disk. We change the value
of $\beta_{\rm 0}$ in order to constrain the magnetic field in the accretion
disk. We find that the energy fraction released in the corona ($f$) gradually
increases with the decrease of $\beta_{\rm 0}$ for the same accretion rate.
When $\beta_{\rm 0}$ decreases to less than 50, the structure and spectrum of
the disk-corona is independent on accretion rate, which is similar to the hard
spectrum found in Liu et al.(2003). Comparing with the observational results of
the hard X-ray bolometric correction factor in a sample of luminous AGNs, we
suggest that the value of $\beta_{\rm 0}$ is about 100-200 for $\alpha=0.3$ and
the energy fraction $f$ should be larger than $30\%$ for hard X-ray emission.

threshold to black-hole formation under realistic conditions. Using the results
from a large number of numerical simulations in full general relativity of
binary neutron star mergers described with various equations of state and

modest dependence on the equation of state, thus exhibiting the traits of
""quasi-universality"" found in other aspects of compact stars, both isolated and
in binary systems. The distributions are characterized by an almost uniformly
rotating core and a ""disk"". Such a configuration is significantly different
from the $j-{\rm constant}$ differential-rotation law that is commonly adopted
in equilibrium models of differentially rotating stars. Furthermore, the
rest-mass contained in such a disk can be quite large, ranging from $\simeq
0.03\,M_{\odot}$ in the case of high-mass binaries with stiff equations of
state, up to $\simeq 0.2\,M_{\odot}$ for low-mass binaries with soft equations

path in the special Euclidean algebra. By shape we mean all those geometric
features that are invariant under isometries of the three-dimensional ambient
space. The representation of the shape as a path in the special Euclidean
algebra is intrinsic to the description of the mechanical properties of a rod,
since it is given directly in terms of the strain fields that stimulate the
elastic response of special Cosserat rods. Moreover, such a representation
leads naturally to discretization schemes that avoid the need for the expensive
reconstruction of the strains from the discretized placement and for
interpolation procedures which introduce some arbitrariness in popular
numerical schemes. Given the shape of a rod and the positioning of one of its
cross sections, the full placement in the ambient space can be uniquely
reconstructed and described by means of a base curve endowed with a material
frame. By viewing a geometric curve as a rod with degenerate point-like cross
sections, we highlight the essential difference between rods and framed curves,
and clarify why the family of relatively parallel adapted frames is not
suitable for describing the mechanics of rods but is the appropriate tool for
dealing with the geometry of curves.

understanding. However, the process of manual labelling is both time-consuming
and labor intensive. To reduce the cost of manual labelling, there has been
increased research interest in automatically constructing image datasets by
exploiting web images. Datasets constructed by existing methods tend to have a
weak domain adaptation ability, which is known as the ""dataset bias problem"".
To address this issue, we present a novel image dataset construction framework
that can be generalized well to unseen target domains. Specifically, the given
queries are first expanded by searching the Google Books Ngrams Corpus to
obtain a rich semantic description, from which the visually non-salient and
less relevant expansions are filtered out. By treating each selected expansion
as a ""bag"" and the retrieved images as ""instances"", image selection can be
formulated as a multi-instance learning problem with constrained positive bags.
We propose to solve the employed problems by the cutting-plane and
concave-convex procedure (CCCP) algorithm. By using this approach, images from
different distributions can be kept while noisy images are filtered out. To
verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we build an image dataset
with 20 categories. Extensive experiments on image classification,
cross-dataset generalization, diversity comparison and object detection
demonstrate the domain robustness of our dataset.

transforms into another liquid via the first-order transition. For molecular

metastable against crystallization, which has led to a number of serious
debates concerning its origin: liquid-liquid transition vs. unusual
nano-crystal formation. Thus, there have so far been no single example free
from such debates. Here we show the first firm experimental evidence that the
transition is truly liquid-liquid transition and not nano-crystallization for a
molecular liquid, triphenyl phosphite. We kinetically isolate the reverse
liquid-liquid transition from glass transition and crystallization with an
extremely high heating rate of flash differential scanning calorimetry, and
prove the reversibility and first-order nature of liquid-liquid transition. Our

extended sources imaged in the slow-scan pointed observation mode of the
Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) aboard the AKARI Infrared Astronomical Satellite.
Our method recovers correct surface brightness distribution maps by re-scaling
archived raw FIS maps using the surface-brightness-dependent inverse FIS
response function. The flux of a target source is then automatically corrected
for as the simple sum of surface brightnesses within the adopted contour
encircling the perimeter of the target (i.e., contour photometry). This
correction method is contrasted to the previous aperture photometry method for
point sources, which directly corrects for the target flux with a
flux-dependent scaling law. The new surface brightness correction scheme is
applicable to objects of any shape from unresolved point sources to resolved
extended objects, as long as the target is not deemed diffuse, i.e., the total
extent of the target source does not exceed too much more than a single FIS
scan width of 10 arcmin. The new correction method takes advantage of the
well-defined shape (i.e., the scale invariance) of the point-spread function,
which enables us to adopt a power-law FIS response function. We analyze the
point-source photometric calibrator data using the FIS AKARI Slow-scan Tool
(FAST) and constrained the parameters of the adopted power-law FIS response
function. We conclude that the photometric accuracy of the new correction
method is better than 10% error based on comparisons with the expected fluxes

can be tested because supernovae also produce telltale patterns of short-lived

argue that these difficulties either do not arise or are mitigated if the

protecting a finite set of targets of different values. An attacker, knowing
the defender's strategy, chooses which target to attack and for how long. If
the attacker spends time $t$ at a target $i$ of value $\alpha_i$, and if he
leaves before the defender visits the target, his utility is $t \cdot \alpha_i
$; if the defender visits before he leaves, his utility is 0. The defender's

a schedule for visiting the targets; it takes her unit time to switch between
targets. Such games are a simplified model of a number of real-world scenarios
such as protecting computer networks from intruders, crops from thieves, etc.
  We show that optimal defender play for this continuous time security games
reduces to the solution of a combinatorial question regarding the existence of
infinite sequences over a finite alphabet, with the following properties for
each symbol $i$: (1) $i$ constitutes a prescribed fraction $p_i$ of the
sequence. (2) The occurrences of $i$ are spread apart close to evenly, in that
the ratio of the longest to shortest interval between consecutive occurrences
is bounded by a parameter $K$. We call such sequences $K$-quasi-regular.

defender play. What is more, even randomized $2$-quasi-regular sequences
suffice for optimality. We show that such sequences always exist, and can be
calculated efficiently.
  The question of the least $K$ for which deterministic $K$-quasi-regular
sequences exist is fascinating. Using an ergodic theoretical approach, we show

a matrix polynomial is to embed the matrix polynomial into a matrix pencil,
transforming the problem into an equivalent generalized eigenvalue problem.
Such pencils are known as linearizations. Many of the families of
linearizations for matrix polynomials available in the literature are
extensions of the so-called family of Fiedler pencils. These families are known
as generalized Fiedler pencils, Fiedler pencils with repetition and generalized
Fiedler pencils with repetition, or Fiedler-like pencils for simplicity. The
goal of this work is to unify the Fiedler-like pencils approach with the more
recent one based on strong block minimal bases pencils introduced in
\cite{canonical}. To this end, we introduce a family of pencils that we have
named extended block Kronecker pencils, whose members are, under some generic
nonsingularity conditions, strong block minimal bases pencils, and show that,
with the exception of the non proper generalized Fiedler pencils, all
Fiedler-like pencils belong to this family modulo permutations. As a
consequence of this result, we obtain a much simpler theory for Fiedler-like
pencils than the one available so far. Moreover, we expect this unification to
allow for further developments in the theory of Fiedler-like pencils such as
global or local backward error analyses and eigenvalue conditioning analyses of
polynomial eigenvalue problems solved via Fiedler-like linearizations.

network have been applied in ASR successfully. Given the arising problem of
training speed, we build a novel deep recurrent convolutional network for
acoustic modeling and then apply deep residual learning to it. Our experiments
show that it has not only faster convergence speed but better recognition
accuracy over traditional deep convolutional recurrent network. In the
experiments, we compare the convergence speed of our novel deep recurrent
convolutional networks and traditional deep convolutional recurrent networks.
With faster convergence speed, our novel deep recurrent convolutional networks
can reach the comparable performance. We further show that applying deep
residual learning can boost the convergence speed of our novel deep recurret
convolutional networks. Finally, we evaluate all our experimental networks by
phoneme error rate (PER) with our proposed bidirectional statistical n-gram
language model. Our evaluation results show that our newly proposed deep
recurrent convolutional network applied with deep residual learning can reach
the best PER of 17.33\% with the fastest convergence speed on TIMIT database.
The outstanding performance of our novel deep recurrent convolutional neural
network with deep residual learning indicates that it can be potentially
adopted in other sequential problems.

optimal strategies, all controllers compute common estimates of the states of
the plants based on the common information obtained from the communication

described with a set of exponential functions. From these exponential
functions, a set of power laws indicative of scaling can be derived. Hierarchy
structure and spatial network proved to be associated with one another. This
paper is devoted to exploring the theory of fractal analysis of complex systems
by means of hierarchical scaling. Two research methods are utilized to make
this study, including logic analysis method and empirical analysis method. The
main results are as follows. First, a fractal system such as Cantor set is
described from the hierarchical angle of view; based on hierarchical structure,
three approaches are proposed to estimate fractal dimension. Second, the
hierarchical scaling can be generalized to describe multifractals, fractal
complementary sets, and self-similar curve such as logarithmic spiral. Third,
complex systems such as urban systems are demonstrated to be a self-similar
hierarchy. The human settlements in Germany and the population of different
languages in the world are taken as two examples to make empirical analyses.
This study may be revealing for associating fractal analysis with other types
of scaling analysis of complex systems, and spatial optimization theory may be
developed in future by combining the theories of fractals, allometry, and
hierarchy.

good agreement with results calculated by taking energy differences where

time-dependent settings. The function $g$ is monotone, but it is not bounded
from below. With the exception of the logarithmic coupling, this is the first
time that MFGs whose coupling is not bounded from below is examined in the
literature. This coupling arises in models where agents have a strong
preference for low-density regions. Paradoxically, this causes the agents to
spread and prevents the creation of solutions with a very-low density. To prove
the existence of solutions, we consider an approximate problem for which the
existence of smooth solutions is known. Then, we prove new a priori bounds for
the solutions that show that $\frac 1 m$ is bounded. Finally, using a limiting
argument, we obtain the existence of solutions. The proof in the stationary
case relies on a blow-up argument and in the time-dependent case on new bounds

contain hundreds of stellar streams at the solar vicinity, fossil relics of the

of galaxies. Because of the mixing time scales in the inner Galaxy, it has been
claimed that these streams should be difficult to detect in configuration space
but can still be identifiable in kinematic-related spaces like the
energy/angular momenta spaces, E-Lz and Lperp-Lz, or spaces of orbital/velocity
parameters. By means of high-resolution, dissipationless N-body simulations,
containing between 25$\times10^6$ and 35$\times10^6$ particles, we model the
accretion of a series of up to four 1:10 mass ratio satellites then up to eight
1:100 satellites and we search systematically for the signature of these
accretions in these spaces. In all spaces considered (1) each satellite gives
origin to several independent overdensities; (2) overdensities of multiple
satellites overlap; (3) satellites of different masses can produce similar
substructures; (4) the overlap between the in-situ and the accreted population
is considerable everywhere; (5) in-situ stars also form substructures in
response to the satellite(s) accretion. These points are valid even if the
search is restricted to kinematically-selected halo stars only. As we are now
entering the 'Gaia era', our results warn that an extreme caution must be
employed before interpreting overdensities in any of those spaces as evidence
of relics of accreted satellites. Reconstructing the accretion history of our
Galaxy will require a substantial amount of accurate spectroscopic data, that,
complemented by the kinematic information, will possibly allow us to
(chemically) identify accreted streams and measure their orbital properties.

confinement and hadron mass scales does not appear explicitly in the QCD
Lagrangian. However, de Alfaro, Fubini, and Furlan have shown that a mass scale
can appear in the equations of motion without affecting the conformal
invariance of the action if one adds a term to the Hamiltonian proportional to
the dilatation operator or the special conformal operator. Applying the same
procedure to the light-front Hamiltonian leads to a unique confinement
potential $\kappa^4 \zeta^2$ for mesons, where $\zeta$ is the LF radial
variable conjugate to the invariant mass. The same result, including spin
terms, is obtained using light-front holography, the duality between the front
form and AdS$_5,$ if one modifies the action by the dilaton $e^{\kappa^2 z^2}$
in the fifth dimension $z$. Generalizing this procedure using superconformal
algebra, leads to a unified Regge spectroscopy of meson, baryon, and
tetraquarks, including remarkable supersymmetric relations between the masses
of mesons and baryons of the same parity. One also predicts observables such as
hadron structure functions, transverse momentum distributions, and the
distribution amplitudes defined from the hadronic light-front wavefunctions.
The mass scale underlying confinement and hadron masses can be connected to the
mass parameter in the QCD running coupling by matching the nonperturbative
dynamics to the perturbative QCD regime. The result is an effective coupling
defined at all momenta and the determination of a momentum scale which sets the

universe. In the first method, we study the evolution of the curvature
parameter ($\Omega_k^0$) with redshift by using the observations of the Hubble
parameter and transverse comoving distances obtained from the age of galaxies.
Secondly, we also use an indirect method based on the mean image separation
statistics of gravitationally lensed quasars. The basis of this methodology is
that the average image separation of lensed images will show a positive,
negative or zero correlation with the source redshift in a closed, open or flat
universe respectively. In order to smoothen the datasets used in both the
methods, we use a non-parametric method namely, Gaussian Process (GP). Finally
from first method we obtain $\Omega_k^0= 0.025\pm0.57$ for a presumed flat
universe while the cosmic curvature remains constant throughout the redshift
region $0<z<1.37$ which indicates that the universe may be homogeneous.
Moreover, the combined result from both the methods suggests that the universe
is marginally closed. However, a flat universe can be incorporated at $3\sigma$
level.

emerged as a newly active research subject because of its excellent performance
in many applications. Learning representations of words is a pioneering study
in this school of research. However, paragraph (or sentence and document)
embedding learning is more suitable/reasonable for some tasks, such as
sentiment classification and document summarization. Nevertheless, as far as we
are aware, there is relatively less work focusing on the development of
unsupervised paragraph embedding methods. Classic paragraph embedding methods
infer the representation of a given paragraph by considering all of the words
occurring in the paragraph. Consequently, those stop or function words that
occur frequently may mislead the embedding learning process to produce a misty
paragraph representation. Motivated by these observations, our major
contributions in this paper are twofold. First, we propose a novel unsupervised
paragraph embedding method, named the essence vector (EV) model, which aims at
not only distilling the most representative information from a paragraph but
also excluding the general background information to produce a more informative
low-dimensional vector representation for the paragraph. Second, in view of the
increasing importance of spoken content processing, an extension of the EV
model, named the denoising essence vector (D-EV) model, is proposed. The D-EV
model not only inherits the advantages of the EV model but also can infer a
more robust representation for a given spoken paragraph against imperfect
speech recognition.

nanorings. Half-integer numbers of resonant modes are observed due to the
presence of an extra phase {\pi} provided by the topology of the M\""obius
nanostrip. Anomalous plasmon modes located at the non-orientable surface of the
M\""obius nanoring break the symmetry that exist in conventional ring cavities,
thus enable far-field excitation and emission as bright modes. The far-field
resonant wavelength as well as the feature of half-integer mode numbers is
invariant to the change of charge distribution on the M\""obius nanoring due to
the nontrivial topology. Owing to the ultra-small mode volume induced by the
remaining dark feature, an extremely high sensitivity as well as a remarkable
figure of merit is obtained in sensing performance. The topological metallic
nanostructure provides a novel platform for the investigation of localized
surface plasmon modes exhibiting unique phenomena in plasmonic applications
such as high sensitive detection and plasmonic nanolasers.

facilitate detection by constraining the locations to search. But can context
directly benefit object detection? To do so, context needs to be learned
independently from target features. This is impossible in traditional object
detection where classifiers are trained on images containing both target
features and surrounding context. In contrast, humans can learn context and
target features separately, such as when we see highways without cars. Here we
show for the first time that human-derived scene expectations can be used to
improve object detection performance in machines. To measure contextual
expectations, we asked human subjects to indicate the scale, location and
likelihood at which cars or people might occur in scenes without these objects.
Humans showed highly systematic expectations that we could accurately predict
using scene features. This allowed us to predict human expectations on novel
scenes without requiring manual annotation. On augmenting deep neural networks
with predicted human expectations, we obtained substantial gains in accuracy
for detecting cars and people (1-3%) as well as on detecting associated objects
(3-20%). In contrast, augmenting deep networks with other conventional features
yielded far smaller gains. This improvement was due to relatively poor matches
at highly likely locations being correctly labelled as target and conversely
strong matches at unlikely locations being correctly rejected as false alarms.
Taken together, our results show that augmenting deep neural networks with
human-derived context features improves their performance, suggesting that
humans learn scene context separately unlike deep networks.

cooperative feedback scheme, where the users first exchange their CSI with each

Analytical results are derived to show that the cooperative precoder feedback
is more efficient than the CSI feedback in terms of interference mitigation.
Under the constraint of limited D2D communication capacity, we develop an
adaptive CSI exchange strategy based on signal subspace projection and optimal
bit partition. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative
precoder feedback scheme with adaptive CSI exchange significantly outperforms
the CSI feedback scheme, even when the CSI is exchanged via rate-limited D2D

systems of partial differential equations is ill-posed in Gevrey spaces, under
the assumption of an initial ellipticity. The assumption bears on the principal
symbol of the first-order operator. Ill-posedness means instability in the
sense of Hadamard, specifically an instantaneous defect of H\""older continuity
of the flow from $G^{\sigma}$ to $L^2$, where $\sigma\in(0,1)$ depends on the
initial spectrum. Building on the analysis carried out by G. M\'etivier
[\textit{Remarks on the well-posedness of the nonlinear Cauchy problem},
Contemp. Math. 2005], we show that ill-posedness follows from a long-time
Cauchy-Kovalevskaya construction of a family of exact, highly oscillating,
analytical solutions which are initially close to the null solution, and which
grow exponentially fast in time. A specific difficulty resides in the
observation time of instability. While in Sobolev spaces, this time is
logarithmic in the frequency, in Gevrey spaces it is a power of the frequency.
In particular, in Gevrey spaces the instability is recorded much later than in
Sobolev spaces.

as $1/R^{4}$ such that the field-dressed scattering length can be determined
without any formal difficulty. The scattering dynamics are essentially governed
by the long-range part of the interatomic interaction and can thus be
accurately described by an asymptotic model [Crubellier et al., New J. Phys.

and space complexity. In this context, we study the problem of (exact) counting
resource-limited and passively mobile nodes in the model of population
protocols, in which the space complexity is crucial. The counted nodes are
memory-limited anonymous devices (called agents) communicating asynchronously
in pairs (according to a fairness condition). Moreover, we assume that these
agents are prone to failures so that they cannot be correctly initialized. This
study considers two classical fairness conditions, and for each we investigate
the issue of time optimality of counting given the optimal space per agent. In
the case of randomly interacting agents (probabilistic fairness), as usual, the
convergence time is measured in terms of parallel time (or parallel
interactions), which is defined as the number of pairwise interactions until
convergence, divided by n (the number of agents). In case of weak fairness,
where it is only required that every pair of agents interacts infinitely often,
the convergence time is defined in terms of non-null transitions, i.e, the
transitions that affect the states of the interacting agents.First, assuming
probabilistic fairness, we present a ""non-guessing"" time optimal protocol of
O(n log n) expected time given an optimal space of only one bit, and we prove
the time optimality of this protocol. Then, for weak fairness, we show that a
space optimal (semi-uniform) solution cannot converge faster than in
$\Omega$(2^n) time (non-null transitions). This result, together with the time
complexity analysis of an already known space optimal protocol, shows that it
is also optimal in time (given the optimal space constrains).

is justified using simulations and measurements with the gas pixel detector

band, this new algorithm shows limited improvement for the sensitivity of GPD
polarimeters, but it may have a larger potential for low-pressure TPC
polarimeters.

the renormalization scales order-by-order for any perturbative QCD process. The
resulting predictions are independent of the choice of renormalization scheme,
a requirement of renormalization group invariance. The Crewther relation, which
was originally derived for conformal theory, provides a remarkable connection
between two observables when the $\beta$ function vanishes. The ""Generalized
Crewther Relation"" relates these two observables for physical QCD with nonzero
$\beta$ function; specifically, it connects the non-singlet Adler function
($D^{\rm ns}$) to the Bjorken sum rule coefficient for polarized deep-inelastic
electron scattering ($C_{\rm Bjp}$) at leading twist. A scheme-dependent
$\Delta_{\rm CSB}$-term appears in the analysis in order to compensate for the
conformal symmetry breaking (CSB) terms from perturbative QCD. In conventional
analyses, this normally leads to unphysical dependence in both the choice of
the renormalization scheme and the choice of the initial scale at any finite
order. However, by applying PMC scale-setting, we can fix the scales of the QCD
coupling unambiguously at every order of pQCD. ...... Thus one obtains a new
generalized Crewther relation for QCD which connects two effective charges,
$\widehat{\alpha}_d(Q)= \sum_{i\geq1} \widehat{\alpha}^{i}_{g_1}(Q_i)$, at
their respective physical scales. This identity is independent of the choice of
the renormalization scheme at any finite order, and the dependence on the
choice of the initial scale is negligible. Similar scale-fixed commensurate
scale relations also connect other physical observables at their physical
momentum scales, thus providing convention-independent, fundamental precision
tests of QCD.

explicit results in the theory of prime numbers.
  First, the problem of primes in short intervals is considered. We prove that
there is a prime between consecutive cubes $n^3$ and $(n+1)^3$ for all $n \geq
\exp(\exp(33.3))$. To prove this, we first derive an explicit version of the
Riemann--von Mangoldt explicit formula. We then assume the Riemann hypothesis
and show that there will be a prime in the interval $(x-4/ \pi \sqrt{x} \log x,
x]$ for all $x > 2$. Moreover, we show that the constant $4/\pi$ can be reduced
to $(1+\epsilon)$ for all sufficiently large values of $x$.
  Using explicit results on primes in arithmetic progressions, we prove two new
results in additive number theory. First, we prove that every integer greater
than 2 can be written as the sum of a prime and a square-free number. We then
work similarly to prove that every integer greater than 10 and not congruent to
$1$ modulo $4$ can be written as the sum of the square of a prime and a
square-free number.
  Finally, we provide new explicit results on an arcane inequality of
Ramanujan.

transport along several parallel cytoskeletal filaments and support many
biological processes. Experimental evidences suggest that they interact with
the nearest molecules of their filament while performing mechanical work. To
understand such mechanism theoretically, a new version of two-channel totally
asymmetric simple exclusion process which incorporates interactions in a
thermodynamically consistent way, is introduced. As the existing approaches for
multi-channel systems deviate from analyzing the effect of inter and intra
channel interactions, a new approach known as modified vertical cluster mean
field is developed. The approach along with monte-carlo simulations
successfully encounters some correlations and computes all complex dynamic
properties of the system. Role of symmetry of interactions and inter-channel
coupling is observed on triple points and particle maximal current.
Surprisingly, for each coupling rate and most of the interaction splittings,
there corresponds an optimal interaction strength for the maximal current which
belongs to the case of weak repulsive interactions. Moreover, for a fixed
interaction splitting, as coupling rate increases, the optimal strength
decreases and tends towards the experimental predictions. Correlations are
found to be short-range and weaker for repulsive and weak attractive
interactions, while for stronger attractions they are long-range and stronger.
All these findings are also discussed in the context of experimental
observations.

experiments enriched with evaluation results at (batch-)sequentially determined

set, which control false positives while minimizing false negatives. We
introduce adaptive strategies that sequentially select new evaluations of the
function by reducing the uncertainty on conservative estimates. Following the
Stepwise Uncertainty Reduction approach we obtain new evaluations by minimizing
adapted criteria. Tractable formulae for the conservative criteria are derived,
which allow more convenient optimization. The method is benchmarked on random

NGC6164. Interestingly, the parts of the nebula located further from HD148937
appear more enriched in stellar material than the part located closer to the
star. Evolutionary tracks suggest that these ejecta have occured $\sim$1.2-1.3
and $\sim$0.6 Myrs ago, respectively. In addition, we derive abundances of
argon for the nebula compatible with the solar values and we find a depletion
of neon and sulfur. The combined analyses of the known kinematics and of the
new abundances of the nebula suggest either a helical morphology for the
nebula, possibly linked to the magnetic geometry, or the occurrence of a binary
merger.

polyunsaturated lipids from free radicals. Although the interactions of
{\alpha}-toc with non-oxidized lipid bilayers have been studied, their on
oxidized bilayers remain unknown. In this study, atomistic molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations of oxidized lipid bilayers were performed with varying
concentrations of {\alpha}-toc. Bilayers with
1-palmitoyl-2-lauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PLPC) lipids and its
aldehyde derivatives at 1:1 ratio were studied. Our simulations show that
oxidized lipids self-assemble into aggregates with a water pore rapidly
developing across the lipid bilayer. The free energy of transporting an
{\alpha}-toc molecule in a lipid bilayer suggests that {\alpha}-tocs can
passively adsorb into the bilayer. When {\alpha}-toc molecules were present at
low concentrations in bilayers containing oxidized lipids, the formation of
water pores was slowed down. At high {\alpha}-toc concentra-tions, no pores
were observed. Based on the simulations, we propose that the mechanism of how
{\alpha}-toc inhibits pore formation in bilayers with oxidized lipids is the
follow-ing: {\alpha}-tocs trap the polar groups of the oxidized lipids at the
membrane-water interface resulting in a decreased probability for the oxidized
lipids to reach contact with the two leaflets and initiate pore formation. This
demon-strates that {\alpha}-toc molecules not only protect the bilayer from
oxidation but also help to stabilize the bilayer after lipid peroxidation
occurs. These results will help in de-signing more efficient molecules to
protect membranes from oxidative stress.

throughout color space. For example, we are far more precise when
discriminating two similar orange stimuli than two similar green stimuli. In
order for two colors to be perceived as different, the neurons representing
chromatic information must respond differently, and the difference must be
larger than the trial-to-trial variability of the response to each separate
color. Photoreceptors constitute the first stage in the processing of color
information; many more stages are required before humans can consciously report
whether two stimuli are perceived as chromatically distinguishable or not.
Therefore, although photoreceptor absorption curves are expected to influence
the accuracy of conscious discriminability, there is no reason to believe that
they should suffice to explain it. Here we develop information-theoretical
tools based on the Fisher metric that demonstrate that photoreceptor absorption
properties explain ~87% of the variance of human color discrimination ability,
as tested by previous behavioral experiments. In the context of this theory,
the bottleneck in chromatic information processing is determined by
photoreceptor absorption characteristics. Subsequent encoding stages modify
only marginally the chromatic discriminability at the photoreceptor level.

Cooper pairs with total angular momentum $J=0$ in the ground state. In addition
to the breaking of $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, separate spin or orbital rotation
symmetry is broken to the maximal sub-group, $SO(3)_S\times SO(3)_L\rightarrow
SO(3)_J$. The Fermions acquire mass, $m_F\equiv\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the
BCS gap. There are also 18 Bosonic excitations - 4 Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes
and 14 massive amplitude Higgs (AH) modes. The Bosonic modes are labelled by
the total angular momentum, $J\in\{0,1,2\}$, and parity under particle-hole
symmetry, $C=\pm 1$. For each pair of angular momentum quantum numbers,
$J,J_z$, there are two Bosonic partners with $C=\pm 1$. Based this spectrum
Nambu proposed a sum rule connecting the Fermion and Boson masses for BCS type
theories, which for $^3$He-B is $M_{J^+}^2 + M_{J^-}^2 = 4m_F^2$ for each
family of Bosonic modes labelled by $J$, where $M_{J^C}$ is the mass of the
Bosonic mode with quantum numbers $(J,C)$. Nambu's sum rule (NSR) has recently
been discussed in the context of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models for physics beyond
the standard model to speculate on possible partners to the recently discovered
Higgs Boson at higher energies. Here we point out that Nambu's Fermion-Boson
mass relations are not exact. Corrections to the Bosonic masses from (i)
leading order strong-coupling corrections to BCS theory, and (ii) polarization
of the parent Fermionic vacuum lead to violations of the sum-rule. Results for
these mass corrections are given in both the $T\rightarrow 0$ and $T\rightarrow
T_c$ limits. We also discuss experimental results, and theoretical analysis,
for the masses of the $J^{C}=2^{\pm}$ Higgs modes and the magnitude of the

certain class of Gaussian noises with self-similar and stationary properties,
which includes the fractional Gaussian noise, under high frequency
observations. In this setting, the optimal rate of estimation depends on
whether either the Hurst or diffusion parameters is known or not. This is due
to the singularity of the asymptotic Fisher information matrix for simultaneous
estimation of the above two parameters. One of our key ideas is to extend the
Whittle estimation method to the situation of high frequency observations. We
show that our estimators are asymptotically efficient in Fisher's sense.

limit in their interior, which leads to dilute extended envelopes. We perform a
comparative study of the envelope properties of massive stars at different
metallicities, with the aim to establish the impact of the stellar metallicity
on the effect of envelope inflation. We analyse published grids of
core-hydrogen burning massive star models computed with metallicities
appropriate for massive stars in the Milky Way, the LMC and the SMC, the very
metal poor dwarf galaxy I Zwicky 18, and for metal-free chemical composition.
Stellar models of all the investigated metallicities reach and exceed the
Eddington limit in their interior, aided by the opacity peaks of iron, helium
and hydrogen, and consequently develop inflated envelopes. Envelope inflation
leads to a redward bending of the zero-age main sequence and a broadening of
the main sequence band in the upper part of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We
derive the limiting L/M-values as function of the stellar surface temperature
above which inflation occurs, and find them to be larger for lower metallicity.
While Galactic models show inflation above ~29 Msun, the corresponding mass
limit for Population III stars is ~150 Msun. While the masses of the inflated
envelopes are generally small, we find that they can reach 1-100 Msun in models
with effective temperatures below ~8000 K, with higher masses reached by models
of lower metallicity. Envelope inflation is expected to occur in sufficiently
massive stars at all metallicities, and is expected to lead to rapidly growing
pulsations, high macroturbulent velocities, and might well be related to the
unexplained variability observed in Luminous Blue Variables like S Doradus and
Eta Carina.

the Heisenberg model, with orientation-independent interactions between the
spins. However, the applicability of such a model is not fully justified for TM
oxides because spin polarization of oxygen is usually ignored. In the
conventional model based on the Anderson principle, oxygen effects are
considered as a property of the TM ion and only TM interactions are relevant.
Here, we perform a systematic comparison between two approaches for spin
polarization on oxygen in typical TM oxides. To this end, we calculate the
exchange interactions in NiO, MnO, and hematite (Fe2O3) for different magnetic
configurations using the magnetic force theorem. We consider the full spin
Hamiltonian including oxygen sites, and also derive an effective model where
the spin polarization on oxygen renormalizes the exchange interactions between
TM sites. Surprisingly, the exchange interactions in NiO depend on the magnetic
state if spin polarization on oxygen is neglected, resulting in non-Heisenberg
behavior. In contrast, the inclusion of spin polarization in NiO makes the
Heisenberg model more applicable. Just the opposite, MnO behaves as a
Heisenberg magnet when oxygen spin polarization is neglected, but shows strong
non-Heisenberg effects when spin polarization on oxygen is included. In
hematite, both models result in non-Heisenberg behavior. General applicability
of the magnetic force theorem as well as the Heisenberg model to TM oxides is
discussed.

30% compared to conventional SVR in synthetic experiments. Furthermore, we have
evaluated our method qualitatively and quantitatively on real fetal MRI data

Simulation Technique (MCST), a number of randomly generated input data of the
FE model(s) are obtained based on the normal standard deviations of the
respective input parameters. Then a series of FE simulations are done and the
output kinematics and peak contact pressures are obtained for the respective FE
models (passive flexion and/or active flexion models). Seven output performance
measures are reported for the passive flexion model and one more parameter was
reported for the active flexion FE model (patello-femoral peak contact
pressure) in [1]. A sensitivity study will be performed based on the Response
Surface Method (RSM) to identify the key parameters that influence the
kinematics and peak contact pressures of the passive flexion FE model. Another
two MCST and RSM-based probabilistic FE analyses will be performed based on a
reduced list of 19 key input parameters. In total 4 probabilistic FE analyses
will be performed: 2 probabilistic FE analyses (MCST and RSM) based on an
extended set of 78 input variables and another 2 probabilistic FE analyses
(MCST and RSM) based on a reduced set of 19 input variables. Due to the likely
computation cost in order to make hundreds of FE simulations with MCST, a
high-performance and distributed computing system will be used for the passive
flexion FE model the same as it was used for the active flexion FE model in

momentum loss causes especially CVs with low-mass WDs to merge and form single

evolution and from binary star mergers taking into account these new merging
CVs. We show that according to the revised model of CV evolution, merging CVs
might be the dominant channel leading to the formation of low-mass single WDs

can be interpreted as further evidence for the revised model of CV evolution we
recently suggested. This model includes consequential angular momentum loss
that increases with decreasing WD mass and might not only explain the absence
of low-mass WD primaries in CVs but also the existence of single low-mass WDs.

compiling an inventory of oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules toward the
solar-type Class 0 protostellar binary IRAS16293-2422 from an unbiased spectral
survey with ALMA (PILS). Here we focus on the new detections of ethylene oxide
(c-C$_2$H$_4$O), acetone (CH$_3$COCH$_3$), and propanal (C$_2$H$_5$CHO).
Methods. With ALMA, we surveyed the spectral range from 329 to 363 GHz at
0.5$""$ (60 AU diameter) resolution. Using a simple model for the molecular
emission in LTE, the excitation temperatures and column densities of each
species were constrained. Results. We successfully detect propanal (44 lines),
ethylene oxide (20 lines) and acetone (186 lines) toward one component of the
protostellar binary, IRAS16293B. The high resolution maps demonstrate that the
emission for all investigated species originates from the compact central
region close to the protostar. This, along with a derived common excitation
temperature of $\sim$ 125 K, is consistent with a coexistence of these
molecules in the same gas. Conclusions. The observations mark the first
detections of acetone, propanal and ethylene oxide toward a low-mass protostar.
The relative abundance ratios of the two sets of isomers
(CH$_3$COCH$_3$/C$_2$H$_5$CHO $\sim$ 8 and CH$_3$CHO/c-C$_2$H$_4$O $\sim$ 12)
are comparable to previous observations toward high-mass protostars. The
majority of observed abundance ratios from these results as well as those
measured toward high-mass protostars are up to an order of magnitude above the
predictions from chemical models. This may reflect either missing reactions or
uncertain rates in the chemical networks. The physical conditions, such as
temperatures or densities, used in the models, may not be applicable to

of a complex cosolute. Here we investigate the case of a cosolute made by
self-assembling patchy particles. Depending on the valence, these particles can
form either polymer chains or branched structures. We numerically calculate the
effective potential $V_{eff}$ between two colloids immersed in a suspension of
reversible patchy particles, exploring a wide region of the cosolute phase
diagram and the role of valence. In addition to well-known excluded volume and
depletion effects, we find that, under appropriate conditions, $V_{eff}$ is
completely attractive but shows an oscillatory character. In the case of
polymerizing cosolute, this results from the fact that chains are efficiently
confined by the colloids through the onset of local order. This argument is
then generalized to the case of particles with higher valence, under the
condition that they are still able to maintain a fully bonded organization upon
confinement. The resulting effective potentials are relevant for understanding

microstructure emission from millisecond pulsars (MSPs), from Giant Metrewave
Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations of two MSPs at 325 and 610 MHz. Similar to
the characteristics of microstructure observed in normal period pulsars, we
find that these features are often highly polarized, and exhibit quasi-periodic
behavior on top of broader subpulse emission, with periods of the order of a
few $\mu$s. By measuring their widths and periodicities from single pulse
intensity profiles and their autocorrelation functions, we extend the
microstructure timescale - rotation period relationship by more than an order
of magnitude down to rotation periods $\sim$ 5 ms, and find it to be consistent
with the relationship derived earlier for normal pulsars. The similarity of
behavior is remarkable, given the significantly different physical properties
of MSPs and normal period pulsars, and rules out several previous speculations
about the possible different characteristics of microstructure in MSP radio
emission. We discuss the possible reasons for the non-detection of these
features in previous high time resolution MSP studies along with the physical
implications of our results, both in terms of a geometric beam sweeping model
and temporal modulation model for micropulse production.

connection to hypothesis testing. First, a general construction principle for
strictly locally proper weighted scoring rules based on conditional densities
and scoring rules for probability forecasts is proposed. We show how
likelihood-based weighted scoring rules from the literature fit into this
framework, and also introduce a weighted version of the Hyv\""arinen score,
which is a local scoring rule in the sense that it only depends on the forecast
density and its derivatives at the observation, and does not require evaluation
of integrals. Further, we discuss the relation to hypothesis testing. Using a
weighted scoring rule introduces a censoring mechanism, in which the form of
the density is irrelevant outside the region of interest. For the resulting
testing problem with composite null - and alternative hypotheses, we construct
optimal tests, and identify the associated weighted scoring rule. As a
practical consequence, using a weighted scoring rule allows to decide in favor
of a forecast which is superior to a competing forecast on a region of
interest, even though it may be inferior outside this region. A simulation
study and an application to financial time-series data illustrate these
findings.

elliptical mirrors located halfway between two common focal points M and M'. It
images cold neutrons from a diverging beam or a source with finite size at M by
single reflections onto a spot of similar size at M'. Direct view onto the
neutron source is blocked by a central absorber with little impact on the
transported solid angle. Geometric neutron losses due to source size can be
kept small using modern supermirrors and distances M-M' of a few tens of
metres. Very short flat mirrors can be used in practical implementations.
Transport with a minimum of reflections remedies losses due to multiple
reflections that are common in long elliptical neutron guides. Moreover,
well-defined reflection angles lead to new possibilities for enhancing the
spectral quality of primary beams, such as clear-cut discrimination of short
neutron wavelengths or beam monochromation using bandpass supermirrors.
Multi-mirror imaging systems may thus complement or even replace ordinary

the most plausible wave functions for the 5/2 state, there are a number of
alternatives with either Abelian or non-Abelian statistics. Recent experiments
suggest that the tunneling exponents are more consistent with an Abelian state
rather than a non-Abelian state. Here, we present edge-current-tunneling
experiments in geometrically confined quantum point contacts, which indicate
that Abelian and non-Abelian states compete at filling factor 5/2. Our results
are consistent with a transition from an Abelian state to a non-Abelian state

consider different spin configurations, aligned or antialigned to the orbital
angular momentum, for equal and unequal mass BNS and for two equations of
state. All the simulations employ quasiequilibrium circular initial data in the
constant rotational velocity approach, i.e. they are consistent with Einstein
equations and in hydrodynamical equilibrium. We study the NS rotation effect on
the energetics, the gravitational waves (GWs) and on the possible
electromagnetic (EM) emission associated to dynamical mass ejecta. For
dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\chi\sim0.1$ we find that spin-orbit
interactions and also spin-induced-quadrupole deformations affect the
late-inspiral-merger dynamics. The latter is, however, dominated by finite-size
effects. Spin (tidal) effects contribute to GW phase differences up to 5 (20)
radians accumulated during the last eight orbits to merger. Similarly, after
merger the collapse time of the remnant and the GW spectrogram are affected by
the NSs rotation. Spin effects in dynamical ejecta are clearly observed in
unequal mass systems in which mass ejection originates from the tidal tail of
the companion. Consequently kilonovae and other EM counterparts are affected by
spins. We find that spin aligned to the orbital angular momentum leads to
brighter EM counterparts than antialigned spin with luminosities up to a factor
of two higher.

background for a quantum chromodynamics (QCD) system with $N_f=2$ (two quark
flavors), we apply the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model by
introducing a chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$ artificially. The final
numerical results indicate that the introduced chiral chemical potential does
not change the critical exponents but shifts the location of critical end point
(CEP) significantly; the ratios for the chiral chemical potentials and
temperatures at CEP, $\mu_c/\mu_{5c}$ and $T_c/T_{5c}$, are significantly
affected by the system size $R$. The behavior is that $T_c$ increases slowly
with $\mu_5$ when $R$ is large and $T_c$ decreases first and then increases
with $\mu_5$ when $R$ is small. It is also found that for a fixed $\mu_5$,
there is a $R_{\text{min}}$, where the critical end point vanishes, and the
whole phase diagram becomes a crossover when $R<R_{\text{min}}$. Therefore, we
suggest that for the heavy-ion collision experiments, which is to study the
possible location of CEP, the finite-volume behavior should be taken into

question of whether approximation algorithms with better guarantees exist for

algorithm whose guarantee tends to $1 + \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 1.8660254,$ for the

recently seen increased popularity due to their simplicity, potential

result in memory instruction reordering, thus causing extra program behaviors
that are often not intended by the programmers. We propose a novel formal model
that captures the semantics of programs running under such protocols, and
features a set of fences that interact with the coherence layer. Using the
model, we design an algorithm to analyze the reachability and check whether a
program satisfies a given safety property with the current set of fences. We
describe a method for insertion of optimal sets of fences that ensure
correctness of the program under such protocols. The method relies on a
counter-example guided fence insertion procedure. One feature of our method is
that it can handle a variety of fences (with different costs). This diversity
makes optimization more difficult since one has to optimize the total cost of
the inserted fences, rather than just their number. To demonstrate the strength
of our approach, we have implemented a prototype and run it on a wide range of
examples and benchmarks. We have also, using simulation, evaluated the
performance of the resulting fenced programs.

being gQ=k0T with k0=pi^2*2kB^2/3h (T - temperature, kB - Boltzmann's constant,
h - Planck's constant), is an important fundamental constant. While the
quantization of the electrical conductance of 1D ballistic conductors has long
been experimentally established, a demonstration of the quantization of thermal
conductance proved to be much harder. It has already been accomplished for
weakly interacting systems of phonons, photons, and electronic Fermi-liquids.
Theoretically, however, the quantization must also hold in strongly interacting
systems, such as the Fractional Quantum Hall effect (FQHE), where electrons
fractionalize into anyons and chargeless quasiparticles such as neutral
Majorana fermions. Since the bulk in the FQHE is incompressible, it is not
expected to contribute significantly to the heat conductance, which is
determined by chiral 1D edge modes. The thermal conductance reflects
topological properties of the FQH electronic systems to which the electrical
conductance gives no access. Here, we present results of extensive measurements
of the heat conductance in 'particle-like' (Laughlin's) and 'hole-like'
fractional states. We verify the universal value of the quantum of thermal
conductance of the charged fractional modes as well as for chargeless neutral
modes. We also prove the validity of the theoretical predictions for the more
complex (and less studied) 'hole-like' states. Heat transport measurements open
a door to ample information, not easily accessible by conductance measurements.

We perform tri-dimensional simulations using the Cartesian AMR code RAMSES of
an accretion disc subject to infalling material. For the aspect ratio of $H/R
\simeq 0.15$ and disk mass $M_d \simeq 10^{-2}$ M$_\odot$ used in our study, we
find that for typical accretion rates on the order of a few 10$^{-7}$ M$_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$, values of the $\alpha$ parameter as high as a few 10$^{-3}$ are
inferred. The mass that is accreted in the inner part of the disc is typically
at least $50\%$ of the total mass that has been accreted onto the disc. Our
results suggest that external accretion of gas at moderate values, onto
circumstellar discs may trigger prominent spiral arms, reminiscent of recent
observations made with various instruments, and lead to significant transport
through the disc. If confirmed from observational studies, such accretion may
therefore influence disc evolution.

to explore evolution of energetic particle distribution in SNRs. Our spectral
fitting shows that 1) the particle distribution becomes harder with aging of
these SNRs, implying a continuous acceleration process, and the particle
distributions of CTB 37A and CTB 37B in the GeV range are harder than the
hardest distribution that can be produced at a shock via the linear diffusive
shock particle acceleration process, so spatial transport may play a role; 2)
the energy loss timescale of electrons at the high-energy cutoff due to
synchrotron radiation appears to be always a bit (within a factor of a few)
shorter than the age of the corresponding remnant, which also requires
continuous particle acceleration; 3) double power-law distributions are needed
to fit the spectra of CTB 37B and CTB 37A, which may be attributed to shock

classification accuracy became $81.8\%\pm 9.4\%$. These features were applied
for designing a state machine for online apnea event detection. Two
event-by-event accuracy indices, S and I, were proposed for evaluating the
performance {of the state machine. For the same database, the} S index was
$84.01\%\pm 9.06\%$, and the I index was $77.21\%\pm 19.01\%$. The results
indicate the considerable potential of applying the proposed algorithm to
clinical examinations for both screening and homecare purposes.

to the question about representation of the concept of time as a symbol which
can reflect the bases of the modern natural sciences, social sciences and
humanities. The main methods, which the author of this article uses, are
speculative analysis and modeling. The symbolic meaning of the concept of time
demonstrates preconditions for the organization of the bases of the natural
sciences, and social and humanitarian knowledge as well. Judgments for the
meaning of time reveal the essence of the problem in two aspects of discussion
on the dissociation of the foundations in the modern philosophy of physics and
the philosophical analysis of the humanities as well. 1) The formation of the
image of human nature in contemporary philosophy reveals the special role of
the concept of time in epistemology and philosophy of science. 2) This research
reveals the perspective of understanding natural and cultural processes, which
is based on the unification of branches of science. As a result, the research
shows the basics of communication of the natural sciences with the social
science, and humanitarian knowledge as well. This way, the problem of whether
time is a natural process or it is only a human invention can be solved. In
general, time is not exhausted by the meaning of either of the understandings,
and acts as one of the artificial measures people apply. In the same way, the
solution of another problem is reached: the modern discrepancy between separate
bases of science decreases considerably, if not disappears completely.

perform a parametric study on the process of extraction of lubricants from
heavy petroleum cuts. To train the model, we used field data collected from an
industrial plant. Operational conditions of feed and solvent flow rate,
Temperature of streams and mixing rate were considered as the input to the
model, whereas the flow rate of the main product was considered as the output
of the ANN model. A feed-forward Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network was
successfully applied to capture the relationship between inputs and output
parameters.

is crucial for effective planning. In this paper, we focus on providing an
intelligent and efficient solution that will help in forecasting revenue using
machine learning algorithms. We experiment with three different revenue
forecasting models, and here we provide detailed insights into the methodology
and their relative performance measured on real finance data. As a real-world
application of our models, we partner with Microsoft's Finance organization
