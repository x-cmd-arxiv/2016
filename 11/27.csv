that is inspired by a two particle interacting QW. The noise is introduced by a
random change in the value of the phase during the evolution, from a constant
probability distribution within a given interval. The consequences of
introducing such kind of noise depend on both the center value and the width of
that interval: a wider interval manifests as a higher level of noise. For some
range of parameters, one obtains a quasi-localized state, with a diffusive
speed that can be controlled by varying the parameters of the noise. The
existence of this (approximately) localized state for such kind of
time-dependent noise is, to the best of our knowledge, totally new, since
localization (i.e., Anderson localization) is linked in the literature to a
spatial random noise.

space-time point pattern. So, with either a nonhomogeneous Poisson process or
with a more general Cox process, we need to specify a space-time intensity. For
the latter, we need a \emph{random} intensity which we model as a realization
of a spatio-temporal log Gaussian process. Importantly, we view time as
circular not linear, necessitating valid separable and nonseparable covariance
functions over a bounded spatial region crossed with circular time. In
addition, crimes are classified by crime type. Furthermore, each crime event is
recorded by day of the year which we convert to day of the week marks.
  The contribution here is to develop models to accommodate such data. Our
specifications take the form of hierarchical models which we fit within a
Bayesian framework. In this regard, we consider model comparison between the
nonhomogeneous Poisson process and the log Gaussian Cox process. We also
compare separable vs. nonseparable covariance specifications.
  Our motivating dataset is a collection of crime events for the city of San
Francisco during the year 2012. We have location, hour, day of the year, and
crime type for each event. We investigate models to enhance our understanding
of the set of incidences.

able to prove that our nonlocal model reduces to the conventional class of
local hyperbolic conservation laws. Furthermore, we propose a numerical
discretization method adapted to our nonlocal model, which relies on a monotone
numerical flux and a uniform mesh, and we establish that these numerical
solutions converge to a solution, providing as by-product both the existence
theory for the nonlocal model and the convergence property relating the
nonlocal regime and the asymptotic local regime.

(WSNs) with wireless power transfer is proposed in this paper to balance the
energy at each sensor node and increase the total energy utilization ratio of
the whole WSNs. Considering the unbalanced spatio-temporal properties of the
energy supply across the deployment terrain of energy harvesting WSNs and the
dynamic traffic load at each sensor node, the energy cooperation problem among
sensor nodes is decomposed into two steps: the local energy storage at each
sensor node based on its traffic load to meet its own needs; within the energy
storage procedure sensor nodes with excess energy transmit a part of their
energy to nodes with energy shortage through the energy trading. Inventory
theory and game theory are respectively applied to solving the local energy
storage problem at each sensor node and the energy trading problem among
multiple sensor nodes. Numerical results show that compared with the static
energy cooperation method without energy trading, the Stackelberg Model based
Game we design in this paper can significantly improve the trading volume of
energy thereby increasing the utilization ratio of the harvested energy which
is unevenly distributed in the WSNs.

space weathering processes are responsible for the spectral mismatch between
S-type bodies and OCs. Furthermore, both telescopic observations and the first

ensemble of wind profiles flowing along open magnetic field-lines which sample
the whole three-dimensional atmosphere or, alternatively, on a given region of
interest. The radial domain starts from the photosphere and extends, typically,
to about 30 $R_{sun}$ . The elementary uni-dimensional wind solutions are based
on a mature numerical scheme which was adapted in order to accept any flux-tube
geometry. We discuss here the first results obtained with this model. We use
Potential Field Source-Surface (PFSS) extrapolations of magnetograms from the
Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO) to determine the structure of the background
magnetic field. Our results support the hypothesis that the geometry of the
magnetic flux-tubes in the lower corona controls the distribution of slow and
fast wind flows. The inverse correlation between density and speed faraway from
the Sun is a global effect resulting from small readjustments of the flux-tube
cross-sections in the high corona (necessary to achieve global pressure balance
and a uniform open flux distribution). In comparison to current global MHD
models, MULTI-VP performs much faster and does not suffer from spurious
cross-field diffusion effects. We show that MULTI-VP has the capability to
predict correctly the dynamical and thermal properties of the background solar

discussed. In particular, the possibility that the slight bump in the
integrated continuum of this remnant around 20 -- 70~GHz is genuine and that
can be explained by the contribution of additional emission mechanism such as
of spinning dust is emphasized. We find that adding a spinning dust component

for a slowly-varying leakage (mean opacity). For a more complex light curve

mental function to achieve goals. Mental switching is accompanied by transient
changes in brain activity, which must occur atop an anatomical architecture
that bridges disparate cortical and subcortical regions by underlying white
matter tracts. However, an integrated perspective regarding how white matter
networks might constrain brain dynamics during cognitive processes requiring
flexibility has remained elusive. To address this challenge, we applied
emerging tools from graph signal processing to decompose BOLD signals based on
diffusion imaging tractography in 28 individuals performing a perceptual task
that probed cognitive flexibility. We found that the alignment between
functional signals and the architecture of the underlying white matter network
was associated with greater cognitive flexibility across subjects. Signals with
behaviorally-relevant alignment were concentrated in the basal ganglia and
anterior cingulate cortex, consistent with cortico-striatal mechanisms of
cognitive flexibility. Importantly, these findings are not accessible to
unimodal analyses of functional or anatomical neuroimaging alone. Instead, by
taking a generalizable and concise reduction of multimodal neuroimaging data,
we uncover an integrated structure-function driver of human behavior.

attractive feature of the proposed framework is that it works with with any
weak formulation for the advection-diffusion equations, including single-field
formulations, which are computationally attractive. A particular emphasis is
placed on the parallel and algorithmic performance of the VI approach across
large-scale and heterogeneous problems. It is also shown that QP and VI are
equivalent under certain conditions. State-of-the-art QP and VI solvers
available from the PETSc library are used on a variety of steady-state 2D and
3D benchmarks, and a comparative study on the scalability between the QP and VI
solvers is presented. We then extend the proposed framework to transient
problems by simulating the miscible displacement of fluids in a heterogeneous
porous medium and illustrate the importance of enforcing maximum principles for
these types of coupled problems. Our numerical experiments indicate that VIs
are indeed a viable approach for enforcing the maximum principles and the
non-negative constraint in a large-scale computing environment. Also provided
are Firedrake project files as well as a discussion on the computer

importance to understand how and why data assimilation methods can be effective
when used with a fixed small number of particles, since for many large-scale
applications it is not practical to deploy algorithms close to the large
particle limit asymptotic. In this paper we address this question for particle
filters and, in particular, study their accuracy (in the small noise limit) and
ergodicity (for noisy signal and observation) without appealing to the large
particle number limit. We first overview the accuracy and minorization
properties for the true filtering distribution, working in the setting of
conditional Gaussianity for the dynamics-observation model. We then show that
these properties are inherited by optimal particle filters for any fixed number
of particles, and use the minorization to establish ergodicity of the filters.
For completeness we also prove large particle number consistency results for
the optimal particle filters, by writing the update equations for the
underlying distributions as recursions. In addition to looking at the optimal
particle filter with standard resampling, we derive all the above results for
(what we term) the Gaussianized optimal particle filter and show that the
theoretical properties are favorable for this method, when compared to the
standard optimal particle filter.

in the process find that this formulation 1) generalizes the ROS navigation

disturbances arise and 3) enables the integration of an onboard operator

local (e.g., joystick) level. Importantly, the integrated planning formulation

highlights failure modes of the ROS navigation stack (and thus for standard

However, it may be the case that some or any of the agents cannot distinguish
between two or more of the possible states based only on their private
observations, as when several states result in the same distribution of the
private signals. In our model, the agents form some initial belief (probability
distribution) about the unknown state and then refine their beliefs in
accordance with their private observations, as well as the beliefs of their
neighbors. An agent learns the unknown state when her belief converges to a
point mass that is concentrated at the true state. A rational agent would use
the Bayes' rule to incorporate her neighbors' beliefs and own private signals
over time. While such repeated applications of the Bayes' rule in networks can
become computationally intractable, in this paper, we show that in the
canonical cases of directed star, circle or path networks and their
combinations, one can derive a class of memoryless update rules that replicate
that of a single Bayesian agent but replace the self beliefs with the beliefs
of the neighbors. This way, one can realize an exponentially fast rate of
learning similar to the case of Bayesian (fully rational) agents. The proposed
rules are a special case of the Learning without Recall.

they play a crucial role in breeding newly-formed stars.
  Aims. With the aim of further understanding the dynamics, chemistry, and
evolution of IRDCs, we carried out multi-wavelength observations on a small
sample.
  Methods. We performed new observations with the IRAM 30 m and CSO 10.4 m
telescopes, with tracers ${\rm HCO^+}$, HCN, ${\rm N_2H^+}$, ${\rm C^{18}O}$,
DCO$^+$, SiO, and DCN toward six IRDCs G031.97+00.07, G033.69-00.01,
G034.43+00.24, G035.39-00.33, G038.95-00.47, and G053.11+00.05.
  Results. We investigated 44 cores including 37 cores reported in previous
work and seven newly-identified cores. Toward the dense cores, we detected 6
DCO$^+$, and 5 DCN lines. Using pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution
(SED) fits of the $\textit{Herschel}$ 70 to 500 $\mu$m, we obtained dust
temperature and column density distributions of the IRDCs. We found that ${\rm
N_2H^+}$ emission has a strong correlation with the dust temperature and column
density distributions, while ${\rm C^{18}O}$ showed the weakest correlation. It
is suggested that ${\rm N_2H^+}$ is indeed a good tracer in very dense
conditions, but ${\rm C^{18}O}$ is an unreliable one, as it has a relatively
low critical density and is vulnerable to freezing-out onto the surface of cold
dust grains. The dynamics within IRDCs are active, with infall, outflow, and
collapse; the spectra are abundant especially in deuterium species.
  Conclusions. We observe many blueshifted and redshifted profiles,
respectively, with ${\rm HCO^+}$ and ${\rm C^{18}O}$ toward the same core. This
case can be well explained by model ""envelope expansion with core collapse
(EECC)"".

superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. Numerical simulations are
essential to pre-empt the experimentally observed multipacting conditions.
Readily available codes(e.g. FISHPACT, MULTIPACT,CST etc.) are widely used to
simulate the phenomenon of multipacting in such cases. Most of the contemporary
two dimensional (2D) codes are unable to detect multipacting in the elliptical
cavities because they use a simplistic secondary emission model, where a
constant value of emission kinetic energy of secondary electrons is assumed.
Some three-dimensional (3D) codes, which use a more realistic and sophisticated
secondary emission model (Furman model) by following a probability distribution
for the emission kinetic energy of secondary electrons, are able to correctly
predict the occurance of multipacting. These 3D softwares however require large
data handling and are slower than contemporary 2D codes. We have developed a 2D
code for the multipacting analysis for axisymmetric structures, which is based
on the Furman model. Since our code is 2D, it is faster than the 3D codes. This
makes it possible to perform an accurate multipacting analysis of multipacting
within a resaonalble computational time, thus achieving an accuracy as good as
in the case of 3D codes, but requiring significantly less computing time. We

tasks in quantum information theory. The main goal is to further refine
characterizations of the optimal rates for quantum source coding, state
redistribution, and measurement compression with quantum side information via
second order asymptotic expansions and strong converse theorems. The
dissertation consists of a mathematical and an information-theoretic part. In
the mathematical part, we focus on the $\alpha$-sandwiched R\'enyi divergence
($\alpha$-SRD). We first investigate the limit $\alpha\to 0$ to determine
whether this recovers the well-known $0$-R\'enyi relative divergence. We then
prove various new results for entropic quantities derived from the
$\alpha$-SRD, including dimension bounds and useful bounds in terms of the
fidelity between two quantum states. Furthermore, we derive a necessary and
sufficient algebraic condition for equality in the data processing inequality
(viz. monotonicity under quantum operations) for the $\alpha$-SRD, and give
applications to entropic bounds. In the information-theoretic part, we first
derive the second order asymptotics of visible quantum source coding using a
mixed source. For the achievability part, we develop universal quantum source
codes achieving a given second order rate for a memoryless source. As a
corollary of the main result, we obtain the second order asymptotics of quantum
source coding using a single memoryless source. We then prove strong converse
theorems for state redistribution (with or without feedback) and measurement
compression with quantum side information. The key ingredients in proving these
theorems are the aforementioned fidelity bounds on R\'enyi entropic quantities

maximizes the sum of flow values between every two terminals in an undirected

general, it is known that the flow value of an integral multiflow is bounded by
the cut value of a cut-system which consists of disjoint subsets each of which
contains exactly one terminal or has an odd cut value, and there exists a pair
of an integral multiflow and a cut-system whose flow value and cut value are
equal; i.e., a pair of a maximum integral multiflow and a minimum cut. In this
paper, we propose an $O(n)$-time algorithm that finds such a pair of an
integral multiflow and a cut-system in a given tree instance with $n$ vertices.
This improves the best previous results by a factor of $\Omega (n)$. Regarding
a given tree in an instance as a rooted tree, we define $O(n)$ rooted tree
instances taking each vertex as a root, and establish a recursive formula on
maximum integral multiflow values of these instances to design a dynamic
programming that computes the maximum integral multiflow values of all $O(n)$
rooted instances in linear time. We can prove that the algorithm implicitly
maintains a cut-system so that not only a maximum integral multiflow but also a
minimum cut-system can be constructed in linear time for any rooted instance

stationary observer in the Kerr spacetime, specifically, to distinguish naked
singularity (NS) from black hole (BH). It was shown recently that for gyros
attached to static observers, their precession frequency became arbitrarily
large in the limit of approach to the ergosurface. For gyros attached to
stationary observers that move with non-zero angular velocity $\Omega$, this
divergence at the ergosurface can be avoided. Specifically, for such gyros, the
precession frequencies diverge on the event horizon of a BH, but are finite and
regular for NS everywhere except at the singularity itself. Therefore a genuine
detection of the event horizon becomes possible in this case. We also show that
for a near-extremal NS ($1<a_* < 1.1$), characteristic features appear in the
radial profiles of the precession frequency, using which we can further
distinguish a near-extremal NS from a BH, or even from NS with larger angular
momentum. We then investigate the Lense-Thirring (LT) precession or nodal plane
precession frequency of the accretion disk around a BH and NS to show that
clear distinctions exist for these configurations in terms of radial variation
features. The LT precession in equatorial circular orbits increases with
approach to a BH, whereas for NS it increases, attains a peak and then
decreases. Interestingly, for $a_*=1.089$, it decreases until it vanishes at a
certain radius, and acquires negative values for $a_* > 1.089$ for a certain
range of $r$. For $1<a_*<1.089$, a peak appears, but the LT frequency remains
positive definite. There are important differences in accretion disk LT
frequencies for BH and NS and since LT frequencies are intimately related to
observed QPOs, these features might allow us to determine whether a given
rotating compact astrophysical object is BH or NS.

lines on $X$. We establish a relation between the Chow motives of $X$ and $F$.
This relation implies in particular that if $X$ has finite-dimensional motive
(in the sense of Kimura), then $F$ also has finite-dimensional motive. This
proves finite-dimensionality for motives of Fano varieties of cubics of
dimension $3$ and $5$, and of certain cubics in other dimensions.

channels of multiple users in densely populated indoor and outdoor scenarios.
For this purpose, a statistical millimeter wave (mmwave) MIMO channel simulator
is carefully designed using state of the art channel models. At the mmwave
frequencies, human/vehicular mobility around the mobile users may partially or
completely block the communication link. This give rise to the consideration of
new channel modeling parameter i.e. probability of a user to be in LOS
dynamics. Higher line of sight (LOS) probabilities may increase the spatial
correlation among the multiuser channels. Therefore, quantification of the
spatial separation of users in different scenarios with distinct LOS
probabilities is crucial and it is the subject of investigation of this paper.
Additionally, the mutual orthogonality of channels by changing the number of
base station (BS) antennas and inter antenna element distance (IED) have also
been investigated. Analysis shows that LOS blockage of certain scenario has
more impact at the degree of orthogonality among users as compared to the
number of BS antennas and the spacing between the antenna elements.

high practical relevance, for instance for the fabrication of elastic composite
materials. We theoretically analyze the following situation. Rigid spherical
inclusions are enclosed by a homogeneous elastic medium under stick boundary
conditions. Forces and torques are directly imposed from outside onto the
inclusions, or are externally induced between them. The inclusions respond to
these forces and torques by translations and rotations against the surrounding
elastic matrix. This leads to elastic matrix deformations, and in turn results
in mutual long-ranged matrix-mediated interactions between the inclusions.
Adapting a well-known approach from low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics, we
explicitly calculate the displacements and rotations of the inclusions from the
externally imposed or induced forces and torques. Analytical expressions are
presented as a function of the inclusion configuration in terms of
displaceability and rotateability matrices. The role of the elastic environment
is implicitly included in these relations. That is, the resulting expressions
allow a calculation of the induced displacements and rotations directly from
the inclusion configuration, without having to explicitly determine the
deformations of the elastic environment. In contrast to the hydrodynamic case,
compressibility of the surrounding medium is readily taken into account. We
present the complete derivation based on the underlying equations of linear
elasticity theory. In the future, the method will, for example, be helpful to
characterize the behavior of externally tunable elastic composite materials, to
accelerate numerical approaches, as well as to improve the quantitative
interpretation of microrheological results.

General Relativity such a world-line formalism is not quite straightforward
because of the strict impossibility to accommodate point masses and rigid
bodies. In many situations of practical interest it can still be made to work
using an effective hamiltonian or energy-momentum tensor for a finite number of
collective degrees of freedom of the compact object. Even so exact solutions of
the equations of motion are often not available. In such cases families of
world lines of compact bodies in curved space-times can be constructed by a

delayed feedback. Moreover, this kind of feedback is applied to design a

whether and, if so, why they handle requirements labeled as FRs differently
from those labeled as QRs. We additionally asked for consequences of this
distinction w.r.t. the development process. Our results indicate that the
development process for requirements of the two classes strongly differs (e.g.,
in testing). We identified a number of reasons why practitioners do (or do not)
distinguish between QRs and FRs in their documentation and we analyzed both
problems and benefits that arise from that. We found, for instance, that many
reasons are based on expectations rather than on evidence. Those expectations
are, in fact, not reflected in specific negative or positive consequences per

also aware of the risks that this distinction bears so that they may take

arbitrary large bandwidths without increasing the peak rf-amplitude and by

defined as social networks whose nodes are the active institutions within the

The solution is able to provide a ranking of active institutions within their

for institutions based on their publications and encouraged the use of any
publicly available dataset such as the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG). The
contest was focused on research publications in selected conferences and asked
for a prediction of the ranking for active institutions within those
conferences in 2016. It should be noted that the results of the paper
submissions and therefore the ground truths for KDD Cup were unknown at the
time of the contest. Each team's final ranking list was evaluated by a metric
called NDCG@20 after the results were released. This metric was used to
indicate the distance between each team's proposed ranking and the actual one
once it was known. After computing the scores of institutions for each year
starting from 2011, we aggregated the rankings by summing the normalized scores
across the years and using the final score set to provide the final ranking.
Since the 2016 ground truths were unknown, we utilized the scores from
2011-2014 and used the 2015 publications as a test bed for evaluating our
aggregation method. Based on the testing, summing the normalized scores got us
closest to the actual 2015 rankings and using same heuristic for predicting the

particles do not interact and travel through a static potential energy
landscape. Here we show, using computer simulations, how these assumptions and
the resulting predictions from classical Eyring-type theories break down in
entropically-stabilised BCC crystals due to the thermal excitations of the
crystalline matrix. Deviations are particularly severe close to melting where
the lattice becomes weak and dopant dynamics exhibit strongly localised and
heterogeneous dynamics. We attribute these anomalies to the failure of both
assumptions underlying the classical description: i) the instantaneous
potential field experienced by dopants becomes largely disordered due to
thermal fluctuations and ii) elastic interactions cause strong dopant-dopant
interactions even at low doping fractions. These results illustrate how
describing non-classical dopant dynamics requires taking the effective
disordered potential energy landscape of strongly excited crystals and
dopant-dopant interactions into account.

Such problems are usually detected when patients or healthcare providers report

Internet search engines.
  We extracted queries from the USA to the Bing search engine which mentioned
one of 5,195 pharmaceutical drugs during 2015 and all recall notifications
issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during that year. By using
attributes that quantify the change in query volume at the state level, we
attempted to predict if a recall of a specific drug will be ordered by FDA in a
time horizon ranging from one to 40 days in future.
  Our results show that future drug recalls can indeed be identified with an
AUC of 0.791 and a lift at 5% of approximately 6 when predicting a recall will
occur one day ahead. This performance degrades as prediction is made for longer
periods ahead. The most indicative attributes for prediction are sudden spikes
in query volume about a specific medicine in each state. Recalls of
prescription drugs and those estimated to be of medium-risk are more likely to
be identified using search query data.
  These findings suggest that aggregated Internet search engine data can be
used to facilitate in early warning of faulty batches of medicines.

increases exponentially with $d_f$ (the degree of the resource nodes). Although
the codebooks are designed to have low density, the detection still takes
considerable time. The parameter $d_f$ must be designed to be very small, which
largely limits the choice of codebooks. In this paper, a new detection
algorithm is proposed by discretizing the probability distribution functions

codebook, the detection complexity of each resource node (function node) is
reduced from $O(d_f M^{d_f})$ to $O(d_f^3 \ln (d_f))$. Its detection accuracy
can quickly approach that of the previous detection algorithms with the
decrease of sampling interval in discretization.

  Cloud Computing Environment","6 pages,6 figures, Article published",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cloud computing is a new archetype that provides dynamic computing services
to cloud users through the support of datacenters that employs the services of
datacenter brokers which discover resources and assign them Virtually. The
focus of this research is to efficiently optimize resource allocation in the
cloud by exploiting the Max-Min scheduling algorithm and enhancing it to
increase efficiency in terms of completion time (makespan). This is key to
enhancing the performance of cloud scheduling and narrowing the performance gap
between cloud service providers and cloud resources consumers/users. The
current Max-Min algorithm selects tasks with maximum execution time on a faster
available machine or resource that is capable of giving minimum completion
time. The concern of this algorithm is to give priority to tasks with maximum
execution time first before assigning those with the minimum execution time for
the purpose of minimizing makespan. The drawback of this algorithm is that, the
execution of tasks with maximum execution time first may increase the makespan,
and leads to a delay in executing tasks with minimum execution time if the
number of tasks with maximum execution time exceeds that of tasks with minimum
execution time, hence the need to improve it to mitigate the delay in executing
tasks with minimum execution time. CloudSim is used to compare the
effectiveness of the improved Max-Min algorithm with the traditional one. The
experimented results show that the improved algorithm is efficient and can
produce better makespan than Max-Min and DataAware.

two specific models derived by Gaspard and Gilbert as mesoscopic dynamics of

They claim some equalities hold between the thermal conductivity and several
static observables and also conjecture that these equations are universal in
the sense that they hold for mesoscopic dynamics of energies for confined
particles interacting through hard-core collisions. In this paper, we give
sufficient and necessary conditions for these equalities to hold in the class

conductivity and other static observables holds if and only if the model obeys
the gradient condition. Since the gradient condition does not hold for models
derived by Gaspard and Gilbert, our result implies a part of their claim is
incorrect.

requirements by differentiating how the system shall do something in contrast
to what the system shall do. This distinction is not only prevalent in
research, but also influences how requirements are handled in practice. NFRs
are usually documented separately from functional requirements, without
quantitative measures, and with relatively vague descriptions. As a result,
they remain difficult to analyze and test. Several authors argue, however, that
many so-called NFRs actually describe behavioral properties and may be treated
the same way as functional requirements. In this paper, we empirically
investigate this point of view and aim to increase our understanding on the
nature of NFRs addressing system properties. We report on the classification of
530 NFRs extracted from 11 industrial requirements specifications and analyze
to which extent these NFRs describe system behavior. Our results suggest that
most ""non-functional"" requirements are not non-functional as they describe
behavior of a system. Consequently, we argue that many so-called NFRs can be
handled similarly to functional requirements.

challenging problem with many applications in human-computer interaction. In
contrast to previous work that has focused on individual instances as a search
target, we propose the first approach to predict categories and attributes of
search targets based on gaze data. However, state of the art models for
categorical recognition, in general, require large amounts of training data,
which is prohibitive for gaze data. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel Gaze Pooling Layer that integrates gaze information into CNN-based
architectures as an attention mechanism - incorporating both spatial and
temporal aspects of human gaze behavior. We show that our approach is effective
even when the gaze pooling layer is added to an already trained CNN, thus
eliminating the need for expensive joint data collection of visual and gaze
data. We propose an experimental setup and data set and demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for search target prediction based on gaze
behavior. We further study how to integrate temporal and spatial gaze
information most effectively, and indicate directions for future research in
the gaze-based prediction of mental states.

uncertainty still render the discipline difficult to investigate. This results
in a lack of empirical data. These are necessary, however, to demonstrate which
practically relevant RE problems exist and to what extent they matter.
Motivated by this situation, we initiated the Naming the Pain in Requirements
Engineering (NaPiRE) initiative which constitutes a globally distributed,
bi-yearly replicated family of surveys on the status quo and problems in
practical RE. In this article, we report on the qualitative analysis of data
obtained from 228 companies working in 10 countries in various domains and we
reveal which contemporary problems practitioners encounter. To this end, we
analyse 21 problems derived from the literature with respect to their relevance
and criticality in dependency to their context, and we complement this picture
with a cause-effect analysis showing the causes and effects surrounding the
most critical problems. Our results give us a better understanding of which
problems exist and how they manifest themselves in practical environments.
Thus, we provide a first step to ground contributions to RE on empirical
observations which, until now, were dominated by conventional wisdom only.

holes by analyzing the effects of thermal fluctuations on dumb holes, the
analogues for black holes. The proposal is based on the Jacobson formalism,
where the Einstein field equations are viewed as thermodynamical relations, and
so the quantum fluctuations are generated from the thermal fluctuations. It is
well known that all approaches to quantum gravity generate logarithmic
corrections to the entropy of a black hole and the coefficient of this term
varies according to the different approaches to the quantum gravity. It is
possible to demonstrate that such logarithmic terms are also generated from
thermal fluctuations in dumb holes. In this paper, we claim that it is possible
to experimentally test such corrections for dumb holes, and also obtain the
correct coefficient for them. This fact can then be used to predict the effects
of quantum fluctuations on realistic black holes, and so it can also be used,
in principle, to experimentally test the different approaches to quantum
gravity.
