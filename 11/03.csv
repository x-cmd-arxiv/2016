states for closed-shell systems within the in-medium similarity renormalization
group (IMSRG) framework. Both are based on combining the IMSRG with simple
many-body methods commonly used to target excited states, such as the
Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) and equations-of-motion (EOM) techniques. In
the first approach, a two-step sequential IMSRG transformation is used to drive
the Hamiltonian to a form where a simple TDA calculation (i.e., diagonalization
in the space of $1$p$1$h excitations) becomes exact for a subset of
eigenvalues. In the second approach, equations-of-motion (EOM) techniques are
applied to the ground-state-decoupled IMSRG Hamiltonian to access excited
states. We perform proof-of-principle calculations for parabolic quantum dots
in two-dimensions and the closed shell nuclei $^{16}$O and $^{22}$O. We find
that the TDA-IMSRG approach gives better accuracy than the EOM-IMSRG when
calculations converge, but is otherwise lacking the versatility and numerical
stability of the latter. Our calculated spectra are in reasonable agreement
with analogous EOM-coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) calculations, which paves the way
for more interesting applications of the EOM-IMSRG to calculations of
consistently evolved observables such as electromagnetic strength functions and
nuclear matrix elements, and extensions to nuclei within 1-2 nucleons of a
closed shell by generalizing the EOM ladder operator to include particle-number
nonconserving terms.

ranging from foundations of quantum field theory to computational recipes in
molecular dynamics. In light of this success it is remarkable that a
practicable quantitative understanding of what ""slowly enough"" means is limited
to a modest set of systems mostly having a small Hilbert space. Here we show
how this gap can be bridged for a broad natural class of physical systems,
namely many-body systems where a small move in the parameter space induces an
orthogonality catastrophe. In this class, the conditions for adiabaticity are
derived from the scaling properties of the parameter dependent ground state

major simplification of a complex problem, which otherwise requires solving
non-autonomous time evolution in a large Hilbert space. We illustrate our
general results by analyzing conditions for the transport quantization in a

In an ideal quantum computer (QC), a system of qubits evolves in time unitarily

otherwise intractable problems. In the real situation, a QC is subject to
decoherence and attenuation effects due to interaction with an environment and
with possible short-term random disturbances and gate deficiencies. The
stability of a QC under such attacks is a key issue for the development of
realistic devices. We assume that the influence of the environment can be
incorporated by a master equation that includes unitary evolution with gates,
supplemented by a Lindblad term. Lindblad operators of various types are
explored; namely, steady, pulsed, gate friction, and measurement operators. In
the master equation, we use the Lindblad term to describe short time intrusions
by random Lindblad pulses. The phenomenological master equation is then
extended to include a nonlinear Beretta term that describes the evolution of a
closed system with increasing entropy, plus a Bath environment term stipulated
by a fixed temperature. Here we explore the case of a simple one-qubit system
in preparation for generalization to multi-qubit, qutrit and hybrid
qubit-qutrit systems. This model master equation can be used to test the
stability of memory and the efficacy of quantum gates. The properties of such
hybrid master equations are explored, with emphasis on the role of thermal
equilibrium and entropy constraints.

decision making and differentiation in molecular networks. Experimental
evidences of phenotypic differentiation are given by the presence of bimodal
distributions of gene expression levels, where the modes of the distribution
often correspond to different physiological states of the system. We
theoretically address the presence of bimodal phenotypes in the context of
microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation. MiRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules
that downregulate the expression of their target mRNAs. The nature of this
interaction is titrative and induces a threshold effect: below a given target
transcription rate no mRNAs are free and available for translation. We
investigate the effect of extrinsic noise on the system by introducing a
fluctuating miRNA-transcription rate. We find that the presence of extrinsic
noise favours the presence of bimodal target distributions which can be
observed for a wider range of parameters compared to the case with intrinsic
noise only and for lower miRNA-target interaction strength. Our results suggest
that combining threshold-inducing interactions with extrinsic noise provides a
simple and robust mechanism for obtaining bimodal populations not requiring
fine tuning. We furthermore characterise the protein distributions dependence
on protein half-life.

identify patterns of interaction that contribute to integration into the
university. Using these measures, we analyze how position within a social
network in a Modeling Instruction (MI) course -- an introductory physics course

taking a subsequent physics course. Students with higher centrality at the end
of the first semester of MI are more likely to enroll in a second semester of
MI. Moreover, we found that chances of successfully predicting individual
student's persistence based on centrality measures are fairly high -- up to
$75\%$, making the centrality a good predictor of persistence. These findings
suggest that increasing student social integration may help in improving
persistence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.

entanglement carried by a quantum state as an optimal amount of the intrinsic
information that can be extracted from the state by measurement. We investigate
in detail the properties of a Gaussian version of IE, the so-called Gaussian
intrinsic entanglement (GIE). We show explicitly how GIE simplifies to the
mutual information of a distribution of outcomes of measurements on a
conditional state obtained by a measurement on a purifying subsystem of the
analyzed state, which is first minimized over all measurements on the purifying
subsystem and then maximized over all measurements on the conditional state. By
constructing for any separable Gaussian state a purification and a measurement
on the purifying subsystem which projects the purification onto a product
state, we prove that GIE vanishes on all Gaussian separable states. Via
realization of quantum operations by teleportation, we further show that GIE is
non-increasing under Gaussian local trace-preserving operations and classical
communication. For pure Gaussian states and a reduction of the
continuous-variable GHZ state, we calculate GIE analytically and we show that
it is always equal to the Gaussian R\'{e}nyi-2 entanglement. We also extend the
analysis of IE to a non-Gaussian case by deriving an analytical lower bound on
IE for a particular form of the non-Gaussian continuous-variable Werner state.
Our results indicate that mapping of entanglement onto intrinsic information is
capable of transmitting also quantitative properties of entanglement and that
this property can be used for introduction of a quantifier of Gaussian
entanglement which is a compromise between computable and physically meaningful
entanglement quantifiers.

relational query processing, exposing two distinctive gaps for query

accessible analytics over data streams having properties from different

transmit at the same time using the same channel, a co-channel interference is
experienced and hence the performance of the involved WBANs may be degraded. In
this paper, we exploit the 16 channels available in the 2.4 GHz international
band of ZIGBEE, and propose a distributed scheme that avoids interference
through predictable channel hopping based on Latin rectangles, namely, CHIM. In
the proposed CHIM scheme, each WBAN's coordinator picks a Latin rectangle whose
rows are ZIGBEE channels and columns are sensor IDs. Based on the Latin
rectangle of the individual WBAN, each sensor is allocated a backup time-slot
and a channel to use if it experiences interference such that collisions among
different transmissions of coexisting WBANs are minimized. We further present a
mathematical analysis that derives the collision probability of each sensor's
transmission in the network. In addition, the efficiency of CHIM in terms of
transmission delay and energy consumption minimization are validated by
simulations.

videos also depends on the social dynamics, i.e. the interaction of the content
creators (or channels) with YouTube users. Using real-world data consisting of
about 6 million videos spread over 25 thousand channels, we empirically examine

Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) networks. Given the popularity of LoRa it is likely
that multiple independent LoRa networks are deployed in close proximity. In
this situation, neighbouring networks interfere and methods have to be found to
combat this interference. In this paper we investigate the use of directional
antennae and the use of multiple base stations as methods of dealing with
inter-network interference. Directional antennae increase signal strength at
receivers without increasing transmission energy cost. Thus, the probability of
successfully decoding the message in an interference situation is improved.
Multiple base stations can alternatively be used to improve the probability of
receiving a message in a noisy environment. We compare the effectiveness of
these two approaches via simulation. Our findings show that both methods are
able to improve LoRa network performance in interference settings. However, the
results show that the use of multiple base stations clearly outperforms the use
of directional antennae. For example, in a setting where data is collected from
600 nodes which are interfered by four networks with 600 nodes each, using
three base stations improves the Data Extraction Rate (DER) from 0.24 to 0.56

This
system automatically derives worst-case resource bounds for higher-order
polymorphic programs with user-defined inductive types. The technique is
parametric in the resource and can derive bounds for time, memory allocations
and energy usage. The derived bounds are multivariate resource polynomials
which are functions of different size parameters that depend on the standard
OCaml types. Bound inference is fully automatic and reduced to a linear
optimization problem that is passed to an off-the-shelf LP solver. Technically,
the analysis system is based on a novel multivariate automatic amortized
resource analysis (AARA). It builds on existing work on linear AARA for
higher-order programs with user-defined inductive types and on multivariate
AARA for first-order programs with built-in lists and binary trees. For the
first time, it is possible to automatically derive polynomial bounds for
higher-order functions and polynomial bounds that depend on user-defined
inductive types. Moreover, the analysis handles programs with side effects and
even outperforms the linear bound inference of previous systems. At the same
time, it preserves the expressivity and efficiency of existing AARA techniques.
The practicality of the analysis system is demonstrated with an implementation
and integration with Inria's OCaml compiler. The implementation is used to
automatically derive resource bounds for 411 functions and 6018 lines of code
derived from OCaml libraries, the CompCert compiler, and implementations of
textbook algorithms. In a case study, the system infers bounds on the number of
queries that are sent by OCaml programs to DynamoDB, a commercial NoSQL cloud
database service.

the AR coronal helicity is positive while later on the field configuration is
close to a potential field. As theoretically expected, the magnetic helicity
cancelation is associated to enhanced coronal activity. The study suggests a
boundary driven transformation of the chirality in the global AR magnetic
structure. This may be the result of the emergence of a flux rope with positive
twist around its apex while it has negative twist in its legs. The origin of
such mixed helicity flux rope in the convective zone is challenging for models.

bulk viscosity will lead to an effective negative pressure near the critical
temperature, $T_{c}$ which in turn drives the Universe to inflate. This
inflation has a natural graceful exist when the viscous effect evanesce. We
estimate that, depending upon the peak value of $\zeta$, universe expands by a
factor of $10$ to $80$ times in a very short span ($\Delta t\sim 10^{-8}$
seconds). Another important outcome of the bulk viscosity dominated dynamics is
the cavitation of QGP around $T \sim 1.5T_{c}$. This would lead to the
phenomenon of formation of cavitation bubbles within the QGP phase. The above
scenario is independent of the order of QCD phase transition. We delineate some
of the important cosmological consequences of the inflation and the cavitation.

(SILs), and then all sensors belonging to these lists are allocated orthogonal
codes. Secondly, we propose a distributed time reference correlation scheme,
namely, DTRC, that is used as a building block of OCAIM. DTRC enables eachWBAN
to generate a virtual time-based pattern to relate the different superframes.
Accordingly, DTRC provides each WBAN with the knowledge about, 1) which
superframes and, 2) which time-slots of those superframes interfere with the
time-slots within its superframe. Thirdly, we further analyze the success and
collision probabilities of frames transmissions when the number of coexisting
WBANs grows. The simulation results demonstrate that OCAIM outperforms other
competing schemes in terms of interference mitigation and power savings.

costly radio frequency (RF) chains in massive multiple-input multiple-output

equipment (UE) or a single group of UEs, employing the frequency-flat
first-level analog beamforming (AB) that cannot be applied to multiple groups
of UEs served in different frequency resources in an orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system. In this paper, a novel HB
algorithm with unified AB based on the spatial covariance matrix (SCM)
knowledge of all UEs is proposed for a massive MIMO-OFDM system in order to
support multiple groups of UEs. The proposed HB method with a much smaller
number of RF chains can achieve more than 95% performance of full digital
beamforming. In addition, a novel practical subspace construction (SC)
algorithm based on partial channel state information is proposed to estimate
the required SCM. The proposed SC method can offer more than 97% performance of
the perfect SCM case. With the proposed methods, significant cost and power
savings can be achieved without large loss in performance. Furthermore, the
proposed methods can be applied to massive MIMO-OFDM systems in both
time-division duplex and frequency-division duplex.

unbiased estimators of the gradients of the expected loss. While many
continuous random variables have such reparameterizations, discrete random

discrete states. In this work we introduce Concrete random
variables---continuous relaxations of discrete random variables. The Concrete
distribution is a new family of distributions with closed form densities and a
simple reparameterization. Whenever a discrete stochastic node of a computation
graph can be refactored into a one-hot bit representation that is treated
continuously, Concrete stochastic nodes can be used with automatic
differentiation to produce low-variance biased gradients of objectives

the P$-$O bond, key in the formation of DNA. We have analyzed a spectral line

detection of the trans and gauche conformers of ethyl formate. A Local
Thermodynamic Equilibrium analysis indicates that the excitation temperature is
78$\pm$10 K and that the two conformers have similar source-averaged column
densities of (2.0$\pm$0.3)$\times$10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ and an abundance of
$\sim$10$^{-8}$. We compare the observed molecular abundances of ethyl formate
with different competing chemical models based on grain surface and gas-phase

the formation of ethyl formate (and other complex organic molecules) in hot
molecular cores, rather than reactions in the gas phase.

graph parameter. Unfortunately all known algorithms for computing, even
approximately, the girth and girth-related structures in directed weighted
$m$-edge and $n$-node graphs require $\Omega(\min\{n^{\omega}, mn\})$ time (for
$2\leq\omega<2.373$). In this paper, we drastically improve these runtimes as
follows:
  * Multiplicative Approximations in Nearly Linear Time: We give an algorithm
that in $\widetilde{O}(m)$ time computes an $\widetilde{O}(1)$-multiplicative
approximation of the girth as well as an $\widetilde{O}(1)$-multiplicative
roundtrip spanner with $\widetilde{O}(n)$ edges with high probability (w.h.p).
  * Nearly Tight Additive Approximations: For unweighted graphs and any $\alpha
\in (0,1)$ we give an algorithm that in $\widetilde{O}(mn^{1 - \alpha})$ time
computes an $O(n^\alpha)$-additive approximation of the girth w.h.p, and
partially derandomize it. We show that the runtime of our algorithm cannot be
significantly improved without a breakthrough in combinatorial Boolean matrix
multiplication.
  Our main technical contribution to achieve these results is the first nearly
linear time algorithm for computing roundtrip covers, a directed graph
decomposition concept key to previous roundtrip spanner constructions.
Previously it was not known how to compute these significantly faster than

cells were observed migrating on surfaces with topography (array of posts),
coated with adhesive molecules (fibronectin, FN) by Park et al., 2016. Several

oscillation between the cell front and back, and random dynamics. To gain

(1) Competition of lamellipodia for limited pools of GTPases. (2) Protrusion /

Fourier basis, with strictly uniform resolution at all points in space, it
suffers from substantial inefficiencies in calculations involving atoms with
localized states, such as first-row and transition-metal atoms, and requires
significant nonlocal communications, which limit parallel efficiency.
Real-space methods such as finite-differences and finite-elements have
partially addressed both resolution and parallel-communications issues but have
been plagued by one key disadvantage relative to PW: excessive number of
degrees of freedom needed to achieve the required accuracies. We present a
real-space partition of unity finite element (PUFE) method to solve the
Kohn-Sham equations of density functional theory. In the PUFE method, we build
the known atomic physics into the solution process using partition-of-unity
enrichment techniques in finite element analysis. The method developed herein
is completely general, applicable to metals and insulators alike, and
particularly efficient for deep, localized potentials, as occur in calculations
at extreme conditions of pressure and temperature. Full self-consistent
Kohn-Sham calculations are presented for LiH, involving light atoms, and CeAl,
involving heavy atoms with large numbers of atomic-orbital enrichments. We find
that the new PUFE approach attains the required accuracies with substantially
fewer degrees of freedom, typically by an order of magnitude or more, than the
PW method. We compute the equation of state of LiH and show that the computed
lattice constant and bulk modulus are in excellent agreement with reference PW
results, while requiring an order of magnitude fewer degrees of freedom to

limits the parameter space over which our selection function is valid. Our
final selection function is the product of the completeness fraction and the

improving the performance of the Neural GPU: by carefully designing a
curriculum, and by increasing model size. The latter requires a memory
efficient implementation, as a naive implementation of the Neural GPU is memory
intensive. We find that these techniques increase the set of algorithmic
problems that can be solved by the Neural GPU: we have been able to learn to
perform all the arithmetic operations (and generalize to arbitrarily long

granular material, and how the grain-scale effects give rise to this inertial
drag term. We show that the inertial drag arises from intermittent collisions
with force-chain-like structures. We construct a simple collisional model to
explain the inertial drag, as well as off-axis instability and rotations.
Finally, we show how the granular response changes when the intruder speed
approaches $d/t_c$, leading to a failure of the inertial drag description in

yield results compatible with observations, but this strongly depends on the
asymptotic form of the potential at large $e$-folding numbers. In fact when the

potentially be used as beacons for their formation location if the elemental
gas and grain ratios of planet birth environments, i.e. protoplanetary disks,
are well understood. In disks, the ratios of volatile elements, such as C/O and
N/O, are regulated by the abundance of the main C, N, O carriers, their ice
binding environment, and the presence of snowlines of major volatiles at
different distances from the central star. We explore the effects of disk
dynamical processes, molecular compositions and abundances, and ice
compositions on the snowline locations of the main C, O and N carriers, and the
C/N/O ratios in gas and dust throughout the disk. The gas-phase N/O ratio
enhancement in the outer disk (exterior to the H2O snowline) exceeds the C/O
ratio enhancement for all reasonable volatile compositions. Ice compositions
and disk dynamics individually change the snowline location of N2, the main
nitrogen carrier, by a factor of 2-3, and when considered together the range of
possible N2 snowline locations is ~11- ~79 AU in a standard disk model.
Observations that anchor snowline locations at different stages of planet
formation are therefore key to develop C/N/O ratios as a probe of planet
formation zones.

allow room temperature studies of geometrical frustration; to provide model
statistical mechanical systems where all the relevant parameters in an

microstate of those systems using advanced magnetic microscopy methods. From
this beginning the field has grown to encompass studies of the effects of
quenched disorder, thermally activated dynamics, microwave frequency responses,
magnetotransport properties, and the development of lattice geometries--with
related emergent physics---that have no analog in naturally-occurring

using SDSS data for both shear catalogs and lenses (specifically the BOSS LOWZ

contributions to the covariance matrix and compare them with a simple
analytical model. We show that not subtracting the lensing measurement around
random points from the measurement around the lens sample is equivalent to
performing the measurement using the lens density field instead of the lens
over-density field. While the measurement using the lens density field is
unbiased (in the absence of systematics), its error is significantly larger due
to an additional term in the covariance. Therefore, this subtraction should be
performed regardless of its beneficial effects on systematics. Comparing the
error estimates from data and mocks for estimators that involve the
over-density, we find that the errors are dominated by the shape noise and lens
clustering, that empirically estimated covariances (jackknife and standard
deviation across mocks) are consistent with theoretical estimates, and that
both the connected parts of the 4-point function and the super-sample
covariance can be neglected for the current levels of noise. While the
trade-off between different terms in the covariance depends on the survey
configuration (area, source number density), the diagnostics that we use in
this work should be useful for future works to test their
empirically-determined covariances.

$t$-truncations of cohomological functors coming from $w$. These are closely
related to $t$-structures; so we prove in several cases (including certain
categories of coherent sheaves) that $w$ ""gives"" a $t$-structure (that is

  Using this notion of approximation, we provide a general framework for
solving asymmetric linear systems that is broadly inspired by the work of

we obtain almost linear time algorithms for solving a directed Laplacian linear

expected commute times in a directed graph, and more.
  For each of these problems, our algorithms improves the previous best running

specific signatures on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations. Of
particular importance is its contribution to the B-mode polarization power
spectrum. Indeed, vortical modes sourced by the PMF can dominate the B-mode
power spectrum on small scales, as they survive damping up to a small fraction
of the Silk length. Therefore, measurements of the B-mode polarization at
high-$\ell$ , such as the one recently performed by the South Pole Telescope
(SPT), have the potential to provide stringent constraints on the PMF. We use
the publicly released SPT B-mode polarization spectrum, along with the
temperature and polarization data from the Planck satellite, to derive
constraints on the magnitude, the spectral index and the energy scale at which
the PMF was generated. We find that, while Planck data constrains the magnetic
amplitude to $B_{1 \, \text{Mpc}} < 3.3$ nG at 95\% confidence level (CL), the
SPT measurement improves the constraint to $B_{1 \, \text{Mpc}} < 1.5$ nG. The
magnetic spectral index, $n_B$, and the time of the generation of the PMF are
unconstrained. For a nearly scale-invariant PMF, predicted by simplest
inflationary magnetogenesis models, the bound from Planck+SPT is $B_{1 \,

generated in post-inflationary phase transitions, the 95% CL bound is $B_{1 \,

suite to probe the first stars and galaxies of Milky Way-mass systems. We
quantify the environment of the high-$z$ progenitors of the Milky Way and
connect them to the properties of the host and satellites today. We identify
the formation sites of the first generation of Population III (Pop III) stars
($z$ ~ 25) and first galaxies ($z$ ~ 22) with several different models based on
a minimum halo mass including a simple model for Lyman-Werner feedback. Through
this method we find approximately 23,000 $\pm$ 5,000 Pop III potentially
star-forming sites per Milky Way-mass host, though this number is drastically
reduced to ~550 star-forming sites when Lyman-Werner feedback is included, as
it has critical effects at these length scales. The majority of these halos
identified form in isolation (96% at $z$ = 15) and are not subject to external
enrichment by neighboring halos (median separation ~1 pkpc at $z$ = 15), though
half merge with a system larger than themselves within 1.5 Gyrs. Approximately
55% of the entire population has merged into the host halo by $z$ = 0. Using
particle tagging, we additionally trace the Pop III remnant population to $z$ =
0 and find an order of magnitude scatter in their number density at small (i.e.
r $<$ 5 kpc) and large (i.e. r $>$ 50 kpc) galactocentric radii at $z$ = 0.
Using our large number of realizations, we provide fitting functions for
determining the number of progenitor minihalo and atomic cooling halo systems
that present-day dwarf galaxies and the Magellanic cloud system might have
accreted since their formation. We demonstrate that observed dwarf galaxies
with stellar masses below 10$^{4.6}$ M$_{\odot}$ are unlikely to have merged
with any other star-forming systems.

propose that the holes spiraled together inside a massive star. However, we
show that the heat produced by the dynamical friction on such black hole orbits
can exceed the stellar binding energy by a large factor, which means that this
heat could destroy the star and thus make it difficult for enough gas to be
near the holes at merger to produce detectable photons. These considerations
must be taken into account when models are proposed for electromagnetic
counterparts to the coalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. We find that
only when the two black holes form very close to the center can the star avoid
destruction. In that case, dynamical friction can make the black holes coalesce
faster than they would in vacuum, which leads to a modification of the
gravitational waveform that is potentially observable by advanced LIGO.

deuterium in their cores, yet large enough that they are not so called `dwarf

  To discover life elsewhere in the universe, particularly outside our own

nearby Sun-like stars, since the only example of life we know of thrives on a

understanding the population of exoplanetary systems in the nearby solar

  Signal processing is an integral part of exoplanet detection. From improving
the signal-to-noise ratio of the observed data to applying advanced statistical
signal processing methods, among others, to detect signals (potential planets)

velocity data of only one system is inconsistent with a uni-modal distribution.
We therefore assume that the substructures are only marginal and not of

20 of the highest-redshift quasars, at z>5.8, including the quasar with the

on the observed (rest-frame) optical luminosities and reliable ""virial""
estimates of the BH masses of the quasars, and utilizes scaling relations
derived from thin accretion disk theory. The mass accretion rates through the
postulated disks cover a wide range, dM_disk/dt~4-190 Msol/yr, with most of the
objects (80\%) having dM_disk/dt~10-65 Msol/yr, confirming the
Eddington-limited nature of the accretion flows. By combining our estimates of
dM_disk/dt with conservative, lower limits on the bolometric luminosities of
the quasars, we investigate which alternative values of \eta best account for
all the available data. We find that the vast majority of quasars (~85\%) can
be explained with radiative efficiencies in the range \eta~0.03-0.3, with a
median value close to the commonly assumed \eta=0.1. Within this range, we
obtain conservative estimates of \eta>0.14 for ULAS J1120 and SDSS J0100 (at
z=6.3), and of >0.19 for SDSS J1148 (at z=6.41; assuming their BH masses are
accurate). The implied accretion timescales are generally in the range t_acc =
M_BH / dM_BH/dt ~0.1-1 Gyr, suggesting that most quasars could have had ~1-10
mass e-foldings since BH seed formation. Our analysis therefore demonstrates
that the available luminosities and masses for the highest-redshift quasars can
be explained self-consistently within the thin, radiatively efficient accretion
disk paradigm. Episodes of radiatively inefficient, ""super-critical"" accretion
may have occurred at significantly earlier epochs (i.e., z~10 or above).

SNR, with a lower limit of >=0.1-0.2 Msun. For a mixture of 50% of
silicate-type grains and 50% of carbonaceous grains, we derive a total SN dust
mass between 0.4 Msun and 0.6 Msun. These dust mass estimates are higher than
from most previous studies of Cas A and support the scenario of supernova
dominated dust production at high redshifts. We furthermore derive an
interstellar extinction map for the field around Cas A which towards Cas A
gives average values of A_V=6-8 mag, up to a maximum of A_V=15 mag.

various scenarios that can mimic the planetary signals causing difficulties in
the accurate interpretation of the lens system. In this paper, we present the
analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-0733. The light curve of the
event shows a long-term asymmetric perturbation that would appear to be due to
a planet. From the detailed modeling of the lensing light curve, however, we
find that the perturbation originates from the binarity of the source rather
than the lens. This result demonstrates that binary sources with roughly
equal-luminosity components can mimic long-term perturbations induced by
planets with projected separations near the Einstein ring. The result also
represents the importance of the consideration of various interpretations in
planet-like perturbations and of high-cadence observations for ensuring the
unambiguous detection of the planet.

Sculptor and Leo I analogues. Star formation in Fornax analogues continues for
$\sim3$-$6$ Gyr after infall, whereas Sculptor and Leo I analogues stop forming
stars $< 2$-$3$ Gyr after infall. Fornax analogues typically show more
significant stellar mass loss and exhibit stellar tidal tails, whereas Sculptor
and Leo I analogues, which are more deeply embedded in their host DM haloes at
infall, do not show substantial mass loss due to tides. When additionally
comparing the orbital motion of the host subaloes to the measured proper motion
of Fornax we find the matching more difficult; host subhaloes tend to have
pericentres smaller than that measured for Fornax itself. From the kinematic

lower the level of the H2-dissociating background radiation field required for
DCBH formation substantially, dropping the critical flux by up to a factor of a
few. This translates into a potentially large increase in the expected number
density of DCBHs in the early Universe, and supports the view that DCBHs may be
the seeds for the BHs residing in the centers of a significant fraction of

sustenance, and evolution of the turbulence remain debated. One possibility is
that stellar feedback injects enough energy into the cloud to drive observed
motions on parsec scales. Recent numerical studies of molecular clouds have
found that feedback from stars, such as protostellar outflows and winds,
injects energy and impacts turbulence. We expand upon these studies by
analyzing magnetohydrodynamic simulations of molecular clouds, including
stellar winds, with a range of stellar mass-loss rates and magnetic field
strengths. We generate synthetic $^{12}$CO(1-0) maps assuming that the
simulations are at the distance of the nearby Perseus molecular cloud. By
comparing the outputs from different initial conditions and evolutionary times,
we identify differences in the synthetic observations and characterize these
using common astrostatistics. We quantify the different statistical responses
using a variety of metrics proposed in the literature. We find that multiple
astrostatistics, including principal component analysis, the spectral
correlation function and the velocity coordinate spectrum, are sensitive to
changes in stellar mass-loss rates and/or time evolution. A few statistics,
including the Cramer statistic and velocity coordinate spectrum, are sensitive
to the magnetic field strength. These findings demonstrate that stellar
feedback influences molecular cloud turbulence and can be identified and
quantified observationally using such statistics.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.CR cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Various families of malware use domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to
generate a large number of pseudo-random domain names to connect to a command
and control (C&C) server. In order to block DGA C&C traffic, security
organizations must first discover the algorithm by reverse engineering malware
samples, then generating a list of domains for a given seed. The domains are
then either preregistered or published in a DNS blacklist. This process is not
only tedious, but can be readily circumvented by malware authors using a large
number of seeds in algorithms with multivariate recurrence properties (e.g.,
banjori) or by using a dynamic list of seeds (e.g., bedep). Another technique
to stop malware from using DGAs is to intercept DNS queries on a network and
predict whether domains are DGA generated. Such a technique will alert network
administrators to the presence of malware on their networks. In addition, if
the predictor can also accurately predict the family of DGAs, then network
administrators can also be alerted to the type of malware that is on their
networks. This paper presents a DGA classifier that leverages long short-term
memory (LSTM) networks to predict DGAs and their respective families without
the need for a priori feature extraction. Results are significantly better than
state-of-the-art techniques, providing 0.9993 area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve for binary classification and a micro-averaged F1 score of
0.9906. In other terms, the LSTM technique can provide a 90% detection rate
with a 1:10000 false positive (FP) rate---a twenty times FP improvement over
comparable methods. Experiments in this paper are run on open datasets and code
snippets are provided to reproduce the results.

close to its initial state after some very long but finite time. At the
statistical level, this by itself does not represent a paradox, but apparently
violates the second law of thermodynamics, which may lead to some confusing
conclusions for macroscopic systems. However, this statement does not take
gravity into account. If two particles with a given center of mass energy come
at the distance shorter than the Schwarzschild diameter apart, according to
classical gravity they will form a black hole. In the classical case, a black
hole once formed will always grow and effectively quench the Poincare
recurrence. We derive the condition under which the classical black hole
production rate is higher than the classical Poincare recurrence rate. In the
quantum case, if the temperature of the black hole is lower than the
temperature of the surrounding gas, such a black hole cannot disappear via
Hawking evaporation. We derive the condition which gives us a critical
temperature above which the black hole production is faster than quantum
Poincare recurrence time. However, in quantum case, the quantum Poincare
recurrence theorem can be applied to the black hole states too. The presence of
the black hole can make the recurrence time longer or shorter, depending on
whether the presence of the black hole increases or decreases the total
entropy. We derive the temperature below which the produced black hole
increases the entropy of the whole system (gas particles plus a black hole).
Finally, if evolution of the system is fast enough, then newly formed black
holes will merge and accrete particles until one large black hole dominates the
system. We give the temperature above which the presence of black holes
increase the entropy of the whole system and prolongs the Poincare recurrence
time.

explain the light scalar mesons. Mesonic structures with exotic quantum numbers
have indeed been observed recently, though a controversy persists whether these
are true resonances and not merely kinematical threshold enhancements, or
otherwise states not of a true $q^2\bar{q}^2$ nature. Moreover, puzzling
non-exotic mesons are also often claimed to have a tetraquark configuration.
However, the corresponding model calculations are practically always carried
out in pure and static bound-state approaches, ignoring completely the coupling
to asymptotic two-meson states and unitarity, especially the dynamical effects
thereof. In this short paper we argue that such static predictions of real
tetraquark masses are highly unreliable and provide little evidence of the very
existence of such states.

introduced geometric complexity theory, an approach to study this and related
problems via algebraic geometry and representation theory. Their approach works
by multiplying the permanent polynomial with a high power of a linear form (a
process called padding) and then comparing the orbit closures of the
determinant and the padded permanent. This padding was recently used heavily to
show no-go results for the method of shifted partial derivatives (Efremenko,
Landsberg, Schenck, Weyman, 2016) and for geometric complexity theory
(Ikenmeyer Panova, FOCS 2016 and B\""urgisser, Ikenmeyer Panova, FOCS 2016).
Following a classical homogenization result of Nisan (STOC 1991) we replace the
determinant in geometric complexity theory with the trace of a variable matrix
power. This gives an equivalent but much cleaner homogeneous formulation of
geometric complexity theory in which the padding is removed. This radically
changes the representation theoretic questions involved to prove complexity
lower bounds. We prove that in this homogeneous formulation there are no orbit
occurrence obstructions that prove even superlinear lower bounds on the
complexity of the permanent. This is the first no-go result in geometric
complexity theory that rules out superlinear lower bounds in some model.
Interestingly---in contrast to the determinant---the trace of a variable matrix
power is not uniquely determined by its stabilizer.

sizes, of solar flares they produce, in order to study the relationship between
flare productivity and the magnetic power index. The choice of window size and
inertial range plays a key role in determining the correct magnetic power
index. The overall distribution of magnetic power indices has a range of
$1.0-2.5$. Flare-quiet regions peak at a value of 1.6, however flare-productive

power indices of flare-productive active regions is well separated from
flare-quiet active regions. Only 12\% of flare-quiet regions exhibit an index
greater than 2, whereas 90\% of flare-productive regions exhibit an index
greater than 2. Flare-quiet regions exhibit a high temporal variance (i.e, the
index fluctuates between high and low values), whereas flare-productive regions
maintain an index greater than 2 for several days. This shows the importance of
including the temporal evolution of active regions in flare prediction studies,

membrane proteins into protein clusters in cell membranes. Within the continuum
elasticity theory of membranes, the energy cost of protein-induced bilayer

develop a combined analytic and numerical methodology for the solution of the
equilibrium elastic equations associated with protein-induced lipid bilayer

protein interactions for arbitrary protein symmetries at arbitrary protein
separations and relative orientations. We provide exact analytic solutions for
cylindrical integral membrane proteins with constant and varying hydrophobic
thickness, and develop perturbative analytic solutions for non-cylindrical

find that plasma is still being evacuated from the low corona at the time when
the CMEs reach the COR2 field of view. The temporal evolution of the angular

standard minimization of an objective function at each pyramid level, we train
one deep network per level to compute the flow update. Unlike the recent
FlowNet approach, the networks do not need to deal with large motions; these

Pyramid Network (SPyNet) is much simpler and 96% smaller than FlowNet in terms
of model parameters. This makes it more efficient and appropriate for embedded
applications. Second, since the flow at each pyramid level is small (< 1
pixel), a convolutional approach applied to pairs of warped images is
appropriate. Third, unlike FlowNet, the learned convolution filters appear
similar to classical spatio-temporal filters, giving insight into the method
and how to improve it. Our results are more accurate than FlowNet on most
standard benchmarks, suggesting a new direction of combining classical flow

pp-RPA so that it can be efficiently applied to larger molecules and even
solids. This paper introduces an $O(N^3)$ algorithm, where $N$ is the number of

contamination and possible differential reddening; it is a relatively
understudied cluster for these reasons, but its location makes it a key object

  Aims: New data from the Gaia-ESO Survey enable the first ever radial velocity
and spectroscopic metallicity measurements for this cluster. We aim to use
velocities to isolate cluster members, providing more leverage for determining
cluster parameters.
  Methods: Gaia-ESO Survey data for 167 potential members have yielded radial
velocity measurements, which were used to determine the systemic velocity of
the cluster and membership of individual stars. Atmospheric parameters were
also used as a check on membership when available. Literature photometry was
used to re-determine cluster parameters based on radial velocity member stars
only; theoretical isochrones are fit in the V, V-I diagram. Cluster abundance
measurements of ten radial-velocity member stars with high-resolution

for HI and OH absorption towards the gravitationally lensed quasars
PKSB1830$-$211 and MGJ0414$+$0534. Although we detected all previously reported
intervening systems towards PKSB1830$-$211, in the case of MGJ0414+0534 three
systems were not found, indicating that the original identifications may have
been confused with radio frequency interference. Given the sensitivity of our

frequency of intervening HI systems estimated from previous surveys for 21-cm
emission in nearby galaxies and $z \sim 3$ damped Lyman $\alpha$ absorbers. We
find spectral variability in the $z = 0.886$ face-on spiral galaxy towards
PKSB1830$-$211, from observations undertaken with the Westerbork Synthesis
Radio Telescope in 1997/1998 and ASKAP BETA in 2014/2015. The HI equivalent
width varies by a few per cent over approximately yearly time-scales. This
long-term spectral variability is correlated between the north-east and
south-west images of the core, and with the total flux density of the source,
implying that it is observationally coupled to intrinsic changes in the quasar.
The absence of any detectable variability in the ratio of HI associated with
the two core images is in stark contrast to the behaviour previously seen in
the molecular lines. We therefore infer that coherent opaque HI structures in
this galaxy are larger than the parsec-scale molecular clouds found at
mm-wavelengths.

co-covariant theories). Following the seminal paper by Narlikar and Kembhavi,
we provide an explicit construction of singularity-free spherically symmetric
and axi-symmetric exact solutions for black hole spacetimes conformally
equivalent to the Schwarzschild or the Kerr spacetime. We first check the
absence of divergences in the Kretschmann invariant for the rescaled metrics.
Afterwords, we show that the new types of black holes are geodesically complete
and linked by a Newman-Janis transformation just as in standard general
relativity (based on Einstein-Hilbert action). Furthermore, we argue that no
massive or massless particles can reach the former Schwarzschild singularity or
touch the former Kerr ring singularity in a finite amount of their proper time
or of their affine parameter. Finally, we discuss the Raychaudhuri equation in
a co-covariant theory and we show that the expansion parameter for congruences
of both types of geodesics (for massless and massive particles) never reaches
minus infinity. Actually, the null geodesics become parallel at the $r=0$ point
in the Schwarzschild spacetime (the origin) and the focusing of geodesics is
avoided. The arguments of regularity of curvature invariants, geodesic
completeness, and finiteness of geodesics' expansion parameter ensure us that

interactions among multiway data. Multi-linear tensor composition methods, such
as the Tucker decomposition and the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP), assume that the
complex interactions among objects are multi-linear, and are thus insufficient
to represent nonlinear relationships in data. Another assumption of these
methods is that a predefined rank should be known. However, the rank of tensors
is hard to estimate, especially for cases with missing values. To address these
issues, we design a Bayesian generative model for tensor decomposition.
Different from the traditional Bayesian methods, the high-order interactions of
tensor entries are modeled with variational auto-encoder. The proposed model
takes advantages of Neural Networks and nonparametric Bayesian models, by
replacing the multi-linear product in traditional Bayesian tensor decomposition
with a complex nonlinear function (via Neural Networks) whose parameters can be
learned from data. Experimental results on synthetic data and real-world
chemometrics tensor data have demonstrated that our new model can achieve
significantly higher prediction performance than the state-of-the-art tensor

generalization accuracy and efficiency of prediction models. Many models such
as SVM, random forest, and deep neural nets have been proposed and achieved
great success. However, what emerges as missing in many applications is
actionability, i.e., the ability to turn prediction results into actions. For
example, in applications such as customer relationship management, clinical
prediction, and advertisement, the users need not only accurate prediction, but
also actionable instructions which can transfer an input to a desirable goal
(e.g., higher profit repays, lower morbidity rates, higher ads hit rates).
Existing effort in deriving such actionable knowledge is few and limited to
simple action models which restricted to only change one attribute for each
action. The dilemma is that in many real applications those action models are
often more complex and harder to extract an optimal solution.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach that achieves actionability by
combining learning with planning, two core areas of AI. In particular, we
propose a framework to extract actionable knowledge from random forest, one of
the most widely used and best off-the-shelf classifiers. We formulate the
actionability problem to a sub-optimal action planning (SOAP) problem, which is
to find a plan to alter certain features of a given input so that the random
forest would yield a desirable output, while minimizing the total costs of
actions. Technically, the SOAP problem is formulated in the SAS+ planning
formalism, and solved using a Max-SAT based approach. Our experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach on a
personal credit dataset and other benchmarks. Our work represents a new
application of automated planning on an emerging and challenging machine
learning paradigm.

noninteracting one-dimensional fermions with known uniform semiclassical
approximations to the density and kinetic energy. Their structure is analyzed,
and contributions from distinct phase space regions (classically-allowed versus
forbidden at the Fermi energy) are derived analytically. Universal formulas are
derived for both particle numbers and energy components in each region. For
example, in the semiclassical limit, exactly 1/(6\pi3^{1/2}) of a particle
leaks into the evanescent region beyond a turning point. The correct
normalization of semiclassical densities is proven analytically in the
semiclassical limit. Energies and densities are tested numerically in a variety
of one-dimensional potentials, especially in the limit where TF theory becomes
exact. The subtle relation between the pointwise accuracy of the semiclassical
approximation and integrated expectation values is explored. The limitations of
the semiclassical formulas are also investigated when the potential varies too
rapidly. The approximations are shown to work for multiple wells, except right
at the mid-phase point of the evanescent regions. The implications for density

suggested that the quantum pressure from the FDM can significantly affect the
structure formation in small scales, thus alleviating the so-called

the quantum pressure and illustrate the interactions among FDM particles in the

(0.02 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 0.05) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, with HI data
from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey. Using key HI-to-stellar
mass scaling relations, we present evidence that the gas content of satellite
galaxies is, to a significant extent, dependent on the environment in which a
galaxy resides. For the first time, we demonstrate that systematic
environmental suppression of gas content at both fixed stellar mass and fixed
specific star formation rate (sSFR) in satellite galaxies begins in halo masses
typical of the group regime (log M$_{h}$/M$_{\odot}$ < 13.5), well before
galaxies reach the cluster environment. We also show that environment driven
gas depletion is more closely associated to halo mass than local density. Our
results are then compared with state-of-the-art semi-analytic models and
hydrodynamical simulations and discussed within this framework, showing that
more work is needed if models are to reproduce the observations. We conclude
that the observed decrease of gas content in the group and cluster environments
cannot be reproduced by starvation of the gas supply alone and invoke fast

the cosmic curvature by combining the most recent Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and
supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) data. Based on the $H(z)$ data, we first use the
model-independent smoothing technique, Gaussian processes, to construct
distance modulus $\mu_{H}(z)$, which is susceptible to the cosmic curvature
parameter $\Omega_{k}$. In contrary to previous studies, the light-curve
fitting parameters, which account for distance estimation of SN
($\mu_{SN}(z)$), are set free to investigate whether $\Omega_{k}$ has a
dependence on them. By comparing $\mu_{H}(z)$ to $\mu_{SN}(z)$, we put limits
on $\Omega_{k}$. Our results confirm that $\Omega_{k}$ is independent of the SN
light-curve parameters. Moreover, we show that the measured $\Omega_{k}$ is in
good agreement with zero cosmic curvature, implying that there is no
significant deviation from a flat Universe at the current observational data
level. We also test the influence of different $H(z)$ samples and different
Hubble constant $H_{0}$ values, finding that different $H(z)$ samples do not
present significant impact on the constraints. However, different $H_{0}$
priors can affect the constraints of $\Omega_{k}$ in some degree. The prior of
$H_{0}=73.24\pm1.74$ km $\rm s^{-1}$ $\rm Mpc^{-1}$ gives a value of
$\Omega_{k}$ a little bit above $1\sigma$ confidence level away from 0, but

tends to suppress the asymmetry between neighboring carbons induced by h-BN

model with onsite Coulomb repulsion treated within coherent potential
approximation, where hopping parameters are derived from density functional
theory calculations based on the graphene/h-BN heterostructure. Our results
indicate that both gapless and gapped states observed experimentally in

as a greedy algorithm for linear ill-posed inverse problems. This algorithm
incorporates the Tikhonov-Phillips regularization which implies the necessity
of a parameter choice. In this paper, some known parameter choice methods are
evaluated with respect to their performance in the RFMP and its enhancement,
the regularized orthogonal functional matching pursuit (ROFMP). As an example
of a linear inverse problem, the downward continuation of gravitational field
data from the satellite orbit to the Earth's surface is chosen, because it is
exponentially ill-posed. For the test scenarios, different satellite heights
with several noise-to-signal ratios and kinds of noise are combined. The
performances of the parameter choice strategies in these scenarios are
analyzed. For example, it is shown that a strongly scattered set of data points
is an essentially harder challenge for the regularization than a regular grid.
The obtained results yield a first orientation which parameter choice methods

support standard Data Mining tasks. The problem is important for two reasons.
First, it is commonplace to perform data mining tasks such as clustering and
classification of network attributes (attributes of the nodes, including social
media posts). Furthermore, the extraordinarily large size of real-world
networks necessitates that we work with a smaller graph sample. Second, while
random sampling will provide an unbiased estimate of content, random access is
often unavailable for many networks. Hence, network samplers such as Snowball
sampling, Forest Fire, Random Walk, Metropolis-Hastings Random Walk are widely
used; however, these attribute-agnostic samplers were designed to capture
salient properties of network structure, not node content. The latter is
critical for clustering and classification tasks. There are three contributions
of this paper. First, we introduce several attribute-aware samplers based on
Information Theoretic principles. Second, we prove that these samplers have a
bias towards capturing new content, and are equivalent to uniform sampling in
the limit. Finally, our experimental results over large real-world datasets and
synthetic benchmarks are insightful: attribute-aware samplers outperform both
random sampling and baseline attribute-agnostic samplers by a wide margin in
clustering and classification tasks.

main memory size in number of words. This matches the lower bound for
comparison-based sorting and is hence optimal for comparison-based priority

the best known priority queue is only $O((N/B) \lg_2 N)$ I/Os. The big open
question is whether a degradation in performance really is necessary. We answer
this question affirmatively by proving a lower bound of $\Omega((N/B) \lg_{\lg

DecreaseKey operations. Our lower bound is proved in the cell probe model and
thus holds also for non-comparison-based priority queues.

into the standard tool that it is today.
  Many special cases of pattern matching have been studied that can be solved
faster than in quadratic time. However, a systematic study of tractable cases
was made possible only recently, with the first conditional lower bounds
reported by Backurs and Indyk [FOCS'16]. Restricted to any ""type"" of
homogeneous regular expressions of depth 2 or 3, they either presented a
near-linear time algorithm or a quadratic conditional lower bound, with one
exception known as the Word Break problem.
  In this paper we complete their work as follows:
  1) We present two almost-linear time algorithms that generalize all known
almost-linear time algorithms for special cases of regular expression
membership testing.
  2) We classify all types, except for the Word Break problem, into
almost-linear time or quadratic time assuming the Strong Exponential Time
Hypothesis. This extends the classification from depth 2 and 3 to any constant
depth.
  3) For the Word Break problem we give an improved $\tilde{O}(n m^{1/3} + m)$
algorithm. Surprisingly, we also prove a matching conditional lower bound for
combinatorial algorithms. This establishes Word Break as the only intermediate
problem.

  problem",,,,,"math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we explore the similarity between normal homogeneity and
$\delta$-homogeneity in Finsler geometry. They are both non-negatively curved
Finsler spaces. We show that any connected $\delta$-homogeneous Finsler space
is $G$-$\delta$-homo-geneous, for some suitably chosen connected quasi-compact
$G$. So $\delta$-homogeneous Finsler metrics can be defined by a bi-invariant
singular metric on $G$ and submersion, just as normal homogeneous metrics,
using a bi-invariant Finsler metric on $G$ instead. More careful analysis
shows, in the space of all Finsler metrics on $G/H$, the subset of all
$G$-$\delta$-homogeneous ones is in fact the closure for the subset of all
$G$-normal ones, in the local $C^0$-topology (Theorem \ref{main-thm-1}). Using
this approximation technique, the classification work for positively curved
normal homogeneous Finsler spaces can be applied to classify positively curved
$\delta$-homogeneous Finsler spaces, which provides the same classification
list. As a by-product, this argument tells more about $\delta$-homogeneous
Finsler metrics satisfying the (FP) condition (a weaker version of positively
curved condition).

calculation of alpha-induced reaction cross sections at low energies in the
statistical model...
  Purpose: The present work studies the total reaction cross section sigma_reac
of alpha-induced reactions at low energies which can be determined from the
elastic scattering angular distribution or from the sum over the cross sections
of all open non-elastic channels.
  Method: Elastic and inelastic 64Zn(a,a)64Zn angular distributions were
measured at two energies around the Coulomb barrier at 12.1 MeV and 16.1 MeV.
Reaction cross sections of the (a,g), (a,n), and (a,p) reactions were measured
at the same energies using the activation technique. The contributions of
missing non-elastic channels were estimated from statistical model
calculations.
  Results: The total reaction cross sections from elastic scattering and from
the sum of the cross sections over all open non-elastic channels agree well
within the uncertainties. This finding confirms the consistency of the
experimental data. At the higher energy of 16.1 MeV, the predicted significant
contribution of compound-inelastic scattering to the total reaction cross
section is confirmed experimentally. As a by-product it is found that most
recent global alpha-nucleus potentials are able to describe the reaction cross
sections for 64Zn around the Coulomb barrier.
  Conclusions: Total reaction cross sections of alpha-induced reactions can be
well determined from elastic scattering angular distributions. The present
study proves experimentally that the total cross section from elastic
scattering is identical to the sum of non-elastic reaction cross sections.
Thus, the statistical model can reliably be used to distribute the total
reaction cross section among the different open channels.

photodetectors. Both responsivity and response speed are higher in air than in

free electrons in the conduction band, thus reducing the recombination
processes. The photodetectors are sensitive to light polarization, with an
anisotropy ratio of 12%. These results highlight the interesting combination of
large surface area and low 1D transport resistance in electrospun TiO2 fibres.

when workers not only answer a crowdsourcer's questions but also contribute new

This growth creates an inherent bias for early questions since a question
introduced earlier by a worker can be answered by more subsequent workers than

technique called Mixed Norm (MN) to estimate the best motion vector for a given

different sources of error. The motion vector estimation takes into
consideration local image properties and it results from the minimization of a
mixed norm functional with a regularization parameter depending on the

The usual
algorithms for the computation of the likelihood of an ARMA model require
$O(n)$ flops per function evaluation. Using our new approximation, an algorithm
is developed which requires only $O(1)$ flops in repeated likelihood
evaluations. In most cases, the new algorithm gives results identical to or
very close to the exact maximum likelihood estimate (MLE). This algorithm is
easily implemented in high level Quantitative Programming Environments (QPEs)
such as {\it Mathematica\/}, MatLab and R. In order to obtain reasonable speed,
previous ARMA maximum likelihood algorithms are usually implemented in C or
some other machine efficient language. With our algorithm it is easy to do
maximum likelihood estimation for long time series directly in the QPE of your
choice. The new algorithm is extended to obtain the MLE for the mean parameter.
Simulation experiments which illustrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm
are discussed. {\it Mathematica\/} and R packages which implement the algorithm
discussed in this paper are available (McLeod and Zhang, 2007). Based on these
package implementations, it is expected that the interested researcher would be
able to implement this algorithm in other QPE's.

using the abstract framework of the additive Schwarz method, and an idea of
adaptive coarse spaces. In one variant, the coarse space consists of finite
element functions associated with the wire basket nodes and functions based on
solving some generalized eigenvalue problem on the faces, and in the other
variant, it contains functions associated with the vertex nodes with functions
based on solving some generalized eigenvalue problems on subdomain faces and on
subdomain edges. The functions that are used to build the coarse spaces are
chosen adaptively, they correspond to the eigenvalues that are smaller than a
given threshold. The convergence rate of the preconditioned conjugate gradients
method in both cases, is shown to be independent of the variations in the
coefficients for sufficient number of eigenfunctions in the coarse space.

that shear strain is the main electronic mechanism promoting linear

via deformation potential, and makes their radiative recombination faster via
piezoelectricity. Implications of this mechanism are that linear emission can
be enhanced by growing long but thin CdS shells around large, prolate CdSe
cores, which indeed supports and rationalizes recent experimental findings.
Together with the well-known dielectric effects, these results pave the way for
controlled degree of linear polarization in dot-in-rods through dedicated

applications that require high resolution in a localized area of the
computational domain or near complex geometries. Two key properties for
non-conforming methods to be applicable to real world applications are
conservation and energy stability. The summation-by-parts (SBP) property, which
certain finite-difference and discontinuous Galerkin methods have, finds
success for the numerical approximation of hyperbolic conservation laws,
because the proofs of energy stability and conservation can discretely mimic
the continuous analysis of partial differential equations. In addition, SBP
methods can be developed with high-order accuracy, which is useful for
simulations that contain multiple spatial and temporal scales. However,
existing non-conforming SBP schemes result in a reduction of the overall degree
of the scheme, which leads to a reduction in the order of the solution error.
This loss of degree is due to the particular interface coupling through a
simultaneous-approximation-term (SAT). We present in this work a novel class of
SBP-SAT operators that maintain conservation, energy stability, and have no
loss of the degree of the scheme for non-conforming approximations. The new
\emph{degree preserving} discretizations require an ansatz that the norm matrix
of the SBP operator is of a degree $\geq 2p$, in contrast to, for example,
existing finite difference SBP operators, where the norm matrix is $2p-1$
accurate. We demonstrate the fundamental properties of the new scheme with
rigorous mathematical analysis as well as numerical verification.

left module which is either quasi-projective or flat is quasi-flat. A
characterization of local commutative rings for which each ideal is quasi-flat
(resp. quasi-projective) is given. It is also proven that each commutative ring
R whose finitely generated ideals are quasi-flat is of $\lambda$-dimension
$\le$ 3, and this dimension $\le$ 2 if R is local. This extends a former result
about the class of arithmetical rings. Moreover, if R has a unique minimal
prime ideal then its finitely generated ideals are quasi-projective if they are
quasi-flat. In [1] Abuhlail, Jarrar and Kabbaj studied the class of commutative
fqp-rings (finitely generated ideals are quasi-projective). They proved that
this class of rings strictly contains the one of arithmetical rings and is
strictly contained in the one of Gaussian rings. It is also shown that the
property for a commutative ring to be fqp is preserved by localization. It is
known that a commutative ring R is arithmetical (resp. Gaussian) if and only if
R M is arithmetical (resp. Gaussian) for each maximal ideal M of R. But an
example given in [6] shows that a commutative ring which is a locally fqp-ring
is not necessarily a fqp-ring. So, in this cited paper the class of fqf-rings
is introduced. Each local commutative fqf-ring is a fqp-ring, and a commutative
ring is fqf if and only if it is locally fqf. These fqf-rings are defined in
[6] without a definition of quasi-flat modules. Here we propose a definition of
these modules and another definition of fqf-ring which is equivalent to the one
given in [6]. We also introduce the module property of self-flatness. Each
quasi-flat module is self-flat but we do not know if the converse holds. On the
other hand, each flat module is quasi-flat and any finitely generated module is
quasi-flat if and only if it is flat modulo its annihilator. In Section 2 we
give a complete characterization of local commutative rings for which each
ideal is self-flat. These rings R are fqp and their nilradical N is the subset
of zerodivisors of R. In the case where R is not a chain ring for which N = N 2
and R N is not coherent every ideal is flat modulo its annihilator. Then in
Section 3 we deduce that any ideal of a chain ring (valuation ring) R is
quasi-projective if and only if it is almost maximal and each zerodivisor is
nilpotent. This complete the results obtained by Hermann in [11] on valuation
domains. In Section 4 we show that each commutative fqf-ring is of
$\lambda$-dimension $\le$ 3. This extends the result about arithmetical rings
obtained in [4]. Moreover it is shown that this $\lambda$-dimension is $\le$ 2
in the local case. But an example of a local Gaussian ring R of
$\lambda$-dimension $\ge$ 3 is given.

agents, where each agent has only access to its own local convex objective

are assumed to be uniformly strongly connected. A column stochastic mixing
matrices is employed in the algorithm, which also exactly steers all the agents
to asymptotically converge to a global and consensual optimal solution even
under the assumption that the step-sizes are uncoordinated. Two fairly standard
conditions for achieving the geometrical convergence rate are established under
the assumption that the objective functions are strong convexity and have
Lipschitz continuous gradient. The theoretical analysis shows that the
distributed algorithm is capable of driving the whole network to geometrically
converge to an optimal solution of the convex optimization problem as long as
the uncoordinated step-sizes do not exceed some upper bounds. We also give an
explicit analysis for the convergence rate of our algorithm through a different

mesoscopic linear statistics. There are two regimes depending on the scale
parameter and the thinning parameter. In one regime we obtain a CLT of a
classical type and in the other regime we retrieve the CLT for CUE. The two
regimes are separated by a critical line. On the critical line the limiting
fluctuations are no longer Gaussian, but described by infinitely divisible
laws. We argue that this transition phenomenon is universal by showing that the

confirm that the Milne model fits the data just as well as LCDM. We show that
this unexpected result points to a weakness in the Hubble diagram rather than
to a flaw in LCDM. It seems the Hubble diagram is insensitive to spatial
curvature. Here we present the data and both models in a scale factor vs.
cosmological time plot.This plot is exquisitely sensitive to spatial curvature
because one of three unique transformations, for each of curvatures 0,+1,-1, is
applied to transform from the Hubble diagram. Although the Milne negative
curvature did not matter much in the Hubble diagram, it matters critically in
the scale factor plot. Given that space is flat as measured by precise CMB
observations, we find that when the SNe data, the LCDM model and the Milne
model are plotted as scale factor vs. cosmological time the two resulting
curves separate at 2 sigma above the noise- ten times their separation above
the noise in the Hubble diagram. The transformed data fit to the LCDM model
confirms, at a 95% confidence level, that the universe is accelerating and the

heuristic that replicates their experiences from the first stage (the fast

best action given the aggregate observations of all group members. We study the
implications of the information structure together with the properties of the
probability distributions which determine the structure of the so-called
""Bayesian heuristics"" that the agents follow in our model. We also analyze the
group decision outcomes in two classes of linear action updates and log-linear
belief updates and show that many inefficiencies arise in group decisions as a
result of repeated interactions between individuals, leading to overconfident
beliefs as well as choice-shifts toward extremes. Nevertheless, balanced
regular structures demonstrate a measure of efficiency in terms of aggregating
the initial information of individuals. These results not only verify some
well-known insights about group decision-making but also complement these
insights by revealing additional mechanistic interpretations for the group
declension-process, as well as psychological and cognitive intuitions about the
group interaction model.

conventional Phase Shift Keying (PSK) for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)
systems, is introduced. In PSKH, constellation points are distributed on a
multidimensional hypersphere. The use of such constellations with a
Peak-To-Average-Sum-Power-Ratio (PASPR) of 1 allows to use load-modulated
transmitters which can cope with a small backoff, which in turn results in a
high power efficiency. In this paper, we discuss several methods how to
generate PSKH constellations and compare their performance. After applying
conventional Pulse-Amplitude Modulation (PAM), the PASPR of the continuous time
PSKH signal depends on the choice of the pulse shaping method. This choice also
influences bandwidth and power efficiency of a PSKH system. In order to reduce
the PASPR of the continuous transmission signal, we use spherical interpolation
to generate a smooth signal over the hypersphere and present corresponding
receiver techniques. Additionally, complexity reduction techniques are proposed
and compared. Finally, we discuss the methods presented in this paper regarding
their trade-offs with respect to PASPR, bandwidth, power efficiency and
receiver complexity.

characteristic ages between 12 kyr and 2 Myr, and spin-down powers between

a pattern, and the analysis of its composition is, currently, one of the
challenging problems of bioinformatics. In the present study, the possibility
of evaluating metagenome composition by DNA-marker methods is investigated.
These methods are based on using primers, short nucleic acid fragments. Each
primer picks out of the tested genome the fragment set specific just for this
genome, which is called its spectrum (for the given primer) and is used for
identifying the genome. The DNA-marker method, applied to a metagenome, also
gives its spectrum, which, obviously, represents the union of the spectra of
all genomes belonging to the metagenome. Thus each primer provides a projection
of the genomes and of the metagenome onto the corresponding spectra set. Here
we propose to apply the random projection (random primer) approach for
analyzing metagenome composition and present some estimates of the method
effectiveness for the case of Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)

based on a Fokker-Planck equation for $g(h)$ (Toppaladoddi \& Wettlaufer
\emph{Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 115}, 148501, 2015), in which the thermodynamic
growth rates are determined using observed climatology. In particular, the
Fokker-Planck equation is coupled to the observationally consistent
thermodynamic model of Eisenman \& Wettlaufer (\emph{Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
USA} {\bf 106}, pp. 28-32, 2009). We find that due to the combined effects of
thermodynamics and mechanics, $g(h)$ spreads during winter and contracts during
summer. This behavior is in agreement with recent satellite observations from
CryoSat-2 (Kwok \& Cunningham, \emph{Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A} {\bf 373},
20140157, 2015). Because $g(h)$ is a probability density function, we quantify
all of the key moments (e.g., mean thickness, fraction of thin/thick ice, mean
albedo, relaxation time scales) as greenhouse-gas radiative forcing, $\Delta
F_0$, increases. The mean ice thickness decays exponentially with $\Delta F_0$,
but {\em much slower} than do solely thermodynamic models. This exhibits the
crucial role that ice mechanics plays in maintaining the ice cover, by
redistributing thin ice to thick ice--far more rapidly than can thermal growth
alone.

First, we introduce an anomalous pattern initialisation method for hierarchical

sufficiently large number of clusters. This allows the cluster merging process
to start from this partition rather than from a trivial partition composed
solely of singletons. Our second contribution is an extension of the Ward and
Ward p algorithms to the situation where the feature weight exponent can differ
from the exponent of the Minkowski distance. This new method, called A-Ward
p\b{eta} , is able to generate a much wider variety of clustering solutions. We
also demonstrate that its parameters can be estimated reasonably well by using
a cluster validity index. We perform numerous experiments using data sets with
two types of noise, insertion of noise features and blurring within-cluster
values of some features. These experiments allow us to conclude: (i) our
anomalous pattern initialisation method does indeed reduce the time a
hierarchical clustering algorithm takes to complete, without negatively
impacting its cluster recovery ability; (ii) A-Ward p\b{eta} provides better
cluster recovery than both Ward and Ward p.

termination problem for probabilistic programs with real-valued variables.
Previous works focused on the qualitative problem that asks whether an input
program terminates with probability~1 (almost-sure termination). A powerful
approach for this qualitative problem is the notion of ranking supermartingales
with respect to a given set of invariants. The quantitative problem
(probabilistic termination) asks for bounds on the termination probability. A
fundamental and conceptual drawback of the existing approaches to address
probabilistic termination is that even though the supermartingales consider the
probabilistic behavior of the programs, the invariants are obtained completely
ignoring the probabilistic aspect.
  In this work we address the probabilistic termination problem for
linear-arithmetic probabilistic programs with nondeterminism. We define the
notion of {\em stochastic invariants}, which are constraints along with a
probability bound that the constraints hold. We introduce a concept of {\em
repulsing supermartingales}. First, we show that repulsing supermartingales can
be used to obtain bounds on the probability of the stochastic invariants.
Second, we show the effectiveness of repulsing supermartingales in the
following three ways: (1)~With a combination of ranking and repulsing
supermartingales we can compute lower bounds on the probability of termination;
(2)~repulsing supermartingales provide witnesses for refutation of almost-sure
termination; and (3)~with a combination of ranking and repulsing
supermartingales we can establish persistence properties of probabilistic
programs.
  We also present results on related computational problems and an experimental
evaluation of our approach on academic examples.

be obtained in this way. Some of these geometries had a rich development, most
remarkably hyperbolic geometry and the Lorentzian geometries of Minkowski, de
Sitter and anti-de Sitter spaces, which in higher dimension have had large
interest for a long time in mathematical physics and more precisely in General
Relativity. Moreover, some degenerate spaces appear naturally in the picture,
namely the co-Euclidean space (the space of hyperplanes of the Euclidean
space), and the co-Minkowski space (that we will restrict to the space of
space-like hyperplanes of Minkowski space), first because of duality reasons,
and second because they appear as limits of degeneration of classical spaces.
In fact, co-Minkowski space recently regained interest under the name half-pipe
geometry. The purpose of the present paper is to provide a survey on the
properties of these spaces, especially in dimensions 2 and 3, from the point of
view of projective geometry. Even with this perspective, the paper does not aim

concern convex subsets and their duality, degeneration of geometries and some
properties of surfaces in three-dimensional spaces. The presentation is

either on their accretion or their migration only. In this work we study both
processes concurrently to investigate how they might mutually affect each
other. We modeled a 2-dimensional disk with a steady accretion flow onto the
central star and embed a Jupiter mass planet at 5.2 au. The disk is locally
isothermal and viscosity is modeled using a constant $\alpha$. The planet is
held on a fixed orbit for a few hundred orbits to allow the disk to adapt and
carve a gap. After this period, the planet is released and free to move
according to the gravitational interaction with the gas disk. The mass
accretion onto the planet is modeled by removing a fraction of gas from the
inner Hill sphere, and the removed mass and momentum can be added to the
planet. Our results show that a fast migrating planet is able to accrete more
gas than a slower migrating planet. Utilizing a tracer fluid we analyzed the
origin of the accreted gas which comes predominantly originating from the inner
disk for a fast migrating planet. In case of slower migration the fraction of
gas from the outer disk increases. We also found that even for very high
accretion rates in some cases gas crosses the planetary gap from the inner to
the outer disk. Our simulations show that the crossing of gas changes during
the migration process as the migration rate slows down. Therefore classical
type II migration where the planet migrates with the viscous drift rate and no
gas crosses the gap is no general process but may only occur for special
parameters and at a certain time during the orbital evolution of the planet.

constraints to the nature of its nuclear power source. Methods. We used
Herschel Space Observatory far-infrared and submillimeter observations of H2O
and OH rotational lines in Arp 299A to create a multi-component model of the
galaxy. In doing this, we employed a spherically symmetric radiative transfer
code. Results. Nine H2O lines in absorption and eight in emission as well as
four OH doublets in absorption and one in emission, are detected in Arp 299A.
No lines of the 18O isotopologues, which have been seen in compact obscured
nuclei of other galaxies, are detected. The absorption in the ground state OH
doublet at 119 {\mu}m is found redshifted by ~175 km/s compared to other OH and
H2O lines, suggesting a low excitation inflow. We find that at least two
components are required in order to account for the excited molecular line
spectrum. The inner component has a radius of 20-25 pc, a very high infrared
surface brightness (> 3e13 Lsun/kpc^2), warm dust (Td > 90 K), and a large H2
column density (NH2 > 1e24 cm^-2). The outer component is larger (50-100 pc)
with slightly cooler dust (70-90 K). In addition, a much more extended
inflowing component is required to also account for the OH doublet at 119
{\mu}m. Conclusions. The Compton-thick nature of the core makes it difficult to
determine the nature of the buried power source, but the high surface
brightness indicates that it is either an active galactic nucleus and/or a
dense nuclear starburst. The high OH/H2O ratio in the nucleus indicates that
ion-neutral chemistry induced by X-rays or cosmic-rays is important. Finally we
find a lower limit to the 16O/18O ratio of 400 in the nuclear region, possibly
indicating that the nuclear starburst is in an early evolutionary stage, or
that it is fed through a molecular inflow of, at most, solar metallicity.

high-density environments, the group mass function has higher number densities
in filaments compared to that outside of filaments towards the massive end. The
relation is opposite in low-density environments. At fixed group mass and
large-scale luminosity density, groups in filaments are slightly more luminous
and their central galaxies have redder colors, higher stellar masses, and lower
specific star formation rates than those outside of filaments. However, the
differences in central galaxy and group properties in and outside of filaments
are not clear in some group mass bins. We show that the differences in central
galaxy properties are due to the higher abundances of elliptical galaxies in
filaments. Filamentary structures in the cosmic web are not simply visual
associations of galaxies, but rather play an important role in shaping the
properties of groups and their central galaxies. The differences in central
galaxy and group properties in and outside of cosmic web filaments are not
simple effects related to large-scale environmental density. The results point

black holes (SMBHs) brighten galactic nuclei and reveal a population of
otherwise dormant black holes. Adopting event rates from the literature, we aim
to establish general trends in the redshift evolution of the TDE number counts
and their observable signals. We pay particular attention to two types of TDEs
which are expected to be observable out to high redshifts, namely (i) jetted
TDEs whose luminosity is boosted by relativistic beaming, and (ii) TDEs around
binary black holes. We show that the brightest (jetted) TDEs are expected to be
produced by massive black hole binaries if the occupancy of intermediate mass
black holes (IMBHs) in low mass galaxies is high. The same binary population
will also provide gravitational wave sources for eLISA. In addition, we find
that the shape of the X-ray luminosity function of TDEs strongly depends on the
occupancy of IMBHs and could be used to constrain scenarios of SMBH formation.
Finally, we make predictions for the expected number of TDEs observed by future
X-ray telescopes as a function of their sensitivity limits. We find that an
instrument which is 50 times more sensitive than the Burst Alert Telescope
(BAT) on board the Swift satellite is expected to trigger ~10 times more events
than BAT with 50% of the events coming from z>2. Because of their long decay
times, high-redshift TDEs can be mistaken for fixed point sources in deep field
surveys such as the 4Ms survey with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and targeted
observations of the same deep field with year-long intervals could reveal TDEs.
If the occupation fraction of IMBHs is high, 6-20 TDEs are expected in each
deep field observed by a telescope 50 times more sensitive than Chandra.

them as consequences of a dynamic process relying on optimal inference with
respect to a generative model. The present study details the complete
formulation of such a generative model intended to probe visual motion
perception with a dynamic texture model. It is first derived in a set of
axiomatic steps constrained by biological plausibility. We extend previous
contributions by detailing three equivalent formulations of this texture model.
First, the composite dynamic textures are constructed by the random aggregation
of warped patterns, which can be viewed as 3D Gaussian fields. Secondly, these
textures are cast as solutions to a stochastic partial differential equation
(sPDE). This essential step enables real time, on-the-fly texture synthesis
using time-discretized auto-regressive processes. It also allows for the
derivation of a local motion-energy model, which corresponds to the
log-likelihood of the probability density. The log-likelihoods are essential
for the construction of a Bayesian inference framework. We use the dynamic
texture model to psychophysically probe speed perception in humans using
zoom-like changes in the spatial frequency content of the stimulus. The human
data replicates previous findings showing perceived speed to be positively
biased by spatial frequency increments. A Bayesian observer who combines a
Gaussian likelihood centered at the true speed and a spatial frequency
dependent width with a ""slow speed prior"" successfully accounts for the
perceptual bias. More precisely, the bias arises from a decrease in the
observer's likelihood width estimated from the experiments as the spatial
frequency increases. Such a trend is compatible with the trend of the dynamic
texture likelihood width.

flops than the input matrix has entries, but we prove that much fewer flops
than entries are sufficient in the case of the average input (""flop"" stands for
""floating point arithmetic operation""). We prove this twice -- for the
solutions by means of two distinct algorithms, and we analyze them by applying
two different approaches. Our analysis of both algorithms is quite involved,
but we devise them mostly by simplifying, combining, and ameliorating the known
techniques, although we propose some technical novelties for further enhancing
the performance of the popular Cross-Approximation Algorithms. They are highly
efficient empirically, and we prove that they are efficient for the average
input.
  We specify some narrow classes of hard inputs for which the presented
algorithms fail with high probability even when we randomize them, but we
narrow such classes further by means of preprocessing with new sparse and
structured multipliers.
  The average complexity estimates do not cover many realistic input classes,

these techniques promise to revolutionize biophotonics by enabling deep-tissue
non-invasive optical imaging, optogenetics, optical tweezers and photodynamic

field was well-sampled during wavefront measurement and wavefront
reconstruction, following the Nyquist sampling criterion. Here, we overturn
this conventional practice by demonstrating that even when the scattered field
is under-sampled, light can still be focused through or inside opaque media.
Even more surprisingly, we show both theoretically and experimentally that the
focus achieved by under-sampling is usually about one order of magnitude
brighter than that achieved by conventional well-sampling conditions. Moreover,
sub-Nyquist sampling improves the signal-to-noise ratio and the collection
efficiency of the scattered light. We anticipate that this newly explored
under-sampling scheme will transform the understanding of optical time reversal
and boost the performance of optical imaging, manipulation, and communication

transformations between musical objects, Klumpenhouwer networks (K-Nets)
constitute a useful framework with connections in both group theory and graph
theory. Recent attempts at formalizing K-Nets in their most general form have
evidenced a deeper connection with category theory. These formalizations use
diagrams in sets, i.e. functors $\mathbf{C} \to \mathbf{Sets}$ where
$\mathbf{C}$ is often a small category, providing a general framework for the
known group or monoid actions on musical objects. However, following the work
of Douthett and Cohn, transformational music theory has also relied on the use
of relations between sets of the musical elements. Thus, K-Net formalizations
have to be further extended to take this aspect into account. This work
proposes a new framework called relational PK-Nets, an extension of our
previous work on Poly-Klumpenhouwer networks (PK-Nets), in which we consider
diagrams in $\mathbf{Rel}$ rather than $\mathbf{Sets}$. We illustrate the
potential of relational PK-Nets with selected examples, by analyzing pop music

not-trivial, due to the large number of Plankian ERB's that define homotopy
