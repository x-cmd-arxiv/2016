around bright stars, yet for three-quarters of the fields observed the temporal
coverage will limit discoveries to planets with orbital periods below 13.7
days. From the Kepler catalog, the mean probability of these short-period
transiting planets having additional longer period transiters (which would be
missed by TESS) is 18%, a value ten times higher than the average star. In this
work, we show how this probability is not uniform but functionally dependent
upon the properties of the observed short-period transiters, ranging from less
than 1% up to over 50%. Using artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on the
Kepler catalog and making careful feature selection to account for the
differing sensitivity of TESS, we are able to predict the most likely
short-period transiters to be accompanied by additional transiters. Through
cross-validation, we predict that a targeted, optimized TESS transit and/or
radial velocity follow-up program using our trained ANN would have a discovery
yield improved by a factor of two. Our work enables a near-optimal follow-up
strategy for surveys following TESS targets for additional planets, improving
the science yield derived from TESS and particularly beneficial in the search
for habitable-zone transiting worlds.

magnitude outliers, shape outliers are often masked among the rest of samples
and harder to identify. We show that the proposed total variation depth has
many desirable features and is well suited for outlier detection. In

components that are associated with shape and magnitude outlyingness,

for outlier detection and useful visualization tools, while naturally
accounting for the correlation in functional data. Finally, the proposed
methodology is demonstrated using real datasets of curves, images, and video

labels are used as input to train a classifier, in order to assign labels to
unclassified samples. In this paper, we study this classifier learning problem
from a graph signal processing (GSP) perspective. Specifically, by viewing a
binary classifier as a piecewise constant graph-signal in a high-dimensional
feature space, we cast classifier learning as a signal restoration problem via
a classical maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation. Unlike previous
graph-signal restoration works, we consider in addition edges with negative
weights that signify anti-correlation between samples. One unfortunate
consequence is that the graph Laplacian matrix $\mathbf{L}$ can be indefinite,
and previously proposed graph-signal smoothness prior $\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{L}
\mathbf{x}$ for candidate signal $\mathbf{x}$ can lead to pathological
solutions. In response, we derive an optimal perturbation matrix
$\boldsymbol{\Delta}$ - based on a fast lower-bound computation of the minimum
eigenvalue of $\mathbf{L}$ via a novel application of the Haynsworth inertia
additivity formula---so that $\mathbf{L} + \boldsymbol{\Delta}$ is positive
semi-definite, resulting in a stable signal prior. Further, instead of forcing
a hard binary decision for each sample, we define the notion of generalized
smoothness on graph that promotes ambiguity in the classifier signal. Finally,
we propose an algorithm based on iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) that
solves the posed MAP problem efficiently. Extensive simulation results show

growth of the radiation power beyond the initial saturation. One notable method
is undulator tapering, which involves the variation of the gap height and/or
the period along the undulator. Another method is the introduction of phase
jumps, using phase-shifting chicanes in the drift sections separating the
undulator segments. In this article, we develop a physics model of this phase
jump method, and verify it with numerical simulations. The model elucidates the
energy extraction process in the longitudinal phase space. The main ingredient
is the microbunch deceleration cycle, which enables the microbunched electron
beam to decelerate and radiate coherently beyond the initial saturation. The
ponderomotive bucket is stationary, and energy can even be extracted from
electrons outside the bucket. The model addresses the selection criteria for
the phase jump values, and the requirement on the undulator segment length. It
also describes the mechanism of the final saturation. In addition, we discuss
the similarities and differences between the phase jump method and undulator
tapering, by comparing our phase jump model to the classic
Kroll-Morton-Rosenbluth model.

To extend the Charney-Phillips grid staggering in the compatible finite element

space. For the time discretisation, we solve the semi-implicit equations
together with an explicit strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta scheme to all

analysis based on the semi-geostrophic theory shows that the model solutions
are converging to a solution in cross-front geostrophic balance. The results
are consistent with the previous results using finite difference methods,
indicating that the compatible finite element method is performing as well as
finite difference methods for this test problem. We observe dissipation of
kinetic energy of the cross-front velocity in the model due to the lack of
resolution at the fronts, even though the energy loss is not likely to account
for the large gap on the strength of the fronts between the model result and

the ion track kinetics, e.g. those calculated taking into account optical
phonons in the CDF form vs. Mott's atomic cross sections. (c) It is
demonstrated that the kinetics of valence holes significantly affects

great deal of attention in geometric representation theory because of
Feigin-Frenkel's duality theorem for them, which identifies W-algebras for a
Lie algebra and its Langlands dual through a subtle construction.
  The main result of this paper is an affine version of Skryabin's theorem,
describing the category of modules over the W-algebra in simpler categorical
terms. But unlike the classical story, it is essential to work with derived
categories in the affine setting.
  One novel feature is the use of geometric techniques to study W-algebras: the
theory of D-modules on the loop group and the geometry of the affine
Grassmannian are indispensable tools. These are used to give an infinite family
of affine analogues of the Bezrukavnikov-Braverman-Mirkovic theorem, providing
a geometric version of Rodier's compact approximation to the Whittaker model
from the arithmetic setting. We also use these methods to generalize Beraldo's
theorem identifying Whittaker invariants and Whittaker coinvariants, extending
his result from GL_n to a general reductive group. At integral level, these
methods seem to have deep intrinsic meaning in the local geometric Langlands
program.

and crossing of the energy levels, the ground state for the two-electron model
switches from one anti-crossing state for strong confinement to a crossing
state for intermediate confinement as the channel width is first increased, and
then returned to its original anti-crossing state. This switching behavior is
related to the triplet spin degeneracy as well as the Coulomb repulsion and
reflected in the ballistic conductance. Here, many-body effects can still
affect electron occupations in the calculation of quantum ballistic conductance
although it cannot vary the center-of-mass velocity.

in hardware design. SAT-based model checking techniques such as IC3/PDR, have
gained a significant success in hardware industry. In this paper, we present a
new framework for SAT-based safety model checking, named Complementary
Approximate Reachability (CAR). CAR is based on standard reachability analysis,
but instead of maintaining a single sequence of reachable- state sets, CAR
maintains two sequences of over- and under- approximate reachable-state sets,
checking safety and unsafety at the same time. To construct the two sequences,
CAR uses standard Boolean-reasoning algorithms, based on satisfiability
solving, one to find a satisfying cube of a satisfiable Boolean formula, and
one to provide a minimal unsatisfiable core of an unsatisfiable Boolean
formula. We applied CAR to 548 hardware model-checking instances, and compared
its performance with IC3/PDR. Our results show that CAR is able to solve 42
instances that cannot be solved by IC3/PDR. When evaluated against a portfolio
that includes IC3/PDR and other approaches, CAR is able to solve 21 instances
that the other approaches cannot solve. We conclude that CAR should be
considered as a valuable member of any algorithmic portfolio for safety model
checking.

removal. First stage of the algorithm eliminates non-upcalls by an energy
detection algorithm. In the second stage, two sets of features are extracted
from the remaining signals using contour-based and texture based methods. The
former is based on extraction of time-frequency features from upcall contours,
and the latter employs a Local Binary Pattern operator to extract
distinguishing texture features of the upcalls. Subsequently evaluation phase
is carried out by using several classifiers to assess the effectiveness of both
the contour-based and texture-based features for upcall detection. Experimental

surface energy on this arrangement were observed. It was seen that polar groups
(such as CN, CO) are more attracted to the coating surface due to the stronger
polar interactions. This results in a segregation of these groups to the
DLC-protein interface; at increasing takeoff angle (further from to DLC-protein
interface) fewer of these polar groups are seen. Correspondingly, groups that
interact mainly by dispersive forces (CC, CH) were found to increase in
intensity as takeoff angle increased, indicating they are segregated away from
the DLC-protein interface. The magnitude of the segregation was seen to
increase with increasing polar surface energy, this was attributed to an
increased net attraction between the solid surface and polar groups at higher
polar surface energy.

consists of plasma from the hot, closed-field corona that is released onto open

proposes that photospheric motions, at the scale of supergranules, are
responsible for generating dynamics at coronal-hole boundaries, which result in
the closed plasma release. We use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D
MHD) simulations to determine the effect of photospheric flows on the open and
closed magnetic flux of a model corona with a dipole magnetic field and an
isothermal solar wind. A rotational surface motion is used to approximate
photospheric supergranular driving and is applied at the boundary between the
coronal hole and helmet streamer. The resulting dynamics consist primarily of
prolific and efficient interchange reconnection between open and closed flux.
Magnetic flux near the coronal-hole boundary experiences multiple interchange
events, with some flux interchanging over fifty times in one day. Additionally,
we find that the interchange reconnection occurs all along the coronal-hole
boundary, even producing a lasting change in magnetic-field connectivity in
regions that were not driven by the applied motions. Our results show that
these dynamics should be ubiquitous in the Sun and heliosphere. We discuss the
implications of our simulations for understanding the observed properties of
the slow solar wind, with particular focus on the global-scale consequences of
interchange reconnection.

concentrate on validating specific methods or on single companies or countries.
Therefore, they allow only for limited empirical generalisations. Objective: To
lay an empirical and generalisable foundation about the state of the practice
in RE, we aim at a series of open and reproducible surveys that allow us to
steer future research in a problem-driven manner. Method: We designed a
globally distributed family of surveys in joint collaborations with different
researchers from different countries. The instrument is based on an initial
theory inferred from available studies. As a long-term goal, the survey will be
regularly replicated to manifest a clear understanding on the status quo and
practical needs in RE. In this paper, we present the design of the family of
surveys and first results of its start in Germany. Results: Our first results
contain responses from 30 German companies. The results are not yet
generalisable, but already indicate several trends and problems. For instance,
a commonly stated problem respondents see in their company standards are
artefacts being underrepresented, and important problems they experience in
their projects are incomplete and inconsistent requirements. Conclusion: The
results suggest that the survey design and instrument are well-suited to be
replicated and, thereby, to create a generalisable empirical basis of RE in
practice.

switching field of the islands at the lower and higher ends of the switching

extrapolated the switching field and energy barrier down to 0K. The

measured for the exclusive $\pi^0$ electroproduction reaction $\gamma^* p \to p

same experiment. The results were obtained from scattering of 6 GeV
longitudinally polarized electrons off longitudinally polarized protons using
the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer at Jefferson Lab. The kinematic range
covered is $1.1<W<3$ GeV and $1<Q^2<6$ GeV$^2$. Results were obtained for about
5700 bins in $W$, $Q^2$, \cthcm, and $\phi^*$. The beam-target asymmetries were
found to generally be greater than zero, with relatively modest \phicmsp
dependence. The target asymmetries exhibit very strong \phicmsp dependence,
with a change in sign occurring between results at low $W$ and high $W$, in
contrast to $\pi^+$ electroproduction. Reasonable agreement is found with
phenomenological fits to previous data for $W<1.6$ GeV, but significant
differences are seen at higher $W$. When combined with cross section
measurements, as well as $\pi^+$ observables, the present results will provide
powerful constraints on nucleon resonance amplitudes at moderate and large

  We show that probably the best choice for the familiy of subsets of $[0,1]$
is the Borel $\sigma$-algebra and for the set-function any `sliceable' Borel
measure. At least in dimension one it does not make sense to work with only
finitely additive contents on finite unions of intervals. For the continuity
property we see two possibilities. The weaker is the traditional divisibility
property, which is equivalent to being atom-free. The stronger is simply
absolute continuity with respect to Lebesgue measure. We also consider the case
of a base set (cake or pie) more general than $[0,1]$.

demonstrated a suppression in the background rate of over 50% for the range of

spectrograph, is a Stage-IV ground-based dark energy experiment aiming to
measure redshifts for 29 million Emission-Line Galaxies (ELG), 4 million
Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG), and 2 million Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSO). The
survey design includes a pattern of tiling on the sky and the locations of the
fiber positioners in the focal plane of the telescope, with the observation
strategy determined by a fiber assignment algorithm that optimizes the
allocation of fibers to targets. This strategy allows a given region to be
covered on average five times for a five-year survey, but with coverage varying
between zero and twelve, which imprints a spatially-dependent pattern on the
galaxy clustering. We investigate the systematic effects of the fiber
assignment coverage on the anisotropic galaxy clustering of ELGs and show that,
in the absence of any corrections, it leads to discrepancies of order ten
percent on large scales for the power spectrum multipoles. We introduce a
method where objects in a random catalog are assigned a coverage, and the mean
density is separately computed for each coverage factor. We show that this
method reduces, but does not eliminate the effect. We next investigate the
angular dependence of the contaminated signal, arguing that it is mostly
localized to purely transverse modes. We demonstrate that the cleanest way to
remove the contaminating signal is to perform an analysis of the anisotropic
power spectrum $P(k,\mu)$ and remove the lowest $\mu$ bin, leaving $\mu>0$
modes accurate at the few-percent level. Here, $\mu$ is the cosine of the angle
between the line-of-sight and the direction of $\vec{k}$. We also investigate
two alternative definitions of the random catalog and show they are comparable
but less effective than the coverage randoms method.

topics have been developed under the premise that there exist anchor words --
i.e., words that only appear (with positive probability) in one topic.
Follow-up work has resorted to three or higher-order statistics of the data
corpus to relax the anchor word assumption. Reliable estimates of higher-order
statistics are hard to obtain, however, and the identification of topics under
those models hinges on uncorrelatedness of the topics, which can be
unrealistic. This paper revisits topic modeling based on second-order moments,
and proposes an anchor-free topic mining framework. The proposed approach
guarantees the identification of the topics under a much milder condition
compared to the anchor-word assumption, thereby exhibiting much better
robustness in practice. The associated algorithm only involves one
eigen-decomposition and a few small linear programs. This makes it easy to
implement and scale up to very large problem instances. Experiments using the
TDT2 and Reuters-21578 corpus demonstrate that the proposed anchor-free
approach exhibits very favorable performance (measured using coherence,
similarity count, and clustering accuracy metrics) compared to the prior art.

prove that Lemke's algorithm can be applied, showing that computing an EFPE is

physical properties of isolated, synthetic quantum systems. However, due to the
lack of energy conservation and heating effects, non-trivial (e.g.,
topological) many-body states in periodically driven (Floquet) systems are
generally metastable. Therefore it is necessary to find strategies for
preparing long-lived many-body states in Floquet systems. We develop a
theoretical framework for describing the dynamical preparation of states in
Floquet systems by a slow turn-on of the drive. We find that the dynamics of
the system is well approximated by the initial state evolving under a slowly
varying effective Hamiltonian $H_{\rm eff}^{(s)}(t)$, provided the ramp speed
$s \gg t_*^{-1} \sim e^{-{\mathcal{C} \frac{\omega}{J}}}$, the inverse of the
characteristic heating time-scale in the Floquet system. At such ramp speeds,
the heating effects due to the drive are exponentially suppressed. We compute
the slowly varying effective Hamiltonian $H_{\rm eff}^{(s)}(t)$, and show that
at the end of the ramp it is identical to the effective Hamiltonian of the
unramped Floquet system, up to small corrections of the order $O(s)$.
Therefore, the system effectively undergoes a slow quench from $H_0$ to $H_{\rm
eff}$. As an application, we consider the passage of the slow quench through a
quantum critical point (QCP), and estimate the energy absorbed due to the
non-adiabatic passage through the QCP via a Kibble-Zurek mechanism. By
minimizing the energy absorbed due to both the drive and the ramp, we find an
optimal ramp speed $s_* \sim t_*^{-z/({d+2z})}$ for which both heating effects
are exponentially suppressed. Our results bridge the gap between the numerous
proposals to obtain interesting systems via Floquet engineering, and the actual
preparation of such systems in their effective ground states.

generate luminous GeV-TeV emission lasting from minutes to several hours. The
high-energy emission results from inverse Compton upscattering of prompt and
afterglow photons by shock-heated {\it thermal} plasma. At its peak the
high-energy radiation carries a significant fraction of the power dissipated at
the forward shock. We discuss in detail the expected TeV luminosity, using a
robust ""minimal"" emission model. Then, using the statistical properties of the
GRB population (luminosity function, redshift distribution, afterglow energy)
we simulate the expected detection rates of GRBs by current and upcoming
atmospheric Cherenkov instruments. We find that GRBs exploding into a
low-density interstellar medium must produce TeV emission that would have
already been detected by the currently operating Cherenkov telescopes. The
absence of detections is consistent with explosions into a dense wind of the
GRB progenitor. If the typical environment of long GRBs is a Wolf-Rayet
progenitor wind, as suggested by the recent analysis of Fermi LAT data, then
the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) should be able to detect a
fraction of GRBs that trigger the space-borne detectors. Since absorption by
the extragalactic background light limits the detectability above 0.1 TeV for
all but the most nearby bursts ($z\lesssim 1$), the reduced energy threshold of
CTA is the key improvement over current instruments, which should boost the
detection rate by at least a factor of 3.

introduced and studied in theories of TeV supersymmetry with a QCD axion, $a$,
and a high reheat temperature after inflation, $T_R$. A large overproduction of
axinos ($\tilde{a}$) and gravitinos ($\tilde{G}$) from scattering at $T_R$, and
from freeze-in at the TeV scale, is diluted by the late decay of a saxion
condensate that arises from inflation. The two lightest superpartners are
$\tilde{a}$, with mass of order the TeV scale, and $\tilde{G}$ with mass
$m_{3/2}$ anywhere between the keV and TeV scales, depending on the mediation
scale of supersymmetry breaking. Dark matter contains both warm and cold
components: for $\tilde{G}$ LSP the warm component arises from $\tilde{a}
\rightarrow \tilde{G}a$, while for $\tilde{a}$ LSP the warm component arises
from $\tilde{G} \rightarrow \tilde{a}a$. The free-streaming scale for the warm
component is predicted to be of order 1 Mpc (and independent of $m_{3/2}$ in
the case of $\tilde{G}$ LSP). $T_R$ can be as high as $10^{16}$ GeV, for any
value of $m_{3/2}$, solving the gravitino problem. The PQ symmetry breaking
scale $V_{PQ}$ depends on $T_R$ and $m_{3/2}$ and can be anywhere in the range
$(10^{10} - 10^{16})$ GeV. Detailed predictions are made for the lifetime of
the neutralino LOSP decaying to $\tilde{a}+ h/Z$ and $\tilde{G}+h/Z/\gamma$,
which is in the range of $(10^{-1}-10^6)$m over much of parameter space. For an
axion misalignment angle of order unity, the axion contribution to dark matter
is sub-dominant, except when $V_{PQ}$ approaches $10^{16}$ GeV.

use GALFIT and an artificial redshifting technique, which includes the

the measured structural parameters with redshift. We find typical sizes of 2 to
3 kpc and Sersic indices of n~1.2, close to pure exponential disks all the way
from z=2.23 to z=0.4. At z=0 we find typical sizes of 4-5 kpc. Our results show
that, when using GALFIT, cosmological dimming has a negligible impact on the
derived effective radius for galaxies with <10 kpc, but we find a ~20% bias on
the estimate of the median Sersic indices, rendering galaxies more disk-like.
Star-forming galaxies have grown on average by a factor of 2-3 in the last 11

paradigm. The model is unique in a sense that the observed ratio $\Omega_{\rm

its natural explanation as a result of their common QCD origin when both types
of matter (DM and visible) are formed during the QCD transition and both are
proportional to single dimensional parameter of the system, $\Lambda_{\rm
QCD}$. We argue that the charge separation effect also inevitably occurs during
the same QCD transition in the presence of the $\cal{CP}$ odd axion field
$a(x)$. It leads to preferential formation of one species of nuggets on the
scales of the visible Universe where the axion field $a(x)$ is coherent. A
natural outcome of this preferential evolution is that only one type of the
visible baryons (not anti- baryons) remain in the system after the nuggets
complete their formation. Unlike conventional WIMP dark matter candidates, the
nuggets and anti-nuggets are strongly interacting but macroscopically large
objects. The rare events of annihilation of the anti-nuggets with visible
matter lead to a number of observable effects. We argue that the relative
intensities for a number of measured excesses of emission from the centre of
galaxy (covering more than 11 orders of magnitude) are determined by standard
and well established physics. At the same time the absolute intensity of
emission is determined by a single new fundamental parameter of the theory, the
axion mass, $10^{-6} {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-3}{\rm eV}$. Finally,
we comment on implications of these studies for the axion search experiments,

flare events with GOES levels of >=M5.0 within 45 deg from disk center between
May 2010 and April 2016. These criteria lead to a total of 51 flares from 29
ARs, for which we analyze the observational data obtained by the Solar Dynamics
Observatory. More than 80% of the 29 ARs are found to exhibit delta-sunspots
and at least three ARs violate Hale's polarity rule. The flare durations are
approximately proportional to the distance between the two flare ribbons, to
the total magnetic flux inside the ribbons, and to the ribbon area. From our
study, one of the parameters that clearly determine whether a given flare event
is CME-eruptive or not is the ribbon area normalized by the sunspot area, which
may indicate that the structural relationship between the flaring region and
the entire AR controls CME productivity. AR characterization show that even
X-class events do not require delta-sunspots or strong-field, high-gradient
polarity inversion lines. An investigation of historical observational data
suggests the possibility that the largest solar ARs, with magnetic flux of
2x10^23 Mx, might be able to produce ""superflares"" with energies of order of
10^34 erg. The proportionality between the flare durations and magnetic
energies is consistent with stellar flare observations, suggesting a common
physical background for solar and stellar flares.

This model successfully reproduces dark matter with direct detection mediated

dispersion of $6.9^{+1.2}_{-0.9}~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Assuming that Eri~II is
a dispersion-supported system in dynamical equilibrium, we derive a mass within
the half-light radius of Eri II is $1.2^{+0.4}_{-0.3} \times

$420^{+210}_{-140}~\mathrm{M_\odot}/\mathrm{L_\odot}$ and confirming that it is
a dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxy. From the equivalent width measurements of
the CaT lines of 16 red giant member stars, we derive a mean metallicity of
${\rm [Fe/H]} = -2.38 \pm 0.13$ and a metallicity dispersion of $\sigma_{\rm

Standard of Rest frame is $v_{\rm GSR} = -66.6~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, indicating
that either Eri II is falling into the Milky Way potential for the first time

Galactocentric distance of $\sim$370 kpc, Eri II is one of the Milky Way's most
distant satellites known. Additionally, we show that the bright blue stars
previously suggested to be a young stellar population are not associated with
Eri II. The lack of gas and recent star formation in Eri II is surprising given
its mass and distance from the Milky Way, and may place constraints on models
of quenching in dwarf galaxies and on the distribution of hot gas in the Milky
Way halo. Furthermore, the large velocity dispersion of Eri II can be combined
with the existence of a central star cluster to constrain MACHO dark matter

is a key to many computer vision and graphics applications, such as motion
capture and reenactment. The reconstruction task is challenging as human faces
vary extensively when considering expressions, poses, textures, and intrinsic
geometries. While many approaches tackle this complexity by using additional
data to reconstruct the face of a single subject, extracting facial surface
from a single image remains a difficult problem. As a result, single-image
based methods can usually provide only a rough estimate of the facial geometry.
In contrast, we propose to leverage the power of convolutional neural networks
to produce a highly detailed face reconstruction from a single image. For this
purpose, we introduce an end-to-end CNN framework which derives the shape in a
coarse-to-fine fashion. The proposed architecture is composed of two main
blocks, a network that recovers the coarse facial geometry (CoarseNet),
followed by a CNN that refines the facial features of that geometry (FineNet).
The proposed networks are connected by a novel layer which renders a depth
image given a mesh in 3D. Unlike object recognition and detection problems,
there are no suitable datasets for training CNNs to perform face geometry
reconstruction. Therefore, our training regime begins with a supervised phase,
based on synthetic images, followed by an unsupervised phase that uses only
unconstrained facial images. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed model
is demonstrated by both qualitative and quantitative evaluation tests.

channel model that consists of two fluctuating specular components with random
phases plus a diffuse component. The FTR model arises as the natural
generalization of the two-wave with diffuse power (TWDP) fading model; this
generalization allows its two specular components to exhibit a random amplitude
fluctuation. Unlike the TWDP model, all the chief probability functions of the
FTR fading model (PDF, CDF and MGF) are expressed in closed-form, having a
functional form similar to other state-of-the-art fading models. We also
provide approximate closed-form expressions for the PDF and CDF in terms of a
finite number of elementary functions, which allow for a simple evaluation of
these statistics to an arbitrary level of precision. We show that the FTR

Finally, the performance of wireless communication systems over FTR fading is
evaluated in terms of the bit error rate and the outage capacity, and the
interplay between the FTR fading model parameters and the system performance is
discussed. Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out in order to validate
the obtained theoretical expressions.

observed clustering measurements from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA)

partly due to limited numerical resolution. Apart from this limitation, we

the Global and Modular BSM Inference Tool. GAMBIT is a flexible and extensible
framework for global fits of essentially any BSM theory. The code currently
incorporates direct and indirect searches for dark matter, limits on production
of new particles from the LHC and LEP, complete flavor constraints from LHCb,
LHC Higgs production and decay measurements, and various electroweak precision
observables. Here we present an overview of the code's capabilities, followed
by preliminary results from scans of the scalar singlet dark matter model.

message passing algorithm. The kind of message passing algorithms used for CVM,
usually named Generalized Belief Propagation, are a generalization of the
Belief Propagation algorithm in the same way that CVM is a generalization of
the Bethe approximation for estimating the partition function. However, the
connection between fixed points of GBP and the extremal points of the CVM
free-energy is usually not a one-to-one correspondence, because of the
existence of a gauge transformation involving the GBP messages.
  Our contribution is twofold. Firstly we propose a new way of defining
messages (fields) in a generic CVM approximation, such that messages arrive on
a given region from all its ancestors, and not only from its direct parents, as
in the standard Parent-to-Child GBP. We call this approach maximal messages.
Secondly we focus on the case of binary variables, re-interpreting the messages
as fields enforcing the consistency between the moments of the local (marginal)
probability distributions. We provide a precise rule to enforce all
consistencies, avoiding any redundancy, that would otherwise lead to a gauge
transformation on the messages. This moment matching method is gauge free, i.e.
it guarantees that the resulting GBP is not gauge invariant.
  We apply our maximal messages and moment matching GBP to obtain an analytical
expression for the critical temperature of the Ising model in general
dimensions at the level of plaquette-CVM. The values obtained outperform Bethe
estimates, and are comparable with loop corrected Belief Propagation equations.
The method allows for a straightforward generalization to disordered systems.

the energy range of quasi-elastic scattering. In particular, the study focuses
on the neutral-current elastic (anti)neutrino scattering off nucleons described
by the exotic reactions $\nu_\alpha ({\bar \nu}_\alpha) + n \rightarrow
\nu_\beta ({\bar \nu}_\beta) + n $ and $ \nu_\alpha ({\bar \nu}_\alpha) + p
\rightarrow \nu_\beta ({\bar \nu}_\beta) + p$, which provide corrections to the
dominant Standard Model processes. In this context, it is shown that the
required exotic nucleon form factors may have a significant impact on the
relevant cross sections. Besides cross sections, the event rate is expected to
be rather sensitive to the magnitude of the lepton-flavour violating parameters
resulting in an excess of events. The overlap of non-standard interactions and
strange quark contributions, in the region of few GeV neutrino energies, is
also examined. The formalism is applied for the case of the relevant
neutrino-nucleon scattering experiments (LSND, MiniBooNE, etc.) and motivates
the notion that such facilities have high potential to probe NSI.

mostly remained inaccessible to the technique of asteroseismology, despite
several attempts carried out in the past.
  Aims. We re-assess the potential of asteroseismology for probing the chemical
stratification in white dwarf cores, in light of new highly efficient tools
recently developed for that purpose.
  Methods. Using the forward modeling approach and a new parameterization for
the core chemical stratification in ZZ Ceti stars, we test several situations
typical of the usually limited constraints available, such as small numbers of
observed independent modes, to carry out asteroseismology of these stars.
  Results. We find that, even with a limited number of modes, the core chemical
stratification (in particular, the location of the steep chemical transitions
expected in the oxygen profile) can be determined quite precisely due to the
significant sensitivity of some confined modes to partial reflexion (trapping)
effects. These effects are similar to the well known trapping induced by the
shallower chemical transitions at the edge of the core and at the bottom of the
H-rich envelope. We also find that success to unravel the core structure
depends on the information content of the available seismic data. In some
cases, it may not be possible to isolate a unique, well-defined seismic
solution and the problem remains degenerate.
  Conclusions. Our results establish that constraining the core chemical
stratification in white dwarf stars based solely on asteroseismology is
possible, an opportunity that we have started to exploit.

may appear in the color-flavor locked (CFL) phase, which is a superfluid. This
phase features topologically stable vortex solutions, which arise in a spinning
superfluid as localized configurations carrying quanta of angular momentum.
Despite the topological stability of these vortices they are not the lowest
energy state of the system at neutron star densities and decay into triplets of
semi-superfluid fluxtubes. In these proceedings we report on the progress of
our numerical study in the Ginzburg-Landau approach, where we investigate
lattices of semi-superfluid fluxtubes. The fluxtubes are obtained through
controlled decay of global vortex configurations in the presence of a gauge
field. Understanding the dynamics of semi-superfluid string configurations is
important in the context of angular momentum transfer from a quark matter core
of a neutron star beyond the core boundary, since not vortex-, but fluxtube
pinning seems to be the relevant mechanism in this scenario.

properties which are usually fixed in magnets. Here we address the possibility
to dynamically control their intrinsic magnetic interactions by varying the
strength of a high-frequency laser field. It is shown that drastic changes can
be induced in the antiferromagnetic exchange interactions and the latter can
even be reversed to become ferromagnetic, provided the direct exchange is
already non-negligible in equilibrium as predicted, for example, in Si doped
with C, Sn, or Pb adatoms. In the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions, this enables us to tune features of ferromagnetic Skyrmions such
as their radius, making them easier to stabilize. Alternatively, such
topological spin textures can occur in frustrated triangular lattices. Then, we
demonstrate that a high-frequency laser field can induce dynamical frustration
in antiferromagnets, where the degree of frustration can subsequently be tuned
suitably to drive the material toward a Skyrmionic phase.

engineering neural prosthetics require assessing two problems, namely encoding
and decoding, but their relation remains controversial. For decades, the
encoding problem has been shown to provide insight into the decoding problem,
for example, by upper bounding the decoded information. However, here we show
that this need not be the case when studying response aspects beyond noise
correlations, and trace back the actual causes of this major departure from
traditional views. To that end, we reformulate the encoding and decoding
problems from the observer or organism perspective. In addition, we study the
role of spike-time precision and response discrimination, among other response
aspects, using stochastic transformations of the neural responses, here called
stochastic codes. Our results show that stochastic codes may cause different
information losses when used to describe neural responses and when employed to
train optimal decoders. Therefore, we conclude that response aspects beyond
noise correlations may play different roles in encoding and decoding. In
practice, our results show for the first time that decoders constructed
low-quality descriptions of response aspects may operate optimally on
high-quality descriptions and vice versa, thereby potentially yielding
experimental and computational savings, as well as new opportunities for
simplifying the design of computational brain models and neural prosthetics.

from Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) are emerging as powerful tools in
computational biology. However the underlying assumptions of the relationship
between the inferred effective Potts Hamiltonian and real protein structure and
energetics remain untested so far. Here we use lattice protein model (LP) to
benchmark those inverse statistical approaches. We build MSA of highly stable
sequences in target LP structures, and infer the effective pairwise Potts
Hamiltonians from those MSA. We find that inferred Potts Hamiltonians reproduce
many important aspects of 'true' LP structures and energetics. Careful analysis
reveals that effective pairwise couplings in inferred Potts Hamiltonians depend
not only on the energetics of the native structure but also on competing folds;
in particular, the coupling values reflect both positive design (stabilization
of native conformation) and negative design (destabilization of competing
folds). In addition to providing detailed structural information, the inferred
Potts models used as protein Hamiltonian for design of new sequences are able
to generate with high probability completely new sequences with the desired
folds, which is not possible using independent-site models. Those are
remarkable results as the effective LP Hamiltonians used to generate MSA are
not simple pairwise models due to the competition between the folds. Our
findings elucidate the reasons for the success of inverse approaches to the
modelling of proteins from sequence data, and their limitations.

from (quasi-)adiabatic to non-adiabatic dynamical behavior when the spin bath
coupling increases. We also investigate the particular regime $H/\omega_c \ll
v/H \ll 1$, where the dynamical Chern number observable built from
out-of-equilibrium spin expectation values vanishes at $\alpha=1/2$. In this
regime, the mapping to an interacting resonance level model enables us to
characterize the evolution of the dynamical Chern number in the vicinity of
$\alpha=1/2$. Then, we provide an intuitive physical explanation of the
breakdown of adiabaticity in analogy to the Faraday effect in electromagnetism.
We demonstrate that the driving of the spin leads to the production of a large

minimal extension of sequence alignment to labelled directed acyclic graphs
(labeled DAGs). Namely, we show that finding a \emph{covering alignment} of two
labeled DAGs is NP-hard even on binary alphabets. A covering alignment asks for
two paths $R_1$ (red) and $G_1$ (green) in DAG $D_1$ and two paths $R_2$ (red)

Pair-wise alignment of haplotype sequences forming a diploid chromosome can be
converted to a two-path coverable labelled DAG, and then the covering alignment
models the similarity of two diploids over arbitrary recombinations. We also
give a reduction to the other direction, to show that such a

data. In some cases, we initialize the optimizer with human demonstrations
collected via teleoperation in a virtual environment. We demonstrate that such
controllers can perform the task robustly, both in simulation and on the

a wider range of initial conditions: deep learning, and nearest neighbors. We
find that nearest neighbors achieve higher performance. Nevertheless, the
neural network has its advantages: it uses only tactile and proprioceptive
feedback but no visual feedback about the object (i.e. it performs the task
blind) and learns a time-invariant policy. In contrast, the nearest neighbors
method switches between time-varying local controllers based on the proximity
of initial object states sensed via motion capture. While both generalization
methods leave room for improvement, our work shows that (i) local
trajectory-based controllers for complex non-prehensile manipulation tasks can
be constructed from surprisingly small amounts of training data, and (ii)

years, many improvements and variations have been proposed for deep sequence
models in general, and LSTMs in particular. We propose and analyze a series of
augmentations and modifications to LSTM networks resulting in improved
performance for text classification datasets. We observe compounding
improvements on traditional LSTMs using Monte Carlo test-time model averaging,
average pooling, and residual connections, along with four other suggested
modifications. Our analysis provides a simple, reliable, and high quality

this paper we explore the idea that ""well-typed languages are sound"": the idea
that the appropriate typing discipline over language specifications guarantees
that the language is type sound. We instantiate this idea for a certain class
of languages defined using small step operational semantics by ensuring the
progress and preservation theorems. Our first contribution is a syntactic
discipline for organizing and restricting language specifications so that they
automatically satisfy the progress theorem. This discipline is not novel but
makes explicit the way expert language designers have been organizing a certain
class of languages for long time. We give a formal account of this discipline
by representing language specifications as (higher-order) logic programs and by
giving a meta type system over that collection of formulas. Our second
contribution is a methodology and meta type system for guaranteeing that
languages satisfy the preservation theorem. Ultimately, we proved that language
specifications that conform to our meta type systems are guaranteed to be type
sound. We have implemented these ideas in the TypeSoundnessCertifier, a tool
that takes language specifications in the form of logic programs and type
checks them according to our meta type systems. For those languages that pass
our type checker, our tool automatically produces a proof of type soundness
that can be machine-checked by the Abella proof assistant. For those languages
that fail our type checker, the tool pinpoints the design mistakes that hinder
type soundness. We have applied the TypeSoundnessCertifier to a large number of
programming languages, including those with recursive types, polymorphism,
letrec, exceptions, lists and other common types and operators.

flows well constrained by observations, to simulate the evolution of the Sun's
polar magnetic fields from early 2016 to the end of 2019 --- near the expected
time of Cycle 24/25 minimum. We run a series of simulations in which the
uncertain conditions (convective motion details, active region tilt, and
meridional flow profile) are varied within expected ranges. We find that the
average strength of the polar fields near the end of Cycle 24 will be similar
to that measured near the end of Cycle 23, indicating that Cycle 25 will be
similar in strength to the current cycle. In all cases the polar fields are
asymmetric with fields in the south stronger than those in the north. This
asymmetry would be more pronounced if not for the predicted weakening of the
southern polar fields in late 2016 and through 2017. After just four years of
simulation the variability across our ensemble indicates an accumulated
uncertainty of about 15\%. This accumulated uncertainty arises from stochastic
variations in the convective motion details, the active region tilt, and
changes in the meridional flow profile. These variations limit the ultimate
predictability of the solar cycle.

bilinear feature has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of fine-grained classification tasks. To address the computational
demands of high feature dimensionality, we propose to represent the covariance
features as a matrix and apply a low-rank bilinear classifier. The resulting
classifier can be evaluated without explicitly computing the bilinear feature
map which allows for a large reduction in the compute time as well as
decreasing the effective number of parameters to be learned.
  To further compress the model, we propose classifier co-decomposition that
factorizes the collection of bilinear classifiers into a common factor and
compact per-class terms. The co-decomposition idea can be deployed through two
convolutional layers and trained in an end-to-end architecture. We suggest a
simple yet effective initialization that avoids explicitly first training and
factorizing the larger bilinear classifiers. Through extensive experiments, we
show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public
datasets for fine-grained classification trained with only category labels.
Importantly, our final model is an order of magnitude smaller than the recently
proposed compact bilinear model, and three orders smaller than the standard
bilinear CNN model.

marked enhancement in the permittivity of (Nb + In) co-doped TiO2 single

carriers are frozen out and exert no influence on the dielectric response. The
results indicate that the permittivity attains quadruple of that for pure TiO2.
This finding suggests that the electron-pinned defect-dipoles add an extra

Delay attacks are one of the most effective cyber attacks in PTP, as they

the case where the slave node can exchange synchronization messages with
multiple master nodes synchronized to the same clock. We first provide lower
bounds on the best achievable performance for any phase offset estimation
scheme in the presence of delay attacks. We then present a novel phase offset
estimation scheme that employs the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for
detecting which of the master-slave communication links have been subject to
delay attacks. After discarding information from the links identified as
attacked, which we show to be optimal, the optimal vector location parameter
estimator is employed to estimate the phase offset of the slave node.
Simulation results are presented to show that the proposed phase offset

actions through a process called ""closure"". While computers can now describe

ask models to predict narrative and character-centric aspects of a panel given

human baselines on these tasks, suggesting that COMICS contains fundamental
challenges for both vision and language.

in a non-inertial framework. The results show that EPR steering from Alice to
Bob is dramatically destroyed by Unruh effect caused by the acceleration of
Bob. Besides, EPR steering has an asymmetry property, and EPR steering
asymmetry increases with the growing intensity of Unruh effect, implying that
the Unruh effect can bring on EPR steering asymmetry. Furthermore, the reduced
physical accessible EPR steering from Alice to Bob is distributed to the
physical inaccessible EPR steering (from Alice to anti-Bob or from Bob to
anti-Bob). Notably, unlike entanglement and quantum discord, only one of EPR
steering from Alice to anti-Bob and Bob to anti-Bob experiences a sudden birth
with the increase of acceleration parameter, which means that they cannot
simultaneously survive. That is, the monogamy relation of EPR steering is still
tenable in such a scenario. Consequently, we believe that EPR steering could

$(\partial_t -i \Delta) u = Q(u, \bar{u})$. Different from nonlinearities of
the $uu$ type and the $\bar{u}\bar{u}$ type, which have been studied by
Germain-Masmoudi-Shatah, the interaction of $u$ and $\bar{u}$ is very strong at
the low frequency part, e.g., $1\times 1 \rightarrow 0$ type interaction (the
size of input frequency is ""$1$"" and the size of output frequency is ""$0$""). It
creates a growth mode for the Fourier transform of the profile of solution
around a small neighborhood of zero. This growth mode will again cause the
growth of profile in the medium frequency part due to the $1\times 0\rightarrow
1$ type interaction. The issue of strong $1\times 1\rightarrow 0$ type
interaction makes the global existence problem very delicate.
  In this paper, we show that, as long as there are ""$\epsilon$"" derivatives

small initial data. As a byproduct, we also give a simple proof for the almost

for evaluating Olympic sports which utilize spatiotemporal features learned

state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms. However, they are still rarely
deployed on battery-powered mobile devices, such as smartphones and wearable
gadgets, where vision algorithms can enable many revolutionary real-world
applications. The key limiting factor is the high energy consumption of CNN
processing due to its high computational complexity. While there are many
previous efforts that try to reduce the CNN model size or amount of
computation, we find that they do not necessarily result in lower energy
consumption, and therefore do not serve as a good metric for energy cost
estimation.
  To close the gap between CNN design and energy consumption optimization, we
propose an energy-aware pruning algorithm for CNNs that directly uses energy
consumption estimation of a CNN to guide the pruning process. The energy
estimation methodology uses parameters extrapolated from actual hardware
measurements that target realistic battery-powered system setups. The proposed
layer-by-layer pruning algorithm also prunes more aggressively than previously
proposed pruning methods by minimizing the error in output feature maps instead
of filter weights. For each layer, the weights are first pruned and then
locally fine-tuned with a closed-form least-square solution to quickly restore
the accuracy. After all layers are pruned, the entire network is further
globally fine-tuned using back-propagation. With the proposed pruning method,
the energy consumption of AlexNet and GoogLeNet are reduced by 3.7x and 1.6x,
respectively, with less than 1% top-5 accuracy loss. Finally, we show that
pruning the AlexNet with a reduced number of target classes can greatly
decrease the number of weights but the energy reduction is limited.

Bertoni et al. (2015, 2016). In this work we analyze the Fermi-LAT Pass 8 data

source. In order to suppress the possible contamination from two nearby
very-bright blazars, we just take into account the front-converting gamma-rays
which have better angular resolutions than that of the back-converting photons.
In addition to the spatial distribution analysis, we have extended the spectrum
analysis down to the energies of $\sim 100$ MeV, and thoroughly examined the
variability of the emission during the past 8 years. We confirm that 3FGL
J2212.5+0703 is a steady and spatially-extended gamma-ray emitter at a high

(CNNs) serve the dual purpose of providing increasingly abstract
representations as well as yielding computational savings in subsequent
convolutional layers. We view the pooling operation in CNNs as a two-step
procedure: first, a pooling window (e.g., $2\times 2$) slides over the feature
map with stride one which leaves the spatial resolution intact, and second,
downsampling is performed by selecting one pixel from each non-overlapping
pooling window in an often uniform and deterministic (e.g., top-left) manner.
Our starting point in this work is the observation that this regularly spaced
downsampling arising from non-overlapping windows, although intuitive from a
signal processing perspective (which has the goal of signal reconstruction), is
not necessarily optimal for \emph{learning} (where the goal is to generalize).
We study this aspect and propose a novel pooling strategy with stochastic
spatial sampling (S3Pool), where the regular downsampling is replaced by a more
general stochastic version. We observe that this general stochasticity acts as
a strong regularizer, and can also be seen as doing implicit data augmentation
by introducing distortions in the feature maps. We further introduce a
mechanism to control the amount of distortion to suit different datasets and
architectures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we
perform extensive experiments on several popular image classification
benchmarks, observing excellent improvements over baseline models. Experimental

region is induced by equal-spin triplet superconducting correlations in
superconductor ($S$) ferromagnet ($F$) heterostructure with noncollinear
magnetization. In this paper, we represent that in $NSF_1F_2$
($N$--normal-metal) spin-valve structure the induced magnetic moment emerging
in both the $S$ and $N$ regions can also be generated by Cooper pair splitting:
one electron coherently tunnels from the $S$ layer into the $F_1$ layer, and
the other one stays in the $S$ layer or tunnels into the $N$ layer. Two
electrons are spatially separated from each other but their total spin ground
state is entangled in this process. In contrast, the magnetic moment induced by
the equal-spin triplet correlations hardly penetrates from the $S$ layer into
the $N$ layer. In particular, by tuning the size of the exchange field and the
thickness of the $F_1$ layer, one may control the direction of the induced
magnetic moment in the $N$ layer. This interesting phenomenon can be attributed
to the phase-shift obtained by the spin-entangled electrons. Our theoretical
proposal will offer an effective way to control the entanglement of the
nonlocal electrons, and also may provide possible explanations for previous and
recent experimental observations [Stamopoulos et al 2005 Phys. Rev. B 72

From the investigation it was found that, hygrothermal ageing has detrimental

unsupervised generative clustering approach within the framework of Variational
Auto-Encoder (VAE). Specifically, VaDE models the data generative procedure
with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a deep neural network (DNN): 1) the GMM
picks a cluster; 2) from which a latent embedding is generated; 3) then the DNN
decodes the latent embedding into observables. Inference in VaDE is done in a
variational way: a different DNN is used to encode observables to latent
embeddings, so that the evidence lower bound (ELBO) can be optimized using
Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) estimator and the
reparameterization trick. Quantitative comparisons with strong baselines are
included in this paper, and experimental results show that VaDE significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art clustering methods on 4 benchmarks from
various modalities. Moreover, by VaDE's generative nature, we show its
capability of generating highly realistic samples for any specified cluster,
without using supervised information during training. Lastly, VaDE is a
flexible and extensible framework for unsupervised generative clustering, more
general mixture models than GMM can be easily plugged in.

  Toward this goal, we explore pre-processing techniques and modifications to

removes these degeneracies and accepts three parameters which directly describe
the output spectral shape: the energy of the peak of the accretion disk

presented as a function of the black hole mass, AGN luminosity, and `coronal
radius' of the {\sc optxagnf} model upon which {\sc oxaf} is based. We show
that the soft X-ray excess does not significantly affect photoionization
modeling predictions of strong emission lines in Seyfert narrow-line regions.
Despite its simplicity, {\sc oxaf} accounts for opacity effects where the
accretion disk is ionized because it inherits the `color correction' of {\sc
optxagnf}. We use a grid of {\sc mappings} photoionization models with {\sc

spin torque nano-oscillator (STNO) consists of at least one pinned layer (PL)
and one free layer (FL) which precesses in a fixed orbit, defined by a
precession angle, which results in magneto-resistance (MR) oscillations. In
STNO, with aligned or even orthogonal easy-axis of the magnetic layers and with
or without external bias magnetic field, it is not possible to attain full MR
swing. The constringed MR swing jeopardizes the extracted output power.
Furthermore, the orbit is strongly disturbed by the thermal fluctuations
resulting in strong magnetic noise. In stark contrast to the operation
principle of a STNO, we theoretically demonstrate, with the practical
parameters from the experiments, that with a unidirectional current in a dual
asymmetric free-layers (with no pinned layer) based perpendicular magnetic
tunnel junction (pMTJ), both of the free layers can attain a complete and
out-of-phase self-sustained switching without the aid of any external magnetic
field. This design facilitates a switching based spin torque oscillator
(SW-STO) with a full MR swing, and hence a larger output power, for stable and
more thermally robust free-running oscillations. Furthermore, the integration

ability to start an MHD simulation that takes the inversion result as initial

physically consistent MHD data sets with a target similar to the observation.
The new MHD simulation is used to repeat the method in a second iteration,
which further improves the match between observation and simulation, resulting
in a factor of 2.2 lower mean $\chi^2$ value. One advantage of the new
technique is that it provides the physical parameters on a geometrical height

massless Dirac fermions in monolayer graphene has generated dramatic
consequences, such as the unusual quantum Hall effect and Klein tunneling. In
bilayer graphene, charge carriers are massive Dirac fermions with a finite
density of states at zero energy. Because of their non-relativistic nature,
massive Dirac fermions can provide an even better test bed with which to
clarify the importance of chirality in transport measurement than massless
Dirac fermions in monolayer graphene. Here, we report an electronic cloaking
effect as a manifestation of chirality by probing phase coherent transport in
chemical-vapor-deposited bilayer graphene. Conductance oscillations with
different periodicities were observed on extremely narrow bilayer graphene
heterojunctions through electrostatic gating. Using a Fourier analysis
technique, we identified the origin of each individual interference pattern.
Importantly, the electron waves on the two sides of the potential barrier can
be coupled through the evanescent waves inside the barrier, making the confined
states underneath the barrier invisible to electrons. These findings provide
direct evidence for the electronic cloaking effect and hold promise for the
realization of pseudospintronics based on bilayer graphene.

from a polyphonic composition. For Western music, lots of work have been
reported for automated drum analysis of polyphonic composition. However,
attempts at computational analysis of tala by separating the tabla-signal from

results because the left-tabla normally doesn't have frequency overlap with

pattern, against linear approach of Western-rhythm. We have exploited this
cyclic property along with stressed and non-stressed methods of playing

with homogeneous thermal expansion. We assume that material is subject to two
kinds of mechanical deformations: elastic and inelastic. Inelastic deformation
is related to a hardening rule of Norton-Hoff type. Appearance of inelastic
deformation causes transformation of mechanical energy into thermal one, hence
we also take into the consideration changes of material's temperature.
  The novelty of this paper is to take into account the thermal expansion of
material. We are proposing linearisation of the model for homogeneous thermal
expansion, which preserves symmetry of system and therefore total energy is
conserved. Linearisation of material's thermal expansion is performed in
definition of Cauchy stress tensor and in heat equation. In previous studies,
it was done in different way. Considering of such linearisation leads to system
where the coupling between temperature and displacement occurs in two places,
i.e. in the constitutive function for the evolution of visco-elastic strain and
in the additional term in the heat equation, in comparison to models without
thermal expansion. The second coupling was not considered previously. For such
system of equations we prove the existence of solutions. Moreover, we obtain
existence of displacement's time derivative, which has not been done
previously.

atomistic pictures of the initial stage of the oxidation processes occurring at

their associated free-energy barriers for the adsorption of oxygen and the
desorption of carbon atoms. We find that oxygen adsorption shows structural
multi-stability and that the surface-bridge sites are the most stable and
crucial sites for subsequent oxidation. We find that an approaching O$_2$
molecule is adsorbed, then dissociated and finally migrates toward these
surface-bridge sites with a free-energy barrier of 0.7 eV at the ($11\bar20$)
surface. We also find that a CO molecule is desorbed from the metastable
oxidized structure upon the overcoming of a free-energy barrier of 2.4$\sim$2.6
eV, thus constituting one of the annihilation process of C during the
oxidation. The results of the CO molecule desorption on the ($11\bar20$)
surface are compared with the ($000\bar1$) surface. A catalytic effect of
dangling bonds at the surface, causing a drastic reduction of the CO desorption
energy, is found on the ($000\bar1$) surface and the microscopic picture of the
effect is ascribed to an electron transfer from the Si to C dangling bonds. The
intrinsic ($11\bar20$) surface does not show this catalytic effect, and this is
because the surface consists of an equal amount of Si and C dangling bonds and
the electron transfer occurs before the desorption.

the relevant baryon physics, in particular, the AGN feedback. We find that the
baryonic physics around the central region of galaxy clusters significantly
affects the non-sphericity of dark matter distribution even beyond the central
region, approximately up to the half of the virial radius. Therefore it is very
difficult to predict the the probability density function (PDF) of the
projected axis ratio of XSB from dark-matter only N-body simulations as
attempted in previous studies. Indeed we find that the PDF derived from our
simulated clusters exhibits much better agreement with that from the observed
X-ray clusters. This indicates that our present methodology to estimate the

Further improvements in both numerical modeling and observational data will
establish the non-sphericity of clusters as a cosmological test complementary

differences in personal judgments have a large impact on the likeableness of a

dynamics of the paradigmatic research fronts that established the fundamentals
of the biomedical knowledge on HIV/AIDS. A search of papers with the
identifiers ""HIV/AIDS"", ""Human Immunodeficiency Virus"", ""HIV-1"" and ""Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome"" in the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), was carried
out. A citation network of those papers was constructed. Then, a sub-network of
the papers with the highest number of inter-citations (with a minimal in-degree
of 28) was selected to perform a combination of network clustering and text
mining to identify the paradigmatic research fronts and analyze their dynamics.
Thirteen research fronts were identified in this sub-network. The biggest and
oldest front is related to the clinical knowledge on the disease in the
patient. Nine of the fronts are related to the study of specific molecular
structures and mechanisms and two of these fronts are related to the
development of drugs. The rest of the fronts are related to the study of the
disease at the cellular level. Interestingly, the emergence of these fronts
occurred in successive ""waves"" over the time which suggest a transition in the
paradigmatic focus. The emergence and evolution of the biomedical fronts in
HIV/AIDS research is explained not just by the partition of the problem in
elements and interactions leading to increasingly specialized communities, but
also by changes in the technological context of this health problem and the
dramatic changes in the epidemiological reality of HIV/AIDS that occurred
between 1993 and 1995.

II needs to give Agent I a `gift' which can be in the form of information or
material. The gift can either be transfered upon meeting, as in traditional
rendezvous, or it can be dropped o? by II at a location he passes, in the hope
it will be found by I. The gift might be a water bottle for a traveller lost in
the desert; a supply cache for Lieutenant Scott in the Antarctic; or important
information (left as a gift). The common aim of the two agents is to minimize
the time taken for I to either meet II or find the gift. We find optimal agent
paths and droppo? times when the search region is a line, the initial distance
between the players is known and one or both of the players can leave gifts.
When there are no gifts this is the classical asymmetric rendezvous problem
solved by Alpern and Gal in 1995 [10]. We exhibit strategies solving these
various problems and use a `rendezvous algorithm' to establish their
optimality.

light forces to polarizable nano-particles over very long distances. Radiation
pressure forces arise from scattering of guided photons into free space while
gradient forces are based on coherent scattering between different fiber modes
or propagation directions. Interestingly, even scattering between
co-propagating modes induces longitudinal forces as the transverse confinement
of the light modes creates mode dependent longitudinal wave-vectors and photon
momenta. We generalize a proven scattering matrix based approach to calculate
single as well as inter-particle forces to include several forward and backward
propagating modes. We show that an injection of the higher order mode only in a
two mode fiber will induce a stationary tractor force against the injection
direction, when the mode coupling to the lower order mode dominates against
backscattering and free space losses. Generically this arises for non-absorbing
particles at the center of a waveguide. The model also gives improved
predictions for inter-particle forces in evanescent nanofiber fields as
experimentally observed recently. Surprisingly strong tractor forces can also
act on whole optically bound arrays.

two-stream ConvNets can achieve the state-of-the-art performance in action

processing of spatial and temporal information between the two standalone

importantly, it is incapable of finding the salient portions of an action, say,
the frames that are the most discriminative to identify the action. To address
these problems, a \textbf{j}oint \textbf{n}etwork based \textbf{a}ttention

attention mechanism on the temporal domain to capture the long-term dependence

task. As one of the key models for sequence learning, recurrent neural network

reason is that they have only feedforward connections, which is different from
the biological neural system that is typically composed of both feedforward and

biologically-inspired deep network, called shuttleNet\footnote{Our code is
available at \url{https://github.com/shiyemin/shuttlenet}}. Technologically,
the shuttleNet consists of several processors, each of which is a GRU while
associated with multiple groups of cells and states. Unlike traditional RNNs,
all processors inside shuttleNet are loop connected to mimic the brain's
feedforward and feedback connections, in which they are shared across multiple
pathways in the loop connection. Attention mechanism is then employed to select
the best information flow pathway. Extensive experiments conducted on two

In particular, the
exact role of rotation has been questioned by puzzling properties of OB stars
in the Magellanic Clouds. Our goal is to study the relation between surface
chemical composition and rotational velocity, and to test predictions of
evolutionary models including rotation. We have performed a spectroscopic
analysis of a sample of fifteen Galactic O7-8 giant stars. This sample is
homogeneous in terms of mass, metallicity and evolutionary state. It is made of
stars with a wide range of projected rotational velocities. We show that the
sample stars are located on the second half of the main sequence, in a
relatively narrow mass range (25-40 Msun). Almost all stars with projected
rotational velocities above 100 km/s have N/C ratios about ten times the
initial value. Below 100 km/s a wide range of N/C values is observed. The
relation between N/C and surface gravity is well reproduced by various sets of
models. Some evolutionary models including rotation are also able to
consistently explain slowly rotating, highly enriched stars. This is due to
differential rotation which efficiently transports nucleosynthesis products and
allows the surface to rotate slower than the core. In addition, angular
momentum removal by winds amplifies surface braking on the main sequence.
Comparison of the surface composition of O7-8 giant stars with a sample of B
stars with initial masses about four times smaller reveal that chemical
enrichment scales with initial mass, as expected from theory. Although
evolutionary models that include rotation face difficulties in explaining the
chemical properties of O- and B-type stars at low metallicity, some of them can
consistently account for the properties of main-sequence Galactic O stars in
the mass range 25-40 Msun

statistical inference. In particular we show that the family of $S$-divergences
can be alternatively developed using the tubular model adequacy tests; a
further application of the paradigm generates a larger superfamily of
divergences. We describe the properties of this larger class and its potential
applications in robust inference. Along the way, the failure of the first order
influence function analysis in capturing the robustness of these procedures is
also established.

multiple users, where the transmitters each powered by both an energy harvester
and conventional grid, access the network orthogonally on the assigned
frequency band. We assume that the energy harvesting state and channel gain of
each transmitter can be predicted for $K$ time slots a priori. The different
transmitters can cooperate by donating energy to each other. The tradeoff among
the weighted sum throughput, the use of grid energy, and the amount of energy
cooperation is studied through an optimization objective which is a linear
combination of these quantities. This leads to an optimization problem with
O($N^2K$) constraints, where $N$ is the total number of transmitter-receiver
pairs, and the optimization is over seven sets of variables that denote energy
and bandwidth allocation, grid energy utilization, and energy cooperation. To
solve the problem efficiently, an iterative algorithm is proposed using the
Proximal Jacobian ADMM. The optimization sub-problems corresponding to Proximal
Jacobian ADMM steps are solved in closed form. We show that this algorithm
converges to the optimal solution with an overall complexity of O($N^2K^2$).
Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms can make efficient use of
the harvested energy, grid energy, energy cooperation, and the available

non-perturbative techniques in quantum field theory; however, finite
truncations of them violate the Ward identities (WIs) of theories with
spontaneously broken symmetries. The symmetry improvement (SI) method of
Pilaftsis and Teresi attempts to overcome this by imposing the WIs as
constraints on the solution; however the method suffers from the non-existence
of solutions in linear response theory and in certain truncations in
equilibrium. Motivated by this, we introduce a new method called soft symmetry
improvement (SSI) which relaxes the constraint. Violations of WIs are allowed
but punished in a least-squares implementation of the symmetry improvement
idea. A new parameter $\xi$ controls the strength of the constraint. The method
interpolates between the unimproved ($\xi \to \infty$) and SI ($\xi \to 0$)
cases and the hope is that practically useful solutions can be found for finite
$\xi$. We study the SSI-2PIEA for a scalar O(N) model in the Hartree-Fock
approximation. We find that the method is IR sensitive: the system must be
formulated in finite volume $V$ and temperature $T=\beta^{-1}$ and the $V\beta
\to \infty$ limit taken carefully. Three distinct limits exist. Two are
equivalent to the unimproved 2PIEA and SI-2PIEA respectively, and the third is
a new limit where the WI is satisfied but the phase transition is strongly
first order and solutions can fail to exist depending on $\xi$. Further, these
limits are disconnected from each other; there is no smooth way to interpolate
from one to another. These results suggest that any potential advantages of SSI
methods, and indeed any application of (S)SI methods out of equilibrium, must
occur in finite volume.

compared to its counterpart in isolated small size molecules, basically due to
very large numbers of degrees of freedom to be accounted for. Such a control
aims at appropriately optimizing decoherence processes of a central two-level
system (a given vibrational mode, for instance) towards its environmental bath
(including, for instance, all other normal modes). A variety of applications
could potentially be envisioned, either to preserve the central system from
decaying (long duration molecular alignment or orientation, qubit decoherence
protection) or, to speed up the information flow towards the bath (efficient
charge or proton transfers in long chain organic compounds). Achieving such
controls require some quantitative measures of decoherence in relation with
memory effects in the bath response, actually given by the degree of
non-Markovianity. Characteristic decoherence rates of a Spin-Boson model are
calculated using a Nakajima-Zwanzig type master equation with converged HEOM
expansion for the memory kernel. It is shown that, by adequately tuning the
two-level transition frequency through a controlled Stark shift produced by an
external laser field, non-Markovianity can be enhanced in a continuous way

wells at high magnetic fields in the Faraday configuration. In
photoluminescence experiments, we identify three magnetic field regimes. At low
fields, the exciton density is increased by a reduced charge carrier escape
from the trap, and additionally, the excitons' emission energy is corrected by
a positive diamagnetic shift. At intermediate fields, magnetic field dependent
correction terms apply which follow the characteristics of a neutral
magnetoexciton. Due to a combined effect of an increasing binding energy and
lifetime, the exciton density is roughly doubled from zero to about seven
Tesla. At the latter high field value, the charge carriers occupy only the
lowest Landau level. In this situation, the exciton trap can overflow
independently from the electrostatic depth of the trapping potential, and the
energy shift of the excitons caused by the so-called quantum confined Stark
effect is effectively compensated. Instead, the exciton energetics seem to be
driven by the magnetic field dependent renormalization of the many-body
interaction terms. In this regime, the impact of parasitic in-plane fields at
the edge of trapping potential is eliminated.

unsupervised deep transfer learning model is developed based on co-training.
The proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art deep Re-ID models by large
margins: we achieve Rank-1 accuracy of 85.4\%, 83.7\% and 56.3\% on CUHK03,
Market1501, and VIPeR respectively, whilst on VIPeR, our unsupervised model
(45.1\%) beats most supervised models.

problems in a emergency planning or sensitivity setting: Instead of considering
the general fully dynamic problem, we only have to process a single batch
update of size $d$; after the update we have to answer queries.
  In this paper, we consider the dynamic subgraph connectivity problem with
sensitivity $d$: We are given a graph of which some vertices are activated and
some are deactivated. After that we get a single update in which the states of
up to d vertices are changed. Then we get a sequence of connectivity queries in
the subgraph of activated vertices.
  We present the first fully dynamic algorithm for this problem which has an

In this paper, we introduce spatio-temporal sub-pixel convolution networks that

can either reduce the computational cost by 30% whilst maintaining the same

moving and still growing interdisciplinary area of research. 2D vdW materials
are truly 2D crystals with strong covalent in-plane bonds and weak van der

optical and mechanical properties. A very prominent class of 2D materials are
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and amongst them particularly the
semiconducting subclass. Their properties include bandgaps in the near-infrared
to the visible range, decent charge carrier mobility together with high
(photo-)catalytic and mechanical stability and exotic many body phenomena.
These characteristics make the materials highly attractive for both fundamental
research as well as innovative device applications. Furthermore, the materials
exhibit a strong light matter interaction providing a high sun light absorbance
of up to 15% in the monolayer limit, strong scattering cross section in Raman
experiments and access to excitonic phenomena in vdW heterostructures. This
review focuses on the light matter interaction in MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2
that is dictated by the materials complex dielectric functions and on the
multiplicity of studying the first order phonon modes by Raman spectroscopy to
gain access to several material properties such as doping, strain, defects and
temperature. 2D materials provide an interesting platform to stack them into
vdW heterostructures without the limitation of lattice mismatch resulting in
novel devices for application but also to study exotic many body interaction
phenomena such as interlayer excitons. Future perspectives of semiconducting
TMDs and their heterostructures for applications in optoelectronic devices will
be examined and routes to study emergent fundamental problems and many-body
quantum phenomena under excitations with photons will be discussed.

map, with 0.8 arcsec resolution, allowed a morphological comparison with the
H$\alpha$ Hubble Space Telescope image. The radio nebula resembles a spherical
shell, as in the optical. The spectral index map indicates that the radio
emission is due to free-free transitions in the ionised, optically thin gas,
but there are hints of inhomogeneities. We present our new public code RHOCUBE

density distribution in the S61 nebula. We found that different distributions
fit the data, but all of them converge to the same ionised mass, ~0.1 $\rm
M\odot$, which is an order of magnitude smaller than previous estimates. We
show how the nebula models can be used to derive the mass-loss history with
high-temporal resolution. The nebula was probably formed through stellar winds,
rather than eruptions. From the ALMA and VISIR non-detections, plus the derived
extinction map, we deduce that the infrared emission observed by space
telescopes must arise from extended, diffuse dust within the ionised region.

exponentially with increasing arrowhead density, with an ordered state of like

a finite density of walls, coarsening as a function of time $t$ is studied by
simulation. While the number of walls falls as $t^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, the fraction
of persistent arrowheads decays as $t^{-\theta}$ where $\theta$ is close to
$\frac{1}{4}$, quite different from the Ising value. The global persistence too
has $\theta=\frac{1}{4}$, as follows from a heuristic argument. In a
generalization where the $B$ walls diffuse slowly, $\theta$ varies
continuously, increasing with increasing diffusion constant.

throughout a video is crucial for robotics, surveillance, education, and
beyond. Typical approaches decouple this problem by first extracting local
spatiotemporal features from video frames and then feeding them into a temporal
classifier that captures high-level temporal patterns. We introduce a new class
of temporal models, which we call Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), that
use a hierarchy of temporal convolutions to perform fine-grained action
segmentation or detection. Our Encoder-Decoder TCN uses pooling and upsampling
to efficiently capture long-range temporal patterns whereas our Dilated TCN
uses dilated convolutions. We show that TCNs are capable of capturing action
compositions, segment durations, and long-range dependencies, and are over a
magnitude faster to train than competing LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Networks.
We apply these models to three challenging fine-grained datasets and show large
improvements over the state of the art.

to synthesized and real-world signals. For example, we show that the GHT is
suitable for anomaly detection/analysis over networks and that GAS reveals
complementary information in speech signals.

as low as zero. We consider the stop mass with a special importance and focus
on the mass scales as m_stop <=700 GeV, which are excluded by current

to protect ID face photos from being misused. The occlusions incurred by random
meshes severely degenerate the performance of face verification systems, which
raises the MeshFace verification problem between MeshFace and daily photos.
Previous methods cast this problem as a typical low-level vision problem, i.e.
blind inpainting. They recover perceptually pleasing clear ID photos from
MeshFaces by enforcing pixel level similarity between the recovered ID images
and the ground-truth clear ID images and then perform face verification on
them. Essentially, face verification is conducted on a compact feature space
rather than the image pixel space. Therefore, this paper argues that pixel
level similarity and feature level similarity jointly offer the key to improve
the verification performance. Based on this insight, we offer a novel feature
oriented blind face inpainting framework. Specifically, we implement this by
establishing a novel DeMeshNet, which consists of three parts. The first part
addresses blind inpainting of the MeshFaces by implicitly exploiting extra
supervision from the occlusion position to enforce pixel level similarity. The
second part explicitly enforces a feature level similarity in the compact
feature space, which can explore informative supervision from the feature space
to produce better inpainting results for verification. The last part copes with
face alignment within the net via a customized spatial transformer module when
extracting deep facial features. All the three parts are implemented within an
end-to-end network that facilitates efficient optimization. Extensive
experiments on two MeshFace datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed DeMeshNet as well as the insight of this paper.

impedes the disconnection movement. The BP interfaces can transform to the
{10-12} twin boundary (TB) and vice versa. While the process from BP interface
to TB is described as the linear pile-up of interface disconnections, the versa
transformation is proposed as the upright pile-up process. Both BP
transformation and {10-12} twinning can efficiently accommodate the strain
along the c-axis, and the conjugate BP interfaces and {10-12} TBs account for
the large deviations of twin interfaces from the {10-12} twin plane.

substitutes the patch with more facets and the same boundary for the patch on
the surface of a simple polytope to produce a new simple polytope. It is known

We analyze pairs of objects: a finite set of operations, and a family of
acceptable polytopes containing fullerenes such that any polytope of the family
can be obtained from the dodecahedron by a sequence of operations from the

evidence strength for different parameter values can be interpreted from the
ratio of likelihoods at different points on the likelihood curve. The
likelihood function can, however, be unknown or difficult to compute; e.g. for
genetic association studies with a binary outcome in large multi-generational
families. Composite likelihood is a convenient alternative to using the real
likelihood and here we show composite likelihoods have valid evidential
interpretation. We show that composite likelihoods, with a robust adjustment,
have two large sample performance properties that enable reliable evaluation of
relative evidence for different values on the likelihood curve: (1) The
composite likelihood function will support the true value over the false value
by an arbitrarily large factor; and (2) the probability of favouring a false
value over a true value with high probability is small and bounded. Using an
extensive simulation study, and in a genetic association analysis of reading
disability in large complex pedigrees, we show that the composite approach
yields valid statistical inference. Results are compared to analyses using
generalized estimating equations and show similar inference is obtained,

  Conversion",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The conversion of traditional film into stereo 3D has become an important
problem in the past decade. One of the main bottlenecks is a disocclusion step,
which in commercial 3D conversion is usually done by teams of artists armed
with a toolbox of inpainting algorithms. A current difficulty in this is that
most available algorithms are either too slow for interactive use, or provide
no intuitive means for users to tweak the output. In this paper we present a
new fast inpainting algorithm based on transporting along automatically
detected splines, which the user may edit. Our algorithm is implemented on the
GPU and fills the inpainting domain in successive shells that adapt their shape
on the fly. In order to allocate GPU resources as efficiently as possible, we
propose a parallel algorithm to track the inpainting interface as it evolves,
ensuring that no resources are wasted on pixels that are not currently being
worked on. Theoretical analysis of the time and processor complexiy of our
algorithm without and with tracking (as well as numerous numerical experiments)
demonstrate the merits of the latter. Our transport mechanism is similar to the
one used in coherence transport, but improves upon it by corrected a ""kinking""
phenomena whereby extrapolated isophotes may bend at the boundary of the
inpainting domain. Theoretical results explaining this phenomena and its
resolution are presented. Although our method ignores texture, in many cases
this is not a problem due to the thin inpainting domains in 3D conversion.
Experimental results show that our method can achieve a visual quality that is
competitive with the state-of-the-art while maintaining interactive speeds and
providing the user with an intuitive interface to tweak the results.

Compared with traditional visual recognition tasks, it is extremely challenging
to understand these psychologically triggered visual patterns in fake images.
Traditional general image classification datasets, such as ImageNet set, are
designed for feature learning at the object level but are not suitable for
learning the hyper-features that would be required by image credibility
analysis. In order to overcome the scarcity of training samples of fake images,
we first construct a large-scale auxiliary dataset indirectly related to this

images collected automatically from social media. Through an AdaBoost-like
transfer learning algorithm, we train a CNN model with a few instances in the

gradually transfer it to the target task. Experiments on a real-world testing

Subsequent inquiries have suggested that only certain cosmologies would allow
such a retarded-advanced wave mechanism to exist. These include quasi-steady

the exclusion process is a diminishing density of future absorbers in an
ever-expanding universe. Such absorbers would be expected to be real

sites, if they exist, would not be so diminished. Such sites would be plentiful
on the future light horizon, receding from the source at the speed of light.
The present treatment proposes that virtual absorption sites are present at

observable depends upon material properties, pulse properties and the number of
pulses applied in a complex manner that is not yet well understood. The
incubation effect is one example. It manifests as a change in the ablation
threshold as a function of number of laser pulses applied and is driven by
photoinduced defect accumulation in the material. Here, we study femtosecond
(800 nm, 110 fs, 0.1-1 mJ/pulse) micromachining of a material with well-defined
initial defect concentrations: doped Si across a range of dopant types and
concentrations. The single-pulse ablation threshold (Fth,1) was observed to
decrease with increasing dopant concentration, from a maximum of 0.70 J/cm2
(+/-0.02) for undoped Si to 0.51 J/cm2 (+/-0.01) for highly N-type doped Si.
The effect was greater for N-type doped Si than for P-type, consistent with the
higher carrier mobility of electrons compared to holes. In contrast, the
infinite-pulse ablation threshold (Fth,inf) was the same for all doping levels
and types. We attribute this asymptotic behaviour to a maximum defect
concentration that is independent of the initial defect concentration and type.
These results lend insight into the mechanism of multipulse, femtosecond laser

camera wearer's internal state such as his intentions and attention, and thus,
only the person wearing the camera can provide the importance labels. Such a
constraint makes the annotation process costly and limited in scalability.
  In this work, we show that we can detect important objects in first-person
images without the supervision by the camera wearer or even third-person
labelers. We formulate an important detection problem as an interplay between
the 1) segmentation and 2) recognition agents. The segmentation agent first
proposes a possible important object segmentation mask for each image, and then
feeds it to the recognition agent, which learns to predict an important object
mask using visual semantics and spatial features.
  We implement such an interplay between both agents via an alternating
cross-pathway supervision scheme inside our proposed Visual-Spatial Network
(VSN). Our VSN consists of spatial (""where"") and visual (""what"") pathways, one
of which learns common visual semantics while the other focuses on the spatial
location cues. Our unsupervised learning is accomplished via a cross-pathway
supervision, where one pathway feeds its predictions to a segmentation agent,
which proposes a candidate important object segmentation mask that is then used
by the other pathway as a supervisory signal. We show our method's success on
two different important object datasets, where our method achieves similar or

improving the co-clustering performance via manifold ensemble learning, which
is able to maximally approximate the intrinsic manifolds of both the sample and

proposed indicators based on two parameters of the state-mapping network cannot
discriminate the dynamical complexity of the discrete dynamical systems
composed of a 1-D Cellular Automata.

a gravitational object, so it helps to obtain some information about the

formula for the two-time current correlation function is derived for the case
of transport through a nanojunction in response to an arbitrary time-dependent
bias. The one-particle Hamiltonian and the Wide Band Limit Approximation (WBLA)
are assumed, enabling us to extract all necessary Green's functions and self
energies for the system, extending the analytic work presented previously
[Ridley et al. Phys. Rev. B (2015)]. We show that our new expression for the
two-time correlation function generalises the B\""uttiker theory of shot and
thermal noise on the current through a nanojunction to the time-dependent bias
case including the transient regime following the switch-on. Transient terms in
the correlation function arise from an initial state that does not assume (as
is usually done) that the system is initially uncoupled, i.e. our approach is
partition-free. We show that when the bias loses its time-dependence, the long
time-limit of the current correlation function depends on the time difference
only, as in this case an ideal steady state is reached. This enables derivation
of known results for the single frequency power spectrum and for the zero
frequency limit of this power spectrum. In addition, we present a technique
which for the first time facilitates fast calculations of the transient quantum
noise, valid for arbitrary temperature, time and voltage scales. We apply this
to the quantum dot and molecular wire systems for both DC and AC biases, and
find a novel signature of the traversal time for electrons crossing the wire in
the time-dependent cross-lead current correlations.

covariance estimators in adaptive matched filtering schemes in signal
processing applications such as RADAR and SONAR detection, for which a
contamination by outliers of the estimated noise covariance can lead to a great
impact on performances, in particular when these outliers are similar to the

about three aspects such as tournament conducting cost, competitiveness

tree to detect potential throwaway matches. The analysis performed using the
proposed method reveals the strengths and weaknesses of tournament structures.
As a conclusion, single elimination is best if we want to qualify one winner
only, all matches conducted are exciting in term of competitiveness. Double
elimination with proper seeding system is a better choice if we want to qualify
more winners. A reasonable number of extra matches need to be conducted in
exchange of being able to qualify top four winners. Round-robin gives reliable
ranking precision for all participants. However, its conduction cost is very
high, and it fails to maintain competitiveness development.

materials with discrete micro- or meso-structures, or for a description of
heterogeneous materials which can be modelled discretely. They are, however,
computationally prohibitive for engineering-scale applications. The
(variational) QuasiContinuum (QC) method is a concurrent multiscale approach
that reduces their computational cost by fully resolving the (dissipative)
lattice network in small regions of interest while coarsening elsewhere. When
applied to damageable lattices, moving crack tips can be captured by adaptive
mesh refinement schemes, whereas fully-resolved trails in crack wakes can be
removed by mesh coarsening. In order to address crack propagation efficiently
and accurately, we develop in this contribution the necessary generalizations
of the variational QC methodology. First, a suitable definition of crack paths
in discrete systems is introduced, which allows for their geometrical
representation in terms of the signed distance function. Second, special
function enrichments based on the partition of unity concept are adopted, in
order to capture kinematics in the wakes of crack tips. Third, a summation rule
that reflects the adopted enrichment functions with sufficient degree of
accuracy is developed. Finally, as our standpoint is variational, we discuss
implications of the mesh refinement and coarsening from an energy-consistency
point of view. All theoretical considerations are demonstrated using two
numerical examples for which the resulting reaction forces, energy evolutions,
and crack paths are compared to those of the direct numerical simulations.

achieved together with high availability and high performance requirements even
in presence of network partitions. There are several proposals in the
literature for causally consistent data stores. Thanks to the use of single
scalar physical clocks, GentleRain has a throughput higher than other proposals
such as COPS or Orbe. However, both of its correctness and performance relay on
monotonic synchronized physical clocks. Specifically, if physical clocks go
backward its correctness is violated. In addition, GentleRain is sensitive on
the clock synchronization, and clock skew may slow write operations in
GenlteRain. In this paper, we want to solve this issue in GenlteRain by using
Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC) instead of physical clocks. Using HLC, GentleRain
protocl is not sensitive on the clock skew anymore. In addition, even if clocks
go backward, the correctness of the system is not violated. Furthermore, by
HLC, we timestamp versions with a clock very close to the physical clocks.
Thus, we can take causally consistency snapshot of the system at any give
physical time. We call GentleRain protocol with HLCs GentleRain+. We have
implemented GentleRain+ protocol, and have evaluated it experimentally.
GentleRain+ provides faster write operations compare to GentleRain that rely
solely on physical clocks to achieve causal consistency. We have also shown
that using HLC instead of physical clock does not have any overhead. Thus, it
makes GentleRain more robust on clock anomalies at no cost.
