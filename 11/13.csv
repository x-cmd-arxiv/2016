Despite significant advances in observations and theory, our knowledge on the
fundamental properties of these structures is limited. Here, we present
unprecedented observations of accelerating slow magnetoacoustic waves along a
coronal loop that show differential propagation speeds in two distinct
temperature channels, revealing the multi-stranded and multi-thermal nature of
the loop. Utilizing the observed speeds and employing nonlinear force-free
magnetic field extrapolations, we derive the actual temperature variation along
the loop in both channels, and thus are able to resolve two individual

of four types of \emph{first-order} hydrodynamic theories for non-perfect

we study the propagation of density, velocity and heat fluctuations in a wide

As expected in the low temperature classical regime all theories give the same
results consistent with the numerics. In the high temperature extremely

  insights from comparisons between published laboratory data and correlations
  for sediment and pipeline slurry transport",,,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bed load transport is the movement of particles along the top of a bed
through rolling, saltation, and suspension created by turbulent lift above the
bed surface. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the
idea that bed load transport is significant for proppant transport during
hydraulic fracturing. However, scaling arguments suggest that bed load
transport is only dominant in the laboratory and is negligible at the field
scale. I review laboratory experiments that have been used to develop concepts
of bed load transport in hydraulic fracturing. I also review the scaling
arguments and laboratory results that have been used to argue that viscous
drag, not bed load transport, is dominant at the field scale. I compare
literature correlations for fluvial sediment transport and for pipeline slurry
transport with published laboratory data on proppant transport in slot flow.
The comparisons indicate that fluvial transport correlations are suitable for
predicting the rate of sediment erosion due to flow of proppant-free fluid over
a bed. The pipeline slurry correlations are suitable for predicting the ability
of proppant that is already in suspension to flow in bed transport without
settling, but only if the aspect ratio of the flowing region in the slot is
close to unity. This can occur at the laboratory scale, but not in the field.
The comparison indicates that at low rates of proppant flow, the equilibrium
bed height in a laboratory proppant transport experiment can be predicted from
pipeline slurry correlations. However, as the volumetric flow rate and the
aspect ratio of the flowing region in the slot increase, the applicability of
the pipeline slurry correlations breaks down. Laboratory experiments using
higher volumetric flow rate indicate that bed load transport rates are too low
to be significant at the field scale, even if the flow velocity is very high.

progressively larger scale, more complex spatiotemporal features are

localist representations (codes) in each representational field, which we
equate with the cortical macrocolumn (mac), at each level. In localism, each
represented feature/event (item) is coded by a single unit. Our model, Sparsey,
is also hierarchical but crucially, uses sparse distributed coding (SDC) in
every mac in all levels. In SDC, each represented item is coded by a small
subset of the mac's units. SDCs of different items can overlap and the size of
overlap between items can represent their similarity. The difference between
localism and SDC is crucial because SDC allows the two essential operations of
associative memory, storing a new item and retrieving the best-matching stored
item, to be done in fixed time for the life of the model. Since the model's
core algorithm, which does both storage and retrieval (inference), makes a
single pass over all macs on each time step, the overall model's
storage/retrieval operation is also fixed-time, a criterion we consider
essential for scalability to huge datasets. A 2010 paper described a
nonhierarchical version of this model in the context of purely spatial pattern
processing. Here, we elaborate a fully hierarchical model (arbitrary numbers of
levels and macs per level), describing novel model principles like progressive
critical periods, dynamic modulation of principal cells' activation functions

simultaneously active hypotheses, a novel method of time warp invariant
recognition, and we report results showing learning/recognition of

the two and four point functions at leading order. The leading order two point

discrete random variables using observational data. Unlike previous work, we
keep the most general functional model but make an assumption on the unobserved
exogenous variable: Inspired by Occam's razor, we assume that the exogenous
variable is simple in the true causal direction. We quantify simplicity using
R\'enyi entropy. Our main result is that, under natural assumptions, if the
exogenous variable has low $H_0$ entropy (cardinality) in the true direction,
it must have high $H_0$ entropy in the wrong direction. We establish several
algorithmic hardness results about estimating the minimum entropy exogenous
variable. We show that the problem of finding the exogenous variable with
minimum entropy is equivalent to the problem of finding minimum joint entropy
given $n$ marginal distributions, also known as minimum entropy coupling
problem. We propose an efficient greedy algorithm for the minimum entropy
coupling problem, that for $n=2$ provably finds a local optimum. This gives a
greedy algorithm for finding the exogenous variable with minimum $H_1$ (Shannon
Entropy). Our greedy entropy-based causal inference algorithm has similar
performance to the state of the art additive noise models in real datasets. One
advantage of our approach is that we make no use of the values of random
variables but only their distributions. Our method can therefore be used for
causal inference for both ordinal and also categorical data, unlike additive
noise models.

with a bandwidth of 32 GHz from 84 to 116 GHz in only two tunings. Among the

HCO+, N2H+ (1-0), and 12CS, 32SO, SiO, c-C3H2, CH3OH (2-1) transitions. We
introduce the molecular anatomy of the Orion B GMC, including relations between
line intensities and gas column density or far-UV radiation fields, and
correlations between selected line and line ratios. We also obtain a
dust-traced gas mass that is less than about one third the CO-traced mass,
using the standard Xco conversion factor. The presence of overluminous CO can
be traced back to the dependence of the CO intensity on UV illumination. In
fact, while most lines show some dependence on the UV radiation field, CN and
CCH are the most sensitive. Moreover dense cloud cores are almost exclusively
traced by N2H+. Other traditional high density tracers, such as HCN (1-0), are
also easily detected in extended translucent regions at a typical density of
about 500 H2 cm-3. In general, we find no straightforward relation between line
critical density and the fraction of the line luminosity coming from dense gas
regions. Our initial findings demonstrate that the relations between line
(ratio) intensities and environment in GMCs are more complicated than often
assumed. Sensitivity (i.e., the molecular column density), excitation, and
above all chemistry contribute to the observed line intensity distributions.
They must be considered together when developing the next generation of
extra-galactic molecular line diagnostics of mass, density, temperature and
radiation field.

investigated through the idea of controlling the linearization error, and
regularization parameters are defined following this analysis, then assembled
in an adaptive algorithm. The main innovations of this paper include the
introduction of a Picard-like regularization term scaled by its cancellation
effect on the linearization error to stabilize the Newton-like iteration; an
updated analysis of the regularization parameters in terms of minimizing an

exclude a pure parabolic outflow solution, but rather suggest an intermediate
solution with quasi-parabolic streams, which are frequently seen in numerical
simulations. Inspection of the large opening angles near the SMBH and the range
of the Lorentz factors derived from our results support our analyses. Our
result suggests that the conical jet paradigm in AGNs needs to be re-examined
by mm/sub-mm VLBI observations.

benefits of LSGANs over regular GANs. First, LSGANs are able to generate higher
quality images than regular GANs. Second, LSGANs perform more stable during the
learning process. We evaluate LSGANs on five scene datasets and the
experimental results show that the images generated by LSGANs are of better

For such proteins, molecular mechanisms governing their interactions with

folded, calcium-loaded calmodulin (CaM) interaction with the calcineurin
regulatory IDP as a prototype for IDP-mediated signal transduction events, we
uncover the interplay of IDP structure and electrostatic interactions in

biophysical approaches including stopped-flow and computational simulation, we
quantify the relative contributions of electrostatic interactions and
conformational ensemble characteristics in determining association kinetics of
calmodulin (CaM) and the calcineurin regulatory domain (CaN RD). Our chief
findings are that CaM/CN RD association rates are strongly dependent on ionic
strength and that observed rates are largely determined by the
electrostatically-driven interaction strength between CaM and the narrow CaN RD
calmodulin recognition domain. These studies highlight a molecular mechanism of
controlling signal transduction kinetics that may be utilized in wide-ranging

optimizing noisy black box functions. One example in machine learning is
hyper-parameter optimization where each evaluation of the target function
requires training a model which may involve days or even weeks of computation.
Most methods for this so-called ""Bayesian optimization"" only allow sequential
exploration of the parameter space. However, it is often desirable to propose
batches or sets of parameter values to explore simultaneously, especially when
there are large parallel processing facilities at our disposal. Batch methods
require modeling the interaction between the different evaluations in the
batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a
new approach for parallelizing Bayesian optimization by modeling the diversity
of a batch via Determinantal point processes (DPPs) whose kernels are learned
automatically. This allows us to generalize a previous result as well as prove
better regret bounds based on DPP sampling. Our experiments on a variety of
synthetic and real-world robotics and hyper-parameter optimization tasks
indicate that our DPP-based methods, especially those based on DPP sampling,
outperform state-of-the-art methods.

Assuming such a small operation, we find that energy extraction requires a
negative response spectrum in a certain frequency region, which inevitably
requires an internal power source to maintain. Energy is then extracted by
operating the system at these frequencies. Negative response is intrinsic to
any system that adapts to a slow external operation, which could be realized
through integral feedback control. These are demonstrated through a solvable

solution in tensor product structure for stochastic partial differential
equations (SPDEs).
  Compared with many widely used variation-separation methods, NVS shares their
merits but has less computation complexity and better efficiency.
  NVS can be used to get the separated representation of the solution for SPDE
in a systematic enrichment manner.
  No iteration is performed at each enrichment step. This is a significant
improvement compared with proper generalized decomposition. Because the
stochastic functions of the separated representations obtained by NVS depend on
the previous terms, this impacts on the computation efficiency and brings great
challenge for numerical simulation for the problems in high stochastic
dimensional spaces.
  In order to overcome the difficulty, we propose an improved least angle
regression algorithm (ILARS) and a hierarchical sparse low rank tensor
approximation (HSLRTA) method based on sparse regularization. For ILARS, we
explicitly give the selection of the optimal regularization parameters at each
step based on least angle regression algorithm (LARS) for lasso problems such
that ILARS is much more efficient.
  HSLRTA hierarchically decomposes a high dimensional problem into some low
dimensional problems and brings an accurate approximation for the solution to
SPDEs in high dimensional stochastic spaces using limited computer resource.
  A few numerical examples are presented to illustrate the efficacy of the
proposed methods.

likely element is the identity, probabilities decrease along any geodesic from
the identity, and the least likely element is the longest element, if the group

probabilities, so long as the identity is at least as likely as any other.

of approximate counting. It is conjectured that there is a fully
polynomial-time (randomized) approximation scheme (FPTAS/FPRAS) for counting
the number of proper colorings as long as $q \geq \Delta + 1$, where $q$ is the
number of colors and $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. The bound of
$q = \Delta + 1$ is the uniqueness threshold for Gibbs measure on
$\Delta$-regular infinite trees. However, the conjecture remained open even for
any fixed $\Delta\geq 3$ (The cases of $\Delta=1, 2$ are trivial). In this
paper, we design an FPTAS for counting the number of proper $4$-colorings on
graphs with maximum degree $3$ and thus confirm the conjecture in the case of
$\Delta=3$. This is the first time to achieve this optimal bound of $q = \Delta
+ 1$. Previously, the best FPRAS requires $q > \frac{11}{6} \Delta$ and the
best deterministic FPTAS requires $q > 2.581\Delta + 1$ for general graphs. In
the case of $\Delta=3$, the best previous result is an FPRAS for counting
proper 5-colorings. We note that there is a barrier to go beyond $q = \Delta +
2$ for single-site Glauber dynamics based FPRAS and we overcome this by
correlation decay approach. Moreover, we develop a number of new techniques for
the correlation decay approach which can find applications in other approximate
counting problems.

achieved in experiment. The conduction bands convergence is observed for
unstrained $\mathrm{PtTe_2}$, which can be removed by both compressive and
tensile strains. Tensile strain can give rise to valence bands convergence by
changing the position of valence band maximum (VBM), which can induce enhanced
Seebeck coefficient, being favorable for high power factor. It is found that
tensile strain can also reduce lattice thermal conductivity, which at the
strain of 4\% can decrease by about 19\% compared to unstrained one at room
temperature. By considering tensile strain effects on $ZT_e$ and lattice
thermal conductivity, tensile strain indeed can improve p-type efficiency of

limited by the sampling rate bottleneck. The optical wideband regime may exceed
analog to digital converters (ADCs) front-end bandwidth. Multi-channel sampling
approaches, such as multicoset or interleaved ADCs, have been proposed to
sample the wideband signal using several channels. Each channel samples below
the Nyquist rate such that the overall sampling rate is preserved. However,
this scheme suffers from two practical limitations that make its implementation
difficult. First, the inherent anti-aliasing filter of the samplers distorts
the wideband signal. Second, it requires accurate time shifts on the order of
the signal's Nyquist rate, which are challenging to maintain. In this work, we
propose an alternative multi-channel sampling scheme, the wideband demodulator
for optical waveforms (WINDOW), based on analog RF demodulation, where each
channel aliases the spectrum using a periodic mixing function before
integration and sampling. We show that intentionally using the inherent ADC
filter to perform integration increases the signal to noise ratio (SNR). We
demonstrate both theoretically and through numerical experiments that our
system outperforms multicoset in terms of signal recovery and symbol estimation

English topical label space, without any text categorization training data. The
approach, Cross-Lingual Dataless Document Classification (CLDDC) relies on
mapping the English labels or short category description into a Wikipedia-based
semantic representation, and on the use of the target language Wikipedia.
Consequently, performance could suffer when Wikipedia in the target language is
small. In this paper, we focus on languages with small Wikipedias,
(Small-Wikipedia languages, SWLs). We use a word-level dictionary to convert
documents in a SWL to a large-Wikipedia language (LWLs), and then perform CLDDC
based on the LWL's Wikipedia. This approach can be applied to thousands of
languages, which can be contrasted with machine translation, which is a
supervision heavy approach and can be done for about 100 languages. We also
develop a ranking algorithm that makes use of language similarity metrics to
automatically select a good LWL, and show that this significantly improves
classification of SWLs' documents, performing comparably to the best bridge
possible.

We focus particularly on the fluctuations of particle activity, which is
defined as the number of moving particles per unit bed {length}. Based on a
stochastic model recently proposed by \citet{Ancey2013}, we derive the second
moment of particle activity analytically; that is the spatial correlation
functions of particle activity. From these expressions, we show that large
moving particle clusters can develop spatially. Also, we provide evidence that
fluctuations of particle activity are scale-dependent. Two characteristic
lengths emerge from the model: a saturation length $\ell_{sat}$ describing the
length needed for a perturbation in particle activity to relax to the
homogeneous solution, and a correlation length $\ell_c$ describing the typical
size of moving particle clusters. A dimensionless P\'eclet number can also be
defined according to the transport model. Three different experimental data
sets are used to test the theoretical results. We show that the stochastic
model describes spatial patterns of particle activity well at all scales. In
particular, we show that $\ell_c$ and $\ell_{sat}$ may be relatively large
compared to typical scales encountered in bed load experiments (grain diameter,
water depth, bed form wavelength, flume length...) suggesting that the spatial
fluctuations of particle activity have a non-negligible impact on the average
transport process.

features that are useful for coreference resolution, e.g. context and gender
information, are no longer effective anymore. Therefore, the KEE models are
proposed to provide a general framework to make use of commonsense knowledge
for solving the PDP problems. Since the PDP task doesn't have training data,
the KEE models would be used during the unsupervised feature extraction
process. To evaluate the effectiveness of the KEE models, we propose to
incorporate various commonsense knowledge bases, including ConceptNet, WordNet,
and CauseCom, into the KEE training process. We achieved the best performance
by applying the proposed methods to the 2016 Winograd Schema Challenge. In
addition, experiments conducted on the standard PDP task indicate that, the
proposed KEE models could solve the PDP problems by achieving 66.7% accuracy,
which is a new state-of-the-art performance.

in the standard model of particle theory - the cubically dispersed Dirac
semimetal (CDSM) - is realized in a specific, stable solid state system that
has been made years ago, but was not appreciated to host such a unique Fermion,
composed of six Weyl Fermions, 3 with left-handed and 3 with right-handed
chirality. We identified the crystal symmetry constraints and found the space
group P63/m as one of the two that can support a CDSM, of which the
characteristic band crossing has linear dispersion along the principle axis but
cubic dispersion in the plane perpendicular to it. We then conducted a material
search using density functional theory identifying a group of
quasi-one-dimensional molybdenum mono-chalcogenide compounds A(MoX)3 (A = Na,
K, Rb, In, Tl, X = S, Se, Te) as ideal CDSM candidates. Studying the stability
of the A(MoX)3 family reveals a few candidates such as Rb(MoTe)3 and Tl(MoTe)3
that are predicted to be resilient to Peierls distortion, thus retaining the
metallic character. The combination of one-dimensionality and metallic nature
in this family provides a platform for unusual optical signature - polarization
dependent metallic vs insulating response.

investigate the leadership persistence probability $F(\tau)$ i.e. the
probability that a leader retains its leadership up to time $\tau$. We find
that it exhibits a power-law $F(\tau)\sim \tau^{-\theta(m)}$ with persistence
exponent $\theta(m) \approx 1.51 \ \forall \ m$ in the MDA networks and
$\theta(m) \rightarrow 1.53$ exponentially with $m$ in the BA networks.

the process of discovering new materials and compounds, and of optimizing their
properties. The large databases of structures and properties that result from
computational searches, as well as the agglomeration of data of heterogeneous
provenance leads to considerable challenges when it comes to navigating the
database, representing its structure at a glance, understanding
structure-property relations, eliminating duplicates and identifying
inconsistencies. Here we present a case study, based on a data set of
conformers of amino acids and dipeptides, of how machine-learning techniques
can help addressing these issues. We will exploit a recently developed strategy
to define a metric between structures, and use it as the basis of both
clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques showing how these can help
reveal structure-property relations, identify outliers and inconsistent
structures, and rationalise how perturbations (e.g. binding of ions to the
molecule) affect the stability of different conformers.

torsional micro actuator is studied. The micro actuator is composed of a micro
mirror and two torsional beams, which are excited with two electrodes. Unlike
the traditional micro actuators, the electrostatic force exerted to both side
of micro mirror, so the model is exposed to a DC voltage applied from the
ground electrodes. The static governing equation of the torsional micro
actuator is derived and the relation between rotation angle and the driving
voltage is determined. Local and global bifurcation analysis is performed,
considering torsional characteristics of the micro-beams. By solving static
deflection equation, the fixed points of the actuator are obtained. Critical
values of the applied voltage leading to qualitative changes in the micro
actuator behavior through a saddle node or pitchfork bifurcations for different
spatial condition are obtained. Furthermore the effects of different gap and
electrode sizes as well as beam lengths on the dynamic behavior are
investigated. It is shown that increasing the applied voltage leads the
structure to an unstable condition by undergoing to saddle node and pitchfork
bifurcations when the voltages ratio is zero and one, respectively.

  Communications","5 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Frequency offset modulation (FOM) is proposed as a new concept to provide
both high energy efficiency and high spectral efficiency for communications. In
the FOM system, an array of transmitters (TXs) is deployed and only one TX is
activated for data transmission at any signaling time instance. The TX index
distinguished by a very slight frequency offset among the entire occupied
bandwidth is exploited to implicitly convey a bit unit without any power or
signal radiation, saving the power and spectral resources. Moreover, the FOM is
characterized by removing the stringent requirements on distinguishable spatial
channels and perfect priori channel knowledge, while retaining the advantages
of no inter-channel interference and no need of inter-antenna synchronization.
In addition, a hybrid solution integrating the FOM and the spatial modulation
is discussed to further improve the energy efficiency and spectral efficiency.
Consequently, the FOM will be an enabling and green solution to support
ever-increasing high-capacity data traffic in a variety of interdisciplinary
fields.
