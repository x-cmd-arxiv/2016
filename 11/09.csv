Microwave Background (CMB) is a necessary step towards the detection of the
B-mode signal associated with primordial gravitational waves. We present a
method to simulate maps of polarized dust emission on the sphere, similarly to
what is done for the CMB anisotropies. This method builds on the understanding
of Galactic polarization stemming from the analysis of Planck data. It relates
the dust polarization sky to the structure of the Galactic magnetic field and
its coupling with interstellar matter and turbulence. The Galactic magnetic
field is modelled as a superposition of a mean uniform field and a random
component with a power-law power spectrum of exponent $\alpha_{\rm M}$. The
model parameters are constrained to fit the power spectra of dust polarization
EE, BB and TE measured using Planck data. We find that the slopes of the E and
B power spectra of dust polarization are matched for $\alpha_{\rm M} = -2.5$.
The model allows us to compute multiple realizations of the Stokes Q and U maps
for different realizations of the random component of the magnetic field, and
to quantify the variance of dust polarization spectra for any given sky area
outside of the Galactic plane. The simulations reproduce the scaling relation
between the dust polarization power and the mean total dust intensity including
the observed dispersion around the mean relation. We also propose a method to
carry out multi-frequency simulations including the decorrelation measured
recently by Planck, using a given covariance matrix of the polarization maps.
These simulations are well suited to optimize component separation methods and
to quantify the confidence with which the dust and CMB B-modes can be separated
in present and future experiments. We also provide an astrophysical perspective
on our modeling of the dust polarization spectra.

lower kHz QPO of the neutron star LMXB Aquila X-1 for the first time. We
compute broadband energy lags, as well as energy-dependent lags and the
covariance spectrum using data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). We
find very similar characteristics to other previously studied systems,
including soft lags of $\sim$30 $\mu$s between the 3.0 - 8.0 keV and 8.0 - 20.0
keV energy bands at the average QPO frequency. We also find lags that show a
nearly monotonic trend with energy, with the highest energy photons arriving
first. The covariance spectrum of the lower kHz QPO is well fit by a thermal
Comptonization model, though we find a higher seed photon temperature compared
to the mean spectrum, which was also seen in Peille et al., (2015), and
indicates the possibility of a composite boundary layer emitting region.
Lastly, we see in one set of observations, an Fe K component in the covariance
spectrum at 2.4-$\sigma$ confidence which may raise questions about the role of
reverberation in the production of lags.

that a wavelength-dependent critical bend radius exists below which the
bend-loss reaches a maximum, and that this can be calculated from the

straightforward design of single-ring PCFs that are bend-insensitive for

areas of current research. Possible DM candidates are ultralight fields such as
axions and weak interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Axions piled up in the
center of stars are supposed to generate matter/DM configurations with
oscillating geometries at a very rapid frequency, which is a multiple of the
axion mass $m_B$ [1,2]. Borra and Trottier recently found peculiar ultrafast
periodic spectral modulations in $236$ main sequence stars in the sample of
$2.5$ million spectra of galactic halo stars of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
that were interpreted as optical signals from extraterrestrial civilizations,
possible candidates for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI)
program [3]. We argue, instead, that this could be the first indirect evidence
of bosonic axion-like DM fields inside main sequence stars, with a stable
radiative nucleus, where a stable DM core can be hosted. These oscillations
were not observed in earlier stellar spectral classes probably because of the
impossibility of starting a stable oscillatory regime due to the presence of
chaotic motions in their convective nuclei. The axion mass values, $(50 < m_B <
2.4 \times 10^{3})~ \mathrm{\mu eV}$, obtained from the frequency range

assigning the shortest possible labels (bit strings) to nodes of rooted trees,
so that ancestry queries between any two nodes can be answered by inspecting
their assigned labels only. This problem was introduced more than twenty years
ago by Kannan et al. [STOC '88], and is among the most well-studied problems in
the field of informative labeling schemes. We construct an ancestry-labeling
scheme for $n$-node trees with label size $\log_2 n + O(\log \log n)$ bits,
thus matching the $\log_2 n + O(\log \log n)$ bits lower bound given by Alstrup
et al. [SODA '03]. Our scheme is based on a simplified ancestry scheme that
operates extremely well on a restricted set of trees. In particular, for the
set of n-node trees with depth at most d, the simplified ancestry scheme enjoys
label size of $\log_2 n + 2 \log_2 d + O(1)$ bits. Since the depth of most XML
trees is at most some small constant, such an ancestry scheme may be of
practical use. In addition, we also obtain an adjacency-labeling scheme that
labels n-node trees of depth d with labels of size $\log_2 n + 3 \log_2 d +
O(1)$ bits. All our schemes assign the labels in linear time, and guarantee
that any query can be answered in constant time. Finally, our ancestry scheme
finds applications to the construction of small universal partially ordered
sets (posets). Specifically, for any fixed integer k, it enables the
construction of a universal poset of size $\tilde O(n^k)$ for the family of
$n$-element posets with tree-dimension at most $k$. Up to lower order terms,
this bound is tight thanks to a lower bound of $n^{k-o(1)}$ due to Alon and
Scheinerman [Order '88].

magnetic dichroisms to characterize relevant interactions and energy scales in
the surface intermetallic CePt$_5$/Pt(111). The experiments provide insight
into crystal field splitting, effective paramagnetic moments, their Kondo
screening and mutual interactions and thus into many aspects which typically
determine the low temperature behavior of correlated rare earth compounds.
Exploiting the tuneability of Ce valence through the thickness dependent
epitaxial strain at the CePt$_5$/Pt(111) interface, we are able to
systematically investigate the impact of hybridization strength on these
interactions. Considerable Kondo screening is indeed observed at all CePt$_5$
thicknesses, and found to be strongest in case of strongest hybridization.
While the magnetic response is commensurate with an impurity Kondo scale of
$T_K \gtrsim 10^2$ K for specimen temperatures $T \gtrsim 30$ K, this is no
longer the case at lower temperature. Its detailed study by XMCD at one
specific thickness of CePt$_5$ reveals an anomaly of the susceptibility at $T^*
\approx 25$ K instead, which we tentatively associate with the onset of lattice
coherence. At lowest temperature we observe paramagnetic saturation with a
small Ce $4f$ saturation magnetization. Within the framework of itinerant $4f$
electrons, saturation is due to a field induced Lifshitz transition involving a
very heavy band with correspondingly small degeneracy temperature of $T_F
\approx 7$ K. This small energy scale results in the persistence of Curie-Weiss
behavior across the entire range of experimentally accessible temperatures ($T
\gtrsim 2$ K). Our work highlights the potential of magnetic circular dichroism
studies in particular for Kondo and heavy fermion materials, which so far has
remained largely unexplored.

follow the dispersion of the trans-Neptunian disk during the giant planet

penetrate into the inner solar system with orbits consistent with the observed
JFC population. The collisional evolution before the giant planet instability
is not considered here. Hence, our study is conservative in its estimation of
the number of collisions. We find that in any scenario considered here, comet
67P/C-G would have experienced a significant number of shape-changing
collisions, if it formed primordially. This is also the case for generic
bi-lobe shapes. Our study also shows that impact heating is very localized and
that collisionally processed bodies can still have a high porosity. Our study

independent renewal processes and after completing service, a customer either
leaves the system or is routed to another queue. This type of customer routing
in queueing networks arises very naturally in many application areas (in
production systems, computer- and communication networks, maintenance, etc.).
In these networks, the single most important characteristic of the system
performance is oftentimes the path time, i.e. the total time spent in the
system by an arbitrary customer traversing a specific path. The current paper
presents the first HT asymptotic for the path-time distribution in queueing
networks with a roving server under general renewal arrivals. In particular, we
provide a strong conjecture for the system's behaviour under HT extending the
conjecture of Coffman et al. [E.G. Coffman Jr., A.A. Puhalskii, M.I. Reiman
1995 and 1998] to the roving server setting of the current paper. By combining
this result with novel light-traffic asymptotics we derive an approximation of
the mean path-time for arbitrary values of the load and renewal arrivals. This
approximation is not only highly accurate for a wide range of parameter
settings, but is also exact in various limiting cases.

static, with nodes linked by fixed infrastructure. To analyze such a potential
network, we propose a grouping method based on node proximity. With the

pairs of nodes. Given an initial topology for the stations, two new point
processes are defined, one for the singles and one for the pairs. We derive
structural characteristics for these processes and analyse the resulting
interference fields. When the node positions follow a Poisson Point Process
(PPP) the processes of singles and pairs are not Poisson. However, the
performance of the original model can be approximated by the superposition of
two PPPs. This allows the derivation of exact expressions for the coverage
probability. Numerical evaluation shows coverage gains from different signal
cooperation that can reach up to 15% compared to the standard noncooperative
coverage. The analysis is general and can be applied to any type of cooperation

link can be part of different paths avoiding different colors. This fact was
previously accounted for with a heuristic approximation. We compare this
approximation with a new, more exact theory and show that the new theory is
substantially more accurate for many avoided colors. Further, we formulate our
new theory with differentiated node functions, as senders/receivers or as
transmitters. In both functions, nodes can be explicitly trusted or avoided.
With only one avoided color we obtain standard percolation. With one by one
avoiding additional colors, we can understand the critical behavior of color
avoiding percolation. For heterogeneous color frequencies, we find that the
colors with the largest frequencies control the critical threshold and
exponent. Colors of small frequencies have only a minor influence on color
avoiding connectivity, thus allowing for approximations.

rollback support. A body of knowledge in the scientific literature about
collaborative model-driven software engineering (MDSE) exists. Still, those
studies are scattered across different independent research areas, such as
software engineering, model-driven engineering languages and systems, model
integrated computing, etc., and a study classifying and comparing the various
approaches and methods for collaborative MDSE is still missing. Under this
perspective, a systematic mapping study (SMS) can help researchers and

architectural model. The model is motivated by the inflexibility and
ossification of today's inter-domain routing system, which renders critical
QoS-constrained end-to-end (e2e) network services difficult or simply
impossible to provide. CXPs operate on slices of ISP networks and are built on
basic Software Defined Networking (SDN) principles, such as the clean
decoupling of the routing control plane from the data plane and the consequent
logical centralization of control. The main goal of the architectural model is
to provide e2e services with QoS constraints across domains. This is achieved
through defining a new type of business relationship between ISPs, which
advertise partial paths (so-called pathlets) with specific properties, and the
orchestrating role of the CXPs, which dynamically stitch them together and
provision e2e QoS. Revenue from value-added services flows from the clients of
the CXP to the ISPs participating in the service. The novelty of the approach
is the combination of SDN programmability and dynamic path stitching techniques
for inter-domain routing, which extends the value proposition of SDN over
multiple domains. We first describe the challenges related to e2e service
provision with the current inter-domain routing and peering model, and then
continue with the benefits of our approach. Subsequently, we describe the CXP
model in detail and report on an initial feasibility analysis.

3D stellar surface convection simulations. The main difference is an expansion
of the atmosphere by 3D convection, expected to explain a major part of the
asteroseismic surface effect; a systematic overestimation of p-mode frequencies
due to inadequate surface physics.
  We employ pairs of 1D stellar envelope models and 3D simulations from a
previous calibration of the mixing-length parameter, alpha. That calibration
constitutes the hitherto most consistent matching of 1D models to 3D
simulations, ensuring that their differences are not spurious, but entirely due
to the 3D nature of convection. The resulting frequency shift is identified as
the structural part of the surface effect. The important, typically
non-adiabatic, modal components of the surface effect are not included in the
present analysis, but relegated to future papers.
  Evaluating the structural surface effect at the frequency of maximum mode
amplitude, $\nu_{\rm max}$, we find shifts from $\delta\nu$=-0.8 microHz for
giants at $\log g$=2.2 to -35 microHz for a ($T_{\rm eff}=6901$ K, $\log

models. Unfortunately, in nonlinear deep networks, not only individual neurons
but also the whole network can saturate, and as a result an important input
feature can have a tiny gradient. We study various networks, and observe that
this phenomena is indeed widespread, across many inputs.
  We propose to examine interior gradients, which are gradients of
counterfactual inputs constructed by scaling down the original input. We apply
our method to the GoogleNet architecture for object recognition in images, as
well as a ligand-based virtual screening network with categorical features and
an LSTM based language model for the Penn Treebank dataset. We visualize how
interior gradients better capture feature importance. Furthermore, interior
gradients are applicable to a wide variety of deep networks, and have the
attribution property that the feature importance scores sum to the the
prediction score.
  Best of all, interior gradients can be computed just as easily as gradients.
In contrast, previous methods are complex to implement, which hinders practical
adoption.

provide inter-domain guarantees, enabling new avenues for innovation, is using
centralized inter-domain routing brokers. These entities centralize routing
control for mission-critical traffic across domains, working in parallel to
BGP. In this work, we propose using IXPs as natural points for stitching
inter-domain paths under the control of inter-domain routing brokers. To
evaluate the potential of this approach, we first map the global substrate of
inter-IXP pathlets that IXP members could offer, based on measurements for 229
IXPs worldwide. We show that using IXPs as stitching points has two useful
properties. Up to 91 % of the total IPv4 address space can be served by such
inter-domain routing brokers when working in concert with just a handful of
large IXPs and their associated ISP members. Second, path diversity on the
inter-IXP graph increases by up to 29 times, as compared to current BGP
valley-free routing. To exploit the rich path diversity, we introduce
algorithms that inter-domain routing brokers can use to embed paths, subject to
bandwidth and latency constraints. We show that our algorithms scale to the
sizes of the measured graphs and can serve diverse simulated path request
mixes. Our work highlights a novel direction for SDN innovation across domains,
based on logically centralized control and programmable IXP fabrics.

The classic work on Hawking radiation indicates that black holes should decay

level are incomplete. Recently Almheiri-Marolf-Polchinski-Sully (AMPS) have
noted an apparent paradox in reconciling fundamental properties of quantum
mechanics with standard beliefs about black holes. One way to resolve the
paradox is to postulate the existence of a ""firewall"" inside the black hole
horizon which prevents objects from falling smoothly toward the singularity. A
fundamental limitation on the behavior of quantum entanglement known as
""monogamy"" plays a key role in the AMPS argument. Our goal is to study and
apply many-body entanglement theory to consider the entanglement among
different parts of Hawking radiation and black holes. Using the multipartite
entanglement measure called negativity, we identify an example which could
change the AMPS accounting of quantum entanglement and perhaps eliminate the
need for a firewall. Specifically, we constructed a toy model for black hole
decay which has different entanglement behavior than that assumed by AMPS. We
discuss the additional steps that would be needed to bring lessons from our toy
model to our understanding of realistic black holes.

in the cosmological Bolshoi simulation. We identify a complete set of 12 unique
evolution channels by which subhaloes evolve in between simulation outputs, and
study their relative importance and demographics. We show that instantaneous
masses and maximum circular velocities of individual subhaloes are extremely
noisy, despite the use of a sophisticated, phase-space-based halo finder. We
also show that subhaloes experience frequent penetrating encounters with other
subhaloes (on average about one per dynamical time), and that subhaloes whose
apo-center lies outside the virial radius of their host (the 'ejected' or
'backsplash' haloes) experience tidal forces that modify their orbits. This
results in an average fractional subhalo exchange rate among host haloes of
roughly 0.01 per Gyr (at the present time). In addition, we show that there are
three distinct disruption channels; one in which subhaloes drop below the mass
resolution limit of the simulation, one in which subhaloes merge with their
host halo largely driven by dynamical friction, and one in which subhaloes
abruptly disintegrate. We estimate that roughly 80 percent of all subhalo
disruption in the Bolshoi simulation is numerical, rather than physical. This
over-merging is a serious road-block for the use of numerical simulations to
interpret small scale clustering, or for any other study that is sensitive to
the detailed demographics of dark matter substructure.

the nebula and the presence of young stellar objects (YSOs) in its environs.
The line emission reveals a clumpy molecular shell, 1.4 pc in radius,
encircling S21. The total molecular mass in the shell amounts to 2900 solar
masses and the original ambient density, 2.1 x 10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$, indicating
that the bubble is evolving in a high density interstellar medium. The image at
24 $\mu$m shows warm dust inside the bubble, while the emission in the range
250 to 870 $\mu$m reveal cold dust in its outskirts, coincident with the
molecular gas. The detection of radio continuun emission indicates that the
bubble is a compact HII region. A search for YSOs using photometric criteria
allowed to identify many candidates projected onto the molecular clumps. We
analize if the collect and collapse process has triggered a new generation of
stars.

well-studied LOCAL model of distributed computing, introduced by Linial [FOCS
'87]. It is widely known that for many of the classic distributed graph
problems (including maximal independent set (MIS) and $(\Delta+1)$-vertex
coloring), the randomized complexity is at most polylogarithmic in the size $n$
of the network, while the best deterministic complexity is typically
$2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}$. Understanding and narrowing down this exponential gap
is considered to be one of the central long-standing open questions in the area
of distributed graph algorithms. We investigate the problem by introducing a
complexity-theoretic framework that allows us to shed some light on the role of
randomness in the LOCAL model. We define the SLOCAL model as a sequential
version of the LOCAL model. Our framework allows us to prove completeness
results with respect to the class of problems which can be solved efficiently
in the SLOCAL model, implying that if any of the complete problems can be
solved deterministically in $\log^{O(1)} n$ rounds in the LOCAL model, we can
deterministically solve all efficient SLOCAL-problems (including MIS and
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring) in $\log^{O(1)} n$ rounds in the LOCAL model. We show
that a rather rudimentary looking graph coloring problem is complete in the
above sense: Color the nodes of a graph with colors red and blue such that each
node of sufficiently large polylogarithmic degree has at least one neighbor of
each color. The problem admits a trivial zero-round randomized solution. The
result can be viewed as showing that the only obstacle to getting efficient
determinstic algorithms in the LOCAL model is an efficient algorithm to
approximately round fractional values into integer values.

first apply data layout transformation from array-of-structures to

reuse and get sustained throughput for a range of problem sizes. We implement
efficient nested threading in B-spline orbital evaluation kernels, paving the
way towards enabling strong scaling of QMC simulations. These optimizations are
portable on four distinct cache-coherent architectures and result in up to 5.6x
performance enhancements on Intel Xeon Phi processor 7250P (KNL), 5.7x on Intel

we have an estimate of the corresponding eigenvalue which is separated from all
other eigenvalues by a minimum gap of magnitude $\Delta$. In the
eigenstate-marking problem (EMP), the goal is to implement a selective phase
transformation of the $|\psi\rangle$ state (known as \emph{marking} the
$|\psi\rangle$ state in the language of the quantum search algorithms). The EMP
finds important applications in the construction of several quantum algorithms.
The best known algorithm for the EMP combines the ideas of the phase estimation
algorithm and the majority-voting. It uses $\Theta(\frac{1}{\Delta}\ln
\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ applications of $U$ where $\epsilon$ is the tolerable
error. It needs $\Theta\left(\ln \frac{1}{\Delta}\right)$ ancilla qubits for
the phase estimation and another $\Theta\left(\ln \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$
ancilla qubits for the majority-voting.
  In this paper, we show that the majority-voting is not a crucial requirement
for the EMP and the same purpose can also be achieved using the fixed-point
quantum search algorithm which does not need any ancilla qubits. In the case of
majority-voting, these ancilla qubits were needed to do controlled
transformations which are harder to implement physically. Using fixed-point
quantum search, we get rid off these $\Theta\left(\ln
\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ ancilla qubits and same number of controlled
transformations. Thus we get a much simpler algorithm for marking the unknown
eigenstates. However, the required number of applications of $U$ increases by
the factor of $\Theta \left(\ln \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$. This tradeoff can
be beneficial in typical situations where spatial resources are more
constrained or where the controlled transformations are very expensive.

goal, and revision, to decompose that goal into low-level, actionable tasks. We
embody this approach in Mechanical Novel, a system that crowdsources short
fiction stories on Amazon Mechanical Turk. In a field experiment, Mechanical
Novel resulted in higher-quality stories than an iterative crowdsourcing
workflow. Our findings suggest that orienting crowd work around high-level
goals may enable workers to coordinate their effort to accomplish complex work.

Recent experiments have shown that chains of Fe atoms on Pb generically have
the required electronic characteristics to form a 1D topological superconductor
and have revealed spatially resolved signatures of localized MQPs at the ends
of such chains. Here we report higher resolution measurements of the same
atomic chain system performed using a dilution refrigerator scanning tunneling
microscope (STM). With significantly better energy resolution than previous
studies, we show that the zero bias peak (ZBP) in Fe chains has no detectable
splitting from hybridization with other states. The measurements also reveal
that the ZBP exhibits a distinctive 'double eye' spatial pattern on nanometer
length scales. Theoretically we show that this is a general consequence of STM
measurements of MQPs with substantial spectral weight in the superconducting
substrate, a conclusion further supported by measurements of Pb overlayers
deposited on top of the Fe chains. Finally, we report experiments performed

understanding the ionization of the Interstellar Medium (ISM), and
extragalactic processes, such as cosmic reionization. We present the ionizing
photon flux and the corresponding photon escape fraction (f$_{esc}$) arising as
a consequence of star cluster formation in a turbulent, 10$^6$ M$_{\odot}$ GMC,
simulated using the code FLASH. We make use of sink particles to represent
young, star-forming clusters coupled with a radiative transfer scheme to
calculate the emergent UV flux. We find that the ionizing photon flux across
the cloud boundary is highly variable in time and space due to the turbulent
nature of the intervening gas. The escaping photon fraction remains at $\sim$5%
for the first 2.5 Myr, followed by two pronounced peaks at 3.25 and 3.8 Myr
with a maximum f$_{esc}$ of 30% and 37%, respectively. These peaks are due to
the formation of large HII regions, that expand into regions of lower density
and some of which reach the cloud surface. However, these phases are short
lived and f$_{esc}$ drops sharply as the HII regions are quenched by the
central cluster passing through high-density material due to the turbulent
nature of the cloud. We find an average f$_{esc}$ of 15% with factor of two
variations over 1 Myr timescales. Our results suggest that assuming a single
value for f$_{esc}$ from a molecular cloud is in general a poor approximation,
and that the dynamical evolution of the system leads to large temporal
variation.

closer to us. Triaxial ellipsoids were fitted to surfaces of a constant number
density. Ellipsoids farther from the LMC center are less elongated and slightly
rotated toward the SMC. The inclination and position angle change significantly
with the $a$ axis size. The median axis ratio is $1:1.23:1.45$.
  The RR Lyrae distribution in the SMC has a very regular, ellipsoidal shape

fitted to surfaces of a constant number density have virtually the same shape

accretion onto the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) is essential for
active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback to work in the most massive galaxies that
lie at the centres of galaxy clusters. Our 3-D hydrodynamic AGN jet-ICM
(intracluster medium) simulations, looking at the detailed angular momentum
distribution of cold gas and its time variability for the first time, show that
the angular momentum of the cold gas crossing $\lesssim 1$ kpc is essentially
isotropic. With almost equal mass in clockwise and counter-clockwise
orientations, we expect a cancellation of angular momentum on roughly the
dynamical time. This means that a compact accretion flow with a short viscous
time ought to form, through which enough accretion power can be channeled into
jet mechanical energy sufficiently quickly to prevent a cooling flow. The
inherent stochasticity, expected in feedback cycles driven by cold gas
condensation, gives rise to a large variation in the cold gas mass at the
centres of galaxy clusters, for similar cluster and SMBH masses, in agreement
with the observations. Such correlations are expected to be much tighter for
the smoother hot/Bondi accretion. The weak correlation between cavity power and
Bondi power obtained from our simulations also match observations.

we assess whether the large scatter can be explained by fluctuations in the

matching the observed scatter at z ~ 5.5 requires a short spatially averaged
mean free path of < 15 comoving Mpc/h, a factor of > 3 shorter than direct
measurements at z ~ 5.2. We argue that such rapid evolution in the mean free
path is difficult to reconcile with our measurements of the global H I
photoionization rate, which stay approximately constant over the interval z ~
4.8 - 5.5. However, we also show that measurements of the mean free path at z >
5 are likely biased towards higher values by the quasar proximity effect. This
bias can reconcile the short values of the mean free path that are required to
explain the large scatter in opacities. We discuss the implications of this
scenario for cosmological reionization. Finally, we investigate whether other
statistics applied to the z > 5 Lyman-alpha forest can shed light on the origin
of the scatter. Compared to a model with a uniform ionizing background, models
that successfully account for the scatter lead to enhanced power in the
line-of-sight flux power spectrum on scales k < 0.1 h/Mpc. We find tentative
evidence for this enhancement in observations of the high-redshift Lyman-alpha

of their orbits suggests that two of these stars may be confined to the
Galactic bulge and one is a halo trespasser, though proper motion values used
to calculate orbits are quite uncertain. An additional two stars in the
globular cluster M22 show [Fe/H] values consistent to within 1 sigma, although
one of these two stars has [Fe/H] = -2.01 +/- 0.09, which is on the low end for

it will typically reduce the significance of this signal. We emphasize that
this new {\it smoking gun in motion} signature of dark matter is general, and

coated grains are significantly less susceptible to fragmentation than their

therefore on the location of dead zones. In comparison to a simple constant

predicts an outer dead zone edge that moves in by a factor of about 3 at 1 Myr

introduce anisotropy in this setup by strongly confining the gas in one of the
directions with relatively weak confinement in the remaining directions. This
system has a close resemblance to anisotropic strongly coupled field theories
studied recently in the context of gauge-gravity duality. Computations in such
theories (which have gravity duals) revealed that some of the viscosity
components of the anisotropic shear viscosity tensor can be made much smaller
than the entropy density, thus parametrically violating the bound proposed by
Kovtun, Son and Starinets (KSS): $\frac {\eta} {s} \geq \frac{1}{4 \pi}$. A
Boltzmann analysis performed in a system of weakly interacting particles in a
linear potential also shows that components of the viscosity tensor can be
reduced. Motivated by these exciting results, we propose two hydrodynamic modes
in the unitary Fermi gas whose damping is governed by the component of shear
viscosity expected to violate the KSS bound. One of these modes is the well
known scissor mode. We estimate trap parameters for which the reduction in the
shear viscosity is of order unity and find that the trap geometry, the damping
timescales, and mode amplitudes are within the range of existing experimental
setups on ultra-cold Fermi gases.

case. On one hand, it is known that oriented 3d TFTs having a topological
boundary condition admit a state-sum construction known as the Turaev-Viro
construction. This is related to the string-net construction of fermionic
phases of matter. We show how Turaev-Viro construction can be generalized to
unoriented 3d TFTs. On the other hand, it is known that the ""fermionic""
versions of oriented TFTs, known as Spin-TFTs, can be constructed in terms of
""shadow"" TFTs which are ordinary oriented TFTs with an anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_2$
1-form symmetry. We generalize this correspondence to Pin$^+$-TFTs by showing
that they can be constructed in terms of ordinary unoriented TFTs with
anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ 1-form symmetry having a mixed anomaly with
time-reversal symmetry. The corresponding Pin$^+$-TFT does not have any anomaly
for time-reversal symmetry however and hence it can be unambiguously defined on
a non-orientable manifold. In case a Pin$^+$-TFT admits a topological boundary
condition, one can combine the above two statements to obtain a
Turaev-Viro-like construction of Pin$^+$-TFTs. As an application of these
ideas, we construct a large class of Pin$^+$-SPT phases.

the VAE only ""autoencodes"" data in a lossy fashion. In addition, by leveraging
autoregressive models as both prior distribution $p(z)$ and decoding

of VAEs, achieving new state-of-the-art results on MNIST, OMNIGLOT and

techniques rely on integrity constraints as a benchmark to identify and correct

flagged as dirty, and data updates are made to re-align the data and the
constraints. However, many errors often require user input to resolve due to
domain expertise defining specific terminology and relationships. For example,
in pharmaceuticals, 'Advil' \emph{is-a} brand name for 'ibuprofen' that can be

traditionally been used in existing data cleaning solutions to model syntactic

defined by an ontology. In this paper, we take a first step towards extending
the set of data quality constraints used in data cleaning by defining and
discovering \emph{Ontology Functional Dependencies} (OFDs). We lay out
theoretical and practical foundations for OFDs, including a set of sound and
complete axioms, and a linear inference procedure. We then develop effective

prune the search space. Our experimental evaluation using real data show the

this map converges towards a piecewise linear discontinuous map whose orbits

including vision, robotics, probabilistic inference, and machine learning.
Unfortunately, most real-world optimization problems are nonconvex, causing
standard convex techniques to find only local optima, even with extensions like
random restarts and simulated annealing. We observe that, in many cases, the
local modes of the objective function have combinatorial structure, and thus
ideas from combinatorial optimization can be brought to bear. Based on this, we
propose a problem-decomposition approach to nonconvex optimization. Similarly
to DPLL-style SAT solvers and recursive conditioning in probabilistic
inference, our algorithm, RDIS, recursively sets variables so as to simplify
and decompose the objective function into approximately independent
sub-functions, until the remaining functions are simple enough to be optimized
by standard techniques like gradient descent. The variables to set are chosen
by graph partitioning, ensuring decomposition whenever possible. We show
analytically that RDIS can solve a broad class of nonconvex optimization
problems exponentially faster than gradient descent with random restarts.
Experimentally, RDIS outperforms standard techniques on problems like structure
from motion and protein folding.

Lagrangian, conservative, and fully time-reversible. IL complements other
existing methods, such as N-body/particle mesh (computationally efficient, but
affected by Monte-Carlo sampling noise and two-body relaxation) and finite
volume (FV) direct integration schemes (expensive, accurate but diffusive). We
also present improvements to the FV scheme, using a moving mesh approach

Being a direct integration scheme like FV, IL is memory limited (memory

Instead,
it is common that their low-energy behavior is a sigma model with a target
space. When this target space is compact its renormalization group flow is
standard. When it is non-compact the continuous spectrum of operators can
change the qualitative behavior. Here we discuss two-dimensional gauge theories
with N=(2,2) supersymmetry. We focus on two specific theories, for which we
argue that they flow to free chiral multiplets at low energies: the U(1) gauge
theory with one flavor (two chiral superfields with charges plus and minus one)
and a non-zero Fayet-Iliopoulos term, and pure SU(N) gauge theories. We argue
that the renormalization group flow of these theories has an interesting order
of limits issue. Holding the position on the target space fixed, the space
flattens out under the renormalization group. On the other hand, if we first go
to infinity on the target space and then perform the renormalization group, we
always have a non-trivial space, e.g. a cone with a deficit angle. We explain
how to interpret low-energy dualities between theories with non-compact target
spaces. We expect a similar qualitative behavior also for other non-compact
sigma models, even when they do not flow to free theories.

configuration-interaction method (ISCI). The rigorous IIS in the IISCC gives a
robust and adjustable error control which should allow for the possibility of
converging the energy without any loss of accuracy while retaining low or
linear scaling at the same time. The derivation of the IISCC is performed in a
similar fashion as in the ISCI where we show that the tensor contractions for
the nested commutators are separable up to an overall sign and that this
separability can lead to a rigorous IIS. In the nested commutators the
integrals are screened in the first tensor contraction and the intermediates
are screened in all successive tensor contractions. The rigorous IIS will lead
to linear scaling for all nested commutators for large systems in a similar way
as seen for the ISCI. The reduced scaling can in this way be obtained without
any range dependent parameter for the interaction, unlike other low scaling
methods and is therefore also suitable for charge separated systems. It is
expected that the IISCC, just like the ISCI, can use dramatically larger
orbital spaces combined with large CC expansions as compared with traditional
CC methods. Due to the size extensive nature of the CC method the IISCC should
not only be applicable to few electron systems but also to large molecular
system unlike the ISCI. The IISCC can here either be used as a stand alone
method or combined with other linear scaling approaches like the fragmentation
method or other methods which introduces a range dependent interaction
screening.

adversarial examples, which can transfer among different architectures. These
transferable adversarial examples may severely hinder deep neural network-based
applications. Previous works mostly study the transferability using small scale
datasets. In this work, we are the first to conduct an extensive study of the
transferability over large models and a large scale dataset, and we are also
the first to study the transferability of targeted adversarial examples with
their target labels. We study both non-targeted and targeted adversarial
examples, and show that while transferable non-targeted adversarial examples
are easy to find, targeted adversarial examples generated using existing
approaches almost never transfer with their target labels. Therefore, we
propose novel ensemble-based approaches to generating transferable adversarial
examples. Using such approaches, we observe a large proportion of targeted
adversarial examples that are able to transfer with their target labels for the
first time. We also present some geometric studies to help understanding the
transferable adversarial examples. Finally, we show that the adversarial
examples generated using ensemble-based approaches can successfully attack

sophisticated behaviors automatically; however, the learning process requires a
huge number of trials. In contrast, animals can learn new tasks in just a few
trials, benefiting from their prior knowledge about the world. This paper seeks
to bridge this gap. Rather than designing a ""fast"" reinforcement learning
algorithm, we propose to represent it as a recurrent neural network (RNN) and
learn it from data. In our proposed method, RL$^2$, the algorithm is encoded in
the weights of the RNN, which are learned slowly through a general-purpose
(""slow"") RL algorithm. The RNN receives all information a typical RL algorithm
would receive, including observations, actions, rewards, and termination flags;
and it retains its state across episodes in a given Markov Decision Process
(MDP). The activations of the RNN store the state of the ""fast"" RL algorithm on
the current (previously unseen) MDP. We evaluate RL$^2$ experimentally on both
small-scale and large-scale problems. On the small-scale side, we train it to
solve randomly generated multi-arm bandit problems and finite MDPs. After
RL$^2$ is trained, its performance on new MDPs is close to human-designed
algorithms with optimality guarantees. On the large-scale side, we test RL$^2$
on a vision-based navigation task and show that it scales up to
high-dimensional problems.

(AB) magnitude in Swift UV band (1928A) at -11days pre-maximum. Assuming an
exponential form, we derived the rise time of 33days and the peak bolometric
luminosity of 3x10^{44}ergs^-1. At maximum light, the estimated photospheric
temperature and velocity are 17,000K and 14,000kms^-1 respectively. The
inferred radiative and kinetic energy are roughly 1x10^{51} and 2x10^{52}erg.
Gaia16apd is extremely UV luminous, emitting 50% of its total luminosity at
1000 - 2500A. Compared to the UV spectra (normalized at 3100A) of well studied
SN1992A (Ia), SN2011fe(Ia), SN1999em (IIP) and SN1993J (IIb), it has orders of
magnitude more far-UV emission. This excess is interpreted primarily as a
result of weaker metal line blanketing due to much lower abundance of
iron-group elements in the outer ejecta. Because these elements originate
either from the natal metallicity of the star, or have been newly produced, our
observation provides direct evidence that little of these freshly synthesized
material, including 56Ni, was mixed into the outer ejecta, and the progenitor
metallicity is likely sub-solar. This disfavors Pair-Instability Supernova
(PISN) models with Helium core masses >=90Msun, where substantial 56Ni material
is produced. Higher photospheric temperature of Gaia16apd than that of normal
SNe may also contribute to the observed far-UV excess. We find some indication
that UV luminous SLSNe-I like Gaia16apd could be common. Using the UV spectra,
we show that WFIRST could detect SLSNe-I out to redshift of 8.

method is the orchestration of silent delivery campaigns, which involve a group
of downloaders that receive remote commands and that deliver their payloads
without any user interaction. These campaigns have not been characterized
systematically, unlike other aspects of malware delivery networks. Moreover,
silent delivery campaigns can evade detection by relying on inconspicuous
downloaders on the client side and on disposable domain names on the server
side. We describe Beewolf, a system for detecting silent delivery campaigns
from Internet-wide records of download events. The key observation behind our
system is that the downloaders involved in these campaigns frequently retrieve
payloads in lockstep. Beewolf identifies such locksteps in an unsupervised and
deterministic manner. By exploiting novel techniques and empirical
observations, Beewolf can operate on streaming data. We utilize Beewolf to
study silent delivery campaigns at scale, on a data set of 33.3 million
download events. This investigation yields novel findings, e.g. malware
distributed through compromised software update channels, a substantial overlap
between the delivery ecosystems for malware and unwanted software, and several
types of business relationships within these ecosystems. Beewolf achieves over

detect suspicious downloaders a median of 165 days ahead of existing anti-virus

a challenge to the cold dark matter paradigm due to their number and proximity
to the cluster centre. We use one of the biggest N-body simulations, the
Millennium XXL, to investigate the substructure in a large sample of massive
dark matter haloes. A range of effects which influence the comparison with the
observations is considered, extending the preliminary evaluation carried out by
Jauzac et al. (2016). There are many tens of haloes in the simulation with a
total mass comparable with or larger than that of Abell 2744. However, we find
no haloes with a number and distribution of massive substructures (> 5 10^13
Msun) that is close to that inferred from the observations of Abell 2744. The
application of extreme value statistics suggests that we would need a
simulation of at least ten times the volume of the Millennium XXL to find a
single dark matter halo with a similar internal structure to Abell 2744.
Explaining the distribution of massive substructures in clusters is a new
hurdle for hierarchical models to negotiate, which is not weakened by appeals
to baryonic physics or uncertainty over the nature of the dark matter particle.

generalized Rosenblatt process as these critical exponents approach the
boundaries of the triangle? We show by two different methods that on each of
the two symmetric boundaries, the limit is non-Gaussian. On the third boundary,
the limit is Brownian motion. The rates of convergence to these boundaries are
also given. The situation is particularly delicate as one approaches the
corners of the triangle, because the limit process will depend on how these

$C[0,1]$. These limits cannot be strengthened to convergence in $L^2(\Omega)$.

Demonstrations of quantum key distribution and quantum teleportation using

such as non-Gaussian operations for entanglement distillation and an iterative
Gaussification protocol (for retaining the Gaussian character of the final

reinforcement learning (RL) to generate higher-quality outputs that account for
domain-specific incentives while retaining proximity to the prior policy of the

opportunity to probe its size and shape. Very few occultations by TNOs have
been sampled simultaneously from multiple locations, while a robust estimation
of shadow size has been possible for only two objects. We present the first
observation of an occultation by the TNO 2007 UK126 on 15 November 2014,
measured by three observers, one nearly on and two almost symmetrical to the
shadow's centerline. This is the first multi-chord dataset obtained for a
so-called detached object, a TNO subgroup with perihelion distances so large
that the giant planets have likely not perturbed their orbits. We revisit
Herschel/PACS far-infrared data, applying a new reduction method to improve the
accuracy of the measured fluxes. Combining both datasets allows us to
comprehensively characterize 2007 UK126. We use error-in-variable regression to
solve the non-linear problem of propagating timing errors into uncertainties of
the ellipse parameters. Based on the shadow's size and a previously reported
rotation period, we expect a shape of a Maclaurin spheroid and derive a
geometrically plausible size range. To refine our size estimate of 2007 UK126,
we model its thermal emission using a thermophysical model code. We conduct a
parametric study to predict far-infrared fluxes and compare them to the
Herschel/PACS measurements. The favorable geometry of our occultation chords,
combined with minimal dead-time imaging, and precise GPS time measurements,
allow for an accurate estimation of the shadow size (best-fitting ellipse with
axes 645.80 $\pm$ 5.68 km $\times$ 597.81 $\pm$ 12.74 km) and the visual
geometric albedo (15.0 $\pm$ 1.6 %). By combining our analyses of the
occultation and the far-infrared data, we can constrain the effective diameter
of 2007 UK126 to 599 - 629 km. We conclude that subsolar surface temperatures
are $\approx$ 50 - 55 K.

determined by the strength of interfacial interaction. The MX2/CeO2

subspaces and noiseless subsystems, are of great practical importance to the
end of quantum information processing. Yet, it is a difficult problem to find
steady-state manifolds of open quantum systems, especially of non-Markovian

manifolds, which is generally applicable to both Markovian and non-Markovian
systems. Our approach is based on an arbitrarily given steady state, and by
following the standard steps of the approach, the steady-state manifold on the
support subspace of the given state can be obtained. Our work reduces the
problem of finding a manifold of steady states to that of finding only one
steady state, which is indeed an interesting progress towards completely
solving the difficult problem. Besides, in deriving our approach, we introduce
the notions of the modified noise algebra and its commutant, and prove two
theorems on the structure of steady-state manifolds of general open systems,

balancing important covariates is often one of the most important concerns for

adaptively, using information on the current level of imbalance and the

remove the subjective evaluation, and one identification stage to reduce the
analysis time. A 82.87% of correct segmentation in average is reached.
Meanwhile the identification algorithm is achieved with euclidean distance

radio, spanning a range of luminosities that were poorly covered during its
previous outburst in 1989 (our 2015 campaign covers 2e33<Lx<1e34 erg/s). During
our 2015 campaign, the X-ray spectrum evolved rapidly from a hard photon index
of Gamma~1.6 (at Lx~1e34 erg/s) to a softer Gamma~2 (at Lx~3e33 erg/s). We
argue that V404 Cygni reaching Gamma~2 marks the beginning of the quiescent

the average pre-outburst luminosity of ~8e32 erg/s. V404 Cygni falls along the
same radio/X-ray luminosity correlation that it followed during its previous

possibility that a synchrotron cooled jet dominates the X-ray emission in
quiescence, leaving synchrotron self-Compton from either a hot accretion flow
or from a radiatively cooled jet as the most likely sources of X-ray radiation,
and/or particle acceleration along the jet becoming less efficient in
quiescence. Finally, we present the first indications of correlated radio and
X-ray variability on minute timescales in quiescence, tentatively measuring the
radio emission to lag the X-ray by 15+/-4 min, suggestive of X-ray variations
propagating down a jet of length <3.0 AU.

exploits overlapped transmissions to boost the throughput of wireless relay
networks. A high point of PNC research was a theoretical proof that PNC that
makes use of lattice codes could approach the information-theoretic capacity of
a two-way relay network (TWRN), where two end nodes communicate via a relay
node. The capacity cannot be achieved by conventional methods of time-division
or straightforward network coding. Many practical challenges, however, remain
to be addressed before the full potential of lattice-coded PNC can be realized.
Two major challenges are: for good performance in lattice-coded PNC, channels
of simultaneously transmitting nodes must be aligned; for lattice-coded PNC to
be practical, the complexity of lattice encoding at the transmitters and
lattice decoding at the receiver must be reduced. We address these challenges
and implement a first lattice-coded PNC system on a software-defined radio
platform. Specifically, we design and implement a low-overhead channel
precoding system that accurately aligns the channels of distributed nodes. In
our implementation, the nodes only use low-cost temperature-compensated
oscillators---a consequent challenge is that the channel alignment must be done
more frequently and more accurately compared with the use of expensive
oscillators. The low overhead and accurate channel alignment are achieved by
(1)a channel precoding system implemented over FPGA to realize fast feedback of
channel state information; (2)a highly-accurate carrier frequency offset
estimation method; and (3)a partial-feedback channel estimation method that
significantly reduces the feedback information from the receiver to the
transmitters for channel precoding at the transmitters. To reduce lattice
encoding and decoding complexities, we adapt the low-density lattice code for
use in PNC systems.

The correlation of strain to the decrement in vacancy sites is discussed in

conductive oxides (TCOs) are important components which conduct electrically
without absorbing visible light. Known TCOs are extremely costly and are
composed of non-abundant elements. Search for new ecofriendly, cheap and
sustainable TCOs has been a recent research of attraction. Keeping in mind that
most solar cells are exposed to natural conditions, the humidity tolerance
becomes a determining factor. We report that sensitivity to moisture decreases
drastically while the conductivity and optical transparency increases with
doping. The reduction of strain and improvement of transport properties results
in increased conductivity of Si doped ZnO pellets, tempting us to envisage this

higgsinos not too far above the mass of the $Z$ boson. The small mass
splittings amongst the higgsinos -- typically 5-20\,GeV -- imply very little
visible energy release from decays of heavier higgsinos. In particular, if
other SUSY particles are quite heavy, as can be the case in SUSY with
radiatively-driven naturalness, the higgsinos are extremely hard to detect at
hadron colliders. The clean environment of electron-positron colliders with
$\sqrt{s} > 2m_{\mathrm{higgsino}}$, however, would allow for a decisive search
for the required light higgsinos. Thus, $e^+e^-$ colliders should either
discover or exclude natural SUSY. We present a detailed study of higgsino pair
production at the proposed International Linear $e^+e^-$ Collider which is
under consideration for construction in Japan. A variety of precision
measurements should allow for extraction of underlying parameters and provide a
window onto physics at the grand unified scale.

crystal structures, to manipulate nanoparticles and cells, or to control
chemical reactions. The magneto-elastic (ME) effect--the change of magnetic
properties caused by the elastic deformation (strain) of a magnetic
material--has been proposed as an alternative approach to magnetic fields for
the low power control of magnetization states of nanoelements since it avoids
charge currents, which entail ohmic losses. Multiferroic heterostructures
\cite{Zheng2004} and nanocomposites have exploited this effect in search of
electric control of magnetic states, mostly in the static regime. Quantitative
studies combining strain and magnetization dynamics are needed for practical
applications and so far, a high resolution technique for this has been lacking.
Here, we have studied the effect of the dynamic strain accompanying a surface
acoustic wave on magnetic nanostructures. We have simultaneously imaged the
temporal evolution of both strain waves and magnetization dynamics of
nanostructures at the picosecond timescale. The newly developed experimental
technique, based on X-ray microscopy, is versatile and provides a pathway to
the study of strain-induced effects at the nanoscale. Our results provide
fundamental insight in the coupling between strain and magnetization in
nanostructures at the picosecond timescale, having implications in the design
of strain-controlled magnetostrictive nano-devices.

provide inverse and identity operators while maintaining differentiability. To
experiment with this approach, we implement a simplified Lie-access neural

scientific frontier, its use in real-world applications beyond the laboratory

frequency comb, have recently emerged as a candidate solution to the challenge
because of their preferable size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP). On the
other hand, the current phase stabilization technology requires either external
optical references or power-demanding nonlinear processes, overturning the SWaP
benefit of Kerr frequency combs. Introducing a new concept in phase control,
here we report an internally phase stabilized Kerr frequency comb without the

generation analytically with the theory of cavity induced modulation
instability, and demonstrate for the first time that the optical frequency can

comb offset and the comb spacing. Both parameters are phase locked to microwave
references, with 55 mrad and 20 mrad residual phase noises, and the resulting
comb-to-comb frequency uncertainty is 0.08 Hz or less. Out-of-loop measurements
confirm good coherence and stability across the comb, with measured optical

has answered this question positively, in the form of the Plug-and-Play Prior

applying image denoising steps. This relies heavily on the ADMM optimization

  Is this the only way in which tasks in image processing can exploit the image

multilayers with different thickness of the ferromagnetic permalloy layer. An
effective FM-AFM interaction mediated via the conduction electrons in the
nonmagnetic Cu spacer -- the spin-pumping effect -- is detected as an increase
in the linewidth of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectra and a shift of
the resonant magnetic field. We further find experimentally that the
spin-pumping-induced contribution to the linewidth is inversely proportional to
the thickness of the Py layer. We show that this thickness dependence likely
originates from the dissipative dynamics of the free and localized spins in the

properties of spintronic devices incorporating antiferromagnetic layers.

tendencies for structures with stacking faults cannot be simply interpreted by
arithmetic average of SRO for constituent fcc and hcp stackings, indicating
that the SRO should be significantly affected by periodically-introduced
stacking faults. We also find that SRO for neighboring Y-Zn pair, which should
have positive sign to form specific L12 type cluster found in LPSO, is strongly
affected by the distance between stacking faults: e.g., five atomic layer
distance does not prefer in-plane Y-Zn pair, while seven atomic layer distance
prefer both in- and inter-plane Y-Zn pair. These facts strongly indicate that
ordering tendency for the Mg-Y-Zn alloy is significantly dominated by the
stacking faults as well as their periodicity. We also systematically
investigate correlation between SRO for other Mg-RE-Zn (RE = La, Tb, Dy, Ho,
Er) alloys and the physical property of RE elements. We find that while SRO for
RE-Zn pair does not show effective correlation with atomic radius, it has
strong quadratic correlation with atomic radius considering unisotoropy along

this picture, overdensities of galaxies are expected around high redshift

the uncertain redshift constraints of LBGs, which are selected through

the quasar field with respect to blank field studies. Possible explanations for
these findings include that our survey volume is too small, or that the strong
ionizing radiation from the quasar hinders galaxy formation in its immediate

A compact radio knot with non-thermal spectral index is detected towards the
centre of the cloud. Mid-infrared data from the Spitzer Legacy Survey of the
Cygnus-X region show the presence of six Class I YSOs inside the cloud. Thermal
dust emission in this complex is modelled using Herschel far-infrared data to
generate dust temperature and column density maps. Herschel images also show
the presence of two clumps in this region, the masses of which are estimated to
be {\sim} 175 M{\sun} and 30 M{\sun}. The mass-radius relation and the surface
density of the clumps do not qualify them as massive star forming sites. An
overall picture of a runaway star ionizing the cloud and a triggered population
of intermediate-mass, Class I sources located toward the cloud centre emerges
from this multiwavelength study. Variation in the dust emissivity spectral
index is shown to exist in this region and is seen to have an inverse relation

uniform over the whole system, with a dispersion sigma_12+log(O/H/)=0.08, lower

between exposure and counterparty credit risk, known as Wrong-Way Risk (WWR).
At this time, addressing WWR in a both sound and tractable way remains
challenging: arbitrage-free setups have been proposed by academic research
through dynamic models but are computationally intensive and hard to use in
practice. Tractable alternatives based on resampling techniques have been
proposed by the industry, but they lack mathematical foundations. This probably
explains why WWR is not explicitly handled in the Basel III regulatory
framework in spite of its acknowledged importance. The purpose of this paper is
to propose a new method consisting of an appealing compromise: we start from a
stochastic intensity approach and end up with a pricing problem where WWR does
not enter the picture explicitly. This result is achieved thanks to a set of
changes of measure: the WWR effect is now embedded in the drift of the
exposure, and this adjustment can be approximated by a deterministic function
without affecting the level of accuracy typically required for CVA figures. The
performances of our approach are illustrated through an extensive comparison of
Expected Positive Exposure (EPE) profiles and CVA figures produced either by
(i) the standard method relying on a full bivariate Monte Carlo framework and
(ii) our drift-adjustment approximation. Given the uncertainty inherent to CVA,
the proposed method is believed to provide a promising way to handle WWR in a
sound and tractable way.

considered in this contribution, i.e., as a solution for small cell

very attractive given how pervasive the power line infrastructure is. Telecom
operators are looking for solutions that can handle the traffic increase which
is doublying every year. This calls for improvements of both cellular systems
and front-hauling technologies that have to bridge the radio network with the
core network. Small cells are currently advocated as the solution to spatially
fragment the network and offer high capacity in densely populated areas; this
is also due to the availability of spectrum at high frequency (mmWave links)
which inherently offers large bandwidth but forces the cells to become smaller
due to the short distance coverage. Therefore, it appears that mobile operators
may eventually have to deploy an order of magnitude more (small) cells compared
to existing networks having macro cells. This translates in a high density

related implementations of quasi-degenerate perturbation theory (QDPT) model
space techniques. Our model space is built either from uncontracted,
large-scale scalar relativistic MRCISD wavefunctions or based on the
scalar-relativistic solutions of the linear-response-theory-based
multi-configurational averaged quadratic coupled cluster method (LRT-MRAQCC).
The latter approach allows for a consistent, approximatively size-consistent
and size-extensive treatment of spin-orbit coupling. The approach is described
in detail and compared to a number of related techniques. The inherent accuracy
of the QDPT approach is validated by comparing cuts of the potential energy
surfaces of acrolein and its S, Se, and Te analoga with the corresponding data
obtained from matching fully variational spin-orbit MRCISD calculations. The
conceptual availability of approximate analytic gradients with respect to
geometrical displacements is an attractive feature of the 2c-QDPT-MRCISD and

specifying and reasoning about preferences. CI-nets, in particular, are a

which are typically required to be monotonic.
  Considering also that goods often come in multi-sets rather than sets, a
natural question is whether CI-nets can be used more or less directly to encode
preferences over multi-sets. We here provide some initial ideas on how to
achieve this, in the sense that at least a restricted form of reasoning on our
framework, which we call ""confined reasoning"", can be efficiently reduced to
reasoning on CI-nets. Our framework nevertheless allows for encoding
preferences over multi-sets with unbounded multiplicities. We also show the

Consequently, different RF-DA methods have been proposed, which not only
require target-domain samples but revisiting the source-domain ones, too. As
novelty, we propose three inherently different methods (Node-Adapt, Path-Adapt

few target-domain samples for DA, i.e. source-domain samples do not need to be

competitive patch-based pedestrian model. We test our Node-, Path- and
Tree-Adapt methods in standard benchmarks, showing that DA is largely achieved.

only the quiescence, but also the transitional, outburst, and super-outburst

emission from the boundary layer, we made several modifications to account for
the observed spectra. As a result, we found that the best-fit spectral model
depends strongly on the state of the DNe with only a few exceptions. Spectra in
the quiescent state are explained by the cooling flow model plus a Fe
fluorescent line emission attenuated by an interstellar extinction. Spectra in
the transitional state require an additional partial covering extinction.
Spectra in the outburst and super-outburst state require additional
low-temperature thin-thermal plasma component(s). Spectra in the super-outburst
state further require a high value of the minimum temperature of the boundary

We focus here on a particularly intense episode preceeding a definitive decline
of the source activity. We benefit from large signal-to-noise ratios to
investigate the source spectral variability on a timescale of 5 minutes. A
Hardness-Intensity study of three broad bands reveals clearly different
behaviors at low and high energy (below and above around 100 keV). In
particular, on two occasions, the source intensity varies by a factor of 3-4 in
amplitude while keeping the same spectral shape. On the other hand, at the end
of the major flare, the emission presents a clear anticorrelation between flux
and hardness. These behaviors strongly suggest the presence of two spectral
components related to emission processes varying in a largely independent way.
The first component (E < 100-150 keV) is classically identified with a
Comptonizing thermal electron population and requires either an unusual seed
photon population or a specific geometry with strong absorbing/reflecting
material. The second component is modeled by a cutoff power-law, which could
correspond to a second hotter Comptonizing population or another mechanism
(synchrotron, non-thermal Comptonization...). In the framework of such a model,
Hardness-Intensity and Flux-Flux diagrams clearly demonstrate that the source
evolution follows a well organized underlying scheme. They reveal unique

penalizes jumps of velocity and pressure gradients over inter-element faces to
counteract instabilities arising for high local Reynolds numbers and the use of
equal order interpolation spaces for the velocity and pressure. Since the mesh
does not fit the boundary, Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed weakly by
a stabilized Nitsche-type approach. The addition of CIP-like ghost-penalties in
the boundary zone allows to prove that our method is inf-sup stable and to
derive optimal order a priori error estimates in an energy-type norm,
irrespective of how the boundary cuts the underlying mesh. All applied
stabilization techniques are developed with particular emphasis on low and high
Reynolds numbers. Two- and three-dimensional numerical examples corroborate the
theoretical findings. Finally, the proposed method is applied to solve the
transient incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a complex geometry.

numerous observational and theoretical efforts, the nature of such flares still
remains poorly understood, although a few phenomenological scenarios have been
proposed. In this work, we develop the Yuan et al. (2009) scenario into a
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model for Sgr A$^\star$ flares. This model is
analogous with the theory of solar flares and coronal mass ejection in solar
physics. In the model, magnetic field loops emerge from the accretion flow onto
Sgr A$^\star$ and are twisted to form flux ropes because of shear and
turbulence. The magnetic energy is also accumulated in this process until a
threshold is reached. This then results in a catastrophic evolution of a flux
rope with the help of magnetic reconnection in the current sheet. In this
catastrophic process, the magnetic energy is partially converted into the
energy of non-thermal electrons. We have quantitatively calculated the
dynamical evolution of the height, size, and velocity of the flux rope, as well
as the magnetic field in the flare regions, and the energy distribution of
relativistic electrons in this process. We further calculate the synchrotron
radiation from these electrons and compare the obtained light curves with the
observed ones. We find that the model can reasonably explain the main
observations of near-infrared (NIR) and X-ray flares including their light
curves and spectra. It can also potentially explain the frequency-dependent
time delay seen in radio flare light curves.

partition, and estimate when job output will be available to plan for next
experiments. Apart from wasting infrastructure resources by making wrong
allocation decisions, overall user response time can also be negatively
impacted. Techniques that exploit batch scheduler systems to predict waiting
time and runtime of user jobs have already been proposed. However, we observed
that such techniques are not suitable for predicting job memory usage. In this
paper we introduce a tool to help users predict their memory requirements using
machine learning. We describe the integration of the tool with a batch
scheduler system, discuss how batch scheduler log data can be exploited to
generate memory usage predictions through machine learning, and present results
of two production systems containing thousands of jobs.

  In this paper we address full first-order reasoning about properties of

extension of the theory of term algebras using a finite number of statements,
while our second method relies on extending the superposition calculus of

able to find proofs for many hard problems previously unsolved by

challenge in human genetics, especially when the causes are plural and not
clearly identified. Although the literature regarding heritability estimation
for binary traits is less rich than for quantitative traits, several methods
have been proposed to estimate the heritability of complex diseases. However,
to the best of our knowledge, the existing methods are not supported by

the oversampling of the number of patients compared to controls. We propose in

eNodeB energy consumption, has been overlooked. In this regard, for the first

which only allows ensemble measurement through wide-field detection. For
imaging fluorometers, the typical spatial and temporal resolutions are on the
order of millimeter and second, far from enough to study cellular/sub-cellular
CF dynamics. In addition, due to the lack of optical sectioning capability,
conventional imaging fluorometers cannot identify CF from a single cell or even
a single chloroplast. Here we demonstrated a novel fluorometer based on
confocal imaging, that not only provides high contrast images, but also allows
CF measurement with spatiotemporal resolution as high as micrometer and
millisecond. CF transient (the Kautsky curve) from a single chloroplast is
successfully obtained, with both the temporal dynamics and the intensity
dependences corresponding well to the ensemble measurement from conventional
studies. The significance of confocal imaging fluorometer is to identify the
variation among individual chloroplasts, e.g. the half-life period of the slow
decay in the Kautsky curve, that is not possible to analyze with wide-field
techniques. A linear relationship is found between excitation Intensity and the
temporal positions of peaks/valleys in the Kautsky curve. In addition, an
interesting 6-order increase in excitation intensity is found between
wide-field and confocal fluorometers, whose pixel integration time and optical
sectioning may account for this substantial difference. Confocal imaging
fluorometers provide micrometer and millisecond CF characterization, opening up
unprecedented possibilities toward detailed spatiotemporal analysis of CF
transients and its propagation dynamics, as well as photosynthesis efficiency
analysis, on the scale of organelles, in a living plant.

dust is poorly coupled to the gas. In protoplanetary discs, it is well known
that this decoupling of the dust and gas can lead to diverse spatial structures
and dust-to-gas ratios. In this paper, we study the dynamics of dust and gas
during the earlier phase of protostellar collapse, before a protoplanetary disc
is formed. We find that for dust grains with sizes < 10 micron, the dust is
well coupled during the collapse of a rotating, pre-stellar core and there is
little variation of the dust-to-gas ratio during the collapse. However, if
larger grains are present, they may have trajectories that are very different
from the gas during the collapse, leading to mid-plane settling and/or
oscillations of the dust grains through the mid-plane. This may produce
variations in the dust-to-gas ratio and very different distributions of large
and small dust grains at the very earliest stages of star formation, if large
grains are present in pre-stellar cores.

to partition the elements of the coarse mesh such that (a) the fine mesh can be

develop in detail how each process computes the communication pattern for the

the corrections to the power spectra. We go beyond the de Sitter case discussed

Typically, a drug takes effect via its protein targets in the cell. As a

diseases. Although previous studies have made a strong case for the
effectiveness of integrative network-based methods for predicting these

drug repositioning research. Moreover, the interactions of new drugs and

graphs in which hidden variables determine the pairwise connections between
vertices. The class rules out self-loops and multiple edges and allows for
negative degree correlations (disassortative mixing) due to infinite-variance
degrees controlled by a structural cutoff $h_s$ and natural cutoff $h_c$. We
show that local clustering decreases with the hidden variable (or degree). We
also determine how the average clustering coefficient $C$ scales with the
network size $N$, as a function of $h_s$ and $h_c$. For scale-free networks
with exponent $2<\tau<3$ and the default choices $h_s\sim N^{1/2}$ and $h_c\sim
N^{1/(\tau-1)}$ this gives $C\sim N^{2-\tau}\ln N$ for the universality class
at hand. We characterize the extremely slow decay of $C$ when $\tau\approx 2$
and show that for $\tau=2.1$, say, clustering only starts to vanish for
networks as large as $N=10^{11}$.

Cross-Lingual WSD - where the word senses of a word in a source language e come

finite volume (FV) discretization in the numerical solution of general 1D and
2D forward Kolmogorov equations. The FV method does not require a
transformation of the PDE. This constitutes a main advantage in the calibration
of SLV models as the pertinent PDE coefficients are often nonsmooth. Moreover,
the FV discretization has the crucial property that the total numerical mass is
conserved. Applying the FV discretization in the calibration of SLV models
yields a non-linear system of ODEs. Numerical time stepping is performed by the
Hundsdorfer-Verwer ADI scheme to increase the computational efficiency. The
non-linearity in the system of ODEs is handled by introducing an inner
iteration. Ample numerical experiments are presented that illustrate the
effectiveness of the calibration procedure.

gravitational waves in the data of the first run of the Advanced LIGO detectors
between September 2015 and January 2016. The search algorithms use minimal
assumptions on the signal morphology, so they are sensitive to a wide range of
sources emitting gravitational waves. The analyses target transient signals
with duration ranging from milliseconds to seconds over the frequency band of
32 to 4096 Hz. The first observed gravitational-wave event, GW150914, has been
detected with high confidence in this search; other known gravitational-wave
events fall below the search's sensitivity. Besides GW150914, all of the search
results are consistent with the expected rate of accidental noise coincidences.
Finally, we estimate rate-density limits for a broad range of non-BBH transient
gravitational-wave sources as a function of their gravitational radiation
emission energy and their characteristic frequency. These rate-density
upper-limits are stricter than those previously published by an
order-of-magnitude.

show how to construct exact solutions corresponding to the formation of either
a black hole or a conical singularity from the collision of an arbitrary number
of massive particles that fall in radially and collide at the origin of AdS. No
restrictions on the masses or the angular and radial positions from where the
particles are released, are imposed. We also consider the limit of an infinite
number of particles, obtaining novel timelike thin shell spacetimes. These thin
shells have an arbitrary mass distribution as well as a non-trivial embedding
where the radial location of the shell depends on the angular coordinate, and
we analyze these shells using the junction formalism of general relativity. We
also consider the massless limit and find consistency with earlier results, as
well as comment on the stress-energy tensor modes of the dual CFT.

potential systems they admit the maximum number of symmetry operators but their
symmetry algebras don't close under commutation and not enough is known about
their structure to give a complete classification. Some examples are known for
which the 3-parameter system can be extended to a 4th order superintegrable
system with a 4-parameter potential and 6 linearly independent symmetry
generators. In this paper we use B\^ocher contractions of the conformal Lie
algebra $so(5,C)$ to itself to generate a large family of 3-parameter systems
with 4th order extensions, on a variety of manifolds, and all from B\^ocher
contractions of a single ""generic"" system on the 3-sphere. We give a
contraction scheme relating these systems. The results have myriad applications

N=2 truncations of type IIB supergravity compactified on the Sasaki-Einstein

coming from the nontrivial second and third cohomology forms on $T^{1,1}$.
These give rise to N=2 supergravity coupled to two vector- and two
hypermultiplets (Betti-vector truncation) or one vector- and three
hypermultiplets (Betti-hyper truncation), respectively. We find that both
truncations admit AdS$_5$ backgrounds with the gauge group always being broken
but containing at least an $U(1)_R$ factor. Moreover, in both cases we show
that the moduli space of AdS vacua is nontrivial and of maximal dimension.
Finally, we explicitly compute the metrics on these moduli spaces.

example, offers important information for our understanding of jet formation
and radio-loudness. Radio galaxies, on the other hand, have become particularly
interesting at high (HE) and very high (VHE) gamma-ray energies. With their
jets not directly pointing towards us (i.e. misaligned), they offer a unique
tool to probe into the nature of the fundamental (and often hidden) physical
processes in AGN. This review highlights and discusses some of the
observational and theoretical progress achieved in the gamma-ray regime during
recent years, including the evidence for unexpected spectral hardening in
Centaurus A and extreme short-term variability as seen in IC 310 and M87.

achieving a physical averaging of independent, mutually incoherent speckle

conservation laws by semi-linear system with stiff source term also called as

nonlinearity in the convection term is pushed towards the source term on right
hand side which can be handled with ease. Six symmetric discrete velocity
models are introduced in two dimensions which symmetrically spread foot of the
characteristics in all four quadrants thereby taking information symmetrically
from all directions. Proposed scheme gives exact diffusion vectors which are
very simple. Moreover, the formulation is easily extendable from scalar to
vector conservation laws. Various test cases are solved for Burgers equation
(with convex and non-convex flux functions), Euler equations and shallow water
equations in one and two dimensions which demonstrate the robustness and
accuracy of the proposed scheme. New test cases are proposed for Burgers
equation, Euler and shallow water equations. Exact solution is given for
two-dimensional Burgers test case which involves normal discontinuity and
series of oblique discontinuities. Error analysis of the proposed scheme shows
optimal convergence rate. Moreover, spectral stability analysis gives implicit
expression of critical time step.

proposed to analyze the M/G/1 queue with the vacation time that is governed by
the arrival process and the parameter {\tau} and N of the BTR strategy. Our key
idea is to establish the connection between the vacation time and the arrival
process to account for their dependency. We first derive the distribution of
the number of arrivals during a vacation time based on an event tree of the BTR
strategy, from which we obtain the mean vacation time and the power efficiency.
Next, from the condition on the number of arrivals at the end of a vacation
period, we derive a generalized P-K formula of the mean delay for EEE systems,
and prove that the classical P-K formula of the vacation model is only a
special case when the vacation time is independent of the arrival process. Our
analysis demonstrates that the {\tau} policy and N policy of the BTR strategy
are compensating each other. The {\tau} policy ensures the frame delay is
bounded when the traffic load is light, while the N policy ensures the queue
length at the end of vacation is bounded when the traffic load is heavy. These
results, in turn, provide the rules to select appropriate {\tau} and N. Our
analytical results are confirmed by simulations.
