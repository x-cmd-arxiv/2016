cosmological principle, is a central assumption in the standard cosmological
model. The case is testable though, thus no longer needs to be a principle.
Here we perform a test for spatial homogeneity using the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) sample by counting galaxies within a
specified volume with the radius scale varying up to 300 Mpc/h. We directly
confront the large-scale structure data with the definition of spatial
homogeneity by comparing the averages and dispersions of galaxy number counts
with allowed ranges of the random distribution with homogeneity. The LRG sample
shows significantly larger dispersions of number counts than the random
catalogues up to 300 Mpc/h scale, and even the average is located far outside
the range allowed in the random distribution; the deviations are statistically
impossible to be realized in the random distribution. This implies that the
cosmological principle does not hold even at such large scales. The same
analysis of mock galaxies derived from the N-body simulation, however, suggests
that the LRG sample is consistent with the current paradigm of cosmology, thus
the simulation is also not homogeneous in that scale. We conclude that the
cosmological principle is not in the observed sky and nor is demanded to be
there by the standard cosmological world model. This reveals the nature of the
cosmological principle adopted in the modern cosmology paradigm, and opens new
field of research in theoretical cosmology.

hamper the desired application. In this paper, we design an algorithm to
address all three optimization goals simultaneously. The user specifies desired
bounds on approximation error {\delta}, minimal interior angle {\theta} and
maximum mesh complexity N (number of vertices). Since such a desired mesh might
not even exist, our optimization framework treats only the approximation error
bound {\delta} as a hard constraint and the other two criteria as optimization
goals. More specifically, we iteratively perform carefully prioritized local
operators, whenever they do not violate the approximation error bound and
improve the mesh otherwise. In this way our optimization framework greedily
searches for the coarsest mesh with minimal interior angle above {\theta} and
approximation error bounded by {\delta}. Fast runtime is enabled by a local
approximation error estimation, while implicit feature preservation is obtained
by specifically designed vertex relocation operators. Experiments show that our
approach delivers high-quality meshes with implicitly preserved features and
better balances between geometric fidelity, mesh complexity and element quality

from the viewpoint of its Lagrangian. For instance, powerful constraints on
scattering amplitudes are imposed by the dual conformal symmetry of planar 4d

we investigate the consequences of dual conformal symmetry in six dimensions,
which may provide useful insight into the worldvolume theory of M5-branes (if
it enjoys such a symmetry). We find that 6d dual conformal symmetry uniquely
fixes the integrand of the one-loop 4-point amplitude, and its structure
suggests a Lagrangian with more than two derivatives. On integrating out the
loop momentum in $6-2 \epsilon$ dimensions, the result is very similar to the
corresponding amplitude of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. We confirm
this result holographically by generalizing the Alday-Maldacena solution for a
minimal area string in Anti-de Sitter space to a minimal volume M2-brane ending
on pillow-shaped Wilson surface in the boundary whose seams correspond to a
null-polygonal Wilson loop. This involves careful treatment of a prefactor

Although several laboratory studied thermally induced segregation, a satisfying

pores inside water ice is the key to quantify segregation. We combined
Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) and Reflection Absorption InfraRed
Spectroscopy (RAIRS) to study how CO$_2$ molecules interact on a non-porous
amorphous solid water (np-ASW) surface. We found that CO$_2$ diffuses
significantly on a np-ASW surface above 65~K and clusters are formed at well
below one monolayer. A simple rate equation simulation finds that the diffusion
energy barrier of CO$_2$ on np-ASW is 2150$\pm$50 K, assuming a diffusion
pre-exponential factor of 10$^{12}$ s$^{-1}$. This energy should also apply to
the diffusion of CO$_2$ on wall of pores. The binding energy of CO$_2$ from
CO$_2$ clusters and CO$_2$ from H$_2$O ice have been found to be $2415\pm20$
and $2250\pm20$~K, respectively, assuming the same prefactor for desorption.
CO$_2$-CO$_2$ interaction is stronger than CO$_2$-H$_2$O interaction, in
agreement with the experimental finding that CO$_2$ does not wet np-ASW
surface. For comparison, we carried out similar experiments with CO on np-ASW,
and found that the CO-CO interaction is always weaker than CO-H$_2$O. As a
result, CO wets np-ASW surface. This study should be of help to uncover the
thermal history of CO$_2$ on the icy mantles of dust grains.

PAHs are positively detected by their 3.3, 6.2, 7.7 8.6, 11.3 & 12.7 $\mu$m IR

empirical link between the 2175 \AA\ UV extinction, and the PAH IR emission

have both 2175 \AA\ absorption and PAH IR emission. We find significant shifts
of the central wavelength of the UV absorption feature, up to 2350 \AA, but
predominantly in stars that also have IR PAH emission. These UV shifts depend
on stellar temperature in a fashion that is similar to the shifts of the 6.2

red-shifted as the stellar temperature decreases, but only below $\sim 15$ kK.
Above 15 kK both UV and IR features retain their nominal values. Moreover, we
find a suggestive correlation between the UV and IR shifts. We hypothesize that
these similar dependences of both the UV and IR features on stellar temperature
hint to a common origin of the two in PAH molecules and may establish the
missing link between the UV and IR observations. We further suggest that the
shifts depend on molecular size, and that the critical temperature of $\sim 15$
kK above which no shifts are observed is related to the onset of UV driven
hot-star winds and their associated shocks.

processing. They have the potential to join the precise quantum operations of
trapped ions and the strong, long-range interactions between Rydberg atoms.
Technically, the ion trap will need to stay active while exciting the ions into
the Rydberg state, else the strong Coulomb repulsion will quickly push the ions
apart. Thus, a thorough understanding of the trap effects on Rydberg ions is
essential for future applications. Here we report the observation of two
fundamental trap effects. First, we investigate the interaction of the Rydberg
electron with the quadrupolar electric trapping field. This effect leads to
Floquet sidebands in the spectroscopy of Rydberg D-states whereas Rydberg
S-states are unaffected due to their symmetry. Second, we report on the
modified trapping potential in the Rydberg state compared to the ground state
which results from the strong polarizability of the Rydberg ion. We observe the
resultant energy shifts as a line broadening which can be suppressed by cooling
the ion to the motional ground state in the directions orthogonal to the
excitation laser.

objective of Piecewise-Linear Convolutional Neural Networks (PL-CNNs), a large
class of convolutional neural networks. Specifically, PL-CNNs employ piecewise
linear non-linearities such as the commonly used ReLU and max-pool, and an SVM
classifier as the final layer. The key observation of our approach is that the
problem corresponding to the parameter estimation of a layer can be formulated
as a difference-of-convex (DC) program, which happens to be a latent structured
SVM. We optimize the DC program using the concave-convex procedure, which
requires us to iteratively solve a structured SVM problem. This allows to
design an optimization algorithm with an optimal learning rate that does not
require any tuning. Using the MNIST, CIFAR and ImageNet data sets, we show that
our approach always improves over the state of the art variants of
backpropagation and scales to large data and large network settings.

along the line of sight, we attempt to constrain the distance to the SNR.
Results: Prominent line features reveal the presence of ejecta. Abundance
ratios of Mg, Si, S, Ar, and Ca strongly suggest that the progenitor of SNR
G15.9+0.2 was a massive star with a main sequence mass likely in the range
20-25 $M_{\odot}$, strengthening the physical association with a candidate
central compact object detected with Chandra. Using EPIC's collective power, Fe
K line emission from SNR G15.9+0.2 is detected for the first time. We measure
the line properties and find evidence for spatial variations. We discuss how
the source fits within the sample of SNRs with detected Fe K emission and find
that it is the core-collapse SNR with the lowest Fe K centroid energy. We also
present some caveats regarding the use of Fe K line centroid energy as a typing
tool for SNRs. Only a lower limit of 5 kpc is placed on the distance to SNR

stars, both young and old. A promising scenario to explain the presence of this
short-lived dust is that these analogues to the Zodiacal cloud (or exozodis)
are refilled in situ through cometary activity and sublimation. As the
reservoir of comets is not expected to be replenished, the presence of these
exozodis in old systems has yet to be adequately explained.
  It was recently suggested that mean-motion resonances (MMR) with exterior
planets on moderately eccentric ($\mathrm{e_p}\gtrsim 0.1$) orbits could
scatter planetesimals on to cometary orbits with delays of the order of several
100 Myr. Theoretically, this mechanism is also expected to sustain continuous
production of active comets once it has started, potentially over
Gyr-timescales.
  We aim here to investigate the ability of this mechanism to generate
scattering on to cometary orbits compatible with the production of an exozodi
on long timescales. We combine analytical predictions and complementary
numerical N-body simulations to study its characteristics.
  We show, using order of magnitude estimates, that via this mechanism, low
mass discs comparable to the Kuiper Belt could sustain comet scattering at
rates compatible with the presence of the exozodis which are detected around
Solar-type stars, and on Gyr timescales. We also find that the levels of dust
detected around Vega could be sustained via our proposed mechanism if an
eccentric Jupiter-like planet were present exterior to the system's cold debris
disc.

enlarged to combine the quantum treatment of the external variables with the
internal-state characterization; additionally, atomic-interaction effects are
considered. The emergence of the basic model is analytically traced. Namely, by
using a sequence of unitary transformations and a subsequent reduction to the
spin space, the SOC Hamiltonian, with the gravitational potential incorporated,
is exactly converted into the primary LZ scenario. Moreover, the transitions
induced by harmonic acceleration are approximately cast into the framework of
the basic LZ model through a complete analytical procedure. We evaluate how the

attributes may be acquired naturally by human players, teaching them to a
computer program is a far more challenging task. In recent years, extensive
research was carried out in the field of reinforcement learning and numerous

playing video games. As a result, the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)
(Bellemare et al., 2013) has become a commonly used benchmark environment
allowing algorithms to train on various Atari 2600 games. In many games the
state-of-the-art algorithms outperform humans. In this paper we introduce a new
learning environment, the Retro Learning Environment --- RLE, that can run
games on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Sega Genesis and
several other gaming consoles. The environment is expandable, allowing for more
video games and consoles to be easily added to the environment, while
maintaining the same interface as ALE. Moreover, RLE is compatible with Python
and Torch. SNES games pose a significant challenge to current algorithms due to
their higher level of complexity and versatility.

particles by means of direct numerical simulations using a direct-forcing
immersed boundary method to account for the dispersed phase. A volume of fluid
approach is employed to solve the temperature field inside and outside of the
particles.
  We focus on the variation of the heat transfer with the particle Reynolds
number, total volume fraction (number of particles) and the ratio between the
particle and fluid thermal diffusivity, quantified in terms of an effective
suspension diffusivity. We show that, when inertia at the particle scale is
negligible, the heat transfer increases with respect to the unladen case
following an empirical correlation recently proposed. In addition, an average
composite diffusivity can be used to predict the effective diffusivity of the
suspension the inertialess regime when varying the molecular diffusion in the
two phases. At finite particle inertia, however, the heat transfer increase is
significantly larger, saturating at higher volume fractions. By phase-ensemble
averaging we identify the different mechanisms contributing to the total heat
transfer and show that the increase of the effective conductivity observed at
finite inertia is due to the increase of the transport associated to fluid and
particle velocity. We also show that the heat conduction in the solid phase
reduces when increasing the particle Reynolds number and so that particles of
low thermal diffusivity weakly alter the total heat flux in the suspension at
finite particle Reynolds numbers. On the other hand, a higher particle thermal
diffusivity significantly increase the total heat transfer.

the non-twisting null geodesic congruence and the tetrad which is parallelly

easily established in general, its explicit form can be very difficult to find

nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) has been shown as a robust and versatile
method for characterizing mechanical properties of nanocantilevers. This paper
aims to investigate the surface effects, specifically residual surface stress
and surface elasticity, on the EPI of micro and nano-scale cantilevers as well
as double clamped beams. Since the cantilever has one end free, it has no
residual stress, thus the strain-independent component of the surface stress or
intrinsic surface stress has no influence on the EPI, as long as it has small
deformation. The strain-dependent component of the surface stress or surface
elasticity changes the bending stiffness of the cantilever and, consequently,
induces shifts in the EPI. For double clamped beams, the effective residual
surface stress comes into play and modifies the effective residual stress of
the beam. The nonlinear electromechanical coupled equations, which take into
account the surface effects are solved numerically. The theoretical results
presented in this paper indicate that the EPI is very sensitive to the surface
effects, especially when a double clamped beam is employed. The results show
that the influence of surface effects on the EPI of cantilevers become more
profound when the thickness is below 50 nm, while the influence on double
clamped beams is significant even at sub-micron scale. The present study can
provide helpful insights for the design and characterization of NEMS switches.
Moreover, the results can be used to provide the proof of concepts of a new
surface stress sensing method using EPI in nanomechanical sensor systems.

in twisted coronal loops can be a viable scenario for confined solar flares.
Detailed investigation of this phenomenon requires reliable methods for
observational detection of magnetic twist in solar flares, which may not be
possible solely through extreme UV and soft X-ray thermal emission.
Polarisation of microwave emission in flaring loops can be used as one of the
detection criteria. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of
magnetic twist in flaring coronal loops on the polarisation of gyro-synchrotron
microwave (GSMW) emission, and determine whether it could provide a means for
magnetic twist detection. We use time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic and
test-particle models developed using LARE3D and GCA codes to investigate
twisted coronal loops relaxing following the kink-instability. Synthetic GSMW
emission maps (I and V Stokes components) are calculated using GX simulator. It
is found that flaring twisted coronal loops produce GSMW radiation with a
gradient of circular polarisation across the loop. However, these patterns may
be visible only for a relatively short period of time due to fast magnetic
reconfiguration after the instability. Their visibility also depends on the
orientation and position of the loop on solar disk. Typically, it would be
difficult to see these characteristic polarisation pattern in a twisted loop
seen from the top (close to the centre of the solar disk), but easier in a
twisted loop seen from the side (i.e. observed very close to the limb).

chain, where the walk occurs on the edges of the bipartite double cover of the

absorbing vertices. Recently, Santos proposed two alternative search algorithms
that instead utilize the sign-flip oracle in Grover's algorithm rather than
absorbing vertices. In this paper, we show that these two algorithms are
exactly equivalent to two algorithms involving coined quantum walks, which are
walks on the vertices of the original graph with an internal degree of freedom.
The first scheme is equivalent to a coined quantum walk with one walk-step per
query of Grover's oracle, and the second is equivalent to a coined quantum walk
with two walk-steps per query of Grover's oracle. These equivalences lie
outside the previously known equivalence of Szegedy's quantum walk with
absorbing vertices and the coined quantum walk with the negative identity
operator as the coin for marked vertices, whose precise relationships we also
investigate.

wide variety of simulated domains. However, a major obstacle facing deep RL in
the real world is their high sample complexity. Batch policy gradient methods
offer stable learning, but at the cost of high variance, which often requires
large batches. TD-style methods, such as off-policy actor-critic and
Q-learning, are more sample-efficient but biased, and often require costly
hyperparameter sweeps to stabilize. In this work, we aim to develop methods
that combine the stability of policy gradients with the efficiency of
off-policy RL. We present Q-Prop, a policy gradient method that uses a Taylor
expansion of the off-policy critic as a control variate. Q-Prop is both sample
efficient and stable, and effectively combines the benefits of on-policy and
off-policy methods. We analyze the connection between Q-Prop and existing
model-free algorithms, and use control variate theory to derive two variants of
Q-Prop with conservative and aggressive adaptation. We show that conservative
Q-Prop provides substantial gains in sample efficiency over trust region policy

stability over deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), the state-of-the-art

stars, corresponding to a frequency of 4.1 $\%$ of the entire sample of solar

previous studies. The estimation of the dust properties shows that the sources
with infrared excesses possess circumstellar material with temperatures that,
within the uncertainties, are similar to that of the material found in the
asteroid belt in our solar system. No photospheric flux excess was identified
at the W1 (3.4 $\mu$m) and W2 (4.6 $\mu$m) \textit{WISE} bands, indicating

generated. Interestingly, among the sixty solar twin stars analyzed in this

relations lead to modified plasma frequencies and reflectivities, as well as to
negative group velocities. It is shown that the zero-point energy of the system
implies a repulsive force between two parallel plates, which vanishes when the

  Technology, 2017",,,"cs.CE math.NA stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fabrication process variations are a major source of yield degradation in the
nano-scale design of integrated circuits (IC), microelectromechanical systems
(MEMS) and photonic circuits. Stochastic spectral methods are a promising
technique to quantify the uncertainties caused by process variations. Despite
their superior efficiency over Monte Carlo for many design cases, these
algorithms suffer from the curse of dimensionality; i.e., their computational
cost grows very fast as the number of random parameters increases. In order to
solve this challenging problem, this paper presents a high-dimensional
uncertainty quantification algorithm from a big-data perspective. Specifically,
we show that the huge number of (e.g., $1.5 \times 10^{27}$) simulation samples
in standard stochastic collocation can be reduced to a very small one (e.g.,
$500$) by exploiting some hidden structures of a high-dimensional data array.
This idea is formulated as a tensor recovery problem with sparse and low-rank
constraints; and it is solved with an alternating minimization approach.
Numerical results show that our approach can simulate efficiently some ICs, as
well as MEMS and photonic problems with over 50 independent random parameters,
whereas the traditional algorithm can only handle several random parameters.

generalized to also include $T$-privacy constraints). Combined with previous

predominantly transparent to both CRs and gamma-rays, so GeV emission is a
unique probe of the total gas column density. The gamma-ray emissivity of a
cloud of known column density is then a measure of the impinging CR population
and may be used to map the kpc-scale CR distribution in the Galaxy. To this
end, we test a number of commonly used column density tracers to evaluate their
effectiveness in modeling the GeV emission from the relatively quiescent,
nearby $\rho$ Ophiuchi molecular cloud. We confirm that both \hi\ and an
appropriate H$_2$ tracer are required to reproduce the total gas column
densities probed by diffuse gamma-ray emisison. We find that the optical depth
at 353 GHz $\tau_{353}$ from Planck reproduces the gamma-ray data best overall

infrared stellar extinction also performs very well, with smaller spatial
residuals in the densest parts of the cloud.

together from the entanglement structure of an underlying microscopic theory.
These ideas are best understood in Anti-de Sitter space, where they rely on the
area law for entanglement entropy. The extension to de Sitter space requires
taking into account the entropy and temperature associated with the
cosmological horizon. Using insights from string theory, black hole physics and
quantum information theory we argue that the positive dark energy leads to a
thermal volume law contribution to the entropy that overtakes the area law
precisely at the cosmological horizon. Due to the competition between area and
volume law entanglement the microscopic de Sitter states do not thermalise at
sub-Hubble scales: they exhibit memory effects in the form of an entropy
displacement caused by matter. The emergent laws of gravity contain an
additional `dark' gravitational force describing the `elastic' response due to
the entropy displacement. We derive an estimate of the strength of this extra
force in terms of the baryonic mass, Newton's constant and the Hubble
acceleration scale a_0 =cH_0, and provide evidence for the fact that this
additional `dark gravity~force' explains the observed phenomena in galaxies and
clusters currently attributed to dark matter.

Messages carried by Ca are local, rapid, and powerful enough to be delivered
over the thermal noise. A higher signal to noise ratio is achieved by a
cooperative action of Ca release channels such as IP3 receptors or ryanodine
receptors arranged in clusters or release units containing a few to several
hundred release channels. The release channels synchronize their openings via
Ca-induced-Ca-release, generating high-amplitude local Ca signals known as
puffs in neurons or sparks in muscle cells. Despite the high release amplitude
and positive feedback nature of the activation, Ca signals are strictly
confined in time and space by an unexplained termination mechanism. Here we
show that the collective transition of release channels from an open to a
closed state is identical to the phase transition associated with the reversal
of magnetic field in an Ising ferromagnet. We demonstrate this mechanism using
numerical model simulations of Ca sparks over a wide range of cluster sizes
from 25 to 169 release channels. While prior studies suggested contributions of
stochastic attrition and Ca store depletion, our new simple quantitative
criterion closely predicts the depletion level required for spark termination
for each cluster size. We further formulate exact requirements for a cluster of
release channels to follow the Ising model in any cell type. Thus we describe
deterministically the behaviour of a system on a coarser scale (release unit)
which is random on a finer scale (release channels), bridging the gap between
scales. Our results provide the first exact mapping of a nanoscale biological
signalling model to an interacting particle system in statistical physics,
making the extensive mathematical apparatus available to quantitative biology.

emission signatures of HI, HeI, and higher ionisation species, in particular
FeII. The spectral features are divided between broad red-shifted and narrow
stationary varieties, the latter being emitted in the outer regions. Continuum
and line variability at short time scale is high and we find Baldwin
effect-like anti-correlations between the full-widths at half-maximum and
equivalent widths of the broad lines with their local continua. The Balmer
decrement H{\alpha}/H{\beta} is also abnormally large at $4.61\pm0.62$. We
argue that these properties hint at the broad lines being optically thick and
arising within a circumbinary component in which shocks between faster
optically thick and slower optically thin regions may occur. We associate it to
a nova-like nebula formed by the cooling remnant of strong accretion disc winds
that turned off when the mass-accretion rate dropped following the last major
flare. The FeII lines likely arise from the overlap region between this nebula
and the companion star winds, whereas we favour the shocks within the nebula as
responsible for the optical continuum via self-absorbed optically thin
bremsstrahlung. The presence of a near-infrared excess also points towards the
contribution of a strongly variable compact jet or a dusty component.

producing nuclei up to $A \sim 130$ (i.e. the weak r-process), while explosion
models with stronger magnetic fields reproduce a solar-like r-process pattern.
More commonly seen abundance patterns in our models are in between the weak and
regular r-process, producing lighter and intermediate mass nuclei. These {\it
intermediate r-processes} exhibit a variety of abundance distributions,
compatible with several abundance patterns in r-process-enhanced metal-poor
stars. The amount of Eu ejecta $\sim 10^{-5} M_\odot$ in magnetically-driven
jets agrees with predicted values in the chemical evolution of early galaxies.

matter halos, all with masses of $M_{\rm halo} \approx 10^{10}\,{\rm M}_\odot$
at $z=0$, in order to understand the relationship between halo assembly, galaxy
formation, and feedback's effects on the central density structure in dwarf
galaxies. These simulations are part of the Feedback in Realistic Environments
(FIRE) project and are performed at extremely high resolution. The resultant
galaxies have stellar masses that are consistent with rough abundance matching
estimates, coinciding with the faintest galaxies that can be seen beyond the
virial radius of the Milky Way ($M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot\approx 10^5-10^7$). This
non-negligible spread in stellar mass at $z=0$ in halos within a narrow range
of virial masses is strongly correlated with central halo density or maximum
circular velocity $V_{\rm max}$. Much of this dependence of $M_\star$ on a
second parameter (beyond $M_{\rm halo}$) is a direct consequence of the $M_{\rm
halo}\sim10^{10}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ mass scale coinciding with the threshold for
strong reionization suppression: the densest, earliest-forming halos remain
above the UV-suppression scale throughout their histories while late-forming
systems fall below the UV-suppression scale over longer periods and form fewer
stars as a result. In fact, the latest-forming, lowest-concentration halo in
our suite fails to form any stars. Halos that form galaxies with
$M_\star\gtrsim2\times10^{6}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ have reduced central densities
relative to dark-matter-only simulations, and the radial extent of the density
modifications is well-approximated by the galaxy half-mass radius $r_{1/2}$.
This apparent stellar mass threshold of $M_\star \approx 2\times 10^{6} \approx
2\times 10^{-4} \,M_{\rm halo}$ is broadly consistent with previous work and
provides a testable prediction of FIRE feedback models in LCDM.

frame. Five Orphan Stream stars are identified in one of the four fields based
on combined color-magnitude and PM information. The average PM is consistent
with the existing model of the Orphan stream by Newberg et al. In addition to
the Orphan stream stars, we detect stars that likely belong to other stellar
streams. To identify which stellar streams these stars belong to, we examine
the 2-d bulk motion of each group of stars on the sky by subtracting the PM
contribution of the solar motion (which is a function of position on the sky
and distance) from the observed PMs, and comparing the vector of net motion
with the spatial extent of known stellar streams. By doing this, we identify
candidate stars in the Sagittarius and Lethe streams, and a newly-found stellar
stream at a distance of ~17 kpc, which we tentatively name the ""Parallel

Here we specifically focus on the interplay between classical and quantum

overdense filaments that undergo gravitational collapse and form planetesimals.
However, it remains unclear how the initial mass function of these
planetesimals depends on the box dimensions of numerical simulations. To
resolve this, we perform simulations of planetesimal formation with the largest
box dimensions to date, allowing planetesimals to form simultaneously in
multiple filaments that can only emerge within such large simulation boxes. In
our simulations, planetesimals with sizes between 80 km and several hundred
kilometers form. We find that a power law with a rather shallow exponential
cutoff at the high-mass end represents the cumulative birth mass function
better than an integrated power law. The steepness of the exponential cutoff is
largely independent of box dimensions and resolution, while the exponent of the
power law is not constrained at the resolutions we employ. Moreover, we find
that the characteristic mass scale of the exponential cutoff correlates with
the mass budget in each filament. Together with previous studies of
high-resolution simulations with small box domains, our results therefore imply
that the cumulative birth mass function of planetesimals is consistent with an
exponentially tapered power law with a power-law exponent of approximately -1.6
and a steepness of the exponential cutoff in the range of 0.3-0.4.

depending on both black hole and hot gas mass, and hence indirectly on stellar
mass. In addition, satellite galaxies of any mass can be quenched by
ram-pressure or tidal stripping of gas and through the suppression of gaseous
infall. This combination of processes produces quenching efficiencies which
depend on stellar mass, host halo mass, environment density, distance to group
centre and group central galaxy properties in ways which agree qualitatively
with observation. Some discrepancies remain in dense regions and close to group
centres, where quenching still seems too efficient. In addition, although the
mean stellar age of massive galaxies agrees with observation, the assumed AGN
feedback model allows too much ongoing star formation at late times. The fact
that both AGN feedback and environmental effects are stronger in higher density

is produced by direct decay of heavy particles at the end of reheating. The
non-thermal WIMP becomes important when the reheating temperature is well below
the freeze-out temperature. Usually, two limiting cases have been considered.
One is that the produced high energetic dark matter particles are quickly
thermalized due to the elastic scattering with background radiations. The
corresponding relic abundance is determined by the thermally averaged
annihilation cross-section at the reheating temperature. The other one is that
the initial abundance is too small for the dark matter to annihilate so that
the final relic is determined by the initial amount itself. We study the
regions between these two limits, and show that the relic density depends not
only on the annihilation rate, but also on the elastic scattering rate.
Especially, the relic abundance of the p-wave annihilating dark matter
crucially relies on the elastic scattering rate because the annihilation
cross-section is sensitive to the dark matter velocity. We categorize the
parameter space into several regions where each region has distinctive
mechanism for determining the relic abundance of the dark matter at the present
Universe. The consequence on the (in)direct detection is also studied.

formation rate density and cold gas mass density histories, but the CMB optical
depth is consistent with that estimate. We make several predictions, testable

approximation and replica techniques, separates the non-ergodic phase at small
transverse field from an ergodic phase at large transverse field. The
non-ergodic phase is also bounded from above in temperature, by a transition in
configuration-space statistics reminiscent of the clustering transition in
spin-glass theory. We show that the non-ergodic eigenstates are organized in
clusters which exhibit distinct magnetization patterns, as characterized by an
eigenstate variant of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter.

identical units. If the units are different from each other, their dynamics
cannot become identical; yet, after transients, there may emerge a functional
relationship between them -- a phenomenon termed ""generalized synchronization.""
Here, we show that the concept of transient uncoupling, recently introduced for
synchronizing identical units, also supports generalized synchronization among
nonidentical chaotic units. Generalized synchronization can be achieved by
transient uncoupling even when it is impossible by regular coupling. We
furthermore demonstrate that transient uncoupling stabilizes synchronization in
the presence of common noise. Transient uncoupling works best if the units stay
uncoupled whenever the driven orbit visits regions that are locally diverging
in its phase space. Thus, to select a favorable uncoupling region, we propose
an intuitive method that measures the local divergence at the phase points of
the driven unit's trajectory by linearizing the flow and subsequently
suppresses the divergence by uncoupling.

Proliferation of personalized data (e.g., genetic and imaging data) provides
opportunities for deep tailoring as well as new challenges for statistical

Augmented Multistage Outcome-Weighted Learning (AMOL) to integrate
outcome-weighted learning and Q-learning to identify optimal DTRs from the
Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomization Trials (SMARTs). We generalize
outcome weighted learning (O-learning; Zhao et al.~2012) to allow for negative

SMART studies, we introduce doubly robust augmentation to machine learning
based O-learning to improve efficiency by drawing information from regression
model-based Q-learning at each stage. The proposed AMOL remains valid even if
the Q-learning model is misspecified. We establish the theoretical properties
of AMOL, including the consistency of the estimated rules and the rates of
convergence to the optimal value function. The comparative advantage of AMOL
over existing methods is demonstrated in extensive simulation studies and

assume that the available training data is a reasonably reliable reflection of

presence of large amounts of biased or malicious data. In this work we consider
two frameworks in which to study estimation, learning, and optimization in the
presence of significant fractions of arbitrary data.
  The first framework, list-decodable learning, asks whether it is possible to
return a list of answers, with the guarantee that at least one of them is
accurate. For example, given a dataset of $n$ points for which an unknown
subset of $\alpha n$ points are drawn from a distribution of interest, and no
assumptions are made about the remaining $(1-\alpha)n$ points, is it possible
to return a list of $\operatorname{poly}(1/\alpha)$ answers, one of which is
correct? The second framework, which we term the semi-verified learning model,
considers the extent to which a small dataset of trusted data (drawn from the
distribution in question) can be leveraged to enable the accurate extraction of
information from a much larger but untrusted dataset (of which only an
$\alpha$-fraction is drawn from the distribution).
  We show strong positive results in both settings, and provide an algorithm
for robust learning in a very general stochastic optimization setting. This
general result has immediate implications for robust estimation in a number of
settings, including for robustly estimating the mean of distributions with
bounded second moments, robustly learning mixtures of such distributions, and
robustly finding planted partitions in random graphs in which significant
portions of the graph have been perturbed by an adversary.

component of the undergraduate curriculum, particularly with respect to
developing students' interest in, and understanding of, experimental physics.
There are a number of possible learning goals for these courses including
reinforcing physics concepts, developing laboratory skills, and promoting
expert-like beliefs about the nature of experimental physics. However, there is
little consensus among instructors and researchers interested in the laboratory
learning environment as to relative importance of these various learning goals.
Here, we contribute data to this debate through the analysis of students'
responses to the laboratory-focused assessment known as the Colorado Learning
Attitudes about Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS). Using a
large, national data set of students' responses, we compare students' E-CLASS
performance in classes in which the instructor self-reported focusing on
developing skills, reinforcing concepts, or both. As the classification of
courses was based on instructor self-report, we also provide additional
description of these course with respect to how often students engage in
particular activities in the lab. We find that courses that focus specifically
on developing lab skills have more expert-like postinstruction E-CLASS
responses than courses that focus either on reinforcing physics concepts or on
both goals. Within first-year courses, this effect is larger for women.
Moreover, these findings hold when controlling for the variance in
postinstruction scores that is associated with preinstruction E-CLASS score,
student major, and student gender.

the problem as a two player game in which the sensor (defender) chooses an
optimal fusion strategy using both the non-trusted output from the central
computer and locally stored trusted data. The attacker seeks to compromise the
computation by influencing the fused value through malicious manipulation of
the data stored on the central node. We first characterize all Nash equilibria
of this game, which turn out to be dependent on parameters known to both
players. Next we adopt an Iterated Best Response (IBR) scheme in which, at each
iteration, the central computer reveals its output to the sensor, who then
computes its best response based on a linear combination of its private local
estimate and the untrusted third-party output. We characterize necessary and
sufficient conditions for convergence of the IBR along with numerical results
which show that the convergence conditions are relatively tight.

drawbacks that have appeared in recent work using the formula to generate

laws and does not always yield all non-trivial conservation laws unless the
symmetry action on the set of these conservation laws is transitive. It is
emphasized that all local conservation laws for any given system of

associations and coordinated beamformers for all MSs. With target
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios at the MSs, the design objective is to
minimize either the weighted sum transmit power or the per-BS transmit power
margin. Since the original optimization problems contain binary variables
indicating the BS associations, finding their optimal solutions is a
challenging task. To circumvent this difficulty, we first relax the original
problems into new optimization problems by expanding their constraint sets.
Based on the nonconvex quadratic constrained quadratic programming framework,
we show that these relaxed problems can be solved optimally. Interestingly,
with the first design objective, the obtained solution from the relaxed problem
is also optimal to the original problem. With the second design objective, a
suboptimal solution to the original problem is then proposed, based on the
obtained solution from the relaxed problem. Simulation results show that the
resulting jointly optimal BS association and beamforming design significantly

graph induced on the edges of any color class is locally irregular. It is
conjectured that $3$ colors suffice for a locally irregular edge-coloring.
Recently, Bensmail et al. (Bensmail, Merker, Thomassen: Decomposing graphs into
a constant number of locally irregular subgraphs, {\em European J. Combin.},
60:124--134, 2017) settled the first constant upper bound for the problem to
$328$ colors. In this paper, using a combination of existing results, we
present an improvement of the bounds for bipartite graphs and general graphs,
setting the best upper bounds to $7$ and $220$, respectively. In addition, we
also prove that $4$ colors suffice for locally irregular edge-coloring of any
subcubic graph.

position of a robot that is tracking a possibly moving target. The robot is
capable of obtaining noisy measurements of the target's position. The key idea
in active target tracking is to choose control laws that drive the robot to
measurement locations that will reduce the uncertainty in the target's
position. The challenge is that measurement uncertainty often is a function of
the (unknown) relative positions of the target and the robot. Consequently, a
closed-loop control policy is desired which can map the current estimate of the
target's position to an optimal control law for the robot.
  Our main contribution is to devise a closed-loop control policy for target
tracking that plans for a sequence of control actions, instead of acting
greedily. We consider scenarios where the noise in measurement is a function of
the state of the target. We seek to minimize the maximum uncertainty (trace of
the posterior covariance matrix) over all possible measurements. We exploit the
structural properties of a Kalman Filter to build a policy tree that is orders
of magnitude smaller than naive enumeration while still preserving optimality
guarantees. We show how to obtain even more computational savings by relaxing
the optimality guarantees. The resulting algorithms are evaluated through
simulations.

comparing evolutionary trees. It has wide-ranging applications, such as to

Carlo phylogenetic inference. Although the rooted version of SPR distance can
be com puted relatively efficiently between rooted trees using
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms, in the unrooted case previous algorithms
are unable to compute distances larger than 7. One important tool for efficient
computation in the rooted case is called chain reduction, which replaces an
arbitrary chain of subtrees identical in both trees with a chain of three
leaves. Whether chain reduction preserves SPR distance in the unrooted case has
remained an open question since it was conjectured in 2001 by Allen and Steel,
and was presented as a challenge question at the 2007 Isaac Newton Institute
for Mathematical Sciences program on phylogenetics.
  In this paper we prove that chain reduction preserves the unrooted SPR
distance. We do so by introducing a structure called a socket agreement forest
that restricts edge modification to predetermined socket vertices, permitting
detailed analysis and modification of SPR move sequences. This new chain
reduction theorem reduces the unrooted distance problem to a linear size
problem kernel, substantially improving on the previous best quadratic size
kernel.

simulate uniaxial loading-unloading cycles imposed on the granular packings.
While macroscopic Mohr-friction depends on the granular pack geometric details,
it reaches a stationary limit after a finite number of loading-unloading cycles
that render well-defined values for bulk modulus, grain coordination, porosity,
and friction. For random packings and for all polydispersities analyzed, we
found that as inter-particle friction increases, the bulk modulus for the limit
cycle decreases linearly, while the mean coordination number is reduced and the
porosity increased, also as approximately linear functions. On the other hand,
the macroscopic Mohr-friction increases in a monotonous trend with
inter-particle friction. The latter result is compared to a theoretical model
which assumes the existence of sliding planes corresponding to definite
Mohr-friction values. The simulation results for macroscopic friction are well
described by the theoretical model that incorporates the local neighbour angle
distribution that can be quantified through the contact angle entropy. As local
friction is increased, the limit entropy of the neighbour angle distribution is
reduced, thus introducing the geometric component to granular friction.
Surprisingly, once the limit cycle is reached, the Mohr-friction seem to be
insensitive to polydispersity as has been recently reported.

to the Higgs data lead to central values of the Higgs couplings to the
bottom-quark and the top-quark that are about 2 $\sigma$ away from the SM

realized in the Next to Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the SM (NMSSM), for
heavy singlets and light MSSM-like Higgs bosons and scalar top quarks, but for
couplings that ruined the perturbative consistency of the theory up to the GUT

somewhat heavier stops, may be obtained in the presence of light singlets. An
interesting bonus of this scenario is the possibility of explaining an excess
of events observed in CP-even Higgs searches at LEP2.

volume-preserving algorithm to carry out long-term particle simulations of 10^7
sampled REs in 6D phase space, which involves simulation scale of 10^18
particle-steps, the largest ever achieved in fusion research. Our simulations
show that in a realistic fusion reactor, the concern of REs is not as serious
as previously thought. Specifically, REs are confined much better than
previously predicted and the maximum average energy is in the range of 150MeV,
less than half of previous estimate.

competitive performance and robustness in visual object tracking. On the other
hand, visual trackers are not typically used in multiple object tracking. In
this paper, we investigate how a robust visual tracker like KCF can improve
multiple object tracking. Since KCF is a fast tracker, many can be used in
parallel and still result in fast tracking. We build a multiple object tracking
system based on KCF and background subtraction. Background subtraction is
applied to extract moving objects and get their scale and size in combination
with KCF outputs, while KCF is used for data association and to handle
fragmentation and occlusion problems. As a result, KCF and background
subtraction help each other to take tracking decision at every frame. Sometimes
KCF outputs are the most trustworthy (e.g. during occlusion), while in some
other case, it is the background subtraction outputs. To validate the
effectiveness of our system, the algorithm is demonstrated on four urban video
recordings from a standard dataset. Results show that our method is competitive
with state-of-the-art trackers even if we use a much simpler data association

spectra obtained over several years with the du Pont telescope of Las Campanas

construct curves of radial velocity versus pulsation phase. From these we
estimated radial velocity amplitudes for metal lines (formed near the
photosphere) and Halpha Doppler cores (formed at small optical depths). We also
measured Halpha emission fluxes when they appear during primary light rises.
Spectra shifted to rest wavelengths, binned into small phase intervals, and
coadded were used to perform model atmospheric and abundance analyses. The
derived metallicities and those of some previous spectroscopic surveys were
combined to produce a new calibration of the Layden abundance scale. We then
divided our RRab sample into metal-rich (disk) and metal-poor (halo) groups at
[Fe/H]=-1.0. The atmospheres of RRab families, so defined, differ with respect
to (a) peak strength of Halpha emission flux, (b) Halpha radial velocity
amplitude, (c) dynamical gravity, (d) stellar radius variation, (e) secondary
acceleration during the photometric ""bump"" that precedes minimum light, and (g)

the bump in the metal-poor family, but not in the metal-rich one. Though all
RRab probably are core helium-burning horizontal branch stars, the metal-rich

mechanism design in small-cell base stations (SBSs) powered by renewable

If the SBS cannot handle the request, the user is blocked by the SBS and is
served by the macro-cell BS (MBS) instead, which typically consumes more
energy. We aim to minimize the ratio of user requests blocked by the SBS. With
finite battery capacity, Markov decision process based problem is formulated,
and the optimal policy is found by dynamic programming (DP). Two
threshold-based policies are proposed: the push-only threshold-based (POTB)
policy and the energy-efficient threshold-based (EETB) policy, and the
closed-form blocking probabilities with infinite battery capacity are derived.
Numerical results show that the proposed policies outperform the conventional
non-push policy if the content popularity changes slowly or the content request
generating rate is high, and can achieve the performance of the greedy optimal
threshold-based (GOTB) policy. In addition, the performance gap between the
threshold-based policies and the DP optimal policy is small when the energy
arrival rate is low or the request generating rate is high.

traditional A/B tests are often underpowered to identify these heterogeneous
effects. This is especially true when the set of unit-level attributes is
high-dimensional and our priors are weak about which particular covariates are
important. However, there are often observational data sets available that are
orders of magnitude larger. We propose a method to combine these two data
sources to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects. First, we use
observational time series data to estimate a mapping from covariates to
unit-level effects. These estimates are likely biased but under some conditions
the bias preserves unit-level relative rank orderings. If these conditions
hold, we only need sufficient experimental data to identify a monotonic,
one-dimensional transformation from observationally predicted treatment effects
to real treatment effects. This reduces power demands greatly and makes the
detection of heterogeneous effects much easier. As an application, we show how
our method can be used to improve Facebook page recommendations.

solve the relativistic Liouville equation on a Schwarzschild background

terms of appropriate symplectic coordinates on the cotangent bundle, and the
associated observables, including the particle current density and stress
energy-momentum tensor, are determined. Next, we explore the case where the
flow is steady-state and spherically symmetric. Assuming that in the asymptotic
region the gas is described by an equilibrium distribution function, we
determine the relevant parameters of the accretion flow as a function of the
particle density and the temperature of the gas at infinity. In particular, we
find that in the low temperature limit the tangential pressure at the horizon
is about an order of magnitude larger than the radial one, showing explicitly
that a collisionless gas, despite exerting kinetic pressure, behaves very
differently than an isotropic perfect fluid, and providing a partial
explanation for the known fact that the accretion rate is much lower than in

convergence results which show that a large class of (possibly nonstationary

refinement with imprecision. Then, we develop a bidirectional version of the
type system, which rules out excessive imprecision, and give a type-directed
translation to a target language with explicit casts. We prove that the static

well-typed if its type annotations are made less precise, and that making

therefore induces hybridization between these bands and various quantum Hall
phases emerge. We experimentally explore the evolution of Landau levels in
ABA-stacked trilayer graphene under electric field. We observe a variety of

qualitatively well explained by considering the hybridization between multiple
Landau levels possessing close Landau level indices and the hybridization
between every third Landau level orbitals due to the trigonal warping effect.
These observations are consistent with numerical calculations. The combination

multiple independent processes -- a salient limitation in many domains of human
cognition -- remains largely unexplored. In this paper we use a graph-theoretic

that tasks that \emph{need} to be multitasked rely on independent resources,
i.e., form a matching, and that tasks \emph{can} be multitasked without

monolayer produced by the random sequential adsorption of linear $k$-mers
(particles occupying $k$ adjacent sites) onto a square lattice is studied by
means of a Monte Carlo simulation. The $k$-mers are deposited on the substrate
until a jamming state is reached, i.e. a state where no one additional particle
can be placed because the presented voids are too small or of inappropriate
shapes. The presence of defects in the lattice (impurities) and of defects in
the $k$-mers with concentrations of $d_l$ and $d_k$, respectively, is assumed.
The defects in the lattice are distributed randomly before deposition and these
lattice sites are forbidden for the deposition of $k$-mers. The defects on the
$k$-mers are distributed randomly. The sites filled with $k$-mers have high
electrical conductivity whereas the empty sites, and the sites filled by either
types of defect have a low electrical conductivity, i.e., a high-contrast is
assumed. We examined isotropic (both the possible orientations of a particle
are equiprobable) and anisotropic (all particles are aligned along one given
direction, $y$) deposition. To calculate the effective electrical conductivity,
the monolayer was presented as a random resistor network (RRN) and the
Frank--Lobb algorithm was used. The effects of the concentrations of defects
$d_l$ and $d_k$ on the electrical conductivity for the values of $k = 2^n$,
where $n =1,2,\dots, 5$, were studied. Increase of both the $d_l$ and $d_k$
parameters values resulted in decreases in the value of $\sigma$ and the
suppression of percolation. Moreover, for anisotropic deposition the electrical
conductivity along the $y$ direction was noticeably larger than in the
perpendicular direction, $x$. Phase diagrams in the ($d_l, d_k$)-plane for
different values of $k$ were obtained.

through the core. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of these
produced temperature gradients on the radius and mass of the non-isothermal
modified Bonnor-Ebert spheres (MBES). Here, we use the parameter $\kappa$ to
represent the magnetic fluctuations through the molecular cloud cores. This
parameter introduces the change of magnetic filed strength in the length-scale.
The results show that increasing of $\kappa$ leads to an increase of the radius

a particular class of model based controllers, whose objective consists of a
nominal tracking objective and an additional learning objective. Here, the

controller in the presence of random measurement errors. The main contribution
of this paper is a formulation-tailored algorithm, which exploits the
particular structure of self-reflective MPC problems in order to speed-up the
online computation. It is shown that, in contrast to generic state-of-the-art
optimal control problem solvers, the proposed algorithm can solve the
self-reflective optimization problems with reasonable additional computational
effort and in real-time. The advantages of the proposed real-time scheme are
illustrated by applying the algorithm to a nonlinear process control problem in

outflow extracts matter, momentum and energy from the accretion region. Here we
analyzed a robust form of 2.5-dimensional viscous, resistive, advective
magnetized accretion-outflow coupling in BH systems, in the mean field
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) regime. We solve the complete set of coupled MHD
conservation equations self-consistently, through invoking a generalized
polynomial expansion in two dimensions. We perform a critical analysis of
accretion-outflow region and provide a complete quasi-analytical family of
solutions for advective flows. We obtain the physical plausible outflow
solutions at high turbulent viscosity parameter $\alpha \, (\ge 0.3)$, and at a
reduced scale-height, as magnetic stresses compress or squeeze the flow region.
We found that the value of the large-scale poloidal magnetic field $\bar B_P$
is enhanced with increasing geometrical thickness of the accretion flow. On the
other hand differential magnetic torque ($-r^2 \bar B_{\varphi} \bar B_z$)
increases with the increase in $\dot M$. $\bar B_P$, $-r^2 \bar B_{\varphi}
\bar B_z$ as well as the plasma beta $\beta_P$ get strongly augmented with the
increase in the value of $\alpha$, enhancing the transport of vertical flux
outwards. Our solutions indicate that magnetocentrifugal acceleration plausibly
plays a dominant role in effusing out plasma from the radial accretion flow in
moderately advective paradigm which are more centrifugally dominated, however
in strongly advective paradigm it is likely that the thermal pressure gradient
would play a more contributory role in the vertical transport of the plasma.

neural networks (SNNs) have been attracting a great deal of attention, notably
owning to their power efficiency, which can potentially allow us to implement a
low-power deep learning engine suitable for real-time/mobile applications.
However, implementing SNN-based deep learning remains challenging, especially
gradient-based training of SNNs by error backpropagation. We cannot simply
propagate errors through SNNs in conventional way because of the property of
SNNs that process discrete data in the form of a series. Consequently, most of
the previous studies employ a workaround technique, which first trains a
conventional weighted-sum deep neural network and then maps the learning
weights to the SNN under training, instead of training SNN parameters directly.
In order to eliminate this workaround, recently proposed is a new class of SNN
named deep spiking networks (DSNs), which can be trained directly (without a
mapping from conventional deep networks) by error backpropagation with
stochastic gradient descent. In this paper, we show that the initialization of
the membrane potential on the backward path is an important step in DSN
training, through diverse experiments performed under various conditions.
Furthermore, we propose a simple and efficient method that can improve DSN
training by controlling the initial membrane potential on the backward path. In
our experiments, adopting the proposed approach allowed us to boost the
performance of DSN training in terms of converging time and accuracy.

(initial coordinate, initial velocity) in $R^{2d}$. Moreover, all initial
coordinates are different and fill up some domain in $R^{d}$. Each particle
moves via normal Newtonian dynamics under influence of some external force, but
there is no interaction between particles. If the external force is bounded
then trajectories of any two particles in the phase space do not intersect.
More exactly, at any time moment any two particles have either different
coordinates or different velocities. The system is called regular if there are
no particle collisions in the coordinate space.
  The regularity condition is necessary for the velocity of the particle,
situated at a given time at a given space point, were uniquely defined. Then
the classical Euler equation for the field of velocities has rigorous meaning.
Though the continuum of particles is in fact a continuum medium, the crucial
notion of regularity was not studied in mathematical literature.
  It appeared that the seeming simplicity of the object (absence of
interaction) is delusive. Even for simple external forces we could not find
simple necessary and sufficient regularity conditions. However, we found a rich
list of examples, one-dimensional and mufti-dimensional, where we could get
regularity conditions on different time intervals. In conclusion we formulate

attracted much attention recently. Let us assume that the nodes of a network

at reconstructing the support and the non-zero values of its observed signal.
In the literature, distributed greedy algorithms have been proposed to tackle
this problem, among which the most reliable ones require a large amount of
transmitted data, which barely adapts to realistic network communication
constraints. In this work, we address the problem through a reweighted $\ell_1$
soft thresholding technique, in which the threshold is iteratively tuned based
on the current estimate of the support. The proposed method adapts to
constrained networks, as it requires only local communication among neighbors,
and the transmitted messages are indices from a finite set. We analytically
prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm and we show that it outperforms
the state-of-the-art greedy methods in terms of balance between recovery
accuracy and communication load.

electrodeposited Co/Cu multilayers with Cu layer thicknesses ranging from 0.5
nm to 4.5 nm. For thin Cu layers (up to 1.5 nm), anisotropic magnetoresistance
(AMR) was observed whereas multilayers with thicker Cu layers exhibited clear
giant magnetoresistance (GMR) behaviour. The GMR magnitude increased up to
about 3.5 to 4 nm Cu layer thickness and slightly decreased afterwards.
According to magnetic measurements, all samples exhibited ferromagnetic (FM)
behaviour. The relative remanence turned out to be about 0.75 for both AMR and
GMR type multilayers. This clearly indicates the absence of an
antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling between adjacent magnetic layers for Cu layers
even above 1.5 nm where the GMR effect occurs. The AMR behaviour at low spacer
thicknesses indicates the presence of strong FM coupling (due to, e.g.,
pin-holes in the spacer and/or areas of the Cu layer where the layer thickness
is very small). With increasing spacer thickness, the pin-hole density reduces
and/or the layer thickness uniformity improves which both lead to a weakening
of the FM coupling. This improvement in multilayer structure quality results in
a better separation of magnetic layers and the weaker coupling (or complete
absence of interlayer coupling) enables a more random magnetization orientation
of adjacent layers, all this leading to an increase of the GMR. Coercive field
and zero-field resistivity measurements as well as the results of a structural
study reported earlier on the same multilayers provide independent evidence for
the microstructural features established here. The large GMR reported
previously on such Co/Cu multilayers at Cu layer thicknesses around 1 nm can be
attributed to the presence of a fairly large superparamagnetic (SPM) fraction
rather than being due to a strong AF coupling.

polynomial by computing the eigenvalues of the companion matrix in $O(n^{2})$
time using $O(n)$ memory. We proved that the method is backward stable. Here we
introduce, as an alternative, a companion QZ algorithm that solves a
generalized eigenvalue problem for a companion pencil. More importantly, we
provide an improved backward error analysis that takes advantage of the special
structure of the problem. The improvement is also due, in part, to an
improvement in the accuracy (in both theory and practice) of the turnover
operation, which is the key component of our algorithms.
  We prove that for the companion QR algorithm, the backward error on the
polynomial coefficients varies linearly with the norm of the polynomial's
vector of coefficients. Thus the companion QR algorithm has a smaller backward
error than the unstructured QR algorithm (used by MATLAB's \texttt{roots}
command, for example), for which the backward error on the polynomial
coefficients grows quadratically with the norm of the coefficient vector. The
companion QZ algorithm has the same favorable backward error as companion QR,
provided that the polynomial coefficients are properly scaled.

hole (BH) enclosed in a cavity, leads to the formation of a BH with scalar
hair. Perturbative evidence for the stability of such hairy BHs has been
independently established, confirming they are the true endpoints of the

soliton-type solutions, which can be either stable or unstable. Using numerical
relativity techniques, we provide evidence that the time evolution of some of

item pricing, where a seller chooses prices for various goods in the market,
and then the buyers purchase utility-maximizing bundles at these given prices.
We formulate two somewhat general techniques for designing good pricing
algorithms for this setting: Price Doubling and Item Halving. Using these
techniques, we unify many of the existing results in the item pricing
literature under a common framework, as well as provide several new item
pricing algorithms for approximating both revenue and social welfare. More
specifically, for a variety of settings with item pricing, we show that it is
possible to deterministically obtain a log-approximation for revenue and a
constant-approximation for social welfare simultaneously: thus one need not
sacrifice revenue if the goal is to still have decent welfare guarantees. %In
addition, we provide a new black-box reduction from revenue to welfare based on
item pricing, which immediately gives us new revenue-approximation algorithms
(e.g., for gross substitutes valuations).
  The main technical contribution of this paper is a $O((\log m + \log
k)^2)$-approximation algorithm for revenue maximization based on the Item
Halving technique, for settings where buyers have XoS valuations, where $m$ is
the number of goods and $k$ is the average supply. Surprisingly, ours is the
first known item pricing algorithm with polylogarithmic approximations for such
general classes of valuations, and partially resolves an important open
question from the algorithmic pricing literature about the existence of item
pricing algorithms with logarithmic factors for general valuations. We also use
the Item Halving framework to form envy-free item pricing mechanisms for the
popular setting of multi-unit markets, providing a log-approximation to revenue
in this case.

margin domain transfer (MMDT) proposed by Hoffman et al., by introducing L2
distance constraints between samples of different domains; thus, our method is
denoted as MMDTL2. Motivated by the differences between the images taken by
narrow band imaging (NBI) endoscopic devices, we utilize different NBI devices
as different domains and estimate the transformations between samples of
different domains, i.e., image samples taken by different NBI endoscope
systems. We first formulate the problem in the primal form, and then derive the
dual form with much lesser computational costs as compared to the naive
approach. From our experimental results using NBI image datasets from two
different NBI endoscopic devices, we find that MMDTL2 is better than MMDT and
also support vector machines without adaptation, especially when NBI image

hierarchical analysis shows substructure compatible with that found in previous
specific studies of the area but with an objective, compact methodology that
allows us to homogeneously compare the structure of different clusters and

dynamically decoupled from NGC~ 2264, which could be related either with the
Outer Arm or Monoceros Ring. The results in this paper confirm the relationship
between structure in the RV phase-space subspace and different kinds of

are faster than the full fixed-point iteration (which updates all the
components).
  In this paper, we focus on the coordinate-update algorithms based on the
cyclic selection rules, where the ordering of coordinates in each cycle is
arbitrary. These algorithms are fast, but their convergence is unknown in the
fixed-point setting.
  When $T$ is a nonexpansive operator and has a fixed point, we show that the
sequence of coordinate-update iterates converges to a fixed point under proper
step sizes. This result applies to the primal-dual coordinate-update
algorithms, which have applications to optimization problems with nonseparable
nonsmooth objectives, as well as global linear constraints.
  Numerically, we apply coordinate-update algorithms with the cyclic, shuffled
cyclic, and random selection rules to $\ell_1$ robust least squares, a CT image
reconstruction problem, as well as nonnegative matrix factorization. They
converge much faster than the standard fixed-point iteration. Among the three

particles perform independent discrete-time random walks on an undirected
graph. Whenever two or more particles meet at a given node, they merge and
continue as a single random walk. The coalescence time is defined as the
expected time until only one particle remains, starting from one particle at
every node. Despite recent progress the coalescence time for graphs such as
binary trees, d-dimensional tori, hypercubes and more generally,
vertex-transitive graphs, remains unresolved. We provide a powerful toolkit
that results in tight bounds for various topologies including the
aforementioned ones. The meeting time is defined as the worst-case expected
time required for two random walks to arrive at the same node at the same time.
As a general result, we establish that for graphs whose meeting time is only
marginally larger than the mixing time (a factor of log^2 n), the coalescence
time of n random walks equals the meeting time up to constant factors. This
upper bound is complemented by the construction of a graph family demonstrating
that this result is the best possible up to constant factors. For
almost-regular graphs, we bound the coalescence time by the hitting time,
resolving the discrete-time variant of a conjecture by Aldous for this class of
graphs. Finally, we prove that for any graph the coalescence time is bounded by
O(n^3) (which is tight for the Barbell graph); surprisingly even such a basic
question about the coalescing time was not answered before this work. By
duality, our results give bounds on the voter model and therefore give bounds
on the consensus time in arbitrary undirected graphs. We also establish a new
bound on the hitting time and cover time of regular graphs, improving and
tightening previous results by Broder and Karlin, as well as those by Aldous
and Fill.

electronic properties of the adsorbates and the substrate in well-defined

aspects of the self-assembly. The first one focuses on non-covalent
self-assembly dealing with site-selectivity due to inherent moire pattern
present on 2D materials deposited on substrates. Modification of intermolecular
interactions and molecule-substrate interactions influences the assembly
drastically and 2D materials can also be used as a platform to carry out
covalent and metal-coordinated assembly. The second part deals with the
electronic properties of molecules adsorbed on 2D materials. By virtue of being
inert and possessing low density of states near the Fermi level, 2D materials
decouple molecules electronically from the underlying metal substrate and allow
high-resolution spectroscopy and imaging of molecular orbitals. The moire
pattern on the 2D materials causes site-selective gating and charging of
molecules in some cases. The last section covers the effects of self-assembled
organic molecules on the electronic properties of graphene as revealed by
spectroscopy and electrical transport measurements. Non-covalent
functionalization of 2D materials has already been applied for their
application as catalysts and sensors. With the current surge of activity on

multiple-output (MIMO) filterbank multicarrier (FBMC) modulations in the case
of strong channel frequency selectivity is presented. The users and the base
station (BS) communicate using space division multiple access (SDMA). The low
complexity proposed solution is based on a single tap per-subcarrier
precoding/decoding matrix at the base station (BS) in the downlink/uplink. As
opposed to classical approaches that assume flat channel frequency selectivity
at the subcarrier level, the BS does not make this assumption and takes into
account the distortion caused by channel frequency selectivity. The expression
of the FBMC asymptotic mean squared error (MSE) in the case of strong channel
selectivity derived in earlier works is developed and extended. The linear
precoders and decoders are found by optimizing the MSE formula under two design
criteria, namely zero forcing (ZF) or minimum mean squared error (MMSE).
Finally, simulation results demonstrate the performance of the optimized
design. As long as the number of BS antennas is larger than the number of
users, it is shown that those extra degrees of freedom can be used to
compensate for the channel frequency selectivity.

energy harvesting cognitive radio networks (CRNs). The delay optimal power
allocation is studied while taking into account the randomness of harvested
energy, data generation, channel state and the grid price. To guarantee primary
user (PU)'s transmission, its Signal-Interference-Ratio (SIR) should be no less
than a threshold. Each user, including PU as well as secondary user (SU), has
energy harvesting devices, and the PU can also purchases the grid power. Each
user is rational and selfish to minimize its own the buffer delay. We formulate
a stochastic Stackelberg game in a bilevel manner. After decoupling via
rewriting the objective and constraints, an equivalent tractable reconstruction
is derived. First, we give a distributive algorithm to obtain the Nash
equilibrium (NE) of the lower level SUs' noncooperative stochastic game.
Thereafter, the stochastic Stackelberg game is discussed under the
circumstances that there is no information exchange between PU and SU.
Distributed iterative algorithms are designed. Furthermore, a distributive
online algorithm is proposed. Finally, simulations are carried out to verify
the correctness and demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms.

e^U,\quad (x, t)\in\mathbb{R}^N\times[0,T), \quad \alpha > -1.$$ We construct
for this equation a solution which blows up in finite time $T > 0$ and
satisfies some prescribed asymptotic behavior. We also show that the
constructed solution and its gradient blow up in finite time $T$ simultaneously
at the origin, and find precisely a description of its final blowup profile. It
happens that the quadratic gradient term is critical in some senses, resulting
in the change of the final blowup profile in comparison with the case $\alpha =
0$. The proof of the construction inspired by the method of Merle and Zaag in
1997, relies on the reduction of the problem to a finite dimensional one, and
uses the index theory to conclude. One of the major difficulties arising in the
proof is that outside the \textit{blowup region}, the spectrum of the
linearized operator around the profile can never be made negative. Truly new
ideas are needed to achieve the control of the outer part of the solution.
Thanks to a geometrical interpretation of the parameters of the finite
dimensional problem in terms of the blowup time and the blowup point, we obtain
the stability of the constructed solution with respect to perturbations of the
initial data.

interaction with the field vacuum brings the qubit to a thermal state at the

to the challenges that are associated with the quality control and
characterization of this complex biological medicine from natural sources. The
present study addresses the need for simple and user-friendly analytical
methods for the fast and accurate quantification of heparin in complex
matrices. Direct quantification of heparin in the low microgram per mL range
was accomplished using a specific commercially available assay based on the
fluorescent molecular probe Heparin Red, simply by mixing the heparin
containing sample and a reagent solution in a 96-well microplate followed by
fluorescence readout. A screening of typical impurities in raw heparin
(selected other glycosaminoglycans, residual nucleic acids and proteins),
related to the extraction from animal tissues, as well as of components of the
urine matrix (inorganic salts, amino acids, trace proteins) revealed that these
compounds even in large excess have no or very little effect on the accuracy of
heparin determination. Heparin spike detection in urine, a biological
multicomponent matrix, also showed good accuracy. We envision applications of
this mix-and-read assay in the process and quality control in heparin

becomes an advantage. It allows the electrons to be cooled for an
experimentally useful period of time to temperatures colder than the dilution
refrigerator platform, the incoming electrical connections, and the host
lattice. There are efforts worldwide to reach sub-millikelvin electron
temperatures in nanostructures to study coherent electronic phenomena and
improve the operation of nanoelectronic devices. On-chip magnetic cooling is a
promising approach to meet this challenge. The method can be used to reach low,
local electron temperatures in other nanostructures, obviating the need to
adapt traditional, large demagnetisation stages. We demonstrate the technique
by applying it to a nanoelectronic primary thermometer that measures its
internal electron temperature. Using an optimised demagnetisation process, we
demonstrate cooling of the on-chip electrons from 9 mK to below 5 mK for over
1000 seconds.

the attacker to follow improbable traffic patterns, revealing his target and

for intractable likelihoods when it is possible to simulate from the model.
However they perform poorly for high dimensional data, and in practice must
usually be used in conjunction with dimension reduction methods, resulting in a
loss of accuracy which is hard to quantify or control. We propose a new ABC
method for high dimensional data based on rare event methods which we refer to
as RE-ABC. This uses a latent variable representation of the model. For a given
parameter value, we estimate the probability of the rare event that the latent
variables correspond to data roughly consistent with the observations. This is
performed using sequential Monte Carlo and slice sampling to systematically
search the space of latent variables. In contrast standard ABC can be viewed as
using a more naive Monte Carlo estimate. We use our rare event probability
estimator as a likelihood estimate within the pseudo-marginal
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for parameter inference.
  We provide asymptotics showing that RE-ABC has a lower computational cost for
high dimensional data than standard ABC methods. We also illustrate our
approach empirically, on a Gaussian distribution and an application in
infectious disease modelling.

paradigm in which the control plane of multiple networks is centralized. This
follows the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm, although at the
inter-domain level involving multiple Autonomous Systems (AS). Multi-domain SDN
centralization can be realized by outsourcing routing functions to an external
contractor, which provides inter-domain routing services facilitated through a
multi-AS network controller. The proposed model promises to become a vehicle
for evolving BGP and uses the bird's eye view over several networks to benefit
aspects of inter-domain routing, such as convergence properties, policy
conflict resolution, inter-domain troubleshooting, and collaborative security.
In addition to the proposed paradigm, we introduce a publicly available
emulation platform built on top of Mininet and the Quagga routing software, for
experimenting in hybrid BGP-SDN AS-level networks. As a proof of concept we
focus specifically on exploiting multi-domain centralization to improve BGP's
slow convergence. We build and make publicly available a first multi-AS
controller tailored to this use case and demonstrate experimentally that SDN
centralization helps to linearly reduce BGP convergence times and churn rates
with expanding SDN deployments.

applications in both man-made and natural systems. In particular, we study
systems with directed communication graphs that may change over time.
  We recently proposed a new family of convex combination algorithms in
dimension one whose weights depend on the received values and not only on the
communication topology. Here, we extend this approach to arbitrarily high
dimensions by introducing two new algorithms: the ExtremePoint and the Centroid
algorithm. Contrary to classical convex combination algorithms, both have
component-wise contraction rates that are constant in the number of agents.
Paired with a speed-up technique for convex combination algorithms, we get a
convergence time linear in the number of agents, which is optimal.
  Besides their respective contraction rates, the two algorithms differ in the
fact that the Centroid algorithm's update rule is independent of any coordinate
system while the ExtremePoint algorithm implicitly assumes a common agreed-upon
coordinate system among agents. The latter assumption may be realistic in some
man-made multi-agent systems but is highly questionable in systems designed for
the modelization of natural phenomena.
  Finally we prove that our new algorithms also achieve asymptotic consensus
under very weak connectivity assumptions, provided that agent interactions are
bidirectional.

average oxygen abundances by about 0.05 dex (the median value of the

abundances in nitrogen by about 0.1. The abundance excess decreases with
increasing galaxy mass and with decreasing environmental density. Since only a
small fraction of late-type galaxies is located in high-density environments
these galaxies do not have a significant influence on the general X/H - M
relation. The metallicity - mass relations for isolated galaxies and for
galaxies with neighbors are very similar. The mean shift of non-isolated
galaxies around the metallicity - mass relation traced by the isolated galaxies
is less than 0.01 dex for oxygen and less than 0.02 dex for nitrogen. The
scatter in the galactic chemical abundances is large for any number of neighbor
galaxies (at any environmental density), i.e., galaxies with both enhanced and

that environmental effects do not play a key role in evolution of late-type

reachability queries. In more than two decades since first proposals, several
approaches have been presented adopting on-line searches, hop labelling or
transitive closure compression. Transitive closure compression techniques
usually construct a graph reachability index, for example by decomposing the
graph into disjoint chains. As memory consumption is proportional to the number
of chains, the target of those algorithms is to decompose the graph into an
optimal number \width\ of chains. However, commonly used techniques fail to
meet general expectations, are exceedingly complex, and their application on
large graphs is impractical. The main contribution of this paper is a novel
approach to construct such reachability indexes. The proposed method decomposes
the graph into a sub-optimal number $\widehat{c}$ of chains by following a
greedy strategy. We show that, given a vertex topological order, such a
decomposition is obtained in $\mathcal{O}(\widehat{c} m)$ time, and requires
$\mathcal{O}(\widehat{c} n)$ space, with $\widehat{c}$ bounded by $[c
\log(\frac{n}{c})]$. We provide experimental evidence suggesting that, on
different categories of automatically generated benchmarks as well as on graphs
arising from the field of logic synthesis and formal verification, the proposed
method produces a number of chains very close to the optimum, while
significantly reducing computation time.

vdWs forces between neighboring layers depend on the number of layers. Compared
to that in bilayer, the interlayer coupling in trilayer vdW heterostructures
can significantly be enhanced by stacking the third layer, directly supported
by short interlayer separations and more interfacial charge transfer. The
trilayer shows strong light absorption over a wide range (<700 nm), making it
very potential for solar energy harvesting and conversion. Moreover, the Dirac

external electric field, verifying multilayer vdWs heterostructures with unqiue

measurements of relativistic physics, as well as significant contributions to

and dense satellite was chosen to reduce as much as possible the disturbing
effects of non-gravitational perturbations. However, because of its height,
about 1450 km compared with about 5800-5900 km for the two LAGEOS satellites,
LARES is exposed to a much stronger drag due to neutral atmosphere. From a
precise orbit determination, analyzing the laser ranging normal points of LARES
over a time span of about 3.7 years, it was found an average semi-major axis
decay rate of -0.999 m per year, corresponding to a non-conservative net force
with a mean along-track acceleration of -1.444 x 10^-11 m/s^2. By means of a
modified version of the SATRAP (ISTI/CNR) code, the neutral drag perturbation
acting on LARES was evaluated over the same time span, taking into account the
real evolution of solar and geomagnetic activities, with five thermospheric
density models. All of them were able to model most of the observed semi-major
axis decay, with differences among the average drag coefficients smaller than
10%. A further independent check carried out analyzing the orbital decay of a
passive spherical satellite (Ajisai) just 40 km higher than LARES, it was then
concluded that some of the currently best models developed for neutral
atmosphere, within their uncertainties and range of applicability, were able to
account for most (about 98.6%) of the observed semi-major axis decay of LARES.
Finally, after modeling the neutral atmosphere drag, a residual semi-major axis
decay, corresponding to an average along-track acceleration of about -2 x
10^-13 m/s^2 (i.e. about 1/72 of neutral drag), was detected as well.

suite detects seeded faults: one test suite is better than another if it
detects more mutants. Mutation analysis effectiveness rests on the assumption
that mutants are coupled with real faults i.e. mutant detection is strongly
correlated with real fault detection. The work that validated this also showed
that a large portion of defects remain out of reach.
  We introduce tailored mutation operators to reach and capture these defects.
Tailored mutation operators are built from and apply to an existing codebase
and its history. They can, for instance, identify and replay errors specific to
the project for which they are tailored. As our point of departure, we define
tailored mutation operators for identifiers, which mutation analysis has
largely ignored, because there are too many ways to mutate them. Evaluated on
the Defects4J dataset, our new mutation operators creates mutants coupled to
14% more faults, compared to traditional mutation operators.
  These new mutation operators, however, quadruple the number of mutants. To
combat this problem, we propose a new approach to mutant selection focusing on
the location at which to apply mutation operators and the unnaturalness of the
mutated code. The results demonstrate that the location selection heuristics
produce mutants more closely coupled to real faults for a given budget of
mutation operator applications.
  In summary, this paper defines and explores tailored mutation operators,
advancing the state of the art in mutation testing in two ways: 1) it suggests
mutation operators that mutate identifiers and literals, extending mutation
analysis to a new class of faults and 2) it demonstrates that selecting the
location where a mutation operator is applied decreases the number of generated
mutants without affecting the coupling of mutants and real faults.

distance between infinitesimally close quantum states and the second order
variation of the coherence of the optimal measurement basis with respect to the
state of the probe. In Quantum Phase Estimation protocols, this leads to
identify coherence as the relevant resource that one has to engineer and
control to optimize the estimation precision. Furthermore, the main object of
the theory i.e., the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative, in many cases allows to
identify a proper factorization of the whole Hilbert space in two subsystems.
The factorization allows: to discuss the role of coherence vs correlations in
estimation protocols; to show how certain estimation processes can be
completely or effectively described within a single-qubit subsystem; and to
derive lower bounds for the scaling of the estimation precision with the number
of probes used. We illustrate how the framework works for both noiseless and
noisy estimation procedures, in particular those based on multi-qubit
GHZ-states. Finally we succinctly analyze estimation protocols based on
zero-temperature critical behaviour. We identify the coherence that is at the

based on a galactic model and the planet occurrence rates measured by the
Kepler mission. It takes into account the observation window function and
measured noise levels of the investigated survey. Additionally, it includes
vetting criteria to identify false positives. We apply this simulator to the
Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS), a wide-field survey designed to detect
transiting Neptune-sized exoplanets. We find that red noise is the main
limitation of NGTS up to 14th magnitude, and that its obtained level determines
the expected yield. Assuming a red noise level of 1 mmag, the simulation
predicts the following for a four-year survey: 4+-3 Super-Earths, 19+-5 Small
Neptunes, 16+-4 Large Neptunes, 55+-8 Saturn-sized planets and 150+-10
Jupiter-sized planets, along with 4688+-45 eclipsing binaries and 843+-75

reduce the problem of finding correct input configurations to the task of

We leverage our synthesis algorithm to construct the first network-wide

Sun, since a detection of high energy neutrinos from it would be a very clean
indication of dark matter, given that no signicant astrophysical backgrounds

a better visibility than IceCube, due to its geographical location. This search
gives limits on the annihilation cross section. Other dark matter searches

an important phenomenon in the context of formation and evolution of massive

continue to be elusive. We use our Bayesian-motivated spectral energy
distribution (SED)-fitting code, BAYESCOOL, to estimate the plausible SFR
values in the brightest cluster galaxy of a massive, X-ray luminous galaxy
cluster, Phoenix. Previous studies of Phoenix have resulted in the highest
measurement of SFR for any galaxy, with the estimates reaching up to 1000 solar
masses/yr. However, a very small number of models have been considered in those
studies. BAYESCOOL allows us to probe a large parameter space. We consider two
models for star formation history, instantaneous bursts and continuous star
formation, a wide range of ages for the old and the young stellar population,
along with other discrete parameters, such as the initial mass function,
metallicities, internal extinction and extinction law. We find that in the
absence of any prior except that the maximum cooling rate < 3000 solar
masses/yr, the SFR lies in the range (2230-2890) solar masses/yr. If we impose
an observational prior on the internal extinction, E(B-V) < 0.6, the best-fit
SFR lies in (454-494) solar masses/yr, and we consider this as the most
probable range of SFR values for Phoenix. The SFR dependence on the extinction
is a reflection of the standard age-extinction degeneracy, which can be
overcome by using a prior on one of the two quantities in question.

indicates that the ring-down frequencies and lensing observables of the

speeds, these adiabatic and entropy modes are not generally the fundamental
(most natural to canonically quantise) degrees of freedom that propagate with a
single speed. The alternative fields which do propagate with a single speed are
found to be a rotation in field space of the adiabatic and entropy

curvature perturbation. Special cases of our results are discussed, including
$P(X)$ theories where the adiabatic and entropy perturbations are fundamental.

systems. The proposed approach is a control method that, rather than an entire
system model, requires a model of the subsystem of interest for controller
design. To design the retrofit controller, we use a novel approach based on
hierarchical state-space expansion that generates a higher-dimensional cascade
realization of a given network system. The upstream dynamics of the cascade
realization corresponds to an isolated model of the subsystem of interest,
which is stabilized by a local controller. The downstream dynamics can be seen
as a dynamical model representing the propagation of interference signals among
subsystems, the stability of which is equivalent to that of the original
system. This cascade structure enables a systematic analysis of both the
stability and control performance of the resultant closed-loop system. The
resultant retrofit controller is formed as a cascade interconnection of the
local controller and an output rectifier that rectifies an output signal of the
subsystem of interest so as to conform to an output signal of the isolated
subsystem model while acquiring complementary signals neglected in the local
controller design, such as interconnection signals from neighboring subsystems.
Finally, the efficiency of the retrofit control method is demonstrated through
numerical examples of power systems control and vehicle platoon control.

reproduces the experimental gravitational differential cross sections without
resorting to the graviton field and instead by exchanging SO(4) gauge fields.
By construction, each SO(4) generator in quantum gravitodynamics does not
commute with the Dirac gamma matrices. This produces additional interactions
absent to non-Abelian gauge fields in the Standard Model. The contributions
from these new terms yield differential cross sections consistent with the
Newtonian and post Newtonian interactions derived from General Relativity.
Dimensional analysis of the Lagrangian shows that all its terms have total
dimensionality four or less and therefore that all physical quantities in the
