expression profiling is being widely used in cancer studies to discover
informative biomarkers that aid predict different clinical endpoint prediction.
We use multiple modalities of data derived from RNA deep-sequencing (RNA-seq)
to predict survival of cancer patients. Despite the wealth of information
available in expression profiles of cancer tumors, fulfilling the
aforementioned objective remains a big challenge, for the most part, due to the
paucity of data samples compared to the high dimension of the expression
profiles. As such, analysis of transcriptomic data modalities calls for
state-of-the-art big-data analytics techniques that can maximally use all the
available data to discover the relevant information hidden within a significant
amount of noise. In this paper, we propose a pipeline that predicts cancer
patients' survival by exploiting the structure of the input (manifold learning)
and by leveraging the unlabeled samples using Laplacian support vector
machines, a graph-based semi supervised learning (GSSL) paradigm. We show that
under certain circumstances, no single modality per se will result in the best
accuracy and by fusing different models together via a stacked generalization
strategy, we may boost the accuracy synergistically. We apply our approach to
two cancer datasets and present promising results. We maintain that a similar
pipeline can be used for predictive tasks where labeled samples are expensive
to acquire.

$H^\pm$ heavier than around 490 GeV to avoid large contributions to $BR(b

relatively light scalar states in addition to the 125 GeV Higgs. For similar

use of convolutional neural networks. These networks are commonly trained, and
evaluated, on large annotated datasets of artifact-free high-quality images. In
this paper, we investigate the effect of one such artifact that is quite common
in natural capture settings: optical blur. We show that standard network
models, trained only on high-quality images, suffer a significant degradation
in performance when applied to those degraded by blur due to defocus, or
subject or camera motion. We investigate the extent to which this degradation
is due to the mismatch between training and input image statistics.
Specifically, we find that fine-tuning a pre-trained model with blurred images
added to the training set allows it to regain much of the lost accuracy. We
also show that there is a fair amount of generalization between different
degrees and types of blur, which implies that a single network model can be
used robustly for recognition when the nature of the blur in the input is
unknown. We find that this robustness arises as a result of these models
learning to generate blur invariant representations in their hidden layers. Our
findings provide useful insights towards developing vision systems that can
perform reliably on real world images affected by blur.

whose recurrent dynamics implement a second, quite separate RL procedure. This
second, learned RL algorithm can differ from the original one in arbitrary
ways. Importantly, because it is learned, it is configured to exploit structure
in the training domain. We unpack these points in a series of seven
proof-of-concept experiments, each of which examines a key aspect of deep
meta-RL. We consider prospects for extending and scaling up the approach, and

L-function of a spherical representation. These partition functions are used to
extend numerous results that were previously known only when the L-group is
connected (that is, when the p-adic group is split). We give explicit formulas
for branching rules, the inverse of the weight multiplicity matrix, the
Kato-Lusztig formula for the inverse Satake transform, the Plancherel measure,

probabilistic generative modeling family for natural language. They show
state-of-the-art language modeling and parsing performance. We investigate what
information they learn, from a linguistic perspective, through various
ablations to the model and the data, and by augmenting the model with an
attention mechanism (GA-RNNG) to enable closer inspection. We find that
explicit modeling of composition is crucial for achieving the best performance.
Through the attention mechanism, we find that headedness plays a central role
in phrasal representation (with the model's latent attention largely agreeing
with predictions made by hand-crafted head rules, albeit with some important
differences). By training grammars without nonterminal labels, we find that
phrasal representations depend minimally on nonterminals, providing support for
the endocentricity hypothesis.

transcription. Finding the exact location of these binding sites (aka motifs)
is important in a variety of domains such as drug design and development. To
address this need, several \textit{in vivo} and \textit{in vitro} techniques
have been developed so far that try to characterize and predict the binding
specificity of a protein to different DNA loci. The major problem with these
techniques is that they are not accurate enough in prediction of the binding
affinity and characterization of the corresponding motifs. As a result,
downstream analysis is required to uncover the locations where proteins of
interest bind. Here, we propose DeeperBind, a long short term recurrent
convolutional network for prediction of protein binding specificities with
respect to DNA probes. DeeperBind can model the positional dynamics of probe
sequences and hence reckons with the contributions made by individual
sub-regions in DNA sequences, in an effective way. Moreover, it can be trained
and tested on datasets containing varying-length sequences. We apply our
pipeline to the datasets derived from protein binding microarrays (PBMs), an
in-vitro high-throughput technology for quantification of protein-DNA binding
preferences, and present promising results. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the most accurate pipeline that can predict binding specificities of DNA
sequences from the data produced by high-throughput technologies through

performance of lock-free data structures. Lock-free data structures are based
on retry loops and are called by application-specific routines. In contrast to
previous work, we consider in this paper lock-free data structures in dynamic
environments. The size of each of the retry loops, and the size of the
application routines invoked in between, are not constant but may change
dynamically. The new frameworks follow two different approaches. The first
framework, the simplest one, is based on queuing theory. It introduces an
average-based approach that facilitates a more coarse-grained analysis, with
the benefit of being ignorant of size distributions. Because of this
independence from the distribution nature it covers a set of complicated
designs. The second approach, instantiated with an exponential distribution for

  Both frameworks provide a performance estimate which is close to what we
observe in practice. We have validated our analysis on (i) several fundamental
lock-free data structures such as stacks, queues, deques and counters, some of
them employing helping mechanisms, and (ii) synthetic tests covering a wide
range of possible lock-free designs. We show the applicability of our results
by introducing new back-off mechanisms, tested in application contexts, and by

cutting edges along a straight boundary introduced by Asboth and Edge (2015
Phys.Rev. A 91 022324) in order to study one-dimensional edge states
originating from topological phases of matter and to obtain collateral evidence
of how a quantum walker reacts to the boundary. Firstly, we connect this model
to the CMV matrix, which provides a 5-term recursion relation of the Laurent
polynomial associated with spectral measure on the unit circle. Secondly,we
explicitly derive the spectra of bulk and edge states of the quantum walk with
the boundary using spectral analysis of the CMV matrix. Thirdly, while
topological numbers of the model studied so far are well-defined only when gaps
in the bulk spectrum exist, we find a new topological number defined only when
there are no gaps in the bulk spectrum. We confirm that the existence of the
spectrum for edge states derived from the CMV matrix is consistent with the
prediction from a bulk-edge correspondence using topological numbers calculated
in the cases where gaps in the bulk spectrum do or do not exist. Finally, we
show how the edge states contribute to the asymptotic behavior of the quantum
walk through limit theorems of the finding probability. Conversely, we also
propose a differential equation using this limit distribution whose solution is
the underlying edge state.

describe the state-evolution of dynamical systems under stochastic uncertainty,
and have found widespread applications in various fields. In order to make
these models computationally tractable, they rely on a number of assumptions
that may not be realistic for the domain of application; in particular, the
ability to provide exact numerical parameter assessments, and the applicability
of time-homogeneity and the eponymous Markov property. In this work, we extend
these models to imprecise continuous-time Markov chains (ICTMC's), which are a
robust generalisation that relaxes these assumptions while remaining
computationally tractable.
  More technically, an ICTMC is a set of ""precise"" continuous-time finite-state
stochastic processes, and rather than computing expected values of functions,
we seek to compute lower expectations, which are tight lower bounds on the
expectations that correspond to such a set of ""precise"" models. Note that, in
contrast to e.g. Bayesian methods, all the elements of such a set are treated
on equal grounds; we do not consider a distribution over this set.
  The first part of this paper develops a formalism for describing
continuous-time finite-state stochastic processes that does not require the
aforementioned simplifying assumptions. Next, this formalism is used to
characterise ICTMC's and to investigate their properties. The concept of lower
expectation is then given an alternative operator-theoretic characterisation,
by means of a lower transition operator, and the properties of this operator
are investigated as well. Finally, we use this lower transition operator to
derive tractable algorithms (with polynomial runtime complexity w.r.t. the
maximum numerical error) for computing the lower expectation of functions that
depend on the state at any finite number of time points.

below those of conventional metals. Bipolarons form when carriers self-trap in
pairs. Coherently moving large-bipolarons require extremely large ratios of
static to optical dielectric-constants. The mutual Coulomb repulsion of a
planar large-bipolarons paired carriers drives it to a four-lobed shape. A
phonon-mediated attraction among large-bipolarons propels their condensation
into a liquid. This liquids excitations move slowly with a huge effective mass.
Excitations concomitant weak scattering by phonons produces a moderate
low-temperature dc resistivity that increases linearly with rising temperature.
With falling temperature an energy gap opens between large-bipolarons
excitations and those of their self-trapped electronic carriers.

in affinity among ligands. In addition, sensitivity to ligand concentration and
quick discrimination are also important to detect low amounts of target ligands
and facilitate fast cellular decision making after ligand recognition. In this
work, we find that ultraspecificity is naturally derived from a well-known
mechanism for zero-order ultrasensitivity to concentration. We also show that
this mechanism can produce an optimal balance of specificity, sensitivity, and
quick discrimination. Furthermore, we show that a model for insensitivity to

this notion of randomness for elements of $\mathcal{P}$ may be induced by a map
from $2^\omega$ onto $\mathcal{P}$ that is computable relative to

Kolmogorov complexity. Another approach is to define a relative measure on

becomes interesting if $\mathcal{P}$ has Lebesgue measure 0. Lastly, one can
alternatively define a notion of incompressibility for members of $\mathcal{P}$

some notions of homogeneity for $\Pi^0_1$ classes, inspired by work of van

string $\sigma$ in terms of the length of the shortest description $\sigma^*$

amount of information contained in the string. However, we may also view the
length of $\sigma$ as a measure of the cost of producing $\sigma$, which
permits one to generalize the notion of length, wherein the cost of producing a
0 or a 1 can vary in some prescribed manner.
  In this article, we initiate the study of this generalization of length based
on the above information cost interpretation. We also modify the definition of
Kolmogorov complexity to use such generalized length functions instead of
standard length. We further investigate conditions under which the notion of
complexity defined in terms of a given generalized length function preserves
some essential properties of Kolmogorov complexity. We focus on a specific
class of generalized length functions that are intimately related to a specific
subcollection of Bernoulli $p$-measures, namely those corresponding to the
unique computable real $p\in(0,1)$ such that $p^k=1-p$, for integers $k\geq 1$.
We then study randomness with respect to such measures, by proving a
generalization version of the classic Levin-Schnorr theorem that involves
$k$-length functions and then proving subsequent results that involve effective

qualitative detection, that is, the problem of determining on-line the current

by i) large parameter variability and redundancy, ii) a small number of
possible robust, qualitatively different dynamical behaviors and, iii) the

omnipresent in neurosciences and hamper quantitative modeling and fitting of
experimental data. As a result, novel control theoretical strategies are needed
to face neuroscience challenges like on-line epileptic seizure detection. The
proposed approach aims at detecting the current dynamical behavior of the
system and whether a qualitative change is likely to occur without
quantitatively fitting any model nor asymptotically estimating any parameter.
We talk of qualitative detection. We rely on the qualitative properties of the
system dynamics, extracted via singularity and singular perturbation theories,
to design low dimensional qualitative detectors. We introduce this concept on a
general class of singularly perturbed systems and then solve the problem for an

that Plummer's (1916) conclusion that the asteroids' eccentricities follow a
Rayleigh distribution holds for the osculating eccentricities of large
asteroids, but the proper eccentricities deviate from a Rayleigh distribution:
there is a deficit of eccentricities smaller than $\sim0.1$ and an excess of
larger eccentricities. We further find that the proper eccentricities do not
depend significantly on asteroid size but have strong dependence on
heliocentric distance: the outer asteroid belt follows a Rayleigh distribution,
but the inner belt is strikingly different. Eccentricities in the inner belt
can be modeled as a vector sum of a primordial eccentricity vector of random
orientation and magnitude drawn from a Rayleigh distribution of parameter
$\sim0.06$, and an excitation of random phase and magnitude $\sim0.13$. These
results imply that a late dynamical excitation of the asteroids occurred, it
was independent of asteroid size, it was stronger in the inner belt than in the
outer belt. We discuss implications for the primordial asteroid belt and
suggest that the observationally complete sample size of main belt asteroids is
large enough that more sophisticated model-fitting of the eccentricities is
warranted and could serve to test alternative theoretical models of the
dynamical excitation history of asteroids and its links to the migration
history of the giant planets.

oscillators is called a chimera state. We study such chimera states in a
network of neurons without any direct interactions but connected through
another medium of neurons, forming a multilayer structure. The upper layer is
thus made up of uncoupled neurons and the lower layer plays the role of a
medium through which the neurons in the upper layer share information among
each other. Hindmarsh-Rose neurons with square wave bursting dynamics are
considered as nodes in both layers. In addition, we also discuss the existence
of chimera states in presence of inter layer heterogeneity. The neurons in the
bottom layer are globally connected through electrical synapses, while across
the two layers chemical synapses are formed. According to our research, the
competing effects of these two types of synapses can lead to chimera states in
the upper layer of uncoupled neurons. Remarkably, we find a density-dependent
threshold for the emergence of chimera states in uncoupled neurons, similar to
the quorum sensing transition to a synchronized state. Finally, we examine the
impact of both homogeneous and heterogeneous inter-layer information
transmission delays on the observed chimera states over a wide parameter space.

examined these two aspects separately without looking at how they are linked.
The study aims to connect two aspects by investigating whether there is any
correlation between social connections and users' check-in locations from a
socio-geographic perspective. We constructed three types of networks: a
people-people network, a location-location network, and a city-city network
from former location-based social media Brightkite and Gowalla in the U.S.,
based on users' check-in locations and their friendships. We adopted some
complexity science methods such as power-law detection and head/tail breaks
classification method for analysis and visualization. Head/tail breaks
recursively partitions data into a few large things in the head and many small
things in the tail. By analyzing check-in locations, we found that users'
check-in patterns are heterogeneous at both the individual and collective
levels. We also discovered that users' first or most frequent chec-in locations
can be the representatives of users' spatial information. The constructed
networks based on these locations are very heterogeneous, as indicated by the
high ht-index. Most importantly, the node degree of the networks correlates
highly with the population at locations (mostly with R-square being 0.7) or
cities (above 0.9). This correlation indicates that the geographic
distributions of the social media users relate highly to their online social
connections.

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of various approaches of video
processing for object detection and tracking in the maritime environment. We
follow an approach-based taxonomy wherein the advantages and limitations of
each approach are compared. The object detection system consists of the
following modules: horizon detection, static background subtraction and
foreground segmentation. Each of these has been studied extensively in maritime
situations and has been shown to be challenging due to the presence of
background motion especially due to waves and wakes. The main processes
involved in object tracking include video frame registration, dynamic
background subtraction, and the object tracking algorithm itself. The
challenges for robust tracking arise due to camera motion, dynamic background
and low contrast of tracked object, possibly due to environmental degradation.
The survey also discusses multisensor approaches and commercial maritime
systems that use EO sensors. The survey also highlights methods from computer
vision research which hold promise to perform well in maritime EO data
processing. Performance of several maritime and computer vision techniques is
evaluated on newly proposed Singapore Maritime Dataset.

experimental limits set on R-parity conserving scenarios, the naturalness of
supersymmetry could still be safely concealed in the more challenging final
states predicted by the existence of non-null R-parity violating couplings.
Although R-parity violating signatures are extensively looked for at the Large
Hadron Collider, these searches always assume 100\% branching ratios for the
direct decays of supersymmetric particles into Standard Model ones. In this
paper we scrutinize the implications of relaxing this assumption by focusing on
one motivated scenario where the lightest stop is heavier than a chargino and a
neutralino. Considering a class of R-parity baryon number violating couplings,
we show on general grounds that while the direct decay of the stop into
Standard Model particles is dominant for large values of these couplings,
smaller values give rise, instead, to the dominance of a plethora of longer
decay chains and richer final states that have not yet been analyzed at the
LHC, thus weakening the impact of the present experimental stop mass limits. We
characterize the case for R-parity baryon number violating couplings in the
$10^{-7} - 10^{-1}$ range, in two different benchmark points scenarios within
the model-independent setting of the low-energy phenomenological Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model. We identify the different relevant experimental
signatures, estimate the corresponding proton--proton cross sections at

parameter, are characterized by a considerable supercooling and high velocities
of phase transition fronts. A very strong phase transition may have important
cosmological consequences due to the departures from equilibrium caused in the
plasma. In general, there is a limit to the strength, since the metastability
of the old phase may prevent the transition to complete. Near this limit, the
bubble nucleation rate achieves a maximum and thus departs from the widely
assumed behavior in which it grows exponentially with time. We study the
dynamics of this kind of phase transitions. We show that in some cases a
gaussian approximation for the nucleation rate is more suitable, and in such a
case we solve analytically the evolution of the phase transition. We compare
the gaussian and exponential approximations with realistic cases and we
determine their ranges of validity. We also discuss the implications for cosmic
remnants such as gravitational waves.

in the collapse of biodiversity due to the accidental extinction of one species
in the loop. Previous research has shown that such oscillations can emerge if
the interaction network has small-world properties, and more generally, because
of long-range interactions among individuals or because of mobility. But
although these features are all common in nature, global oscillations are
rarely observed in actual biological systems. This begets the question what is
the missing ingredient that would prevent local oscillations to synchronize
across the population to form global oscillations. Here we show that, although
heterogeneous species-specific invasion rates fail to have a noticeable impact
on species coexistence, randomness in site-specific invasion rates successfully
hinders the emergence of global oscillations and thus preserves biodiversity.
Our model takes into account that the environment is often not uniform but
rather spatially heterogeneous, which may influence the success of microscopic
dynamics locally. This prevents the synchronization of locally emerging
oscillations, and ultimately results in a phenomenon where one type of
randomness is used to mitigate the adverse effects of other types of randomness
in the system.

seesaw mechanism involving only two right-handed neutrinos. % This model
represents an important minimal benchmark scenario for future experimental
updates on neutrino oscillations. % It features four real parameters that
cannot be fixed by the current data: two $CP$-violating phases, $\delta$ and
$\sigma$, as well as one complex parameter, $z$, that is experimentally
inaccessible at low energies. % The parameter $z$ controls the structure of the
neutrino Yukawa matrix at high energies, which is why it may be regarded as a
label or index for all UV completions of the minimal seesaw model. % The fact
that $z$ encompasses only two real degrees of freedom allows us to
systematically scan the minimal seesaw model over all of its possible UV
completions. % In doing so, we address the following question: Suppose $\delta$
and $\sigma$ should be measured at particular values in the future---to what
extent is one then still able to realize approximate textures in the neutrino
Yukawa matrix? % Our analysis, thus, generalizes previous studies of the
minimal seesaw model based on the assumption of exact texture zeros. % In
particular, our study allows us to assess the theoretical uncertainty inherent
to the common texture ansatz. % One of our main results is that a normal
light-neutrino mass hierarchy is, in fact, still consistent with a two-zero
Yukawa texture, provided that the two texture zeros receive corrections at the
level of $\mathcal{O}\left(\textrm{10}\,\%\right)$. % While our numerical
results pertain to the minimal seesaw model only, our general procedure appears
to be applicable to other neutrino mass models as well.

measure the correlations between the centroid frequencies of the quasi-periodic

relativistic precession model (RPM) that, due to frame dragging, a QPO will
occur at the Lense-Thirring precession frequency $\nu_{LT}$ of a test particle
orbit whose orbital frequency is the upper kHz QPO frequency $\nu_u$. Contrary
to the most prominent previous studies, we find two different oscillations in
the range predicted for $\nu_{LT}$ that are simultaneously present over a wide
range of $\nu_u$. Additionally, one of the low frequency noise components
evolves into a (third) QPO in the $\nu_{LT}$ range when $\nu_u$ exceeds 600 Hz.
The frequencies of these QPOs all correlate to $\nu_u$ following power laws
with indices between 0.4$-$3.3, significantly exceeding the predicted value of
2.0 in 80$\%$ of the cases (at 3 to >20$\sigma$). Also, there is no evidence
that the neutron star spin frequency affects any of these three QPO frequencies
as would be expected for frame dragging. Finally, the observed QPO frequencies
tend to be higher than the $\nu_{LT}$ predicted for reasonable neutron star
specific moment of inertia. In the light of recent successes of precession
models in black holes, we briefly discuss ways in which such precession can
occur in neutron stars at frequencies different from test particle values and
consistent with those observed. A precessing torus geometry and other torques
than frame dragging may allow precession to produce the observed frequency
correlations, but can only explain one of the three QPOs in the $\nu_{LT}$
range.

cosmic times. We use HST/ACS images of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts
from the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS) to identify clumps within a 20 kpc
radius. We find that the population of galaxies with more than one clump is
dominated by galaxies with two clumps, representing $\sim21-25$\% of the
population, while the fraction of galaxies with 3, or 4 and more, clumps is
8-11 and 7-9\%, respectively. The fraction of clumpy galaxies is in the range
$\sim35-55\%$ over $2<z<6$, increasing at higher redshifts, indicating that the
fraction of irregular galaxies remains high up to the highest redshifts. The
large and bright clumps (M$_{\star}\sim10^9$ up to $\sim10^{10}$M$_\odot$) are
found to reside predominantly in galaxies with two clumps. Smaller and lower
luminosity clumps ($\log_{10}\left(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M_\odot}\right)<9$) are
found in galaxies with three clumps or more. We interpret these results as
evidence for two different modes of clump formation working in parallel. The
small low luminosity clumps are likely the result of disc fragmentation, with
violent disc instabilities (VDI) forming several long-lived clumps in-situ, as
suggested from simulations. A fraction of these clumps is also likely coming
from minor mergers. The clumps in the dominating population of galaxies with
two clumps are significantly more massive and have properties akin to those in
merging pairs observed at similar redshifts; they appear as more massive than
the most massive clumps observed in VDI numerical simulations.

and size at $z\sim1$ and 0; the main population of ETGs changes from disky to
boxy at a critical stellar mass of $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})\sim11.5$ with the
massive end dominated by boxy. The disky ETG fraction decreases with increasing
stellar mass both at $z\sim1$ and $0$, and is consistent between these
redshifts in all stellar mass bins when the Eddington bias is taken into
account. Although uncertainties are large, the results suggest that the
isophote shapes and probably dynamical properties of ETGs in massive clusters
are already in place at $z>1$ and do not significantly evolve in $z<1$, despite
significant size evolution in the same galaxy population. The constant disky

gauge the influence of primordial mass segregation, stellar evolution and the
tidal field at the solar distance. We also assess the impact of the
star-formation efficiency and gas expulsion velocity. We perform N-body

in their embedded phase and approximate the gas expulsion by means of an
exponentially depleting external gravitational field. We follow the process of
re-virialization through detailed monitoring of different Lagrange radii over
several Myr, examining initial half-mass radii of 0.1 pc, 0.3 pc and 0.5 pc and
initial masses usually ranging from $5\times10^3 M_\odot$ to $5\times10^4
M_\odot$. The adopted star-formation efficiency of 0.33 in the cluster volume
results in a distinct sensitivity to the gas expulsion velocity over a wide
mass range, while a variation of the star-formation efficiency can make the
cluster robust to the rapidly decreasing external potential. We confirm that
primordial mass segregation leads to a smaller bound fraction, its influence
possibly decreasing with mass. Stellar evolution has a higher impact on lower
mass clusters, but heating through dynamical friction could expand the cluster
to a similar extent. The examined clusters expand well within their tidal radii
and would survive gas expulsion even in a strong tidal field.

that MOND-like effects can be achieved on small scales whilst preserving the

of spherical models of galaxy clusters in the context of superfluid dark
matter. We first outline the theoretical structure of the superfluid core and
the surrounding ""normal phase"" dark halo of quasi-particles in thermal
equlibrium. The latter should encompass the largest part of galaxy clusters.
Here, we set the SfDM transition at the radius where the density and pressure
of the superfluid and normal phase coincides, neglecting the effect of phonons
in the suprefluid core. We then apply the theory to a sample of galaxy
clusters, and directly compare the SfDM predicted mass profiles to data. We
find that the superfluid formulation can reproduce the X-ray dynamical mass
profile of clusters. The SfDM fits however display slight under-predictions of
the gravity in the central regions which might be partly related to our
neglecting of the effect of phonons in these regions. We conclude that this
superfluid formulation is successful in describing galaxy clusters, but further
work will be needed to determine whether the parameter choice is consistent
with galaxies. Our model could be made more realistic by exploring
non-sphericity and the SfDM transition condition we impose.

based variational ansatz that is capable of capturing many of the key physical
properties of strongly correlated ground states such as criticality and
topological order. MERA also shares many deep relationships with the AdS/CFT
(gauge-gravity) correspondence by realizing a UV complete holographic duality
within the tensor networks framework. Motivated by this, we have re-purposed
the MERA tensor network as an analysis tool to study the real-time evolution of
the 1D transverse Ising model in its low energy excited state sector. We
performed this analysis by allowing the ancilla qubits of the MERA tensor
network to acquire quantum fluctuations, which yields a unitary transform
between the physical (boundary) and ancilla qubit (bulk) Hilbert spaces. This
then defines a reversible quantum circuit which is used as a `holographic
transform' to study excited states and their real-time dynamics from the point
of the bulk ancillae. In the gapped paramagnetic phase of the transverse field
Ising model, we demonstrate the holographic duality between excited states
induced by single spin-flips (Ising `magnons') acting on the ground state and
single ancilla qubit spin-flips. The single ancillae qubit excitation is shown
to be stable in the bulk under real-time evolution and hence defines a stable
holographic quasiparticle which we have named the `hologron'. The `dictionary'
between the bulk and boundary is determined and realizes many features of the
holographic correspondence in a non-CFT limit of the boundary theory. As an
added spin-off, this dictionary together with the extension to multi-hologron
sectors gives us a systematic way to construct quantitatively accurate low
energy effective Hamiltonians.

lightest charged twin fermions, the twin sector contains a light photon and
neutrinos, which can modify structure formation relative to the prediction from
the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. We focus on two scenarios. First, we study a
Fraternal Twin Higgs model in which the spin-3/2 baryon
$\hat{\Omega}\sim(\hat{b}\hat{b}\hat{b})$ and the lepton twin tau $\hat{\tau}$
contribute to the dominant and subcomponent dark matter densities. A
non-decoupled scattering between the twin tau and twin neutrino arising from a
gauged twin lepton number symmetry provides a drag force that damps the density
inhomogeneity of a dark matter subcomponent. Next, we consider the possibility
of having the twin hydrogen atom $\hat{H}$ as the dominant DM component. After
recombination, a small fraction of the twin protons and leptons remains ionized
during structure formation, and their scattering to twin neutrinos through a
gauged U$(1)_{B-L}$ force provides the mechanism that damps the density
inhomogeneity. Both scenarios realize the Partially Acoustic dark matter
(PAcDM) scenario and explain the $\sigma_8$ discrepancy between the CMB and
weak lensing results. Moreover, the self-scattering neutrino behaves as a dark
fluid that enhances the size of the Hubble rate $H_0$ to accommodate the local
measurement result while satisfying the CMB constraint. For the small-scale
structure, the scattering of $\hat{\Omega}$'s and $\hat{H}$'s through the twin
photon exchange generates a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model that
solves the mass deficit problem from dwarf galaxy to galaxy cluster scales.

to outflow-driven bubbles in the bicone and varies dramatically on scales of
~10 pc. Multiple findings show likely contributions from shocks to the feedback
in regions where radio outflows from the AGN most directly influence the ISM.

of sources in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) and COSMOS fields for which
ultra-deep VIMOS spectroscopy as well as multi-wavelength Hubble Space

  We select a sample of 46 galaxies at $z\sim 4$ from the VIMOS Ultra Deep
Survey (VUDS) database, such that the VUDS spectra contain the LyC part of the
spectra, that is, the rest-frame range $880-910\AA$. Taking advantage of the
HST imaging, we apply a careful cleaning procedure and reject all the sources
showing nearby clumps with different colours, that could potentially be
lower-redshift interlopers. After this procedure, the sample is reduced to 33
galaxies. We measure the ratio between ionizing flux (LyC at $895\AA$) and
non-ionizing emission (at $\sim 1500 \AA$) for all individual sources. We also
produce a normalized stacked spectrum of all sources. Assuming an intrinsic
average $L_{\nu}(1470)/L_{\nu}(895)$ of 3, we estimate the individual and
average relative escape fraction. We do not detect ionizing radiation from any
individual source, although we identify a possible LyC emitter with very high
Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW). From the stacked spectrum and assuming a mean
transmissivity for the sample, we measure a relative escape fraction
$f_{esc}^{rel}=0.09\pm0.04$. We also look for correlations between the limits
in the LyC flux and source properties and find a tentative correlation between
LyC flux and the EW of the Ly$\alpha$ emission line.
  Our results imply that the LyC flux emitted by $V=25-26$ star-forming
galaxies at z$\sim$4 is at most very modest, in agreement with previous upper
limits from studies based on broad and narrow band imaging.

A direct consequence of this tilt are nonvanishing runnings $\alpha_s=\mathrm d
n_s/\mathrm d\log k$, and $\beta_s=\mathrm d\alpha_s/\mathrm d\log k$, which in
the minimal inflationary scenario should reach absolute values of $10^{-3}$ and
$10^{-5}$, respectively. In this work we calculate how well future surveys can
measure these two runnings. We consider a Stage-4 (S4) CMB experiment and show
that it will be able to detect significant deviations from the inflationary
prediction for $\alpha_s$, although not for $\beta_s$. Adding to the S4 CMB
experiment the information from a WFIRST-like or a DESI-like survey improves
the sensitivity to the runnings by $\sim$ 20\%, and 30\%, respectively. A
spectroscopic survey with a billion objects, such as the SKA, will add enough
information to the S4 measurements to allow a detection of $\alpha_s=10^{-3}$,
required to probe the single-field slow-roll inflationary paradigm. We show
that only a very-futuristic interferometer targeting the dark ages will be
capable of measuring the minimal inflationary prediction for $\beta_s$. The
results of other probes, such as a stochastic background of gravitational waves
observable by LIGO, the Ly-$\alpha$ forest, and spectral distortions, are shown
for comparison. Finally, we study the claims that large values of $\beta_s$, if
extrapolated to the smallest scales, can produce primordial black holes of tens
of solar masses, which we show to be easily testable by the S4 CMB experiment.

It has been consistently observed in systems without inversion symmetry and
depends on non-universal material details. Here we find that in a class of Weyl
semimetals (e.g. SrSi$_2$) and three-dimensional Rashba materials (e.g. doped
Te) without inversion and mirror symmetries, the injection contribution to the
CPGE trace is effectively quantized in terms of the fundamental constants $e,
h, c$ and $\epsilon_0$ with no material-dependent parameters. This is so
because the CPGE directly measures the topological charge of Weyl points, and
non-quantized corrections from disorder and additional bands can be small over
a significant range of incident frequencies. Moreover, the magnitude of the
CPGE induced by a Weyl node is relatively large, which enables the direct
detection of the monopole charge with current techniques.

optical spectroscopic observations of a larger sample of 51 BDDs, along with
their SDSS photometric properties. With our improved statistics, we use
direct-method abundances to confirm that BDDs are chemically unevolved

M_sol/yr in HII regions randomly embedded in a blue, low-surface brightness
continuum. Stellar masses are calculated from population synthesis models and
estimated to be in the range log(M_star/M_sol) ~5-9. Unlike other
low-metallicity star-forming galaxies, BDDs are in agreement with the
mass-metallicity relation at low masses, suggesting they are not accreting
large amounts of pristine gas relative to their stellar mass. BDD galaxies
appear to be a population of actively star-forming dwarf irregular (dIrr)
galaxies who fall within the class of low-surface brightness dIrr galaxies.
Their ongoing star-formation and irregular morphology make them excellent

the space of all possible Ising model realizations, the question arises as to
how to choose a reasonable number of samples that will form physically
meaningful and non-intersecting training and testing datasets. Here, we propose
a sampling technique called ID-MH that uses the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
creating Markov process across energy levels within the predefined
configuration subspace. We show that application of this method retains phase
transitions in both training and testing datasets and serves the purpose of
validation of a machine learning algorithm. For larger lattice dimensions,
ID-MH is not feasible as it requires knowledge of the complete configuration
space. As such, we develop a new ""block-ID"" sampling strategy: it decomposes
the given structure into square blocks with lattice dimension no greater than 5
and uses ID-MH sampling of candidate blocks. Further comparison of the
performance of commonly used machine learning methods such as random forests,
decision trees, k nearest neighbors and artificial neural networks shows that
the PCA-based Decision Tree regressor is the most accurate predictor of
magnetizations of the Ising model. For energies, however, the accuracy of
prediction is not satisfactory, highlighting the need to consider more
algorithmically complex methods (e.g., deep learning).

z=6, 7 and 8 to derive constraints on warm dark matter (WDM), late-forming dark

the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. To this purpose we have run a suite of
high-resolution N-body simulations to accurately characterise the low mass-end
of the halo mass function and derive DM model predictions of the high-z
luminosity function. In order to convert halo masses into UV-magnitudes we
introduce an empirical approach based on halo abundance matching which allows
us to model the LF in terms of the amplitude and scatter of the ensemble
average star formation rate halo mass relation of each DM model, $\langle {\rm
SFR}({\rm M_{ h}},z)\rangle$. We find that independent of the DM scenario the
average SFR at fixed halo mass increases from z=6 to 8, while the scatter
remains constant. At halo mass ${\rm M_{h}}\gtrsim 10^{12}\,{\rm M}_\odot$
h$^{-1}$ the average SFR as function of halo mass follows a double power law
trend that is common to all models, while differences occur at smaller masses.
In particular, we find that models with a suppressed low-mass halo abundance
exhibit higher SFR compared to the CDM results. Using deviance statistics we
obtain a lower limit on the WDM thermal relic particle mass, $m_{\rm
WDM}\gtrsim 1.5$ keV at $2\sigma$. In the case of LFDM models, the phase
transition redshift parameter is bounded to $z_t\gtrsim 8\cdot 10^5$ at
$2\sigma$. We find ULADM best-fit models with axion mass $m_a\gtrsim 1.6\cdot
10^{-22}$ eV to be well within $2\sigma$ of the deviance statistics. We remark
that measurements at $z=6$ slightly favour a flattening of the LF at faint
UV-magnitudes. This tends to prefer some of the non-CDM models in our
simulation suite, although not at a statistically significant level to
distinguish them from CDM.

electrical charge transport. The promise of efficient parallel data processing
and low power consumption renders this field one of the most promising research
areas in spintronics. In this context, the process of parallel parametric
amplification, i.e., the conversion of microwave photons into magnons at one
half of the microwave frequency, has proven to be a versatile tool. Its
beneficial and unique properties, such as frequency and mode-selectivity, the
possibility to excite spin waves in a wide wavevector range and the creation of
phase-correlated wave pairs, render it one of the key methods of spin-wave
generation and amplification.
  The application of parallel parametric amplification to micro- and
nanostructures is an important step towards the realization of magnonic
networks. This is motivated not only by the fact that amplifiers are an
important tool for the construction of any extended logic network but also by
the unique properties of parallel parametric amplification, such as a
phase-dependent amplification. Recently, the successful application of parallel
parametric amplification to metallic microstructures has been reported. It has
been demonstrated that parametric amplification provides an excellent tool to
generate and to amplify spin waves in these systems. In particular, the
amplification greatly benefits from the discreteness of the spin-wave spectra.
This opens up new, interesting routes of spin-wave amplification and
manipulation. In this Review, we give an overview over the recent developments

The squared EMD loss uses the predicted probabilities of all classes and
penalizes the miss-predictions according to a ground distance matrix that

other neurons or the outside world [1]. To maintain connectivity as the
organism grows, dendrites must also continue to grow. For example, the
dendrites in the peripheral nervous system continue to grow and branch to
maintain proper coverage of their receptor fields [2, 3, 4, 5]. One such neuron
is the Drosophila melanogaster class IV dendritic arborization neuron [6]. The
dendritic arbors of these neurons tile the larval surface [7], where they
detect localized noxious stimuli, such as jabs from parasitic wasps [8]. In the
present study, we used a novel measure, the hitting probability, to show that
the class IV neuron forms a tight mesh that covers the larval surface.
Furthermore, we found that the mesh size remains largely unchanged during the
larval stages, despite a dramatic increase in overall size of the neuron and
the larva. We also found that the class IV dendrites are dense (assayed with
the fractal dimension) and uniform (assayed with the lacunarity) throughout the
larval stages. To understand how the class IV neuron maintains its morphology
during larval development, we constructed a mathematical model based on random
branching and self-avoidance. We found that if the branching rate is uniform in
space and time and that if all contacting branches are deleted, we can
reproduce the branch length distribution, mesh size and density of the class IV
dendrites throughout the larval stages. Thus, a simple set of statistical rules
can generate and maintain a complex branching morphology during growth.

validate that influence sketching can reliably and successfully discover
influential samples by applying the technique to a malware detection dataset of
over 2 million executable files, each represented with almost 100,000 features.
For example, we find that randomly deleting approximately 10% of training
samples reduces predictive accuracy only slightly from 99.47% to 99.45%,
whereas deleting the same number of samples with high influence sketch scores
reduces predictive accuracy all the way down to 90.24%. Moreover, we find that
influential samples are especially likely to be mislabeled. In the case study,
we manually inspect the most influential samples, and find that influence
sketching pointed us to new, previously unidentified pieces of malware.

exoplanets, their host stars, and their mutual interactions. In addition to the
transits of a planet in front of its star and the eclipses of the planet by its
star, researchers have reported flux variations at the orbital frequency and
its harmonics: planetary reflection and/or emission and Doppler beaming of
starlight produce one peak per orbit, while ellipsoidal variations of a tidally
distorted star and/or planet produce two maxima per orbit. Researchers have
also reported significant photometric variability at three times the orbital
frequency, sometimes much greater than the predictions of tidal theory. The
reflected phase variations of a homogeneous planet contains power at even
orbital harmonics-important for studies of ellipsoidal variations-but cannot
contain odd orbital harmonics. We show that odd harmonics can, however, be
produced by an edge-on planet with a time-variable map, or an inclined planet
with a North-South (N-S) asymmetric map. Either of these scenarios entail
weather: short-period planets are expected to have zero obliquity and hence N-S
symmetric stellar forcing. North-South asymmetry in a giant planet would
therefore suggest stochastic localized features, such as weather. However, we
find that previous claims of large-amplitude odd modes in Kepler photometry are
artifacts of removing planetary transits rather than modeling them. The only
reliable claims of odd harmonics remain HAT-P-7b and Kepler-13Ab, for which the
third mode amplitude is 6-8% of the planetary flux. Although time-variable
albedo maps could in principle explain these odd harmonics, upper-limits on the
infrared variability of hot Jupiters make this hypothesis unlikely. We urge
theorists to study the effects of close-in planets on stellar atmospheres, as
this remains the only plausible hypothesis.

out-of-plane surface phonons. Comparing with first principle calculations, we
conclude that the appearance of these modes is due to $c$-axis lattice

infrared active bulk phonons with $A_{2u}$ symmetry. The latter become Raman
allowed due to reduction of crystalline symmetry from $D_{3d}$ in the bulk to
$C_{3v}$ on the crystal surface. In particular, the 158 cm$^{-1}$ surface
phonon mode shows a Fano lineshape under resonant excitation, suggesting
interference in the presence of electron-phonon coupling of the surface

published surveys of star formation, structure, and gas content. After
recalibrating star formation measures, we are able to reliably measure specific
star formation rates well below the ""main sequence"" of star formation vs mass.
We find an unexpectedly large population of galaxies with star formation rates
intermediate between vigorously star-forming main sequence galaxies and passive
galaxies, and with gas content disproportionately high for their star formation
rates. Several lines of evidence suggest that these quiescent galaxies form a
distinct population rather than a low star formation tail of the main sequence.
We demonstrate that a tight main sequence, evolving with epoch, is a natural
outcome of most histories of star formation and has little astrophysical
significance, but that the quiescent population requires additional
astrophysics to explain its properties. Using a simple model for disk evolution
based on the observed dependence of star formation on gas content in local
galaxies, and assuming simple histories of cold gas inflow, we show that the
evolution of galaxies away from the main sequence can be attributed to the
depletion of gas due to star formation after a cutoff in gas inflow. The
quiescent population is composed of galaxies in which the density of disk gas
has fallen below a threshold for disk stability. The evolution of galaxies
beyond the quiescent state to gas exhaustion requires another process, probably
wind-driven mass loss. The SSFR distribution of the quiescent and passive
implies that the timescale of this process must be greater than a few Gyrs but
less than a few tens of Gyrs. The environmental dependence of the galaxy
populations is consistent with recent theory suggesting that cold gas inflows
into galaxies are truncated at earlier times in denser environments.

scales in large and weakly collisional systems by the modelling of long
reconnecting current sheets. However, this set-up neglects both the formation
of the current sheet and the coupling between the diffusion region and a larger
system that supplies the magnetic flux. Recent studies of magnetic island
merging, which naturally include these features, have found that ion kinetic
physics is crucial to describe the reconnection rate and global evolution of
such systems. In this paper, the effect of a guide field on reconnection during
island merging is considered. In contrast to the earlier current sheet studies,
we identify a limited range of guide fields for which the reconnection rate,
outflow velocity, and pile-up magnetic field increase in magnitude as the guide
field increases. The Hall-MHD fluid model is found to reproduce kinetic
reconnection rates only for a sufficiently strong guide field, for which ion
inertia breaks the frozen-in condition and the outflow becomes Alfvenic in the
kinetic system. The merging of large islands occurs on a longer timescale in
the zero guide field limit, which may in part be due to a mirror-like
instability that occurs upstream of the reconnection region.

explaining astrophysical transients with a wide range of luminosities. In this
model, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf star explodes following detonation of a
surface layer of helium. One potential signature of this explosion mechanism is
the presence of unburned helium in the outer ejecta, left over from the surface
helium layer. In this paper we present simple approximations to estimate the
optical depths of important He I lines in the ejecta of double-detonation
models. We use these approximations to compute synthetic spectra, including the
He I lines, for double-detonation models obtained from hydrodynamical explosion
simulations. Specifically, we focus on photospheric-phase predictions for the
near-infrared 10830 \AA~and 2 $\mu$m lines of He I. We first consider a double
detonation model with a luminosity corresponding roughly to normal SNe Ia. This
model has a post-explosion unburned He mass of 0.03 $M_{\odot}$ and our
calculations suggest that the 2 $\mu$m feature is expected to be very weak but
that the 10830 \AA~feature may have modest opacity in the outer ejecta.
Consequently, we suggest that a moderate-to-weak He I 10830 \AA~feature may be
expected to form in double-detonation explosions at epochs around maximum
light. However, the high velocities of unburned helium predicted by the model
($\sim 19,000$~km~s$^{-1}$) mean that the He I 10830 \AA~feature may be
confused or blended with the C I 10690~\AA~line forming at lower velocities. We
also present calculations for the He I 10830 \AA~and 2 $\mu$m lines for a lower
mass (low luminosity) double detonation model, which has a post-explosion He
mass of 0.077 $M_{\odot}$. In this case, both the He I features we consider are
strong and can provide a clear observational signature of the double-detonation
mechanism.

attractive to implement the deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) onto
embedded/portable systems. Presently, executing the software-based DCNNs
requires high-performance server clusters in practice, restricting their
widespread deployment on the mobile devices. To overcome this issue,
considerable research efforts have been conducted in the context of developing
highly-parallel and specific DCNN hardware, utilizing GPGPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs.
Stochastic Computing (SC), which uses bit-stream to represent a number within
[-1, 1] by counting the number of ones in the bit-stream, has a high potential
for implementing DCNNs with high scalability and ultra-low hardware footprint.
Since multiplications and additions can be calculated using AND gates and
multiplexers in SC, significant reductions in power/energy and hardware
footprint can be achieved compared to the conventional binary arithmetic
implementations. The tremendous savings in power (energy) and hardware
resources bring about immense design space for enhancing scalability and
robustness for hardware DCNNs. This paper presents the first comprehensive
design and optimization framework of SC-based DCNNs (SC-DCNNs). We first
present the optimal designs of function blocks that perform the basic
operations, i.e., inner product, pooling, and activation function. Then we
propose the optimal design of four types of combinations of basic function
blocks, named feature extraction blocks, which are in charge of extracting
features from input feature maps. Besides, weight storage methods are
investigated to reduce the area and power/energy consumption for storing
weights. Finally, the whole SC-DCNN implementation is optimized, with feature
extraction blocks carefully selected, to minimize area and power/energy
consumption while maintaining a high network accuracy level.

in quantum metrology and gravitational wave detection. The best way to generate
narrow-band intensity-difference squeezing is to employ
parametrically-amplified four-wave mixing process in high-gain atomic media.
Such IDS can be further enhanced by cascading multiple parametrically-amplified
four-wave mixing processes in separate atomic media. The complicated
experimental setup, added losses and required high-power pump laser with the
increase of number of stages can limit the wide uses of such scheme in
practical applications. Here, we show that by modulating the internal energy
level(s) with additional laser(s), the degree of original intensity-difference
squeezing can be substantially increased. With an initial intensity-difference
squeezing of $-8.5\pm0.4$ dB using parametrically-amplified-non-degenerate
four-wave mixing process in a three-level $\Lambda$-type configuration, the
degree of intensity-difference squeezing can be enhanced to $-11.9\pm0.4$
dB/$-13.9\pm0.4$ dB (corrected for losses) when we use one/two laser beam(s) to
modulate the involved ground/excited state(s). More importantly, a maximal
noise reduction of $-9.7\pm0.4$ dB (only corrected for electronic noise) is
observed below the standard quantum limit, which is the strongest reported to
date in phase insensitive amplification in four-wave mixing. Applying the model
to quantum metrology, the signal-to-noise ratio is improved by 23 dB compared
to the conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometer under the same phase-sensing
intensity, which is a 14-fold enhancement in rms phase measurement sensitivity
beyond the shot noise limit. Our results show a low-loss, robust and efficient

industry and academia due to its computational speed and simplicity, but
suffers from inaccuracy, in part due to the assumption of a lossless network.
Here we present a natural extension of the DC Power Flow to lossy networks. Our
approach is based on reformulating the lossy active power flow equations into a
novel fixed-point equation, and iterating this fixed-point mapping to generate
a sequence of improving estimates for the active power flow solution. Each
iteration requires the solution of a standard DC Power Flow problem with a
modified vector of power injections. The first iteration returns the standard
DC Power Flow, and one or two additional iterations yields a one or two
order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy. For radial networks, we give
explicit conditions on the power flow data which guarantee (i) that the active
power flow equations possess a unique solution, and (ii) that our iteration
converges exponentially and monotonically to this solution. For meshed
networks, we extensively test our results via standard power flow cases.

identically-prepared system replicas reach distinct states, yielding different
measures of observable quantities [14]. Here we demonstrate the RSB in the
spontaneous mode-locking regime of a conventional multimode Nd:YAG laser in a
closed cavity. The underlying mechanism is quite distinct from that of the RSB
spinglass phase in cavityless random lasers with incoherently-oscillating
modes. Here, a specific nonuniform distribution of the gain takes place in each
pulse, and frustration is induced since the coherent oscillation of a given
subset of longitudinal modes dominates and simultaneously inhibits the others.
Nevertheless, when high losses are introduced only the replica-symmetric
amplified stimulation emission is observed. We therefore suggest that the RSB
transition can be used as an identifier of the threshold in standard multimode
lasers, as recently proposed and demonstrated for random lasers [1,2].

  In natural language processing, the most widely used feature representation

relationship between the two most important models, i.e., Skip-gram and GloVe.
In our experiments, we analyze three key points in generating word embeddings,

evaluate word embeddings with three types of tasks, and we argue that they
cover the existing use of word embeddings. Through theory and practical
experiments, we present some guidelines for how to generate a good word

at the center of the optically bright inner disk. (3) A tidal stream, possibly
associated with an ongoing satellite interaction, extends from the nucleated
bulge along the disk. We interpret these properties as the results of one or
more non-disruptive mergers between NGC 5523 and companion galaxies or
satellites, raising the possibility that some galaxies become isolated because
they have merged with former companions.

states are introduced to parametrize the intrinsic excitations of the nucleon.
We show that the resonance pole positions can be related to the probability
$P_{N^*}(E)$ of finding the bare state, $N^*$, in the $\pi N$ scattering states
in infinite volume. We further demonstrate that the probability $P_{N^*}^V(E)$
of finding the same bare states in the eigenfunctions of the underlying

Our findings suggest that the comparison of $P_{N^*}(E)$ and $P_{N^*}^V(E)$ can
be used to examine whether the nucleon resonances extracted from the $\pi N$

Both
the human visual system and computer vision algorithms can use symmetry to
facilitate object recognition and other tasks. Detecting mirror symmetry in
images and data is, therefore, useful for a number of applications. Here, we
demonstrate that the problem of fitting a plane of mirror symmetry to data in
any Euclidian space can be reduced to the problem of registering two datasets.
The exactness of the resulting solution depends entirely on the registration
accuracy. This new Mirror Symmetry via Registration (MSR) framework involves
(1) data reflection with respect to an arbitrary plane, (2) registration of
original and reflected datasets, and (3) calculation of the eigenvector of
eigenvalue -1 for the transformation matrix representing the reflection and
registration mappings. To support MSR, we also introduce a novel 2D
registration method based on random sample consensus of an ensemble of
normalized cross-correlation matches. With this as its registration back-end,
MSR achieves state-of-the-art performance for symmetry line detection in two
independent 2D testing databases. We further demonstrate the generality of MSR
by testing it on a database of 3D shapes with an iterative closest point
registration back-end. Finally, we explore its applicability to examining
symmetry in natural systems by assessing the degree of symmetry present in
myelinated axon reconstructions from a larval zebrafish.

Ontology (NCBO) released the Ontology Recommender, which is a service that
receives a biomedical text corpus or a list of keywords and suggests ontologies
appropriate for referencing the indicated terms. We developed a new version of
the NCBO Ontology Recommender. Called Ontology Recommender 2.0, it uses a new
recommendation approach that evaluates the relevance of an ontology to
biomedical text data according to four criteria: (1) the extent to which the
ontology covers the input data; (2) the acceptance of the ontology in the
biomedical community; (3) the level of detail of the ontology classes that
cover the input data; and (4) the specialization of the ontology to the domain
of the input data. Our evaluation shows that the enhanced recommender provides
higher quality suggestions than the original approach, providing better
coverage of the input data, more detailed information about their concepts,
increased specialization for the domain of the input data, and greater
acceptance and use in the community. In addition, it provides users with more
explanatory information, along with suggestions of not only individual
ontologies but also groups of ontologies. It also can be customized to fit the
needs of different scenarios. Ontology Recommender 2.0 combines the strengths

advantages over BP-based methods, including convergence guarantees and better
error-rate performance in high-reliability channels. The latter makes LP
decoding attractive for optical transport and storage applications. However, LP
decoding, when implemented with general solvers, does not scale to large

It has been recently shown that the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers

enough with phonons to form polarons. A polarons sluggish motion is linked to
slowly shifting atomic displacements that severely reduce the intrinsic width
of its transport band. Here a means to estimate hopping polarons bandwidths
from Seebeck-coefficient measurements is described. The magnitudes of
semiconductors Seebeck coefficients are usually quite large (greater than 86
microvolts/K) near room temperature. However, in accord with the third law of
thermodynamics, Seebeck coefficients must vanish at absolute zero. Here the
transition of the Seebeck coefficient of hopping polarons to its
low-temperature regime is investigated. The temperature and sharpness of this
transition depends on the concentration of carriers and on the width of their
transport band. This feature provides a means of estimating the width of a
polarons transport band. Since the intrinsic broadening of polaron bands is
very small, less than the characteristic phonon energy, the net widths of
polaron transport bands in disordered semiconductors approach the energetic
disorder experienced by their hopping carriers, their disorder energy.

five sources with a resolution of about eight milliarcseconds and detected all
of them with a confidence level above 5{\sigma} at 1.4 GHz. They show compact
structure and brightness temperatures above $10^7$ K, which implies that the
radio emission is non-thermal. We rule out ongoing nuclear star formation and
conclude that these VLBI-detected radio sources are parsec-scale jet activity
associated with the supermassive black holes in low luminosity active galactic
nuclei (LLAGNs), although there are no clear signs of nuclear activity observed

  $k$-Subgraph","15 pages",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the Densest $k$-Subgraph problem, given an undirected graph $G$ and an
integer $k$, the goal is to find a subgraph of $G$ on $k$ vertices that
contains maximum number of edges. Even though the state-of-the-art algorithm
for the problem achieves only $O(n^{1/4 + \varepsilon})$ approximation ratio
(Bhaskara et al., 2010), previous attempts at proving hardness of
approximation, including those under average case assumptions, fail to achieve
a polynomial ratio; the best ratios ruled out under any worst case assumption
and any average case assumption are only any constant (Raghavendra and Steurer,
2010) and $2^{\Omega(\log^{2/3} n)}$ (Alon et al., 2011) respectively.
  In this work, we show, assuming the exponential time hypothesis (ETH), that
there is no polynomial-time algorithm that approximates Densest $k$-Subgraph to
within $n^{1/(\log \log n)^c}$ factor of the optimum, where $c > 0$ is a
universal constant independent of $n$. In addition, our result has ""perfect
completeness"", meaning that we prove that it is ETH-hard to even distinguish
between the case in which $G$ contains a $k$-clique and the case in which every
induced $k$-subgraph of $G$ has density at most $1/n^{-1/(\log \log n)^c}$ in
polynomial time.
  Moreover, if we make a stronger assumption that there is some constant
$\varepsilon > 0$ such that no subexponential-time algorithm can distinguish
between a satisfiable 3SAT formula and one which is only $(1 -
\varepsilon)$-satisfiable (also known as Gap-ETH), then the ratio above can be
improved to $n^{f(n)}$ for any function $f$ whose limit is zero as $n$ goes to
infinity (i.e. $f \in o(1)$).

energy-efficient transfer of information and energy over the same wireless
channel, for which the physical layer will become more vulnerable to cyber
attacks by potential multi-antenna eavesdroppers. To address this issue, this
paper considers transmit time-switching (TS) mode, in which energy and
information signals are transmitted separately in time by the BS. This protocol
is not only easy to implement but also delivers the opportunity of
multi-purpose beamforming, in which energy beamformers during wireless power
transfer are useful in jamming the eavesdropper. In the presence of imperfect
channel estimation and multi-antenna eavesdroppers, the energy and information
beamformers and the transmit TS ratio are jointly optimized to maximize the
worst-case user secrecy rate subject to UEs' harvested energy thresholds and a
BS transmit power budget. New robust path-following algorithms, which involve
one simple convex quadratic program at each iteration are proposed for
computational solutions of this difficult optimization problem and also the
problem of secure energy efficiency maximization. The latter is further complex
due to additional optimization variables appearing in the denominator of the
secrecy rate function. Numerical results confirm that the performance of the
proposed computational solutions is robust against the channel uncertainties.

coding cycles interleaved with testing. The developer first writes a unit test
for the desired functionality, followed by the necessary production code, and
refactors the code. Many empirical studies neglect unique process
characteristics related to TDD iterative nature. Aim: We formulate four process
characteristic: sequencing, granularity, uniformity, and refactoring effort. We
investigate how these characteristics impact quality and productivity in TDD
and related variations. Method: We analyzed 82 data points collected from 39
professionals, each capturing the process used while performing a specific
development task. We built regression models to assess the impact of process
characteristics on quality and productivity. Quality was measured by functional
correctness. Result: Quality and productivity improvements were primarily
positively associated with the granularity and uniformity. Sequencing, the
order in which test and production code are written, had no important
influence. Refactoring effort was negatively associated with both outcomes. We
explain the unexpected negative correlation with quality by possible prevalence
of mixed refactoring. Conclusion: The claimed benefits of TDD may not be due to
its distinctive test-first dynamic, but rather due to the fact that TDD-like
processes encourage fine-grained, steady steps that improve focus and flow.

approximation within factor $O_d((n/q)^{d/2-1})$ for arbitrary polynomials,
$O_d((n/q)^{d/4-1/2})$ for polynomials with non-negative coefficients, and
$O_d(\sqrt{m/q})$ for sparse polynomials with $m$ monomials. The approximation

polynomials. This enables us to harness the benefits of higher level SoS
relaxations.
  We complement our algorithmic results with some polynomially large
integrality gaps, albeit for a slightly weaker (but still very natural)

transmission problem in a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with a thin and
periodic layer of finite length. The layer may consists of a periodic
pertubation of the material coefficients or it is a wall modelled by boundary
conditions with an periodic array of small perforations. We consider the
periodicity in the layer as the small variable $\delta$ and the thickness of
the layer to be at the same order. Moreover we assume the thin layer to
terminate at re-entrant corners leading to a singular behaviour in the
asymptotic expansion of the solution representation. This singular behaviour
becomes visible in the asymptotic expansion in powers of $\delta$ where the
powers depend on the opening angle. We construct the asymptotic expansion order
by order. It consists of a macroscopic representation away from the layer, a
boundary layer corrector in the vicinity of the layer, and a near field
corrector in the vicinity of the end-points. The boundary layer correctors and
the near field correctors are obtained by the solution of canonical problems
based, respectively, on the method of periodic surface homogenization and on
the method of matched asymptotic expansions. This will lead to transmission
conditions for the macroscopic part of the solution on an infinitely thin
interface and corner conditions to fix the unbounded singular behaviour at its
end-points. Finally, theoretical justifications of the second order expansion
are given and illustrated by numerical experiments. The solution representation
introduced in this article can be used to compute a highly accurate
approximation of the solution with a computational effort independent of the
small periodicity $\delta$.

promising technique for realizing cost-effective 5G wireless systems with large
MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) but only limited radio frequency (RF)
chains. This paper studies an uplink multi-user mmWave single-sided lens MIMO
system, where only the base station (BS) is equipped with a full-dimensional
(FD) lens antenna array with both elevation and azimuth angle resolution
capabilities, and each mobile station (MS) employs the conventional uniform
planar array (UPA) without the lens. By exploiting the angle-dependent energy
focusing property of the lens antenna array at the BS as well as the multi-path
sparsity of mmWave channels, we propose a low-complexity path division multiple
access (PDMA) scheme, which enables virtually interference-free multi-user
communications when the angle of arrivals (AoAs) of all MS multi-path signals
are sufficiently separable at the BS. To this end, a new technique called path
delay compensation is proposed at the BS to effectively transform the
multi-user frequency-selective MIMO channels to parallel frequency-flat
small-size MIMO channels for different MSs, for each of which the
low-complexity single-carrier(SC) transmission is applied. For general
scenarios with insufficient AoA separations, analog beamforming at the MSs and
digital combining at the BS are jointly designed to maximize the achievable
sum-rate of the MSs based on their effective MIMO channels resulting from path
delay compensation. In addition, we propose a new and efficient channel
estimation scheme tailored for PDMA, which requires negligible training
overhead in practical mmWave systems and yet leads to comparable performance as
that based on perfect channel state information (CSI).

top-down Bayesian formulation that seamlessly integrates state estimation,
track management, clutter rejection, occlusion and mis-detection handling into
a single recursion. This is achieved by modeling the multi-object state as
labeled random finite set and using the Bayes recursion to propagate the
multi-object filtering density forward in time. The proposed filter updates
tracks with detections but switches to image data when mis-detection occurs,
thereby exploiting the efficiency of detection data and the accuracy of image
data. Furthermore the labeled random finite set framework enables the
incorporation of prior knowledge that mis-detections of long tracks which occur
in the middle of the scene are likely to be due to occlusions. Such prior
knowledge can be exploited to improve occlusion handling, especially long
occlusions that can lead to premature track termination in on-line multi-object
tracking. Tracking performance are compared to state-of-the-art algorithms on
well-known benchmark video datasets.

problems, with image classification and object detection as the prominent
examples. In spite of these practical successes, optimization of deep networks
remains an active topic in deep learning research. In this work, we focus on
investigation of the network solution properties that can potentially lead to
good performance. Our research is inspired by theoretical and empirical results
that use orthogonal matrices to initialize networks, but we are interested in
investigating how orthogonal weight matrices perform when network training
converges. To this end, we propose to constrain the solutions of weight
matrices in the orthogonal feasible set during the whole process of network
training, and achieve this by a simple yet effective method called Singular
Value Bounding (SVB). In SVB, all singular values of each weight matrix are
simply bounded in a narrow band around the value of 1. Based on the same
motivation, we also propose Bounded Batch Normalization (BBN), which improves
Batch Normalization by removing its potential risk of ill-conditioned layer
transform. We present both theoretical and empirical results to justify our
proposed methods. Experiments on benchmark image classification datasets show
the efficacy of our proposed SVB and BBN. In particular, we achieve the
state-of-the-art results of 3.06% error rate on CIFAR10 and 16.90% on CIFAR100,
using off-the-shelf network architectures (Wide ResNets). Our preliminary
results on ImageNet also show the promise in large-scale learning.

modeling, e.g., localized contamination), and shifts of the steady state under

  Journal",,"10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/203",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an analysis of Mg II $\lambda2798$ and Fe II UV emission lines for
archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars to explore diagnostics of the
magnesium-to-iron abundance ratio in a broad-line region cloud. Our sample
consists of 17,432 quasars selected from the SDSS Data Release 7 with a
redshift range of $0.72 < z < 1.63$. A strong anticorrelation between Mg II
equivalent width (EW) and the Eddington ratio is found, while only a weak
positive correlation is found between Fe II EW and the Eddington ratio. To
investigate the origin of these differing behaviors of Mg II and Fe II emission
lines, we have performed photoionization calculations using the Cloudy code,
where constraints from recent reverberation mapping studies are considered. We
find from calculations that (i) Mg II and Fe II emission lines are created at
different regions in a photoionized cloud, and (ii) their EW correlations with
the Eddington ratio can be explained by just changing the cloud gas density.
These results indicate that the Mg II/Fe II flux ratio, which has been used as
a first-order proxy for the Mg/Fe abundance ratio in chemical evolution studies
with quasar emission lines, depends largely on the cloud gas density. By
correcting this density dependence, we propose new diagnostics of the Mg/Fe
abundance ratio for a broad line region cloud. Comparing the derived Mg/Fe
abundance ratios with chemical evolution models, we suggest that
$\alpha$-enrichment by mass loss from metal-poor intermediate-mass stars
occurred at $z\sim2$ or earlier.

to extrapolate to future devices. Measurements during start-up experiments have
shown how the bulk ion temperature rise scales with the square of the
reconnecting field. During the current ramp up models are not able to correctly
predict the current diffusion. Experiments have been performed looking at edge
and core turbulence. At the edge detailed studies have revealed how filament
characteristic are responsible for determining the near and far SOL density
profiles. In the core the intrinsic rotation and electron scale turbulence have
been measured. The role that the fast ion gradient has on redistributing fast
ions through fishbone modes has led to a redesign of the neutral beam injector
on MAST Upgrade. In H-mode the turbulence at the pedestal top has been shown to
be consistent with being due to electron temperature gradient modes. A
reconnection process appears to occur during ELMs and the number of filaments
released determines the power profile at the divertor. Resonant magnetic
perturbations can mitigate ELMs provided the edge peeling response is maximised
and the core kink response minimised. The mitigation of intrinsic error fields
with toroidal mode number n>1 has been shown to be important for plasma
performance.

symmetric decay of entanglement, non-locality and discord. Our results show
that the symmetric decay of quantum correlations is not directly linked to the
presence or absence of symmetry in the initial state, while it does depend on
the type of correlation considered as well as on the type noise. We prove that
asymmetric decay can be used to infer, in certain cases, characteristic
properties of the channel. We also show that the location of noise may lead to
dramatic changes in the persistence of phenomena such as entanglement sudden
death and time-invariant discord.

structures and dynamics of their social arrangements. In order to analyze the
gender preferences of individuals in interaction with others at different
stages of their lives we study a large mobile phone dataset. To do this we
consider four fundamental gender-related caller and callee combinations of
human interactions, namely male to male, male to female, female to male, and
female to female, which together with age, kinship, and different levels of
friendship give rise to a wide scope of human sociality. Here we analyse the
relative strength of these four types of interaction using a large dataset of
mobile phone communication records. Our analysis suggests strong age dependence
for an ego of one gender choosing to call an individual of either gender. We
observe a strong opposite sex bonding across most of their reproductive age.
However, older women show a strong tendency to connect to another female that
is one generation younger in a way that is suggestive of the
\emph{grandmothering effect}. We also find that the relative strength among the
four possible interactions depends on phone call duration. For calls of medium
and long duration, opposite gender interactions are significantly more probable
than same gender interactions during the reproductive years, suggesting
potential emotional exchange between spouses. By measuring the fraction of
calls to other generations we find that mothers tend to make calls more to
their daughters than to their sons, whereas fathers make calls more to their
sons than to their daughters. For younger people, most of their calls go to
same generation alters, while older people call the younger people more
frequently, which supports the suggestion that \emph{affection flows downward}.

cells to their environment. After chemical, the next most important cue is
mechanical, and protein complexes that produce or enable a chemical signal in
response to a mechanical stimulus are called mechanosensors. There is a sharp
distinction between sensing an external force or pressure/tension applied to
the cell, and sensing the mechanical stiffness of the environment. We call the
first mechanosensitivity of the 1st kind, and the latter mechanosensitivity of
the 2nd kind. There are two variants of protein complexes that act as
mechanosensors of the 2nd kind: producing either a one-off or a reversible
action. The latent complex of TGF-$\beta$ is an example of the one-off action:
on the release of active TGF-$\beta$ signal, the complex is discarded and needs
to be replaced. In contrast, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in a complex with
integrin is a reversible mechanosensor, which initiates the chemical signal in
its active phosphorylated conformation, but can spontaneously return to its
closed folded conformation. Here we study the physical mechanism of the
reversible mechanosensor of the 2nd kind, using FAK as a practical example. We
find how the rates of conformation changes depend on the substrate stiffness
and the pulling force applied from the cell cytoskeleton. The results compare
well with the phenotype observations of cells on different substrates.

two compact binaries with very similar orbital parameters. The latter has been
observed to evolve on a very short timescale of ~70 Myr which is more than an
order of magnitude shorter than expected. There is an ongoing debate on the
possibility that the pulsar spin-down power ablates the companion generating
large amount of mass-loss in the system. It is interesting therefore to study
whether IGR J00291+5934 does show a similar behaviour as its twin system SAX
J1808.4-3658. In this work we present the first measurement of the orbital
period derivative of IGR J00291+5934. By using XMM-Newton data recorded during
the 2015 outburst and adding the previous results of the 2004 and 2008
outbursts, we are able to measure a 90% confidence level upper limit for the
orbital period derivative of -5x10^-13<Pb_dot<6x10^-13. This implies that the
binary is evolving on a timescale longer than ~0.5 Gyr, which is compatible
with the expected timescale of mass transfer driven by angular momentum loss
via gravitational radiation. We discuss the scenario in which the power loss
from magnetic dipole radiation of the neutron star is hitting the companion
star. If this model is applied to SAX J1808.4-3658 then the difference in
orbital behavior can be ascribed to a different efficiency for the conversion
of the spin-down power into energetic relativistic pulsar wind and
X-ray/gamma-ray radiation for the two pulsars, with IGR J00291+5934 requiring
an extraordinarily low efficiency of less than 5% to explain the observations.
Alternatively, the donor in IGR J00291+5934 is weakly/not magnetized which
would suppress the possibility of generating mass-quadrupole variations.

phase-resolved polarization angle. It is shown that contrary to the rotating
vector model, for an off-centred dipole, the polarization angle also depends on
the emission altitude. Although the fitting parameter space increases from two
to six (position of the dipole, altitude and shift of the zero phase),
statistical analysis should remain tractable. Observations revealing an

picoseconds for superconductors with $C_e/C_{ph}|_{T_c}\gg 1$ and small

probe the evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) in high-redshift Universe
($z \leq 6$). One of the biggest observational challenges is to remove the
foreground spectrum which is at least four orders of magnitude brighter than
the cosmological 21-cm emission. Conventional global 21-cm experiments rely on
the spectral smoothness of the foreground synchrotron emission to separate it
from the unique 21-cm spectral structures in a single total-power spectrum.
However, frequency-dependent instrumental and observational effects are known
to corrupt such smoothness and complicates the foreground subtraction. We
introduce a polarimetric approach to measure the projection-induced
polarization of the anisotropic foreground onto a stationary dual-polarized
antenna. Due to Earth rotation, when pointing the antenna at a celestial pole,
the revolving foreground will modulate this polarization with a unique
frequency-dependent sinusoidal signature as a function of time. In our
simulations, by harmonic decomposing this dynamic polarization, our technique
produces two separate spectra in parallel from the same observation: (i) a
total sky power consisting both the foreground and the 21-cm background, (ii) a
model-independent measurement of the foreground spectrum at a harmonic
consistent to twice the sky rotation rate. In the absence of any instrumental
effects, by scaling and subtracting the latter from the former, we recover the
injected global 21-cm model within assumed uncertainty. We further discuss
several limiting factors and potential remedies for future implementation.

a total of 161 clusters containing nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs),
with the potential to synthesize at least 11 novel products. Most of them are
siderophores or lipopeptides, two classes of products with potential
application in biocontrol. The strategy led to the identification, for the
first time, of the cluster for cepaciachelin biosynthesis in the genome of
Burkholderia ambifaria AMMD and a cluster corresponding to a new
malleobactin-like siderophore, called phymabactin, was identified in
Burkholderia phymatum STM815 genome. In both cases, the siderophore was
produced when the strain was grown in iron-limited conditions. Elsewhere, the
cluster for the antifungal burkholdin was detected in the genome of B.
ambifaria AMMD and also Burkholderia sp. KJ006. Burkholderia pseudomallei
strains harbor the genetic potential to produce a novel lipopeptide called
burkhomycin, containing a peptidyl moiety of 12 monomers. A mixture of
lipopeptides produced by Burkholderia rhizoxinica lowered the surface tension
of the supernatant from 70 to 27 mN/m. The production of nonribosomal secondary
metabolites seems related to the three phylogenetic groups obtained from 16S
rRNA sequences. Moreover, the genome-mining approach gave new insights into the
nonribosomal synthesis exemplified by the identification of dual C/E domains in
lipopeptide NRPSs, up to now essentially found in Pseudomonas strains.

increase sample sizes to compensate for this complexity, at the cost of

feasibility of inter-site classification of neuropsychiatric status, with an
application to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database, a large

that extract the most predictive biomarkers from the data. These R-fMRI
pipelines build participant-specific connectomes from functionally-defined
brain areas. Connectomes are then compared across participants to learn
patterns of connectivity that differentiate typical controls from individuals
with autism. We predict this neuropsychiatric status for participants from the
same acquisition sites or different, unseen, ones. Good choices of methods for
the various steps of the pipeline lead to 67% prediction accuracy on the full
ABIDE data, which is significantly better than previously reported results. We
perform extensive validation on multiple subsets of the data defined by
different inclusion criteria. These enables detailed analysis of the factors
contributing to successful connectome-based prediction. First, prediction
accuracy improves as we include more subjects, up to the maximum amount of
subjects available. Second, the definition of functional brain areas is of
paramount importance for biomarker discovery: brain areas extracted from large
R-fMRI datasets outperform reference atlases in the classification tasks.

that is required for creating most types of knots. To perform this action, we
need to pass the end of the rope through an area that is enclosed by another
segment of rope. As for all knotting actions, the robot must for this exercise
control over a semi-compliant and flexible body whose complex 3d shape is
difficult to perceive and follow. Additionally, the target loop often deforms
during the insertion. We address this problem by defining a virtual magnetic
field through the loop's interior and use the Biot Savart law to guide the
robotic manipulator that holds the end of the rope. This approach directly
defines, for any manipulator position, a motion vector that results in a path
that passes through the loop. The motion vector is directly derived from the
position of the loop and changes as soon as it moves or deforms. In simulation,
we test the insertion action against dynamic loop deformation of different
intensity. We also combine insertion with grasp and release actions,
coordinated by a hybrid control system, to tie knots in simulation and with a

of disordered proteins, taking the human proteome as a case study. The focus is
on a distinction between mostly unstructured proteins and proteins which
contain long unstructured regions accommodated in an overall folded structure.
In particular we distinguish: i) Not disordered proteins (NDPs), that either
have all their residues ordered or do not have disordered segments longer than
30 residues nor more than 30% of disordered residues; ii) Proteins with
intrinsically disordered regions (IDRPs), that have at least one disordered
domain longer than 30 residues, but disordered in less than 30% of their
residues; iii) Proteins that are intrinsically disordered (IDPs), that have
both at least one disordered segment longer than 30 residues and that are
disordered on more than 30% of their residues; iv) Proteins with fragmented
disorder (FRAG_IDPs), that do not have a disordered fragment longer than 30
residues but that, nevertheless, have at least 30% or more of their residues
predicted as disordered. The potential use of these variants is checked over
several groups of disease-related proteins. Our main conclusions point out that
IDRPs are more similar to NDPs than to IDPs. IDRPs and NDPs have a similar
functional repertoire and probably share a lock-and-key mechanism of
interaction with substrates. IDRPs and IDPs are differently present among human
disease-related proteins. IDRPs probably do not play a specific role in the
development of complex diseases, since their frequency is similar in
disease-related proteins and in the entire human proteome. IDPs can play a role
in the emergence of cancer, neurodegenerative, thyroid and liver disease.

Packet Classification Engine (PCE). This engine is used in FPGA-based firewall.
Our PCE inspects multi-dimensional field of packet header sequentially based on
tree-based algorithm. This algorithm simplifies overall system to a lower scale
and leads to a more secure system. The PCE works with an adaptation of single
cycle processor architecture in the system. Ethernet packet is examined with
PCE based on Source IP Address, Destination IP Address, Source Port,
Destination Port, and Protocol fields of the packet header. These are basic
fields to know whether it is a dangerous or normal packet before inspecting the
content. Using implementation of tree-based algorithm in the architecture,
firewall rules are rebuilt into 24-bit sub-rules which are read as processor
instruction in the inspection process. The inspection process is comparing one
sub-rule with input field of header every clock cycle. The proposed PCE shows
91 MHz clock frequency in Cyclone II EP2C70F896C6 with 13 clocks throughput
average from input to output generation. The use of tree-based algorithm
simplifies the multidimensional packet inspection and gives us reconfigurable
as well as scalable system. The architecture is fast, reliable, and adaptable
and also can maximize the advantages of the algorithm very well. Although the
PCE has high frequency and little amount of clock, filtering speed of a
firewall also depends on the other components, such as packet FIFO buffer. Fast

is afforded to the other less explored class of low-rank GP approximations that
exploit the sparse spectral representation of a GP kernel. This paper presents
such an effort to advance the state of the art of sparse spectrum GP models to
achieve competitive predictive performance for massive datasets. Our
generalized framework of stochastic variational Bayesian sparse spectrum GP
(sVBSSGP) models addresses their shortcomings by adopting a Bayesian treatment
of the spectral frequencies to avoid overfitting, modeling these frequencies
jointly in its variational distribution to enable their interaction a
posteriori, and exploiting local data for boosting the predictive performance.
However, such structural improvements result in a variational lower bound that
is intractable to be optimized. To resolve this, we exploit a variational
parameterization trick to make it amenable to stochastic optimization.
Interestingly, the resulting stochastic gradient has a linearly decomposable
structure that can be exploited to refine our stochastic optimization method to
incur constant time per iteration while preserving its property of being an
unbiased estimator of the exact gradient of the variational lower bound.
Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets shows that sVBSSGP outperforms
state-of-the-art stochastic implementations of sparse GP models.

power-density spectra of several accreting low-mass neutron star (NS) binaries.
In our previous work we have considered several QPO models. We have identified
and explored mass-angular-momentum relations implied by individual QPO models
for the atoll source 4U 1636-53. In this paper we extend our study and confront
QPO models with various NS equations of state (EoS). We start with simplified
calculations assuming Kerr background geometry and then present results of
detailed calculations considering the influence of NS quadrupole moment
(related to rotationally induced NS oblateness) assuming Hartle-Thorne
spacetimes. We show that the application of concrete EoS together with a
particular QPO model yields a specific mass-angular-momentum relation. However,
we demonstrate that the degeneracy in mass and angular momentum can be removed
when the NS spin frequency inferred from the X-ray burst observations is
considered. We inspect a large set of EoS and discuss their compatibility with
the considered QPO models. We conclude that when the NS spin frequency in 4U
1636-53 is close to 580Hz we can exclude 51 from 90 of the considered
combinations of EoS and QPO models. We also discuss additional restrictions
that may exclude even more combinations. Namely, there are 13 EOS compatible
with the observed twin peak QPOs and the relativistic precession model.
However, when considering the low frequency QPOs and Lense-Thirring precession,
only 5 EOS are compatible with the model.

NGC4258, detached eclipsing binary distances to LMC and M31, and MW Cepheids

We find that part of the R11 data is down-weighted by the HPs but that R16 is
mostly consistent with expectations for a Gaussian distribution, meaning that
there is no need to down-weight the R16 data set. For R16, we find a value of
$H_0 = 73.75 \pm 2.11 \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$

the Planck 2015 value of $H_0 = 67.81 \pm 0.92 \,\mathrm{km}\, \mathrm{s}^{-1}

the choice of anchor distances affects the final value significantly. If we
exclude the Milky Way from the anchors, then the value of $H_0$ decreases. We
find however no evident reason to exclude the MW data. The HP method used here
avoids subjective rejection criteria for outliers and offers a way to test

proceedings contribution this topic is explored for the linearly polarized
gluons inside unpolarized hadrons and unpolarized gluons inside transversely
polarized hadrons. It is argued that $\chi_{b0/2}$ and $\eta_b$ production at
LHC are best to study the effects of linearly polarized gluons in hadronic
collisions, by means of angular independent ratios of ratios of cross sections.
This can be directly compared to $\cos 2\phi$ asymmetries in heavy quark pair
and dijet production in DIS at a future high-energy Electron-Ion Collider
(EIC), which probe the same TMDs. In the small-$x$ limit this corresponds to
the Weizs\""acker-Williams (WW) gluon distributions, which should show a change
in behavior for transverse momenta around the saturation scale. Together with
investigations of the dipole (DP) gluon distributions, this can provide
valuable information about the polarization of the Color Glass Condensate if
sufficiently small $x$ are reached. Quarkonia can also be useful in the study
of single transverse spin asymmetries. For transversely polarized hadrons the
gluon distribution can be asymmetric, which is referred to as the Sivers
effect. It leads to single spin asymmetries in for instance $J/\psi$ (pair)
production at AFTER@LHC, which probe the WW or $f$-type gluon Sivers TMD. It
allows for a test of a sign-change relation w.r.t. the gluon Sivers TMD probed
at an EIC in open heavy quark pair production. Single spin asymmetries in
backward inclusive $C$-odd quarkonium production, such as $J/\psi$ production,
may offer probes of the DP or $d$-type gluon Sivers TMD at small $x$-values in
the polarized proton, which in that limit corresponds to a correlator of a
single Wilson loop, describing the spin-dependent odderon.

Young^,s modulus (E). Whereas LTSH and \chi_exp were measured for the as-cast

short anneal close to the glass transition temperature). The LTSH showed that
the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, N_0(E_F), decreases with
increasing x, whereas the Debye temperature (\theta_D) increases with x. This
is similar to what is observed in binary and ternary amorphous alloys of early
transition metals (TE) with late transition metals (TL) and indicates that
N_0(E_F) is dominated by the d-electrons of the TE. The LTSH also showed the
absence of superconductivity down to 1.8K and indicated the emergence of the
Boson peak above 4K in all alloys.The free-electron like paramagnetic

increases with x, indicating enhanced interatomic bonding on addition of Ni.

while in two dimensions it measures the itinerant-circulation correlation
between Wannier states. The correlation function is nonzero in both the

correlation length that diverges at topological phase transitions. The
correlation length and the curvature function that defines the topological

universality class is determined by the orbital symmetry of the Dirac model.

lower boundary splits into multiple secondary wavepackets. A portion of the
packet refracts towards the null due to the varying Alfv\'en speed. Waves
incident on the equipartition contour surrounding the null, where the sound and
Alfv\'en speeds coincide, partially transmit, reflect, and mode convert between
branches of the local dispersion relation. Approximately $15.5\%$ of the
wavepacket's initial energy ($E_{input}$) converges on the null, mostly as a
fast magnetoacoustic wave. Conversion is very efficient: $70\%$ of the energy
incident on the null is converted to slow modes propagating away from the null,
$7\%$ leaves as a fast wave, and the remaining $23\%$ (0.036$E_{input}$) is
locally dissipated. The acoustic energy leaving the null is strongly
concentrated along field lines near each of the null's four separatrices. The
portion of the wavepacket that refracts towards the null, and the amount of
current accumulation, depends on the vertical and horizontal wavenumbers and
the centroid position of the wavepacket as it crosses the photosphere. Regions
that refract towards or away from the null do not simply coincide with regions
of open versus closed magnetic field or the local field orientation. We also
modeled wavepacket propagation using a WKB method and found that it agrees

in different conditions (applied magnetic field and temperatures) enable to
complete the film characterization. The obtained results suggest that the ion
bombardment produces regions where the local mechanical constraints are
significantly different from the average, promoting the local presence of
magneto-structural phases far from the equilibrium. These regions could be
responsible for the thermal hysteresis suppression previously reported,
irradiation-induced defects acting as seeds in the phase transition.

2.5$^{\textrm{o}}$ Off-Axis Angles (OAAs), and the second one possibly in Korea

areas of neutrino oscillation physics mainly due to longer baselines. There are
several candidate sites in Korea with baselines of 1,000$\sim$1,300~km and OAAs
of 1$^{\textrm{o}}$$\sim$3$^{\textrm{o}}$. We conducted sensitivity studies on
neutrino oscillation physics for a second detector, either in Japan (JD
$\times$ 2) or Korea (JD + KD) and compared the results with a single detector
in Japan. Leptonic CP violation sensitivity is improved especially when the CP
is non-maximally violated. The larger matter effect at Korean candidate sites
significantly enhances sensitivities to non-standard interactions of neutrinos
and mass ordering determination. Current studies indicate the best sensitivity
is obtained at Mt. Bisul (1,088~km baseline, $1.3^\circ$ OAA). Thanks to a
larger (1,000~m) overburden than the first detector site, clear improvements to
sensitivities for solar and supernova relic neutrino searches are expected.

study white L\'evy noise where the constant speed and the angular noise
generate a persistent motion characterized by the persistence time $\tau_D$. At
this time scale the crossover from ballistic to normal diffusive behavior is
observed. The corresponding diffusion coefficient can be obtained analytically
for the whole class of symmetric $\alpha$-stable noises. As typical for models
with noise-driven angular dynamics, the diffusion coefficient depends
non-monotonously on the angular noise intensity. As second example, we study
angular noise as described by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with correlation
time $\tau_c$ driven by the Cauchy white noise. We discuss the asymptotic
diffusive properties of this model and obtain the same analytical expression
for the diffusion coefficient as in the first case which is thus independent on
$\tau_c$. Remarkably, for $\tau_c>\tau_D$ the crossover from a non-Gaussian to
a Gaussian distribution of displacements takes place at a time $\tau_G$ which
can be considerably larger than the persistence time $\tau_D$.

of a pseudo-magnetic field as a result of mechanical deformation. In the case
of graphene, the Landau quantization resulting from this pseudo-magnetic field
has been measured using scanning tunneling microscopy. Here we show that a
signature of the pseudo-magnetic field is a local sublattice symmetry breaking
observable as a redistribution of the local density of states. This can be
interpreted as a polarization of graphene's pseudospin due to a strain induced
pseudo-magnetic field, in analogy to the alignment of a real spin in a magnetic
field. We reveal this sublattice symmetry breaking by tunably straining
graphene using the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope. The tip locally
lifts the graphene membrane from a SiO$_2$ support, as visible by an increased
slope of the $I(z)$ curves. The amount of lifting is consistent with molecular
dynamics calculations, which reveal a deformed graphene area under the tip in
the shape of a Gaussian. The pseudo-magnetic field induced by the deformation
becomes visible as a sublattice symmetry breaking which scales with the lifting
height of the strained deformation and therefore with the pseudo-magnetic field
strength. Its magnitude is quantitatively reproduced by analytic and
tight-binding models, revealing fields of 1000 T. These results might be the
starting point for an effective THz valley filter, as a basic element of
valleytronics.

to derive generalized TBA equations, which follow from the fusion hierarchy of
the appropriate QTM's. Our formulas are valid for arbitrary imaginary time and
for real times at least up to a time $t_0$, after which the integral equations

infinite, allowing to explore in detail the post-quench dynamics of the system.

imaginary time results can be recovered by means of the quench action approach,
unveiling a direct connection with the quantum transfer matrix formalism. In

generate PBHs from large primordial density perturbations. In this paper, we
discuss the possibility to interpret the observed GW events as mergers of PBHs

should be large enough to produce a sizable amount of PBHs and thus we have
several other probes to test this scenario. We point out that the current
pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments already put severe constraints on GWs
generated via the second-order effects, and that the observation of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) puts severe restriction on its $\mu$ distortion. In
particular, it is found that the scalar power spectrum should have a very sharp
peak at $k \sim 10^{6}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ to fulfill the required abundance of PBHs
while evading constraints from the PTA experiments together with the $\mu$
distortion. We propose a mechanism which can realize such a sharp peak. In the
future, simple inflation models that generate PBHs via almost Gaussian
fluctuations could be probed/excluded.

complex regularities in data. Gaussian processes are successfully used for
classification/regression problems and dimensionality reduction. In this work
we consider the classification problem only. The complexity of standard methods
for GP-classification scales cubically with the size of the training dataset.
This complexity makes them inapplicable to big data problems. Therefore, a
variety of methods were introduced to overcome this limitation. In the paper we
focus on methods based on so called inducing inputs. This approach is based on
variational inference and proposes a particular lower bound for marginal
likelihood (evidence). This bound is then maximized w.r.t. parameters of kernel
function of the Gaussian process, thus fitting the model to data. The
computational complexity of this method is $O(nm^2)$, where $m$ is the number
of inducing inputs used by the model and is assumed to be substantially smaller
than the size of the dataset $n$. Recently, a new evidence lower bound for
GP-classification problem was introduced. It allows using stochastic
optimization, which makes it suitable for big data problems. However, the new
lower bound depends on $O(m^2)$ variational parameter, which makes optimization
challenging in case of big m. In this work we develop a new approach for
training inducing input GP models for classification problems. Here we use
quadratic approximation of several terms in the aforementioned evidence lower
bound, obtaining analytical expressions for optimal values of most of the
parameters in the optimization, thus sufficiently reducing the dimension of
optimization space. In our experiments we achieve as well or better results,

opening or closing the energy gap between conduction and valence bands, a key

containing addition and multiplication called an S-Extension of a Field. This
unique structure extends a Field so that the equation $0\cdot s=x$ has exactly
one solution for every non-zero Field element $x$. Furthermore, a different
solution is obtained for each choice of $x$, making this solution unique to
that particular equation. However, the equation $0\cdot s=0$ has two or more
solutions, with no preference towards any one particular solution. This allows
us to use the usual definition of division as the solution to the equation
$0\cdot s=x$ to evaluate $x$ divided by $0$. And if $x\not=0$, every ${x\over
0}$ is a unique element that is also unique to that particular $x$ while
${0\over 0}$ remains indeterminate. This creates a Division By Zero which
significantly differs from other attempts at Division By Zero.

  2016, Leuven, Belgium",,,,"physics.plasm-ph physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  WEST (Tungsten Environment in Steady-State Tokamak) will be operating by the
end of 2016 as a test bed for the ITER divertor components in long pulse
operation. In this context, radiative cooling of highly ionized impurities like
tungsten (W) sputtered from Plasma Facing Components (PFC) into the plasma core
is a critical issue since even small impurity concentrations below 10-4 degrade
significantly plasma performances and can lead to radiative collapse. In the
plasma core, tungsten emission is dominant in the Soft X-ray (SXR) range 0.1
keV -- 15 keV with complex contributions from line transition, radiative
recombination and Bremsstrahlung emission.This paper presents the recent
development of a synthetic SXR diagnostic using GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier)
detectors. This diagnostic will be used on WEST for W transport studies and
will be equipped with two new GEM based poloidal cameras allowing 2D
tomographic reconstructions with spectral resolution in energy bands. Thus once
GEM response to plasma emissivity is characterized thanks to synthetic
diagnostic, it offers new possibilities to disentangle the different SXR
contributions in harsh fusion environments like e.g. WEST or ITER with respect
to conventional semiconductor diodes working in current mode. Emitted SXR
spectrum from the plasma is modelled thanks to ADAS database from given WEST
scenario. The synthetic diagnostic includes Lines of Sight (LoS) etendues of
the two cameras as well as probability of photoabsorption through filters,
photoionization in the detection gas mixture (Ar-CO2), and transport of
electron avalanches in the gas through GEM foils as computed with Magboltz.
Local SXR emissivity is then retrieved from tomographic inversion using a
Minimum Fisher Information (MFI) algorithm.

  Archimedean copulas","63 pages, one attachment in attachment.pdf",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Research on structure determination and parameter estimation of hierarchical
Archimedean copulas (HACs) has so far mostly focused on the case in which all
appearing Archimedean copulas belong to the same Archimedean family. The
present work addresses this issue and proposes a new approach for estimating
HACs that involve different Archimedean families. It is based on employing
goodness-of-fit test statistics directly into HAC estimation. The approach is
summarized in a simple algorithm, its theoretical justification is given and
its applicability is illustrated by several experiments, which include
estimation of HACs involving up to five different Archimedean families.

  Multi-Wall Multi-Floor Propagation Model","Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (March 2019)",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Widespread adoption of indoor positioning systems based on WiFi
fingerprinting is at present hindered by the large efforts required for
measurements collection during the offline phase. Two approaches were recently
proposed to address such issue: crowdsourcing and RSS radiomap prediction,
based on either interpolation or propagation channel model fitting from a small
set of measurements. RSS prediction promises better positioning accuracy when
compared to crowdsourcing, but no systematic analysis of the impact of system
parameters on positioning accuracy is available. This paper fills this gap by
introducing ViFi, an indoor positioning system that relies on RSS prediction
based on Multi-Wall Multi-Floor (MWMF) propagation model to generate a discrete
RSS radiomap (virtual fingerprints). Extensive experimental results, obtained
in multiple independent testbeds, show that ViFi outperforms virtual
fingerprinting systems adopting simpler propagation models in terms of
accuracy, and allows a sevenfold reduction in the number of measurements to be
collected, while achieving the same accuracy of a traditional fingerprinting
system deployed in the same environment. Finally, a set of guidelines for the
implementation of ViFi in a generic environment, that saves the effort of
collecting additional measurements for system testing and fine tuning, is
proposed.

  Traffic",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the stochastic network with dynamic traffic. The
spatial distribution of access points (APs) and users are first modeled as
mutually independent Poisson point processes (PPPs). Different from most
previous literatures which assume all the APs are fully loaded, we consider the
fact that APs having no data to transmit do not generate interference to users.
The APs opportunistically share the channel according to the existence of the
packet to be transmitted and the proposed interference suppression strategy. In
the interference suppression region, only one AP can be active at a time to
transmit the packet on the channel and the other adjacent APs keep silent to
reduce serious interference. The idle probability of any AP, influenced by the
traffic load and availability of the channels, is analyzed. The density of
simultaneously active APs in the network is obtained and the packet loss rate
is further elaborated. We reveal the impacts of network features (e.g., AP
density, user density and channel state) and service features (e.g., user
request, packet size) on the network performance. Simulation results validate
our proposed model.

transfer the image into intercept-slope coordinate. Its diagonal properties
made it appropriate for some applications which need processes in different
degrees. Radon transform computation needs a lot of arithmetic operations which
makes it a compute-intensive algorithm. In literature an approximate algorithm
for computing Radon transform is introduces which reduces the complexity of
computations. But this algorithm is complex and need arbitrary accesses to
memory. In this paper we proposed an algorithm which accesses to memory
sequentially. In the following an architecture is introduced which uses
pipeline to reduce the time complexity of algorithm.
