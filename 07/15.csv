dependent viscosity, known as the shallow water equations. For arbitrary large
forcing we are able to construct a solution, provided the total mass is
sufficiently large. The main mathematical part is located in the construction
of solutions. Uniqueness is impossible to obtain, since the gradient of the
velocity is of magnitude of the force. The investigation is connected to the
corresponding singular limit as Mach number goes to zero and methods for weak
solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes system.

end-user programmers. It also simplifies matters for tool designers, because
they do not need to contend with malformed program text. This paper defines
Hazelnut, a structure editor based on a small bidirectionally typed lambda
calculus extended with holes and a cursor. Hazelnut goes one step beyond
syntactic well-formedness: its edit actions operate over statically meaningful
incomplete terms. Naively, this would force the programmer to construct terms
in a rigid ""outside-in"" manner. To avoid this problem, the action semantics
automatically places terms assigned a type that is inconsistent with the
expected type inside a hole. This safely defers the type consistency check
until the term inside the hole is finished. Hazelnut is a foundational
type-theoretic account of typed structure editing, rather than an end-user tool
itself. To that end, we describe how Hazelnut's rich metatheory, which we have
mechanized in Agda, guides the definition of an extension to the calculus. We
also discuss various plausible evaluation strategies for terms with holes, and
in so doing reveal connections with gradual typing and contextual modal type
theory, the Curry-Howard interpretation of contextual modal logic. Finally, we
discuss how Hazelnut's semantics lends itself to implementation as a functional
reactive program. Our reference implementation is written using js_of_ocaml.

(GIT) has an effective analogue for linear actions of a non-reductive algebraic
group $H$ with graded unipotent radical on a projective scheme $X$. Here the
linear action of $H$ is required to extend to a semi-direct product $\hat{H} =
H \rtimes \mathbb{G}_m$ with a multiplicative one-parameter group which acts on
the Lie algebra of the unipotent radical $U$ of $H$ with all weights strictly
positive, and which centralises a Levi subgroup $R \cong H/U$ of $H$.
  We show that $X$ has an $H$-invariant open subscheme (the 'hat-stable locus')
which has a geometric quotient by the $H$-action. This geometric quotient has a
projective completion which is a categorical quotient (indeed, a good quotient)
by $\hat{H}$ of an open subscheme of a blow-up of the product of $X$ with the
affine line; with additional blow-ups a projective completion which is itself a
geometric quotient can be obtained. Furthermore the hat-stable locus of $X$ and
the corresponding open subsets of the blow-ups of the product of $X$ with the
affine line can be described effectively using Hilbert-Mumford-like criteria
combined with the explicit blow-up constructions.
  Applications include the construction of moduli spaces of sheaves and Higgs
bundles of fixed Harder--Narasimhan type over a fixed nonsingular projective
scheme, and of moduli spaces of unstable projective curves of fixed
singularity. More recently, cohomology theory for reductive GIT quotients were
extended by the first and fourth author to the non-reductive situation studied
in this paper, and this was used to prove the Green--Griffiths--Lang and
Kobayashi hyperbolicity conjectures for generic projective hypersurfaces with
polynomial bounds on their degree.

from $10^{-6}$ to 0.1 Hz, which confirms the presence of a flat portion
(flat-topped noise) in the spectrum at frequencies $3\times 10^{-5}$ -
$10^{-3}$ Hz. The periodic variability (precession, nutation, eclipses) begins
to dominate significantly over the stochastic variability at lower frequencies,
which does not allow the stochastic variability to be studied reliably. The
best agreement with the observations is reached by the model with the flat
portion extending to $9.5\times10^{-6}$ Hz and a power-law spectrum with index
of 2.6 below that frequency. The jet nutation with a period of about three days
suggests that the time for the passage of material through the disk is less
than this value. Therefore, at frequencies below $4\times10^{-6}$ Hz, the power
spectrum probably does not reflect the disk structure. It may depend on other
factors, for example, a variable mass accretion rate supplied by the donor. The
flat portion may arise from a rapid decrease in the viscous time in the
supercritical or radiative disk zones. It could be related to the variability
of the X-ray jets that are formed in the supercritical region.

optimized the van der Waals (vdW) parameters both using GA and guided GA

statement) and shipped to the database over the wire where it is executed. The
results are then serialized and sent back to the ""client-code"" where they are
translated in the language's native datatypes. This round trip is detrimental
to performances but, worse, such a programming model prevents one from having
richer queries, namely queries containing user-defined functions (that is
functions defined by the programmer and used e.g. in the filter condition of a
SQL query). While some databases also possess a ""server-side"" language (e.g.
PL/SQL in Oracle database), its integration with the very-optimized query
execution engine is still minimal and queries containing (PL/SQL) user-defined
functions remain notoriously inefficient. In this setting, we reviewed existing
language-integrated query frameworks, highlighting that existing database query
languages (including SQL) share high-level querying primitives (e.g.,
filtering, joins, aggregation) that can be represented by operators, but differ
widely regarding the semantics of their expression language. In order to
represent queries in an application language- and database-agnostic manner, we
designed a small calculus, dubbed ""QIR"" for Query Intermediate Representation.
QIR contains expressions, corresponding to a small extension of the pure
lambda-calculus, and operators to represent usual querying primitives. In the
effort to send efficient queries to the database, we abstracted the idea of
""good"" query representations in a measure on QIR terms. Then, we designed an
evaluation strategy rewriting QIR query representations into ""better"" ones.

message and his input $y$ if the edit distance between $x$ and $y$ is no more
than $K$, and output ""error"" otherwise. Both the encoding and decoding can be
done in time $\tilde{O}(n+\mathsf{poly}(K))$. This result significantly
improves the previous communication bounds under polynomial encoding/decoding
time. We also show that in the referee model, where Alice and Bob hold $x$ and
$y$ respectively, they can compute sketches of $x$ and $y$ of sizes
$\mathsf{poly}(K \log n)$ bits (the encoding), and send to the referee, who can
then compute the edit distance between $x$ and $y$ together with all the edit
operations if the edit distance is no more than $K$, and output ""error""
otherwise (the decoding). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
result for sketching edit distance using $\mathsf{poly}(K \log n)$ bits.
Moreover, the encoding phase of our sketching algorithm can be performed by
scanning the input string in one pass. Thus our sketching algorithm also
implies the first streaming algorithm for computing edit distance and all the
edits exactly using $\mathsf{poly}(K \log n)$ bits of space.

  The extended Gelfand-Tsetlin graph, introduced in that paper, is a novel
combinatorial object. Its q-boundary is formed by infinite point configurations
on a two-sided q-lattice. The q-boundary carries a continuous family of
probability measures that are a q-analogue of the so-called zw-measures, which
originated in the problem of harmonic analysis on the infinite-dimensional
unitary group.
  In the present paper, it is proved that certain transition Markov kernels,
linked to the extended Gelfand-Tsetlin graph and its q-boundary, possess the
Feller property. This property is needed for constructing a model of Markov
dynamics on the q-boundary. A connection with the classical B-splines and their
q-analogues is discussed. Some results of the paper arXiv:1504.06832 are
rederived in another way.

certifying this fact. On the technical side, our results follow from (i)
estimating precisely the ""quantum norm"" of a random matrix, and (ii) lower
bounding sharply enough its ""classical norm"", hence proving a gap between the

released information must provide accurate and useful statistics about the

privacy has received much attention in theoretical computer science, machine
learning, and statistics. It provides a rigorous and strong notion of
protection for individuals' sensitive information. A fundamental question is
how to incorporate differential privacy into traditional statistical inference
procedures. In this paper we study model selection in multivariate linear
regression under the constraint of differential privacy. We show that model
selection procedures based on penalized least squares or likelihood can be made
differentially private by a combination of regularization and randomization,
and propose two algorithms to do so. We show that our private procedures are
consistent under essentially the same conditions as the corresponding
non-private procedures. We also find that under differential privacy, the
procedure becomes more sensitive to the tuning parameters. We illustrate and
evaluate our method using simulation studies and two real data examples.

super-rectangular cover theory is developed to characterize both the unique
identifiability and full reliability. This theory states that a transmitted
matrix signal can be uniquely identified if and only if the cover order is
equal to the transmitter aperture number, i.e., full cover. In addition, we
prove that full reliability is guaranteed for space-time block coded MIMO-OWC
over commonly used log-normal fading channels with an ML detector if and only
if the STBC enables full cover. In addition, the diversity gain can be
geometrically interpreted as the cover order of the super-rectangle, which
should be maximized, and the volume of this super-rectangle, as the diversity
loss, should be minimized. Using this established error performance criterion,
the optimal linear STBC for block fading channels is proved to be spatial
repetition code with an optimal power allocation. The design of the optimal
non-linear STBC is shown to be equivalent to constructing the optimal
multi-dimensional constellation. Specifically, a multi-dimensional

on ordering questions to engage the respondent and collect hopefully all

respondent, for accurate imputations. In another scenario, our goal is to
provide a personalized prediction. Since it is possible to give reasonable
predictions with only a subset of questions, we are not concerned with
motivating users to answer all questions. Instead, we want to order questions
to get information that reduces prediction uncertainty, while not being too
burdensome. We illustrate this framework with an example of providing energy
estimates to prospective tenants. We also discuss DQO for national surveys and
consider connections between our statistics-based question-ordering approach

derive outer approximations for the feasible set of a homogeneous quadratic

that under mild assumptions a convergent, non-decreasing sequence of lower
bounds for the optimal cost can be computed with a sequence of semidefinite
programs (SDPs). Second, we obtain inner approximations in terms of LMIs and
sum-of-squares constraints, so upper bounds for the optimal cost and strictly
feasible points for the integral inequality can also be computed with SDPs. To
aid the formulation and solution of our SDP relaxations, we implement our
techniques in QUINOPT, an open-source add-on to YALMIP. We demonstrate our

functions of different shape are investigated, corresponding to three
physically relevant scenarios. They include a simple two-pole model function
and two flavours of the non-interacting Hubbard model on a square lattice, i.e.
a single-orbital metallic system and a two-orbitals insulating system. The
effect of numerical noise in the input data on the analytical continuation is
discussed in detail. Overall, the stochastic method by Mishchenko et al. [Phys.

input data whose numerical precision is not known. For high precision input

ionization and thermal state of the intergalactic medium (IGM), regulates the
formation of high-redshift galaxies, and is thus a key quantity for modeling
cosmic reionization. The vast majority of cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations implement the UVB via a set of spatially uniform photoionization
and photoheating rates derived from UVB synthesis models. We show that
simulations using canonical UVB rates reionize and, perhaps more importantly,
spuriously heat the IGM, much earlier z ~ 15 than they should. This problem
arises because at z > 6, where observational constraints are nonexistent, the
UVB amplitude is far too high. We introduce a new methodology to remedy this
issue, and we generate self-consistent photoionization and photoheating rates
to model any chosen reionization history. Following this approach, we run a
suite of hydrodynamical simulations of different reionization scenarios and
explore the impact of the timing of reionization and its concomitant heat
injection on the the thermal state of the IGM. We present a comprehensive study
of the pressure smoothing scale of IGM gas, illustrating its dependence on the
details of both hydrogen and helium reionization, and argue that it plays a
fundamental role in interpreting Lyman-alpha forest statistics and the thermal
evolution of the IGM. The premature IGM heating we have uncovered implies that
previous work has likely dramatically overestimated the impact of

"1607.04219","Robert Schaback","Robert Schaback","Superconvergence of Kernel-Based Interpolation",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well-known that univariate cubic spline interpolation, if carried out
on point sets with fill distance $h$, converges only like ${\cal O}(h^2)$ in
$L_2[a,b]$ for functions in $W_2^2[a,b]$ if no additional assumptions are made.
But superconvergence up to order $h^4$ occurs if more smoothness is assumed and
if certain additional boundary conditions are satisfied. This phenomenon was
generalized in 1999 to multivariate interpolation in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert
Spaces on domains $\Omega\subset R^d$ for continuous positive definite
Fourier-transformable shift-invariant kernels on $R^d$. But the sufficient
condition for superconvergence given in 1999 still needs further analysis,
because the interplay between smoothness and boundary conditions is not clear
at all. Furthermore, if only additional smoothness is assumed, superconvergence
is numerically observed in the interior of the domain, but without explanation,
so far. This paper first generalizes the ""improved error bounds"" of 1999 by an
abstract theory that includes the Aubin-Nitsche trick and the known
superconvergence results for univariate polynomial splines. Then the paper
analyzes what is behind the sufficient conditions for superconvergence. They
split into conditions on smoothness and localization, and these are
investigated independently. If sufficient smoothness is present, but no
additional localization conditions are assumed, it is proven that
superconvergence always occurs in the interior of the domain. If smoothness and
localization interact in the kernel-based case on $R^d$, weak and strong
boundary conditions in terms of pseudodifferential operators occur. A special
section on Mercer expansions is added, because Mercer eigenfunctions always
satisfy the sufficient conditions for superconvergence. Numerical examples
illustrate the theoretical findings.

mechanical response of binary Lennard-Jones glasses to athermal, quasistatic
pure shear as a function of the cooling rate used to prepare them. We find
several key results concerning the connection between strain-induced particle
rearrangements and mechanical response. We show that more rapidly cooled
glasses undergo more frequent and larger particle rearrangements than slowly
cooled glasses. We find that the ratio of the shear to bulk moduli decreases
with increasing cooling rate, which suggests that more rapidly cooled glasses
are more ductile than slowly cooled samples. In addition, we characterized the
degree of reversibility of particle motion during cyclic shear. We find that
irreversible particle motion occurs even in the putative linear regime of
stress versus strain. However, slowly cooled glasses, which undergo smaller
rearrangements, are more reversible under cyclic shear than rapidly cooled
glasses. Thus, we show that more ductile glasses are also less reversible.

order to resolve this problem we propose to treat user feedback as a
categorical variable and model it with users and items in a ternary way. We
employ a third-order tensor factorization technique and implement a higher
order folding-in method to support online recommendations. The method is
equally sensitive to entire spectrum of user ratings and is able to accurately
predict relevant items even from a negative only feedback. Our method may
partially eliminate the need for complicated rating elicitation process as it
provides means for personalized recommendations from the very beginning of an
interaction with a recommender system. We also propose a modification of
standard metrics which helps to reveal unwanted biases and account for
sensitivity to a negative feedback. Our model achieves state-of-the-art quality
in standard recommendation tasks while significantly outperforming other

The interaction vertex is a simple overlap with no operator insertions at the

scattering amplitudes by bosonizing the Grassmann fields, each pair equivalent
to one compactified bosonic field, and applying Mandelstam's interacting string

cover the full 1.8-2.5 THz frequency range but in its first implementation, the
observing range was limited to observations of the [CII] line at 1.9 THz in
2015 and extended to 1.83-2.07 THz in 2016. The instrument sensitivities are
state-of-the-art and the first scientific observations performed shortly after
the commissioning confirm that the time efficiency for large scale imaging is
improved by more than an order of magnitude as compared to single pixel
receivers. An example of large scale mapping around the Horsehead Nebula is
presented here illustrating this improvement. The array has been added to

  Applications in the Minerals Industries",,,,"cs.RO cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate measurement of blast-induced rock fragmentation is of great
importance for many mining operations. The post-blast rock size distribution
can significantly influence the efficiency of all the downstream mining and
comminution processes. Image analysis methods are one of the most common
methods used to measure rock fragment size distribution in mines regardless of
criticism for lack of accuracy to measure fine particles and other perceived
deficiencies. The current practice of collecting rock fragmentation data for
image analysis is highly manual and provides data with low temporal and spatial
resolution. Using UAVs for collecting images of rock fragments can not only
improve the quality of the image data but also automate the data collection
process. Ultimately, real-time acquisition of high temporal- and
spatial-resolution data based on UAV technology will provide a broad range of
opportunities for both improving blast design without interrupting the
production process and reducing the cost of the human operator. This paper
presents the results of a series of laboratory-scale rock fragment measurements
using a quadrotor UAV equipped with a camera. The goal of this work is to
highlight the benefits of aerial fragmentation analysis in terms of both
prediction accuracy and time effort. A pile of rock fragments with different
fragment sizes was placed in a lab that is equipped with a motion capture
camera system for precise UAV localization and control. Such an environment
presents optimal conditions for UAV flight and thus, is well-suited for
conducting proof-of-concept experiments before testing them in large-scale
field experiments. The pile was photographed by a camera attached to the UAV,
and the particle size distribution curves were generated in almost real-time.
The pile was also manually photographed and the results of the manual method
were compared to the UAV method.

curvature aposteriori. When we leave the context of unified field theory, and

we can show that the propagation of shock waves does not define a lightcone
when the purely affine theory is local and avoids the explicit use of the Ricci

molecular atmospheres of water, CO2, N2, or other species. Here, we
systematically investigate the effects of atmospheric bulk compositions on
temperature and wind distributions for tidally locked sub-Jupiter-sized
planets, using an idealized 3D general circulation model (GCM). The bulk
composition effects are characterized in the framework of two independent
variables: molecular weight and molar heat capacity. The effect of molecular
weight dominates. As the molecular weight increases, the atmosphere tends to
have a larger day-night temperature contrast, a smaller eastward phase shift in
the thermal phase curve and a smaller zonal wind speed. The width of the
equatorial super-rotating jet also becomes narrower and the ""jet core"" region,
where the zonal-mean jet speed maximizes, moves to a greater pressure level.
The zonal-mean zonal wind is more prone to exhibit a latitudinally alternating
pattern in a higher-molecular-weight atmosphere. We also present analytical
theories that quantitatively explain the above trends and shed light on the
underlying dynamical mechanisms. Those trends might be used to indirectly
determine the atmospheric compositions on tidally locked sub-Jupiter-sized
planets. The effects of the molar heat capacity are generally small. But if the
vertical temperature profile is close to adiabatic, molar heat capacity will
play a significant role in controlling the transition from a divergent flow in
the upper atmosphere to a jet-dominated flow in the lower atmosphere.

Deep archival X-ray observations constrain the X-ray positional uncertainty of

counterpart. Optical spectroscopic observations reveal the presence of broad,
shallow He i absorption lines while no sign of hydrogen is present, consistent
with a high state system. We present the optical lightcurve from Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment monitoring, spanning 15 years. It shows no
evidence for outbursts; variability is present at the 0.2 mag level on
timescales ranging from hours to weeks. A modulation on a timescale of years is
also observed. A Lomb-Scargle analysis of the optical lightcurves shows two
significant periodicities at 22.90 and 23.22 min. Although the physical
interpretation is uncertain, such timescales are in line with expectations for
the orbital and superhump periods. We estimate the distance to the source to be
between 0.5 - 1.1 kpc. Spectroscopic follow-up observations are required to
establish the orbital period, and to determine whether this source can serve as

encloses the point-like X-ray source at the centre of the nebula,
1E161348-5055. Its nature has been long debated due to a periodicity of 6.67 hr
in X-rays, which could indicate either an extremely slow pulsating neutron
star, or the orbital period of a very compact X-ray binary system. We found
that 20 min before the BAT trigger, the soft X-ray emission of 1E161348-5055
was a factor of ~100 higher than measured 2 yr earlier, indicating that an
outburst had already started. By comparing the spectral and timing

also the 6.67 hr pulsed profile has significantly changed with a clear phase

not reveal any counterpart at the position of 1E161348-5055. Based on these

axial vector potential, on the electromagnetic response and the energy spectrum

either from inhomogeneous strain or non-uniform magnetization and can also be

enhancement of the conductivity as $\sigma\sim \mathbf{B}_{5} ^{2}$ due to an
underlying chiral pseudo magnetic effect. We then use two lattice models to
analyze the effect of $\mathbf{B}_5$ on the spectral properties of topological
semimetals. We describe the emergent pseudo-Landau level structure for

surface states of Weyl semimetals, the Fermi arcs, can be reinterpreted as
$n=0$ pseudo-Landau levels resulting from a $\mathbf{B}_5$ confined to the

$\mathbf{B}_5$ creates pseudo-Landau levels interpolating in real space between
Fermi arcs at opposite surfaces and (iii) there are equilibrium bound currents
proportional to $\mathbf{B}_{5}$ that average to zero over the sample, which

applications ranging from microbial populations to human societies. Research
has shown, however, that mobility jeopardizes biodiversity by promoting the
formation of spiral waves, especially if there is no conservation law in place
for the total number of competing players. Firstly, we show that even if such a
conservation law applies, mobility still jeopardizes biodiversity in the
spatial rock-paper-scissors game if only a small fraction of links of the
square lattice is randomly rewired. Secondly, we show that zealots are very
effective in taming the amplitude of oscillations that emerge due to mobility
and/or interaction randomness, and this regardless of whether the later is
quenched or annealed. While even a tiny fraction of zealots brings significant
benefits, at 5\% occupancy zealots practically destroy all oscillations
regardless of the intensity of mobility, and regardless of the type and
strength of randomness in the interaction structure. Interestingly, by annealed
randomness the impact of zealots is qualitatively the same as by mobility,
which highlights that fast diffusion does not necessarily destroy the
coexistence of species, and that zealotry thus helps to recover the stable
mean-field solution. Our results strengthen the important role of zealots in
models of cyclic dominance, and they reveal fascinating evolutionary outcomes
in structured populations that are a unique consequence of such uncompromising
behavior.

the presence of an important crossover effect from the zero pinning-field to a
critical adsorption fixed point. In line with field-theoretical results, we
find that at the critical adsorption fixed point the short-distance expansion

consolidation. The point of departure in the description are the basic
equations of elasticity (i.e. constitutive law, equations of equilibrium in
terms of stresses, and the definition of strain), together with the principle
of effective stress, and the law of Darcy for fluid flow in porous media. These
equations, together with the principle of mass conservation, are the only
premises used to derive a drained description of consolidation theory. Next,
the increment of fluid content is defined and its constitutive law is derived -
with its derivation following naturally from the equation of fluid mass
balance. Pore pressure, storage, and undrained coefficients are also introduced
and useful relations are proven. Where appropriate, the physical meaning of
these coefficients is proven mathematically. Equations of equilibrium and fluid
mass conservation are subsequently expressed in terms of the increment of fluid
content and undrained coefficients, leading to an undrained description of
consolidation theory. Thus the initial approach of using drained description is
extended to the formalism of Rice and Cleary. This approach to
three-dimensional consolidation is useful for its simplicity. It does not
require the ad-hoc definition of constants and that of an elastic energy
potential. Instead, it is a direct extension to linear elasticity that accounts
for the coupling of skeletal deformations and fluid behaviour.

dispersion-the M-sigma relation-for massive quiescent galaxies at z<0.7. We
measure the local relation from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the
intermediate redshift relation from the Smithsonian Hectospec Lensing Survey.
Both samples are highly complete (>85%) and we consistently measure the stellar
mass and velocity dispersion for the two samples. The M-sigma relation and its
scatter are independent of redshift with sigma ~ M^0.3 for M>10^10.3 M_solar.
The measured slope of the M-sigma relation is the same as the scaling between
the total halo mass and the dark matter halo velocity dispersion obtained by
N-body simulations. This consistency suggests that massive quiescent galaxies
are virialized systems where the central dark matter concentration is either a
constant or negligible fraction of the stellar mass. The relation between the
total galaxy mass (stellar + dark matter) and the central stellar velocity
dispersion is consistent with the observed relation between the total mass of a
galaxy cluster and the velocity dispersion of the cluster members. This result
suggests that the central stellar velocity dispersion is directly proportional
to the velocity dispersion of the dark matter halo. Thus the central stellar
velocity dispersion is a fundamental, directly observable property of galaxies
that may robustly connect galaxies to dark matter halos in N-body simulations.
To interpret the results further in the context of Lambda-CDM, it would be
useful to analyze the relationship between the velocity dispersion of stellar
particles and the velocity dispersion characterizing their dark matter halos in
high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.

repeated starbursts propagate through the circumgalactic medium (CGM), using
the simulation code RAMSES. We assume that the outflow from the disk can be
modelled as a rapidly moving bubble of hot gas at $\mathrm{\sim1\;kpc}$ above
disk, then ask what happens as it moves out further into the halo around the
galaxy on $\mathrm{\sim 100\;kpc}$ scales. To do this we run 60 two-dimensional
simulations scanning over parameters of the outflow. Each of these is repeated
with and without radiative cooling, assuming a primordial gas composition to
give a lower bound on the importance of cooling. In a large fraction of
radiative-cooling cases we are able to form rapidly outflowing cool gas from in
situ cooling of the flow. We show that the amount of cool gas formed depends
strongly on the 'burstiness' of energy injection; sharper, stronger bursts
typically lead to a larger fraction of cool gas forming in the outflow. The
abundance ratio of ions in the CGM may therefore change in response to the
detailed historical pattern of star formation. For instance, outflows generated
by star formation with short, intense bursts contain up to 60 per cent of their
gas mass at temperatures $<5 \times 10^4\,\mathrm{K}$; for near-continuous star
formation the figure is $\lesssim$ 5 per cent. Further study of cosmological
simulations, and of idealised simulations with e.g., metal-cooling, magnetic
fields and/or thermal conduction, will help to understand the precise signature
of bursty outflows on observed ion abundances.

of this, we also analyzed the movement of spiral structures in multi-epoch

low-redshift starburst galaxies, although it deviates at high stellar masses.
Our data provide new measurements of the total SFR density (SFRD) in
$M_\ast>10^{10}M_\odot$ galaxies at $0.5<z<6$. This is dominated by obscured
star formation by a factor of $>10$. One third of this is accounted for by
450$\mu$m-detected sources, while one fifth is attributed to UV-luminous

obscured. By extrapolating our results to include all stellar masses, we
estimate a total SFRD that is in good agreement with previous results from IR

star-formation history undergoes a transition at $z\sim3-4$, as predominantly
unobscured growth in the early Universe is overtaken by obscured star
formation, driven by the build-up of the most massive galaxies during the peak

reproduces the fast inspiral and stalling experienced by satellites orbiting
galaxies with a large constant density core. We show that the fast inspiral
phase does not owe to resonance. Rather, it owes to the background velocity
distribution function for the constant density cores being dissimilar from the
usually-assumed Maxwellian distribution. Using the correct background velocity
distribution function and the semi-analytic model from Petts et al. (2015), we
are able to correctly reproduce the infall rate in both cored and cusped
potentials. However, in the case of large cores, our model is no longer able to
correctly capture core-stalling. We show that this stalling owes to the tidal
radius of the satellite approaching the size of the core. By switching off
dynamical friction when rt(r) = r (where rt is the tidal radius at the
satellite's position) we arrive at a model which reproduces the N-body results
remarkably well. Since the tidal radius can be very large for constant density
background distributions, our model recovers the result that stalling can occur
for Ms/Menc << 1, where Ms and Menc are the mass of the satellite and the
enclosed galaxy mass, respectively. Finally, we include the contribution to
dynamical friction that comes from stars moving faster than the satellite. This
next-to-leading order effect becomes the dominant driver of inspiral near the
core region, prior to stalling.

post-process the results of a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation with a
chemical evolution model, which includes dust formation by supernovae and
intermediate mass stars, dust destruction in supernova shocks, and grain growth
by accretion of gas-phase elements in dense gas. We find that observations
require a steep, Small Magellanic Cloud-like extinction curve and a clumpy dust
distribution, where stellar populations younger than 15 Myr are still embedded
in their dusty natal clouds. Investigating the scatter in the colour
distribution and stellar mass, we find that the observed trends can be
explained by the presence of two populations: younger, less massive galaxies
where dust enrichment is mainly due to stellar sources, and massive, more
chemically evolved ones, where efficient grain growth provides the dominant
contribution to the total dust mass. Computing the IR-excess - UV color
relation we find that all but the dustiest model galaxies follow a relation
shallower than the Meurer et al. (1999) one, usually adopted to correct the
observed UV luminosities of high-$z$ galaxies for the effects of dust
extinction. As a result, their total star formation rates might have been
over-estimated. Our study illustrates the importance to incorporate a proper
treatment of dust in simulations of high-$z$ galaxies, and that massive, dusty,
UV-faint galaxies might have already appeared at $z \lesssim 7$.

fact, it has been shown that the pairs of nonisomorphic CFI-graphs (introduced
by Cai, F\""urer, and Immerman in 1992 as hard examples for the combinatorial
Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm) cannot be distinguished by these mathematical
algorithms. A notable exception were the algebraic algorithms over the field
GF(2), for which no lower bound was known. Another, in some way even stronger,
approach to graph isomorphism testing is based on solving systems of linear
Diophantine equations (that is, linear equations over the integers), which is
known to be possible in polynomial time. So far, no lower bounds for this
approach were known.
  Lower bounds for the algebraic algorithms can best be proved in the framework
of proof complexity, where they can be phrased as lower bounds for algebraic
proof systems such as Nullstellensatz or the (more powerful) polynomial
calculus. We give new hard examples for these systems: families of pairs of
non-isomorphic graphs that are hard to distinguish by polynomial calculus
proofs simultaneously over all prime fields, including GF(2), as well as
examples that are hard to distinguish by the
systems-of-linear-Diophantine-equations approach.

what we call ""group CSPs"": constraint satisfaction problems where the
constraints are membership tests in some coset of a subgroup of a cartesian
power of a base group (Z_2 in the case of the classical CFI-graphs). Our new
examples are also based on group CSPs (for Abelian groups), but here we extend
the CSPs by a few non-group constraints to obtain even harder instances for

the optimal X-ray emission in the early universe for promoting the formation of
Pop III stars. This is important in determining the number of dwarf galaxies
formed before reionization and their fossils in the local universe, as well as
the number of intermediate-mass seed black holes. A mean X-ray emission per
source above the optimal level reduces the number of Pop III stars because of
the increased Jeans mass of the intergalactic medium (IGM), while a lower
emission suppresses the formation rate of H2 preventing or delaying star
formation in dark matter minihalos above the Jeans mass. The build up of the H2
dissociating background is slower than the X-ray background due to the
shielding effect of resonant hydrogen Lyman lines. Hence, the nearly
unavoidable X-ray emission from supernova remnants of Pop III stars is
sufficient to boost their number to few tens per comoving Mpc^3 by redshift
z~15. We find that there is a critical X-ray to UV energy ratio emitted per
source that produces a universe where the number of Pop III stars is largest:
400 per comoving- Mpc^3. This critical ratio is very close to the one provided
by 20-40 M_sun Pop III stars exploding as hypernovae. High mass X-ray binaries
in dwarf galaxies are far less effective at increasing the number of Pop III
stars than normal supernova remnants, we thus conclude that supernovae drove

dense gas in which stars are formed tends to have a disk structure, stars are
found in spheroids with little rotation. Halos with masses between 10^6 M_sun
and 5x10^8 M_sun form stars stochastically, with stellar masses in the range
10^4 M_sun to 2x10^6 M_sun. Nearly independent of stellar mass, we observe a
large range of half-light radii for the stars, from a few parsecs to a few
hundred parsecs and surface brightnesses and mass-to-light ratios ranging from
those typical of globular clusters to ultra-faint dwarfs. In our simulations,
stars form in dense stellar clusters with high gas-to-star conversion
efficiencies and rather uniform metallicities. A fraction of these clusters
remain bound after the gas is removed by feedback, but others are destroyed,
and their stars, which typically have velocity dispersions of 20 to 40 km/s,
expand until they become bound by the dark matter halo. We thus speculate that
the stars in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies may show kinematic and chemical
signatures consistent with their origin in a few distinct stellar clusters. On
the other hand, some globular clusters may form at the center of primordial
dwarf galaxies and may contain dark matter, perhaps detectable in the outer

studying how to enclose three prescribed areas in the Grushin plane, using the
least amount of perimeter, under an additional ""one-dimensional"" constraint on
the intersections of their boundaries. We prove existence of regular solutions
for this problem, and we characterize them in terms of isoperimetric sets,
showing differences with the Euclidean case. The problem arises from the study
of quantitative isoperimetric inequalities and has connections with the theory
of minimal clusters.

a function of the FWHM and $\sigma_{z}$, the $z$ component of velocity
dispersion. For different values of $\theta_{0}$ we find that $ 1.0 \lesssim f

Moreover we have $ 0.5 \lesssim f \lesssim 6.5 $ for different values of FWHM

also find that $ f $ is relatively insensitive to the variations of bolometric
luminosity and column density of each cloud and the range of variation of $ f $
is in order of 0.01. Considering wide range of $ f $ we see the use of average
virial factor $ \langle f \rangle $ is not very safe. Therefore we propose AGN
community to divide a sample into a few subsamples based on the value of $

the VC lose their ability to reflect the spectra of turbulence. Combining our

conclude that centroids are applicable for studies subsonic/transsonic
turbulence for the range of scales that is limited by the absorption effects.
We also consider VCs based on absorption lines and define the range of their
applicability. We address the problem of analytical description of spectra and
anisotropies of fluctuations that are available through studies using VC. We
obtain spectra and anisotropy of VC fluctuations arising from Alfv\'en, slow

bounds on how many projections are needed to accurately preserve the geometry

However, such works employ definitions of volume and curvature that are
inherently difficult to compute. Therefore such theory cannot be easily tested

We instead study typical distortions arising in random projections of an
ensemble of smooth Gaussian random manifolds. We find explicitly computable,
approximate theoretical bounds on the number of projections required to
accurately preserve the geometry of these manifolds. Our bounds, while
approximate, can only be violated with a probability that is exponentially
small in the ambient dimension, and therefore they hold with high probability
in cases of practical interest. Moreover, unlike previous work, we test our
theoretical bounds against numerical experiments on the actual geometric
distortions that typically occur for random projections of random smooth

3-band tight-binding model. The unstrained system shows a topological phase
with Majorana zero modes localized at the boundaries of the one-dimensional
(1D) zigzag edges. By direct inspection of the spectrum and wave functions we
examine the evolution of the topological phase as an in-plane, uniaxial
deformation is imposed. It is found that strain shifts the energy of 1D edge
states, thus causing a topological phase transition which eliminates the
Majorana modes. For realistic parameter values, we show that the effect of
strain can be changed from completely destructive -- in which case a small
built in strain is enough to destroy the topological phase -- to a situation
where strain becomes an effective tuning parameter which can be used to
manipulate Majorana zero modes. These two regimes are accessible by increasing
the value of the applied Zeeman field within realistic values. We also study
how strain effects are affected by the chemical potential, showing in
particular how unwanted effects can be minimized. Finally, as a cross-check of
the obtained results, we reveal the connection between 1D Majorana zero modes

non-zero values of the degeneracy parameter ($\psi = \frac{kT}{\mu_{F}}$, where
$\mu_{F}$ is the Fermi energy). We review the derivation of surface luminosity
using an entropy matching condition and the first-order phase transition
between the molecular hydrogen in the outer envelope and the partially-ionized
hydrogen in the inner region. We also discuss the results of modern simulations
of the plasma phase transition, which illustrate the uncertainties in
determining its critical temperature. Based on the existing models and with
some simple modification we find the maximum mass for a brown dwarf to be in

evolution allows us to estimate the time period of the non-steady state (i.e.,
non-main sequence) nuclear burning for substellar objects. Standard models also
predict that stars that are just above the substellar mass limit can reach an

git-based source code management platform and also many features inspired by
social networks. For example, GitHub users can show appreciation to projects by
adding stars to them. Therefore, the number of stars of a repository is a
direct measure of its popularity. In this paper, we use multiple linear
regressions to predict the number of stars of GitHub repositories. These
predictions are useful both to repository owners and clients, who usually want
to know how their projects are performing in a competitive open source
development market. In a large-scale analysis, we show that the proposed models
start to provide accurate predictions after being trained with the number of
stars received in the last six months. Furthermore, specific models---generated
using data from repositories that share the same growth trends---are
recommended for repositories with slow growth and/or for repositories with less
stars. Finally, we evaluate the ability to predict not the number of stars of a
repository but its rank among the GitHub repositories. We found a very strong
correlation between predicted and real rankings (Spearman's rho greater than
0.95).

approaches, such as Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SFL) techniques, which
pinpoint program elements more likely to contain faults. This survey discusses
the state-of-the-art of SFL, including the different techniques that have been
proposed, the type and number of faults they address, the types of spectra they
use, the programs they utilize in their validation, the testing data that
support them, and their use at industrial settings. Notwithstanding the
advances, there are still challenges for the industry to adopt these
techniques, which we analyze in this paper. SFL techniques should propose new
ways to generate reduced sets of suspicious entities, combine different spectra
to fine-tune the fault localization ability, use strategies to collect
fine-grained coverage levels from suspicious coarser levels for balancing
execution costs and output precision, and propose new techniques to cope with
multiple-fault programs. Moreover, additional user studies are needed to
understand better how SFL techniques can be used in practice. We conclude by
presenting a concept map about topics and challenges for future research in
SFL.

efficiency loophole. In this work, we show almost tight lower and upper bounds
of the detector efficiency requirement for demonstrating the nonlocality of

localization and entropic elasticity in chain polymer liquids in the absence of
ergodicity-restoring anisotropic reptation motion. The theory is formulated in
terms of a conformational N-dynamic-order-parameter Generalized Langevin
Equation approach. It is implemented using a field-theoretic Gaussian thread
model of polymer structure and closed in a universal manner at the level of the
chain dynamic second moment matrix. The physical idea is that the isotropic
Rouse model fails due to the dynamical emergence of time-persistent
intermolecular contacts determined by the combined influence of local chain
uncrossability, long range polymer connectivity and a self-consistent treatment
of chain motion and the dynamic forces that hinder it. For long chain melts,
the mesoscopic localization length (tube diameter) and emergent elasticity
predictions are in near quantitative agreement with experiment. Moreover, the
onset chain length scales with the semi-dilute crossover concentration with a
realistic numerical prefactor. Distinctive predictions are made for various
off-diagonal correlation functions that quantify the full spatial structure of
the dynamically localized polymer conformation. As the local uncrossability
constraint and/or intrachain bonding spring are softened, the tube diameter is
predicted to swell until it reaches the chain radius-of-gyration at which point
entanglement localization vanishes in a discontinuous manner. A full dynamic
phase diagram for the destruction of mesoscopic localization is constructed,
which is qualitatively consistent with simulations and the classical concept of
an entanglement degree of polymerization.

start and finish. Specific contributions include exact and fast approximation
methods for calculating the probability of a set of independent normally
distributed random events occurring in a given order, a method for calculating
the most likely and n-th most likely orders of occurrence for a set of
independent normally distributed random events that have equal standard
deviations, and a method for approximating the conditional probability
distributions of the events given a specific order of the events. The complete
framework is shown to be faster than a Monte Carlo approach for the same
accuracy in two multi-robot task allocation problems. In addition, the
importance of incorporating uncertainty is demonstrated through a comparison
with a deterministic method. This is a general framework that is agnostic to

strategizing in a mechanism with money are almost always assumed to incorporate
money as an objective through quasilinear valuations. We study a simple model
of value maximizers that captures online advertisers and other agents who may
view money solely as a constraint, and study general questions of mechanism
design for such agents. We show that the feasible and optimal points faced by a
mechanism designer change dramatically from the quasilinear realm and lay a

energy in the smart grid. In this context, a shared facility controller (SFC)
with a number of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in a smart community is
considered that has the capability to schedule the generated energy for
consumption and trade to other entities. Particularly, a mechanism is designed
for the SFC to decide on the energy surplus, if there is any, that it can use
to charge its battery and sell to the households and the grid based on the
offered prices. In this regard, a hierarchical energy management scheme is
proposed with a view to reduce the total operational cost to the SFC. The
concept of a virtual cost (VC) is introduced that aids the SFC to estimate its
future operational cost based on some available current information. The energy
management is conducted for three different cases and the optimal cost to the
SFC is determined for each case via the theory of maxima and minima. A
real-time algorithm is proposed to reach the optimal cost for all cases and
some numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the beneficial properties
of the proposed scheme.

the parameter of interest and is known as the semi-parametric Bernstein-von

applied in many examples. We consider models in which errors with symmetric

linear mixed effect models satisfy the semi-parametric Bernstein-von Mises

frequentist inferential optimality, as expressed e.g. through Hajek's

includes several components to capture the variability within that track. The
second phase takes into account both global structure and local structure. In
this phase, the components are rendered more discriminative and compact by
formulating an optimization problem on Grassmannian manifolds, which we found
represents the structure of audio effectively.
  Our experiments used the YLI-MED dataset (an open TRECVID-style video corpus
based on YFCC100M), which includes ten events. The results show that the
proposed DCAR representation consistently outperforms state-of-the-art audio
representations. DCAR's advantage over i-vector, mv-vector, and GMM
representations is significant for both easier and harder discrimination tasks.
We discuss how these performance differences across easy and hard cases follow
from how each type of model leverages (or doesn't leverage) the intrinsic
structure of the data. Furthermore, DCAR shows a particularly notable accuracy
advantage on events where humans have more difficulty classifying the videos,
i.e., events with lower mean annotator confidence.

roles as depletion-free tracers in studying galactic chemical evolution.
However, regarding red giants having evolved off the main sequence, reliable
abundance determinations of S and Zn seem to be difficult despite that a few
studies have been reported so far. Given this situation, we tried to establish
the abundances of these elements for an extensive sample of 239 field GK giants
(-0.8 < [Fe/H] < +0.2), by applying the spectrum-fitting technique to S I
8694-5, S I 6757, and Zn I 6362 lines and by taking into account the non-LTE
effect. Besides, similar abundance analysis was done for 160 FGK dwarfs to be
used for comparison. The non-LTE corrections for the S and Zn abundances
derived from these lines turned out < 0.1(-0.2) dex for most cases and not very
significant. It revealed that the S I 6757 feature is more reliable as an
abundance indicator than S I 8694-5 for the case of red giants, because the
latter suffers blending of unidentified lines. The finally resulting
[S/Fe]-[Fe/H] and [Zn/Fe]-[Fe/H] relations for GK giants were confirmed to be
in good agreement with those for FGK dwarfs, indicating that S and Zn
abundances of red giants are reliably determinable from the S I 6757 and Zn I
6362 lines. Accordingly, not only main-sequence stars but also evolved red
giant stars are usable for tracing the chemical evolution history of S and Zn
in the regime of disk metallicity by using these lines.

frequencies of the system, we show that the comb-drive actuator and the silicon
beam behave as two strongly coupled resonators. Interestingly, the effective
coupling rate (~ 1.5 MHz) is tunable with the comb-drive actuator (+10%) as
well as with a side-gate (-10%) placed close to the silicon beam. In contrast,
the effective spring constant of the system is insensitive to either of them
and changes only by $\pm$ 0.5%. Finally, we show that the comb-drive actuator
can be used to switch between different coupling rates with a frequency of at
least 10 kHz.

  Bayes confidence interval","18 pages, 2 tables",,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An empirical Bayes confidence interval has high user demand in many
applications. In particular, the second-order empirical Bayes confidence
interval, the coverage error of which is of the third order for large number of
areas, is widely used in small area estimation when the sample size within each
area is not large enough to make reliable direct estimates based on a
design-based approach. Yoshimori and Lahiri (2014a) proposed a new type of
confidence interval, called the second-order efficient empirical Bayes
confidence interval, whose length is less than that of the direct confidence
interval based on the design-based approach. However, this interval still has
some disadvantages: (i) it is hard to use when at least one leverage value is
high; (ii) many iterations tend to be required to obtain the estimators of one
global model variance parameter as the number of areas getting larger, due to
the area-specific adjustment factor. To prevent such issues, this paper
proposes, as never done before, a more efficient confidence interval to allow
for high leverage and reduce the number of iterations for large number of
areas, by adopting a non-area-specific adjustment factor, maintaining the
existing desired properties. We also reveal the relationship between the
general adjustment factor and the measure of uncertainty of the empirical Bayes
estimator to create a second-order confidence interval. Moreover, we present
two simulation studies and a real data analysis to show the efficiency of this
confidence interval.

of zero-temperature approximation in the truncated DOLS and the ignorance of
spatial occupation of localized states. Here, based on the multiple-trapping

can be used to investigate the electron transport in any disordered media
independent from the value of disorder parameter. In the proposed model,
instead of using a truncated DOLS we imply the raw DOLS. In addition, we have
introduced an occupation index for localized states to consider the effect of
spatial occupation of trap sites. The proposed model is justified in a simple
cubic lattice of trap sites for broad interval of disorder parameters, Fermi

developed and utilised to understand many different processes, including energy
transfer in photosynthesis and many-body effects in semiconductor
nanostructures. Double-quantum 2D spectroscopy is one variation that has been
particularly useful for understanding many-body effects. In condensed matter
systems, however, there are often many competing signal pathways, which can
make it difficult to isolate different contributions and retrieve quantitative
information. Here, a means of separating overlapping pathways while maintaining
the fidelity of the relevant peak/s is demonstrated. This selective approach is
used to isolate the double-quantum signal from a mixed two exciton state in a
semiconductor quantum well. The removal of overlapping peaks allows analysis of
the relevant peak-shape and thus details of interactions with the environment
and other carriers to be revealed. An alternative pulse ordering identifies a
double-quantum state associated only with GaAs defects, the signature of which
has previously been confused with other interaction induced effects. The
experimental approach described here provides access to otherwise hidden
details of excitonic interactions and demonstrates that the manner in which the
double-quantum coherence is generated can be important and provide an
additional control to help understand the many-body physics in complex systems.

because of the complexity of the many different ways an object can deform.
Searching such a high dimensional state space makes it difficult to recognize,
track, and manipulate deformable objects. In this paper, we introduce a
predictive, model-driven approach to address this challenge, using a
pre-computed, simulated database of deformable object models. Mesh models of
common deformable garments are simulated with the garments picked up in
multiple different poses under gravity, and stored in a database for fast and
efficient retrieval. To validate this approach, we developed a comprehensive
pipeline for manipulating clothing as in a typical laundry task. First, the
database is used for category and pose estimation for a garment in an arbitrary
position. A fully featured 3D model of the garment is constructed in real-time
and volumetric features are then used to obtain the most similar model in the
database to predict the object category and pose. Second, the database can
significantly benefit the manipulation of deformable objects via non-rigid
registration, providing accurate correspondences between the reconstructed
object model and the database models. Third, the accurate model simulation can
also be used to optimize the trajectories for manipulation of deformable
objects, such as the folding of garments. Extensive experimental results are
shown for the tasks above using a variety of different clothing.

high-precision astrometry. Second, we analysed observations of a globular

proper motions of stars in the field of view, we were able to model the
distortions affecting the stellar positions. We found that they can be as large

conclude that future astrometric studies with MICADO requires both an ADC and
an accurate modelling of distortions to the field of view, either through an

as alpha = -2.03 from previous deeper samples, the best fit of our QLF gives a
flatter bright end slope beta = -3.58+/-0.24 and a fainter break magnitude

computed PSF values specially for light nuclei. Further, we re-computed the
same PSF values but using the most recent Q-values reported in literature. In
several cases these new Q-values differ significantly from the older ones,
which results in large differences in the PSF values as compared with previous
results. These new PSF values proposed here, can contribute to a more reliable
calculation of the beta decay rates, which are key quantities in the study of
nuclei far from the stability line, as well as to better understanding of the
stellar evolution.

$P(X,Y,Z)={P(XZ)P(YZ)}/{P(Z)}$ such that the probability of deciding that $X$

the empirical beta copula. The latter turns out to be a particular case of the
empirical Bernstein copula, the degrees of all Bernstein polynomials being
equal to the sample size.
  Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for a Bernstein polynomial to
be a copula. These imply that the empirical beta copula is a genuine copula.
Furthermore, the empirical process based on the empirical Bernstein copula is
shown to be asymptotically the same as the ordinary empirical copula process

is still significantly better in several cases, especially in terms of bias.

as a key tool in algorithmic graph theory for the last decades. Recently, a
unifying concept behind all these orders has been shown: they can be described
by a graph decomposition into parts that have a prescribed vertex-connectivity.
  Despite extensive interest in canonical orderings, no analogue of this
unifying concept is known for edge-connectivity. In this paper, we establish
such a concept named edge-orders and show how to compute (1,1)-edge-orders of
2-edge-connected graphs as well as (2,1)-edge-orders of 3-edge-connected graphs
in linear time, respectively. While the former can be seen as the edge-variants
of st-numberings, the latter are the edge-variants of Mondshein sequences and
non-separating ear decompositions. The methods that we use for obtaining such
edge-orders differ considerably in almost all details from the ones used for
their vertex-counterparts, as different graph-theoretic constructions are used
in the inductive proof and standard reductions from edge- to
vertex-connectivity are bound to fail.
  As a first application, we consider the famous Edge-Independent Spanning Tree
Conjecture, which asserts that every k-edge-connected graph contains k rooted
spanning trees that are pairwise edge-independent. We illustrate the impact of
the above edge-orders by deducing algorithms that construct 2- and 3-edge
independent spanning trees of 2- and 3-edge-connected graphs, the latter of

thicknesses of 10 nm or less, encapsulated in 2D layers of hexagonal boron
nitride, we achieve unprecedented control over the CDW transition temperature,
tuned from 170 K to 40 K, and over the superconductivity transition
temperature, tuned from a quantum critical point at 0 K up to 3 K. Electrically
driving TiSe2 over different ordered electronic phases allows us to study the
details of the phase transitions between many-body states. Observations of
periodic oscillations of magnetoresistance induced by the Little Parks effect
show that the appearance of superconductivity is directly correlated to the
spatial texturing of the amplitude and phase of the superconductivity order
parameter, corresponding to a 2D matrix of superconductivity. We infer that
this superconductivity matrix is supported by a matrix of incommensurate CDW

manage its communication structure and mobility. In this paper, we consider
therefore the problem of establishing an efficient swarm movement model and a
network topology between a collection of UAVs, which are specifically deployed
for the scenario of high-quality forest-mapping.
  The forest environment with its highly heterogeneous distribution of trees
and obstacles represents an extreme challenge for a UAV swarm. It requires the
swarm to constantly avoid possible collisions with trees, to change
autonomously the trajectory, which can lead to disconnection to the swarm, and
to reconnect to the swarm after passing the obstacle, while continue collecting
environmental data that needs to be fused and assessed efficiently.
  In this paper, we propose a novel solution to the formation flight problem
for UAV swarms. The proposed method provides an adaptive and reliable network
structure, which maintains swarm connectivity and communicability. These
characteristics are needed to achieve a detailed and accurate description of
the environment from the data acquired by the UAV swarm.

the radiative force determined from the radiative transfer equation in the

Our models solve stationary hydrodynamical equations, that is the equation of

parameters. We predicted the wind mass-loss rate as a function of stellar
parameters, namely the stellar luminosity, effective temperature, and
metallicity. The derived wind parameters (mass-loss rates and terminal
velocities) agree with the values derived from the observations. The radiative
force is not able to accelerate the homogeneous wind for stars with low
effective temperatures and high surface gravities. We discussed the properties
of winds of individual subdwarfs. The X-ray irradiation may inhibit the flow in
binaries with compact components. In binaries with Be components, the winds
interact with the disk of the Be star. Stellar winds exist in subluminous stars
with low gravities or high effective temperatures. Despite their low mass-loss
rates, they are detectable in the ultraviolet spectrum and cause X-ray
emission. Subdwarf stars may lose a significant part of their mass during the

A grammar compression is a restricted CFG deriving the string
deterministically. An efficient grammar compression develops a smaller CFG by
finding duplicated patterns and removing them. This process is just a frequent
pattern discovery by grammatical inference. While we can get any frequent
pattern in linear time using a preprocessed string, a huge working space is
required for longer patterns, and the whole string must be loaded into the
memory preliminarily. We propose an online algorithm approximating this problem
within a compressed space. The main contribution is an improvement of the
previously best known approximation ratio $\Omega(\frac{1}{\lg^2m})$ to
$\Omega(\frac{1}{\lg^*N\lg m})$ where $m$ is the length of an optimal pattern
in a string of length $N$ and $\lg^*$ is the iteration of the logarithm base
$2$. For a sufficiently large $N$, $\lg^*N$ is practically constant. The
experimental results show that our algorithm extracts nearly optimal patterns

magnetic moment (muon g-2) can be explained by $\mu-\tau$ flavor violating
Yukawa couplings, motivated by the recent CMS excess in Higgs boson decay
$h\rightarrow \mu \tau$. We study Michel parameters for $\tau$ decays $\tau
\rightarrow l \nu \bar{\nu}~(l=e,~\mu)$ in the 2HDM with the lepton flavor
violation, and show that they can be sensitive to the flavor structure as well
as the Lorentz and chiral structures of the model. We find that the correction
to the Michel parameter $\xi_\mu$ in $\tau \rightarrow \mu \nu\bar{\nu}$ is
correlated to the contribution to the muon g-2, and it can be as large as
$10^{-4}-10^{-2}$ in the parameter region where the $\mu-\tau$ flavor violating
Yukawa couplings explain the muon g-2 anomaly. Therefore the precision
measurement of the Michel parameter at the level of $10^{-4}-10^{-2}$ would
significantly probe the interesting parameter space for the solution to the

systems of gluons that carry each a small fraction $x$ of the momenta of the
colliding nucleons. A distinguishing feature of such systems is the phenomenon
of ""saturation"" which tames the expected growth of the gluon density as the
energy of the collision increases. The onset of saturation occurs at a
particular transverse momentum scale, the ""saturation momentum"", that emerges
dynamically and that marks the onset of non-linear gluon interactions. At high
energy, and for large nuclei, the saturation momentum is large compared to the
typical hadronic scale, making high density gluons amenable to a description
with weak coupling techniques. This paper reviews some of the challenges faced
in the study of such dense systems of small $x$ gluons, and of the progress
made in addressing them. The focus is on conceptual issues, and the
presentation is both pedagogical, and critical. Examples where high gluon
density could play a visible role in heavy ion collisions are briefly discussed

users sequentially sense channels for opportunistic spectrum access. In this
scenario, the Channel Selection Algorithm (CSA) allows secondary users to find
a vacant channel with the minimal number of channel switches. Most of the
existing CSA literature assumes exponential ON-OFF time distribution for
primary users (PU) channel occupancy pattern. This exponential assumption might
be helpful to get performance bounds; but not useful to evaluate the
performance of CSA under realistic conditions. An in-depth analysis of
independent spectrum measurement traces reveals that wireless channels have
typically heavy-tailed PU OFF times. In this paper, we propose an extension to
the Predictive CSA framework and its generalization for heavy tailed PU OFF
time distribution, which represents realistic scenarios. In particular, we
calculate the probability of channel being idle for hyper-exponential OFF times
to use in CSA. We implement our proposed CSA framework in a wireless test-bed
and comprehensively evaluate its performance by recreating the realistic PU
channel occupancy patterns. The proposed CSA shows significant reduction in
channel switches and energy consumption as compared to Predictive CSA which
always assumes exponential PU ON-OFF times.Through our work, we show the impact
of the PU channel occupancy pattern on the performance of CSA in multichannel
CRN.

The method takes a program, modeled as a transition system, and a property
given by a CTL formula as input. It first generates a set of forall-exists
quantified Horn constraints and well-foundedness constraints by exploiting the
syntactic structure of the CTL formula. Then, the generated set of constraints
are solved by applying an off-the-shelf Horn constraints solving engine. The
program is said to satisfy the property if and only if the generated set of
constraints has a solution. We demonstrate the practical promises of the method
by applying it on a set of challenging examples. Although our method is based

of determinant one, which in turn can be identified with the locally symmetric
space $X_d:=SL_d(\mathbb{Z})\backslash SL_d(\mathbb{R})/SO_d(\mathbb{R})$.
Equip the latter space with its natural probability measure coming from a Haar
measure on $SL_d(\mathbb{R})$. In 1998, Kleinbock and Margulis established
sharp estimates for the probability that an element of $X_d$ takes a value less
than a given real number $\delta>0$ over the non--zero lattice points
$\mathbb{Z}^d\backslash\{ 0 \}$.
  In this article, these estimates are extended to a large class of probability
measures arising either from the spectral or the Cholesky decomposition of an
element of $\Sigma_d^{++}$. The sharpness of the bounds thus obtained are also
established (up to multiplicative constants) for a subclass of these measures.
  Although of an independent interest, this theory is partly developed here

providing a concise introduction to this topic fitted to our needs, we lay the
theoretical foundations of the study of some manifolds frequently appearing in

energy in ${^{12}{\rm C}}$ is confirmed by a fully microscopic 3$\alpha$
cluster model. Firstly, a GCM (generator coordinate method) calculation is
performed by superposing optimized 2$\alpha$+$\alpha$ THSR
(Tohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-R\""{o}pke) wave functions with the radius-constraint
method. The obtained two excited $0^+$ states above the Hoyle state are
consistent with the recently observed states by experiment. Secondly, a
variational calculation using the single 2$\alpha$+$\alpha$ THSR wave function
orthogonalized to the ground and Hoyle states is made and it also supports the
existence of the $0_3^+$ state obtained by the GCM calculation. The analysis of
the obtained $0_3^+$ state is made by studying its 2$\alpha$-$\alpha$ reduced
width amplitude, its 2$\alpha$ correlation function, and the large monopole
matrix element between this state and the Hoyle state, which shows that this
$0_3^+$ state is a breathing-like excited state of the Hoyle state. This
character of the $0_3^+$ state is very different from the $0_4^+$ state which
seems to have a bent-arm 3$\alpha$ structure.

advantageous mutant or invader individual placed at some node is strictly less
than that of this individual placed in a well-mixed population. This leads the
way to study more robust structures less prone to invasion, contrary to what
happens with the amplifiers of selection where the fixation probability is
increased on average for advantageous invader individuals. A few families of
amplifiers are known, although some effort was required to prove it. Here, we
use computer aided techniques to find an exact analytical expression of the
fixation probability for some graphs of small order (equal to $6$, $8$ and
$10$) proving that selection is effectively reduced for $r > 1$. Some numerical
experiments using Monte Carlo methods are also performed for larger graphs.

focus is on networks governed by $k$-canalizing functions, a recently
introduced class of Boolean functions that contains the well-studied class of
nested canalizing functions. The activities and sensitivity of a function
quantify the impact of input changes on the function output. This paper
generalizes the latter concept to $c$-sensitivity and provides formulas for the
activities and $c$-sensitivity of general $k$-canalizing functions as well as
canalizing functions with more precisely defined structure. A popular measure
for the robustness of a network, the Derrida value, can be expressed as a
weighted sum of the $c$-sensitivities of the governing canalizing functions,
and can also be calculated for a stochastic extension of Boolean networks.
These findings provide a computationally efficient way to obtain Derrida values

temperature at very short time $\tau$ and saturates to
$T_{eff}=T_{eff}(\tau\to\infty)$ at long times; The transition time $t_{trans}$

simplifications that are used to calculate the total internal partition
function. These shortcomings can lead to errors of up to 40 percent or more in
the estimated partition function. These errors carry on to calculations of
thermodynamic quantities. Therefore a more complicated approach has to be
taken.
  Methods. Seven possible simplifications of various complexity are described,
together with advantages and disadvantages of direct summation of experimental
values. These were compared to what we consider the most accurate and most
complete treatment (case 8). Dunham coefficients were determined from
experimental and theoretical energy levels of a number of electronically
excited states of H$_2$ . Both equilibrium and normal hydrogen was taken into
consideration.
  Results. Various shortcomings in existing calculations are demonstrated, and
the reasons for them are explained. New partition functions for equilibrium,
normal, and ortho and para hydrogen are calculated and thermodynamic quantities
are reported for the temperature range 1 - 20000 K. Our results are compared to
previous estimates in the literature. The calculations are not limited to the
ground electronic state, but include all bound and quasi-bound levels of
excited electronic states. Dunham coefficients of these states of H$_2$ are
also reported.
  Conclusions. For most of the relevant astrophysical cases it is strongly
advised to avoid using simplifications, such as a harmonic oscillator and rigid
rotor or ad hoc summation limits of the eigenstates to estimate accurate
partition functions and to be particularly careful when using polynomial fits
to the computed values. Reported internal partition functions and thermodynamic
quantities in the present work are shown to be more accurate than previously
available data.

recording simulations is a challenging task. Integrating the
Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch (LLB) equation can reduce the computational effort to
determine the magnetization dynamics in the vicinity of the Curie temperature.
If one aims that these dynamics coincide with trajectories calculated from the
atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, one has to carefully model required
temperature dependent material functions such as the zero-field equilibrium
magnetization as well as the parallel and normal susceptibilities. We present
an extensive study on how these functions depend on grain size and exchange
interactions. We show that, if the size or the exchange constant of a reference
grain is modified, the material functions can be scaled, according to the
changed Curie temperature, yielding negligible errors. This is shown to be
valid for volume changes of up to $\pm 40$ % and variations of the exchange
constant of up to $\pm10$ %. Besides the temperature dependent material curves,
computed switching probabilities also agree well with probabilities separately
determined for each system. Our study suggest that there is no need to
recalculate the required LLB input functions for each particle. Within the
presented limits it is sufficient to scale them to the Curie temperature of the
altered system.

Big-Bounce is connected to the Universe turning point via a well-defined

be regarded as a paradigm for the generic cosmological model. Finally, we
investigate the origin of the observed cut-off on the cosmological dynamics,

secondary electron emission from that surface. A velvet is a surface that
consists of an array of vertically standing whiskers. The reduction occurs due
to the capture of low-energy, true secondary electrons emitted at the bottom of
the structure and on the sides of the velvet whiskers. We performed numerical
simulations and developed an approximate analytical model that calculates the
net secondary electron emission yield from a velvet surface as a function of
the velvet whisker length and packing density, and the angle of incidence of
primary electrons. We found that to suppress secondary electrons, the following
condition on dimensionless parameters must be met: {\pi}/2 DA tan {\theta} >> 1
where {\theta} is the angle of incidence of the primary electron from the
normal, D is the fraction of surface area taken up by the velvet whisker bases,
and A is the aspect ratio, A {\equiv} h/r, the ratio of height to radius of the
velvet whiskers. We find that velvets available today can reduce the secondary
electron yield by 90% from the value of a flat surface. The values of optimal
velvet whisker packing density that maximally suppresses secondary electron
emission yield are determined as a function of velvet aspect ratio and electron

the Universe and are still forming. They are thus important probes of
cosmological parameters and a host of astrophysical processes. Knowledge of the
dynamics of the pervasive hot gas, which dominates in mass over stars in a
cluster, is a crucial missing ingredient. It can enable new insights into
mechanical energy injection by the central supermassive black hole and the use
of hydrostatic equilibrium for the determination of cluster masses. X-rays from
the core of the Perseus cluster are emitted by the 50 million K diffuse hot
plasma filling its gravitational potential well. The Active Galactic Nucleus of
the central galaxy NGC1275 is pumping jetted energy into the surrounding
intracluster medium, creating buoyant bubbles filled with relativistic plasma.
These likely induce motions in the intracluster medium and heat the inner gas
preventing runaway radiative cooling; a process known as Active Galactic
Nucleus Feedback. Here we report on Hitomi X-ray observations of the Perseus
cluster core, which reveal a remarkably quiescent atmosphere where the gas has
a line-of-sight velocity dispersion of 164+/-10 km/s in a region 30-60 kpc from
the central nucleus. A gradient in the line-of-sight velocity of 150+/-70 km/s
is found across the 60 kpc image of the cluster core. Turbulent pressure
support in the gas is 4% or less of the thermodynamic pressure, with large
scale shear at most doubling that estimate. We infer that total cluster masses
determined from hydrostatic equilibrium in the central regions need little
correction for turbulent pressure.

prediction until now, the triple Higgs coupling can deviate from the SM value
in the physics beyond the SM (BSM). In this paper, the radiative correction to
the triple Higgs coupling is investigated in the minimal extension of the SM by
adding a real gauge singlet scalar. In this model there are two scalars $h$ and
$H$, and both of them are mixing states of the doublet and singlet. Provided
that the mixing angle is set to be zero, namely the SM limit, $h$ is the pure
left-over of the doublet and its behaviour is the same as that of the SM at the
tree level. However the loop corrections can alter $h$-related couplings. In
this SM limit case, the effect of the singlet $H$ may show up in the
$h$-related couplings, especially the triple $h$ coupling. Our numerical
results show that the deviation is sizable. For $\lambda_{\Phi{S}}=1$ (see the
text for definition), the deviation $\delta_{hhh}^{(1)}$ around threshold can
be more than $20\%$ if mass of the new scalar is light. For
$\lambda_{\Phi{S}}=1.5,3$, the deviation $\delta_{hhh}^{(1)}$ can reach above
$30\%$ in the vicinity of threshold. For $\lambda_{\Phi{S}}=-1$, $m_H$ can be
light. The deviation $\delta_{hhh}^{(1)}$ is negative in this case and can be
even $-50\%$ in the threshold enhanced region. The radiative correction for the
$hZZ$ coupling is from the counter-term, which is universal in this model and
always with negative sign. $\delta_{hZZ}^{(1)}$ is independent of the sign of
$\lambda_{\Phi{S}}$ and its typical size is $-0.2\%\sim-2\%$. When combining
$hhh$ and $hZZ$ precision measurements together, parameter space of this model
can be probed well including the sign and size of $\lambda_{\Phi{S}}$.

at the two epochs. The first result, coupled with electron density diagnostics
and compared with published optical and ultraviolet observations, indicates
that most likely in 2012 September the X-rays originate from a very small
fraction of the ejecta, concentrated in very dense clumps. We obtained a fairly
good fit to the September spectrum with a model of plasma in collisional
ionization equilibrium (CIE) with two components; one at a temperature of 0.78
keV, blueshifted by 710-930 km/s, the other at a temperature of 4.5 keV, mostly
contributing to the high-energy continuum. However, we cannot rule out a range
of plasma temperatures between these two extremes. In December, the central
white dwarf (WD) became visible in X-rays. We estimate an effective temperature
of about 680,000 K, consistent with a WD mass ~1.1 M(sol). The WD flux is
modulated with the orbital period, indicating high inclination, and two
quasi-periodic modulations with hour timescales were also observed. No hot
plasma component with temperature above 0.5 keV was observed in December, and
the blue-shifted component cooled to kT~0.45 keV. Additionally, new emission
lines due to a much cooler plasma appeared, which were not observed two months
earlier. We estimate abundances and yields of elements in the nova wind that
cannot be measured in the optical spectra and confirm the high Ne abundance
previously derived for this nova. We also find high abundance of Al, 230 times
the solar value, consistently with the prediction that ONe novae contribute to
at least 1/3rd of the Galactic yield of Al(26).

For a weak impurity-boson attractive interactionattraction with the condensate,
the two impurities form two polarons that interact through a weak Yukawa
attraction mediated by virtual excitations. For a resonant attraction with the
condensate, the exchanged excitation becomes a real boson and the mediated
interaction changes to a strong Efimov attraction that can bind the two

(RHESSI) terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs) is performed in association with
World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) sources and very low frequency
(VLF) sferics recorded at Duke University. RHESSI clock offset is evaluated and
found to experience changes on the 5 August 2005 and 21 October 2013, based on
the analysis of TGF-WWLLN matches. The clock offsets were found for all three
periods of observations with standard deviations less than 100 {\mu}s. This
result opens the possibility for the precise comparative analyses of RHESSI
TGFs with the other types of data (WWLLN, radio measurements, etc.) In case of
multiple-peak TGFs, WWLLN detections are observed to be simultaneous with the
last TGF peak for all 16 cases of multipeak RHESSI TGFs simultaneous with WWLLN
sources. VLF magnetic field sferics were recorded for two of these 16 events at
Duke University. These radio measurements also attribute VLF sferics to the
second peak of the double TGFs, exhibiting no detectable radio emission during
the first TGF peak. Possible scenarios explaining these observations are
proposed. Double (multipeak) TGFs could help to distinguish between the VLF
radio emission radiated by the recoil currents in the +IC leader channel and
the VLF emission from the TGF producing electrons.

the 3D reconstruction of a single, rigidly moving object seen by a static
camera, or a static and rigid scene observed by a moving camera --in both cases
there are only one relative rigid motion involved. Recent progress have
extended SFM to the areas of {multi-body SFM} (where there are {multiple rigid}
relative motions in the scene), as well as {non-rigid SFM} (where there is a
single non-rigid, deformable object or scene). Along this line of thinking,
there is apparently a missing gap of ""multi-body non-rigid SFM"", in which the
task would be to jointly reconstruct and segment multiple 3D structures of the
multiple, non-rigid objects or deformable scenes from images. Such a multi-body
non-rigid scenario is common in reality (e.g. two persons shaking hands,
multi-person social event), and how to solve it represents a natural
{next-step} in SFM research. By leveraging recent results of subspace
clustering, this paper proposes, for the first time, an effective framework for
multi-body NRSFM, which simultaneously reconstructs and segments each 3D
trajectory into their respective low-dimensional subspace. Under our
formulation, 3D trajectories for each non-rigid structure can be well
approximated with a sparse affine combination of other 3D trajectories from the
same structure (self-expressiveness). We solve the resultant optimization with
the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed framework through extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real data sequences. Our method clearly outperforms other
alternative methods, such as first clustering the 2D feature tracks to groups
and then doing non-rigid reconstruction in each group or first conducting 3D
reconstruction by using single subspace assumption and then clustering the 3D
trajectories into groups.

performance can be provided by a CAT XGS on an X-ray-Surveyor-type mission. CAT
gratings combine the advantages of blazed reflection gratings (high efficiency,
use of higher diffraction orders) with those of transmission gratings (low
mass, relaxed alignment and temperature requirements, transparent at high
energies) with minimal mission resource demands. They are high-efficiency
blazed transmission gratings that consist of freestanding, ultra-high
aspect-ratio grating bars made from SOI wafers using anisotropic dry and wet
etch techniques. Blazing is achieved through reflection off grating bar
sidewalls. Silicon is well matched to the soft x-ray band, and existing silicon
CAT gratings exceed 30% absolute diffraction efficiency, with clear paths for
improvement. CAT gratings coated with heavier elements allow extension of the
CAT grating principle to higher energies and larger angles, enabling higher
resolving power at shorter wavelengths. We show x-ray data from CAT gratings
coated with platinum using atomic layer deposition, and demonstrate blazing to
higher energies and much larger blaze angles than possible with silicon. We
measure resolving power of a CAT XGS consisting of a Wolter-I focusing mirror

which one of the atoms is specially chosen as a probe atom that is initially
prepared in its excited state or is continuously driven by a laser field. Short
chains are considered, composed of only three and five atoms. The analysis
demonstrate the importance of the inter atomic dipole-dipole interaction which
may lead to a collective ordering of the emission along some specific
directions. We examine the conditions under which the radiative modes available
for the emission are only those contained inside a cone centered about the
inter atomic axis. Particular interest is in achieving the one-way emission
along the inter atomic axis, either into left (backward) or right (forward)
direction, which is referred to as a mirror-like behavior of the atomic chain.
A direction dependent quantity called the directivity function, which
determines how effective the system is in concentrating the radiation into a
given direction, is introduced. We show that the function depends crucially on
the distance between the atoms and find that there is a threshold for the inter
atomic distances above which a strongly directional emission can be achieved.
The one-sided emission as a manifestation of the mirror-like behavior and a
highly focused emission along the inter atomic axis as a characteristic of a
single-mode cavity are demonstrated to occur in the stationary field. Below the
threshold the directivity function is spherically symmetric. However, we find
that the population can be trapped in one of the atoms, and sometimes in all
atoms indicating that at these small distances the system decays to a state for
which there are no radiative modes available for emission.

amount of literature has addressed spatio--temporal models, with Spatial
Dynamic Panel Data (SDPD) being widely investigated and applied. In real data
applications, checking the validity of the theoretical assumptions underlying
the SDPD models is essential but sometimes difficult. At other times, the
assumptions are clearly violated. For example, the spatial matrix is assumed to
be known but it may actually be unknown and needs to be estimated. In such
cases, the performance of the SDPD model's estimator is generally affected.
Motivated by such considerations, we propose a new model (called stationary
SDPD) and a new estimation procedure based on simple and clear assumptions that
can be easily checked with real data. The new model is highly adaptive, and the
estimation procedure has a rate of convergence that is not affected by the
dimension of the time series (under general assumptions), notwithstanding the
relatively high number of parameters to be estimated. The new model may be used
to represent a wide class of multivariate time series, not necessarily
spatio-temporal. So, it can be used as a valid alternative to vector
autoregressive (VAR) models with two immediate advantages: i) a faster rate of
convergence of the estimation procedure and ii) the possibility of estimating
the model even when the dimension is higher than the time series length,
overcoming the curse of dimensionality typical of the VAR models. The
simulation study shows that the new estimation procedure performs well compared
with the classic alternative procedure, even when the spatial matrix is unknown
and therefore estimated.

(MVs), showing a highly mobile and anisotropic motion, is possible only at low
temperatures around 70 K or below where the thermal activity is greatly
suppressed. At room temperature, the motion of a MV is sixteen orders faster
than that in graphene, because of the low diffusion barrier of 0.3 eV. Built-in
strain associated with the vacancies extends far along the zigzag direction
while attenuating rapidly along the armchair direction. We reveal new features
of the motion of di-vacancies (DVs) in phosphorene via multiple
dissociation-recombination processes of vacancies owing to a small energy cost
of ~ 1.05 eV for the splitting of a DV into two MVs. Furthermore, we find that
uniaxial tensile strain along the zigzag direction can promote the motion of
MVs, while the tensile strain along the armchair direction has the opposite
effect. These itinerant features of vacancies, rooted in the unique puckering
structure facilitating bond reorganization, enable phosphorene to be a bright
new opportunity to broaden the knowledge of the evolution of vacancies, and a
proper control of the exceedingly active and anisotropic movement of the
vacancies should be critical for applications based on phosphorene.

produces a non trivial (different from the constant function one) limiting

Inspired from the dogbone structure, the nano strain-amplifier consists of a
nano thin frame released from the substrate, where nanowires were formed at the
centre of the frame. Analytical and numerical results indicated that a nano
strain-amplifier significantly increases the strain induced into a free
standing nanowire, resulting in a large change in their electrical conductance.
The proposed structure was demonstrated in p-type cubic silicon carbide
nanowires fabricated using a top down process. The experimental data showed
that the nano strain-amplifier can enhance the sensitivity of SiC strain

dissect this dust into two distinct components. The compact component, a very
thin disk, appears to be connected to the maser disk and the extended one,

three-body recombination contribution to the n=7 Balmer line intensity.
  During density ramps, the plasma at the target detaches as inferred from a
drop in ion current to the target. At the same time the Balmer $6\rightarrow2$
and $7\rightarrow2$ line emission near the target is dominated by
recombination. As the core density increases further, the density and
recombination rate are rising all along the outer leg to the x-point while
remaining highest at the target. Even at the highest core densities accessed
(Greenwald fraction 0.7) the peaks in recombination and density may have moved
not more than a few cm poloidally away from the target which is different to
other, higher density tokamaks, where both the peak in recombination and
density continue to move towards the x-point as the core density is increased.
  The inferred magnitude of recombination is small compared to the target ion
current at the time detachment (particle flux drop) starts at the target.
However, recombination may be having more localized effects (to a flux tube)
which we cannot discern at this time. Later, at the highest densities achieved,
the total recombination does reach levels similar to the particle flux.

oscillations that form in the proximity of strong gradients. The solution to
this problem is still an active field of research as no general cure has been
found yet. In this paper, we tackle this issue by presenting a dynamically
adaptive viscosity based on a residual-based sub-grid scale model that has the
following properties: $(i)$ it removes the spurious oscillations in the
proximity of strong wave fronts while preserving the overall accuracy and
sharpness of the solution. This is possible because of the residual-based
definition of the dynamic diffusion coefficient. $(ii)$ For coarse grids, it
prevents energy from building up at small wave-numbers. $(iii)$ The model has
no tunable parameter. Our interest in the shallow water equations is tied to
the simulation of coastal inundation, where a careful handling of the
transition between dry and wet surfaces is particularly challenging for
high-order Galerkin approximations. In this paper, we extend to a unified
continuous/discontinuous Galerkin (CG/DG) framework a very simple, yet
effective wetting and drying algorithm originally designed for DG [Xing, Zhang,
Shu (2010)]. We show its effectiveness for problems in one and two dimensions
on domains of increasing characteristic lengths varying from centimeters to
kilometers. Finally, to overcome the time-step restriction incurred by the
high-order Galerkin approximation, we advance the equations forward in time via
a three stage, second order explicit-first-stage, singly diagonally implicit
Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) time integration scheme. Via ESDIRK, we are able to
preserve numerical stability for an advective CFL number 10 times larger than

cost of high off-chip bandwidth requirements. This I/O bottleneck limits the
observability, a problem becoming more severe as more functionality is
integrated on-chip. In this paper, we present DiaSys, an MPSoC diagnosis system
with the potential to replace today's tracing systems. Its main idea is to
partially execute the analysis of observation data on the chip; in consequence,
more information and less data is sent to the attached host PC. With DiaSys,
the data analysis is performed by the diagnosis application. Its input are
events, which are generated by observation hardware at interesting points in
the program execution (like a function call). Its outputs are events with
higher information density. The event transformation is modeled as dataflow
application. For execution, it is mapped in part to dedicated and distributed
on-chip components, and in part to the host PC; the off-chip boundary is
transparent to the developer of the diagnosis application. We implement DiaSys
as extension to an existing SoC with four tiles and a mesh network running on
an FPGA platform. Two usage examples confirm that DiaSys is flexible enough to
replace a tracing system, while significantly lowering the off-chip bandwidth
requirements. In our examples, the debugging of a race-condition bug, and the
creation of a lock contention profile, we see a reduction of trace bandwidth of
more than three orders of magnitude, compared to a full trace created by a
common tracing system.

several variants of the max-sum diversification problem which, in its most
basic form, is as follows: Given n points p_1,...,p_n in R^d and an integer k,
select k points such that the average Euclidean distance between these points
is maximized. This problem commonly appears in information retrieval and
web-search in order to select a diverse set of points from the input. In this
context, it has recently received a lot of attention.
  We present new techniques to analyze natural local search algorithms. This
leads to a (1-O(1/k))-approximation for distances of negative type, even
subject to any matroid constraint of rank k, in time O(n k^2 log k), when
assuming that distance evaluations and calls to the independence oracle are
constant time. Negative type distances include as special cases Euclidean
distances and many further natural distances. Our result easily transforms into
a PTAS and improves on the only previously known PTAS for this setting, which
relies on convex optimization techniques in an n-dimensional space and is
impractical for large data sets. In contrast, our procedure has an (optimal)
linear dependence on n.
  Using generalized exchange properties of matroid intersection, we show that a
PTAS can be obtained for matroid intersection constraints as well. Moreover,
our techniques, being based on local search, are conceptually simple and allow
for various extensions. In particular, we get asymptotically optimal
O(1)-approximations when combining the classic dispersion function with a
monotone submodular objective, which is a very common class of functions to

learning has been proposed to predict the Reynolds stress anisotropy of a given
flow based on high fidelity data from closely related flows. In this work, the
closeness of different flows is investigated to assess the prediction
confidence a priori. Specifically, the Mahalanobis distance and the kernel
density estimation (KDE) technique are used as metrics to quantify the distance
between flow data sets in feature space. The flow over periodic hills at
Re=10595 is used as the test set and seven flows with different configurations
are individually used as training set. The results show that the prediction
error of the Reynolds stress anisotropy is positively correlated with
Mahalanobis distance and KDE distance, demonstrating that both extrapolation
metrics can be used to estimate the prediction confidence a priori. A
quantitative comparison using correlation coefficients shows that the
Mahalanobis distance is less accurate in estimating the prediction confidence
than KDE distance. The extrapolation metrics introduced in this work and the
corresponding analysis provide an approach to aid in the choice of the data

flying-by stars in the Galactic field and can be perturbated into highly
eccentric orbits (e ~ 0.99). For such systems tidal interactions at close
pericenter passages can lead to orbit circularization and possibly mass
transfer, consequently producing X-Ray binaries without the need for common
envelope. We test this scenario for the case of Black Hole Low-Mass X-Ray
Binaries (BH LMXBs) by performing a population synthesis from primordial
binaries with numerical treatment of random stellar encounters. We test various
models for the threshold pericenter distance under which tidal forces cause
circularization. We estimate that fly-by interactions can produce a current

multi-group neutrino hydrodynamics simulations of core-collapse supernovae of
progenitors with 11.2 Msun, 20 Msun, and 27 Msun. GW emission in the
pre-explosion phase strongly depends on whether the post-shock flow is
dominated by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) or convection and
differs considerably from 2D models. SASI activity produces a strong signal
component below 250 Hz through asymmetric mass motions in the gain layer and a
non-resonant coupling to the proto-neutron star (PNS). Both convection- and
SASI-dominated models show GW emission above 250 Hz, but with considerably
lower amplitudes than in 2D. This is due to a different excitation mechanism
for high-frequency l=2 motions in the PNS surface, which are predominantly
excited by PNS convection in 3D. Resonant excitation of high-frequency surface
g-modes in 3D by mass motions in the gain layer is suppressed compared to 2D
because of smaller downflow velocities and a lack of high-frequency variability
in the downflows. In the exploding 20 Msun model, shock revival results in
enhanced low-frequency emission due to a change of the preferred scale of the
convective eddies in the PNS convection zone. Estimates of the expected excess
power in two frequency bands suggests that second-generation detectors will
only be able to detect very nearby events, but that third-generation detectors
could distinguish SASI- and convection-dominated models at distances of ~10
kpc.

single-field inflation, we find that the subtraction term is suppressed by an

the subtraction term long enough beyond horizon crossing, the regularized power
spectrum tends to the ""bare"" power spectrum. This study justifies the use of

quantum chromodynamics from an U(1) Higgs model including fermions, if the
emergent theory is Lorentz invariant. In this model, the vacuum becomes
anisotropic, and a fermion created on a triplet of spin-one vacua acquires
degeneracy analogous to the color degrees of freedom. The Nambu-Goldstone
bosons originating from the breakdown of rotational symmetry provide the quasi
fermions with SU(3)$\times$U(1) effective interactions, which are interpretable
as mediated by gluons and photons. The confinement of quasi quarks as well as
that of Nambu-Goldstone gluons follow from the Lorentz invariance of the
emergent theory.

Coding (DVC) algorithm using Local Rank Transform (LRT). The encoder computes
LRT by considering selected neighborhood pixels of Wyner-Ziv frame. The ranks
from the modified LRT are merged, and their positions are entropy coded and
sent to the decoder. In addition, means of each block of Wyner-Ziv frame are
also transmitted to assist motion estimation. Using these measurements, the
decoder generates side information (SI) by implementing motion estimation and
compensation in LRT domain. An iterative algorithm is executed on SI using LRT
to reconstruct the Wyner-Ziv frame. Experimental results show that the coding
efficiency of our codec is close to the efficiency of pixel domain distributed
video coders based on Low-Density Parity Check and Accumulate (LDPCA) or turbo
codes, with less encoder complexity.

same two-type heterogeneous multiprocessor scheduling problem for a real-time
taskset with hard constraints. Our formulations are based on a global
scheduling scheme and a fluid model. The first formulation is a mixed-integer
nonlinear program, since the scheduling problem is intuitively considered as an
assignment problem. However, by changing the scheduling problem to first
determine a task workload partition and then to find the execution order of all
tasks, the computation time can be significantly reduced. Specifically, the
workload partitioning problem can be formulated as a continuous nonlinear
program for a system with continuous operating frequency, and as a continuous
linear program for a practical system with a discrete speed level set. The task
ordering problem can be solved by an algorithm with a complexity that is linear
in the total number of tasks. The work is evaluated against existing global
energy/feasibility optimal workload allocation formulations. The results
illustrate that our algorithms are both feasibility optimal and energy optimal
for both implicit and constrained deadline tasksets. Specifically, our
algorithm can achieve up to 40% energy saving for some simulated tasksets with
constrained deadlines. The benefit of our formulation compared with existing
work is that our algorithms can solve a more general class of scheduling
problems due to incorporating a scheduling dynamic model in the formulations
and allowing for a time-varying speed profile. Moreover, our algorithms can be
applied to both online and offline scheduling schemes.

  International Conference on Mathematical Problems in Engineering, Aerospace

heat, defined as that form of energy that is transferred as a result of a
temperature difference and (ii) the nature of the intermolecular potentials
that induces both thermal energy flow and the temperature profile at the steady
state for a 1-D lattice chain. It is found that the standard presuppositions of
people like Benofy and Quay (BQ) following Joseph Fourier do not obtain for at
least a certain specified regime of intermolecular potential parameters related
to harmonic (quadratic) potentials for nearest neighbor interactions. For these
harmonic potentials, it appears from the simulation results that steady state
solutions exist utilizing non-synthetic thermostats that couple not just the
two particles at the extreme ends of the lattice chain, but to a control volume
of $N$ particles located at either ends of the chain that does not accord with
the unique analytical solutions that obtains for single particle thermostatting
at the ends of the lattice with a different thermostatting algorithm that
utilizes coupling coefficients. If the method used here is considered a more
""realistic"" or feasible model of the physical reality, then a re-evaluation of
some aspects of the standard theoretical methodology is warranted since the
standard model solution profile does not accord with the simulation temperature
profile determined here for this related model. We also note that the
sinusoidal temperature profile generated suggests that thermal integrated
circuits with several thermal P-N junctions may be constructed, opening a way
to create more complex thermal transistor circuits. A stationary principle is
proposed for regions that violate the Fourier principle $\mathbf{J_q.}\nabla T
\le 0 $, where $\mathbf{J_q}$ is the heat current vector and $T$ the
temperature.
