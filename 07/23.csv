considering wavevectors with complex components. In this way, complex band
structure describes both the bulk-propagating states from conventional band
structure and the evanescent states that grow or decay from one unit cell to
the next. Even though these latter states are excluded by translational
symmetry, they become important when translational symmetry is broken via, for
example, a surface or impurity.
  Many studies over the last 80 years have directly or indirectly developed
complex band structure for an impressive range of applications, but very few
discuss its fundamentals or compare its various results. In this work we build
upon these previous efforts to expose the physical foundation of complex band
structure, which mathematically implies the existence of complex band
structure. We find that a material's static and dynamic electronic structure
are both completely described by complex band structure. Furthermore, we show
that complex band structure reflects the minimal, intrinsic information
contained in the material's Hamiltonian. These realizations then provide a
context for discussing, comparing, and unifying the different formulations and
applications of complex band structure that have been developed over the years.
Ultimately, this discussion introduces the idea of examining the amount of
information contained in a material's Hamiltonian so that we can find and
exploit the minimal information necessary for understanding a material's
properties.

an inflationary quintessential model whose inflationary stage was described by
a Higgs type potential and the quintessential phase was responsible due to an
exponential potential. Additionally, the model predicted a nonsingular universe
in past which was geodesically past incomplete. Further, it was also found that
the model is in agreement with the Planck 2013 data when running is allowed.
But, this model was found to be unsuccessful with Planck 2015 data with or
without running. However, in this sequel we propose a family of models runs by
a single parameter $alpha in [0, 1]$ which proposes another ""inflationary
quintessential model"" where the inflation and the quintessence regimes are
respectively described by a power law potential and a cosmological constant.
The model is also nonsingular although geodesically past incomplete as in the
cited model. However, the present one is found to be more simple in compared to
the previous model and it is in excellent agreement with the observational
data. We note that unlike the previous model which matched only with Planck
2013 data in presence of running, a large number of the models of this family
with $alpha in [0,1/2)$ matches with both Planck 2013 and Planck 2015 data

paves a way to probabilistic numerical methods for nonlinear parabolic PDEs.
The majority of the results on the numerical methods for FBSDEs relies on the
global Lipschitz assumption, which is not satisfied for a number of important
cases such as the Fisher--KPP or the FitzHugh--Nagumo equations. Furthermore,
it has been shown in \cite{LionnetReisSzpruch2015} that for BSDEs with monotone
drivers having polynomial growth in the primary variable $y$, only the
(sufficiently) implicit schemes converge. But these require an additional
computational effort compared to explicit schemes.
  This article develops a general framework that allows the analysis, in a
systematic fashion, of the integrability properties, convergence and
qualitative properties (e.g.~comparison theorem) for whole families of modified
explicit schemes. The framework yields the convergence of some modified
explicit scheme with the same rate as implicit schemes and with the
computational cost of the standard explicit scheme.
  To illustrate our theory, we present several classes of easily implementable
modified explicit schemes that can computationally outperform the implicit one
and preserve the qualitative properties of the solution to the BSDE. These
classes fit into our developed framework and are tested in computational
experiments.

the ground state is antiferromagnetically ordered for any value of the on-site
interaction $U$, we can identify a hidden critical point $U_{\rm Mott}$, above
which a finite BCS pairing is stabilized in the wave function. The existence of
this point is reminiscent of the Mott transition in the paramagnetic sector and
determines a separation between a Slater insulator (at small values of $U$),
where magnetism induces a potential energy gain, and a Mott insulator (at large
values of $U$), where magnetic correlations drive a kinetic energy gain. Most
importantly, the existence of $U_{\rm Mott}$ has crucial consequences when
doping the system: We observe a tendency to phase separation into a hole-rich
and a hole-poor region only when doping the Slater insulator, while the system
is uniform by doping the Mott insulator. Superconducting correlations are
clearly observed above $U_{\rm Mott}$, leading to the characteristic dome
structure in doping. Furthermore, we show that the energy gain due to the

Then we calculate the entanglement entropy in the non-interacting $p$-form
theory in $2p+2$ dimensional Euclidean flat background with an $S^{2p}$
entangling surface. The universal term of the entanglement entropy in the
non-interacting $p$-form theory is determined in terms of the universal terms
of the non-interacting zero-form theory. We also prove the strong subadditivity
in the non-interacting theory with the non-trivial centers. Finally, we
calculate the mutual information with centers in two-dimensional conformal
field theory. The result shows that the mutual information is independent of
the choice of centers.

when consecutive edges with different colors are traversed. The value of the
traversal cost depends only on the colors of the traversed edges. This concept
leads to two global cost measures, namely the \emph{reload cost} and the
\emph{changeover cost}, that have been studied in the literature and have
various applications in telecommunications, transportation networks, and energy
distribution networks. Previous work focused on problems with an edge-colored
graph being part of the input. In this paper, we formulate and focus on two
pairs of problems that aim to find an edge coloring of a graph so as to
minimize the reload and changeover costs. The first pair of problems aims to
find a proper edge coloring so that the reload/changeover cost of a set of
paths is minimized. The second pair of problems aim to find a proper edge
coloring and a spanning tree so that the reload/changeover cost is minimized.
We present several hardness results as well as polynomial-time solvable special

simulation times, the heat flux ""quasi-saturates"" without any strong dependence
on collisionality, and with the turbulence dominated by streamer-like radially

grow slowly until much later times, eventually leading to a new saturated state

scaling of the energy confinement in MAST. We outline an explanation of this

magnetic field are coronal loops that are smooth and laminar and
prominences/filaments that are strongly sheared. These two features would seem
to be quite unrelated in that the loops are near their minimum-energy
current-free state, whereas filaments are regions of high magnetic stress and
intense electric currents. We argue that, in fact, these two features are
inextricably linked in that both are due to a single process: the injection of
magnetic helicity into the corona by photospheric motions and the subsequent
evolution of this helicity by coronal reconnection. In this paper, we present
numerical simulations of the response of a \citet{Parker72} corona to
photospheric driving motions that have varying degrees of helicity preference.
We obtain four main conclusions: 1) in agreement with the helicity condensation
model of \citet{Antiochos13}, the inverse cascade of helicity by magnetic
reconnection results in the formation of prominences/filaments localized about
polarity inversion lines (PILs); 2) this same process removes most structure
from the rest of the corona, resulting in smooth and laminar coronal loops; 3)
the amount of remnant tangling in coronal loops is inversely dependent on the
net helicity injected by the driving motions; and 4) the structure of the solar
corona depends only on the helicity preference of the driving motions and not
on their detailed time dependence. We discuss the implications of our results
for high-resolution observations of the corona.

ALMA SPECtroscopic Survey in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (UDF), the
cosmological deep field that has the deepest multi-wavelength data available.
Our overarching goal is to obtain an unbiased census of molecular gas and dust
continuum emission in high-redshift (z$>$0.5) galaxies. The $\sim$1$'$ region
covered within the UDF was chosen to overlap with the deepest available imaging
from HST. Our ALMA observations consist of full frequency scans in band 3
(84-115 GHz) and band 6 (212-272 GHz) at approximately uniform line sensitivity
($L'_{\rm CO}\sim$2$\times$10$^{9}$ K km/s pc$^2$), and continuum noise levels
of 3.8 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ and 12.7 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, respectively. The
molecular surveys cover the different rotational transitions of the CO
molecule, leading to essentially full redshift coverage. The [CII] emission
line is also covered at redshifts $6.0<z<8.0$. We present a customized
algorithm to identify line candidates in the molecular line scans, and quantify
our ability to recover artificial sources from our data. Based on whether
multiple CO lines are detected, and whether optical spectroscopic redshifts as
well as optical counterparts exist, we constrain the most likely line
identification. We report 10 (11) CO line candidates in the 3mm (1mm) band, and
our statistical analysis shows that $<$4 of these (in each band) are likely
spurious. Less than 1/3 of the total CO flux in the low-J CO line candidates
are from sources that are not associated with an optical/NIR counterpart. We
also present continuum maps of both the band 3 and band 6 observations. The
data presented here form the basis of a number of dedicated studies that are
presented in subsequent papers.

continuum map based on ASPECS, the ALMA Spectroscopic Survey in the Hubble
Ultra Deep Field. In the 1 arcmin$^2$ covered by ASPECS we detect nine sources
at $>3.5\sigma$ significance at 1.2-mm. Our ALMA--selected sample has a median
redshift of $z=1.6\pm0.4$, with only one galaxy detected at z$>$2 within the
survey area. This value is significantly lower than that found in millimeter
samples selected at a higher flux density cut-off and similar frequencies. Most
galaxies have specific star formation rates similar to that of main sequence
galaxies at the same epoch, and we find median values of stellar mass and star
formation rates of $4.0\times10^{10}\ M_\odot$ and $\sim40~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$,
respectively. Using the dust emission as a tracer for the ISM mass, we derive
depletion times that are typically longer than 300 Myr, and we find molecular
gas fractions ranging from $\sim$0.1 to 1.0. As noted by previous studies,
these values are lower than using CO--based ISM estimates by a factor $\sim$2.
The 1\,mm number counts (corrected for fidelity and completeness) are in
agreement with previous studies that were typically restricted to brighter
sources. With our individual detections only, we recover $55\pm4\%$ of the
extragalactic background light (EBL) at 1.2 mm measured by the Planck
satellite, and we recover $80\pm7\%$ of this EBL if we include the bright end
of the number counts and additional detections from stacking. The stacked
contribution is dominated by galaxies at $z\sim1-2$, with stellar masses of
(1-3)$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$. For the first time, we are able to
characterize the population of galaxies that dominate the EBL at 1.2 mm.

on the CO luminosity function and the evolution of the cosmic molecular gas
density as a function of redshift up to $z\sim 4.5$. This study is based on
galaxies that have been solely selected through their CO emission and not
through any other property. In all of the redshift bins the ASPECS measurements
reach the predicted `knee' of the CO luminosity function (around
$5\times10^{9}$ K km/s pc$^2$). We find clear evidence of an evolution in the
CO luminosity function with respect to $z\sim 0$, with more CO luminous
galaxies present at $z\sim 2$. The observed galaxies at $z\sim 2$ also appear
more gas-rich than predicted by recent semi-analytical models. The comoving
cosmic molecular gas density within galaxies as a function of redshift shows a
factor 3-10 drop from $z \sim 2$ to $z \sim 0$ (with significant error bars),
and possibly a decline at $z>3$. This trend is similar to the observed
evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density. The latter therefore
appears to be at least partly driven by the increased availability of molecular
gas reservoirs at the peak of cosmic star formation ($z\sim2$).

ALMA Spectroscopic Survey (ASPECS) that targets a $\sim1$ arcmin$^2$ region in
the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF), a blind survey of CO emission (tracing
molecular gas) in the 3mm and 1mm bands. Of a total of 1302 galaxies in the
field, 56 have spectroscopic redshifts and correspondingly well-defined
physical properties. Among these, 11 have infrared luminosities
$L_{\rm{}IR}>10^{11}$ L$_\odot$, i.e. a detection in CO emission was expected.
Out these, 7 are detected at various significance in CO, and 4 are undetected
in CO emission. In the CO-detected sources, we find CO excitation conditions
that are lower than typically found in starburst/SMG/QSO environments. We use
the CO luminosities (including limits for non-detections) to derive molecular
gas masses. We discuss our findings in context of previous molecular gas
observations at high redshift (star-formation law, gas depletion times, gas
fractions): The CO-detected galaxies in the UDF tend to reside on the
low-$L_{\rm{}IR}$ envelope of the scatter in the $L_{\rm{}IR}-L'_{\rm{}CO}$
relation, but exceptions exist. For the CO-detected sources, we find an average
depletion time of $\sim$ 1 Gyr, with significant scatter. The average
molecular-to-stellar mass ratio ($M_{\rm{}H2}$/$M_*$) is consistent with
earlier measurements of main sequence galaxies at these redshifts, and again
shows large variations among sources. In some cases, we also measure dust
continuum emission. On average, the dust-based estimates of the molecular gas
are a factor $\sim$2-5$\times$ smaller than those based on CO. Accounting for
detections as well as non-detections, we find large diversity in the molecular
gas properties of the high-redshift galaxies covered by ASPECS.

dropout galaxies at $z>6$ using ASPECS, our ALMA Spectroscopic Survey in the

range $212-272$ GHz, encompass approximately the range $6<z<8$ for [CII] line
emission and reach a limiting luminosity of L$_{\rm
[CII]}\sim$(1.6-2.5)$\times$10$^{8}$ L$_{\odot}$. We identify fourteen [CII]
line emitting candidates in this redshift range with significances $>$4.5
$\sigma$, two of which correspond to blind detections with no optical
counterparts. At this significance level, our statistical analysis shows that
about 60\% of our candidates are expected to be spurious. For one of our
blindly selected [CII] line candidates, we tentatively detect the CO(6-5) line
in our parallel 3-mm line scan. None of the line candidates are individually
detected in the 1.2 mm continuum. A stack of all [CII] candidates results in a
tentative detection with $S_{1.2mm}=14\pm5\mu$Jy. This implies a dust-obscured
star formation rate (SFR) of $(3\pm1)$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. We find that the
two highest--SFR objects have candidate [CII] lines with luminosities that are
consistent with the low-redshift $L_{\rm [CII]}$ vs. SFR relation. The other
candidates have significantly higher [CII] luminosities than expected from
their UV--based SFR. At the current sensitivity it is unclear whether the
majority of these sources are intrinsically bright [CII] emitters, or spurious
sources. If only one of our line candidates was real (a scenario greatly
favored by our statistical analysis), we find a source density for [CII]
emitters at $6<z<8$ that is significantly higher than predicted by current
models and some extrapolations from galaxies in the local universe.

a blind, deep survey for specrtal line emission from high redshift galaxies
using ALMA (the 'ASPECS' survey). In the 99 GHz band, the mean brightness will
be dominated by rotational transitions of CO from intermediate and high
redshift galaxies. In the 242GHz band, the emission could be a combination of
higher order CO lines, and possibly [CII] 158$\mu$m line emission from very
high redshift galaxies ($z \sim 6$ to 7). The mean line surface brightness is a
quantity that is relevant to measurements of spectral distortions of the cosmic
microwave background, and as a potential tool for studying large-scale
structures in the early Universe using intensity mapping. While the cosmic
volume and the number of detections are admittedly small, this pilot survey
provides a direct measure of the mean line surface brightness, independent of
conversion factors, excitation, or other galaxy formation model assumptions.
The mean surface brightness in the 99GHZ band is: $T_B = 0.94\pm 0.09$ $\mu$K.
In the 242GHz band, the mean brightness is: $T_B = 0.55\pm 0.033$ $\mu$K. These
should be interpreted as lower limits on the average sky signal, since we only
include lines detected individually in the blind survey, while in a low
resolution intensity mapping experiment, there will also be the summed
contribution from lower luminosity galaxies that cannot be detected
individually in the current blind survey.

show that for a range of parameters close to this transition/crossover point
the dynamics of the finite system displays pronounced metastability, i.e., the
system relaxes first to long-lived metastable states, before eventual
relaxation to the true stationary state. From the spectral properties of the
quantum master operator we characterise the low-dimensional manifold of
metastable states, which are shown to be probability mixtures of two,
paramagnetic and ferromagnetic, metastable phases. We also show that for long
times the dynamics can be approximated by a classical stochastic dynamics
between the metastable phases that is directly related to the intermittent

enables the design of new materials. In the case of materials for application
in radiation environments, correlating radiation tolerance with fundamental
structural features of a material enables materials discovery. Here, we use a
machine learning model to examine the factors that govern amorphization
resistance in the complex oxide pyrochlore ($A_2B_2$O$_7$). We examine the
fidelity of predictions based on cation radii and electronegativities, the
oxygen positional parameter, and the energetics of disordering and amorphizing
the material. No one factor alone adequately predicts amorphization resistance.
We find that, when multiple families of pyrochlores (with different B cations)
are considered, radii and electronegativities provide the best prediction but
when the machine learning model is restricted to only the $B$=Ti pyrochlores,
the energetics of disordering and amorphization are optimal. This work provides
new insight into the factors that govern the amorphization susceptibility and
highlights the ability of machine learning approaches to generate that insight.

antiferromagnets to the longitudinal order-parameter fluctuations, and the
resulting nonanalytic behavior of the longitudinal susceptibility. In classical
magnets it is well known that long-range correlations induced by the magnons
lead to a singular wave-number dependence of the form $1/k^{4-d}$ in all
dimensions 2<d<4, for both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. At zero
temperature we find a profound difference between the two cases. Consistent
with naive power counting, the longitudinal susceptibility in a quantum
antiferromagnet scales as $k^{d-3}$ for 1<d<3, whereas in a quantum ferromagnet
the analogous result, $k^{d-2}$, is absent due to a zero scaling function. This
absence of a nonanalyticity in the longitudinal susceptibility is due to the
lack of magnon number fluctuations in the ground state of a quantum
ferromagnet; correlation functions that are sensitive to other fluctuations do
exhibit the behavior predicted by simple power counting. Also of interest is
the dynamical behavior as expressed in the longitudinal part of the dynamical
structure factor, which is directly measurable via neutron scattering. For both
ferromagnets and antiferromagnets there is a logarithmic singularity at the
magnon frequency with a prefactor that vanishes as $T\to 0$. In the
antiferromagnetic case there also is a nonzero contribution at T=0 that is
missing for ferromagnets. Magnon damping due to quenched disorder restores the
expected scaling behavior of the longitudinal susceptibility in the
ferromagnetic case; it scales as $k^{d-2}$ if the order parameter is not
conserved, or as $k^d$ if it is. Detailed predictions are made for both two-
and three-dimensional systems at both T=0 and in the limit of low temperatures,
and the physics behind the various nonanalytic behaviors is discussed.

analyse the dependance of Coulomb-breakup calculations on the projectile
description in both its initial bound state and its continuum. Our calculations
depend not only on the Asymptotic Normalisation Coefficient (ANC) of the 15C

proposed by Summers and Nunes [Phys. Rev. C 78, 011601 (2008), ibid. 78, 069908

comparison of calculations to breakup data. Fortunately, the sensitivity to the
continuum description can be absorbed in a normalisation constant obtained by a
simple {\chi}2 fit of our calculations to the measurements. By restricting this
fit to low 14C-n energy in the continuum, we can achieve a better agreement
between the radiative-capture cross sections inferred from the Coulomb-breakup
method and the exact ones. This result revives the Coulomb-breakup technique to
infer neutron radiative-capture capture to loosely-bound states, which would be
very useful for r- and s-process modelling in explosive stellar environments.

explanation for flickering and instead suggest flickering is caused by variable
mass transfer. We have analysed optical and X-ray observations to investigate
the nature of the flickering as well as the active phases in T CrB. The
spectroscopic and photometric observations confirm that the active phases
follow two periods of ~1000d and ~5000d. Flickering in the X-rays is detected
and follows an amplitude-flux relationship similar to that observed in the
optical. The flickering is most prominent at harder X-ray energies, suggesting
that it originates in the boundary layer between the accretion disc and the
white dwarf. The X-ray radiation from the boundary layer is then reprocessed by
a thick accretion disc or a nebula into UV radiation. A more detailed
understanding of flickering would benefit from long-term simultaneous X-ray and
optical monitoring of the phenomena in symbiotic recurrent novae and related

have also been observed in two other systems that host a gaseous disc, and are
likely related to the same mechanism. We report the Mg, Si, and Ca abundances
of the debris detected in the photosphere of SDSS J1043+0855, place upper
limits on O and Fe, and derive an accretion rate of (2.5 - 12)x$10^8$ g/s,
consistent with those found in other systems with detected debris discs. The
Mg/Si ratio and the upper limit on the Fe/Si ratio of the accreted material
broadly agree with those found for the crust of the Earth. We also review the
range of variability observed among white dwarfs with planetary debris discs.

on moderately high resolution (R = 22, 500) H-band integrated light spectra
from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE).
Infrared spectra offer lines from new elements, of different strengths, and at
higher excitation potentials compared to the optical. Integrated abundances of
C, N, and O are derived from CO, CN, and OH molecular features, while Fe, Na,
Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, and Ti abundances are derived from atomic features. These
abundances are compared to previous results from the optical, demonstrating the
validity and value of infrared integrated light analyses. The CNO abundances
are consistent with typical tip of the red giant branch stellar abundances, but
are systematically offset from optical, Lick index abundances. With a few
exceptions, the other abundances agree between the optical and the infrared
within the 1{\sigma} uncertainties. The first integrated K abundances are also
presented, and demonstrate that K tracks the alpha-elements. The combination of
infrared and optical abundances allows better determinations of GC properties,
and enables probes of the multiple populations in extragalactic GCs. In
particular, the integrated effects of the Na/O anticorrelation can be directly
examined for the first time.

ultra-relativistic bubble walls may be common in string theory. This occurs due
to a process of post-inflationary vacuum decay via quantum tunnelling within
(Randall-Sundrum-like) warped throats. Though a specific example is studied in
the context of type IIB string theory, we argue that our conclusions are likely
more general. Many such transitions could have occurred in the
post-inflationary Universe, as a large number of throats with exponentially
different IR scales can be present in the string landscape, potentially leading
to several signals of widely different frequencies -- a soundscape connected to
the landscape of vacua. Detectors such as eLISA and AEGIS, and observations
with BBO, SKA and EPTA (pulsar timing) have the sensitivity to detect such
signals, while at higher frequency aLIGO is not yet at the required
sensitivity. A distribution of primordial black holes is also a likely
consequence, though reliable estimates of masses and $\Omega_{\rm pBH} h^2$
require dedicated numerical simulations, as do the fine details of the GW
spectrum due to the unusual nature of both the bubble walls and transition.

cosmological applications. This is mainly due to their flat potential, which is
protected by a global shift symmetry. However, quantum gravity is known to
break global symmetries, the crucial effect in the present context being
gravitational instantons or Giddings-Strominger wormholes. We attempt to
quantify, as model-independently as possible, how large a scalar potential is
induced by this general quantum gravity effect. We pay particular attention to
the crucial issue which solutions can or cannot be trusted in the presence of a
moduli-stabilisation and a Kaluza-Klein scale. An important conclusion is that,
due to specific numerical prefactors, the effect is surprisingly small even in
UV-completions with the highest possible scale offered by string theory.
  As we go along, we discuss in detail Euclidean wormholes, cored and extremal
instantons, and how the latter arise from 5d Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. We
attempt to dispel possible doubts that wormholes contribute to the scalar
potential by an explicit calculation. We analyse the role of stabilised
dilaton-like moduli. Finally, we argue that Euclidean wormholes may be the
objects satisfying the Weak Gravity Conjecture extended to instantons.

hydrodynamical models of SLR injection into the proto-solar cloud or disc
suggest that gas-phase mixing may not be efficient enough to reproduce the
observed abundances. As an alternative, we explore the injection of SLRs via
dust grains as a way to overcome the mixing barrier. We numerically model the
interaction of a supernova remnant containing SLR-rich dust grains with a
nearby molecular cloud. The dust grains are subject to drag forces and both
thermal and non-thermal sputtering. We confirm that the expanding gas shell
stalls upon impact with the dense cloud and that gas-phase SLR injection occurs
slowly due to hydrodynamical instabilities at the cloud surface. In contrast,
dust grains of sufficient size (> 1 micron) decouple from the gas and penetrate
into the cloud within 0.1 Myr. Once inside the cloud, the dust grains are
destroyed by sputtering, releasing SLRs and rapidly enriching the dense
(potentially star-forming) regions. Our results suggest that SLR transport on
dust grains is a viable mechanism to explain SLR enrichment.

merger events. We discuss possible applications of our framework in the context
of other gravitational wave sources, such as supermassive black holes.

massive galaxies with spectra from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
(BOSS) of the third Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III), covering stellar
masses $M_*\gtrsim10^{11}~M_{\odot}$. We determine the VDF by projecting the
joint probability-density function (PDF) of luminosity $L$ and velocity
dispersion $\sigma$, i.e. $p(L,\sigma)$, defined by our previous measurements
of the RS luminosity function and $L-\sigma$ relation for this sample. These
measurements were corrected from red--blue galaxy population confusion,
photometric blurring, incompleteness and selection effects within a
forward-modeling framework that furthermore correctly accommodates the low
spectroscopic signal-to-noise ratio of individual BOSS spectra. Our $z\sim0.55$
RS VDF is in overall agreement with the $z\sim0$ early-type galaxy (ETG) VDF at
$\log_{10}\sigma\gtrsim2.47$, however the number density of $z=0.55$ RS
galaxies that we report is larger than that of $z=0$ ETG galaxies at
$2.35\gtrsim\log_{10}\sigma\gtrsim 2.47$. The extrapolation of an
intermediate-mass L-$\sigma$ relation towards the high-mass end in previous
low-z works may be responsible for this disagreement. Evolutionary
interpretation of this comparison is also subject to differences in the way the
respective samples are selected; these differences can be mitigated in future
work by analyzing $z=0$ SDSS data using the same framework presented in this

health concern. Study of intracellular viral processes can provide us to
develop drug and understanding the drug dose to decrease the HIV virus in

equation about dynamics of intracellular viral reaction kinetics. Scaling
relationship between equilibrium time and initial population of template has
been found as power low, , where N , are the number of initial population of
template species , equilibrium time, a = 163.1 , b = -0.1429 respectively.
Stochastic dynamics shows that increasing initial population of template
decreases the time of equilibrium. Entropy generation has been considered in
low, intermediate and high infection level of intracellular viral kinetics
reaction in during dynamical process. Permutation, multi scaling and modified
multiscaling entropies have been calculated for three kinds of species in
intracellular reaction dynamics, genome, structural protein, and template. Our
result shows that presence of noise in dynamical process of intracellular
reaction will change order of permutation entropy for the mentioned of three
species. In addition to multiscaling entropy is computed for mentioned model
and it has the following order: template > structural protein> genome.
Dependency of permutation entropy result to permutation order becomes small in
high infection level in intracellular viral kinetics dynamics. At short time
scale in intracellular reaction dynamics, convergency of permutation entropy
occurs with medium permutation order value. In the big time scale of
intracellular dynamics, permutation entropy scale with permutation order n as a
scaling relation .

we then called (exclusive) Multihadron Final States. At that time this meant 3-
or at best 4-particle final states of two-hadron collisions at cms energies of
some 4 GeV (not TeV!). The field of multiparticle dynamics was in fact the
domain of Polish high-energy physicists. The first of a very successful (and
still lasting) series of annual International Symposia on Multiparticle
Dynamics was organized in Paris in 1970, but essentially by Polish physicists.
Andrzej himself was not attending, but it was he who organized the third in

to infinity. These geodesics are stably trapped in the potential well near the

likely to lead to a nonlinear instability of these solutions. We argue that the
precursor of such an instability can be seen in the behaviour of linear
perturbations: nonlinear stability would require that all linear perturbations
decay sufficiently rapidly but the stable trapping implies that some linear
perturbation decay very slowly. We study this in detail for the most symmetric
microstate geometries. By constructing quasinormal modes of these geometries we
show that generic linear perturbations decay slower than any inverse power of

evaluated in a variety of reaching tasks using the 38 degree-of-freedom (DoF)

demonstrate that motion planning algorithms integrating our end-pose planning

applications from gravitational wave searches to force microscopes. The role of
quantum mechanics in the metrological limits of interferometers has a rich
history, and a large number of techniques to surpass conventional limits have
been proposed. In a typical measurement configuration, the tradeoff between the
probe's shot noise (imprecision) and its quantum backaction results in what is
known as the standard quantum limit (SQL). In this work we investigate how
quantum correlations accessed by modifying the readout of the interferometer
can access physics beyond the SQL and improve displacement sensitivity.
Specifically, we use an optical cavity to probe the motion of a silicon nitride
membrane off mechanical resonance, as one would do in a broadband displacement
or force measurement, and observe sensitivity better than the SQL dictates for
our quantum efficiency. Our measurement illustrates the core idea behind a
technique known as \textit{variational readout}, in which the optical readout
quadrature is changed as a function of frequency to improve broadband
displacement detection. And more generally our result is a salient example of
how correlations can aid sensing in the presence of backaction.

coding rate (for a fixed average error probability and a fixed average
blocklength) of variable-length full-feedback (VLF) and variable-length
stop-feedback (VLSF) codes operating over a binary erasure channel (BEC). For
the VLF setup, the achievability bound relies on a scheme that maps each
message onto a variable-length Huffman codeword and then repeats each bit of
the codeword until it is received correctly. The converse bound is inspired by
the meta-converse framework by Polyanskiy, Poor, and Verd\'u (2010) and relies
on binary sequential hypothesis testing. For the case of zero error
probability, our achievability and converse bounds match. For the VLSF case, we
provide achievability bounds that exploit the following feature of BEC: the
decoder can assess the correctness of its estimate by verifying whether the
chosen codeword is the only one that is compatible with the erasure pattern.
One of these bounds is obtained by analyzing the performance of a
variable-length extension of random linear fountain codes. The gap between the
VLSF achievability and the VLF converse bound, when number of messages is
small, is significant: $23\%$ for 8 messages on a BEC with erasure probability
$0.5.$ The absence of a tight VLSF converse bound does not allow us to assess
whether this gap is fundamental.

associated systematic uncertainties. We reproduce the radial metallicity

model, constraining gas inflow and outflow processes. We carry out a
comparative analysis of the metallicities we derive from the stellar spectra
and published HII region line fluxes, utilizing both the direct, Te-based
method and different strong-line abundance diagnostics. The direct abundances
are in relatively good agreement with the stellar metallicities, once we apply
a modest correction to the nebular oxygen abundance due to depletion onto dust.
Popular empirically calibrated strong-line diagnostics tend to provide nebular
abundances that underestimate the stellar metallicities above the solar value
by ~0.2 dex. This result could be related to difficulties in selecting
calibration samples at high metallicity. The O3N2 method calibrated by Pettini

that metal recombination lines yield nebular abundances that agree with the
stellar abundances for high metallicity systems, but find evidence that in more
metal-poor environments they tend to underestimate the stellar metallicities by
a significant amount, opposite to the behavior of the direct method.

the STELLA robotic observatory and determined new and more precise stellar
physical parameters. Precalculated synthetic spectra were fit to each of these
spectra, and we provide new spot-corrected orbital elements. A sample of 34
absorption lines per spectrum was used to calculate mean line profiles with a
S/N of several hundred. A total of 13 temperature Doppler images were
reconstructed from these line profiles with the inversion code iMap.
Differential rotation was investigated by cross-correlating successive Doppler
images in each observing season. Spots on HD 208472 are distributed preferably
at high latitudes and less frequently around mid-to-low latitudes. No polar-cap
like structure is seen at any epoch. We observed a flip-flop event between 2009

0.5, while the overall brightness of the star continued to increase and reached
an all-time maximum in 2014. Cross-correlation of successive Doppler images
suggests a solar-like differential rotation that is ~15 times weaker than that

be taken: either try and reduce their study to that of lower dimensional ones,
or try and understand what kind of universal properties might precisely emerge
in this regime. We actually do not choose which of these two attitudes to

strategic agents with asymmetric information. In a series of seminal papers in
the literature, this problem has been investigated under a simplifying model
where myopically selfish players appear sequentially and act once in the game,
based on private noisy observations of the system state and public observation
of past players' actions. It has been shown that there exist information
cascades where users discard their private information and mimic the action of
their predecessor. In this paper, we provide a framework for studying Bayesian
learning dynamics in a more general setting than the one described above. In
particular, our model incorporates cases where players are non-myopic and
strategically participate for the whole duration of the game, and cases where
an endogenous process selects which subset of players will act at each time
instance. The proposed framework hinges on a sequential decomposition
methodology for finding structured perfect Bayesian equilibria (PBE) of a
general class of dynamic games with asymmetric information, where user-specific
states evolve as conditionally independent Markov processes and users make
independent noisy observations of their states. Using this methodology, we
study a specific dynamic learning model where players make decisions about
public investment based on their estimates of everyone's types. We characterize
a set of informational cascades for this problem where learning stops for the
team as a whole. We show that in such cascades, all players' estimates of other
players' types freeze even though each individual player asymptotically learns
its own true type.

Particles have board-like shape, with sizes chosen using a symmetry criterion:
same volume and same aspect ratio $\kappa$. Phase diagrams were calculated for

adsorption strengths the mixtures exhibit a second-order uniaxial
nematic-biaxial nematic transition for molar fraction of rods $0\leq x\lesssim

aligned perpendicular and parallel to the monolayer, respectively. At the
transition, the orientational symmetry of the plate axes is broken, and they
orient parallel to a director lying on the surface. For large and equal
adsorption strengths the mixture demixes at low pressures into a uniaxial
nematic phase, rich in plates, and a biaxial nematic phase, rich in rods. This
demixing is located between two tricritical points. Also, at higher pressures

first-order uniaxial nematic-biaxial nematic phase transition with a large
density coexistence gap. When rod adsorption is considerably large while that
of plates is small, the transition to the biaxial nematic phase is always of

reduction of signal dimensionality (compression), and the ability to use
supplementary contextual information to inform the prediction. The presented

importance for their applications in electronics and photonics. Because of the
imperfections, electrons moving on these two-dimensional (2D) crystals
experience a spatially non-uniform Coulomb environment, whose effect on the
charge transport has not been microscopically studied. Here, we report the
mesoscopic conductance mapping in monolayer and few-layer MoS2 field-effect

evolution of the insulator-to-metal transition is clearly resolved.
Interestingly, as the transistors are gradually turned on, electrical
conduction emerges initially at the edges before appearing in the bulk of MoS2
flakes, which can be explained by our first-principles calculations. The
results unambiguously confirm that the contribution of edge states to the
channel conductance is significant under the threshold voltage but negligible
once the bulk of the TMD device becomes conductive. Strong conductance
inhomogeneity, which is associated with the fluctuations of disorder potential
in the 2D sheets, is also observed in the MIM images, providing a guideline for
future improvement of the device performance.

at high temperature and near atmospheric pressures of O2 gas with in situ x-ray
scattering measurements. We find that the hexagonal reconstruction (hex) of Au
(001) surface lifts to (1x1) in the presence of O2 gas, indicating that the
(1x1) is more favored when some oxygen atoms present on the surface. The
measured lifting rate constant vs. temperature is found to be highest at
intermediate temperature exhibiting a 'volcano'-type behavior. At low
temperature, the hex-to-(1x1) activation barrier (Eact = 1.3(3) eV) limits the
lifting. At high temperature, oxygen adsorption energy (Eads = 1.6(2) eV)
limits the lifting. The (1x1)-to-hex activation barrier (Ehex = 0.41(14) eV) is
also obtained from hex recovery kinetics. The pressure-temperature (PT) surface
phase diagram obtained in this study shows three regions: hex at low P and T,
(1x1) at high P and T, and coexistence of the hex and (1x1) at the intermediate
P and T.

the simplest five-dimensional RS-II brane-world cosmology. In this paper we
revisit the constraints on dark radiation based upon the newest results for
light-element nuclear reaction rates, observed light-element abundances and the
power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Adding dark radiation
during big bang nucleosynthesis alters the Friedmann expansion rate causing the
nuclear reactions to freeze out at a different temperature. This changes the
final light element abundances at the end of BBN. Its influence on the CMB is
to change the effective expansion rate at the surface of last scattering. We
find that our adopted BBN constraints reduce the allowed range for dark
radiation to between $-12.1\%$ and $+6.2\%$ of the ambient background energy
density. Combining this result with fits to the CMB power spectrum, the range
decreases to $-6.0\%$ to $+6.2\%$. Thus, we find, that the ratio of dark
radiation to the background total relativistic mass energy density $\rho_{\rm
DR}/\rho$ is consistent with zero although in the BBN analysis there could be a
slight preference for a negative contribution. However, the BBN constraint
depends strongly upon the adopted primordial helium abundance.

galaxies (BCDs) remains largely unexplained by theoretical models of BCD
formation. We therefore investigate the rotation curves in BCDs formed from
mergers between gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxies based on the results of
numerical simulations for BCD formation. The principal results are as follows.
The dark matter of merging dwarf irregulars undergoes a central concentration
so that the central density can become up to six times higher than those of the
initial dwarf irregulars. However, the more compact dark matter halo alone can
not reproduce the gradient differences observed between dwarf irregulars and
BCDs. We provide further support that the central concentration of gas due to
rapid gas-transfer to the central regions of dwarf--dwarf mergers is
responsible for the observed difference in rotation curve gradients. The BCDs
with central gas concentration formed from merging can thus show steeply rising
rotation curves in their central regions. Such gas concentration is also
responsible for central starbursts of BCDs and the high central surface
brightness and is consistent with previous BCD studies. We discuss the
relationship between rotational velocity gradient and surface brightness, the
dependence of BCD rotation curves on star formation threshold density,
progenitor initial profile, interaction type and merger mass ratio, as well as
potential evolutionary links between dwarf irregulars, BCDs and compact dwarf
irregulars.

based on theory and observation. Our model consists of an equilibrium, gaseous,
and locally isothermal disk orbiting a central star of mass $M_*=M_{sol}/3$.
Disks with a minimum Toomre $Q$ of $Q_{min} \lesssim 0.9$ will fragment and
form gravitationally bound clumps. Some previous literature has found $Q_{min}
< 1.3-1.5$ to be sufficient for fragmentation. Increasing disk height tends to
stabilize disks, and when incorporated into $Q$ as $Q_{eff}\propto
Q(H/R)^\alpha$ for $\alpha=0.18$ is sufficient to predict fragmentation. Some
discrepancies in the literature regarding $Q_{crit}$ may be due to different
methods of generating initial conditions (ICs). A series of 15 simulations
demonstrates that perturbing ICs slightly out of equilibrium can cause disks to
fragment for higher $Q$. Our method for generating ICs is presented in detail.
We argue that GI likely plays a role in PPDs around M-dwarfs and that disk
fragmentation at large radii is a plausible outcome for these disks.

particularly Active Appearance Models (AAMs) method, has become one of the most
successful face modeling approaches over the last two decades. AAM models have
ability to represent face images through synthesis using a controllable
parameterized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model. However, the accuracy
and robustness of the synthesized faces of AAM are highly depended on the
training sets and inherently on the generalizability of PCA subspaces. This
paper presents a novel Deep Appearance Models (DAMs) approach, an efficient
replacement for AAMs, to accurately capture both shape and texture of face
images under large variations. In this approach, three crucial components
represented in hierarchical layers are modeled using the Deep Boltzmann
Machines (DBM) to robustly capture the variations of facial shapes and
appearances. DAMs are therefore superior to AAMs in inferencing a
representation for new face images under various challenging conditions. The
proposed approach is evaluated in various applications to demonstrate its
robustness and capabilities, i.e. facial super-resolution reconstruction,
facial off-angle reconstruction or face frontalization, facial occlusion
removal and age estimation using challenging face databases, i.e. Labeled Face
Parts in the Wild (LFPW), Helen and FG-NET. Comparing to AAMs and other deep
learning based approaches, the proposed DAMs achieve competitive results in
those applications, thus this showed their advantages in handling occlusions,
facial representation, and reconstruction.

present paper we introduce an alternative approach for the study of the
relativistic fluid sphere, based on the relativistic mass equation, obtained by
eliminating the energy density in the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation.
Despite its apparent complexity, the relativistic mass equation can be solved
exactly by using a power series representation for the mass, and the Cauchy
convolution for infinite power series. We obtain exact series solutions for
general relativistic dense astrophysical objects described by the linear
barotropic and the polytropic equations of state, respectively. For the
polytropic case we obtain the exact power series solution corresponding to
arbitrary values of the polytropic index $n$. The explicit form of the solution
is presented for the polytropic index $n=1$, and for the indexes $n=1/2$ and

fracture has some peculiar features. This paper is focused on two of them. One
can be reflected by a proposed paradox that geometrically similar structures
with interface cracks under similar loadings may have different failure
behaviors. The other one is that the existing fracture parameters of the
oscillatory singular stress field, such as a complex stress intensity factor,
exhibit some non-objectivity because their phase angle depend on an arbitrarily
chosen length. Two objective and independent fracture parameters are proposed
which can fully characterize the stress field near the crack tip. One parameter
represents the stress intensity with classical unit of stress intensity
factors. It is interesting to find that the loading mode can be characterized
by a length as the other parameter, which can properly reflect the phase of the
stress oscillation with respect to the distance to the crack tip. This is quite
different from other crack tip fields in which the loading mode is usually
expressed by a phase angle. The corresponding failure criterion for interface
cracks does not include any arbitrarily chosen quantity, and therefore is
convenient for comparing and accumulating experimental results, even existing

we conduct an in-depth analytical investigation on real IoT data. More
specifically, we identify IoT data sources over the Web and develop a crawler

to rigorously realize volume conservation in finite strain regime, especially
when the unloading stress free configuration is not adopted or unique in the
elastoplastic theories. An accurate condition of volume conservation is
clarified and used in this paper that the density of a volume element after the
applied loads are completely removed should be identical to that of the initial
stress free states. For the elastoplastic theories that adopt the unloading
stress free configuration (i.e. the intermediate configuration), the accurate
condition of volume conservation is satisfied only if specific definitions of
the plastic strain rate are used among many other different definitions. For
the elastoplastic theories that do not adopt the unloading stress free
configuration, it is even more difficult to realize volume conservation as the
information of the stress free state lacks. To find a universal approach of
realizing volume conservation for elastoplastic theories whether or not adopt
the unloading stress free configuration, we propose a single assumption that
the density of material only depends on the trace of the Cauchy stress, and
interestingly find that the zero trace of the plastic stress rate is equivalent
to the accurate condition of volume conservation. Two strategies are further
proposed to satisfy the accurate condition of volume conservation: directly and
slightly revising the tangential stiffness tensor or using a properly chosen
stress/strain measure and elastic compliance tensor. They are implemented into
existing elastoplastic theories, and the volume conservation is demonstrated by
both theoretical proof and numerical examples.

of the key performance parameters of a wireless cellular network, and its
analytical as well as numerical evaluation has occupied many researchers.
Recently, the introduction of stochastic geometric modeling of cellular
networks has brought the outage problem to the forefront again. A popular and
powerful approach is to exploit the available moment generating function (or
Laplace transform) of received signal and interference, whenever it exists, by
applying the Gil-Pelaez inversion formula. However, with the stochastic
geometric modeling, the moment generating function may either be too
complicated to exist in closed-form or at worst may not exist. Toward this end,
in this paper, we study two alternate ways of evaluating the SINR outage. In
the first case, we emphasize the significance of calculating cumulants over
moments and exploit the fact that the cumulants of point processes are easily
calculable using Campbell's theorem. The SINR outage is then analytically
characterized by Charlier expansion based on Gaussian and Student's
$t$-distributions and their associated Hermite and Krishnamoorthy polynomials.
In the second case, we exploit the saddle point method, which gives a
semi-analytical method of calculating the SINR outage, whenever the cumulant
generating function of received signal and interference exists. For the purpose
of demonstration, we apply these techniques on a downlink cellular network
model where a typical user experiences a coordinated multi-point transmission,
and the base stations are modeled by homogeneous Poisson point process. For the
convenience of readers, we also provide a brief overview of moments, cumulants,
their generating functions, and Campbell's theorem, without invoking measure
theory. Numerical results illustrate the accuracy of the proposed mathematical
approaches.

understand intrinsic features of Bose-Einstein condensate which corresponds to
the case when the horizon area almost consists of punctures in the ground

the increasing penetration of volatile and intermittent devices. These devices
can also provide limited reactive power resources that can be used to regulate
the network-wide voltage. A decentralized voltage control strategy can be
designed by minimizing a quadratic voltage mismatch error objective using
gradient-projection (GP) updates. Coupled with the power network flow, the
local voltage can provide the instantaneous gradient information. This paper
aims to analyze the performance of this decentralized GP-based voltage control
design under two dynamic scenarios: i) the nodes perform the decentralized
update in an asynchronous fashion, and ii) the network operating condition is
time-varying. For the asynchronous voltage control, we improve the existing
convergence condition by recognizing that the voltage based gradient is always
up-to-date. By modeling the network dynamics using an autoregressive process
and considering time-varying resource constraints, we provide an error bound in
tracking the instantaneous optimal solution to the quadratic error objective.
This result can be extended to more general \textit{constrained dynamic

stochastic processes that have bounded iterative changes. Extensive numerical

dwarf companions. These imaged companions populate a mass, separation and age
domain (mass>1MJup, orbits>5AU, age<1Gyr) quite distinct from the one occupied
by exoplanets discovered by the radial velocity or transit methods. This
distinction could pinpoint that different formation mechanisms are at play. We
aim at investigating correlations between the host star's mass and the presence
of wide-orbit giant planets, and at providing new observational constraints on
planetary formation models. We observed 58 young and nearby M-type dwarfs in
L'-band with the VLT/NaCo instrument and used ADI algorithms to optimize the
sensitivity to planetary-mass companions and to derive the best detection
limits. We estimate the probability of detecting a planet as a function of its
mass and physical separation around each target. We conduct a Bayesian analysis
to determine the frequency of substellar companions orbiting low-mass stars,
using a homogenous sub-sample of 54 stars. We derive a frequency of
$4.4^{+3.2}_{-1.3}\%$ for companions with masses in the range of 2-80MJup}, and
$2.3^{+2.9}_{-0.7}$\% for planetary mass companions (2-14MJup), at physical
separations of 8 to 400AU for both cases. Comparing our results with a previous
survey targeting more massive stars, we find evidence that substellar
companions more massive than 1MJup with a low mass ratio Q with respect to
their host star (Q<1%), are less frequent around low-mass stars. This may
represent an observational evidence that the frequency of imaged wide-orbit
substellar companions is correlated with stellar mass, corroborating
theoretical expectations. On the opposite, we show statistical evidence that
intermediate-mass ratio (1%<Q<5%) companion with masses >2MJup might be
independent from the mass of the host star.

effect of in plane magnetic field confirms that splitting is due to
spin-splitting and that spin polarization is in the plane, characteristic of a
Rashba interaction with magnitude approximately 25 meV. Consistent with the
presence of intrinsic interfacial electric field we show that the splitting can
be enhanced by an applied displacement field in dual gated samples. Giant
negative magnetoresistance, up to 75%, and a field induced anomalous Hall
effect at magnetic fields < 1 T are observed. These demonstrate that hybridized
Au has a magnetic moment and suggests the proximity to formation of a

extend the basic idea in our former paper [W. Zhao, Y. Fu and T. Zhou, SIAM J.
Sci. Comput., 36 (2014), pp. A1731-A1751] to solve high-dimensional FBSDEs, by
using the spectral sparse grid approximations. The main issue for solving high
dimensional FBSDEs is to build an efficient spatial discretization, and deal
with the related high dimensional conditional expectations and interpolations.
In this work, we propose the sparse grid spatial discretization. We use the
sparse grid Gaussian-Hermite quadrature rule to approximate the conditional
expectations. And for the associated high dimensional interpolations, we adopt
an spectral expansion of functions in polynomial spaces with respect to the
spatial variables, and use the sparse grid approximations to recover the
expansion coefficients. The FFT algorithm is used to speed up the recovery
procedure, and the entire algorithm admits efficient and high accurate
approximations in high-dimensions, provided that the solutions are sufficiently
smooth. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency
of the proposed methods.

is proposed for fingerprint templates. The proposed method transforms a
real-valued feature vector into index code such that the pairwise-order measure
in the resultant codes are closely correlated with rank similarity measure.
Such a ranking based technique offers two major merits: 1) Resilient to
noises/perturbations in numeric values; and 2) Highly nonlinear embedding based
on partial order statistics. The former takes care of the accuracy performance
mitigating numeric noises/perturbations while the latter offers strong
non-invertible transformation via nonlinear feature embedding from Euclidean to
Rank space that leads to toughness in inversion. The experimental results
demonstrate reasonable accuracy performance on benchmark FVC2002 and FVC2004
fingerprint databases, thus confirm the proposition of the rank correlation.
Moreover, the security and privacy analysis justify the strong capability
against the existing major privacy attacks.

of the reactants in the hydrogel and in the bulk as well as for their transfer
free energy jump upon entering the hydrogel shell. Moreover, we work out an
approximate analytical formula for the overall rate constant, which is valid in
the physically relevant range of geometrical and chemical parameters. We
discuss in depth how the diffusion-controlled part of the rate depends on the
essential variables, including the size of the central core. In particular, we
derive some simple rules for estimating the number of nanocatalysts per
nanoreactor for an efficient catalytic performance in the case of small to
intermediate core sizes. Our theoretical treatment promises to provide a very
useful and flexible tool for the design of superior performing nanoreactor
geometries and with optimized nanoparticle load.

sequence with some target distribution. This is a promising tool to generate a
codeword with a biased code-symbol distribution, which is required for
capacity-achieving communication by asymmetric channels. It is known that
asymptotically optimal homophonic coding can be realized by a Fixed-to-Variable
(FV) length code using an interval algorithm similar to a random number
generator. However, FV codes are not preferable as a component of channel codes
since a decoding error propagates to all subsequent codewords. As a solution
for this problem an asymptotically optimal Variable-to-Fixed (VF) length
homophonic code, dual Shannon-Fano-Elias-Gray (dual SFEG) code, is proposed in
this paper. This code can be interpreted as a dual of a modified
Shannon-Fano-Elias (SFE) code based on Gray code. It is also shown as a
by-product that the modified SFE code, named SFEG code, achieves a better
coding rate than the original SFE code in lossless source coding.

with logarithmic interaction potentials onto a system described by the

we present two general theorems on the finite-particle approximations of

sufficient condition for a kind of tightness of solutions of stochastic
differential equations (SDE) describing finite-particle systems, and prove that
the limit points solve the corresponding ISDE. This implies, if in addition the
limit ISDE enjoy a uniqueness of solutions, then the full sequence converges.
We treat non-reversible case in the first main theorem. % In the second general
theorem, we restrict to the case of reversible particle systems and simplify
the sufficient condition. We deduce the second theorem from the first. % We
apply the second general theorem to Airy$ _{\beta }$ interacting Brownian
motion with $ \beta = 1,2,4$, and the Ginibre interacting Brownian motion. The
former appears in the soft-edge limit of Gaussian
(orthogonal/unitary/symplectic) ensembles in one spatial dimension, and the
latter in the bulk limit of Ginibre ensemble in two spatial dimensions,
corresponding to a quantum statistical system for which the eigen-value spectra
belong to non-Hermitian Gaussian random matrices. The passage from the
finite-particle stochastic differential equation (SDE) to the limit ISDE is a
sensitive problem because the logarithmic potentials are long range and
unbounded at infinity. Indeed, the limit ISDEs are not easily detectable from
those of finite dimensions. Our general theorems can be applied
straightforwardly to the grand canonical Gibbs measures with Ruelle-class

long-range correlations due to the action of non-Hermitean quantum jump
operators that constitute a mechanism for dissipative cooling. Starting from an
initially disordered state corresponding to a vortex condensate, the
dissipative process results in the annihilation of vortex-antivortex pairs and
the establishment of quasi long-range order at late times. We observe that a
finite vortex density survives the cooling process which disagrees with the
analytically constructed vortex-free Bose-Einstein condensate at asymptotic
times. This indicates that quantum fluctuations beyond the truncated Wigner
approximation need to be included to fully capture the physics of dissipative
Bose-Einstein condensation.

but approximate it with very different convergence rates. In the case of the

where $K$ is the order of the applied polarization expansion. The error of the
surface-integral formula decreases exponentially as $a^K/(K+1)!$, where $a=\ln2
-\tfrac{1}{2}$. The variational formula performs best, its error decays as
$K^{1/2} [a^{ K}/(K+1)!]^2$. These convergence rates are much faster than those
resulting from approximating the wave function through the multipole expansion.
This shows the efficiency of the partial resummation of the multipole series
effected by the polarization expansion. Our results demonstrate also the

successful applications, in computer vision, biomedical signal and image
processing, and radar data processing. For these applications, an important
ongoing challenge is to develop Riemannian-geometric tools which are adapted to
structured covariance matrices. The present paper proposes to meet this
challenge by introducing a new class of probability distributions, Gaussian
distributions of structured covariance matrices. These are Riemannian analogs
of Gaussian distributions, which only sample from covariance matrices having a
preassigned structure, such as complex, Toeplitz, or block-Toeplitz. The
usefulness of these distributions stems from three features: (1) they are
completely tractable, analytically or numerically, when dealing with large
covariance matrices, (2) they provide a statistical foundation to the concept
of structured Riemannian barycentre (i.e. Fr\'echet or geometric mean), (3)
they lead to efficient statistical learning algorithms, which realise, among
others, density estimation and classification of structured covariance
matrices. The paper starts from the observation that several spaces of
structured covariance matrices, considered from a geometric point of view, are
Riemannian symmetric spaces. Accordingly, it develops an original theory of
Gaussian distributions on Riemannian symmetric spaces, of their statistical
inference, and of their relationship to the concept of Riemannian barycentre.
Then, it uses this original theory to give a detailed description of Gaussian
distributions of three kinds of structured covariance matrices, complex,
Toeplitz, and block-Toeplitz. Finally, it describes algorithms for density
estimation and classification of structured covariance matrices, based on
Gaussian distribution mixture models.

remarkable progress mainly on the experimental front, numerous open question
remain, related to the growth, relaxation and thermalisation of such systems,
and there is still no universally-accepted theory for their theoretical
description. In this paper we discuss one of the state-of-the-art kinetic
approaches, which gives an intuitive picture of the physical processes
happening at the microscopic scale, being broadly applicable both below and
above the critical region (but not within the critical region itself).
Specifically, the Zaremba-Nikuni-Griffin (ZNG) scheme provides a
self-consistent description of the coupling between the condensate and the
thermal atoms, including the collisions between these two subsystems. It has
been successfully tested against experiments in various settings, including
collective modes (e.g. monopole, dipole and quadrupole modes), topological
excitations (solitons and vortices) and surface evaporative cooling. Here, we
show that it can capture two important aspects of non- equilibrium dynamics for
both single-component and two-component BECs: the Kohn mode (the undamped
dipole oscillation independent of interactions and temperature) and
(re)thermalization leading to condensate growth following sudden evaporation.
Our simulations, performed in a spherically-symmetric trap reveal (i) an
interesting two-stage dynamics and the emergence of a prominent monopole mode
in the evaporative cooling of a single component Bose gas, and (ii) the long
thermalization time associated with the sympathetic cooling of a realistic
two-component mixture. Related open questions arise about the mechanisms and
the nature of thermalization in such systems, where further controlled
experiments are needed for benchmarking.

possible violations of the Weak Equivalence Principle by measuring relative
accelerations between test masses of different composition with a precision of
one part in $10^{18}$. A serendipitous byproduct of the experimental design is
that the absolute (common-mode) acceleration of the test masses is also
measured to high precision as they oscillate along a common axis under the
influence of restoring forces produced by the position sensor currents, which
in drag-free mode lead to Newtonian accelerations as small as $10^{-14}$ g.
This is deep inside the low-acceleration regime where Modified Newtonian
Dynamics (MOND) diverges strongly from the Newtonian limit of General
Relativity. We show that MOND theories (including those based on the
widely-used $n$-family of interpolating functions as well as the covariant
Tensor-Vector-Scalar formulation) predict an easily detectable increase in the
frequency of oscillations of the STEP test masses if the Strong Equivalence
Principle holds. If it does not hold, MOND predicts a cumulative increase in
oscillation amplitude which is also detectable. STEP thus provides a new and
potentially decisive test of Newton's law of inertia, as well as the
equivalence principle in both its strong and weak forms.

linear chain under open and periodic boundary conditions, and give the exact
conditions for the emergence of the local vibration mode when one of the atoms
is replaced by an impurity. Our motivation is twofold. Firstly, in deriving the
dispersion relation of the atoms, periodic boundary condition is overwhelmingly
utilized while open boundary condition is seldomly referred. Therefore we
manage to obtain the dispersion relation under both boundary conditions
simultaneously by Molinari formula. Secondly, in the presence of impurity,
local vibration mode can emerge as long as the mass of the impurity $m'$ is
smaller than the mass of the perfect atom $m$ to certain degree, which can be
measured by the mass ratio $\delta=\frac{m-m'}{m}$. At periodic boundary
condition, the critical mass ratio is $0$ or $\frac{1}{N}$, depending on
whether the length $N$ of the chain is even or odd. At open boundary condition,
the critical mass ratio is $\frac{N}{2N-1}$ if the impurity locates at the end
of the chain, while it is $\frac{N}{(2N_l+1)(2N_r+1)}$ with $N_l$ and $N_r$ be
the number of atoms at the left and right hand sides of the impurity if the
impurity locates at the middle.

g$ to 10%, 1%, or better can be envisioned. This could constitute the first
gravitational measurement of leptonic matter, of second-generation matter and,
possibly, the first measurement of the gravitational acceleration of
antimatter.

Lett",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.093001",,"physics.atom-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report measurements of energy-dependent attosecond photoionization delays
between the two outer-most valence shells of N$_2$O and H$_2$O. The combination
of single-shot signal referencing with the use of different metal foils to
filter the attosecond pulse train enables us to extract delays from congested
spectra. Remarkably large delays up to 160 as are observed in N$_2$O, whereas
the delays in H$_2$O are all smaller than 50 as in the photon-energy range of
20-40 eV. These results are interpreted by developing a theory of molecular
photoionization delays. The long delays measured in N$_2$O are shown to reflect
the population of molecular shape resonances that trap the photoelectron for a
duration of up to $\sim$110 as. The unstructured continua of H$_2$O result in
much smaller delays at the same photon energies. Our experimental and
theoretical methods make the study of molecular attosecond photoionization
dynamics accessible.

-(1/\beta)\arcsin(\beta F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}/4)$ is proposed. The scale
invariance and the dual invariance of electromagnetic fields are broken in the
model. In the limit $\beta\rightarrow 0$ one comes to Maxwell's electrodynamics
and the scale and dual invariances are recovered. We investigate the effect of
coupling electromagnetic fields with the gravitational field. The asymptotic
black hole solution is found which is similar to the Reissner-Nordstr\""om
solution. We obtain corrections to Coulomb's law and to the
Reissner-Nordstr\""om solution in the model proposed. The existence of the
regular asymptotic at $r\rightarrow 0$ was demonstrated. The mass of the black
hole is calculated possessing the electromagnetic origin. It was shown that
there are not superluminal fluctuations and principles of causality and
unitarity take place.

  Plasma Exposure",,,"10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b01853",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Controllable doping of two-dimensional materials is highly desired for ideal
device performance in both hetero- and p-n homo-junctions. Herein, we propose
an effective strategy for doping of MoS2 with nitrogen through a remote N2
plasma surface treatment. By monitoring the surface chemistry of MoS2 upon N2
plasma exposure using in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we identified
the presence of covalently bonded nitrogen in MoS2, where substitution of the
chalcogen sulfur by nitrogen is determined as the doping mechanism.
Furthermore, the electrical characterization demonstrates that p-type doping of
MoS2 is achieved by nitrogen doping, in agreement with theoretical predictions.
Notably, we found that the presence of nitrogen can induce compressive strain
in the MoS2 structure, which represents the first evidence of strain induced by
substitutional doping in a transition metal dichalcogenide material. Finally,
our first principle calculations support the experimental demonstration of such
strain, and a correlation between nitrogen doping concentration and compressive
strain in MoS2 is elucidated.

prefer- ence relations among alternatives. However, in many cases, the pairwise
comparison matrix is difficult to complete, which obstructs the subsequent
operations of the clas- sical AHP. In this paper, based on DEMATEL which has
ability to derive the total relation matrix from direct relation matrix, a new
completion method for incomplete pairwise comparison matrix is proposed. The
proposed method provides a new per- spective to estimate the missing values
with explicit physical meaning. Besides, the proposed method has low
computational cost. This promising method has a wide application in
multi-criteria decision-making.

H_n is defined to be the group of all permutations p of a disjoint union of
copies of the natural numbers N, with the property that each copy of N contains
a cofinite subset on which p restricts to a translation. Our group G(n) is
defined to be the group of all permutations p of a disjoint union of quadrants
(i.e., copies of NxN) with the property that each quadrant contains a
subquadrant on which p is a translation, while p restricted to the remaining
set is piecewise isometric on a cofinite disjoint union of rays (each isometric
to N). Based on K.S. Brown's treatment of the Houghton group case it is shown
that G(n) is of type FP(n-1); in fact, that G(n) contains a normal subgroup N
with G(n)/N = Z^(n-1) which is of type FP(n-1) and not FPn.

in numerical relativity for solving partial differential equations. The
$\theta$-ICN method is the extension of the original ICN method where $\theta$
is the weight when averaging the predicted and corrected values. It has better
stability when $\theta$ is chosen to be larger than 0.5, but the accuracy is
reduced since the $\theta$-ICN method is second order accurate only when
$\theta$ = 0.5. In this paper, we propose two modified $\theta$-ICN algorithms
that have second order of convergence rate when $\theta$ is not 0.5, based on
two different ways to choose the weight $\theta$. The first approach employs
two geometrically averaged $\theta$s in two iterations within one time step,
and the second one uses arithmetically averaged $\theta$s for two consecutive
time steps while $\theta$ remains the same in each time step. The stability and
second order accuracy of our methods are verified using stability and
truncation error analysis and are demonstrated by numerical examples on linear
and semi-linear hyperbolic partial differential equations and Burgers'
equation.

exposure to whole body 900 MHz radiofrequency radiation and cancer in the

following explanation for these results. The neurons around the rat's brain and
heart form closed electrical circuits and, following Faraday's Law, 900 MHz
radiofrequency radiation induces 900 MHz electrical currents in these neural
circuits. In turn, these 900 MHz currents in the neural circuits generate
sufficient localized heat in the neural cell axons to shift the equilibrium
concentration of carcinogenic radicals to higher levels and thus, to higher
incidences of cancer. This model is then applied to mice and humans.
