  and X-ray emission lines","11 pages, 10 figures",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201628858",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context. The accretion process in Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs) can be
studied through the analysis of some UV and X-ray emission lines which trace
hot gas flows and act as diagnostics of the post-shock downfalling plasma. In
the UV band, where higher spectral resolution is available, these lines are
characterized by rather complex profiles whose origin is still not clear.
  Aims. We investigate the origin of UV and X-ray emission at impact regions of
density structured (fragmented) accretion streams.We study if and how the
stream fragmentation and the resulting structure of the post-shock region
determine the observed profiles of UV and X-ray emission lines.
  Methods. We model the impact of an accretion stream consisting of a series of
dense blobs onto the chromosphere of a CTTS through 2D MHD simulations. We
explore different levels of stream fragmentation and accretion rates. From the
model results, we synthesize C IV (1550 {\AA}) and OVIII (18.97 {\AA}) line
profiles.
  Results. The impacts of accreting blobs onto the stellar chromosphere produce
reverse shocks propagating through the blobs and shocked upflows. These
upflows, in turn, hit and shock the subsequent downfalling fragments. As a
result, several plasma components differing for the downfalling velocity,
density, and temperature are present altoghether. The profiles of C IV doublet
are characterized by two main components: one narrow and redshifted to speed
$\approx$ 50 km s$^{-1}$ and the other broader and consisting of subcomponents
with redshift to speed in the range 200 $\approx$ 400 km s$^{-1}$. The profiles
of OVIII lines appear more symmetric than C IV and are redshifted to speed
$\approx$ 150 km s$^{-1}$.
  Conclusions. Our model predicts profiles of C IV line remarkably similar to
those observed and explains their origin in a natural way as due to stream
fragmentation.

paper investigates the problem of disseminating all files among the devices
while reducing the total time of communication, i.e., the completion time,
using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC). While previous studies on the
use of IDNC in D2D systems assume a fully connected communication network, this
paper tackles the more realistic scenario of a partially connected network in
which devices can only target devices in their transmission range. The paper
first formulates the optimal joint optimization of selecting the transmitting
device(s) and the file combination(s) and exhibits its intractability. The
completion time is approximated using the celebrated decoding delay approach by
deriving the relationship between the quantities in a partially connected
network. The paper introduces the cooperation graph and demonstrates that the
relaxed problem is equivalent to a maximum weight clique problem over the newly
designed graph wherein the weights are obtained by solving a similar problem on
the local IDNC graphs. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed solution
provides noticeable performance enhancement and outperforms previously proposed
IDNC-based schemes.

conductivity is more important than in the bulk limit, since lattice thermal
conductivity is much more sensitive to sample or grain size at these scales.
Last, when electron-impurity scattering effects are included, we find that the
electronic thermal conductivity is reduced by 30 to 70 %. We also find that the
Wiedemann-Franz law is broadly satisfied at low and high temperatures, but with
the largest deviations of 20-50 % around room temperature.

debris discs, and are considered as signposts of planetary systems and,
therefore, provide important insights into the configuration and evolution of
the planetary system. Consequently, in order to learn more about the 94 Ceti
system, we aim to precisely model the dust emission to fit its observed SED and
to simulate its orbital dynamics. We interpret our APEX bolometric observations
and complement them with archived Spitzer and Herschel bolometric data to
explore the stellar excess and to map out background sources in the fields.
Dynamical simulations and 3D radiative transfer calculations were used to
constrain the debris disc configurations and model the dust emission. The best
fit dust disc model for 94 Ceti implies a circumbinary disc around the
secondary pair, limited by dynamics to radii smaller than 40 AU and with a
grain size power-law distribution of ~a^-3.5. This model exhibits a
dust-to-star luminosity ratio of 4.6+-0.4*10^-6. The system is dynamically
stable and N-body symplectic simulations results are consistent with
semi-analytical equations that describe orbits in binary systems. In the
observations we also find tentative evidence of a circumtertiary ring that
could be edge-on.

type stars. The amplitudes induced by magnetic cycles and rotation show a clear
correlation. A trend of photometric amplitudes with rotation period is also
outlined in the data. For a given activity index the amplitudes of the

which addresses many of the pitfalls of K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
classification. It has yielded competitive results on several computer vision
benchmarks. Its central tenet is that during NN search, a query is not compared
to every example in a database, ignoring class information. Instead, NN
searches are performed within each class, generating a score per class. A key
problem with NN techniques, including NBNN, is that they fail when the data
representation does not capture perceptual (e.g.~class-based) similarity. NBNN
circumvents this by using independent engineered descriptors (e.g.~SIFT). To
extend its applicability outside of image-based domains, we propose to learn a
metric which captures perceptual similarity. Similar to how Neighbourhood
Components Analysis optimizes a differentiable form of KNN classification, we
propose ""Class Conditional"" metric learning (CCML), which optimizes a soft form
of the NBNN selection rule. Typical metric learning algorithms learn either a
global or local metric. However, our proposed method can be adjusted to a
particular level of locality by tuning a single parameter. An empirical
evaluation on classification and retrieval tasks demonstrates that our proposed
method clearly outperforms existing learned distance metrics across a variety

findings suggest that two-layer NMF is a valuable alternative to existing
dynamic topic modeling approaches found in the literature, and can unveil niche
topics and associated vocabularies not captured by existing methods.
Substantively, our findings suggest that the political agenda of the EP evolves
significantly over time and reacts to exogenous events such as EU Treaty
referenda and the emergence of the Euro-crisis. MEP contributions to the
plenary agenda are also found to be impacted upon by voting behaviour and the
committee structure of the Parliament.

neutron stars, due to nonlinear mode coupling. Emission of gravitational waves
drives the f-mode (fundamental mode) unstable in fast-rotating, newborn neutron
stars. The initial growth phase of the mode is followed by its saturation,
because of energy leaking to other modes of the star. The saturation point
determines the strain of the generated gravitational-wave signal, which can
then be used to extract information about the neutron star equation of state.
The parent (unstable) mode couples via parametric resonances with pairs of
daughter modes, with the triplets' evolution exhibiting a rich variety of
behaviors. We study both supernova- and merger-derived neutron stars, simply
modeled as polytropes in a Newtonian context, and show that the parent may
couple to many different daughter pairs during the star's evolution through the
instability window, with the saturation amplitude changing by orders of

Climbing Compliant Modular Robot, capable of tackling stairs with overhangs.
Modifying the geometry of the periphery of the wheels of our robot helps in
tackling overhangs. Along with establishing a concept design, robust design
parameters are set to minimize performance variation. The Grey-based Taguchi
Method is adopted for providing an optimal setting for the design parameters of
the robot. The robot prototype is shown to have successfully scaled stairs of

  averaging method for estimating mean and standard deviation",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: We proposed approximate Bayesian computation with single
distribution selection (ABC-SD) for estimating mean and standard deviation from
other reported summary statistics. The ABC-SD generates pseudo data from a
single parametric distribution thought to be the true distribution of
underlying study data. This single distribution is either an educated guess, or
it is selected via model selection using posterior probability criterion for
testing two or more candidate distributions. Further analysis indicated that
when model selection is used, posterior model probabilities are sensitive to
the prior distribution(s) for parameter(s) and dependable on the type of
reported summary statistics. Method: We propose ABC with Bayesian model
averaging (ABC-BMA) methodology to estimate mean and standard deviation based
on various sets of other summary statistics reported in published studies. We
conduct a Monte Carlo simulation study to compare the new proposed ABC-BMA
method with our previous ABC-SD method. Results: In the estimation of standard
deviation, ABC-BMA has smaller average relative errors (AREs) than that of
ABC-SD for normal, lognormal, beta, and exponential distributions. For Weibull
distribution, ARE of ABC-BMA is larger than that of ABC-SD but <0.05 in small
sample sizes and moves toward zero as sample size increases. When underlying
distribution is highly skewed and available summary statistics are only
quartiles and sample size, ABC-BMA is recommended but it should be used with
caution. Comparison of mean estimation between ABC-BMA and ABC-SD shows similar
patterns of results as for standard deviation estimation. Conclusion: ABC-BMA
is easy to implement and it performs even better than our previous ABC-SD
method for estimation of mean and standard deviation.

water, a delicate balance must be struck between the volume of water it retains
and the capacity of its perturbations. These two quantities may show
substantial variability across the full spectrum of water-bearing worlds. This
would suggest that, barring strong feedback effects, most surfaces are heavily
dominated by either water or land. Why is the Earth so finely poised? To
address this question we construct a simple model for the selection bias that
would arise within an ensemble of surface conditions. Based on the Earth's
ocean coverage of 71%, we find substantial evidence (Bayes factor K ~ 6)
supporting the hypothesis that anthropic selection effects are at work.
Furthermore, due to the Earth's proximity to the waterworld limit, this model
predicts that most habitable planets are dominated by oceans spanning over 90%
of their surface area (95% credible interval). This scenario, in which the
Earth has a much greater land area than most habitable planets, is consistent
with results from numerical simulations and could help explain the apparently

$M_{\rm str}$, to its rotation speed: it is well approximated by a power law,
shows little scatter, and evolves weakly with redshift. The relation has been
interpreted as reflecting the mass-velocity scaling ($M\propto V^3$) of dark
matter halos, but this interpretation has been called into question by
abundance-matching (AM) models, which predict the galaxy-halo mass relation to
be non-monotonic and rapidy evolving. We study the TFR of luminous spirals and
its relation to AM using the EAGLE set of $\Lambda$CDM cosmological
simulations. Matching both relations requires disk sizes to satisfy constraints
given by the concentration of halos and their response to galaxy assembly.
EAGLE galaxies approximately match these constraints and show a tight
mass-velocity scaling that compares favourably with the observed TFR. The TFR
is degenerate to changes in galaxy formation efficiency and the mass-size
relation; simulations that fail to match the galaxy stellar mass function may
fit the observed TFR if galaxies follow a different mass-size relation. The
small scatter in the simulated TFR results because, at fixed halo mass, galaxy
mass and rotation speed correlate strongly, scattering galaxies along the main
relation. EAGLE galaxies evolve with lookback time following approximately the
prescriptions of AM models and the observed mass-size relation of bright
spirals, leading to a weak TFR evolution consistent with observation out to
$z=1$. $\Lambda$CDM models that match both the abundance and size of galaxies
as a function of stellar mass have no difficulty reproducing the observed TFR
and its evolution.

transition-metal substitutions in 122, Ag diminishes the antiferromagnetic (TN)

122s, TN and TS coincide without splitting. Although magnetism drops
precipitously to TN = 84 K at doping x = 0.029, it only weakly changes above
this x, settling at TN = 80 K at x = 0.045. Compared to this persistent
magnetism in Ag-122, doping other group 11 elements of either Cu or Au in 122
diminished TN and induced superconductivity near TC = 2 K at x = 0.044 or
0.031, respectively. Ag-122 crystals show reflective surfaces with surprising
thicker cross sections for x >= 0.019, the appearance that is in contrast to
the typical thin stacked layered feature seen in all other flux-grown x122 and
lower Ag-122. This physical trait may be a manifest of intrinsic weak changes
in c-lattice and TN. Our theoretical calculations suggest that Ag doping
produces strong electronic scattering and yet a relatively small disruption of
the magnetic state, both of which preclude superconductivity in this system.

information theory. First, we show that the operational framework of thermal
operations is nonequivalent to the framework of Gibbs-preserving maps, and we
comment on this gap. We then introduce a fully information-theoretic framework
generalizing the above by making further abstraction of physical quantities
such as energy. It is technically convenient to work with and reproduces known
results for finite-size quantum thermodynamics. With our framework we may
determine the minimal work cost of implementing any logical process. In the
case of information processing on memory registers with a degenerate
Hamiltonian, the answer is given by the max-entropy, a measure of information
known from quantum information theory. In the general case, we obtain a new
information measure, the ""coherent relative entropy"", which generalizes both
the conditional entropy and the relative entropy. It satisfies a collection of
properties which justifies its interpretation as an entropy measure and which
connects it to known quantities. We then present how, from our framework,
macroscopic thermodynamics emerges by typicality, after singling out an
appropriate class of thermodynamic states possessing some suitable
reversibility property. A natural thermodynamic potential emerges, dictating
possible state transformations, and whose differential describes the physics of
the system. The textbook thermodynamics of a gas is recovered as well as the
form of the second law relating thermodynamic entropy and heat exchange.
Finally, noting that quantum states are relative to the observer, we see that
the procedure above gives rise to a natural form of coarse-graining in quantum
mechanics: Each observer can consistently apply the formalism of quantum
information according to their own fundamental unit of information.

structure, using a mass-complete sample of 27,893 galaxies at $0.5<z<2.5$
selected from 3D-HST. We confirm that star-forming galaxies are larger than
quiescent galaxies at fixed stellar mass (M$_{\star}$). However, in contrast
with some simulations, there is only a weak relation between star formation
rate (SFR) and size within the star-forming population: when dividing into
quartiles based on residual offsets in SFR, we find that the sizes of
star-forming galaxies in the lowest quartile are 0.27$\pm$0.06 dex smaller than
the highest quartile. We show that 50% of star formation in galaxies at fixed
M$_{\star}$ takes place within a narrow range of sizes (0.26 dex). Taken
together, these results suggest that there is an abrupt cessation of star
formation after galaxies attain particular structural properties. Confirming
earlier results, we find that central stellar density within a 1 kpc fixed
physical radius is the key parameter connecting galaxy morphology and star
formation histories: galaxies with high central densities are red and have
increasingly lower SFR/M$_{\star}$, whereas galaxies with low central densities
are blue and have a roughly constant (higher) SFR/M$_{\star}$ at a given
redshift. We find remarkably little scatter in the average trends and a strong
evolution of $>$0.5 dex in the central density threshold correlated with
quiescence from $z\sim0.7-2.0$. Neither a compact size nor high-$n$ are
sufficient to assess the likelihood of quiescence for the average galaxy;
rather, the combination of these two parameters together with M$_{\star}$
results in a unique quenching threshold in central density/velocity.

complex structure with a spatially-varying double peaked Ly-alpha emission.
Overall, the spectral profiles of the two Ly-alpha nebulae are remarkably
similar, both showing a prominent blue emission, more intense and slightly
broader than the red peak. From the first nebula, located in the HUDF, no X-ray
emission has been detected, disfavoring the possible presence of AGNs.
Spectroscopic redshifts have been derived for 11 galaxies within two arcsec
from the nebula and spanning the redshift range 1.037<z<5.97. The second
nebula, behind MACSJ0416, shows three aligned star-forming galaxies plausibly
associated to the emitting gas. In both systems, the associated galaxies reveal
possible intense rest-frame-optical nebular emissions lines
[OIII]4959-5007+Hbeta with equivalent widths as high as 1500A rest-frame and
star formation rates ranging from a few to tens of solar masses per year. A
possible scenario is that of a group of young, star-forming galaxies sources of
escaping ionising radiation that induce Ly-alpha fluorescence, therefore
revealing the kinematics of the surrounding gas. Also Ly-alpha powered by
star-formation and/or cooling radiation may resemble the double peaked spectral
properties and the morphology observed here. If the intense blue emission is
associated with inflowing gas, then we may be witnessing an early phase of
galaxy or a proto-cluster (or group) formation.

waves and are under intensive investigations. One crucial ingredient in their
modeling has so far been neglected. Pair-instability pulsation supernovae with
associated severe mass loss may suppress formation of massive black holes,
decreasing black hole merger rates for the highest black hole masses.
  The mass loss associated with pair-instability pulsation supernovae limits
the Population I/II stellar-origin black hole mass to 50 Msun, in tension with

mechanism regulating their formation. Detailed simulation of massive star
formation therefore requires an accurate treatment of radiation. However, all
published simulations have either used a diffusion approximation of limited
validity; have only been able to simulate a single star fixed in space, thereby
suppressing potentially-important instabilities; or did not provide adequate
resolution at locations where instabilities may develop. To remedy this we have
developed a new, highly accurate radiation algorithm that properly treats the
absorption of the direct radiation field from stars and the re-emission and
processing by interstellar dust. We use our new tool to perform
three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the collapse of massive
pre-stellar cores with laminar and turbulent initial conditions and properly
resolve regions where we expect instabilities to grow. We find that mass is
channeled to the stellar system via gravitational and Rayleigh-Taylor (RT)
instabilities, in agreement with previous results using stars capable of
moving, but in disagreement with methods where the star is held fixed or with
simulations that do not adequately resolve the development of RT instabilities.
For laminar initial conditions, proper treatment of the direct radiation field
produces later onset of instability, but does not suppress it entirely provided
the edges of radiation-dominated bubbles are adequately resolved. Instabilities
arise immediately for turbulent pre-stellar cores because the initial
turbulence seeds the instabilities. Our results suggest that RT features are
significant and should be present around accreting massive stars throughout
their formation.

non-existence of entropy in the latter sense. We explicate, clarify and extend
the proofs of these theorems to some standard matter (scalar and
electromagnetic) field theories in curved spacetime, and then we show why these

As a concrete application, we focus on the consequences of these results for
the gravitational two-body problem, and in particular, we prove the

E$_{8(8)}$ exceptional field theory -- the manifestly U-duality covariant
formulation of the untruncated ten- and eleven-dimensional supergravities. This
theory is formulated on a (3+248) dimensional spacetime (modulo section
constraint) in which the extended coordinates transform in the adjoint
representation of E$_{8(8)}$. All bosonic fields are E$_{8(8)}$ tensors and
transform under internal generalized diffeomorphisms. The fermions are tensors
under the generalized Lorentz group SO(1,2)$\times$SO(16), where SO(16) is the
maximal compact subgroup of E$_{8(8)}$. Vanishing generalized torsion
determines the corresponding spin connections to the extent they are required
to formulate the field equations and supersymmetry transformation laws. We
determine the supersymmetry transformations for all bosonic and fermionic
fields such that they consistently close into generalized diffeomorphisms. In
particular, the covariantly constrained gauge vectors of E$_{8(8)}$ exceptional
field theory combine with the standard supergravity fields into a single
supermultiplet. We give the complete extended Lagrangian and show its
invariance under supersymmetry. Upon solution of the section constraint the
theory reduces to full D=11 or type IIB supergravity.

10^5 < M_{*}/{\rm M}_\odot < 10^{8}$. By accounting for cusp-core
transformations due to stellar feedback, we find a monotonic relation with
little scatter. Such monotonicity implies that abundance matching should yield
a similar $M_*-M_{200}$ if the cosmological model is correct. Using the 'field
galaxy' stellar mass function from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the
halo mass function from the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter Bolshoi simulation, we
find remarkable agreement between the two. This holds down to $M_{200} \sim 5

assume a power law extrapolation of the SDSS stellar mass function below $M_*

  However, if instead of SDSS we use the stellar mass function of nearby galaxy
groups, then the agreement is poor. This occurs because the group stellar mass
function is shallower than that of the field below $M_* \sim 10^9$M$_\odot$,
recovering the familiar 'missing satellites' and 'too big to fail' problems.
Our result demonstrates that both problems are confined to group environments
and must, therefore, owe to 'galaxy formation physics' rather than exotic
cosmology.
  Finally, we repeat our analysis for a $\Lambda$ Warm Dark Matter cosmology,
finding that it fails at 68% confidence for a thermal relic mass of $m_{\rm
WDM} < 1.25$keV, and $m_{\rm WDM} < 2$keV if we use the power law extrapolation
of SDSS. We conclude by making a number of predictions for future surveys based

of rank one amplification matrix, the rate maximization problem is equivalently
simplified into an unconstrained problem which can be locally solved using

difficult equality constraints in addition to some convex constraints. By
rewriting the rate maximization problem with a set of auxiliary variables, we
apply the P-BSUM algorithm to the rate maximization problem in the general

properties of a star or stellar group, such as age and evolutionary history, as
well as the composition of an orbiting planet. However, as abundance
measurement techniques have progressed, there has been little standardization
between individual methods and their comparisons. As a result, different
stellar abundance procedures determine measurements that vary beyond quoted
error for the same elements within the same stars (Hinkel et al. 2014). The
purpose of this paper is to better understand the systematic variations between
methods and offer recommendations for producing more accurate results in the
future. We have invited a number of participants from around the world
(Australia, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and USA) to calculate ten element
abundances (C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Fe, Ni, Ba, and Eu) using the same stellar
spectra for four stars (HD361, HD10700, HD121504, HD202206). Each group
produced measurements for each of the stars using: 1) their own autonomous
techniques, 2) standardized stellar parameters, 3) standardized line list, and
4) both standardized parameters and line list. We present the resulting stellar
parameters, absolute abundances, and a metric of data similarity that
quantifies homogeneity of the data. We conclude that standardization of some
kind, particularly stellar parameters, improves the consistency between
methods. However, because results did not converge as more free parameters were
standardized, it is clear there are inherent issues within the techniques that
need to be reconciled. Therefore, we encourage more conversation and
transparency within the community such that stellar abundance determinations
can be reproducible as well as accurate and precise.

  Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The density of a code is the fraction of the coding space covered by packing
balls centered around the codewords. This paper investigates the density of
codes in the complex Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds equipped with the chordal
distance. The choice of distance enables the treatment of the manifolds as
subspaces of Euclidean hyperspheres. In this geometry, the densest packings are
not necessarily equivalent to maximum-minimum-distance codes. Computing a
code's density follows from computing: i) the normalized volume of a metric
ball and ii) the kissing radius, the radius of the largest balls one can pack
around the codewords without overlapping. First, the normalized volume of a
metric ball is evaluated by asymptotic approximations. The volume of a small
ball can be well-approximated by the volume of a locally-equivalent tangential
ball. In order to properly normalize this approximation, the precise volumes of
the manifolds induced by their spherical embedding are computed. For larger
balls, a hyperspherical cap approximation is used, which is justified by a
volume comparison theorem showing that the normalized volume of a ball in the
Stiefel or Grassmann manifold is asymptotically equal to the normalized volume
of a ball in its embedding sphere as the dimension grows to infinity. Then,
bounds on the kissing radius are derived alongside corresponding bounds on the
density. Unlike spherical codes or codes in flat spaces, the kissing radius of
Grassmann or Stiefel codes cannot be exactly determined from its minimum
distance. It is nonetheless possible to derive bounds on density as functions
of the minimum distance. Stiefel and Grassmann codes have larger density than
their image spherical codes when dimensions tend to infinity. Finally, the
bounds on density lead to refinements of the standard Hamming bounds for
Stiefel and Grassmann codes.

behind the transit light curve and the Rossiter- McLaughlin effect

expected to be affected by the occultation of stellar active regions in a
similar way. In this paper we perform a fundamental test on the spin-orbit
angles as derived by Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements, and we examine the
impact of the occultation of stellar active regions by the transiting planet on
the spin-orbit angle estimations. Our results show that the inaccurate
estimation on the spin-orbit angle due to stellar activity can be quite
significant (up to 30 degrees), particularly for the edge-on, aligned, and
small transiting planets. Therefore, our results suggest that the aligned
transiting planets are the ones that can be easily misinterpreted as misaligned

coisotropic (or pre-Lagrangian) embeddings, which in turn leads to a proof of
$C^0$-rigidity of contact embeddings and diffeomorphisms. We give a detailed
treatment of the shape invariants of symplectic and contact manifolds, and
demonstrate that shape is often a natural language in symplectic and contact
topology. We consider homeomorphisms that preserve shape, and propose a
hierarchy of notions of Lagrangian topological submanifold. Moreover, we
discuss shape related necessary and sufficient conditions for symplectic and
contact embeddings, and define a symplectic capacity from the shape.

lensing shear measurements, depends on contributions to the covariance induced
by the nonlinear evolution of the cosmic web. As nonlinear clustering to date
has only been described by numerical $N$-body simulations in a reliable and
sufficiently precise way, the necessary computational costs for estimating
those covariances at different points in parameter space are tremendous. In
this work we describe the change of the matter covariance and of the weak
lensing covariance matrix as a function of cosmological parameters by
constructing a suitable basis, where we model the contribution to the
covariance from nonlinear structure formation using Eulerian perturbation
theory at third order. We show that our formalism is capable of dealing with
large matrices and reproduces expected degeneracies and scaling with
cosmological parameters in a reliable way. Comparing our analytical results to
numerical simulations we find that the method describes the variation of the
covariance matrix found in the SUNGLASS weak lensing simulation pipeline within
the errors at one-loop and tree-level for the spectrum and the trispectrum,
respectively, for multipoles up to $\ell\leq 1300$. We show that it is possible
to optimize the sampling of parameter space where numerical simulations should
be carried out by minimising interpolation errors and propose a corresponding
method to distribute points in parameter space in an economical way.

achieve significant energy savings; at the same time, these technologies

present a framework for modeling the trade-off between improved control

specifically, we consider occupancy-based HVAC control as the control objective
and the location traces of individual occupants as the private variables.
Previous studies have shown that individual location information can be
inferred from occupancy measurements. To ensure privacy, we design an
architecture that distorts the occupancy data in order to hide individual
occupant location information while maintaining HVAC performance. Using mutual
information between the individual's location trace and the reported occupancy
measurement as a privacy metric, we are able to optimally design a scheme to
minimize privacy risk subject to a control performance guarantee. We evaluate
our framework using real-world occupancy data: first, we verify that our
privacy metric accurately assesses the adversary's ability to infer private
variables from the distorted sensor measurements; then, we show that control
performance is maintained through simulations of building operations using
these distorted occupancy readings.

novel approaches to describe non-linear evolution, bias, and redshift-space
distortions, which we test using synthetic catalogues based on large-volume

$2.9\%$ and $2.3\%$ constraints on $H(z)$ for the low ($\zeff=0.38$) and high
($\zeff=0.61$) redshift bin, respectively. We obtain two independent $1\%$ and
$0.9\%$ constraints on the angular averaged distance $D_V(z)$, when ignoring
the Alcock-Paczynski effect. The detection significance of the BAO signal is of
the order of $8\sigma$ (post-reconstruction) for each of the three redshift
bins. Our results are in good agreement with the Planck prediction within
$\Lambda$CDM. This paper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy

minimizing informative priors in the estimation of cosmological parameters. We
extract the dark-energy-model-independent cosmological constraints from the
joint data sets of Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) galaxy sample
and Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurement. We measure the mean
values and covariance matrix of $\{R$, $l_a$, $\Omega_b h^2$, $n_s$,
$log(A_s)$, $\Omega_k$, $H(z)$, $D_A(z)$, $f(z)\sigma_8(z)\}$, which give an
efficient summary of Planck data and 2-point statistics from BOSS galaxy
sample, where $R=\sqrt{\Omega_m H_0^2}\,r(z_*)$, and $l_a=\pi r(z_*)/r_s(z_*)$,
$z_*$ is the redshift at the last scattering surface, and $r(z_*)$ and
$r_s(z_*)$ denote our comoving distance to $z_*$ and sound horizon at $z_*$
respectively. The advantage of this method is that we do not need to put
informative priors on the cosmological parameters that galaxy clustering is not
able to constrain well, i.e. $\Omega_b h^2$ and $n_s$. Using our double-probe
results, we obtain $\Omega_m=0.304\pm0.009$, $H_0=68.2\pm0.7$, and

flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological paradigm. By comparing with the full-likelihood
analyses with fixed dark energy models, we demonstrate that the double-probe
method provides robust cosmological parameter constraints which can be
conveniently used to study dark energy models. We extend our study to measure
the sum of neutrino mass and obtain $\Sigma m_\nu<0.10/0.22$ (68\%/95\%)

over an effective area of 9329 deg^2 and volume of 18.7 Gpc^3, divided into

0.38, 0.51, and 0.61. We measure the angular diameter distance DM and Hubble
parameter H from the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) method after applying
reconstruction to reduce non-linear effects on the BAO feature. Using the
anisotropic clustering of the pre-reconstruction density field, we measure the
product DM*H from the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and the growth of structure,
quantified by f{\sigma}8(z), from redshift-space distortions (RSD). We combine
measurements presented in seven companion papers into a set of consensus values
and likelihoods, obtaining constraints that are tighter and more robust than
those from any one method. Combined with Planck 2015 cosmic microwave
background measurements, our distance scale measurements simultaneously imply
curvature {\Omega}_K =0.0003+/-0.0026 and a dark energy equation of state
parameter w = -1.01+/-0.06, in strong affirmation of the spatially flat cold
dark matter model with a cosmological constant ({\Lambda}CDM). Our RSD
measurements of f{\sigma}_8, at 6 per cent precision, are similarly consistent
with this model. When combined with supernova Ia data, we find H0 = 67.3+/-1.0
km/s/Mpc even for our most general dark energy model, in tension with some
direct measurements. Adding extra relativistic species as a degree of freedom
loosens the constraint only slightly, to H0 = 67.8+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc. Assuming
flat {\Lambda}CDM we find {\Omega}_m = 0.310+/-0.005 and H0 = 67.6+/-0.5
km/s/Mpc, and we find a 95% upper limit of 0.16 eV/c^2 on the neutrino mass

limit of the CQME in which only a cubic nonlinearity in the fast saturable
absorber is kept in the model. Here, we use singular perturbation theory to
demonstrate that the CQME has a stable high-energy solution for an arbitrarily
small but non-zero quintic contribution to the fast saturable absorber. As a
consequence, we find that the CQME predicts the existence of stable modelocked
pulses when the cubic nonlinearity is orders of magnitude larger than the value
at which the HME predicts that modelocked pulses become unstable. This
intrinsically larger stability range is consistent with experiments. Our
results suggest a possible path to obtain high-energy and ultrashort pulses by

using \textit{ab initio} density functional theory (DFT) crystal structure

ranging from Li$_{12}$C to LiC$_{12}$ at 0 GPa as well as 40 GPa. Based on
formation enthalpies from optimized van der Waals density functional
calculations, three thermodynamically stable phases (Li$_4$C$_3$, Li$_2$C$_2$
and LiC$_{12}$) were identified at 0 GPa, and seven thermodynamically stable
phases (Li$_8$C, Li$_6$C, Li$_4$C, Li$_8$C$_3$, Li$_2$C, Li$_3$C$_4$, and
Li$_2$C$_3$) were predicted at 40 GPa. A rich diversity of carbon bonding,

found within these structures, and the dimensionality of carbon connectivity
existing within each phase was observed to increase with increasing carbon
concentration. Of particular interest, we find that the well-known composition

higher than second order, we study the role of a spatial component $v$ of a
massive vector field on the anisotropic cosmological background. We show that,
as in the case of the isotropic cosmological background, there is no additional
ghostly degrees of freedom associated with the Ostrogradski instability. In
second-order generalized Proca theories we find the existence of anisotropic
solutions on which the ratio between the anisotropic expansion rate $\Sigma$
and the isotropic expansion rate $H$ remains nearly constant in the
radiation-dominated epoch. In the regime where $\Sigma/H$ is constant, the
spatial vector component $v$ works as a dark radiation with the equation of
state close to $1/3$. During the matter era, the ratio $\Sigma/H$ decreases
with the decrease of $v$. As long as the conditions $|\Sigma| \ll H$ and $v^2
\ll \phi^2$ are satisfied around the onset of late-time cosmic acceleration,
where $\phi$ is the temporal vector component, we find that the solutions
approach the isotropic de Sitter fixed point ($\Sigma=0=v$) in accordance with
the cosmic no-hair conjecture. In the presence of $v$ and $\Sigma$ the early
evolution of the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ in the radiation
era is different from that in the isotropic case, but the approach to the
isotropic value $w_{\rm DE}^{{\rm (iso)}}$ typically occurs at redshifts $z$
much larger than 1. Thus, apart from the existence of dark radiation, the
anisotropic cosmological dynamics at low redshifts is similar to that in
isotropic generalized Proca theories. In beyond-generalized Proca theories the
only consistent solution to avoid the divergence of a determinant of the
dynamical system corresponds to $v=0$, so $\Sigma$ always decreases in time.

factors, where due to the Stuckelberg mechanism only a diagonal U(1) factor
remains massless, and thus after Higgsing only a diagonal discrete symmetry of

probability that a random paper in one journal has more citations than a random
paper in another journal (50% means the two journals do equally well). Unlike
the journal impact factor (IF), the citation success index depends on the
broadness and the shape of citation distributions. Also, it is insensitive to
sporadic highly-cited papers that skew the IF. Nevertheless, we show, based on
16,000 journals containing ~2.4 million articles, that the citation success
index is a relatively tight function of the ratio of IFs of journals being
compared, due to the fact that journals with same IF have quite similar
citation distributions. The citation success index grows slowly as a function
of IF ratio. It is substantial (>90%) only when the ratio of IFs exceeds ~6,

advantage for the journal with higher IF (index of ~70%). We facilitate the
wider adoption of this metric by providing an online calculator that takes as

variational methods to get algorithms for calculating partition functions in

for the partition function beyond the regime of correlation decay. They also
generalize some classical results from statistical physics about the
Curie-Weiss ferromagnetic Ising model, as well as provide a partition function
counterpart of classical results about max-cut on dense graphs
\cite{arora1995polynomial}. With this, we connect techniques from two
apparently disparate research areas -- optimization and counting/partition
function approximations. (i.e. \#-P type of problems).
  Furthermore, we design to the best of our knowledge the first provable,
convex variational methods. Though in the literature there are a host of convex
versions of variational methods \cite{wainwright2003tree, wainwright2005new,
heskes2006convexity, meshi2009convexifying}, they come with no guarantees
(apart from some extremely special cases, like e.g. the graph has a single
cycle \cite{weiss2000correctness}). We consider dense and low threshold rank
graphs, and interestingly, the reason our approach works on these types of
graphs is because local correlations propagate to global correlations --
completely the opposite of algorithms based on correlation decay. In the
process we design novel entropy approximations based on the low-order moments
of a distribution.
  Our proof techniques are very simple and generic, and likely to be applicable
to many other settings other than Ising models.

resonance in $B_s\pi^+$ as well as a deeply bound $B^+\bar K^0$ would lead to
distinct signatures in the energies of lattice eigenstates, which are not seen

interactions bear a cost for involved individuals has been considered seldom.
The introduction of costly interactions leads, instead, to the formulation of a
dichotomous scenario in which an individual may decide to cooperate and pay the
cost in order to get synchronized with the rest of the population.
Alternatively, the same individual can decide to free ride, without incurring
in any cost, waiting that others get synchronized to her state. The emergence
of synchronization may thus be seen as the byproduct of an evolutionary game in
which individuals decide their behavior according to the benefit/cost ratio
they accrue in the past. We study the onset of cooperation/synchronization in
networked populations of Kuramoto oscillators and report how topology is
essential in order for cooperation to thrive. We display also how different
classes of topology foster differently synchronization both at a microscopic
and macroscopic level.

semistable elliptic surfaces, with $12n$ nodal singular fibers and a
distinguished section. We establish a bijection of $K$-points between the

Deligne-Mumford stack of stable elliptic curves and $K$ is any field of

projective stack, is equal to $\mathbb{L}^{(a+b)n+1}-\mathbb{L}^{(a+b)n-1}$.
Consequently, we find that the motive of the moduli $\mathcal{L}_{1,12n}$ is
$\mathbb{L}^{10n + 1}-\mathbb{L}^{10n - 1}$ and the cardinality of the set of
weighted $\mathbb{F}_q$-points to be $\#_q(\mathcal{L}_{1,12n}) = q^{10n +

property which is known to inhibit rapid convergence) the Zig-Zag process
offers a flexible non-reversible alternative which we observe to often have
favourable convergence properties. We show how the Zig-Zag process can be
simulated without discretisation error, and give conditions for the process to
be ergodic. Most importantly, we introduce a sub-sampling version of the
Zig-Zag process that is an example of an {\em exact approximate scheme}, i.e.
the resulting approximate process still has the posterior as its stationary
distribution. Furthermore, if we use a control-variate idea to reduce the
variance of our unbiased estimator, then the Zig-Zag process can be
super-efficient: after an initial pre-processing step, essentially independent
samples from the posterior distribution are obtained at a computational cost

upon previous work, the approach described is suitable for the long term

makes use of a previously defined Hybrid State System and Hidden Markov Model
(HSS+HMM) system which has provided good results for driver behavior
estimation. The HSS+HMM system utilizes the hybrid characteristics of
decision-behavior coupling of many systems such as the driver and the vehicle,
uses Kalman Filter estimates of observable parameters to track the
instantaneous continuous state, and estimates the most likely driver state. The
HSS+HMM system is encompassed in a HSS structure and inter-system connectivity
is determined by using Signal Processing and Pattern Recognition techniques.
The proposed method is suitable for scenarios that involve unknown decisions of
other individuals, such as lane changes or intersection precedence/access. The
long term driver behavior estimation system involves an extended HSS+HMM
structure that is capable of including external information in the estimation
process. Through the grafting and pruning of metastates, the HSS+HMM system can
be dynamically updated to best represent driver choices given external
information. Three application examples are also provided to elucidate the
theoretical system.

scattering on the AF fluctuations is that it is strongly enhanced at the Fermi
surface locations where the nesting is perfect (""hot spots"" or ""hot lines""). We
review derivation of the collision integral for the Boltzmann equation due to
AF-fluctuations scattering. In the paramagnetic state, the enhanced scattering
rate near the hot lines leads to anomalous behavior of electronic transport in
magnetic field. We explore this behavior by analytically solving Boltzmann
transport equation with approximate transition rates. This approach accounts
for return scattering events and is more accurate than the relaxation-time
approximation. The magnetic-field dependences are characterized by two very
different field scales, the lower scale is set by the hot-spot width and the
higher scale is set by the total scattering amplitude. A conventional
magnetotransport behavior is limited to magnetic fields below the lower scale.
In the wide range in between these two scales the longitudinal conductivity has
linear dependence on the magnetic field and the Hall conductivity has quadratic
dependence. The linear dependence of the diagonal component reflects growth of
the Fermi-surface area affected by hot spots proportional to the magnetic
field. We discuss applicability of this theoretical framework for describing of
anomalous magnetotransport properties in different iron pnictides and selenides

sciences, often compromising our ability to make accurate inferences. An
outcome is said to be missing not at random (MNAR) if, conditional on the
observed variables, the missing data mechanism still depends on the unobserved
outcome. In such settings, identification is generally not possible without
imposing additional assumptions. Identification is sometimes possible, however,
if an instrumental variable (IV) is observed for all subjects which satisfies
the exclusion restriction that the IV affects the missingness process without
directly influencing the outcome. In this paper, we provide necessary and
sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification of the full data
distribution under MNAR with the aid of an IV. In addition, we give sufficient
identification conditions that are more straightforward to verify in practice.
For inference, we focus on estimation of a population outcome mean, for which
we develop a suite of semiparametric estimators that extend methods previously
developed for data missing at random. Specifically, we propose inverse
probability weighted estimation, outcome regression-based estimation and doubly
robust estimation of the mean of an outcome subject to MNAR. For illustration,
the methods are used to account for selection bias induced by HIV testing

While the individual phenacene molecules are modeled by the Pariser-Parr-Pople
Hamiltonian with long range Coulomb interactions, we derive a correlated
minimal model for describing the phenacene ionic crystals. We find that long
range electron correlations do not change the behavior of the phenacene ions
with molecular valence $-1$ (monoanion) and $-2$ (dianion), compared to that
observed for short range electron interactions. The monoanion crystal is a
single-band $\frac{1}{2}$-filled antiferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard semiconductor
while the dianion crystal is a two-band semiconductor with inter-molecular
antiferromagnetic and intra-molecular ferromagnetic spin orderings. However,
the trianion crystal is no longer a nearly degenerate $\frac{3}{4}$-filled
two-band system. We show that this occurs because the kinetic stability of the
$\frac{3}{4}$-filled two-band system with long range correlations is smaller
compared to that with short range correlations, for the lattice sizes
considered in this study. We argue that with large finite lattices, behavior of
the trianion crystal with long range correlations will be same as that with
short range correlations. We thus conclude that long range correlations fail to
alter the normal states of metal-intercalated phenacene crystals.

of 7,796 worldwide companies for the period 2004 through 2013. We develop a
panel regression model using three financial indicators--dividends per share,
cash flow per share, and book value per share--as explanatory variables for
share price. We then estimate individual company fundamentals for each year by
removing the time fixed effects from the two-way fixed effects model, which we
identified as the best of the panel regression models. One merit of our model
is that we are able to extract unobservable factors of company fundamentals by
using the individual fixed effects.
  Based on these results, we analyze the market anomaly quantitatively using
the divergence rate--the rate of the deviation of share price from a company's
fundamentals. We find that share prices on average were overvalued in the
period from 2005 to 2007, and were undervalued significantly in 2008, when the
global financial crisis occurred. Share prices were equivalent to the
fundamentals on average in the subsequent period. Our empirical results clearly
demonstrate that the worldwide stock market fluctuated excessively in the time
period before and just after the global financial crisis of 2008.

time-varying graphs. For the case of undirected graphs, we introduce a
distributed algorithm, referred to as DIGing, based on a combination of a
distributed inexact gradient method and a gradient tracking technique. The
DIGing algorithm uses doubly stochastic mixing matrices and employs fixed
step-sizes and, yet, drives all the agents' iterates to a global and consensual
minimizer. When the graphs are directed, in which case the implementation of
doubly stochastic mixing matrices is unrealistic, we construct an algorithm
that incorporates the push-sum protocol into the DIGing structure, thus
obtaining Push-DIGing algorithm. The Push-DIGing uses column stochastic
matrices and fixed step-sizes, but it still converges to a global and
consensual minimizer. Under the strong convexity assumption, we prove that the
algorithms converge at R-linear (geometric) rates as long as the step-sizes do
not exceed some upper bounds. We establish explicit estimates for the
convergence rates. When the graph is undirected it shows that DIGing scales
polynomially in the number of agents. We also provide some numerical
experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and to
validate our theoretical findings.

over-density regions. We define our algorithm formally based on pair
enumeration, a problem that has been heavily studied in fast 2-point
correlation codes and our reference implementation employs a dual KD-tree
correlation function code. We construct features in a hierarchical tree
structure, and use a splay operation to reduce the average cost of identifying
the root of a feature from $O[\log L]$ to $O[1]$ ($L$ is the size of a feature)
without additional memory costs. This reduces the overall time complexity of
merging trees from $O[L\log L]$ to $O[L]$, reducing the number of operations
per splay by orders of magnitude. We next introduce a pruning operation that
skips merge operations between two fully self-connected KD-tree nodes. This
improves the robustness of the algorithm, reducing the number of merge
operations in high density peaks from $O[\delta^2]$ to $O[\delta]$. We show
that for cosmological data set the algorithm eliminates more than half of merge
operations for typically used linking lengths $b \sim 0.2$ (relative to mean
separation). Furthermore, our algorithm is extremely simple and easy to
implement on top of an existing pair enumeration code, reusing the optimization
effort that has been invested in fast correlation function codes.

recognition method to deal with pose and illumination simultaneously based on
convolutional networks where the discriminative nonlinear features that are
invariant to pose and illumination are extracted. Normally the global structure

use the 1*1 convolutional kernel to extract the local features. Furthermore the
parallel multi-stream multi-layer 1*1 convolution network is developed to
extract multi-hierarchy features. In the experiments we obtained the average

state-of-the-art of face recognition across poses and illumination by 7.5%.
Especially for profile-wise positions, the average recognition rate of our

the system energy efficiency (EE) of the SC while guaranteeing the quality of
service (QoS) of each MU as well as small cell users (SUs). Specifically, given
the minimum data rate requirement and the bandwidth provided by the MC, the SC
jointly optimizes MU selection, bandwidth allocation, and power allocation
while guaranteeing its own minimum required system data rate. The problem is
challenging due to the binary MU selection variables and the fractional form
objective function. We first show that in order to achieve the maximum system
EE, the bandwidth of an MU is shared with at most one SU in the SC. Then, for a
given MU selection, the optimal bandwidth and power allocations are obtained by
exploiting the fractional programming. To perform MU selection, we first
introduce the concept of trading EE. Then, we reveal a sufficient and necessary
condition for serving an MU without considering the total power constraint and
the minimum data rate constraint. Based on this insight, we propose a low
computational complexity MU selection algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

developments reveal that the ground states and low-energy physics of frustrated
spin systems may develop many exotic behaviors once we leave the regime of
semi-classical approaches. The purpose of this article is to introduce these
developments. The article begins by explaining how semi-classical approaches
fail once quantum mechanics become important and then describes the alternative
approaches for addressing the problem. We discuss mainly spin $1/2$ systems,
and we spend most of our time in this article on one particular set of
plausible spin liquid states in which spins are represented by fermions. These
states are spin-singlet states and may be viewed as an extension of Fermi
liquid states to Mott insulators, and they are usually classified in the
category of so-called $SU(2)$, $U(1)$ or $Z_2$ spin liquid states. We review
the basic theory regarding these states and the extensions of these states to
include the effect of spin-orbit coupling and to higher spin ($S>1/2$) systems.
Two other important approaches with strong influences on the understanding of
spin liquid states are also introduced: (i) matrix product states and projected
entangled pair states and (ii) the Kitaev honeycomb model. Experimental
progress concerning spin liquid states in realistic materials, including
anisotropic triangular lattice systems ($\kappa$-(ET)$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$(CN)$_{3}$

atmospheres are inherently ""3D"" in their structure and composition. We explore
the potential biases resulting from standard ""1D"" assumptions within a Bayesian
atmospheric retrieval framework. Specifically, we show how the assumption of a
single 1-dimensional thermal profile can bias our interpretation of the thermal
emission spectrum of a hot Jupiter atmosphere that is composed of two thermal
profiles. We retrieve upon spectra of unresolved model planets as observed with
a combination of $HST$ WFC3+$Spitzer$ IRAC as well as $JWST$ under varying
differences in the two thermal profiles. For WFC3+IRAC, there is a
significantly biased estimate of CH$_4$ abundance using a 1D model when the
contrast is 80%. For $JWST$, two thermal profiles are required to adequately
interpret the data and estimate the abundances when contrast is greater than
40%. We also apply this preliminary concept to the recent WFC3+IRAC phase curve
data of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b. We see similar behavior as present in our
simulated data: while the H$_2$O abundance determination is robust, CH$_4$ is
artificially well-constrained to incorrect values under the 1D assumption. Our
work demonstrates the need to evaluate model assumptions in order to extract
meaningful constraints from atmospheric spectra and motivates exploration of
optimal observational setups.

The measurements cannot simply be tried in sequence, because early measurements
may disturb the state being tested. One procedure is based on a variant of
Marriott-Watrous amplification. The other procedure is based on the use of a
test for this disturbance, which is applied with low probability. We find a
number of applications. First, quantum query complexity separations in the
property testing model for testing isomorphism of functions under group
actions. We give quantum algorithms for testing isomorphism, linear isomorphism
and affine isomorphism of boolean functions which use exponentially fewer
queries than is possible classically, and a quantum algorithm for testing graph
isomorphism which uses polynomially fewer queries than the best algorithm
known. Second, testing properties of quantum states and operations. We show
that any finite property of quantum states can be tested using a number of
copies of the state which is logarithmic in the size of the property, and give
a test for genuine multipartite entanglement of states of n qubits that uses
O(n) copies of the state. Third, correcting an error in a result of Aaronson on
de-Merlinizing quantum protocols. This result claimed that, in any one-way
quantum communication protocol where two parties are assisted by an
all-powerful but untrusted third party, the third party can be removed with

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to improve performance. The amount of thread
level parallelism present in the GPU is limited by the number of resident
threads, which in turn depends on the availability of scratchpad memory in its
streaming multiprocessor (SM). Since the scratchpad memory is allocated at
thread block granularity, part of the memory may remain unutilized. In this
paper, we propose architectural and compiler optimizations to improve the
scratchpad utilization. Our approach, Scratchpad Sharing, addresses scratchpad
under-utilization by launching additional thread blocks in each SM. These
thread blocks use unutilized scratchpad and also share scratchpad with other
resident blocks. To improve the performance of scratchpad sharing, we propose
Owner Warp First (OWF) scheduling that schedules warps from the additional
thread blocks effectively. The performance of this approach, however, is
limited by the availability of the shared part of scratchpad.
  We propose compiler optimizations to improve the availability of shared
scratchpad. We describe a scratchpad allocation scheme that helps in allocating
scratchpad variables such that shared scratchpad is accessed for short
duration. We introduce a new instruction, relssp, that when executed, releases
the shared scratchpad. Finally, we describe an analysis for optimal placement
of relssp instructions such that shared scratchpad is released as early as
possible.

different (complementary) morphology while showing the same kinematics toward

H$_2$ column density N(H$_2$) map from the Herschel satellite, we find that
these two molecules trace different environmental conditions in the surrounding
of L1544: the $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ distribution peaks close to the southern part of
the core, where the surrounding molecular cloud has a N(H$_2$) sharp edge,
while CH$_3$OH mainly traces the northern part of the core, where N(H$_2$)
presents a shallower tail. We conclude that this is evidence of chemical
differentiation driven by different amount of illumination from the
interstellar radiation field: in the South, photochemistry maintains more C
atoms in the gas phase allowing carbon chain (such as $c$-C$_3$H$_2$)
production; in the North, C is mainly locked in CO and methanol traces the zone
where CO starts to freeze out significantly. During the process of cloud
contraction, different gas and ice compositions are thus expected to mix toward

critical challenge is to enable an application development for IoTSP
applications with effectively and efficiently from various stakeholders.
Several approaches to tackling this challenge have been proposed in the fields
of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Pervasive Computing, regarded as
precursors to the modern day of IoTSP. However, existing approaches only cover
limited subsets of the above mentioned challenges when applied to the IoTSP. In
view of this, we have built upon existing framework and evolved it into a
framework for developing IoTSP applications, with substantial additions and
enhancements in high-level modeling languages and their integration into the
framework, and we present a comparative evaluation results with existing
approaches. This provides the IoTSP community for further benchmarking. The
evaluation is carried out on real devices exhibiting heterogeneity. Our
experimental analysis and results demonstrate that our approach drastically
reduces development effort for IoTSP applications compared to existing

attention since Monod's pioneering study. Theoretical and experimental work has
uncovered several laws for describing the log growth phase, in which the number
of cells grows exponentially. However, microorganism growth also exhibits lag,
stationary, and death phases under starvation conditions, in which cell growth
is highly suppressed, while quantitative laws or theories for such phases are
underdeveloped. In fact, models commonly adopted for the log phase that consist
of autocatalytic chemical components, including ribosomes, can only show
exponential growth or decay in a population, and phases that halt growth are
not realized. Here, we propose a simple, coarse-grained cell model that
includes inhibitor molecule species in addition to the autocatalytic active
protein. The inhibitor forms a complex with active proteins to suppress the
catalytic process. Depending on the nutrient condition, the model exhibits the
typical transition among the lag, log, stationary, and death phases.
Furthermore, the lag time needed for growth recovery after starvation follows
the square root of the starvation time and is inverse to the maximal growth
rate, in agreement with experimental observations. Moreover, the distribution
of lag time among cells shows an exponential tail, also consistent with
experiments. Our theory further predicts strong dependence of lag time upon the
speed of substrate depletion, which should be examined experimentally. The
present model and theoretical analysis provide universal growth laws beyond the
log phase, offering insight into how cells halt growth without entering the
death phase.

we demonstrate for a bacterial reaction centre protein that long-lived coherent

stabilizes an insulating phase with a gap controlled by the conversion term --
\textit{the Feshbach insulator} -- instead of a standard Mott insulating phase.
Depending on the detuning between atoms and molecules, this model exhibits
three phases: the Feshbach insulator, a molecular condensate coexisting with
non condensed atoms and a mixed atomic-molecular condensate. Employing a
finite-size scaling method, we observe 3D XY (3D Ising) transition when $U(1)$

we introduce network trimming which iteratively optimizes the network by
pruning unimportant neurons based on analysis of their outputs on a large

significant portion of neurons in a large network are mostly zero, regardless
of what inputs the network received. These zero activation neurons are
redundant, and can be removed without affecting the overall accuracy of the
network. After pruning the zero activation neurons, we retrain the network
using the weights before pruning as initialization. We alternate the pruning

executed in parallel are essential to compute fine level samples in 3D, whereas
to compute individual coarse level samples only moderate numbers of processors

  We address this problem by presenting Neighborhood extensible WLAN (NxWLAN)
which enables the secure extension of user's home WLANs through usage of
neighboring APs in residential environments with zero configuration efforts and
without revealing WPA2 encryption keys to untrusted neighbor APs. NxWLAN makes
use of virtualization techniques utilizing neighboring AP by deploying
on-demand a Wireless Termination Point (WTP) on the neighboring AP and by
tunneling encrypted 802.11 traffic to the Virtual Access Point (VAP) residing

the home AP using the WPA2-PSK passphrase already stored in the device without
any additional registration process.

Besides, most of these models do not support back stack that is a particular

the nature of the lens: a planet with mass of $M_{\rm p} = 35^{+17}_{-9}

0.56^{+0.12}_{-0.16} M_{\odot}$ with a planet-host projected separation of

enable joint design of forwarding, caching, and congestion control strategies

this paper, we develop a new class of enhanced algorithms for joint dynamic

enhanced VIP algorithms adaptively stabilize the network and maximize network
utility, while improving the delay performance by intelligently making use of
VIP information beyond one hop. Generalizing Lyapunov drift techniques, we
prove the throughput optimality and characterize the utility-delay tradeoff of
the enhanced VIP algorithms. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior
performance of the resulting enhanced algorithms for handling Interest Packets

measurements from the PARAS (PRL Advanced Radial-velocity Abu-sky Search) high
resolution echelle spectrograph. The periodicity of the single-lined eclipsing
binary (SB1) system, as determined from 20 sets of RV observations from PARAS
and 6 supporting sets of observations from SOPHIE data, is found to be 16.953 d
as against the 4.24 d period reported from SuperWasp photometry. It is likely
that inadequate phase coverage of the transit with SuperWasp photometry led to
the incorrect determination of the period for this system. We derive the
spectral properties of the primary star from the observed stellar spectra: Teff
= 5125 +/- 67 K, [Fe/H] = 0.1 +/- 0.14 and log g = 4.6 +/- 0.14, indicating a
K1V primary. Applying the Torres relation to the derived stellar parameters, we
estimate a primary mass 0.864 +/- 0.097 M_sun and a radius of 0.854 +/- 0.050
R_sun. We combine RV data with SuperWASP photometry to estimate the mass of the
secondary, M_B = 0.098 +/- 0.007 M_sun, and its radius, R_B = 0.127 +/- 0.007
R_sun, with an accuracy of around 7%. Although the observed radius is found to
be consistent with the Baraffe's theoretical models, the uncertainties on the
mass and radius of the secondary reported here are model dependent and should
be used with discretion. Here, we establish this system as a potential
benchmark for the study of VLMS objects, worthy of both photometric follow-up
and the investment of time on high-resolution spectrographs paired with
large-aperture telescopes.

generally considered. The domain is assumed to be bounded, and mixed boundary
conditions are considered. Our approach is based on a nonlinear parabolic
regularization technique, involving the $p$-Laplace operator. First we prove
the existence of a local-in-time solution for the regularized system, by a
fixed point technique. Next, using an energy estimate, we show that if the data
are small enough, bounded by $\varepsilon >0$, then the maximal time of
existence does not depend on the parabolic regularization parameter, and the
behavior of the lifespan $T$ is $\gtrsim \log (1/\varepsilon)$, defining what
we call here {\it almost global existence}. The solution is thus obtained by
passing this parameter to zero. The key point of our proof is due to recent

an object from a single gray level image. In this paper we present a new method
to solve the problem of SFS using Machine learning method. Our approach belongs
to Local resolution category. The orientation of each part of the object is
represented by the perpendicular vector to the surface (Normal Vector), this
vector is defined by two angles SLANT and TILT, such as the TILT is the angle
between the normal vector and Z-axis, and the SLANT is the angle between the
the X-axis and the projection of the normal to the plane. The TILT can be
determined from the gray level, the unknown is the SLANT. To calculate the
normal of each part of the surface (pixel) a supervised Machine learning method
has been proposed. This method divided into three steps: the first step is the
preparation of the training data from 3D mathematical functions and synthetic
objects. The second step is the creation of database of examples from 3D
objects (off-line process). The third step is the application of test images
(on-line process). The idea is to find for each pixel of the test image the
most similar element in the examples database using a similarity value.

magnetized neutron star. During the 2004--2005 outburst, an anti-correlation
between the centroid energy of its fundamental cyclotron resonance scattering
features (CRSFs) and the X-ray luminosity was observed. The long ($\approx 100$

the opportunity to study during another outburst the unique properties of the
fundamental CRSF and its dependence on the X-ray luminosity. The source was
observed by the INTEGRAL satellite for $\sim 330$ ks. We exploit the spectral
resolution at high energies of the SPectrometer on INTEGRAL (SPI) and the Joint
European X-ray Monitors to characterize its spectral properties, focusing in
particular on the CRSF-luminosity dependence. We complement the data of the
2015 outburst with those collected by SPI in 2004--2005 and left unpublished so
far. We find a highly significant anti-correlation of the centroid energy of
the fundamental CRSF and the $3-100$ keV luminosity of $E_1 \propto
-0.095(8)L_{37}$ keV. This trend is observed for both outbursts. We confirm the
correlation between the width of the fundamental CRSF and the X-ray luminosity
previously found in the JEM-X and IBIS dataset of the 2004--2005 outburst. By
exploiting the RXTE/ASM and Swift/BAT monitoring data we also report on the
detection of a $\sim 34$ d modulation superimposed on the mean profiles and
roughly consistent with the orbital period of the pulsar. We discuss possible

data, and the use of those dependencies to perform predictions. During the last
decade, machine learning has made spectacular progress, surpassing human
performance in complex tasks such as object recognition, car driving, and
computer gaming. However, the central role of prediction in machine learning
avoids progress towards general-purpose artificial intelligence. As one way
forward, we argue that causal inference is a fundamental component of human
intelligence, yet ignored by learning algorithms.
  Causal inference is the problem of uncovering the cause-effect relationships
between the variables of a data generating system. Causal structures provide
understanding about how these systems behave under changing, unseen
environments. In turn, knowledge about these causal dynamics allows to answer
""what if"" questions, describing the potential responses of the system under
hypothetical manipulations and interventions. Thus, understanding cause and
effect is one step from machine learning towards machine reasoning and machine
intelligence. But, currently available causal inference algorithms operate in
specific regimes, and rely on assumptions that are difficult to verify in
practice.
  This thesis advances the art of causal inference in three different ways.
First, we develop a framework for the study of statistical dependence based on
copulas and random features. Second, we build on this framework to interpret
the problem of causal inference as the task of distribution classification,
yielding a family of novel causal inference algorithms. Third, we discover
causal structures in convolutional neural network features using our
algorithms. The algorithms presented in this thesis are scalable, exhibit
strong theoretical guarantees, and achieve state-of-the-art performance in a
variety of real-world benchmarks.

processes: generation of active stress in the tissue, and actively driven
topological rearrangements. We find that these two active processes can produce
distinct cellular and tissue shape changes, depending on boundary conditions
applied on the tissue. Our findings have consequences for the understanding of
tissue morphogenesis during development.

  Summer School",,,,"cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reaching some form of consensus is often necessary for autonomous agents that
want to coordinate their actions or otherwise engage in joint activities. One
way to reach a consensus is by aggregating individual information, such as
decisions, beliefs, preferences and constraints. Judgment aggregation is a
social choice method, which generalises voting, that studies the aggregation of
individual judgments regarding the truth-value of logically related
propositions. As such, judgment aggregation is applicable for consensus
reaching problems in multi agent systems. As other social choice theory,
judgment aggregation research is abundant with impossibility results. However,
the aim of this tutorial is to give an introduction to the methods of judgment
aggregation, not the impossibility results. In particular, the tutorial will
introduce the basic frameworks that model judgment aggregation problems and
give an overview of the judgment aggregation functions so far developed as well
as their social theoretic and computational complexity properties. The focus of
the tutorial are consensus reaching problems in multi agent systems that can be
modelled as judgment aggregation problems. The desirable properties of a
judgment aggregation method applied to these problems are not necessarily the
same as properties desirable in legal or political contexts, which is
considered to be the native domain of judgment aggregation. After this tutorial
the participants are expected to be able to read and understand judgment
aggregation literature and have a grasp on the state-of-the-art and open
questions in judgment aggregation research of interest to multi agent systems.

stage of development including strong upstream beam and disturbed magnetic
profile with increased magnetic field at one or two sides as observed by 4
Cluster spacecraft. The angle between the magnetic field vectors at two sides
of the current sheet was ~ 10{\deg}. The minimum magnetic field magnitude
within HFA was ~ 1 nT. The shock at two sides of the HFA was
quasi-perpendicular. Upstream beam was observed on the leading side of the HFA.
Parameters and velocity distributions of solar wind ions and of upstream ions
observed on C1 and C3 spacecraft are analyzed separately in order to trace
their changes across the event. The goal of this analysis was to get more
information about the source of upstream beam. The beam evolved from the start
of its observation till the HFA encounter being initially energetic and nearly
mono-energetic. Its mean energy continuously decreased and energy spectrum
widened as HFA approached spacecraft. First observation of particular energy
that diminished with approaching the HFA varied linearly with gyro-radius of
ions. The energy spectra of integrated beam (for all observation) and the
energy spectrum of the beam observed just in front of HFA are very similar to
the magnetosheath ion energy spectrum observed after bow shock crossing at ~ 1
hour after observation of the HFA. Lowest energies in the beam were observed
within HFA only. Highest density and pressure of upstream beam are found in the
current sheet itself. We suggest that the upstream beam is the result of the
magnetosheath ions leakage through the region of HFA crossing with the bow
shock front.

Previously good solutions
must be updated or replaced due to changes in objectives and constraints. It is

for how populations in dynamic optimisation can be essential are sparse and

  This paper provides theoretical explanations of how populations can be

velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{c}$), stellar, halo, bulge and disk mass, local
density, bulge-to-total ratio, group-centric distance and galaxy-halo mass
ratio. We develop and apply a new statistical technique to quantify the impact
on the quenched fraction ($f_{\rm Quench}$) of varying one parameter, while
keeping the remaining parameters fixed. For centrals, we find that the $f_{\rm

the Munich semi-analytic model (L-Galaxies), finding that our results for
centrals are qualitatively consistent with their predictions for quenching via
radio-mode AGN feedback, hinting at the viability of this process in explaining
our observational trends. However, we also find evidence that quenching in
L-Galaxies is too efficient and quenching in Illustris is not efficient enough,
compared to observations. For satellites, we find strong evidence that
environment affects their quenched fraction at fixed central velocity
dispersion, particularly at lower masses. At higher masses, satellites behave
identically to centrals in their quenching. Of the environmental parameters
considered, local density affects the quenched fraction of satellites the most

facilitate a unique form of mediated communication: dyadic mobile text messages

dating has paved the way for analysis of these digital interactions via massive
sets of data generated by the instant matching and messaging functions of its
many platforms at an unprecedented scale. This paper looks at one of these sets

million messages, exchanged between 400,000 heterosexual users on an MDA.
Through computational analysis methods, this study offers the very first large

differences in how heterosexual male and female users communicate with each

separation, and factors leading to ""success""-operationalized by the exchange of

conversations initiated by men are more likely to be reciprocated. We also
report that the length of conversations, the waiting times, and the length of
messages have fat-tailed distributions. That said, the majority of reciprocated

argument which unifies these velocity domains and the velocity averaging

cone multiplier operator acting on $L^2$. We develop our ideas further in
several ways, including estimates for initial data lying in certain Besov

reduces to the product of two Einstein spaces, each of the special type

can guide the training of CNN towards detecting salient object more effectively

network (C-RAN) in terms of the secrecy and energy efficiency (EE). In this
network, both remote radio heads (RRHs) and massive MIMO macrocell base
stations (BSs) are deployed and soft fractional frequency reuse (S-FFR) is
adopted to mitigate the inter-tier interference. We first examine the physical
layer security by deriving the area ergodic secrecy rate and secrecy outage
probability. Our results reveal that the use of massive MIMO and C-RAN can
greatly improve the secrecy performance. For C-RAN, a large number of RRHs
achieves high area ergodic secrecy rate and low secrecy outage probability, due
to its powerful interference management. We find that for massive MIMO aided
macrocells, having more antennas and serving more users improves secrecy
performance. Then we derive the EE of the heterogeneous C-RAN, illustrating

Markov chains (DTMC) to account for different access strategies and possible
sources of inter-cell and intra-cell interferences. To this end, the developed

resulting in inter- carrier interference (ICI), which may greatly reduce the
service quantity of high-speed railway (HSR) wireless communications. This
paper focuses on ICI mitigation in the HSR downlinks with distributed transmit
antennas.For such a system, its key feature is that the ICIs are caused by
multiple carrier frequency offsets corresponding to multiple transmit antennas.
Meanwhile, the channel of HSR is fast time varying, which is another big
challenge in the system design. In order to get a good performance, low
complexity real-time ICI reduction is necessary. To this end, we first analyzed
the property of the ICI matrix in AWGN and Rician scenarios, respectively.
Then, we propose corresponding low complexity ICI reduction methods based on
location information. For evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed method,
the expectation and variance of remaining interference after ICI reduction is
analyzed with respect to Rician K-factor. In addition, the service quantity and
the bandwidth and computation cost are also discussed. Numerical results are
presented to verify our theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of proposed
ICI reduction methods. One important observation is that our proposed ICI
mitigation method can achieve almost the same service quantity with that
obtained on the case without ICI at 300km/h,that is, ICI has been completely
eliminated. Numerical results also show that the scenarios with Rician
K-factors over 30dB can be considered as AWGN scenarios, which may provide
valuable insights on future system designs.

Graded Strategy Logic (GradedSL), an extension of SL by graded quantifiers over
tuples of strategy variables, i.e., ""there exist at least g different tuples

When the g's are restricted to finite cardinals, written GradedNSL, the
complexity of model-checking is no harder than for SL, i.e., it is
non-elementary in the quantifier rank. We illustrate our formalism by showing
how to count the number of different strategy profiles that are Nash equilibria
(NE), or subgame-perfect equilibria (SPE). By analyzing the structure of the
specific formulas involved, we conclude that the important problems of checking
for the existence of a unique NE or SPE can both be solved in 2ExpTime, which

standard ATL-type concurrent epistemic game structures. We introduce rule-based

task is appealing, but there are several limitations to this approach:
time-inefficient data capture procedures, limited generalization of the data to
other grasps and objects, and inability to use that data to learn more about
how humans perform and evaluate grasps. This paper presents a data capture
protocol that partially addresses these deficiencies by asking participants to
specify ranges over which a grasp is valid. The protocol is verified both
qualitatively through online survey questions (where 95.38% of within-range
grasps are identified correctly with the nearest extreme grasp) and
quantitatively by showing that there is small variation in grasps ranges from
different participants as measured by joint angles, contact points, and
position. We demonstrate that these grasp ranges are valid through testing on a
physical robot (93.75% of grasps interpolated from grasp ranges are
successful).

EDELWEISS-III experiment. A 2D profile likelihood analysis is performed on data
from eight selected detectors with the lowest energy thresholds leading to a
combined fiducial exposure of 496 kg-days. External backgrounds from $\gamma$-
and $\beta$-radiation, recoils from $^{206}$Pb and neutrons as well as detector
intrinsic backgrounds were modelled from data outside the region of interest
and constrained in the analysis. The basic data selection and most of the
background models are the same as those used in a previously published analysis
based on Boosted Decision Trees (BDT). For the likelihood approach applied in
the analysis presented here, a larger signal efficiency and a subtraction of
the expected background lead to a higher sensitivity, especially for the lowest
WIMP masses probed. No statistically significant signal was found and upper
limits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section can be set
with a hypothesis test based on the profile likelihood test statistics. The 90%
C.L. exclusion limit set for WIMPs with $m_\chi = 4\,\mathrm{GeV/}c^2$ is $1.6

with respect to the BDT-based analysis. For WIMP masses above
$15\,\mathrm{GeV/}c^2$ the exclusion limits found with both analyses are in
good agreement.

higher than the values of redshift space distortion (RSD) measurements, if the
cosmological parameters are fixed by the CMB data. In this paper we point out
that this discrepancy can be resolved/understood if we assume that the graviton
has a small but non-zero mass. In the context of the Minimal Theory of Massive
Gravity (MTMG), due to infrared Lorentz violations measurable only at present
cosmological scales, the graviton acquires a mass without being haunted by
unwanted extra degrees of freedom. While the so-called self-accelerating branch
of cosmological solutions in MTMG has the same phenomenology for the background
as well as the scalar- and vector-type linear perturbations as the
$\Lambda$-CDM in General Relativity (GR), it is possible to choose another
branch so that the background is the same as that in GR but the evolution of
matter perturbations gets modified by the graviton mass. On studying the fit of
such modified dynamics to the above-mentioned RSD measurements, we find that
the $\Lambda$-CDM model is less probable than MTMG by two orders of magnitude.
With the help of the cross correlation between the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)
effect and the large scale structure (LSS), the data also pin-down the graviton
mass squared around $\mu^2\approx - (3\times 10^{-33} \rm{eV})^2$, which is
consistent with the latest bound $|\mu^2|<(1.2\times 10^{-22} \rm{eV})^2$ set

upper region in diffusive equilibrium (DE). The latter condition, DE, currently
used in empirical composition models, does not represent a truly static
composition profile in the presence of finite thermal diffusion. Rather,
species by species hydrostatic balance is a consistent (i.e., stationary)

materials remained elusive, firstly because the edges yield a non-extensive
contribution to the thermodynamic potential, and secondly because topological
field theories involve non-local order parameters, and cannot be captured by
the Ginzburg-Landau formalism. Recently, this challenge has been overcome: by
using Hill thermodynamics to describe the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model in two
dimensions, it was shown that at the topological phase change the thermodynamic
potential does not scale extensively due to boundary effects. Here, we extend
this approach to different topological models in various dimensions (the Kitaev
chain and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in one dimension, the Kane-Mele model in
two dimensions and the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model in three dimensions) at zero
temperature. Surprisingly, all models exhibit the same universal behavior in
the order of the topological-phase transition, depending on the dimension.
Moreover, we derive the topological phase diagram at finite temperature using
this thermodynamic description, and show that it displays a good agreement with
the one calculated from the Uhlmann phase. Our work reveals unexpected
universalities and opens the path to a thermodynamic description of systems
with a non-local order parameter.

ever increasing capacity demand. Deploying more base stations (BSs) improves
the spatial frequency utilization, which increases the network capacity.
However, such improvement comes at the expense of shrinking the BSs'
footprints, which increases the handover (HO) rate and may diminish the
foreseen capacity gains. In this paper, we propose a cooperative HO management
scheme to mitigate the HO effect on throughput gains achieved via cellular
network densification. The proposed HO scheme relies on skipping HO to the
nearest BS at some instances along the user's trajectory while enabling
cooperative BS service during HO execution at other instances. To this end, we
develop a mathematical model, via stochastic geometry, to quantify the
performance of the proposed HO scheme in terms of coverage probability and user
throughput. The results show that the proposed cooperative HO scheme
outperforms the always best connected based association at high mobility. Also,
the value of BS cooperation along with handover skipping is quantified with
respect to the HO skipping only that has recently appeared in the literature.
Particularly, the proposed cooperative HO scheme shows throughput gains of 12%
to 27% and 17% on average, when compared to the always best connected and HO
skipping only schemes at user velocity ranging from 80 km/h to 160 Km/h,
respectively.

consider a number of scenarios for the nature of the gas probed by the
sightline absorbers: a co-rotating gas halo associated with a single galaxy
within the group; outflowing material from a single group member powered by
recent star-formation; and cool dense gas associated with an intra-group

two completely confirmed objects that can travel along null geodesics in our
four-dimensional space-time. However, if there exist extra dimensions and only
GWs can propagate freely in the bulk, the causal propagations of GWs and
electromagnetic waves (EMWs) are in general different. In this paper, we study
null geodesics of GWs and EMWs in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space-time
in the presence of the curvature of the universe. We show that for general
cases the horizon radius of GW is longer than EMW within equal time. Taking the

stoquastic Hamiltonians, whose ground states are expressible using only real
nonnegative amplitudes. This raises a question as to whether classical Monte
Carlo methods can simulate stoquastic adiabatic algorithms with polynomial
overhead. Here, we analyze diffusion Monte Carlo algorithms. We argue that,
based on differences between L1 and L2 normalized states, these algorithms
suffer from certain obstructions preventing them from efficiently simulating
stoquastic adiabatic evolution in generality. In practice however, we obtain
good performance by introducing a method that we call Substochastic Monte
Carlo. In fact, our simulations are good classical optimization algorithms in
their own right, competitive with the best previously known heuristic solvers
for MAX-k-SAT at k=2,3,4.

parameter(s) in a model. The estimation usually obtained by maximizing a
log-likelihood which involves log determinant terms. In principle, one requires
the \emph{observed information}--the negative Hessian matrix or the second
derivative of the log-likelihood---to obtain an accurate maximum likelihood
estimator according to the Newton method. When one uses the \emph{Fisher
information}, the expect value of the observed information, a simpler algorithm
than the Newton method is obtained as the Fisher scoring algorithm. With the
advance in high-throughput technologies in the biological sciences,
recommendation systems and social networks, the sizes of data sets---and the
corresponding statistical models---have suddenly increased by several orders of
magnitude. Neither the observed information nor the Fisher information is easy
to obtained for these big data sets. This paper introduces an information
splitting technique to simplify the computation. After splitting the mean of
the observed information and the Fisher information, an simpler approximate
Hessian matrix for the log-likelihood can be obtained. This approximated
Hessian matrix can significantly reduce computations, and makes the linear
mixed model applicable for big data sets. Such a spitting and simpler formulas
heavily depends on matrix algebra transforms, and applicable to large scale

active resistive switching. Interesting complementary effects such as decreased

on reversing the applied bias. The results provide an insight into the use of

functional networks were reliably found at the group level in all sites, and
that the amplitude of the inter-site effects was small to moderate, with a
Cohen's effect size below 0.5 on average across brain connections. We then
implemented a series of Monte-Carlo simulations, based on real data, to
evaluate the impact of the multisite effects on detection power in statistical
tests comparing two groups (with and without the effect) using a general linear
model, as well as on the prediction of group labels with a support-vector

annotators are subject to a common preference or utility function which
generates their comparison behaviors in experiments. However, in reality
annotators are subject to variations due to multi-criteria, abnormal, or a
mixture of such behaviors. In this paper, we propose a parsimonious
mixed-effects model based on HodgeRank, which takes into account both the fixed
effect that the majority of annotators follows a common linear utility model,
and the random effect that a small subset of annotators might deviate from the
common significantly and exhibits strongly personalized preferences. HodgeRank
has been successfully applied to subjective quality evaluation of multimedia
and resolves pairwise crowdsourced ranking data into a global consensus ranking
and cyclic conflicts of interests. As an extension, our proposed methodology
further explores the conflicts of interests through the random effect in
annotator specific variations. The key algorithm in this paper establishes a
dynamic path from the common utility to individual variations, with different
levels of parsimony or sparsity on personalization, based on newly developed
Linearized Bregman Algorithms with Inverse Scale Space method. Finally the
validity of the methodology are supported by experiments with both simulated
examples and three real-world crowdsourcing datasets, which shows that our
proposed method exhibits better performance (i.e. smaller test error) compared
with HodgeRank due to its parsimonious property.

Landau level mixing and disorder effects are neglected, increasing the strength
$W_{0}$ of the potential induces a transition, at a critical strength
$W_{0}^{\left( c\right) },$ from a uniform and fully spin polarized state to a
two-dimensional charge density wave (CDW) with a meronlike spin texture at each
maximum and minimum of the CDW. The collective excitations of this vortex-CDW
are similar to those of the Skyrme crystal that is expected to be the ground
state near filling factor $\nu =1$. In particular, a broken U(1) symmetry in
the vortex-CDW results in an extra gapless phase mode that could provide a fast
channel for the relaxation of nuclear spins. The average spin polarization $%
S_{z}$ changes in a continuous or discontinuous manner as $W_{0}$ is increased

  for evaluation and design of usable authentication solutions",,,"10.14722/eurousec.2016.23007",,"cs.HC cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the past 15 years, researchers have identified an increasing number of
security mechanisms that are so unusable that the intended users either
circumvent them or give up on a service rather than suffer the security. With
hindsight, the reasons can be identified easily enough: either the security
task itself is too cumbersome and/or time-consuming, or it creates high
friction with the users` primary task. The aim of the research presented here
is to equip designers who select and implement security mechanisms with a
method for identifying the ``best fit`` security mechanism at the design stage.
Since many usability problems have been identified with authentication, we
focus on ``best fit`` authentication, and present a framework that allows
security designers not only to model the workload associated with a particular
authentication method, but more importantly to model it in the context of the
user`s primary task. We draw on results from cognitive psychology to create a
method that allows a designer to understand the impact of a particular
authentication method on user productivity and satisfaction. In a validation
study using a physical mockup of an airline check-in kiosk, we demonstrate that
the model can predict user performance and satisfaction. Furthermore, design
experts suggested personalized order recommendations which were similar to our
model`s predictions. Our model is the first that supports identification of a
holistic fit between the task of user authentication and the context in which
it is performed. When applied to new systems, we believe it will help designers
understand the usability impact of their security choices and thus develop
solutions that maximize both.

following: i) in standard quantum mechanics, there is no known mechanism in our
system that prohibits its use in future differential measurement applications;
ii) our experiment tests quantum mechanics in that it constrains any
modifications that would reduce contrast in an interferometer with arms that
propagate over widely separated trajectories; and iii) using a standard
definition of superposition, our observation of interference results from
quantum superposition at the half-metre scale. In particular, quantum
superposition is a more general concept than first-order coherence.

  This article describes an algorithm for producing, for any desired resolution
and any desired numbers of wheel and pinion teeth, polygonal approximations to
the shapes of a pair of cycloidal gears that mesh correctly. An Octave
implementation of the algorithm, mostly written in 2014, is included. The
Octave implementation contains a (crude, but evidently adequate, at least for
reasonable numbers of wheel and pinion teeth) solution of the problem of
iteratively finding the generating wheel angle corresponding to the tips of the
tooth addenda.
  However, this Octave implementation does not contain a good solution to the
problem of automatically determining the generating wheel angles required to
produce a polygon which approximates the curved addenda to a resolution
specified by the user. A proposed better solution to this problem, involving a
priority queue, is discussed.

of ramping resources and their increasing importance motivated by the
variability of power resources, particularly due to the addition of solar
power, which exacerbates the need of fast ramping units in the early morning

be found through Euler-Lagrange equations and we argue that this price signal
better reflects the market value of power in the presence of significant ramps
in net-load.

targets such as drugs, proteins and pathogens with high sensitivity and
selectivity. Therefore, aptamers are largely employed for producing label-free
biosensors, with significant applications in diagnostics and drug delivery. In
particular, the anti-thrombin aptamers are biomolecules of high interest for
clinical use, because of their ability to recognize and bind the thrombin
enzyme. Among them, the DNA 15-mer thrombin-binding aptamer (TBA), has been
widely explored concerning both its structure, which was resolved with
different techniques, and its function, especially about the possibility of
using it as the active part of biosensors. This paper proposes a microscopic
model of the electrical properties of TBA and the aptamer-thrombin complex,
combining information from both structure and function. The novelty consists in
describing both the aptamer alone and the complex as an impedance network, thus
going deeper inside the issues addressed in an emerging electronics branch
known as proteotronics. The theoretical results are compared and validated with
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy measurements reported in the literature.
Finally, the model suggests resistance measurements as a novel tool for testing
aptamer-target affinity.

model of rate-independent strain-gradient plasticity and its regularization. It
is shown that the flow relation, when expressed in terms of the Cauchy stress,
is necessarily global. The most convenient approach to formulating the flow
relation is through the use of a dissipation function. It is shown, however,
that the task of obtaining the dual version, in the form of a normality
relation, is a complex one. A numerical investigation casts further light on
the response using the dissipative theory in situations of non-proportional
loading. The elastic gap, a feature reported in recent investigations, is
observed in situations in which passivation has been imposed. It is shown
computationally that the gap may be regarded as an efficient path between a
load-deformation response corresponding to micro-free boundary conditions, and
that corresponding to micro-hard boundary conditions, in which plastic strains
are set equal to zero.
