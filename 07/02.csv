using a coordinated observation of a near disk-center sunspot with IRIS and the
1.6 m New Solar Telescope (NST) at the Big Bear Solar Observatory. NST provides
high-resolution chromospheric and photospheric observations with narrow-band
H-alpha imaging spectroscopy and broad-band TiO images, respectively,
complementary to IRIS TR observations. A total of 2692 TR penumbral BDs are
identified from a 37-minute time series of IRIS 1400 A slitjaw images. Their
locations tend to be associated more with downflowing and darker fibrils in the
chromosphere, and weakly associated with bright penumbral features in the
photosphere. However, temporal evolution analyses of the BDs show that there is
no consistent and convincing brightening response in the chromosphere. These
results are compatible with a formation mechanism of the TR penumbral BDs by
falling plasma from coronal heights along more vertical and dense magnetic
loops. The BDs may also be produced by small-scale impulsive magnetic
reconnection taking place sufficiently high in the atmosphere that has no
energy release in the chromosphere.

method based on a weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) methodology is
developed for one-dimensional linear transport equations and further applied to
the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) simulations via dimensional splitting. In the MOL$^T$
framework, the time variable is first discretized by a diagonally implicit
strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta method, resulting in a boundary value
problem (BVP) at the discrete time levels. Then an integral formulation coupled
with a high order WENO methodology is employed to solve the BVP. As a result,
the proposed scheme is high order accurate in both space and time and free of
oscillations even though the solution is discontinuous or has sharp gradients.
Moreover, the scheme is able to take larger time step evolution compared with
an explicit MOL WENO scheme with the same order of accuracy. The desired
positivity-preserving (PP) property of the scheme is further attained by
incorporating a newly proposed high order PP limiter. We perform numerical
experiments on several benchmarks including linear advection, solid body
rotation problem; and on the Landau damping, two-stream instabilities,
bump-on-tail, and plasma sheath by solving the VP system. The efficacy and
efficiency of the proposed scheme is numerically verified.

The latter is a non
perturbative object, arising from the combined projection of an S-duality twist
and a discrete orbifold of the R-symmetry group. This construction naively
gives rise to 4d $\mathcal{N}=3$ SCFTs. Nevertheless it has been observed that
in some cases supersymmetry is enhanced to $\mathcal{N}=4$. In this paper we
study the explicit counting of degrees of freedom arising from vector
multiplets associated to strings suspended between the D3 branes probing the
S-fold. We propose that, for trivial discrete torsion, there is no vector
multiplet associated to $(1,0)$ strings stretched between a brane and its
image. We then focus on the case of rank 2 $\mathcal{N}=3$ theory that enhances
to $SU(3)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, explicitly spelling out the isomorphism between
the BPS-spectrum of the manifestly $\mathcal{N}=3$ theory and that of three D3
branes in flat spacetime. Subsequently, we consider 3-pronged strings in these
setups and show how wall-crossing in the S-fold background implies wall
crossing in the flat geometry. This can be considered a consistency check of
the \emph{conjectured} SUSY enhancement. We also find that the above
isomorphism implies that a $(1,0)$ string, suspended between a brane and its
image in the S-fold, corresponds to a 3-string junction in the flat geometry.
This is in agreement with our claim on the absence of a vector multiplet
associated to such $(1,0)$ strings. This is because the 3-string junction in
flat geometry gives rise to a $1/4$-th BPS multiplet of the $\mathcal{N}=4$
algebra. Such multiplets always include particles with spin $>1$ as opposed to
a vector multiplet which is restricted by the requirement that the spins must
be $\leq 1$.

regularization is utilized to find sparse minimizers of convex functions. A
well-known example is the LASSO problem, where the l1 norm regularizes a
quadratic function. A multilevel framework is presented for solving such l1
regularized sparse optimization problems efficiently. We take advantage of the
expected sparseness of the solution, and create a hierarchy of problems of
similar type, which is traversed in order to accelerate the optimization
process. This framework is applied for solving two problems: (1) the sparse
inverse covariance estimation problem, and (2) l1-regularized logistic
regression. In the first problem, the inverse of an unknown covariance matrix
of a multivariate normal distribution is estimated, under the assumption that
it is sparse. To this end, an l1 regularized log-determinant optimization
problem needs to be solved. This task is challenging especially for large-scale
datasets, due to time and memory limitations. In the second problem, the
l1-regularization is added to the logistic regression classification objective
to reduce overfitting to the data and obtain a sparse model. Numerical
experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the multilevel framework in
accelerating existing iterative solvers for both of these problems.

current interest, exemplifying a form of `active matter'. Examples include
self-propelling bacteria, algae and sperm, and artificial swimmers. Ericksen's
model of a transversely-isotropic fluid [J. L. Ericksen, Colloid Polym. Sci.

continuum with an evolving preferred direction; this model describes fibrous
materials as diverse as extracellular matrix, textile tufts and plant cell
walls. Director-dependent effects are incorporated through a modified stress
tensor with four viscosity-like parameters. By making fundamental connections
with recent models for active suspensions, we propose a modification to
Ericksen's model, mainly the inclusion of self motility; this can be considered
the simplest description of an oriented suspension including
transversely-isotropic effects. Motivated by the fact that
transversely-isotropic fluids exhibit modified flow stability, we conduct a
linear stability analysis of two distinct cases, aligned and isotropic
suspensions of elongated active particles. Novel aspects include the
anisotropic rheology and translational diffusion. In general anisotropic
effects increase the instability of small perturbations, whilst translational
diffusion stabilises a range of wave-directions and, in some cases, a finite
range of wave-numbers, thus emphasising that both anisotropy and translational
diffusion can have important effects in these systems.

7 to 11 orders of magnitude faster than that along the other directions,
indicating its ultrafast and anisotropic diffusivity. The lithium insertion in
phosphorene was studied considering various LinP16 configurations (n=1~16). It
was found that phosphorene could accommodate up to one Li per P atom (i.e.,
Li16P16), and the predicted theoretical value of the Li capacity for a single
layered phosphorene can reach about 865 mAh/g. Our experimental measurement on
the Li capacity for a network of a few layered phosphorene can reach a

evolution tuning the amount and frequency of learning experienced by an

varying landscape ruggedness varies the benefit of the haploid-diploid cycle,
whether based upon endomitosis or syngamy. The utility of pre-meiotic doubling
and recombination during the cycle are also shown to vary with landscape

HATS-19 is a slightly evolved V = 13.0 G0 star with [Fe/H] = 0.240, a mass of
1.303 Msun, and a radius of 1.75 Rsun. HATS-19b is in an eccentric orbit (e =
0.30) around this star with an orbital period of 4.5697 days and has a mass of
0.427 Mjup and a highly inflated radius of 1.66 Rjup. The planet HATS-20b has a
Saturn-like mass and radius of 0.273 Mjup and 0.776 Rjup respectively. It
orbits the V = 13.8 G9V star HATS-20 (Ms = 0.910 Msun; Rs = 0.892 Rsun) with a
period of 3.7993 days. Finally, HATS-21 is a V = 12.2 G4V star with [Fe/H] =

planet HATS-21b has a 3.5544-day orbital period, a mass of 0.332 Mjup, and a
moderately inflated radius of 1.123 Rjup. With the addition of these three very
different planets to the growing sample of hot-Saturns, we re-examine the
relations between the observed giant planet radii, stellar irradiation, and
host metallicity. We find a significant positive correlation between planet
equilibrium temperature and radius, and a weak negative correlation between
host metallicity and radius. To assess the relative influence of various
physical parameters on observed planet radii, we train and fit models using
Random Forest regression. We find that for hot-Saturns (0.1 < Mp < 0.5 Mjup),
the planetary mass and equilibrium temperature play dominant roles in
determining radii. For hot-Jupiters (0.5 < Mp < 2.0 Mjup), the most important
parameter is equilibrium temperature alone. Finally, for irradiated higher-mass
planets (Mp > 2.0 Mjup), we find that equilibrium temperature dominates in
influence, with smaller contributions from planet mass and host metallicity.

fragmentation in collapsing cores so as to produce multiple star systems. Even
when the two mechanisms predict different manners in which the stellar spins
and orbits are aligned, subsequent internal or external interactions can drive
multiple systems towards or away from alignment thus masking their formation
process. Here, we demonstrate that the geometrical and dynamical relationship
between the binary system and its surrounding bulk envelope provide the crucial
distinction between fragmentation models. We find that the circumstellar disks
of the binary protostellar system L1551 IRS 5 are closely parallel not just
with each other but also with their surrounding flattened envelope.
Measurements of the relative proper motion of the binary components spanning
nearly 30 yr indicate an orbital motion in the same sense as the envelope
rotation. Eliminating orbital solutions whereby the circumstellar disks would
be tidally truncated to sizes smaller than are observed, the remaining
solutions favor a circular or low-eccentricity orbit tilted by up to
$\sim$25$^\circ$ from the circumstellar disks. Turbulence-driven fragmentation
can generate local angular momentum to produce a coplanar binary system, but
which bears no particular relationship with its surrounding envelope. Instead,
the observed properties conform with predictions for rotationally-driven
fragmentation. If the fragments were produced at different heights or on
opposite sides of the midplane in the flattened central region of a rotating
core, the resulting protostars would then exhibit circumstellar disks parallel
with the surrounding envelope but tilted from the orbital plane as is observed.

application, we calculate the time-dependent mobility function and an effective

and mobility coefficients, for a system of active particles interacting via a
screened-Coulomb potential. We find that this effective temperature decreases
with increasing persistence time of the self-propulsion. Initially, for not too
large persistence times, it changes rather slowly, but then it decreases
markedly when the persistence length of the self-propelled motion becomes

point-to-point communication over fading channels is introduced, whereby the
source must transmit a packet when the user requests it within a deadline of a
single time slot. We introduce a prediction model in which the source predicts
the request arrival $T_p$ slots ahead, where $T_p$ denotes the prediction
window (PW) size. The source allocates energy to transmit some bits proactively
for each time slot of the PW with the objective of reducing the transmission
energy over the non-predictive case. The requests are predicted based on the
user location utilizing the prior statistics about the user requests at each
location. We also assume that the prediction is not perfect. We propose
proactive scheduling policies to minimize the expected energy consumption
required to transmit the requested packets under two different assumptions on
the channel state information at the source. In the first scenario, offline
scheduling, we assume the channel states are known a-priori at the source at
the beginning of the PW. In the second scenario, online scheduling, it is
assumed that the source has causal knowledge of the channel state. Numerical
results are presented showing the gains achieved by using proactive scheduling
policies compared with classical (reactive) networks. Simulation results also
show that increasing the PW size leads to a significant reduction in the
consumed transmission energy even with imperfect prediction.

Depending on the initial state, the energy density can approach its asymptotic

lead to a phase of super-acceleration also in the non-interacting massive case.

Joint Density Functional Theory (JDFT) to simulate the pseudocapacitive
behavior of RuO2, a prototypical material, in a model electrolyte. We obtained
from JDFT a capacitive curve which showed a redox peak position comparable to
that in the experimental cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve. We found that the
experimental turning point from double-layer to pseudocapacitive charge storage
at low scan rates could be explained by the hydrogen adsorption at low
coverage. As the electrode voltage becomes more negative, H coverage increases
and causes the surface structure change, leading to bended OH bonds at the
on-top oxygen atoms and large capacitance. This H coverage-dependent
capacitance can explain the high pseudocapacitance of hydrous RuO2. Our work
here provides a first principles understanding of the pseudocapacitance for
RuO2 in particular and for transition-metal oxides in general.

experimental data with a reasonable convergence of a carefully defined chiral
series, where NNLO remainders are assumed to be small. By treating the
uncertainties in the higher orders statistically, we numerically generate a
large set of theoretical predictions, which are then confronted with
experimental information. In the case of the decay widths, the experimental

thus no tension is observed, in spite of what some of the traditional

C.L. This can be interpreted in two ways - either some of the higher order
corrections are indeed unexpectedly large or there is a specific configuration
of the remainders, which is, however, not completely improbable. Also, the
distribution of the theoretical uncertainties is found to be significantly
non-gaussian, so the consistency cannot be simply judged by the 1$\sigma$ error
bars.

inversion of the usual approach of identifying a global symmetry and then
promoting it to a local one, we focus directly on the gauge symmetries of the
theory. This allows for action functionals which are gauge invariant for rather
general background fields in the sense that their invariance conditions are
milder than the usual case. In particular, the vector fields that control the
gauging need not be Killing. The relaxation of isometry for the background
fields is controlled by two connections on a Lie algebroid L in which the gauge
fields take values, in a generalization of the common Lie-algebraic picture.
Here we show that these connections can always be determined when L is a Dirac
structure in the H-twisted Courant algebroid. This also leads us to a
derivation of the general form for the gauge symmetries of a wide class of
two-dimensional topological field theories called Dirac sigma-models, which
interpolate between the G/G Wess-Zumino-Witten model and the (Wess-Zumino-term
twisted) Poisson sigma model.

sometimes observed in the X-ray light curves of sources viewed at such an

Instead, we propose that HS 2220$+$2146 formed through a new wide DWD
evolutionary channel involving the merger of the inner binary in a hierarchical

independently, forming the WD pair seen today. Although we cannot rule out
other scenarios, the most likely formation channel has the inner binary merging
while both stars are still on the main sequence. This provides us with the
tantalizing possibility that Kozai-Lidov oscillations may have played a role in
the inner binary's merger. {\it Gaia} may uncover hundreds more wide DWDs,
leading to the identification of other systems like HS 2220$+$2146. There are
already indications that other WD systems may have been formed through
different, but related, hierarchical triple evolutionary scenarios.
Characterizing these populations may allow for thorough testing of the
efficiency with which KL oscillations induce stellar mergers.

large-scale sparse linear systems arising from numerical solutions of partial
differential equations (PDEs). These linear systems are often nonsymmetric due
to the nature of the PDEs, boundary or jump conditions, or discretization
methods. While implementations of preconditioned KSP methods are usually
readily available, it is unclear to users which methods are the best for
different classes of problems. In this work, we present a comparison of some
KSP methods, including GMRES, TFQMR, BiCGSTAB, and QMRCGSTAB, coupled with
three classes of preconditioners, namely Gauss-Seidel, incomplete LU
factorization (including ILUT, ILUTP, and multilevel ILU), and algebraic
multigrid (including BoomerAMG and ML). Theoretically, we compare the
mathematical formulations and operation counts of these methods. Empirically,
we compare the convergence and serial performance for a range of benchmark
problems from numerical PDEs in 2D and 3D with up to millions of unknowns and
also assess the asymptotic complexity of the methods as the number of unknowns
increases. Our results show that GMRES tends to deliver better performance when
coupled with an effective multigrid preconditioner, but it is less competitive
with an ineffective preconditioner due to restarts. BoomerAMG with proper
choice of coarsening and interpolation techniques typically converges faster
than ML, but both may fail for ill-conditioned or saddle-point problems while
multilevel ILU tends to succeed. We also show that right preconditioning is
more desirable. This study helps establish some practical guidelines for
choosing preconditioned KSP methods and motivates the development of more
effective preconditioners.

of machine learning algorithms. This paper explores the use of Bregman
divergences to establish reductions between such algorithms and their analyses.
We present a new scaled isodistortion theorem involving Bregman divergences
(scaled Bregman theorem for short) which shows that certain ""Bregman
distortions'"" (employing a potentially non-convex generator) may be exactly
re-written as a scaled Bregman divergence computed over transformed data.
Admissible distortions include geodesic distances on curved manifolds and
projections or gauge-normalisation, while admissible data include scalars,
vectors and matrices.
  Our theorem allows one to leverage to the wealth and convenience of Bregman
divergences when analysing algorithms relying on the aforementioned Bregman
distortions. We illustrate this with three novel applications of our theorem: a
reduction from multi-class density ratio to class-probability estimation, a new
adaptive projection free yet norm-enforcing dual norm mirror descent algorithm,
and a reduction from clustering on flat manifolds to clustering on curved
manifolds. Experiments on each of these domains validate the analyses and
suggest that the scaled Bregman theorem might be a worthy addition to the
popular handful of Bregman divergence properties that have been pervasive in
machine learning.

to pressure, acceleration values were also recorded using the built-in

because this sensor does not receive satellite signals indoors and, in general,
the operating frequency is considerably lower than that of the pressure sensor.

challenging open problem in theoretical physics. Notably, a satisfactory
description of the confinement of gluons is not at our disposal so far. In this
thesis, the RGZ framework, designed to provide a proper quantization of YM
theories by taking into account the existence of the so-called Gribov copies is
explored. Successfully introduced in the Landau gauge, the RGZ set up does not
extend easily to different gauges. The main reason is that a clear formulation
of the analogue of the Gribov horizon in the Landau gauge is obstructed by
technical difficulties when more sophisticated gauges are chosen. Moreover, the
RGZ action breaks BRST symmetry explicitly, making the task of extracting gauge
invariant results even more difficult. The main goal of the present thesis is
precisely to provide a consistent framework to extend the RGZ action to gauges
that are connected to Landau gauge via a gauge parameter. Our main result is
the reformulation of the theory in the Landau gauge with appropriate variables
such that a non-perturbative BRST symmetry is constructed. This symmetry
corresponds to a deformation of the standard BRST symmetry by taking into
account non-perturbative effects. This opens a toolbox which allow us to
explore what would be the Gribov horizon in different gauges as linear
covariant and Curci-Ferrari gauges. Consistency with gauge independence of
physical quantities as well as the computation of the gluon propagator in these
gauges is provided. Remarkably, when lattice or functional methods results are
available, we verify very good agreement with our analytical proposal giving
support that it could provide some insights about the non-perturbative regime
of YM theories. A positivity violating gluon propagator in the infrared seems
to be a general feature of the formalism.

synthesize concrete values of the fixed-delays (timeouts) that minimize the

same problem has been considered and solved in previous works by computing an
optimal policy in a certain discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP) with a
huge number of actions that correspond to suitably discretized values of the
timeouts.
  In this paper, we design a symbolic fixed-delay synthesis algorithm which
avoids the explicit construction of large action spaces. Instead, the algorithm
computes a small sets of ""promising"" candidate actions on demand. The candidate
actions are selected by minimizing a certain objective function by computing
its symbolic derivative and extracting a univariate polynomial whose roots are
precisely the points where the derivative takes zero value. Since roots of high
degree univariate polynomials can be isolated very efficiently using modern
mathematical software, we achieve not only drastic memory savings but also
speedup by three orders of magnitude compared to the previous methods.

during inflation, the negative energy density may locally destabilize the
spacetime. We use numerical simulations of the Einstein equations to study the
evolution of inflation-induced Higgs fluctuations as they grow towards the true
(negative-energy) minimum. These simulations show that forming a single patch
of true vacuum in our past light cone during inflation is incompatible with the
existence of our Universe; the boundary of the true vacuum region grows outward
in a causally disconnected manner from the crunching interior, which forms a
black hole. We also find that these black hole horizons may be arbitrarily
elongated---even forming black strings---in violation of the hoop conjecture.
By extending the numerical solution of the Fokker-Planck equation to the
exponentially suppressed tails of the field distribution at large field values,
we derive a rigorous correlation between a future measurement of the
tensor-to-scalar ratio and the scale at which the Higgs potential must receive
stabilizing corrections in order for the Universe to have survived inflation

a generalised resampling method that can correct systematic and statistical
errors in cosmological parameter constraints caused by uncertainties in the
redshift distribution. This can be achieved without any prior assumptions about
the shape of the distribution or the form of the redshift error. Our
methodology allows photometric surveys to obtain unbiased cosmological
parameter constraints using a minimum number of spectroscopic calibration data.
For a DES-like galaxy clustering forecast we obtain unbiased results with
respect to errors caused by suboptimal histogram bin width selection, using
only 5k representative spectroscopic calibration objects per tomographic
redshift bin.

Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space, we analyze 2200 cluster and 1748 field
galaxies at $0.2\leq z\leq0.7$ to determine the impact of environment on galaxy
size and structure at $\log M_*/M_\odot>7.8$, an unprecedented limit at these
redshifts. Based on simple assumptions-$r_e=f(M_*)$-we find no significant
differences in half-light radii ($r_e$) between equal-mass cluster or field
systems. More complex analyses-$r_e=f(M_*,U-V,n,z,\Sigma$)-reveal local density
$(\Sigma$) to induce only a $7\% \pm 3\%$ ($95\%$ confidence) reduction in
$r_e$ beyond what can be accounted for by $U-V$ color, Sersic index ($n$), and
redshift ($z$) effects.Almost any size difference between galaxies in high- and
low-density regions is thus attributable to their different distributions in
properties other than environment. Indeed, we find a clear color-$r_e$
correlation in low-mass passive cluster galaxies ($\log M_*/M_\odot<9.8$) such
that bluer systems have larger radii, with the bluest having sizes consistent
with equal-mass star-forming galaxies. We take this as evidence that
large-$r_e$ low-mass passive cluster galaxies are recently acquired systems
that have been environmentally quenched without significant structural
transformation (e.g., by ram pressure stripping or starvation).Conversely,
$\sim20\%$ of small-$r_e$ low-mass passive cluster galaxies appear to have been
in place since $z\sim3$. Given the consistency of the small-$r_e$ galaxies'
stellar surface densities (and even colors) with those of systems more than ten
times as massive, our findings suggest that clusters mark places where galaxy
evolution is accelerated for an ancient base population spanning most masses,
with late-time additions quenched by environment-specific mechanisms are mainly
restricted to the lowest masses.

with hotspots in their atmospheres, inner disk warps and other 3-D effects in
the nearby circumstellar environment. Our models are based on the geometry
expected from the magneto-accretion theory, where material moving inward in the
disk flows along magnetic field lines to the star and creates stellar hotspots
upon impact. Due to rotation of the star and magnetosphere, the disk is
variably illuminated. We compare our model light curves to data from the
Spitzer YSOVAR project (Morales-Calderon et al. 2014, Cody et al. 2014) to
determine if these processes can explain the variability observed at optical
and mid-infrared wavelengths in young stars. We focus on those variables
exhibiting ""dipper"" behavior that may be periodic, quasi-periodic, or
aperiodic. We find that the stellar hotspot size and temperature affects the
optical and near-infrared light curves, while the shape and vertical extent of
the inner disk warp affects the mid-IR light curve variations. Clumpy disk
distributions with non-uniform fractal density structure produce more
stochastic light curves. We conclude that the magneto-accretion theory is
consistent with certain aspects of the multi-wavelength photometric variability
exhibited by low-mass YSOs. More detailed modeling of individual sources can be
used to better determine the stellar hotspot and inner disk geometries of
particular sources.

new model for the global 21-cm signal that is explicitly calibrated to
measurements of the galaxy luminosity function (LF) and further tuned to match
the Thomson scattering optical depth of the cosmic microwave background,
$\tau_e$. Assuming that the $z \lesssim 8$ galaxy population can be smoothly
extrapolated to higher redshifts, the recent decline in best-fit values of
$\tau_e$ and the inefficient heating induced by X-ray binaries (HMXBs; the
presumptive sources of the X-ray background at high-$z$) imply that the
entirety of cosmic reionization and reheating occurs at redshifts $z \lesssim
12$. In contrast to past global 21-cm models, whose $z \sim 20$ ($\nu \sim 70$
MHz) absorption features and strong $\sim 25$ mK emission features were driven
largely by the assumption of efficient early star-formation and X-ray heating,
our new fiducial model peaks in absorption at $\nu \sim 110$ MHz at a depth of
$\sim -160$ mK and has a negligible emission component. As a result, a strong
emission signal would provide convincing evidence that HMXBs are not the only
drivers of cosmic reheating. Shallow absorption troughs should accompany strong
heating scenarios, but could also be caused by a low escape fraction of
Lyman-Werner photons. Generating signals with troughs at $\nu \lesssim 95$ MHz
requires a floor in the star-formation efficiency in halos below $\sim 10^{9}
M_{\odot}$, which is equivalent to steepening the faint-end of the galaxy LF.
These findings demonstrate that the global 21-cm signal is a powerful
complement to current and future galaxy surveys and efforts to better
understand the interstellar medium in high-$z$ galaxies.

in the protoplanetary disk around HL Tau. Magnetically aligned grains are
commonly interpreted as the source of polarization. However, self-scattering by
large dust grains with a high enough albedo is another polarization mechanism,
becoming a compelling method independent of the spectral index to constrain the
dust grain size in protoplanetary disks. We study the dust polarization at mm
wavelength in the dust trapping scenario proposed for transition disks, when a
giant planet opens a gap in the disk. We investigate the characteristic
polarization patterns and their dependence on disk inclination, dust size
evolution, planet position, and observing wavelength. We combine
two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disk interactions with
self-consistent dust growth models. These size-dependent dust density
distributions are used for follow-up three-dimensional radiative transfer
calculations to predict the polarization degree at ALMA bands due to scattered
thermal emission. We find that the polarization pattern of a disk with a
planetary gap after 1 Myr of dust evolution shows a distinctive three ring
structure. Two narrow inner rings are located at the planet gap edges. For
increasing observing wavelengths all three rings slightly change their
position, where the innermost and outermost rings move inward. This distance is
detectable comparing the results at ALMA bands 3, 6 and 7. Within the highest
polarized intensity regions the polarization vectors are oriented in the
azimuthal direction. For an inclined disk there is an interplay between
polarization originating from a flux gradient and inclination-induced
quadrupole polarization. For intermediate inclined transition disks the
polarization degree is as high as ~ 2% at band 3, which is well above the
detection limit of future ALMA observations.

certain non-local observables obey ETH.

identify the key reactions responsible for producing a specific molecule, we
revisit the quenching approximation and find that it is accurate for methane

acetylene is not directly determined by transport-induced quenching, but is
rather indirectly controlled by the disequilibrium abundance of methane.
Therefore, we suggest that the quenching approximation should be used with

on this distribution. Due to the domain geometry and the proposed response
model, the negative logarithm of the likelihood is only piecewise continuous
differentiable, and it has multiple local minima. To address these
difficulties, we investigate three hybrid algorithms comprised of mixed
optimization techniques. For global optimization, we consider Simulated
Annealing (SA), Particle Swarm (PS) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), which rely
solely on objective function evaluations; i.e., they do not evaluate the
gradient in the objective function. By employing early stopping criteria for
the global optimization methods, a pseudo-optimum point is obtained. This is
subsequently utilized as the initial value by the deterministic Implicit
Filtering method (IF), which is able to find local extrema in non-smooth
functions, to finish the search in a narrow domain. These new hybrid techniques
combining global optimization and Implicit Filtering address difficulties
associated with the non-smooth response, and their performances are shown to
significantly decrease the computational time over the global optimization
methods alone. To quantify uncertainties associated with the source location
and intensity, we employ the Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis (DRAM) and
DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithms. Marginal

learning a static model on tediously labeled training data. Though labeling
manually is an indispensable part of a supervised framework, for a large scale
identification system labeling huge amount of data is a significant overhead.
For large multi-sensor data as typically encountered in camera networks,
labeling a lot of samples does not always mean more information, as redundant
images are labeled several times. In this work, we propose a convex
optimization based iterative framework that progressively and judiciously
chooses a sparse but informative set of samples for labeling, with minimal
overlap with previously labeled images. We also use a structure preserving
sparse reconstruction based classifier to reduce the training burden typically
seen in discriminative classifiers. The two stage approach leads to a novel
framework for online update of the classifiers involving only the incorporation
of new labeled data rather than any expensive training phase. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach on multi-camera person re-identification

investigate international migration. These efforts show that Web data are
valuable for estimating migration rates and are relatively easy to obtain.
However, existing studies have only investigated flows of people along
migration corridors, i.e. between pairs of countries. In our work, we use data
about ""places lived"" from millions of Google+ users in order to study migration
""clusters"", i.e. groups of countries in which individuals have lived. For the
first time, we consider information about more than two countries people have
lived in. We argue that these data are very valuable because this type of
information is not available in traditional demographic sources which record
country-to-country migration flows independent of each other. We show that
migration clusters of country triads cannot be identified using information
about bilateral flows alone. To demonstrate the additional insights that can be
gained by using data about migration clusters, we first develop a model that
tries to predict the prevalence of a given triad using only data about its
constituent pairs. We then inspect the groups of three countries which are more
or less prominent, compared to what we would expect based on bilateral flows
alone. Next, we identify a set of features such as a shared language or
colonial ties that explain which triple of country pairs are more or less
likely to be clustered when looking at country triples. Then we select and
contrast a few cases of clusters that provide some qualitative information
about what our data set shows. The type of data that we use is potentially
available for a number of social media services. We hope that this first study
about migration clusters will stimulate the use of Web data for the development

chemical bond structures in molecules. Recently, a nucleon localization based
on Hartree-Fock densities has been introduced to investigate $\alpha$-cluster
structures in light nuclei. Compared to the local nucleonic densities, the
nucleon localization function has been shown to be an excellent indicator of
shell effects and cluster correlations. Using the spatial nucleon localization
measure, we investigate the emergence of fragments in fissioning heavy nuclei.
To illustrate basic concepts of nucleon localization, we employ the
self-consistent energy density functional method with a quantified energy
density functional optimized for fission studies. We study the particle
densities and spatial nucleon localization distributions along the fission
pathways of $^{264}$Fm, $^{232}$Th and $^{240}$Pu. We demonstrate that the
fission fragments are formed fairly early in the evolution, well before
scission. We illustrate the usefulness of the localization measure by showing
how the hyperdeformed state of $^{232}$Th can be understood in terms of a
quasimolecular state made of $^{132}$Sn and $^{100}$Zr fragments. Compared to
nucleonic distributions, the nucleon localization function more effectively
quantifies nucleonic clustering: its characteristic oscillating pattern, traced
back to shell effects, is a clear fingerprint of cluster/fragment
configurations. This is of particular interest for studies of fragment
formation and fragment identification in fissioning nuclei.

obtained infrared spectra of IRAS 19312+1950 in the range 5-550 $\mu$m using
the Herschel and Spitzer space observatories. The Herschel PACS maps exhibit a
compact, slightly asymmetric continuum source at 170 $\mu$m, indicative of a
large, dusty circumstellar envelope. The far-IR CO emission line spectrum
reveals two gas temperature components: $\approx0.22M_{\odot}$ of material at
$280\pm18$ K, and $\approx1.6M_{\odot}$ of material at $157\pm3$ K. The OI 63
$\mu$m line is detected on-source but no significant emission from atomic ions
was found. The HIFI observations display shocked, high-velocity gas with
outflow speeds up to 90 km s$^{-1}$ along the line of sight. From Spitzer
spectroscopy, we identify ice absorption bands due to H$_2$O at 5.8 $\mu$m and
CO$_2$ at 15 $\mu$m. The spectral energy distribution is consistent with a
massive, luminous ($\sim2\times10^4L_{\odot}$) central source surrounded by a
dense, warm circumstellar disk and envelope of total mass
$\sim500$-$700M_{\odot}$, with large bipolar outflow cavities. The combination
of distinctive far-IR spectral features suggest that IRAS 19312+1950 should be
classified as an accreting high-mass YSO rather than an evolved star. In light
of this reclassification, IRAS 19312+1950 becomes only the 5th high-mass
protostar known to exhibit SiO maser activity, and demonstrates that 18 cm OH
maser line ratios may not be reliable observational discriminators between
evolved stars and YSOs.

estuaries of Ecuador contain approximately 7,742,999 t (plus or minus 15.47
percent) of standing carbon. Of particular high carbon holdings are the
Rhizophora mangle dominated mangrove stands found in-and-around the
Cayapas-Mataje Ecological Reserve in northern Esmeraldas Province, Ecuador and
certain stands of Rhizophora mangle in-and-around the Isla Corazon y Fragata
Wildlife Refuge in central Manabi Province, Ecuador. Our field driven mangrove
carbon estimate is higher than all but one of the comparison models evaluated.
We find that basic latitudinal mangrove carbon models performed at least as
well, if not better, than the more complex species based allometric models in
predicting standing carbon levels. In addition, we find that improved results
occur when multiple models are combined as opposed to relying any one single
model for mangrove carbon estimates. The high level of carbon contained in
these mangrove forests, combined with the future atmospheric carbon
sequestration potential they offer, makes it a necessity that they are included
in any future payment for ecosystem services strategy aimed at utilizing forest

component analysis (ICA), yet mathematical constraints such as sparse coding
and positivity both provide alternate biologically-plausible frameworks for
generating brain networks. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) would
suppress negative BOLD signal by enforcing positivity. Spatial sparse coding
algorithms ($L1$ Regularized Learning and K-SVD) would impose local
specialization and a discouragement of multitasking, where the total observed
activity in a single voxel originates from a restricted number of possible
brain networks.
  The assumptions of independence, positivity, and sparsity to encode
task-related brain networks are compared; the resulting brain networks for
different constraints are used as basis functions to encode the observed
functional activity at a given time point. These encodings are decoded using
machine learning to compare both the algorithms and their assumptions, using
the time series weights to predict whether a subject is viewing a video,
listening to an audio cue, or at rest, in 304 fMRI scans from 51 subjects.
  For classifying cognitive activity, the sparse coding algorithm of $L1$
Regularized Learning consistently outperformed 4 variations of ICA across
different numbers of networks and noise levels (p$<$0.001). The NMF algorithms,
which suppressed negative BOLD signal, had the poorest accuracy. Within each
algorithm, encodings using sparser spatial networks (containing more
zero-valued voxels) had higher classification accuracy (p$<$0.001). The success
of sparse coding algorithms may suggest that algorithms which enforce sparse
coding, discourage multitasking, and promote local specialization may capture
better the underlying source processes than those which allow inexhaustible
local processes such as ICA.

changes, offs and chirps, which are often associated with important behavioral
contexts, including aggression, hiding and mating. However, these behaviors are
only observed when at least two fish are freely interacting. Although their
electrical pulses can be easily recorded by non-invasive techniques,
discriminating the emitter of each pulse is challenging when physically similar
fish are allowed to freely move and interact. Here we optimized a custom-made
software recently designed to identify the emitter of pulses by using automated
chirp detection, adaptive threshold for pulse detection and slightly changing
how the recorded signals are integrated. With these optimizations, we performed
a quantitative analysis of the statistical changes throughout the dominance
contest with respect to Inter Pulse Intervals, Chirps and Offs dyads of freely
moving Gymnotus carapo. In all dyads, chirps were signatures of subsequent
submission, even when they occurred early in the contest. Although offs were
observed in both dominant and submissive fish, they were substantially more
frequent in submissive individuals, in agreement with the idea from previous
studies that offs are electric cues of submission. In general, after the
dominance is established the submissive fish significantly changes its average
pulse rate, while the pulse rate of the dominant remained unchanged.
Additionally, no chirps or offs were observed when two fish were manually kept
in direct physical contact, suggesting that these electric behaviors are not
automatic responses to physical contact.

dependent on the external stress on the supercell. In 3C-SiC, the Ni single
dopant exhibits an anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) transition at
a moderate compressive and tensile hydrostatic strain in Si-sub and C-sub
cases. In contrast, the Ni single dopant in 4H-SiC is stably in the nonmagnetic
phase under external stress. The Cr single dopant is also insensitive to the
applied stress but stably in the magnetic phase. This strain controlled
magnetic transition makes the Ni single dopant a novel scheme of qubit.

methods is the parameter sensitivity of our core learning algorithms. In many
large-scale applications, online computation and function approximation
represent key strategies in scaling up reinforcement learning algorithms. In
this setting, we have effective and reasonably well understood algorithms for
adapting the learning-rate parameter, online during learning. Such
meta-learning approaches can improve robustness of learning and enable
specialization to current task, improving learning speed. For
temporal-difference learning algorithms which we study here, there is yet
another parameter, $\lambda$, that similarly impacts learning speed and
stability in practice. Unfortunately, unlike the learning-rate parameter,
$\lambda$ parametrizes the objective function that temporal-difference methods
optimize. Different choices of $\lambda$ produce different fixed-point
solutions, and thus adapting $\lambda$ online and characterizing the
optimization is substantially more complex than adapting the learning-rate
parameter. There are no meta-learning method for $\lambda$ that can achieve (1)
incremental updating, (2) compatibility with function approximation, and (3)
maintain stability of learning under both on and off-policy sampling. In this
paper we contribute a novel objective function for optimizing $\lambda$ as a
function of state rather than time. We derive a new incremental, linear
complexity $\lambda$-adaption algorithm that does not require offline batch
updating or access to a model of the world, and present a suite of experiments

underlying asset price is a Brownian motion since they deal with relatively
short time scales. The resulting optimal bid and ask limit order prices tend to
track the underlying price as one might expect. This is indeed the case with
the model of Avellaneda and Stoikov (2008), which has been studied extensively.
We consider here this model under the condition when the underlying price is
mean reverting. Our main result is that when time is far from the terminal, the
optimal price for bid and ask limit orders is constant, which means that it
does not track the underlying price. Numerical simulations confirm this
behavior. When the underlying price is mean reverting, then for times
sufficiently far from terminal, it is more advantageous to focus on the mean
price and ignore fluctuations around it. Mean reversion suggests that limit
orders will be executed with some regularity, and this is why they are optimal.
We also explore intermediate time regimes where limit order prices are
influenced by the inventory of outstanding orders. The duration of this
intermediate regime depends on the liquidity of the market as measured by
specific parameters in the model.

inferred from the observed radio spectral index, $M_{\rm radio}\approx 4.6$,

integrability of the underlying model equation, yet in practice, either
integrable equations are studied or the full extent of Whitham (wave-averaging)
theory is not developed. The governing conduit equation is nonlocal with
nonlinear dispersion and is not integrable. Via a scaling symmetry, periodic
waves can be characterized by their wavenumber and amplitude. In the weakly
nonlinear regime, both the defocusing and focusing variants of the NLS equation
are derived, depending on the wavenumber. Dark and bright envelope solitons are
found to persist in the conduit equation. Due to non-convex dispersion,
modulational instability for periodic waves above a critical wavenumber is
predicted. In the large amplitude regime, structural properties of the Whitham
modulation equations are computed, including strict hyperbolicity, genuine
nonlinearity, and linear degeneracy. Bifurcating from the NLS critical
wavenumber at zero amplitude is an amplitude-dependent elliptic region for the
Whitham equations within which a maximally unstable periodic wave is
identified. These results have implications for dispersive shock waves,

leverages the successful classification network GoogleNet based on
Convolutional Neural Networks to obtain the semantic feature matrix which
contains the serial number of classes and corresponding probabilities. Compared
with traditional image retrieval using feature matching to compute the
similarity between two images, NIST leverages the semantic information to
construct semantic feature matrix and uses the semantic distance algorithm to
compute the similarity. Besides, the fusion strategy can significantly reduce
storage and time consumption due to less classes participating in the last
semantic distance computation. Experiments demonstrate that our NIST framework

applications. Much attention have been paid to study different techniques for
AoA estimation and its applications for jamming suppression, however, security
vulnerability issues of AoA estimation itself under hostile activity have not
been paid the same attention. In this paper, the problem of AoA estimation in
Rician flat fading channel under jamming condition is investigated. We consider
the scenario in which a receiver with multiple antenna is trying to estimate
the AoA of the specular line of sight (LOS) component of signal received from a
given single antenna transmitter using a predefined training sequence. A jammer
equipped with multiple antennas is trying to interrupt the AoA estimation phase
by sending an arbitrary signal. We derive the optimal jammer and receiver
strategies in various scenarios based on the knowledge of the opponent
strategies and the available information about the communication channel. In
all scenarios, we derive the optimal jammer signal design as well as its
optimal power allocation policy. The results show the optimality of the
training based Maximum Likelihood (ML) AoA estimator in case of randomly
generated jamming signal. We also show that, the optimal jammer strategy is to
emit a signal identical to the predefined training sequence turning the
estimation process into a highest power competition scenario in which the
detected AoA is the one for the transmitting entity of higher power. The
obtained results are supported by the provided computer simulation.

reconstruct them, the data owner should gather plural pieces. Shamir's (k,
n)-threshold scheme, in which the data are split into n pieces (shares) for
storage and at least k pieces of them must be gathered for reconstruction,
furnishes information theoretic security, that is, even if attackers could
collect shares of less than the threshold k, they cannot get any information

however, assumed is that data transmission and authentication must be perfectly

pressure data measured by MRI-compatible force sensors was within 5 %,
indicating that the reproducibility of the pressure generated by our cyclic

to impose group-level sparsity on the network's connections, where each group
is defined as the set of outgoing weights from a unit. Depending on the
specific case, the weights can be related to an input variable, to a hidden
neuron, or to a bias unit, thus performing simultaneously all the
aforementioned tasks in order to obtain a compact network. We perform an
extensive experimental evaluation, by comparing with classical weight decay and
Lasso penalties. We show that a sparse version of the group Lasso penalty is
able to achieve competitive performances, while at the same time resulting in
extremely compact networks with a smaller number of input features. We evaluate
both on a toy dataset for handwritten digit recognition, and on multiple
realistic large-scale classification problems.

SGB of the eMSTO cluster NGC 419 is significantly broader at bluer than at

significantly more prolonged than that of the red part of the SGB. This cannot
be explained by assuming an internal age spread. We show that rotational
deceleration of a population of rapidly rotating stars, a currently hotly
debated alternative scenario, naturally explains the observed trend along the
SGB. Our analysis shows that a `converging' SGB could be produced if the
cluster is mostly composed of rapidly rotating stars that slow down over time

the latest Information and Communications (ICT) technology, increasingly
replacing mechanical components of vehicles with electronic components. These
electronic control units (ECUs) communicate with each other in an in-vehicle
network that makes the vehicle both safer and easier to drive. Controller Area
Networks (CANs) are the current standard for such high quality in-vehicle
communication. Unfortunately, however, CANs do not currently offer protection
against security attacks. In particular, they do not allow for message
authentication and hence are open to attacks that replay ECU messages for
malicious purposes. Applying the classic cryptographic method of message
authentication code (MAC) is not feasible since the CAN data frame is not long
enough to include a sufficiently long MAC to provide effective authentication.
In this paper, we propose a novel identification method, which works in the
physical layer of an in-vehicle CAN network. Our method identifies ECUs using
inimitable characteristics of signals enabling detection of a compromised or
alien ECU being used in a replay attack. Unlike previous attempts to address
security issues in the in-vehicle CAN network, our method works by simply
adding a monitoring unit to the existing network, making it deployable in
current systems and compliant with required CAN standards. Our experimental
results show that the bit string and classification algorithm that we utilized
yielded more accurate identification of compromised ECUs than any other method
proposed to date. The false positive rate is more than 2 times lower than the
method proposed by P.-S. Murvay et al. This paper is also the first to identify
potential attack models that systems should be able to detect.

aim is to strike the balance between the computational intensive deep learning

the approaches that focused on the designed parameters but often limited by
sequential computing and cannot scale up. In the evaluation of our approach, it
is shown that DDRL is able to achieve state-of-art classification accuracy
efficiently on both medium and large datasets. The result implies that our
approach is more efficient than the conventional deep learning approaches, and
can be applied to big data that is too complex for parameter designing focused
approaches. More specifically, DDRL contains two main components, i.e., feature
extraction and selection. A hierarchical distributed deep representation
learning algorithm is designed to extract image statistics and a nonlinear
mapping algorithm is used to map the inherent statistics into abstract
features. Both algorithms are carefully designed to avoid millions of
parameters tuning. This leads to a more compact solution for image
classification of big data. We note that the proposed approach is designed to
be friendly with parallel computing. It is generic and easy to be deployed to
different distributed computing resources. In the experiments, the largescale

crosslinking the same. A unique new science that emerges in our attempt to
understand the transfer of the sugar patch and its evolution to a spherical
drop is the elucidation of the mechanics underlying the contact of a deformable
sphere against a solid support intervening a thin liquid film. A unique aspect
of this work is to demonstrate that higher level structures can also be
generated by transferring even smaller nucleation sites on the surface of the
primary lenses and then allowing them to grow by absorption of water vapor.
What results at the end is either a well-controlled distribution of smooth
hemispherical lenses or compound structures that could have potential
applications in the fundamental studies of contact mechanics, wettability and
even in optics.

frequency-selective channels. Conventionally, the loop-back signal at the FD
relay is treated as harmful self-interference and needs to be significantly
suppressed via both analog- and digital-domain cancellation. However, the
performance of the conventional self-interference cancellation approach is
fundamentally limited due to the quantization error induced by the
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with limited dynamic range. In this paper, we
consider an analog filter-and-forward design to help avoid the quantization
error, and surprisingly show that the maximum achievable rate of such an FD-FF
relay system is in fact regardless of the loop-back channel at the FD relay. We
characterize the maximum achievable rate of this channel by jointly optimizing
the transmit power allocation over frequency at the source and the frequency
response of the filter at the relay, subject to their individual power
constraints. Although this problem is non-convex, we obtain its optimal
solution by applying the Lagrange duality method. By simulations it is shown
that the proposed joint source and relay optimization achieves rate gains over
other heuristic designs, and is also advantageous over the conventional
approach by cancelling the relay loop-back signal as self-interference,
especially when the residual self-interference after cancellation is still
significant.

are commonly used in the estimation of the joint eigenstructure of a set of

noise-free, simultaneously diagonalizable ground-truth matrices, the
approximate joint triangularizers are expected to be perturbations of the exact
joint triangularizers of the ground-truth matrices. We provide a priori and a
posteriori perturbation bounds on the `distance' between an approximate joint
triangularizer and its exact counterpart. The a priori bounds are theoretical
inequalities that involve functions of the ground-truth matrices and noise
matrices, whereas the a posteriori bounds are given in terms of observable
quantities that can be computed from the input matrices. From a practical
perspective, the problem of finding the best approximate joint triangularizer
of a set of noisy matrices amounts to solving a nonconvex optimization problem.
We show that, under a condition on the noise level of the input matrices, it is
possible to find a good initial triangularizer such that the solution obtained
by any local descent-type algorithm has certain global guarantees. Finally, we
discuss the application of approximate joint matrix triangularization to

increased transition-metal diffusivity on pristine phosphorene would hinder any

Similar to other two-dimensional materials, metals bind strongly on both

intrinsic semiconduction properties, and also induce a local magnetic moment
with large exchange-splitting and spin-flip energies, which are necessary for
spintronic applications. Specifically, the V/Mn/Fe absorbed at the divacancy
have tremendous promise in this regard. Further, we provide a simple

via $p$-typical Witt vectors. Let $W_n(K)$ be the ring of $p$-typical Witt
vectors of $K$ of length $n$ and let $\wp = F-\mathrm{id}:
W_n(K)\longrightarrow W_n(K)$, where $F$ is the Frobenius map and $\mathrm{id}$

time-reversing symmetry corresponding to CPT invariance of the quantum theory.
The analogous symmetry of the N-extended superparticle is shown to be anomalous
when N is odd, in the supertwistor formalism this is because a CPT-violating
worldline-Chern-Simons term is needed to preserve the chiral U(1) gauge
invariance. This accords with the fact that no massless N=1 super-Poincar\'e
irrep is CPT-self-conjugate. There is a CPT self-conjugate supermultiplet when
N is even, but it has $2^{N+1}$ states when N/2 is odd (e.g. the N=2
hypermultiplet) in contrast to just $2^N$ when N/2 is even (e.g. the N=4
Maxwell supermultiplet). This is shown to follow from a Kramers degeneracy of
the superparticle state space when N/2 is odd.

  Counting GC",,,,"euroscipy-proceedings2015-01","cs.PL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Jython is a Java-based Python implementation and the most seamless way to
integrate Python and Java. It achieves high efficiency by compiling Python code
to Java bytecode and thus letting Java's JIT optimize it - an approach that
enables Python code to call Java functions or to subclass Java classes. It
enables Python code to leverage Java's multithreading features and utilizes
Java's built-in garbage collection (GC). However, it currently does not support
CPython's C-API and thus does not support native extensions like NumPy and
SciPy. Since most scientific code depends on such extensions, it is not
runnable with Jython. Jython Native Interface (JyNI) is a compatibility layer
that aims to provide CPython's native C extension API on top of Jython. JyNI is
implemented using the Java Native Interface (JNI) and its native part is
designed to be binary compatible with existing extension builds [...].

solver for unstructured grids. It is designed to efficiently solve the
compressible Navier-Stokes equations on a range of hardware platforms,

Infrastructure for the Intel Many Integrated Core Architecture (pyMIC) was used
to enable PyFR to run with near native performance on the Intel Xeon Phi
coprocessor. We will introduce the architecture of both pyMIC and PyFR and
present a variety of examples showcasing the capabilities of pyMIC. Further, we
will also compare the contrast pyMIC to other approaches including native
execution and OpenCL. The process of adding support for pyMIC into PyFR will be
described in detail. Benchmark results show that for a standard cylinder flow
problem PyFR with pyMIC is able achieve 240 GFLOP/s of sustained double
precision floating point performance; for a 1.85 times improvement over PyFR
with C/OpenMP on a 12 core Intel Xeon E5-2697 v2 CPU.

scientific Python DNS code is described that nearly matches the performance of
pure C for thousands of processors and billions of unknowns. With optimization
of a few routines in Cython, it is found to match the performance of a more or
less identical solver implemented from scratch in C++. Keys to the efficiency
of the solver are the mesh decomposition and three dimensional FFT routines,
implemented directly in Python using MPI, wrapped through MPI for Python, and a
serial FFT module (both numpy.fft or pyFFTW may be used). Two popular
decomposition strategies, slab and pencil, have been implemented and tested.

nucleon, we calculate the azimuthal single spin asymmetry of unpolarized
electrons elastically scattered from a transversely polarized nucleon target.
The azimuthal asymmetry in this case is attributed to the fact that in a
transversely polarized nucleon, the transverse charge density is no longer
axially symmetric and is distorted due to the transverse spin of the nucleon.
This asymmetry in the nucleon charge density causes a left-right asymmetry in
the azimuthal distribution of the scattered electrons. In our approach, we
utilize the relativistic Eikonal approximation to calculate the one and two
photon exchange amplitudes from which a non zero azimuthal asymmetry appears
due to the interference between the two amplitudes.

medium bounded underneath by a flatbed and an upper medium with a free surface
with wind generated surface waves but considered bounded above by a lid by an
assumption that surface waves have negligible amplitude. An internal wave
driven by gravity which propagates in the positive $x$-direction acts as a free
common interface between the media. The current is such that it is zero at the
flatbed but a negative constant, due to an assumption that surface winds blow
in the negative $x$-direction, at the lid. We are concerned with the layers
adjacent to the internal wave in which there exists a depth dependent current
for which there is a greater underlying than overlying current. Both media are
considered incompressible and having non-zero constant vorticities. The
governing equations are written in canonical Hamiltonian form in terms of the
variables, associated to the wave (in a presence of a constant current). The
resultant equations of motion show that wave-current interaction is influenced
only by the current profile in the 'strip' adjacent to the internal wave.

relevance to exploring the effects which a predominantly linear scattering
lattice may have upon interior radiant transport. Indeed, a central feature of
electromagnetic wave propagation within such a lattice, if sufficiently dilute,
is ray confinement to cones whose half-angles are set by that between lattice
and the incident ray. When such propagation is subordinated to a viewpoint of
photon transport, one arrives at a somewhat simplified variant of the Boltzmann
equation with spherical scattering demoted to its cylindrical counterpart. With
a view to initiating a hopefully wider discussion of such phenomena, we follow
through in detail the half-space albedo problem. This is done first along
canonical lines that harness the Wiener-Hopf technique, and then once more in a
discrete ordinates setting via flux decomposition along the eigenbasis of the
underlying attenuation/scattering matrix. Good agreement is seen to prevail. We
further suggest that the Case singular eigenfunction apparatus could likewise
be evolved here in close analogy to its original, spherical scattering model.
