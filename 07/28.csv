predict the existence of field-free or dynamically weak-field regions in the
deep Photosphere. To confirm or rule out the existence of weak-field regions in
the deepest photospheric layers of the penumbra. The magnetic field at
$\log\tau_5=0$ is investigated by means of inversions of spectropolarimetric
data of two different sunspots located very close to disk center with a spatial
resolution of approximately 0.4-0.45 arcsec. The data have been recorded using
the GRIS instrument attached to the 1.5-meters GREGOR solar telescope at El
Teide observatory. It includes three Fe I lines around 1565 nm, whose
sensitivity to the magnetic field peaks at half a pressure-scale-height deeper
than the sensitivity of the widely used Fe I spectral line pair at 630 nm.
Prior to the inversion, the data is corrected for the effects of scattered
light using a deconvolution method with several point spread functions. At
$\log\tau_5=0$ we find no evidence for the existence of regions with
dynamically weak ($B<500$ Gauss) magnetic fields in sunspot penumbrae. This
result is much more reliable than previous investigations done with Fe I lines
at 630 nm. Moreover, the result is independent of the number of nodes employed
in the inversion, and also independent of the point spread function used to
deconvolve the data, and does not depend on the amount of straylight (i.e.
wide-angle scattered light) considered.

Many Android malware families employ obfuscation techniques in order to avoid

analysis on the other hand may be used to overcome this limitation. Hence in
this paper we propose DynaLog, a dynamic analysis based framework for
characterizing Android applications. The framework provides the capability to
analyse the behaviour of applications based on an extensive number of dynamic
features. It provides an automated platform for mass analysis and
characterization of apps that is useful for quickly identifying and isolating
malicious applications. The DynaLog framework leverages existing open source
tools to extract and log high level behaviours, API calls, and critical events
that can be used to explore the characteristics of an application, thus
providing an extensible dynamic analysis platform for detecting Android
malware. DynaLog is evaluated using real malware samples and clean applications
demonstrating its capabilities for effective analysis and detection of
malicious applications.

the quantum setting, i.e., between strategies where the adversary can or cannot
adaptively base its action on some auxiliary quantum side information. Our
relation holds in a very general setting, and is applicable as long as we can
control the bit-size of the side information, or, more generally, its
""information content"". Since adaptivity is notoriously difficult to handle in
the analysis of (quantum) cryptographic protocols, this gives us a very
powerful tool: as long as we have enough control over the side information, it
is sufficient to restrict ourselves to non-adaptive attacks.
  We demonstrate the usefulness of this methodology with two examples. The
first is a quantum bit commitment scheme based on 1-bit cut-and-choose. Since
bit commitment implies oblivious transfer (in the quantum setting), and
oblivious transfer is universal for two-party computation, this implies the
universality of 1-bit cut-and-choose, and thus solves the main open problem of
[FKSZZ13]. The second example is a quantum bit commitment scheme proposed in
1993 by Brassard et al. It was originally suggested as an unconditionally
secure scheme, back when this was thought to be possible. We partly restore the
scheme by proving it secure in (a variant of) the bounded quantum storage
model.
  In both examples, the fact that the adversary holds quantum side information
obstructs a direct analysis of the scheme, and we circumvent it by analyzing a
non-adaptive version, which can be done by means of known techniques, and
applying our main result.

novel and cannot be easily reproduced in a frequentist framework. We compare
our estimators to those based on estimating equation and generalized methods of

energy state of the system subject to the constraint of constant angular
momentum. Due to the lack of a closed form solution for the full three-body
problem, however, we must use use an approximate description of the orbits. We
first consider the Keplerian limit and find that the critical energy states are
saddle points, rather than minima, so that these hierarchical systems have no
stable tidal equilibrium states. We then generalize the calculation so that the
lunar orbit is described by a time-averaged version of the circular restricted
three-body problem. In this latter case, the critical energy state is a shallow
minimum, so that a tidal equilibrium state exists. In both cases, however, the
lunar orbit for the critical point lies outside the boundary (roughly half the
Hill radius) where (previous) numerical simulations indicate dynamical
instability. These results suggest that star-planet-moon systems have no viable
long-term stable states analogous to those found for two-body systems.

X-ray emitting stationary shocks in protostellar jets, the role of the magnetic
field in determining the location, stability, and detectability in X-rays of
these shocks, and the physical properties of the shocked plasma. We performed a
set of 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations modelling
supersonic jets ramming into a magnetized medium and explored different
configurations of the magnetic field. The model takes into account the most
relevant physical effects, namely thermal conduction and radiative losses. We
compared the model results with observations, via the emission measure and the
X-ray luminosity synthesized from the simulations. Our model explains the
formation of X-ray emitting stationary shocks in a natural way. The magnetic
field collimates the plasma at the base of the jet and forms there a magnetic
nozzle. After an initial transient, the nozzle leads to the formation of a
shock diamond at its exit which is stationary over the time covered by the
simulations (~ 40 - 60 yr; comparable with time scales of the observations).
The shock generates a point-like X-ray source located close to the base of the
jet with luminosity comparable with that inferred from X-ray observations of
protostellar jets. For the range of parameters explored, the evolution of the
post-shock plasma is dominated by the radiative cooling, whereas the thermal

the conditions in the outer core of the Mega-Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST). A
parameter scan in the local values of the ion-temperature gradient and flow
shear is performed. It is demonstrated that the experimentally observed state
is near the stability threshold and that this stability threshold is nonlinear:
sheared turbulence is subcritical, i.e. the system is formally stable to small
perturbations, but, given a large enough initial perturbation, it transitions
to a turbulent state. A scenario for such a transition is proposed and
supported by numerical results: close to threshold, the nonlinear saturated
state and the associated anomalous heat transport are dominated by long-lived
coherent structures, which drift across the domain, have finite amplitudes, but
are not volume filling; as the system is taken away from the threshold into the
more unstable regime, the number of these structures increases until they
overlap and a more conventional chaotic state emerges. Whereas this appears to
represent a new scenario for transition to turbulence in tokamak plasmas, it is
reminiscent of the behaviour of other subcritically turbulent systems, e.g.
pipe flows and Keplerian magnetorotational accretion flows.

predict the cross-spectrum between two energy bands in addition to their power

provides a better fit to the data than the old single hump model for most of

state to the stable equilibrium point. This is a new control paradigm that does
not rely on any continuous measurement or load shedding, as in the classical
setup. Instead, the grid is made stable by discretely relocating the
equilibrium point and its stability region such that the system is
consecutively attracted from the fault-cleared state back to the original
equilibrium point. The proposed control is designed by solving linear and
convex optimization problems, making it possibly scalable to large-scale power
grids. Finally, this emergency control scheme can be implemented by exploiting
transmission facilities available on the existing grids.

While perfect
matchings in planar graphs can be counted by a classical polynomial-time
algorithm, the problem of counting all matchings (possibly containing unmatched
vertices, also known as defects) is known to be #P-complete on planar graphs.
To interpolate between the hard case of counting matchings and the easy case of
counting perfect matchings, we study the parameterized problem of counting
matchings with exactly k unmatched vertices in a planar graph G, on input G and
k. This setting has a natural interpretation in statistical physics, and it is
a special case of counting perfect matchings in k-apex graphs (graphs that can
be turned planar by removing at most k vertices).
  Starting from a recent #W[1]-hardness proof for counting perfect matchings on
k-apex graphs, we obtain that counting matchings with k unmatched vertices in
planar graphs is #W[1]-hard. In contrast, given a plane graph G with s
distinguished faces, there is an $O(2^s \cdot n^3)$ time algorithm for counting
those matchings with k unmatched vertices such that all unmatched vertices lie
on the distinguished faces. This implies an $f(k,s)\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time
algorithm for counting perfect matchings in k-apex graphs whose apex
neighborhood is covered by s faces.

three primary physical-layer differences relative to fourth-generation ones:
millimeter-wave propagation, massive antenna arrays, and densification of base

to continue to use single-carrier frequency division multiple-access (SC-FDMA)
on the uplink due to its advantageous peak-to-average power ratio. Moreover, 5G
systems are likely to use frequency hopping on the uplink to help randomize
interference and provide diversity against frequency-selective fading. In this
paper, the implications of these and other physical-layer features on uplink
performance are assessed using a novel millimeter-wave propagation model
featuring distance-dependent parameters that characterize the path-loss,
shadowing, and fading. The analysis proceeds by first fixing the location of
the mobile devices and finding the performance conditioned on the topology. The
spatially averaged performance is then found by averaging with respect to the
location of the mobile devices. The analysis allows for the use of actual
base-station topologies and the propagation model can leverage empirical
millimeter-wave measurements. The benefits of base-station densification,
highly directional sectorization, frequency hopping, a large available

of the chain is equivalent to the minimum energy state of the tight-binding
model in the subspace of one-particle states with uniform density. To satisfy
the constraint of uniform density, the superconducting state of the ladder is
written as a linear combination of the allowed k-states of the tight-binding
model with open boundaries. Above a critical value of the parameter t (ratio
between the intra-rung and inter-rung Josephson couplings), the ladder
spontaneously develop currents at the edges which spread to the bulk as t is
increased until complete coverage is reached. Above a certain value of t, which
varies with ladder size (t = 1 for an infinite-sized ladder), the edge currents
are destroyed. The value t = 1 corresponds, in the tight-binding model, to the
opening of a gap between two bands. We argue that the disappearance of the edge

integrate for the first time big data resources to quantify the impact of
events and propose target strategies for collective good at urban scale. In the
context of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, we first predict the expected
increase in traffic. To that end, we integrate data from: mobile phones,
Airbnb, Waze, and transit information, with game schedules and information of
venues. Next, we evaluate the impact of the Olympic Games to the travel of
commuters, and propose different route choice scenarios during the peak hours.
Moreover, we gather information on the trips that contribute the most to the
global congestion and that could be redirected from vehicles to transit.
Interestingly, we show that (i) following new route alternatives during the
event with individual shortest path can save more collective travel time than
keeping the routine routes, uncovering the positive value of information
technologies during events; (ii) with only a small proportion of people
selected from specific areas switching from driving to public transport, the
collective travel time can be reduced to a great extent. Results are presented
on-line for the evaluation of the public and policy makers.

applying it to a two-dimensional diffusive random laser and a microdisk laser.
Achieving highly multimode lasing at reasonable pump powers is useful for
reducing the spatial coherence of laser sources, making them suitable for use

  most fMRI studies?",,,,,"stat.AP physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Random Field Theory has been used in the fMRI literature to address the
multiple comparisons problem. The method provides an analytical solution for
the computation of precise p-values when its assumptions are met. When its
assumptions are not met the thresholds generated by Random Field Theory can be
more conservative than Bonferroni corrections, which are arguably too stringent
for use in fMRI. As this has been well documented theoretically it is
surprising that a majority of current studies (~80%) would not meet the
assumptions of Random Field Theory and therefore would have reduced
sensitivity. Specifically most data is not smooth enough to meet the good
lattice assumption. Current studies smooth data on average by twice the voxel
size which is rarely sufficient to meet the good lattice assumption. The amount
of smoothing required for Random Field Theory to produce accurate p-values
increases with image resolution and decreases with degrees of freedom. There is
no rule of thumb that is valid for all study designs but for typical data (3mm
resolution, and greater than 20 subjects) residual smoothness with FWHM = 4
times voxel size should produce valid results. However, it should be stressed
that for higher spatial resolution and lower degrees of freedom the critical
smoothness required will increase sharply. This implies that researchers should
carefully choose appropriate smoothing kernels. This can be facilitated by the
simulations we provide that identify the critical smoothness at which the
application of RFT becomes appropriate. For some applications such as
presurgical mapping or, imaging of small structures, probing the
laminar/columnar structure of the cortex these smoothness requirements may be
too great to preserve spatial structure. As such, this study suggests
developments are needed in Random Field Theory to fully exploit the resolution
of modern neuroimaging.

Next, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model

using mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results
show reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort

ultra-light axions (ULAs) with mass in the range $10^{-32}~{\rm eV} \to
10^{-26}~{\rm eV}$ compose a fraction $< 0.01$ of the cosmological critical
density. Here, the sensitivity of a proposed CMB-Stage IV (CMB-S4) experiment
(assuming a 1 arcmin beam and $< 1~\mu K{\rm-arcmin}$ noise levels over a sky
fraction of 0.4) to the density of ULAs and other dark-sector components is
assessed. CMB-S4 data should be $\sim 10$ times more sensitive to the ULA
energy-density than Planck data alone, across a wide range of ULA masses
$10^{-32}< m_{a}< 10^{-23}~{\rm eV}$, and will probe axion decay constants of
$f_{a}\approx 10^{16}~{\rm GeV}$, at the grand unified scale. CMB-S4 could
improve the CMB lower bound on the ULA mass from $\sim 10^{-25}~{\rm eV}$ to
$10^{-23}~{\rm eV}$, nearing the mass range probed by dwarf galaxy abundances
and dark-matter halo density profiles. These improvements will allow for a
multi-$\sigma$ detection of percent-level departures from CDM over a wide range
of masses. Much of this improvement is driven by the effects of weak
gravitational lensing on the CMB, which breaks degeneracies between ULAs and
neutrinos. We also find that the addition of ULA parameters does not
significantly degrade the sensitivity of the CMB to neutrino masses. These
results were obtained using the axionCAMB code (a modification to the CAMB

of angular momentum between the core neutron superfluid and the rest of the
star within a two-fluid model including both (non-dissipative) entrainment
effects and (dissipative) mutual friction forces. Our simulations are based on
a quasi-stationary approach using realistic equations of state (EoSs). We show
that the evolution of the angular velocities of both fluids can be accurately
described by an exponential law. The associated characteristic rise time
$\tau_{\text{r}}$, which can be precisely computed from stationary
configurations only, has a form similar to that obtained in the Newtonian
limit. However, general relativity changes the structure of the star and leads
to additional couplings between the fluids due to frame-dragging effects. As a
consequence, general relativity can have a large impact on the actual value of
$\tau_{\text{r}}$: the errors incurred by using Newtonian gravity are thus
found to be as large as $\sim 40 \%$ for the models considered. Values of the
rise time are calculated for Vela and compared with current observational
limits. Finally, we study the amount of gravitational waves emitted during a
glitch. Simple expressions are obtained for the corresponding characteristic
amplitudes and frequencies. The detectability of glitches through gravitational

industrial settings has resulted in the development of increasingly
sophisticated algorithms for releasing information while preserving privacy.
Accompanying this phenomenon is the natural rise in the development and
publication of incorrect algorithms, thus demonstrating the necessity of formal
verification tools. However, existing formal methods for differential privacy
face a dilemma: methods based on customized logics can verify sophisticated
algorithms but come with a steep learning curve and significant annotation
burden on the programmers, while existing programming platforms lack expressive
power for some sophisticated algorithms.
  In this paper, we present LightDP, a simple imperative language that strikes
a better balance between expressive power and usability. The core of LightDP is
a novel relational type system that separates relational reasoning from privacy
budget calculations. With dependent types, the type system is powerful enough
to verify sophisticated algorithms where the composition theorem falls short.
In addition, the inference engine of LightDP infers most of the proof details,
and even searches for the proof with minimal privacy cost bound when multiple
proofs exist. We show that LightDP verifies sophisticated algorithms with
little manual effort.

determine their frequency. We developed a pipeline for a uniform processing of
all the data that we have recorded with NIRC2/Keck II, NIRI/Gemini North,
NICI/Gemini South, and NACO/VLT for 14 years. The pipeline first applies
cosmetic corrections and then reduces the speckle intensity to enhance the
contrast in the images. The main result of the international deep planet survey
is the discovery of the HR 8799 exoplanets. We also detected 59 visual multiple
systems including 16 new binary stars and 2 new triple stellar systems, as well
as 2,279 point-like sources. We used Monte Carlo simulations and the Bayesian
theorem to determine that 1.05[+2.80-0.70]% of stars harbor at least one giant
planet between 0.5 and 14M_J and between 20 and 300 AU. This result is obtained
assuming uniform distributions of planet masses and semi-major axes. If we
consider power law distributions as measured for close-in planets instead, the
derived frequency is 2.30[+5.95-1.55]%, recalling the strong impact of
assumptions on Monte Carlo output distributions. We also find no evidence that
the derived frequency depends on the mass of the hosting star, whereas it does
for close-in planets. The international deep planet survey provides a database
of confirmed background sources that may be useful for other exoplanet direct
imaging surveys. It also puts new constraints on the number of stars with at
least one giant planet reducing by a factor of two the frequencies derived by
almost all previous works.

connected to the proton's valence quarks. We estimate the prompt neutrino
spectrum due to intrinsic charm. We find that the atmospheric prompt neutrino
flux from intrinsic charm is comparable to those calculated using QCD
computations not including intrinsic charm, once we normalize the intrinsic

only couple to the neutral sector, and leave the phase transition of the

may alter this phase transition from a $3DXY$ inverted phase transition into a
first-order phase transition depending on what the values of the gauge-charge

more pronounced with increasing number of components $N$, since the number of
charge-neutral fluctuating modes that can influence the charged sector
increases with $N$. We also calculate the gauge-field correlator, and by
extension the Higgs mass, in terms of current-current correlators. We show that

nodes is rooted in the non-unitary nature of chiral pairing in
spin-orbit-coupled superconductors. We address experimental signatures of
Majorana fermions, and find that the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin
relaxation rate is significantly suppressed for nuclear spins polarized along
the nodal direction as a consequence of the spin-selective Majorana nature of
nodal quasiparticles. Furthermore, Majorana nodes in the bulk have nontrivial
topology and imply the presence of Majorana bound states on the surface that

Structure in Galaxies (S4G). We find that among massive galaxies
($M_{star}/M_{sun}> 10^{10}$), longer bars tend to reside in inner discs having
a flatter radial profile. Such galaxies show a light deficit in the disc
surrounding the bar, within the bar radius and often show a $\Theta$-shaped
morphology. We quantify this deficit and find that among all galaxies explored
in this study (with $10^{9}<M_{star}/M_{sun}< 10^{11}$), galaxies with a
stronger bar (i.e. longer and/or with a higher Bar/T) show a more pronounced
deficit. We also examine simulation snapshots to confirm and extend results by
Athanassoula and Misiriotis, showing that as bars evolve they become longer,
while the light deficit in the disc becomes more pronounced. Theoretical
studies have predicted that, as a barred galaxy evolves, the bar captures disc
stars in its immediate neighbourhood so as to make the bar longer, stronger and
thinner. Hence, we claim that the light deficit in the inner disc is produced
by bars, which thus take part in shaping the mass distribution of their host
galaxies.

decrease rapidly with redshift at $z \ge 6$, after a gradual increase at $z<
6$. This has been interpreted as a hint of the reionization of the
intergalactic medium (IGM): the emitted Ly$\alpha$ photons would be scattered
by an increasingly neutral IGM at $z>6$. We study this effect by modeling the
ionization and Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer in the infall region and the IGM
around a Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxy (LAE), for a spherical halo model with the
mean density and radial velocity profiles in the standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological scenario. We find that the expected fast increase of the ionizing
background intensity toward the end of the reionization epoch implies a rapid
evolution of halo infall regions from being self-shielded against the external
ionizing background to being mostly ionized. Whereas self-shielded infall
regions can scatter the Ly$\alpha$ photons over a much larger area than the
commonly used apertures for observing LAEs, the same infalling gas is no longer
optically thick to the Ly$\alpha$ emission line after it is ionized by the
external background, making the Ly$\alpha$ emission more compact and brighter
within the observed apertures. Based on this simple model, we show that the
observed drop in the abundance of LAEs at $z>6$ does not imply a rapid increase
with redshift of the fraction of the whole IGM volume that is atomic, but is
accounted for by a rapid increase of the neutral fraction in the infall regions
around galaxy host halos.

observations of M101 OT2015-1 (PSN J14021678+5426205), a luminous red transient
in the Pinwheel galaxy (M101), spanning a total of 16 years. The lightcurve
showed two distinct peaks with absolute magnitudes $M_r\leq-12.4$ and $M_r
\simeq-12$, on 2014 November 11 and 2015 February 17, respectively. The
spectral energy distributions during the second maximum show a cool outburst
temperature of $\approx$3700 K and low expansion velocities ($\approx-$300
\kms) for the H I, Ca II, Ba II and K I lines. From archival data spanning 15
to 8 years before the outburst, we find a single source consistent with the
optically discovered transient which we attribute to being the progenitor; it
has properties consistent with being an F-type yellow supergiant with
$L$~$\sim$~8.7~$\times\ 10^4$ \Lsun, $T_{\rm{eff}}\approx$7000~K and an
estimated mass of $\rm{M1}= 18\pm 1$ \Msun. This star has likely just finished
the H burning phase in the core, started expanding, and is now crossing the
Hertzsprung gap. Based on the combination of observed properties, we argue that
the progenitor is a binary system, with the more evolved system overfilling the
Roche lobe. Comparison with binary evolution models suggests that the outburst
was an extremely rare phenomenon, likely associated with the ejection of the
common envelope. The initial mass of the binary progenitor system fills the gap
between the merger candidates V838 Mon (5$-$10 \Msun) and
NGC~4490-OT~(30~\Msun).

evolution within ""transition"" discs. We demonstrate quantitatively that the
predicted and observed structure of such discs are prime birthsites of planets.
Planet formation is likely to proceed through pebble accretion, should a
planetary embryo ($M\gtrsim 10^{-4}\,$M$_\oplus$) form. Efficient pebble
accretion is likely to be unavoidable in transition disc dust traps, as the
size of the dust particles required for pebble accretion are those which are
most efficiently trapped in the transition disc dust trap. Rapid pebble
accretion within the dust trap gives rise, not only to low-mass planets, but to
a large accretion luminosity. This accretion luminosity is sufficient to heat
the disc outside the gravitational influence of the planet and makes the disc
locally baroclinic, and a source of vorticity. Using numerical simulations we
demonstrate that this source of vorticity can lead to the growth of a single
large scale vortex in $\sim 100$ orbits, which is capable of trapping
particles. Finally, we suggest an evolutionary cycle: planet formation proceeds
through pebble accretion, followed by vortex formation and particle trapping in
the vortex quenching the planetary accretion and thus removing the vorticity
source. After the vortex is destroyed the process can begin anew. This means
transition discs should present with large scale vortices for a significant
fraction of their lifetimes and remnant planets at large ~10AU separation
should be a common outcome of this cycle.

(H2) in a series of disk galaxies simulated using the AREPO moving-mesh code.
In conditions similar to those in the Milky Way, we find that H2 has a flat
temperature distribution ranging from 10 - 100 K. At $T < 30$ K the gas is
almost fully molecular and has a high CO content, whereas at $T > 30$ K, the H2
fraction spans a broader range and the CO content is small, allowing us to
classify gas in these two regimes as CO-bright and CO-dark, respectively. The
mean sound speed in the CO-dark H2 is 0.64 km/s, significantly lower than the
value in the cold atomic gas (1.15 km/s), implying that the CO-dark molecular
phase is more susceptible to turbulent compression and gravitational collapse
than its atomic counterpart. We further show that the temperature of the
CO-dark H2 is highly sensitive to the strength of the interstellar radiation
field, but that conditions in the CO-bright H2 remain largely unchanged.
Finally, we examine the usefulness of the [CII] and [OI] fine structure lines
as tracers of the CO-dark gas. We show that in Milky Way-like conditions,
diffuse [CII] emission from this gas should be detectable. However, it is a
problematic tracer of this gas, as there is only a weak correlation between the
brightness of the emission and the H2 surface density. The situation is even
worse for the [OI] line, which shows no correlation with the H2 surface
density.

We do this with respect to the space-time singularity problem. The essential
difference between the usual differential geometry and SDG is that the latter
enriches the real line by introducing infinitesimal of various kinds. Owing to
this geometry acquires a tool to penetrate ""infinitesimally small"" parts of a
given manifold. However, to make use of this tool we must switch from the
category of sets to some other suitable category. We try two topoi: the topos
${\cal G}$ of germ determined ideals and the so-called Basel topos ${\cal B}$.
The category of manifolds is a subcategory of both of them. In ${\cal G}$, we
construct a simple model of a contracting sphere. As the sphere shrinks, its
curvature increases, but when the radius of the sphere reaches infinitesimal
values, the curvature becomes infinitesimal and the singularity is avoided. The
topos ${\cal B}$, unlike the topos ${\cal G}$, has invertible infinitesimal and
infinitely large nonstandard natural numbers. This allows us to see what
happens when a function ""goes through a singularity"". When changing from the
category of sets to another topos, one must be ready to switch from classical
logic to intuitionistic logic. This is a radical step, but the logic of the

more massive. Isolated white dwarfs emit most of their power from ultraviolet
to near-infrared wavelengths, but when in close orbits with less dense stars,
white dwarfs can strip material from their companions, and the resulting mass
transfer can generate atomic line and X-ray emission, as well as near- and
mid-infrared radiation if the white dwarf is magnetic. However, even in
binaries, white dwarfs are rarely detected at far-infrared or radio
frequencies. Here we report the discovery of a white dwarf / cool star binary
that emits from X-ray to radio wavelengths. The star, AR Scorpii (henceforth AR
Sco), was classified in the early 1970s as a delta-Scuti star, a common variety
of periodic variable star. Our observations reveal instead a 3.56 hr period
close binary, pulsing in brightness on a period of 1.97 min. The pulses are so
intense that AR Sco's optical flux can increase by a factor of four within 30
s, and they are detectable at radio frequencies, the first such detection for
any white dwarf system. They reflect the spin of a magnetic white dwarf which
we find to be slowing down on a 10^7 yr timescale. The spin-down power is an
order of magnitude larger than that seen in electromagnetic radiation, which,
together with an absence of obvious signs of accretion, suggests that AR Sco is
primarily spin-powered. Although the pulsations are driven by the white dwarf's
spin, they originate in large part from the cool star. AR Sco's broad-band
spectrum is characteristic of synchrotron radiation, requiring relativistic
electrons. These must either originate from near the white dwarf or be
generated in situ at the M star through direct interaction with the white
dwarf's magnetosphere.

small amplitude in viscous fluids using an analytically derived solution to the
initial value problem of a small-amplitude capillary wave as well as direct
numerical simulation. A rational parametrization for the dispersion of
capillary waves in the underdamped regime is proposed, including predictions
for the wavenumber of critical damping based on a harmonic oscillator model.
The scaling resulting from this parametrization leads to a self-similar
solution of the frequency dispersion of capillary waves that covers the entire
underdamped regime, which allows an accurate evaluation of the frequency at a
given wavenumber, irrespective of the fluid properties. This similarity also
reveals characteristic features of capillary waves, for instance that critical
damping occurs when the characteristic timescales of dispersive and dissipative
mechanisms are balanced. In addition, the presented results suggest that the
widely adopted hydrodynamic theory for damped capillary waves does not
accurately predict the dispersion when viscous damping is significant and a new
definition of the damping rate, which provides consistent accuracy in the
underdamped regime, is presented.

from a manifold-without-boundary M onto an ANR Q, it is a much-studied problem
to find when f is approximable by homeomorphisms, i.e., when the decomposition
of M induced by f is shrinkable (in the sense of Bing). If dimension M $\geq$
5, J. W. Cannon's recent work focuses attention on whether Q has the disjoint
disc property (which is: Any two maps of a 2-disc into Q can be homotoped by an
arbitrarily small amount to have disjoint images; this is clearly a necessary
condition for Q to be a manifold, in this dimension range). This paper
establishes that such an f is approximable by homeomorphisms whenever dimension
M $\geq$ 5 and Q has the disjoint disc property. As a corollary, one obtains
that given an arbitrary map f : M $\rightarrow$ Q as above, the stabilized map
f $\times$ id($\mathbb{R}^{2}$) : M $\times$ $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ -> Q $\times$
$\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is approximable by homeomorphisms. The proof of the theorem is
different from the proofs of the special cases in the earlier work of myself

impractical, and design a distributed semi-online algorithm which meets
performance guarantees in equilibrium and can be shown to quickly converge to a
region around the equilibrium point. Building on this algorithm, we devise a
practical approach with limited computational, information, and handoff

optical pumping and two-photon absorption peaks are explicitly narrower than
that obtained with a Gaussian field. In next section, it is shown that,
comparing with the the Gaussian fields, the Laguerre-Gaussian ones reduce the

Interestingly, it turns out that its use of a Laguerre-Gaussian beam makes the
linewidth of the spectrum narrower as compared with a Gaussian one in a
Doppler-broadened electromagnetically induced transparency. Moreover, we study
the effect of the laser profile on the Autler-Townes doublet structure in the
absorption spectrum for a laser-driven four-level atomic system. We also
consider the different values of the Laguerre-Gaussian mode beam waist, and,
perhaps more remarkable, we find that for the small values of waist, the
Autler-Townes doublet can be removed and a prominent narrow central peak
appears in the absorption spectrum. Finally, we investigate the effect of the

using laser-guided adaptive optics observations from the W. M. Keck

light curves. The OB120169 light curve is well-fit by a single-lens model,
while both OB110022 and OB110125 light curves favor binary-lens models. Using
the photometric fits as prior information, no significant astrometric lensing
signal was detected and all targets were consistent with linear motion. The
significant lack of astrometric signal constrains the lens mass of OB110022 to
0.05-1.79 Msun in a 99.7% confidence interval, which disfavors a black hole
lens. Fits to OB110125 yielded a reduced Einstein crossing time and
insufficient observations during the peak, so no mass limits were obtained. Two
degenerate solutions exist for OB120169, which have a lens mass between

Three phases are distinguished. For $n_\text{max}=1$ a gas of clusters form,
with sizes distributed exponentially and no coarsening takes place. For
$n_\text{max}\geq 3$ and small values of $\alpha$, coarsening takes place and
few large clusters appear, with a large fraction of the total number of
particles in them. In the same range of $n_\text{max}$ but for larger values of
$\alpha$, a gas phase where a negligible fraction of particles takes part of
clusters. Finally, $n_\text{max}=2$ corresponds to a crossover phase. The
character of the transitions between phases is studied extending the model to
allow $n_\text{max}$ to take real values and jumps to an occupied site are
probabilistic. The transition from the gas of clusters to the coarsening phase
is continuous and the mass of the large clusters grows continuously when
varying the maximum occupancy, and the crossover found corresponds to values
close to the transition. The second transition, from the coarsening to the
gaseous phase can be either continuous or discontinuous depending on the
parameters, with a critical point separating both cases.

beings, thereby entangling an understanding of human values with future
technological development. Contemporary research accomplishments suggest
sophisticated AI systems becoming widespread and responsible for managing many
aspects of the modern world, from preemptively planning users' travel schedules
and logistics, to fully autonomous vehicles, to domestic robots assisting in
daily living. The extrapolation of these trends has been most forcefully
described in the context of a hypothetical ""intelligence explosion,"" in which
the capabilities of an intelligent software agent would rapidly increase due to
the presence of feedback loops unavailable to biological organisms. The
possibility of superintelligent agents, or simply the widespread deployment of
sophisticated, autonomous AI systems, highlights an important theoretical
problem: the need to separate the cognitive and rational capacities of an agent
from the fundamental goal structure, or value system, which constrains and
guides the agent's actions. The ""value alignment problem"" is to specify a goal
structure for autonomous agents compatible with human values. In this brief
article, we suggest that recent ideas from affective neuroscience and related
disciplines aimed at characterizing neurological and behavioral universals in
the mammalian class provide important conceptual foundations relevant to
describing human values. We argue that the notion of ""mammalian value systems""
points to a potential avenue for fundamental research in AI safety and AI
ethics.

chemical complexity and electron deficiency of B atoms, the 2D boron sheets are
easy affected by the environment. So, exploring novel 2D boron oxides gets
highly needed. In this study, we theoretically explored 2D boron oxides
structures and their basic properties. We found 2D boron oxides are metals or
semimetals, when oxygen concentration is low. More interesting, the B6O1
exhibits Dirac Loop near the Fermi level and the maximum Fermi velocity is
estimated as high as 0.61*10E6 m/s, which much close to that in graphene. In
addition, when the oxygen concentration is one forth, the most stable B4O1 get
a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.24 eV and a strong anisotropic
carrier mobility. Such huge differences of carrier mobility between two
directions have not been reported in other 2D materials. Besides, when oxygen
concentra-tion is higher than one forth, the 2D boron sheets will get unstable
based our results. We also proposed a method how to synthesize these systems.
Our work provide a basic knowledge of 2D boron oxides and may lead to novel 2D

render them promising 2D materials for applications in high-performance

""due to its nonlinear form, it appears difficult to determine whether it is

formed in the bandgap of GeFe; spin-down d(e) band and spin-up p-d(t2) band.
Thus, it is important to clarify how these bands contribute to spin injection

studied within the framework of a simple model based on the factorization
approach. Three-body decays of heavy mesons receive both resonant and
nonresonant contributions. Dominant nonresonant contributions to tree-dominated
and penguin-dominated three-body decays arise from the $b\to u$ tree transition
and $b\to s$ penguin transition, respectively. The former can be evaluated in
the framework of heavy meson chiral perturbation theory with some modification,
while the latter is governed by the matrix element of the scalar density
$\langle M_1M_2|\bar q_1 q_2|0\rangle$. Strong phases in this work reside in
effective Wilson coefficients, propagators of resonances and the matrix element
of scalar density. In order to accommodate the branching fraction and CP
asymmetries observed in $B^-\to K^-\pi^+\pi^-$, the matrix element $\langle
K\pi|\bar sq|0\rangle$ should have an additional strong phase, which might
arise from some sort of power corrections such as final-state interactions. We
calculate inclusive and regional CP asymmetries and find that nonresonant CP
violation is usually much larger than the resonant one and that the
interference effect is generally quite significant. If nonresonant
contributions are turned off in the $K^+K^-K^-$ mode, the predicted CP
asymmetries due to resonances will be wrong in sign when confronted with
experiment. In our study of $B^-\to \pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$, we find that ${\cal
A}_{C\!P}(\rho^0\pi^-)$ should be positive in order to account for CP
asymmetries observed in this decay. However, all theories predict a large and
negative CP violation in $B^-\to \rho^0\pi^-$. Measurements of CP-asymmetry
Dalitz distributions put very stringent constraints on the theoretical models.
We check the magnitude and the sign of violation in some (large) invariant mass
regions to test our model.

suppress such an expansion. Increasing the strength of randomness above the

the metallic nanoparticle arrays. By means of statistics, the mean intensity

crucial importance for applying deep learning algorithms in practice. Recently,
Bayesian optimization has been proposed for optimizing hyperparameters of
various machine learning algorithms. Those methods adopt probabilistic
surrogate models like Gaussian processes to approximate and minimize the
validation error function of hyperparameter values. However, probabilistic
surrogates require accurate estimates of sufficient statistics (e.g.,
covariance) of the error distribution and thus need many function evaluations
with a sizeable number of hyperparameters. This makes them inefficient for
optimizing hyperparameters of deep learning algorithms, which are highly
expensive to evaluate. In this work, we propose a new deterministic and
efficient hyperparameter optimization method that employs radial basis
functions as error surrogates. The proposed mixed integer algorithm, called
HORD, searches the surrogate for the most promising hyperparameter values
through dynamic coordinate search and requires many fewer function evaluations.
HORD does well in low dimensions but it is exceptionally better in higher
dimensions. Extensive evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 for four deep neural
networks demonstrate HORD significantly outperforms the well-established
Bayesian optimization methods such as GP, SMAC, and TPE. For instance, on

and random-permutations cyclic (RPCD), which differs from CCD only in that a

Known convergence guarantees are weaker for CCD and RPCD than for RCD, though

significantly slower than for RCD; a recent paper by \cite{SunY16a} has

sheared horizontal flow (VSHF) co-exists with small scale turbulence. The VSHF
consists of internal gravity waves and the turbulent flow has a kinetic energy
(KE) spectrum that follows an approximate $k^{-3}$ scaling with zero KE flux
and a robust positive enstrophy flux. The spectrum of the turbulent potential
energy (PE) also approximately follows a $k^{-3}$ power-law and its flux is
directed to small scales. For moderate stratification, there is no VSHF and the
KE of the turbulent flow exhibits Bolgiano-Obukhov scaling that transitions
from a shallow $k^{-11/5}$ form at large scales, to a steeper approximate
$k^{-3}$ scaling at small scales. The entire range of scales shows a strong
forward enstrophy flux, and interestingly, large (small) scales show an inverse
(forward) KE flux. The PE flux in this regime is directed to small scales, and
the PE spectrum is characterized by an approximate $k^{-1.64}$ scaling.
Finally, for weak stratification, KE is transferred upscale and its spectrum
closely follows a $k^{-2.5}$ scaling, while PE exhibits a forward transfer and
its spectrum shows an approximate $k^{-1.6}$ power-law. For all stratification
strengths, the total energy always flows from large to small scales and almost
all the spectral indices are well explained by accounting for the scale
dependent nature of the corresponding flux.

the task, this has been the subject of much research. Recently, a new class of
outlier detection algorithms has emerged, called {\it contextual outlier
detection}, and has shown improved performance when studying anomalous behavior
in a specific context. However, as we point out in this article, such
approaches have limited applicability in situations where the context is sparse
(i.e. lacking a suitable frame of reference). Moreover, approaches developed to
date do not scale to large datasets. To address these problems, here we propose
a novel and robust approach alternative to the state-of-the-art called RObust
Contextual Outlier Detection (ROCOD). We utilize a local and global behavioral
model based on the relevant contexts, which is then integrated in a natural and

axes of efficacy and efficiency (40X speedup compared to modern contextual
outlier detection methods). We also drill down and perform a fine-grained

Langlands duality and its higher analogs formulated by
Feigin-Frenkel-Reshetikhin in [3,4]. As an offshoot, we are led to the
sought-after connection between the gauge-theoretic realization of the
geometric Langlands correspondence by Kapustin-Witten [5,6] and its algebraic
CFT formulation by Beilinson-Drinfeld [7], where one can also understand Wilson
and 't Hooft-Hecke line operators in 4d gauge theory as monodromy loop
operators in 2d CFT, for example. In turn, this will allow us to argue that the
higher 5d/6d analog of the geometric Langlands correspondence for simply-laced
Lie (Kac-Moody) groups G (G_k), ought to relate the quantization of circle
(elliptic)-valued G Hitchin systems to circle/elliptic-valued ^LG
(^LG_k)-bundles over a complex curve on one hand, and the transfer matrices of
a G (G_k)-type XXZ/XYZ spin chain on the other, where ^LG is the Langlands dual
of G. Incidentally, the latter relation also serves as an M-theoretic
realization of Nekrasov-Pestun-Shatashvili's recent result in [8], which
relates the moduli space of 5d/6d supersymmetric G (G_k)-quiver SU(K_i) gauge
theories to the representation theory of quantum/elliptic affine (toroidal)

discovered that the spectra are inconsistent with the traditional model

discrepancies are the enhanced O VII and Ne IX forbidden-to-resonance ratios,
and a high O VIII Ly$\beta$ line relative to other Lyman series. A
collisionally ionized absorption model can naturally explain both features,
while a charge exchange component can only account for the former. By including
the additional ionized absorption, the plasma in the North Polar Spur can be
described by a single-phase CIE component with temperature of 0.25 keV, and
nitrogen, oxygen, neon, magnesium, and iron abundances of $0.4-0.8$ solar. The
abundance pattern of the North Polar Spur is well in line with those of the
Galactic halo stars. The high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio reported in previous
studies can be migrated to the large transmission of the O VIII Ly$\alpha$
line. The ionized absorber is characterized by a balance temperature of
$0.17-0.20$ keV and a column density of $3-5 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$. Based
on the derived abundances and absorption, we speculate that the North Polar

important role in shaping the Milky Way bar and bulge as well as its spiral
structure. We use a collisionless N-body simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy
initially composed of a dark matter halo and an exponential disk with Toomre
parameter slightly above unity. In this configuration, dominated by the disk in
the center, a bar forms relatively quickly, after 1 Gyr of evolution. This is
immediately followed by the formation of two manifold-driven spiral arms and
the outflow of stars that modifies the potential in the vicinity of the bar,
apparently shifting the position of the L_1/L_2 Lagrange points. This
modification leads to the shortening of the bar and the creation of a next
generation of manifold-driven spiral arms at a smaller radius. The process
repeats itself a few times over the next 0.5 Gyr resulting in further
substantial weakening and shortening of the bar. The time when the damping
comes to an end coincides with the first buckling episode in the bar which
rebuilds the orbital structure so that no more new spiral arms are formed. The
morphology of the bar and the spiral structure at this time show remarkable
similarity to the present properties of the Milky Way. Later on, the bar starts
to grow rather steadily again, weakened only by subsequent buckling episodes
occurring at more distant parts of the disk.

compute the BWT, that work almost entirely in external memory. On the other
hand, the related problem of computing the Longest Common Prefix (LCP) array is
often instrumental in several algorithms on collection of strings, such as
those that compute the suffix-prefix overlap among strings, which is an

forecasting the behaviour and resource usage of specific applications and in
presenting a status report in a concise manner. AUGURY provides tools for
identifying network traffic congestion and peak usage times, and for making
memory usage projections. The application data processing specialises in two
tasks: the parametrisation of the memory usage of individual applications and
the extraction of the seasonal component from network traffic data. AUGURY uses
a different underlying assumption for each of these two tasks. With respect to
the memory usage, a limited number of single-valued parameters are assumed to
be sufficient to parameterize any application being hosted on the server.
Regarding the network traffic data, long-term patterns, such as hourly or daily
exist and are being induced by work-time schedules and automatised
administrative jobs. In this paper, the implementation of each of the two tasks
is presented, tested using locally-generated data, and applied to data from

demonstrate the insight that AUGURY can add to the monitoring of server and

Rossby number convection of a low magnetic Prandtl number fluid. Here kinematic
dynamo action is investigated with an asymptotic, rapidly rotating dynamo model
for the plane layer geometry that is intrinsically low magnetic Prandtl number.
The thermal Prandtl number and Rayleigh number are varied to illustrate
fundamental changes in flow regime, ranging from laminar cellular convection to
geostrophic turbulence in which an inverse energy cascade is present. A
decrease in the efficiency of the convection to generate a dynamo, as
determined by an increase in the critical magnetic Reynolds number, is observed
as the buoyancy forcing is increased. This decreased efficiency may result from
both the loss of correlations associated with the increasingly disordered
states of flow that are generated, and boundary layer behavior that enhances
magnetic diffusion locally. We find that the spatial characteristics of
$\alpha$, and thus the large-scale magnetic field, is dependent only weakly on
changes in flow behavior. However, our results are limited to the linear,
kinematic dynamo regime, and future simulations including the Lorentz force are
therefore necessary to assess the robustness of this result. In contrast to the
large-scale magnetic field, the behavior of the small-scale magnetic field is
directly dependent on, and therefore shows significant variations with, the
small-scale convective flow field.

endpoint energies. We first point out here that this property does not hold for
certain differential observables that are directly sensitive to the Fierz term,
such as the $\beta$ or the recoil energy spectrum. This observation is relevant
for the selection of sensitive transitions in searches for exotic couplings
through spectrum shape measurements. We then point out previous errors in the
exploitation of measurements of the $\beta-\nu$ angular correlation coefficient
and discuss their impact on the extraction of constraints on exotic couplings.

Imposing the basic constraints required by analyticity, unitarity, and crossing

extract the final-state strong-interaction scattering amplitudes for the
intermediate pi pi->pi pi and pi pi-> K\bar K reactions in a model-independent
fashion. In addition, they provide good fits to the respective gamma gamma-> pi
pi cross-sections that are known in the low-energy sector in the restricted
angular range, | cos theta|< 0.6-0.8. Using the parameters obtained in this
fashion, these authors contruct the \gamma\gamma->pi pi cross-sections
integrated over the full angular range. In this work, we use a version of
chiral perturbation theory developed by Oller and Oset to evaluate the
final-state strong-interaction amplitudes directly theoretically and we compare
our thus obtained low-energy QCD-based results directly with the amplitudes
extracted by Dai and Pennington. We also calculate the gamma gamma -> pi pi
cross-sections (integrated over the full angular range) and compare these with
those obtained by Dai and Pennington. This calculation thus gives a more
detailed insight into the fit of chiral perturbation theory, not just to the

rather to a higher level of detail through the available analysis of the
experimental data for the underlying final-state strong-interaction meson-meson

Modern telescopes routinely use adaptive optics systems to compensate for the
atmosphere and use laser-guide-stars to create artificial stars as bright
references in the field of observation. Because multiple laser-guide-star
adaptive optics are being implemented in all major observatories, we propose to
use man-made stars not only for adaptive optics, but for phasing optics. We
propose a method called the doublet-wavelength coherence technique (DWCT),
exploiting the D lines of sodium in the mesosphere using laser guide-stars. The
signal coherence properties are then used. The DWCT capture range exceeds
current abilities by a factor of 100. It represents a change in paradigm by
improving the phasing optics capture range from micrometric to millimetric. It
thereby potentially eliminates the need of a man-made mechanical pre-phasing
step. Extremely large telescopes require hundreds of segments, several of which
need to be substituted on a daily basis to be recoated. The DWCT relaxes
mechanical integration requirements and speeds up integration and

to cause charge compensation upon Mg doping of GaN. We determine the free
energy of formation of the nitrogen vacancy and of several Mg-related defects.
The entropic contribution as a function of temperature is determined within the
quasiharmonic approximation. We find that the Mg interstitial shows a
noticeably lower free energy of formation than the Mg substitutional to Ga in
p-type conditions. Therefore, the Mg impurity is amphoteric behaving like an
acceptor when substitutional to Ga and like a double donor when accommodated in
an interstitial position. The hybrid-functional results are then linked to
experimental observations by solving the charge neutrality equations for
semiconductor dominated by impurities. We show that a thermodynamic equilibrium
model is unable to account for the experimental hole concentration as a
function of Mg doping density, due to nitrogen vacancies and Mg interstitials
acting as compensating donors. To explain the experimental result, which
includes a dropoff of the hole concentration at high Mg densities, we thus
resort to nonequilibrium models. We show that either nitrogen vacancies or Mg
interstitials could be at the origin of the self-compensation mechanism.
However, only the model based on interstitial Mg donors provides a natural
mechanism to account for the sudden appearance of self-compensation. Indeed,
the amphoteric nature of the Mg impurity leads to Fermi-level pinning and
accounts for the observed dropoff of the hole concentration of GaN samples at
high Mg doping. Our work suggests that current limitations in p-type doping of
GaN could be overcome by extrinsically controlling the Fermi energy during
growth.

gravity. It encodes the gauge invariance of the spin network states of quantum
geometry and provides them with a geometrical interpretation: each decorated
vertex of a spin network is dual to a quantized polyhedron in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.
For instance, a 4-valent vertex is interpreted as a tetrahedron determined by
the four normal vectors of its faces. We develop a framework where the closure
constraint is re-interpreted as a Bianchi identity, with the normals defined as
holonomies around the polyhedron faces of a connection (constructed from the
spinning geometry interpretation of twisted geometries). This allows us to
define closure constraints for hyperbolic tetrahedra (living in the
3-hyperboloid of unit future-oriented spacelike vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$)
in terms of normals living all in $SU(2)$ or in $SB(2,\mathbb{C})$. The latter
fits perfectly with the classical phase space developed for $q$-deformed loop
quantum gravity supposed to account for a non-vanishing cosmological constant
$\Lambda>0$. This is the first step towards interpreting $q$-deformed twisted

of citations of scientific papers and use a combination of the theoretical and
experimental tools to uncover microscopic details of this network growth.
Namely, we develop a stochastic model of citation dynamics based on
copying/redirection/triadic closure mechanism. In a complementary and coherent
way, the model accounts both for statistics of references of scientific papers
and for their citation dynamics. Originating in empirical measurements, the
model is cast in such a way that it can be verified quantitatively in every
aspect. Such verification is performed by measuring citation dynamics of
Physics papers. The measurements revealed nonlinear citation dynamics, the
nonlinearity being intricately related to network topology. The nonlinearity
has far-reaching consequences including non-stationary citation distributions,
diverging citation trajectory of similar papers, runaways or ""immortal papers""
with infinite citation lifetime etc. Thus, our most important finding is
nonlinearity in complex network growth. In a more specific context, our results
can be a basis for quantitative probabilistic prediction of citation dynamics
of individual papers and of the journal impact factor.

planning in a variety of Earth sciences applications. Conditional realizations
can be obtained by first creating unconditional realizations that are then
post-conditioned by kriging. Many efficient algorithms are available for the
first step, so the bottleneck resides in the second step. Instead of doing the
conditional simulations with the desired covariance (F approach) or with a
tapered covariance (T approach), we propose to use the taper covariance only in
the conditioning step (Half-Taper or HT approach). This enables to speed up the
computations and to reduce memory requirements for the conditioning step but
also to keep the right short scale variations in the realizations. A criterion
based on mean square error of the simulation is derived to help anticipate the
similarity of HT to F. Moreover, an index is used to predict the sparsity of
the kriging matrix for the conditioning step. Some guides for the choice of the
taper function are discussed. The distributions of a series of 1D, 2D and 3D

applications in visual surveillance. With the resurgence of Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), several end-to-end deep Siamese CNN architectures have
been proposed for human re-identification with the objective of projecting the

those of dissimilar pairs to be distant from each other. However, current
networks extract fixed representations for each image regardless of other
images which are paired with it and the comparison with other images is done
only at the final level. In this setting, the network is at risk of failing to
extract finer local patterns that may be essential to distinguish positive
pairs from hard negative pairs. In this paper, we propose a gating function to
selectively emphasize such fine common local patterns by comparing the
mid-level features across pairs of images. This produces flexible
representations for the same image according to the images they are paired
with. We conduct experiments on the CUHK03, Market-1501 and VIPeR datasets and

the mean field equations from the saddle point approximation to the generating
functional when the dynamics is defined through a logistic link function, which
is the case for the kinetic Ising model with parallel update. We then spend the
rest of the paper developing two ways of going beyond the saddle point
approximation to the generating functional. In the first one, we develop a
variational perturbative approximation to the generating functional by
expanding the action around a quadratic function of the local fields and
conjugate local fields whose parameters are optimized. We derive analytical
expressions for the optimal parameters and show that when the optimization is
suitably restricted, we recover the mean field equations that are exact for the
fully asymmetric random couplings (M\'ezard and Sakellariou, 2011). However,
without this restriction the results are different. We also describe an
extended Plefka expansion in which in addition to the magnetization, we also
fix the correlation and response functions. Finally, we numerically study the
performance of these approximations for Sherrington-Kirkpatrick type couplings
for various coupling strengths, degrees of coupling symmetry and external
fields. We show that the dynamical equations derived from the extended Plefka
expansion outperform the others in all regimes, although it is computationally
more demanding. The unconstrained variational approach does not perform well in
the small coupling regime, while it approaches dynamical TAP equations of
(Roudi and Hertz, 2011) for strong couplings.

limit, $p_j$. The isotropic and anisotropic depositions for two different
models: of an insulating substrate and conducting $k$-mers (C-model) and of a

Frank-Lobb algorithm was applied to calculate the electrical conductivity in

concentrations ($p=0$ -- $p_j$) of the $k$-mers. The `intrinsic electrical

conductivity $\Sigma (p)$ ($\Sigma=\sigma/ \sigma_m$ for the C-model and
$\Sigma=\sigma_m /\sigma$ for the I-model, where $\sigma_m$ is the electrical
conductivity of substrate) in different directions were analyzed. At large
values of $k$ the $\Sigma (p)$ curves became very similar and they almost
coincided at $k=128$. Moreover, for both models the greater the length of the
$k$-mers the smoother the functions $\Sigma_{xy}(p)$, $\Sigma_{x}(p)$ and
$\Sigma_{y}(p)$. For the C-model, the other interesting findings are: for large

increase rapidly with the initial increase of $p$ from 0 to 0.1; for $k \geq
16$, all the $\Sigma_{xy}(p)$ and $\Sigma_{x}(p)$ curves intersect with each
other at the same iso-conductivity points; for anisotropic deposition, the
percolation concentrations are the same in the $x$ and $y$ directions, whereas,
at the percolation point the greater the length of the $k$-mers the larger the
anisotropy of the electrical conductivity, i.e., the ratio $\sigma_y/\sigma_x$

and strong position disorder. We focus on the problem in a strong magnetic
field when the spin Hamiltonian can be reduced to the effective single-particle
Hamiltonian and treated with conventional numerical technics. It is shown that
in a 3D system with Heisenberg exchange interaction the spin excitations have a
delocalized part of the spectrum even in the limit of strong disorder, thus
leading to the possibility of the coherent spin transport. The spin transport
provided by the delocalized excitations can be described by a diffusion
coefficient. Non-homogenous magnetic fields lead to the Anderson localization
of spin excitations while anisotropy of the exchange interaction results in the
Lifshitz localization of excitations. We discuss the possible effect of the
additional exchange-driven spin diffusion on the organic spin-valve devices.

progressively refines a probability distribution defined on the model structure

aggregate information obtained from the evaluation of the population of models
to reinforce the probability of extracting the most important terms. To reduce

while the coronal structure was previously discussed in Alvarado-G\'omez et al.
(2016). The analysis includes the magneto-hydrodynamical properties of the
stellar wind, the associated mass and angular momentum loss rates, as well as
the topology of the astrospheric current sheet in each system. A systematic
comparison among the considered cases is performed, including two reference
solar simulations covering activity minimum and maximum. For HD 1237, we
investigate the interactions between the structure of the developed stellar
wind, and a possible magnetosphere around the Jupiter-mass planet in this
system. We find that the process of particle injection into the planetary
atmosphere is dominated by the density distribution rather than velocity
profile of the stellar wind. In this context, we predict a maximum exoplanetary
radio emission of 12 mJy at 40 MHz in this system, assuming the crossing of a
high-density streamer during periastron passage. Furthermore, in combination

exhibit commensurability effects between the vortex lattice and the unit cell
of the pinning array. These matching effects yield a slowdown of the vortex
flow and the corresponding dissipation decrease. The superconducting samples
are Nb films grown on Si substrates. We have studied these matching effects
with the array on top, embedded or threading the Nb superconducting films and
using different materials (Si, Cu, Ni, Py dots and dots fabricated with Co/Pd
multilayers). These hybrids allow studying the contribution of different
pinning potentials to the matching effects. The main findings are: i) Periodic
roughness induced in the superconducting film is enough to generate resistivity
minima; ii) A minor effect is achieved by magnetic pinning from periodic
magnetic field potentials obtained by dots with out of plane magnetization
grown on top of the superconducting film, iii) In the case of array of magnetic
dots embedded in the films vortex flow probes the magnetic state; i.e.
magnetoresistance measurements detect the magnetic state of very small
nanomagnets. In addition, we have studied the role played by the local order in
the commensurability effects. This was attained using an array that mimics a
smectic crystal. We have found that preserving the local order is crucial. If
the local order is not retained the magnetoresistance minima vanish.

The star was thought to be solar type, with a temperature of $T_{eff} = (5640
\pm 200)\,$K, $\log(g) = (4.3 \pm 0.3)\,$dex and a rotational period of Prot 22
d (Brown et al. 2011). High resolution spectra turn the target to an evolved
object with Teff = (5300 \pm 150) K, a metalicity of $[m/H] = (-0.5 \pm 0.2)$,
a surface gravity of $log(g) = (3.3 \pm 0.4)\,$dex, and a projected rotational
velocity of $v sin i = (22 \pm 1)\,kms^{-1}$. Within an observing time span of
4 years we detected 150 flares in Kepler data in an energy range of $10^{36} -
10^{37}$ erg. From a dynamical Lomb-Scargle periodogram we have evidence for
differential rotation as well as for stellar spot evolution and migration.
Analysing the occurrence times of the flares we found hints for a periodic
flare frequency cycle of $430 - 460 $d, the significance increases with an
increasing threshold of the flares equivalent duration. One explanation is a
very short activity cycle of the star with that period. Another possibility,
also proposed by others in similar cases, is that the larger flares may be
triggered by external phenomena, such as magnetically interaction with an
unseen companion. Our high resolution spectra show that KIC011764567 is not a
short period binary star.

communication but also in various scientific experiments. The data that is
being received is more and the processing time required has also become more. A
significant change in the algorithms will help to optimize the processing
speed. With the invention of Technologies like IoT and in technologies like
Machine Learning there is a need to compress data. For example training an
Artificial Neural Network requires a lot of data that should be processed and
trained in small interval of time for which compression will be very helpful.
There is a need to process the data faster and quicker. In this paper we
present a method that reduces the data size. This method is known as Optimized
Huffmans Coding. In the Huffmans coding we encode the messages so as to reduce
the data and here in the optimized Huffmans coding we compress the data to a
great extent which helps in various signal processing algorithms and has
advantages in many applications. Here in this paper we have presented the
Optimized Huffmans Coding method for Text compression. This method but has
advantages over the normal Huffmans coding. This algorithm presented here says
that every letter can be grouped together and encoded which not only reduces
the size but also the Huffmans Tree data that is required for decoding, hence
reducing the data size. This method has huge scientific applications.

  Changes",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the spread of wearable devices and head mounted cameras, a wide range of
application requiring precise user localization is now possible. In this paper
we propose to treat the problem of obtaining the user position with respect to
a known environment as a video registration problem. Video registration, i.e.
the task of aligning an input video sequence to a pre-built 3D model, relies on
a matching process of local keypoints extracted on the query sequence to a 3D
point cloud. The overall registration performance is strictly tied to the
actual quality of this 2D-3D matching, and can degrade if environmental
conditions such as steep changes in lighting like the ones between day and
night occur. To effectively register an egocentric video sequence under these
conditions, we propose to tackle the source of the problem: the matching
process. To overcome the shortcomings of standard matching techniques, we
introduce a novel embedding space that allows us to obtain robust matches by
jointly taking into account local descriptors, their spatial arrangement and
their temporal robustness. The proposal is evaluated using unconstrained
egocentric video sequences both in terms of matching quality and resulting
registration performance using different 3D models of historical landmarks. The
results show that the proposed method can outperform state of the art
registration algorithms, in particular when dealing with the challenges of
night and day sequences.

territory where the interplay between collective rotation and single-particle
motion is strongly affected by the neutron continuum. The unbound $fp$-shell
nucleus $ ^{39}\text{Mg} $ is an ideal candidate to study this interplay.
Purpose: In this work, we predict the properties of low-lying resonant states
of $ ^{39}\text{Mg} $, using a suite of realistic theoretical approaches rooted
in the open quantum system framework. Method: To describe the spectrum and
decay modes of $ ^{39}\text{Mg} $ we use the conventional Shell Model, Gamow
Shell Model, Resonating Group Method, Density Matrix Renormalization Group
method, and the non-adiabatic Particle-Plus-Rotor model formulated in the
Berggren basis. Results: The unbound ground state of $ ^{39}\text{Mg} $ is
predicted to be either a $ J^{\pi} = {7/2}^- $ state or a $ {3/2}^- $ state. A
narrow $ J^{\pi} = {7/2}^- $ ground-state candidate exhibits a resonant
structure reminiscent of that of its one-neutron halo neighbor $ ^{37}\text{Mg}
$, which is dominated by the $ f_{7/2} $ partial wave at short distances and a
$ p_{3/2} $ component at large distances. A $ J^{\pi}={3/2}^- $ ground-state
candidate is favored by the large deformation of the system. It can be
associated with the $ {1/2}^- [321] $ Nilsson orbital dominated by the $\ell=1$
wave; hence its predicted width is large. The excited $J^{\pi} = {1/2}^-$ and
$5/2^-$ states are expected to be broad resonances, while the $ J^{\pi} =
{9/2}^- $ and $ {11/2}^- $ members of the ground-state rotational band are
predicted to have very small neutron decay widths. Conclusion: We demonstrate
that the subtle interplay between deformation, shell structure, and continuum
coupling can result in a variety of excitations in an unbound nucleus just
outside the neutron drip line.

into a nonattractive steady state starting from a well developed state for
which the linearization based local approaches will not work. Considering
extended linearizations or state-dependent coefficient representations of
nonlinear systems, we develop sufficient conditions for stability of solution
trajectories. We find that if the coefficient matrix is uniformly stable in a
sufficiently large neighborhood of the current state, then the state will
eventually decay. Based on these analytical results we propose an update scheme
that is designed to maintain the stabilization property of Riccati based

the general applicability of the resulting algorithm for setpoint stabilization

lightcurve. The optical data in the other bands and the X-ray data are well
consistent with the temporal feature of the R band lightcurve. Our joint
spectral fits of the optical and X-ray data show that they are in the same
regime, with a photon index of $\sim 1.70$. The optical and X-ray afterglow
lightcurves are well fitted with the standard external shock model by
considering a delayed energy injection component. Based on our modeling
results, we find that the radiative efficiency of the GRB jet is $\sim 1\%$ and
the magnetization parameter of the afterglow jet is $<0.04$ with the derived
extremely low $\epsilon_B$ (the fraction of shock energy to magnetic field) of
$(1.64\pm 0.25)\times 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the jet may be
matter dominated. Discussion on delayed energy injection from accretion of late

activity with high temporal and good spatial resolution. As the
bioelectromagnetic inverse problem is ill-posed, constraints are required. For
the analysis of evoked brain activity, spatial sparsity of the neuronal
activation is a common assumption. It is often taken into account using convex
constraints based on the l1-norm. The resulting source estimates are however
biased in amplitude and often suboptimal in terms of source selection due to
high correlations in the forward model. In this work, we demonstrate that an
inverse solver based on a block-separable penalty with a Frobenius norm per
block and a l0.5-quasinorm over blocks addresses both of these issues. For
solving the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we propose the iterative
reweighted Mixed Norm Estimate (irMxNE), an optimization scheme based on
iterative reweighted convex surrogate optimization problems, which are solved
efficiently using a block coordinate descent scheme and an active set strategy.
We compare the proposed sparse imaging method to the dSPM and the RAP-MUSIC
approach based on two MEG data sets. We provide empirical evidence based on
simulations and analysis of MEG data that the proposed method improves on the
standard Mixed Norm Estimate (MxNE) in terms of amplitude bias, support
recovery, and stability.

generate binary codes from hand-crafted features, which achieve limited
accuracy since the hand-crafted features cannot optimally represent the image
content and preserve the semantic similarity. Recently, several deep hashing
methods have shown better performance because the deep architectures generate
more discriminative feature representations. However, these deep hashing
methods are mainly designed for supervised scenarios, which only exploit the
semantic similarity information, but ignore the underlying data structures. In
this paper, we propose the semi-supervised deep hashing (SSDH) approach, to
perform more effective hash function learning by simultaneously preserving
semantic similarity and underlying data structures. The main contributions are
as follows: (1) We propose a semi-supervised loss to jointly minimize the
empirical error on labeled data, as well as the embedding error on both labeled

meaningful neighbors on the underlying data structures for effective hashing.
(2) A semi-supervised deep hashing network is designed to extensively exploit
both labeled and unlabeled data, in which we propose an online graph
construction method to benefit from the evolving deep features during training
to better capture semantic neighbors. To the best of our knowledge, the
proposed deep network is the first deep hashing method that can perform hash
code learning and feature learning simultaneously in a semi-supervised fashion.
Experimental results on 5 widely-used datasets show that our proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing methods.

of configurations of priced timed automata between two players, Player Min and
Player Max, by moving a token along the states of the graph to form an infinite
run. The goal of Player Min is to minimize the limit average weight of the run,
while the goal of the Player Max is the opposite. Brenguier, Cassez, and Raskin
recently studied a variation of these games and showed that mean-payoff games
are undecidable for timed automata with five or more clocks. We refine this

a positive side, we show the decidability of mean-payoff games on one-clock

application of dynamic programming based proof techniques applied in the

Generalizing the normal law to manifolds is not canonical and different

reinterpret the Bayesian approach of Lebrun et al. (2013) in terms of minimum

axially-symmetric deformed QRPA based on the finite-range Gogny force. This
approach is applied to even-even nuclei, the strength function for odd nuclei
being derived by interpolation. The convergence with respect to the adopted
number of harmonic oscillator shells and the cut-off energy introduced in the
2-quasiparticle (2-$qp$) excitation space is analyzed. The calculations
performed with two different Gogny interactions, namely D1S and D1M, are
compared. A systematic energy shift of the $E1$ strength is found for D1M
relative to D1S, leading to a lower energy centroid and a smaller
energy-weighted sum rule for D1M. When comparing with experimental
photoabsorption data, the Gogny-QRPA predictions are found to overestimate the
giant dipole energy by typically $\sim$2 MeV. Despite the microscopic nature of
our self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov plus QRPA calculation, some
phenomenological corrections need to be included to take into account the
effects beyond the standard 2-$qp$ QRPA excitations and the coupling between
the single-particle and low-lying collective phonon degrees of freedom. For
this purpose, three prescriptions of folding procedure are considered and
adjusted to reproduce experimental photoabsorption data at best. All of them
are shown to lead to rather similar predictions of the $E1$ strength, both at
low energies and for exotic neutron-rich nuclei. Predictions of $\gamma$-ray

Within this approach expected utilities correspond to families of polynomials.

reveals that PU exhibits heavy-tailed idle times which can be approximated well
with Hyper-exponential distribution (HED). In our work, we deduce the structure
of optimal sensing interval policy for channels with HED OFF times through
Markov Decision Process (MDP). We then use dynamic programming framework to
derive sub-optimal sensing interval policies. A new Multishot sensing interval
policy is proposed and it is compared with existing policies for its
performance in terms of number of channel sensing and interference to PU.

considerations. Therefore, current day numerical algorithms need to be
reexamined as to determine if they are fault resilient, and which critical
operations need to be safeguarded in order to obtain performance that is close
to the ideal fault-free method.
  In a previous paper, a framework for the analysis of random stationary linear
iterations was presented and applied to the two grid method. The present work
is concerned with the multigrid algorithm for the solution of linear systems of
equations, which is widely used on high performance computing systems. It is
shown that the Fault-Prone Multigrid Method is not resilient, unless the
prolongation operation is protected. Strategies for fault detection and
mitigation as well as protection of the prolongation operation are presented
and tested, and a guideline for an optimal choice of parameters is devised.

  Goal: Find a simple and easy to implement solution, predicting performance

  Method: We built several models using four machine learning methods, commonly
used for defect prediction: C4.5 Decision Trees, Na\""{\i}ve Bayes, Bayesian
Networks, and Logistic Regression.
  Results: Our empirical results show that a C4.5 model, using lines of code
changed, file's age and size as explanatory variables, can be used to predict
performance bugs (recall=0.73, accuracy=0.85, and precision=0.96). We show that

maintain the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Mitochondria are the major
sub-cellular organelle of ATP production. With a negative inner membrane
potential, mitochondria take up Ca2+ from their surroundings, a process called
mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Under physiological conditions, Ca2+ uptake into
mitochondria promotes ATP production. Excessive uptake causes mitochondrial
Ca2+ overload, which activates downstream adverse responses leading to cell
dysfunction. Moreover, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake could shape spatio-temporal
patterns of intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Malfunction of mitochondrial Ca2+
uptake is implicated in muscle degeneration. Unlike non-excitable cells,
mitochondria in muscle cells experience dramatic changes of intracellular Ca2+
levels. Besides the sudden elevation of Ca2+ level induced by action
potentials, Ca2+ transients in muscle cells can be as short as a few
milliseconds during a single twitch or as long as minutes during tetanic
contraction, which raises the question whether mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is
fast and big enough to shape intracellular Ca2+ signaling during
excitation-contraction coupling and creates technical challenges for
quantification of the dynamic changes of Ca2+ inside mitochondria. This review
focuses on characterization of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in skeletal muscle and
its role in muscle physiology and diseases.

utilize recent advances in our knowledge of central configurations to assess
the plausibility of linking them to coplanar exoplanetary binary systems. By
simply restricting constituent masses to be within stellar or substellar ranges
characteristic of planetary systems, I find that (i) this constraint reduces by
over 90 per cent the phase space in which central configurations may occur,
(ii) both equal-mass and unequal-mass binary stars admit central
configurations, (iii) these configurations effectively represent different
geometrical extensions of the Sun-Jupiter-Trojan-like architecture, (iv)
deviations from these geometries are no greater than ten degrees, and (v) the
deviation increases as the substellar masses increase. This study may help
restrict future stability analyses to architectures which resemble exoplanetary

consider the case in which a non-adiabatic mode becomes approximately massless

that arises with pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons or moduli. This ultralight mode
freezes on super-horizon scales and acts as a constant source for the curvature

isocurvature component. We identify a Stuckelberg-like emergent shift symmetry
that underlies this behavior. As inflation lasts for many e-folds, the
integrated effect of this source enhances the power spectrum of the adiabatic
mode, while keeping the non-adiabatic spectrum approximately untouched. In this

considered on a square spatial lattice and the fundamental degrees of freedom
are defined on pairs of links from the direct lattice and its dual,
respectively. This provides a natural lattice construction for
topologically-massive gauge theories, which are invariant under parity and
time-reversal symmetry. After defining the building blocks of the doubled
theories, paying special attention to the realization of gauge transformations
on quantum states, we examine the dynamics in the group space of a single
cross, which is spanned by a single link and its dual. The dynamics is governed
by the single-cross electric Hamiltonian and admits a simple quantum mechanical
analogy to the problem of a charged particle moving on a discrete space
affected by an abstract electromagnetic potential. Such a particle might
accumulate a phase shift equivalent to an Aharonov-Bohm phase, which is
manifested in the doubled theory in terms of a nontrivial ground-state
degeneracy on a single cross. We discuss several examples of these doubled
theories with different gauge groups including the cyclic group
$\mathbb{Z}(k)\subset U(1)$, the symmetric group $S_3\subset O(2)$, the binary
dihedral (or quaternion) group $\bar{D}_2\subset SU(2)$, and the finite group
$\Delta(27)\subset SU(3)$. In each case the spectrum of the single-cross
electric Hamiltonian is determined exactly. We examine the nature of the
low-lying excited states in the full Hilbert space, and emphasize the role of
the center symmetry for the confinement of charges. Whether the investigated
doubled models admit a non-Abelian topological state which allows for
fault-tolerant quantum computation will be addressed in a future publication.

elastic solid. The key idea lies in subtracting the rigid body rotation part
from the total deformation. Based on the strain energy equivalence between
classic local model and non-local model, the bond force vector is derived. A
new damage rule of maximal deviatoric bond strain for elastic brittle fracture
is proposed in order to account for both the tensile damage and shear damage.
2D and 3D numerical examples are tested to verify the accuracy of the current
peridynamics. The new damage rule is applied to simulate the propagation of
Mode I, II and III cracks.

UCL, for reasoning about circuits with unreliable gates, are analyzed.
Moreover, two additional problems, motivated by the applications, are studied.
One consists of finding bounds on the reliability rate of the gates that ensure
that a given circuit has an intended success rate. The other consists of
finding a reliability rate of the gates that maximizes the success rate of a
given circuit. Sound and complete algorithms are developed for these problems
and their computational complexity is studied.

thermal conductance of thin films via steady-state IR thermography. The films
are suspended above a hole in an opaque substrate and heated by a homogeneous
visible light source. The temperature distribution of the thin films is
captured via infrared microscopy and fitted to the analytical expression
obtained for the specific hole geometry in order to obtain the in-plane thermal
conductivity. For thin films of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene
sulfonate post-treated with ethylene glycol and of polyimide we find
conductivities of 1.0 W/mK and 0.4 W/mK at room temperature, respectively.
These results are in very good agreement with literature values, validating the
method developed.

  interface motion and microstructural evolution",,,"10.1016/j.jmps.2016.11.008",,"cond-mat.soft math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a unified variational treatment of evolving configurations in
crystalline solids with microstructure. The crux of our treatment lies in the
introduction of a vector configurational field. This field lies in the
material, or configurational, manifold, in contrast with the traditional
displacement field, which we regard as lying in the spatial manifold. We
identify two distinct cases which describe (a) problems in which the
configurational field's evolution is localized to a mathematically sharp
interface, and (b) those in which the configurational field's evolution can
extend throughout the volume. The first case is suitable for describing
incoherent phase interfaces in polycrystalline solids, and the latter is useful
for describing smooth changes in crystal structure and naturally incorporates
coherent (diffuse) phase interfaces. For sharp interfaces that are
out-of-equilibrium, the second law of thermodynamics furnishes restrictions on
the kinetic law for the interface velocity. The class of problems in which the
material undergoes configurational changes between distinct, stable crystal
structures are characterized by free energy density functions that are
non-convex with respect to configurational strain. For physically meaningful
solutions and mathematical well-posedness, it becomes necessary to incorporate
interfacial energy. This we have done by introducing a configurational strain
gradient dependence in the free energy density function following ideas laid
out by Toupin (Arch. Rat. Mech. Anal. 11, 1962, 385-414). The variational
treatment leads to a system of partial differential equations governing the
configuration that is coupled with the traditional equations of nonlinear
elasticity. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate interface motion as
well as evolving microstructures of crystal structures.

theories of gravity, stating that the trajectory of a freely falling test body
is independent of its internal structure and composition. Even though WEP is
known to be valid for the normal matter with a high precision, it has never
been experimentally confirmed for relativistic matter and antimatter. We make
an attempt to constrain possible deviations from WEP utilizing the modern
accelerator technologies. We analyze the (absence of) vacuum Cherenkov
radiation, photon decay, anomalous synchrotron losses and the Compton spectra
to put limits on the isotropic Lorentz violation and further convert them to
the constraints on the difference between the gravitational and inertial masses
of the relativistic electrons/positrons. Our main result is the 0.1% limit on
the mentioned difference.
