  Errors",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Phasor measurement units (PMUs) have the advantage of providing direct
measurements of power states. However, as the number of PMUs in a power system
is limited, the traditional supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system cannot be replaced by the PMU-based system overnight. Therefore, hybrid
power state estimation taking advantage of both systems is important. As
experiments show that sampling phase errors among PMUs are inevitable in
practical deployment, this paper proposes a distributed power state estimation
algorithm under PMU phase errors. The proposed distributed algorithm only
involves local computations and limited information exchange between
neighboring areas, thus alleviating the heavy communication burden compared to
the centralized approach. Simulation results show that the performance of the
proposed algorithm is very close to that of centralized optimal hybrid state
estimates without sampling phase error.

(LOFAR) telescope, and archival data from the Multi-Element Radio Linked
Interferometer Network (MERLIN) and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA).
We model the spatially resolved radio spectrum of Arp 220 from 150 MHz to 33
GHz. We present an image of Arp 220 at 150 MHz with resolution
$0.65''\times0.35''$, sensitivity 0.15 mJy beam$^{-1}$, and integrated flux
density $394\pm59$ mJy. More than 80% of the detected flux comes from extended
($6''\approx$2.2 kpc) steep spectrum ($\alpha=-0.7$) emission, likely from star
formation in the molecular disk surrounding the two nuclei. We find elongated
features extending $0.3''$ (110 pc) and $0.9''$ (330 pc) from the eastern and
western nucleus respectively, which we interpret as evidence for outflows. The
extent of radio emission requires acceleration of cosmic rays far outside the
nuclei. We find that a simple three component model can explain most of the
observed radio spectrum of the galaxy. When accounting for absorption at 1.4
GHz, Arp 220 follows the FIR/radio correlation with $q=2.36$, and we estimate a
star formation rate of 220 M$_\odot\text{yr}^{-1}$. We derive thermal fractions
at 1 GHz of less than 1% for the nuclei, which indicates that a major part of
the UV-photons are absorbed by dust. International LOFAR observations shows
great promise to detect steep spectrum outflows and probe regions of thermal
absorption. However, in LIRGs the emission detected at 150 MHz does not
necessarily come from the main regions of star formation. This implies that
high spatial resolution is crucial for accurate estimates of star formation
rates for such galaxies at 150 MHz.

the foregrounds using a polynomial fit and suppressing the noise by smoothing
the maps over $10^{'} - 30^{'}$ angular scale, the isolated sources at $z \sim

get altered because of the Gaussian smoothing, the images can still be used to

multiple fields for shorter observation times, identify fields with SNR

interaction methods. We find this to be an improvement beyond previous wave
function forms that have been considered. The calculated nonadiabatic
contribution to the energy in the CH molecule is reduced compared to our
previous results, but still remains the largest among the molecules under

were used as a proxy for their stellar masses. Here, a first, global
presentation of the observations and basic results is given, their further
analysis will be presented in other papers in this series. The galaxies were
selected based on their properties, as listed in SDSS DR5. Comparing this
photometry to their total HI masses, we noted that, for a few percent, the SDSS
magnitudes appeared severely misunderestimated, as confirmed by our
re-measurements for selected objects. Although using the later DR9 results
eliminated this problem in most cases, 384 still required manual photometric
source selection. Usable HI spectra were obtained for 2600 galaxies, of which
1733 (67%) were clearly detected and 174 (7%) marginally. The spectra for 241
other observed galaxies could not be used for further analysis owing to
problems with either the HI or the SDSS data. We reached the target number of
about 150 sources per half-magnitude bin over the Mz range -16.5 to -23 mag.
Down to -21 mag the overall detection rate is rather constant at the ~75% level
but it starts to decline steadily towards the 30% level at -23 mag. Making
regression fits by comparing total HI and stellar masses for our sample,
including our conservatively estimated HI upper limits for non-detections, we
find the relationship log(M_HI/M*) = -0.59 log(M*) + 5.05, which lies

iterative updates for a few coordinates (a block) simultaneously throughout the
procedure, have shown remarkable computational performance for solving strongly
convex minimization problems. Typical applications include many popular
statistical machine learning methods such as elastic-net regression, ridge
penalized logistic regression, and sparse additive regression. Existing
optimization literature has shown that for strongly convex minimization, the
CBCD-type methods attain iteration complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(p\log(1/\epsilon))$, where $\epsilon$ is a pre-specified accuracy
of the objective value, and $p$ is the number of blocks. However, such
iteration complexity explicitly depends on $p$, and therefore is at least $p$
times worse than the complexity $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\epsilon))$ of gradient
descent (GD) methods. To bridge this theoretical gap, we propose an improved
convergence analysis for the CBCD-type methods. In particular, we first show
that for a family of quadratic minimization problems, the iteration complexity
$\mathcal{O}(\log^2(p)\cdot\log(1/\epsilon))$ of the CBCD-type methods matches
that of the GD methods in term of dependency on $p$, up to a $\log^2 p$ factor.
Thus our complexity bounds are sharper than the existing bounds by at least a
factor of $p/\log^2(p)$. We also provide a lower bound to confirm that our
improved complexity bounds are tight (up to a $\log^2 (p)$ factor), under the
assumption that the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix do
not scale with $p$. Finally, we generalize our analysis to other strongly
convex minimization problems beyond quadratic ones.

tsunami height time series collected at each buoy from selected source segments
in the Short-term Inundation Forecast for Tsunamis (SIFT) database and involves
a set for 1000 forecasts for each buoy/segment pair at sites just offshore of
selected impact communities. Random error-producing scatter in the time series
is induced by uncertainties in the source location, addition of real oceanic
noise, and imperfect tidal removal. Comparison with an error-free standard
leads to root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) for DART buoys located near a
subduction zone. The RMSEs indicate which buoy provides the best forecast
(lowest RMSE) for sections of the zone, under a warning-time constraint for the
forecasts of 3 hrs. The analysis also shows how the forecasts are degraded
(larger minimum RMSE among the remaining buoys) when one or more buoys become
inoperative. The RMSEs also provide a way to assess array augmentation or
redesign such as moving buoys to more optimal locations. Examples are shown for
buoys off the Aleutian Islands and off the West Coast of South America for

different electronic properties which can in turn be used as ""structural

energies are only ~ 0.1 meV apart. This opens the exciting possibility of
identifying subtle structural features via electronic markers. We show that the
pattern of removal of band degeneracies in different polytypes by the different
forms of symmetry breaking leads to new Rashba ""mini gaps"" with characteristic
Rashba parameters that can be determined from spectroscopy, thereby narrowing
down the physically possible polytypes. By identifying these distinct
DFT-predicted fingerprints via ARPES measurements on LaBiOS2 we found the
dominant polytype with small amounts of mixtures of other polytypes. This
conclusion, consistent with neutron scattering results, establishes ARPES
detection of theoretically established electronic markers as a powerful tool to

Hamiltonian possesses a strong convexity property, then the theory yields
convergence for problems whose optimal state and costate possess two square
integrable derivatives. The convergence theory is based on a stability result
for the sup-norm change in the solution of a variational inequality relative to
a 2-norm perturbation, and on a Sobolev space bound for the error in
interpolation at the Gauss quadrature points and the additional point -1. The
tightness of the convergence theory is examined using a numerical example.

process $B^+\to J/\psi \phi K^+$ using the 3${\rm fb}^{-1}$ data of $p\bar p$
collision at $\sqrt s= 7$ and $8$ TeV. In this paper, we investigate
systematically the properties of hidden charm tetraquark states. The hidden
charm tetraquarks form an octet configuration and a singlet configuration
according to flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry. Based on a diquark-antidiquark model, the
hidden charm tetraquarks spectra are given. The previous XYZ exotic states
altogether with the newly ones $X(4140)$, $X(4274)$, $X(4500)$, and $X(4700)$,
can be well classified into certain representations. The spin-parities and
masses of the XYZ are predicted, most of which are in agreement with the data.
We particularly find that $Z_c(4430)$ may be treated as the first radial
excitation of $Z_c(3900)$, while the $Y(1^{--})$ states can be obtained by the
first orbital excitation of the $X/Z$ states. Besides, we calculate the decay
widths of the hidden charm tetraquarks into two charmed mesons. This work gives
a general tetraquark description for the XYZ states, which is helpful to
uncover their inner structures.

between the number of species represented at least r times and the higher
derivatives of the expected number of species discovered per unit of time.
Combining this relation with a rational function approximation, we propose
nonparametric estimators that are accurate for both large values of r and
long-range extrapolations. We further show that our estimators retain
asymptotic behaviors that are essential for applications on large-scale

by growing the LAO/STO films on different substrates with varying lattice
mismatches to STO. However, this lattice-mismatch-induced strain effect is
static and biaxial, hindering the study of the strain effect in a dynamic way.
In this work we realize dynamic and uniaxial strain to the LAO/STO oxide
heterostructure at low temperature, through mechanical coupling from a
magnetostrictive template. This anisotropic strain results in symmetry breaking
at the interface and induces further splitting of the electronic band structure
and therefore produces different conductivities along the x and y in-plane
directions. In particular, we observe that along the strained direction the
interface conductivity decreases by up to 70% under a tensile strain, while it
increases by 6.8% under a compressive strain at 2 K. Also, it is revealed that
the modulation on the interfacial transport property can be anisotropic, i.e.,
the resistance changes differently when an excitation current is parallel or
perpendicular to the strain direction. This approach of strain engineering
provides another degree of freedom for control of transport properties of oxide
heterostructures and opens an additional way to investigate strain effects in

then directly localize instances of the activity by solving for the

data-mining, both linear (principal component analysis, PCA) and nonlinear
(diffusion maps, DMAPS) to determine good macroscopic variables (observables)

decreasing simulation times of dynamic real-world systems such as
epidemiological network models. Additionally, the data-mining techniques could
be applied to a diverse class of problems to search for a succint,
low-dimensional description of the system in a small number of variables.

modeling equilibrium microstructures of soft materials, particularly for
multiblock polymers. A very successful approach to numerically solving the SCFT
set of equations is based on using a spectral approach. While widely
successful, this approach has limitations especially in the context of current
technologically relevant applications. These limitations include non-trivial
approaches for modeling complex geometries, difficulties in extending to
non-periodic domains, as well as non-trivial extensions for spatial adaptivity.
As a viable alternative to spectral schemes, we develop a finite element
formulation of the SCFT paradigm for calculating equilibrium polymer
morphologies. We discuss the formulation and address implementation challenges
that ensure accuracy and efficiency. We explore higher order chain contour
steppers that are efficiently implemented with Richardson Extrapolation. This
approach is highly scalable and suitable for systems with arbitrary shapes. We
show spatial and temporal convergence and illustrate scaling on up to 2048
cores. Finally, we illustrate confinement effects for selected complex
geometries. This has implications for materials design for nanoscale
applications where dimensions are such that equilibrium morphologies
dramatically differ from the bulk phases.

Even with independent sources, determining the capacity region can be as hard
as the open problem of characterising all information inequalities. The
majority of computable outer bounds in the literature are relaxations of the
Linear Programming bound which involves entropy functions of random variables
related to the sources and link messages. When sources are not independent, the
problem is even more complicated. Extension of Linear Programming bounds to
networks with correlated sources is largely open. Source dependence is usually
specified via a joint probability distribution, and one of the main challenges
in extending linear program bounds is the difficulty (or impossibility) of
characterising arbitrary dependencies via entropy functions. This paper tackles
the problem by answering the question of how well entropy functions can
characterise correlation among sources. We show that by using carefully chosen
auxiliary random variables, the characterisation can be fairly ""accurate"" Using
such auxiliary random variables we also give implicit and explicit outer bounds
on the capacity of networks with correlated sources. The characterisation of
correlation or joint distribution via Shannon entropy functions is also
applicable to other information measures such as Renyi entropy and Tsallis

above the Hoyle state (the second $0^+$ state in 12C). The characters of them
are only poorly discussed in theory and are still mysterious.
  Purpose: I give for the first time a comprehensive understanding of the
structures of the $0^+$ states by analyzing their wave functions, and discuss
relationship with the Hoyle state, similarities, and differences between the
states.
  Method: I extend a microscopic $\alpha$-cluster model called
Tohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-R\""opke (THSR) wave function so as to incorporate
$2\alpha+\alpha$ asymmetric configuration explicitly. The so-called
$r^2$-constraint method to effectively eliminate spurious continuum components
is also used.
  Results: The $0_3^+$ state is shown to have a very large squared overlap with
a single configuration of the extended THSR wave function in an orthogonal
space to the Hoyle state as well as to the ground state. The $0_4^+$ state has
a maximal squared overlap with a single extended THSR wave function with an
extremely prolately-deformed shape.
  Conclusions: The $0_3^+$ state appears as a family of the Hoyle state to have
a higher nodal structure in the internal motions of the $3\alpha$ clusters, due
to the orthogonalization to the Hoyle state. The $0_4^+$ state dominantly has a
linear-chain structure, where the $3\alpha$ clusters move freely in a
non-localized way, like a one-dimensional gas of the $3\alpha$ clusters.

implicitly defined as the locus of points which are weighted means of $k+1$
reference points. As this definition relies on points and not on tangent
vectors, it can also be extended to geodesic spaces which are not Riemannian.
For instance, in stratified spaces, it naturally allows principal subspaces
that span several strata, which is impossible in previous generalizations of
PCA. We show that barycentric subspaces locally define a submanifold of
dimension k which generalizes geodesic subspaces.Second, we rephrase PCA in
Euclidean spaces as an optimization on flags of linear subspaces (a hierarchy
of properly embedded linear subspaces of increasing dimension). We show that
the Euclidean PCA minimizes the Accumulated Unexplained Variances by all the
subspaces of the flag (AUV). Barycentric subspaces are naturally nested,
allowing the construction of hierarchically nested subspaces. Optimizing the
AUV criterion to optimally approximate data points with flags of affine spans
in Riemannian manifolds lead to a particularly appealing generalization of PCA

Tight-binding models for the electrons are coupled to the electromagnetic field
continuum. Our approach differs from the established ones based on
fluctuational electrodynamics, in that it describes truly nonequilibrium steady
states, and is nonlocal in system's dielectric properties. For a two
quantum-dot model a new length scale emerges at which the heat current shows a
peak. This length scale is related to the physics of parallel plate capacitors.
The three-dimensional model results are consistent with the theory of Polder

counts of Spanish national elections that took place in December 2015 and their
sequel in June 2016. Vote counts are extracted at the level of municipalities,
yielding an unusually high resolution dataset with over 8000 samples. We
initially consider the phenomenon of Bipartisanship breakdown by analysing
spatial distributions of several Bipartisanship indices. We find that such
breakdown is more prominent close to cosmopolite and largely populated areas
and less important in rural areas where Bipartisanship still prevails, and its
evolution mildly consolidates in the 2016 round, with some evidence of
Bipartisanship reinforcement which we hypothesize to be due to psychological
mechanisms of risk aversion. On a third step we explore to which extent vote
data are faithful by applying forensic techniques to vote statistics. We first
explore the conformance of first digit distributions to Benford's law for each
of the main political parties. The results and interpretations are mixed and
vary across different levels of aggregation, finding a general good
quantitative agreement at the national scale for both municipalities and
precincts but finding systematic nonconformance at the level of individual
precincts. As a complementary metric, we further explore the co-occurring
statistics of voteshare and turnout, finding a mild tendency in the clusters of
the conservative party to smear out towards the area of high turnout and
voteshare, what has been previously interpreted as a possible sign of
incremental fraud. In every case results are qualitatively similar between 2015
and 2016 elections.

the locally polyhedral assumption is removed. In that case, the convergence

non-relativistic Schr\""{o}dinger equation and regard it as an ensemble mean
representation of the stochastic motion of a single particle in a vacuum,
subject to an undefined stochastic quantum force. By analyzing the Bohm
potential it is found that the imaginary part of the quantum momentum is the
root mean square fluctuation of the particle around its mean velocity, where
the latter is the real part of the quantum momentum. The local mean of the
quantum force is found to be proportional to the third spatial derivative of
the probability density function, and its associated pressure to the second
spatial derivative. The latter is decomposed from the single particle diluted
gas pressure, and this pressure partition allows the interpretation of the
quantum Bohm potential as the energy required to put a particle in a bath of
fluctuating vacuum at constant entropy and volume.
  The stochastic force expectation value is zero and is uncorrelated with the
particle location, thus does not perform work on average. Nonetheless it is
anti-correlated with volume and this anti-correlation leads to a new type of an
Heisenberg like relation. We imply the dynamic Gaussian solution to the
Schr\""{o}dinger equation as a simple example for exploring the mean properties
of this quantum force. Still an interesting remained open task is the

especially when detecting duplicates and linking cites properly must be pointed
out. The fact of managing with highly cited papers, however, minimizes the

concludes that Google Scholar data offer an original and different vision of

well-known strategic information transmission problems in economics. The
mathematical model involves information transmission between two agents, a
sender who observes two Gaussian processes, state and bias, and a receiver who
takes an action based on the received message from the sender. The players
incur quadratic instantaneous costs as functions of the state, bias and action
variables. Our particular focus is on the Stackelberg equilibrium, which
corresponds to information disclosure and Bayesian persuasion problems in
economics. Prior work solved the static game, and showed that the Stackelberg
equilibrium is achieved by pure strategies that are linear functions of the
state and the bias variables. The main focus of this work is on the dynamic
(multi-stage) setting, where we show that the existence of a pure strategy
Stackelberg equilibrium, within the set of linear strategies, depends on the
problem parameters. Surprisingly, for most problem parameters, a pure linear
strategy does not achieve the Stackelberg equilibrium which implies the
existence of a trade-off between exploiting and revealing information, which
was also encountered in several other asymmetric information games.

filling-in at the blind spot. On the other hand, vertical preference is
exhibited in the case of tolerance in filling-in. What causes this anisotropy
in our perception? Building upon the general notion, that the functional
properties of the early visual system are shaped by the innate specification as
well as the statistics of the environment, we reasoned that the anisotropy in
filling-in could be understood in terms of anisotropy in orientation
distribution inherent to natural scene statistics. We examined this proposition
by investigating filling-in of bar stimuli on a Hierarchical Predictive Coding
model network. In response to bar stimuli, the model network, trained with
natural images, exhibited anisotropic filling-in performance at the blind spot
similar to reported in psychophysical experiments i.e. horizontal preference in
filling-in and vertical preference in tolerance of filling-in. We suggest that
the over-representation of horizontal contours in the natural scene contribute
to the observed horizontal superiority while the broader distribution of
vertical contours contributes to the observed vertical superiority in
tolerance. These results indicate that natural scene statistics plays a
significant role in determining the filling-in performance at the blind spot
and shaping the associated anisotropies.

oscillation (QPO) in their X-ray flux, and an iron emission line in their X-ray
spectrum. The iron line is generated through continuum photons reflecting off
the accretion disk, and its shape is distorted by relativistic motion of the
orbiting plasma and the gravitational pull of the black hole. The physical
origin of the QPO has long been debated, but is often attributed to
Lense-Thirring precession, a General Relativistic effect causing the inner flow
to precess as the spinning black hole twists up the surrounding space-time.
This predicts a characteristic rocking of the iron line between red and blue
shift as the receding and approaching sides of the disk are respectively
illuminated. Here we report on XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of the black
hole binary H 1743-322 in which the line energy varies systematically over the
~4 s QPO cycle (3.70 sigma significance), as predicted. This provides strong
evidence that the QPO is produced by Lense-Thirring precession, constituting
the first detection of this effect in the strong gravitation regime. There are
however elements of our results harder to explain, with one section of data
behaving differently to all the others. Our result enables the future
application of tomographic techniques to map the inner regions of black hole
accretion disks.

incorporate an observer-independent length scale in special theory of
relativity. The Magueijo-Smolin proposal of DSR is realizable through a
particular form of the noncommutative (NC) spacetime (known as
$\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime) in which the Lorentz symmetry is preserved. In
this framework, the NC parameter $\kappa$ provides the origin of natural cutoff
energy scale. Using a nonlinear deformed relativistic dispersion relation along
with the Lorentz transformations, we investigate some phenomenological facets
of two-body collision problem (without creation of new particles) in a
$\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime. By treating an elastic scattering problem, we
study effects of the Planck scale energy cutoff on some relativistic
kinematical properties of this scattering problem. The results are challenging
in the sense that as soon as one turns on the $\kappa$-spacetime extension, the
nature of the two-body collision alters from elastic to inelastic one. It is
shown also that a significant kinematical variable involving in heavy ion
collisions, the rapidity, is not essentially an additive quantity under a
sequence of the nonlinear representation of the Lorentz transformations.

phenomena to occur. Our study includes integrable models like Ising and XY
models in $d=1$ and Kitaev model in $d=1$ and $2$ and can also be extended to
Dirac fermions in graphene. We witness the wave-function overlap or dynamic
freezing to occur within some small/ intermediate frequency regimes in the
$(\omega_1 ,r)$ plane (with $r\ne0$) when the ground state is evolved through
single cycle of driving. However, evolved states soon become steady with long
driving and the freezing scenario gets rarer. We extend the formalism of
adiabatic-impulse approximation for many cycle driving within our two-rate
protocol and show the near-exact comparisons at small frequencies. An extension
of the rotating wave approximation is also developed to gather an analytical
framework of the dynamics at high frequencies. Finally we compute the
entanglement entropy in the stroboscopically evolved states within the gapped
phases of the system and observe how it gets tuned with the ratio $r$ in our
protocol. The minimally entangled states are found to fall within the regime of
dynamical freezing. In general, the results indicate that the entanglement
entropy in our driven short-ranged integrable systems follow genuine non-area
law of scaling and show a convergence (with a $r$ dependent pace) towards
volume scaling behavior as the driving is continued for long time.

rather than statistical errors. In the case of weak lensing, galaxy shapes must
be measured to extraordinary accuracy (shear systematics of $< 0.01\%$) in
order to achieve good constraints on dark energy parameters. By using shape
information from overlapping surveys in optical and radio bands, robustness to

(ULX) X-6 in the nearby galaxy NGC 4258 (M106) based on the archival {\it
XMM-Newton}, {\it Chandra}, {\it Swift}, and {\it Hubble Space Telescope} ({\it
HST}) observations. The source has a peak luminosity of $L_{\mathrm{X}} \sim 2
\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the {\it XMM-Newton} observation of 2004 June.
Consideration of the hardness ratios and spectral model parameters shows that
the source seems to exhibit possible spectral variations throughout the X-ray
observations. In the images from the {\it HST}/Advanced Camera for Surveys
(ACS), three optical sources have been identified as counterpart candidates
within the 1$\sigma$ error radius of 0$\arcsec$.3. The brightest one has an
absolute magnitude of $M_{V} \approx$ $-$7.0 and shows extended structure. The
remaining two sources have absolute magnitudes of $M_{V} \approx$ $-$5.8 and
$-$5.3 mag. The possible spectral types of the candidates from brightest to
dimmest were determined as B6$-$A5, B0$-$A7, and B2$-$A3, respectively. The
counterparts of the X-ray source possibly belong to a young star cluster.
Neither the standard disk model nor the slim disk model provides firm evidence
to determine the spectral characteristics of ULX X-6. We argue that the mass of
the compact object lies in the range $10-15M_{\sun}$ indicating that the
compact source is most likely a stellar-mass black hole.

structure, e.g. repeated observations within subjects in a longitudinal design,
patients nested within centers in a multicenter design. However, recently, due
to the medical advances, the number of fixed effect covariates collected from
each patient can be quite large, e.g. data on gene expressions of each patient,
and all of these variables are not necessarily important for the outcome. So,
it is very important to choose the relevant covariates correctly for obtaining
the optimal inference for the overall study. On the other hand, the relevant
random effects will often be low-dimensional and pre-specified. In this paper,
we consider regularized selection of important fixed effect variables in linear
mixed-effects models along with maximum penalized likelihood estimation of both
fixed and random effect parameters based on general non-concave penalties.
Asymptotic and variable selection consistency with oracle properties are proved
for low-dimensional cases as well as for high-dimensionality of non-polynomial
order of sample size (number of parameters is much larger than sample size). We
also provide a suitable computationally efficient algorithm for implementation.
Additionally, all the theoretical results are proved for a general non-convex
optimization problem that applies to several important situations well beyond
the mixed model set-up (like finite mixture of regressions etc.) illustrating
the huge range of applicability of our proposal.

the morphology of star-forming galaxies is generally dictated by the youngest
stellar component, which can readily overshine faint structural/morphological
features in the older underlying stellar background (e.g., relics from recent
minor mergers) that could hold important insights into the galaxy build-up
process. Stripping off galaxy images from the emission from stellar populations
younger than an adjustable age cutoff tcut can, therefore, provide a valuable
tool in extragalactic research. RemoveYoung (RY), a publicly available tool
that is presented here, exploits the combined power of integral field
spectroscopy (IFS) and spectral population synthesis (SPS) toward this goal.
Two-dimensional (2D) post-processing of SPS models to IFS data cubes with RY
permits computation of the spectral energy, surface brightness, and stellar
surface density distribution of stellar populations older than a user-defined
tcut. This suggests a variety of applications of star-forming galaxies, such as
interacting or merging galaxy pairs and lower mass starburst galaxies near and

electric field does not affect the total multiplicities of both $\pi^{-}$ and
$\pi^{+}$ mesons at both the lower beam energy of 400MeV/nucleon and the higher
beam energy of 1500MeV/nucleon, it reduces (enhances) the emission of $\pi^{-}$

$\pi^{-}$ ($\pi^{+}$) mesons in forward and backward rapidities especially for
the more peripheral collisions at the lower beam energy because of the rapidly
transient variable magnetic field at more peripheral collisions and longer
reaction duration time at the lower beam energy. These findings indicate that
the total \pi^{-}/\pi^{+} ratio is still a precisely reliable probe of symmetry
energy at both the lower and higher beam energies, but one should consider the
induced electric field when using the differential \pi^{-}/\pi^{+} ratio to
probe the symmetry energy especially for the lower beam energy and more

ratio of \pi^{-}/\pi^{+} in different rapidities is proposed to be an effective
probe of the induced electric field generated in heavy-ion collisions due to
its maximizing effects of induced electric fields on the differential

in the fitness of all microorganisms, and its dependence on size may reveal
clues to the origins of evolutionary transitions to multicellularity. Because
potential benefits in uptake rates must be viewed in the context of other costs
and benefits of size, such as varying predation rates and the increased
metabolic costs associated with larger and more complex body plans, the uptake
rate itself is not necessarily that which is optimized by evolution. Uptake
rates can be strongly dependent on local organism geometry and its swimming
speed, providing selective pressure for particular arrangements. Here we
examine these issues for choanoflagellates, filter-feeding microorganisms that
are the closest relatives of the animals. We explore the different
morphological variations of the choanoflagellete $Salpingoeca~rosetta$, which
can exist as a swimming cell, a sessile thecate cell, and as colonies of cells
in various shapes. In the absence of other requirements and in a homogeneously

feeding by the collar of microvilli is to swim fast, which favours swimming
unicells. In large external flows, the sessile thecate cell becomes
advantageous. Effects of prey diffusion are discussed and also found to be to
the advantage of the swimming unicell.

reactions induced by $^{129}Xe$ projectiles on $^{nat}Sn$ targets for energies
ranging from $8$ A.MeV to $35$ A.MeV were measured with the INDRA
$4\pi$-array.\\ The evaluation of the fusion/incomplete fusion cross sections

\item[Method] The reaction cross sections are evaluated for each beam energy

study on a selected sample of events, in such a way that the fusion/fusion
incomplete cross section is estimated. \item[Results] The excitation function

  \item[Conclusions] The fusion-like cross-sections evaluated show a good
agrement with a recent systematics for beam energies greater than 20 A.MeV. For
low beam energies the cross-section values are lower than the expected ones. A
probable reason for these low values is in the fusion hindrance at energies

  Flux-flow, Doppler shift and quasiparticle pockets",,,,,"cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are several ways to turn a superconductor into a normal conductor:
increase the temperature, apply a high magnetic field, or run a large current.
High-T$_c$ cuprate superconductors are unusual in the sense that experiments
suggest that destroying superconductivity by heating the sample to temperatures
above T$_c$ or by applying a high magnetic field result in different 'normal'
states. Spectroscopic probes show that above T$_c$, in the pseudogap regime,
the Fermi surface is partly gapped and there are no well-defined
quasiparticles. Transport measurements, on the contrary, reveal quantum
oscillations in high magnetic fields and at low temperatures, suggesting a more
usual Fermi liquid state. Studying the electronic structure while suppressing
superconductivity by using current, will hopefully shed new light on this
problem. In type II superconductors, such as the cuprates, the resistive state
created by the current is a result of vortex motion. The large dissipation in
the flux-flow regime makes spectroscopic measurements in the presence of
current challenging. We performed angle-resolved photoemission experiments in
thin films of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_y$ while running high-density current
through the samples. Clear evidence was found for non-uniform flux flow,
leaving most of the sample volume free of mobile vortices and dissipation. The
super-current changes the electronic spectrum, creating quasiparticle and
quasihole pockets. The size of these pockets as a function of the current is
found to be doping dependent; it depends both on the superfluid stiffness and
on the strength of interactions.

excited through a subcritical dynamo process involving the magnetorotational
instability (MRI). High-resolution simulations exhibit a tendency towards
statistical self-organization of MRI dynamo turbulence into large-scale cyclic
dynamics. Understanding the physical origin of these structures, and whether
they can be sustained and transport angular momentum efficiently in
astrophysical conditions, represents a significant theoretical challenge. The
discovery of simple periodic nonlinear MRI dynamo solutions has recently proven
useful in this respect, and has notably served to highlight the role of
turbulent magnetic diffusion in the seeming decay of the dynamics at low
magnetic Prandtl number Pm (magnetic diffusivity larger than viscosity), a
common regime in accretion disks. The connection between these simple
structures and the statistical organization reported in turbulent simulations
remained elusive, though. Here, we report the numerical discovery in moderate
aspect ratio Keplerian shearing boxes of new periodic, incompressible,
three-dimensional nonlinear MRI dynamo solutions with a larger dynamical
complexity reminiscent of such simulations. These ""chimera"" cycles are
characterized by multiple MRI-unstable dynamical stages, but their basic
physical principles of self-sustainment are nevertheless identical to those of
simpler cycles found in azimuthally elongated boxes. In particular, we find
that they are not sustained at low Pm either due to subcritical turbulent
magnetic diffusion. These solutions offer a new perspective into the transition
from laminar to turbulent instability-driven dynamos, and may prove useful to
devise improved statistical models of turbulent accretion disk dynamos.

studied. One of the most important theories for the MDL principle is Barron and
Cover's theory (BC theory), which gives a mathematical justification of the MDL
principle. The original BC theory, however, can be applied to supervised
learning only approximately and limitedly. Though Barron et al. recently
succeeded in removing a similar approximation in case of unsupervised learning,
their idea cannot be essentially applied to supervised learning in general. To
overcome this issue, an extension of BC theory to supervised learning is
proposed. The derived risk bound has several advantages inherited from the
original BC theory. First, the risk bound holds for finite sample size. Second,
it requires remarkably few assumptions. Third, the risk bound has a form of
redundancy of the two-stage code for the MDL procedure. Hence, the proposed
extension gives a mathematical justification of the MDL principle to supervised
learning like the original BC theory. As an important example of application,
new risk and (probabilistic) regret bounds of lasso with random design are
derived. The derived risk bound holds for any finite sample size $n$ and
feature number $p$ even if $n\ll p$ without boundedness of features in contrast
to the past work. Behavior of the regret bound is investigated by numerical
simulations. We believe that this is the first extension of BC theory to
general supervised learning with random design without approximation.

  A tagged probe interval graph (briefly, TPIG) is motivated by similar
applications to genomics, where the set of vertices is partitioned into two
sets, namely, probes and nonprobes and there is an interval on the real line
corresponding to each vertex. The graph has an edge between two probe vertices
if their corresponding intervals intersect, has an edge between a probe vertex
and a nonprobe vertex if the interval corresponding to a nonprobe vertex
contains at least one end point of the interval corresponding to a probe vertex
and the set of non-probe vertices is an independent set. This class of graphs
have been defined nearly two decades ago, but till today there is no known

proper tagged probe interval graphs (in short PTPIG). We present
characterization and a linear time recognition algorithm for PTPIG. To obtain

objects are modeled not just in terms of interfaces but also in terms of their
usage protocols, describing legal sequences of method calls, possibly depending
on the object's internal state. We argue that the Actor Model allows
typestate-OOP in an inherently distributed setting, whereby objects/actors can
be accessed concurrently by several processes, and local entities cooperate to
carry out a communication protocol. In this article we illustrate the approach
by means of a number of examples written in Scala Akka. We show that Scala's
abstractions support clean and natural typestate-oriented actor programming
with the usual asynchronous and non-blocking semantics. We also show that the
standard type system of Scala and a typed wrapping of usual (untyped) Akka's
ActorRef are enough to provide rich forms of type safety so that well-typed
actors respect their intended communication protocols. This approach draws on a
solid theoretical background, consisting of a sound behavioral type system for
the Join Calculus, that is a foundational calculus of distributed asynchronous

unveiled its strong connections with typestate-oriented programming of both

beam is kicked, its trajectory changes while the orientation of the
microbunching wavefront remains as before. Experiments at the LCLS showed that
radiation in the kicked direction is produced practically without suppression.
This could be explained if the orientation of the microbunching wavefront is
readjusted along the kicked direction. In previous papers we showed that when
the evolution of the electron beam modulation is treated according to
relativistic kinematics, the orientation of the microbunching wavefront in the
ultrarelativistic asymptotic is always perpendicular to the electron beam
velocity. There we refrained from using advanced theoretical concepts to
explain or analyze the wavefront rotation. For example, we only hinted to the
relation of this phenomenon with the concept of Wigner rotation. This more
abstract view of wavefront rotation underlines its elementary nature. The
Wigner rotation is known as a fundamental effect in elementary particle
physics. The composition of non collinear boosts does not result in a simple
boost but, rather, in a Lorentz transformation involving a boost and a
rotation, the Wigner rotation. Here we show that during the LCLS experiments, a
Wigner rotation was actually directly recorded for the first time with a
ultrarelativistic, macroscopic object: an ultrarelativistic electron bunch in
an XFEL modulated at nm-scale of the size of about 10 microns. Here we point
out the role of Wigner rotation in the analysis and interpretation of
experiments with ultrarelativistic, microbunched electron beams in FELs. After
the beam splitting experiment at the LCLS it became clear that, in the
ultrarelativistic asymptotic, the projection of the microbunching wave vector
onto the beam velocity is a Lorentz invariant, similar to the helicity in
particle physics.

solutions are obtained by applying an isotropic regularization procedure to
distributional expressions of the elastodynamic fields built on the Green
tensor of the Navier equation. The obtained regularized field expressions are
singularity-free, and depend on the dislocation density rather than on the
plastic eigenstrain. They cover non-uniform motion at arbitrary speeds,
including faster-than-wave ones. A numerical method of computation is
discussed, that rests on discretizing motion along an arbitrary path in the
plane transverse to the dislocation, into a succession of time intervals of
constant velocity vector over which time-integrated contributions can be
obtained in closed form. As a simple illustration, it is applied to the
elastodynamic equivalent of the Tamm problem, where fields induced by a
dislocation accelerated from rest beyond the longitudinal wave speed, and
thereafter put to rest again, are computed. As expected, the proposed
expressions produce Mach cones, the dynamic build-up and decay of which is

usual form, two players take turns to play moves in a set (`the board'), and
certain subsets are designated as `winning': the first person to occupy such a
set wins the game. For these games, it is well known that (with correct play)
the game cannot be a second-player win.
  In the avoidance (or mis\`{e}re) form, the first person to occupy such a set
\emph{loses} the game. Here it would be natural to expect that the game cannot
be a first-player win, at least if the game is transitive, meaning that all
points of the board look the same. Our main result is that, contrary to this
expectation, there are transitive games that are first-player wins, for all
board sizes which are not prime or a power of 2.
  Further, we show that such games can have additional properties such as
stronger transitivity conditions, fast winning times, and `small' winning sets.

angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to identify an orbital-dependent

  Computation, Elsevier)",,,,"cs.DC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider networks of processes which interact with beeps. In the basic
model defined by Cornejo and Kuhn (2010), processes can choose in each round
either to beep or to listen. Those who beep are unable to detect simultaneous
beeps. Those who listen can only distinguish between silence and the presence
of at least one beep. We refer to this model as $BL$ (beep or listen). Stronger
models exist where the nodes can detect collision while they are beeping
($B_{cd}L$), listening ($BL_{cd}$), or both ($B_{cd}L_{cd}$). Beeping models
are weak in essence and even simple tasks are difficult or unfeasible within.
  We present a set of generic building blocks (design patterns) which seem to
occur frequently in the design of beeping algorithms. They include multi-slot
phases: the fact of dividing the main loop into a number of specialised slots;
exclusive beeps: having a single node beep at a time in a neighbourhood (within
one or two hops); adaptive probability: increasing or decreasing the
probability of beeping to produce more exclusive beeps; internal (resp.
peripheral) collision detection: for detecting collision while beeping (resp.
listening). Based on these patterns, we provide algorithms for a number of
basic problems, including colouring, 2-hop colouring, degree computation, 2-hop
MIS, and collision detection (in $BL$). The patterns make it possible to
formulate these algorithms in a rather concise and elegant way. Their analyses
are more technical; one of them improves significantly upon that of the best
known MIS algorithm by Jeavons et al. (2016). Finally, inspired by a technique
from Afek et al. (2013), our last contribution is to show that any Las Vegas
algorithm relying on collision detection can be transposed into a Monte Carlo
algorithm without collision detection at the cost of a logarithmic slowdown,
which we prove is optimal.

The distributions of these times are heavy tailed and often described by a

interesting graph problems expressed as linear systems. One field where
Laplacian linear systems play a role is network analysis, e. g. for certain

network. One such centrality measure is current-flow closeness. To allow
network analysis workflows to profit from a fast Laplacian solver, we provide
an implementation of the LAMG multigrid solver in the NetworKit package,
facilitating the computation of current-flow closeness values or related

the current-flow computation for one node or a reasonably small node subset
significantly. One sampling-based algorithm provides an unbiased estimation of
the related electrical farness, the other one is based on the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform. Our inexact algorithms lead to very accurate
results in practice. Thanks to them one is now able to compute an estimation of
current-flow closeness of one node on networks with tens of millions of nodes
and edges within seconds or a few minutes. From a network analytical point of
view, our experiments indicate that current-flow closeness can discriminate
among different nodes significantly better than traditional shortest-path
closeness and is also considerably more resistant to noise -- we thus show that
two known drawbacks of shortest-path closeness are alleviated by the
current-flow variant.

It is common to fit conventional statistical models by vectorizing

reliable analysis results. To overcome the problem of high-dimensionality in
hypothesis testing, variance component test has been proposed with promise
detection power, but is not straightforward to provide estimates of effect

the inherent structure of the matrix-covariate. The advantage is that
estimation and hypothesis testing can be conducted simultaneously as in the
conventional case, while the estimation efficiency and detection power can be
largely improved, due to a parsimonious parameterization for the coefficients
of matrix-covariate. Our method is applied to test the significance of
gene-gene interactions in the PSQI data, and is applied to test if

in the GAMA equatorial fields (around 160 sq. deg.), using ultraviolet (UV)
photometry from GALEX, far-infrared (FIR) and sub-millimetre (sub-mm)
photometry from H-ATLAS, and Halpha spectroscopy from the GAMA survey. With a
high-quality sample of 745 galaxies (median redshift 0.08), we consider three
SFR tracers: UV luminosity corrected for dust attenuation using the UV spectral
slope beta (SFRUV,corr), Halpha line luminosity corrected for dust using the
Balmer decrement (BD) (SFRHalpha,corr), and the combination of UV and IR
emission (SFRUV+IR). We demonstrate that SFRUV,corr can be reconciled with the
other two tracers after applying attenuation corrections by calibrating IRX
(i.e. the IR to UV luminosity ratio) and attenuation in the Halpha (derived
from BD) against beta. However, beta on its own is very unlikely to be a
reliable attenuation indicator. We find that attenuation correction factors
depend on parameters such as stellar mass, z and dust temperature (Tdust), but
not on Halpha equivalent width (EW) or Sersic index. Due to the large scatter
in the IRX vs beta correlation, when compared to SFRUV+IR, the beta-corrected
SFRUV,corr exhibits systematic deviations as a function of IRX, BD and Tdust.

  Methods. We developed a modified stacking method to reconstruct the 250
micron LF using optically selected galaxies from the SDSS survey and Herschel
maps of the GAMA equatorial fields and Stripe 82. Our stacking method not only
recovers the mean 250 micron luminosities of galaxies that are too faint to be

  Results. We find very good agreement with previous measurements in the
overlapping luminosity range. More importantly, we are able to derive the LF
down to much fainter luminosities (around 25 times fainter) than achieved by
previous studies. We find strong positive luminosity evolution \propto (1 +

two-prover game $\mathcal{G}$ is a game in which the two provers are sent
random sets of questions from $\mathcal{G}$ of sizes $k$ and $l$ respectively.
These two sets are sampled independently uniformly among all sets of questions
of those particular sizes. We prove the following birthday repetition theorem:
when $\mathcal{G}$ satisfies some mild conditions, $val(\mathcal{G}^{k \times
l})$ decreases exponentially in $\Omega(kl/n)$ where $n$ is the total number of
questions. Our result positively resolves an open question posted by Aaronson,
Impagliazzo and Moshkovitz (CCC 2014).
  As an application of our birthday repetition theorem, we obtain new
fine-grained hardness of approximation results for dense CSPs. Specifically, we
establish a tight trade-off between running time and approximation ratio for
dense CSPs by showing conditional lower bounds, integrality gaps and
approximation algorithms. In particular, for any sufficiently large $i$ and for
every $k \geq 2$, we show the following results:
  - We exhibit an $O(q^{1/i})$-approximation algorithm for dense Max $k$-CSPs
with alphabet size $q$ via $O_k(i)$-level of Sherali-Adams relaxation.
  - Through our birthday repetition theorem, we obtain an integrality gap of
$q^{1/i}$ for $\tilde\Omega_k(i)$-level Lasserre relaxation for fully-dense Max
$k$-CSP.
  - Assuming that there is a constant $\epsilon > 0$ such that Max 3SAT cannot
be approximated to within $(1-\epsilon)$ of the optimal in sub-exponential
time, our birthday repetition theorem implies that any algorithm that
approximates fully-dense Max $k$-CSP to within a $q^{1/i}$ factor takes
$(nq)^{\tilde \Omega_k(i)}$ time, almost tightly matching the algorithmic
result based on Sherali-Adams relaxation.

newest developments in passive linear optics that have resulted, directly or
indirectly, from the somewhat shocking discovery in 2010 that the BosonSampling
problem is likely hard for a classical computer to simulate. In doing so, I
hope to provide a historic context for the original result, as well as an
outlook on the future of technology derived from these newer developments. An
emphasis is made in each section to provide a broader conceptual framework for
understanding the consequences of each result in light of the others. This
framework is intended to be comprehensible even without a deep understanding of
the topics themselves.
  The first three chapters focus more closely on the BosonSampling result
itself, seeking to understand the computational complexity aspects of passive
linear optical networks, and what consequences this may have. Some effort is
spent discussing a number of issues inherent in the BosonSampling problem that
limit the scope of its applicability, and that are still active topics of
research. Finally, we describe two other linear optical settings that inherit
the same complexity as BosonSampling. The final chapters focus on how an
intuitive understanding of BosonSampling has led to developments in optical
metrology and other closely related fields. These developments suggest the
exciting possibility that quantum sensors may be viable in the next few years
with only marginal improvements in technology. Lastly, some open problems are
presented which are intended to lay out a course for future research that would
allow for a more complete picture of the scalability of the architecture
developed in these chapters.

analytically the distribution of the eigenvalues of $\rho_A^{T_2}$, that we dub

described by a Conformal Field Theory (CFT), focusing on the case of two
adjacent intervals. We show that the negativity spectrum is universal and
depends only on the central charge of the CFT, similarly to the entanglement
spectrum. The precise form of the negativity spectrum depends on whether the
two intervals are in a pure or mixed state, and in both cases, a dependence on
the sign of the eigenvalues is found. This dependence is weak for bulk
eigenvalues, whereas it is strong at the spectrum edges. We also investigate
the scaling of the smallest (negative) and largest (positive) eigenvalues of
$\rho_A^{T_2}$. We check our results against DMRG simulations for the critical

variations of the cross-sectional area along the flux tubes supporting

different geometrical parameters on the oscillation properties. We found that

solid-liquid interfaces, but have a limitation due to the interfacial thermal
resistance. Vibrational mismatch at the interface leads to this interfacial
thermal resistance, which plays an important role in energy transfer at the
boundary. Negligible work has been reported on the influence of CNT diameter on
the resistance through the vibrational mismatch study. Molecular dynamics
simulations have been performed to investigate the effect of CNT diameter on
interfacial resistance between carbon nanotube (CNT) and water molecules. This
work is an effort to understand the heat transfer phenomenon at the interface
by quantifying the vibrational mismatch. Analysis of the vibrational spectra of
CNT and water molecules is done to study the effect of CNT diameter on
interfacial resistance. Starting with the initial configuration, and
equilibrating the system of CNT and water molecules at 300 K and 1 atm, the CNT
temperature is raised to 700 K by velocity rescaling. This system is now
allowed to relax as a micro-canonical ensemble. Based on the lumped capacitance
analysis, the time constant of the CNT temperature response is determined,
which is then used to compute the interfacial thermal resistance. The
interfacial thermal resistance is observed to be relatively higher for the
larger diameter nanotube. This is attributed to the higher vibrational mismatch
existing for larger diameter CNT as a result of low overlapping region between
vibrational density states of CNT and water molecules. For smaller diameter
CNT, the interfacial thermal resistance is low which results in the efficient
heat transfer at the interface thus, emphasizing the indispensable role of
larger diameter CNTs in the cooling applications.

pressure of DE $p_D$ and the deceleration parameter $q$. Moreover, we study the
behavior of statefinder parameters $r$ and $s$, of the cosmographic parameters
$j$, $s_{cosmo}$, $l$ and $m$ and of the squared speed of the sound $v_s^2$ for
both case corresponding to non interacting and interacting Dark Sectors. We
also plot the quantities we have derived and we calculate their values for
$t\rightarrow 0$ (i.e. for the beginning of the Universe history), for
$t\rightarrow \infty$ (i.e. for far future) and for the present time, indicated
with $t_0$. The EoS parameters have been tested against various observational
values available in the literature.

(OVAR) was developed in this paper, and the optical performance and
characteristics of the OVAR were studied based on the model. Firstly, the
detailed distributions of the non-uniform solar flux (qsr) on the aperture and
the solar source (Ssr) in the OVAR were studied. The solar flux was found to be
relatively uniform across the aperture for a single OVAR. However the incident
angle of the rays varies between 0o and 42o, which indicates that the parallel
assumption of the rays is not appropriate at this condition. Furthermore, the
Ssr in the absorber decreases from the inlet to the outlet, and the maximum
source (Ssr,max) of 2.414X108 Wm-3 appears at the inlet. Moreover, the Ssr,max
was found to appear at the region near the wall rather than the center of the
receiver as usual for the combined effect of the non-parallel incident rays and
the diffuse reflection on the wall. In addition, study on effects of the porous
parameters indicates that the solid emissivity influences both the Ssr
distribution and the receiver efficiency significantly. However, the pore
diameter and the porosity influence Ssr distribution importantly, but have
negligible effect on the efficiency. Finally, the optical efficiency of 86.70%,
reflection loss of 13.20% and transmission loss of 0.10% were found to be
achieved by the OVAR.

power they transport due to the heat loss in the transmission lines. In this
work we explore how the transport of energy can be more efficient by adding to
the network multiple batteries that can coordinate their operations. Such
batteries can both charge using the current excess in the network or discharge
to meet the network current demand. Either way, the presence of batteries in
the network can be leveraged to mitigate the intrinsic uncertainty in the power
generation and demand and, hence, transport the energy more efficiently through
the network. We consider a resistive DC network with stochastic external
current injections or consumptions and show how the expected total heat loss
depends on the network structure and on the batteries operations. Furthermore,
in the case where the external currents are modeled by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
processes, we derive the dynamical optimal control for the batteries over a
finite time interval.

All-Spin-Logic (ASL) circuit. First, we review and expand on the physics of
previously-published analytical models on stochastic nanomagnet switching. The
limits of previously established models are defined and it is shown that these
models are valid for nanomagnet reversal times < 200 ps. Second, the insight
obtained from previous models allows us to represent the probability density
function (PDF) of the nanomagnet switching delay using the double exponential
function of the Frechet distribution. The PDF of a single nanomagnet is
extended to more complex nanomagnet circuit configurations. It is shown that
the delay-variation penalty incurred by nanomagnets arranged in parallel
configuration is dwarfed by the average delay increase for nanomagnets arranged
in a series configuration. Finally, we demonstrate the impact of device-level
performance variation on the circuit behavior using ASL logic gates. While the
analysis presented in this paper uses an ASL-AND gate as the prototype
switching circuit in the spin domain, the physical concepts are generic and can
be extended to any complex spin-based circuit.

  criteria","Selected to presented at ISMB 15",,,,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work I outline a general procedure for dynamic modeling and stability
analysis of a magnetic bearing, which is a rotating shaft confined inside a
chamber through electromagnetic forces alone. I consider the simplest type of
self-propelled bearing, namely a permanent magnet synchronous motor and an
induction motor rotor freely suspended inside the corresponding stator, and
having no eccentricity-fedback control algorithm. Writing Euler's equations for
the rotor mechanics and Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic field leads
to a systematic technique for analysing the dynamics of the complete system.
Physical arguments indicate that that two essential components for rotor
confinement are a spatial gradient in the stator magnetic field and a torque
angle lying in the second quadrant. These predictions are confirmed through the
linear stability analysis. The direct practical utility of the results is
mitigated by the presence of a repeated eigenvalue in the linearized equations.
Despite this limitation, the analysis presented can act as a good starting
point for more accurate treatments of other magnetic bearing configurations.
