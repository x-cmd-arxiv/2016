performance and provide a useful alternative for high performance applications.
However, at medium to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), an observable error
floor arises from the loss of independence of messages passed under iterative
graph-based decoding. In this paper, the error floor performance of short block
length codes is improved by use of a novel candidate selection metric in code
graph construction. The proposed Multipath EMD approach avoids harmful
structures in the graph by evaluating certain properties of the cycles which
may be introduced in each edge placement. We present Multipath EMD based
designs for several structured LDPC codes including quasi-cyclic and irregular
repeat accumulate codes. In addition, an extended class of diversity-achieving
codes on the challenging block fading channel is proposed and considered with
the Multipath EMD design. This combined approach is demonstrated to provide
gains in decoder convergence and error rate performance. A simulation study
evaluates the performance of the proposed and existing state-of-the-art
methods.

types of interference fade away as the number of base station (BS) antennas
tends to infinity. In this paper, we investigate if the channel distortions in
the absence of CP are averaged out in the large antenna regime. To this end, we
analytically study the performance of the conventional maximum ratio combining

to saturation of signal to interference (SIR). This saturation of SIR is
quantified through mathematical equations. Moreover, to resolve the saturation
problem, we propose a technique based on time-reversal MRC with zero forcing
multiuser detection (TR-ZF). Thus, the SIR of our proposed TR-ZF does not
saturate and is a linear function of the number of BS antennas. We also show
that TR-ZF only needs one OFDM demodulator per user irrespective of the number
of BS antennas; reducing the BS signal processing complexity significantly.

systems, such as the entanglement entropy and the logarithmic negativity, may
be expressed in terms of the correlation functions of local fields known as
branch point twist fields in a replica quantum field theory. In this ""replica""
approach the computation of measures of entanglement generally involves a
mathematically non-trivial analytic continuation in the number of replicas. In
this paper we consider two-point functions of twist fields and their analytic
continuation in the 1+1 dimensional massive (non-compactified) free Boson
theory. This is one of the few theories for which all matrix elements of twist
fields are known so that we may hope to compute correlation functions very
precisely. We study two particular two-point functions which are related to the
logarithmic negativity of semi-infinite disjoint intervals and to the
entanglement entropy of one interval. We show that our prescription for the
analytic continuation yields results which are in full agreement with conformal
field theory predictions in the short-distance limit. We provide numerical
estimates of universal quantities and their ratios, both in the massless (twist
field structure constants) and the massive (expectation values of twist fields)
theory. We find that particular ratios are given by divergent form factor
expansions. We propose such divergences stem from the presence of logarithmic
factors in addition to the expected power-law behaviour of two-point functions
at short-distances. Surprisingly, at criticality these corrections give rise to
a log(logL) correction to the entanglement entropy of one interval of length L.
This hitherto overlooked result is in agreement with results by Calabrese,

the distributions of SN Ia intrinsic parameters. For the $\Lambda$CDM model we
find that $\Omega_m=0.35\pm0.02$, $H_0=(67.8\pm1.0)\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}/$Mpc, while
the corrected SN absolute magnitude has a normal distribution ${\cal

realized through the formation of an intermediate phase, a Weyl semimetal, that
leads to modification of surface state dispersions. In the topologically
trivial phase, the surface states exhibit a Bychkov-Rashba type dispersion. The
Weyl semimetal phase exists in a narrow pressure interval of 0.2 GPa. After the
Weyl semimetal--TI transition occurs, the surface electronic structure is
characterized by gapless states with linear dispersion. The peculiarities of
the surface states modification under pressure depend on the band-bending

by multi-scale flow patterns, and that the meridional flows display the
North-South asymmetry closely correlating with the magnetic activity. The
latitudinal variations of the meridional circulation speed, which are probably
related to the large-scale converging flows, are mostly confined in shallow
subsurface layers. Therefore, these variations do not necessarily affect the
magnetic flux transport. The North-South asymmetry is also pronounced in the

debate recently. Studies conducted recently on a system composed by an Anderson
impurity on a 2DEG with Rashba spin-orbit have been shown that it can enhance
or suppress the Kondo temperature ($T_{\rm K}$), depending on the relative
energy level position of the impurity with respect to the particle-hole
symmetric point. Here we investigate a system composed by a single Anderson
impurity side-coupled to a quantum wire with spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We
derive an effective Hamiltonian in which the Kondo coupling is modified by the
SOC. In addition, the Hamiltonian contains two other scattering terms, the so
called Dzaloshinskyi-Moriya interaction, know to appear in these systems, and a
new one describing processes similar to the Elliott-Yafet scattering
mechanisms. By performing a renormalization group analysis on the effective
Hamiltonian, we find that the correction on the Kondo coupling due to the SOC
favors and enhancement of the Kondo temperature even in the particle-hole
symmetric point of the Anderson model, agreeing with the NRG results. Moreover,
away from the particle-hole symmetric point, $T_{\rm K}$ always increases with
the SOC, accordingly with the previous renormalization group analysis.

spaced dopings $p$ across the pseudogap critical point at $p^\star = 0.235$.
Below $p^\star$, both coefficients exhibit an upturn at low temperature, which
gets more pronounced with decreasing $p$. Taken together, these upturns show
that the normal-state carrier density $n$ at $T = 0$ drops upon entering the
pseudogap phase. Quantitatively, it goes from $n = 1 + p$ at $p = 0.24$ to $n =

revealed by the magneto-resistance. The transition has a width in doping and
some internal structure, whereby R$_H$ responds more slowly than $\rho$ to the
opening of the pseudogap. We attribute this difference to a Fermi surface that
supports both hole-like and electron-like carriers in the interval $0.2 < p <

round. Our model also includes two new parameterized generalizations: (1) the
network topology can undergo a bounded rate of change (for a parameterized rate
that spans from no changes to changes in every round); and (2) in each round,
each node can advertise a bounded amount of information to all of its neighbors
before connection decisions are made (for a parameterized number of bits that
spans from no advertisement to large advertisements). We prove that in the
mobile telephone model with no advertisements and no topology changes,
PUSH-PULL style algorithms perform poorly with respect to a graph's vertex
expansion and graph conductance as compared to the known tight results in the

advertise a single bit in each round, a natural variation of PUSH-PULL
terminates in time that matches (within logarithmic factors) this strategy's
performance in the classical telephone model---even in the presence of frequent

degrades as the rate of change increases toward the maximum possible amount. We
argue that our model matches well the properties of emerging peer-to-peer
communication standards for mobile devices, and that our efficient PUSH-PULL
variation that leverages small advertisements and adapts well to topology
changes is a good choice for rumor spreading in this increasingly important

developing effective defensive mechanisms for many critical systems and
infrastructures (e.g. biological, social and cyber networks). Most of the
existing works treat the network topology as being exogenously given and study
under what conditions an epidemic breaks out and/or extinguishes. However, if
agents are able to strategically decide their connections according to their
own self-interest, the network will instead be endogenously formed and
evolving. In such systems, the epidemic, agents' strategic decisions and the
network structure become complexly coupled and co-evolve. As a result, existing
knowledge may no longer be applicable. Built on a continuous time
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible epidemic model with strong mixing, this paper
studies stochastic epidemic networks consisting of strategic agents, who decide
the number of links to form based on a careful evaluation of its current
obtainable benefit and the potential future cost due to infection by forming
links. A game theoretical framework is developed to analyze such networks and a
number of important insights are obtained. One key result is that whereas an
epidemic eventually dies out if the effective spreading rate is sufficiently
low in exogenously given networks, it never dies out when agents are strategic
regardless of the effective spreading rate. This property leads to reduced
achievable system efficiency and considerably different optimal protection
mechanisms. Without understanding the strategic behavior of agents, significant
security cost may incur.

based implementations by breaking the paradigm of sequential execution and
accomplishing more per clock cycle by enabling hardware level parallelization
at an architectural level. Introducing parallel architectures for a
computationally intensive algorithm like Rapidly Exploring Random Trees(RRT)
will result in an exploration that is fast, dense and uniform. Through a cost
function delineated in later sections, FPGA based combinatorial architecture
delivers superlative speed-up but consumes very high power while hierarchical
architecture delivers relatively lower speed-up with acceptable power
consumption levels. To combine the qualities of both, a hybrid architecture,
that encompasses both combinatorial and hierarchical architecture, is designed.
To determine the number of RRT nodes to be allotted to the combinatorial and
hierarchical blocks of the hybrid architecture, a cost function, comprised of
fundamentally inversely related speed-up and power parameters, is formulated.
This maximization of cost function, with its associated constraints,is then
mathematically solved using a modified branch and bound, that leads to optimal
allocation of RRT modules to both blocks. It is observed that this hybrid
architecture delivers the highest performance-per-watt out of the three
architectures for differential, quad-copter and fixed wing kinematics.

application, besides high prediction accuracy, it is often desirable to
estimate class conditional probabilities for new observations. For traditional
problems where the number of observations is large, there exist many well
developed approaches. Recently, high dimensional low sample size problems are
becoming increasingly popular. Margin-based classifiers, such as logistic
regression, are well established methods in the literature. On the other hand,
in terms of probability estimation, it is known that for binary classifiers,
the commonly used methods tend to under-estimate the norm of the classification
function. This can lead to biased probability estimation. Remedy approaches
have been proposed in the literature. However, for the simultaneous
multicategory classification framework, much less work has been done. We fill
the gap in this paper. In particular, we give theoretical insights on why heavy
regularization terms are often needed in high dimensional applications, and how
this can lead to bias in probability estimation. To overcome this difficulty,
we propose a new refit strategy for multicategory angle-based classifiers. Our
new method only adds a small computation cost to the problem, and is able to
attain prediction accuracy that is as good as the regular margin-based
classifiers. On the other hand, the improvement of probability estimation can
be very significant. Numerical results suggest that the new refit approach is
highly competitive.

investigate the question whether every proper (tight) Bell inequality for two
parties, other than the trivial ones from positivity, normalization and
no-signaling can be violated by quantum correlations, i.e., whether the
classical Bell polytope or the smaller correlation polytope share any facets
with their respective quantum sets. To do this, we develop a recently derived
bound on the quantum value of linear games based on the norms of game matrices
to give a simple sufficient condition to identify linear games with no quantum
advantage. Additionally we show how this bound can be extended to the general
class of unique games, illustrating it for the case of three outcomes. We then
show as a main result that the paradigmatic examples of correlation Bell
inequalities with no quantum violation, namely the non-local computation games
do not constitute tight Bell inequalities, not even for the correlation
polytope. We also extend this to an arbitrary prime number of outcomes for a
specific class of these games. We then study the faces in the simplest CHSH
Bell scenario of binary dichotomic measurements, and identify edges in the set
of quantum correlations in this scenario.
  Finally, we relate the non-contextual polytope of single-party correlation
inequalities with the cut polytope $CUT(\nabla G)$, where $G$ denotes the
compatibility graph of observables in the contextuality scenario and $\nabla G$
denotes the suspension graph of $G$. We observe that there exist tight

global energy balance arguments. Galaxies are selected based on their position

We identify a main sequence of star-forming galaxies in the model, i.e. a well
defined relationship between sSFR and $M_\star$, up to redshift $z\sim6$. The
scatter of this relationship evolves such that it is generally larger at higher
stellar masses and higher redshifts. There is remarkable agreement between the

analysis that more than doubles the time baseline for astrometry of faint stars
orbiting Sgr A*, combining two decades of speckle imaging and adaptive optics
data. Specifically, we improve our analysis of the speckle images by using
information about a star's orbit from the deep adaptive optics data (2005 -
2013) to inform the search for the star in the speckle years (1995 - 2005).
When this new analysis technique is combined with the first complete
re-reduction of Keck Galactic Center speckle images using speckle holography,
we are able to track the short-period star S0-38 (K-band magnitude = 17,
orbital period = 19 years) through the speckle years. We use the kinematic
measurements from speckle holography and adaptive optics to estimate the orbits
of S0-38 and S0-2 and thereby improve our constraints of the mass ($M_{bh}$)
and distance ($R_o$) of Sgr A*: $M_{bh} =
4.02\pm0.16\pm0.04\times10^6~M_{\odot}$ and $7.86\pm0.14\pm0.04$ kpc. The
uncertainties in $M_{bh}$ and $R_o$ as determined by the combined orbital fit
of S0-2 and S0-38 are improved by a factor of 2 and 2.5, respectively, compared
to an orbital fit of S0-2 alone and a factor of $\sim$2.5 compared to previous
results from stellar orbits. This analysis also limits the extended dark mass
within 0.01 pc to less than $0.13\times10^{6}~M_{\odot}$ at 99.7% confidence, a

spectrally and spatially separate emission associated with star formation from

demonstrate our method using integral field data for two AGN host galaxies (NGC

Snapshot Survey (S7). The spectra of NGC 5728 and NGC 7679 form clear sequences
of AGN fraction on standard emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams. We show
that the emission line luminosities of the majority (> 85 per cent) of spectra
along each AGN fraction sequence can be reproduced by linear superpositions of
the emission line luminosities of one AGN dominated spectrum and one star

paper, we set firmer constraints on the evolutionary pathways of the most
massive central galaxies by making use of empirical estimates on their
abundances and stellar ages. The most recent abundance matching and direct
measurements strongly favour that a substantial fraction of massive galaxies
with Mstar>3x10^11 Msun reside at the centre of clusters with mass
Mhalo>3x10^13 Msun. Spectral analysis supports ages >10 Gyrs, corresponding to
a formation redshift z_form >2. We combine these two pieces of
observationally-based evidence with the mass accretion history of their host
dark matter haloes. We find that in these massive haloes, the stellar mass
locked up in the central galaxy is comparable to, if not greater than, the
total baryonic mass at z_form. These findings indicate that either only a
relatively minor fraction of their present-day stellar mass was formed in-situ
at z_form, or that these massive, central galaxies form in the extreme scenario
where almost all of the baryons in the progenitor halo are converted into
stars. Interestingly, the latter scenario would not allow for any substantial
size growth since the galaxy's formation epoch either via mergers or expansion.
We show our results hold irrespective of systematic uncertainties in stellar
mass, abundances, galaxy merger rates, stellar initial mass function, star
formation rate and dark matter accretion histories.

models of dust evolution and planetesimal formation to identify regions of
protoplanetary discs that are favourable for the formation of kilometre-sized
bodies and the first planetary embryos. We combine semi-analytical models of
viscous protoplanetary disc evolution, dust growth and drift including
backreaction of the dust particles on the gas, and planetesimal formation via
the streaming instability into one numerical code. We investigate how
planetesimal formation is affected by the mass of the protoplanetary disc, its
initial dust content, and the stickiness of dust aggregates. We find that the
dust growth and drift leads to a global redistribution of solids. The pile-up
of pebbles in the inner disc provides local conditions where the streaming
instability is effective. Planetesimals form in an annulus with its inner edge
lying between 0.3 AU and 1 AU and its width ranging from 0.3 AU to 3 AU. The
resulting surface density of planetesimals follows a radial profile that is
much steeper than the initial disc profile. These results support formation of
terrestrial planets in the solar system from a narrow annulus of planetesimals,

role of the regularization error in the noise-free case, called bias, is a
crucial point in the paper for nonlinear and linear problems. In particular,
for linear operator equations general convergence rates, including logarithmic

This allows us to extend well-known convergence rates results for the
Lavrentiev regularization that were based on general source conditions to the
case of non-selfadjoint linear monotone forward operators for which general
source conditions fail. Examples presenting the self-adjoint multiplication

  Pattern Discovery",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The traditional frequent pattern mining algorithms generate an exponentially
large number of patterns of which a substantial proportion are not much
significant for many data analysis endeavors. Discovery of a small number of
personalized interesting patterns from the large output set according to a
particular user's interest is an important as well as challenging task.
Existing works on pattern summarization do not solve this problem from the
personalization viewpoint. In this work, we propose an interactive pattern
discovery framework named PRIIME which identifies a set of interesting patterns
for a specific user without requiring any prior input on the interestingness
measure of patterns from the user. The proposed framework is generic to support
discovery of the interesting set, sequence and graph type patterns. We develop
a softmax classification based iterative learning algorithm that uses a limited
number of interactive feedback from the user to learn her interestingness
profile, and use this profile for pattern recommendation. To handle sequence
and graph type patterns PRIIME adopts a neural net (NN) based unsupervised
feature construction approach. We also develop a strategy that combines
exploration and exploitation to select patterns for feedback. We show
experimental results on several real-life datasets to validate the performance
of the proposed method. We also compare with the existing methods of
interactive pattern discovery to show that our method is substantially superior
in performance. To portray the applicability of the framework, we present a
case study from the real-estate domain.

prove that the graph of a measurable sublinear function that is

give a category form of the Berz theorem. Our proof is simpler than that of the

rather than simply being an analogue of it, and we use only DC rather than AC.
Furthermore, the category form easily generalizes: the graph of a Baire
sublinear function defined on a Banach space is a cone. The results are seen to
be of automatic-continuity type. We use Christensen Haar null sets to extend
the category approach beyond the locally compact setting where Haar measure

dynamical quantum phase transition which lies outside the framework of
equilibrium statistical mechanics. We provide a detailed study of the critical
properties of this transition at finite sizes in one dimension. We find that
the entanglement entropy of small subsystems looks strongly subthermal in the
quantum critical regime, which indicates that it varies discontinuously across
the transition as the system-size is taken to infinity, even though many other
aspects of the transition look continuous. We also study the variance of the
half-chain entanglement entropy which shows a peak near the transition, and
find substantial variation in the entropy across eigenstates of the same
sample. Further, the sample-to-sample variations in this quantity are strongly
growing, and larger than the intra-sample variations. We posit that these
results are consistent with a picture in which the transition to the thermal
phase is driven by an eigenstate-dependent sparse resonant ""backbone"" of
long-range entanglement, which just barely gains enough strength to thermalize
the system on the thermal side of the transition as the system size is taken to
infinity. This discontinuity in a global quantity --- the presence of a fully
functional bath --- in turn implies a discontinuity even for local properties.
We discuss how this picture compares with existing renormalization group
treatments of the transition.

alternative rejuvenation scheme in which the resampled particles share the same

set of independent particles provides a new alternative to compute a moment of
the target distribution and the resulting estimate is analyzed through a CLT.

first-stage weights and instrumental distributions. Finally we validate our

details of galaxy formation. A particularly interesting question is whether
void interiors are completely empty or contain a dwarf population. However the
nearby voids that are most conducive for dwarf searches have large angular
diameters, on the order of a steradian, making it difficult to redshift-map a
statistically significant portion of their volume to the magnitude limit of
dwarf galaxies. As part of addressing this problem, we investigate here the
usefulness of number counts in establishing the best locations to search inside
nearby (d < 300 Mpc) galaxy voids, utilizing Wolf plots of log(n < m) vs. m as
the basic diagnostic. To illustrate expected signatures, we consider the
signature of three void profiles, ""cut out"", ""built up"", and ""universal
profile"" carved into Monte-Carlo Schechter function models. We then investigate
the signatures of voids in the Millennium Run dark matter simulation and the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find in all of these the evidence for cut-out and
built-up voids is most discernible when the void diameter is similar to the
distance to its center. However the density distribution of the universal
profile that is characteristic of actual voids is essentially undetectable at
any distance. A useful corollary of this finding is that galaxy counts are a
reliable measure of survey completeness and stellar contamination even when
sampling through significant voids.

geometric phase is shown to significantly alter the predicted resonance

set of simplified models for the production of dark matter via a scalar,
pseudoscalar, vector, or axial vector mediator. Additional sensitivity is
achieved by tagging events consistent with the jets originating from a
hadronically decaying vector boson. This search uses jet substructure
techniques to identify hadronically decaying vector bosons in both
Lorentz-boosted and resolved scenarios. This analysis yields improvements of
80% in terms of excluded signal cross sections with respect to the previous CMS

applied to moving boundary problems. The basic idea is to reduce the system
with varying domains to one in a fixed domain. This is done by a transformation
(the so-called Hanzawa transformation) and yields a typically nonlocal and
nonlinear coupled system of (evolution) equations. Well-posedness results can
then often be established as soon as it is proved that the relevant
linearization is the generator of an analytic semigroup or admits maximal
regularity. To implement this program, it is necessary to somehow parametrize
to space of boundaries/domains (typically the space of compact hypersurfaces
$\Gamma$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, in the Euclidean setting). This has traditionally
been achieved by means of the already mentioned Hanzawa transformation. The
approach, while successful, requires the introduction of a smooth manifold
$\Gamma_\infty$ close to the manifold $\Gamma_0$ in which one cares to
linearize. This prevents one to use coordinates in which $\Gamma_0$ lies at
their ""center"". As a result formul{\ae} tend to contain terms that would
otherwise not be present were one able to linearize in a neighborhood emanating
from $\Gamma_0$ instead of from $\Gamma_\infty$. In this paper it is made use
of flows (curves of diffeomorphisms) to obtain a general form of the relevant
linearization in combination with an alternative coordinatization of the
manifold of hypersurfaces, which circumvents the need for the introduction of a
""phantom"" reference manifold $\Gamma_\infty$ by, in its place, making use of a
""phantom geometry"" on $\Gamma_0$. The upshot is a clear insight into the
structure of the linearization, simplified calculations, and simpler
formul{\ae} for the resulting linear operators, which are useful in
applications.

planet can generate a primary vortex (which dissipates at longer timescales,
becoming an axisymmetric ring) and trigger the formation of a second generation
vortex further out. Within this scenario the two spiral arms observed at

by intrinsic emission but may also have a foreground Faraday screen component.
At these wavelengths, the compactness of the MWA baseline distribution provides
excellent snapshot sensitivity to large-scale structure. The observations are
sensitive to diffuse polarized emission at ~54' resolution with a sensitivity
of 5.9 mJy beam^-1 and compact polarized sources at ~2.4' resolution with a
sensitivity of 2.3 mJy beam^-1 for a subset (400 deg^2) of this field. The
sensitivity allows the effect of ionospheric Faraday rotation to be spatially

polarization clearly detectable in ~2 minute snapshots, which would remain
undetectable by interferometers with minimum baseline lengths >110 m at 154

involving weakly bound three-cluster nuclei. Borromean, two-nucleon, halo
nuclei are candidates of unstable three-fragments projectiles. The model is
based on the theory of inclusive breakup reactions commonly employed in the
treatment of incomplete fusion and surrogate method. The theory was developed
in the 80's by Ichimura, Autern and Vincent (IAV) [Phys. Rev. C 32, 431 (1985)]
\cite{IAV1985}, Udagawa and Tamura (UT)[Phys. Rev. C 24, 1348 (1981)],
\cite{UT1981} and Hussein and McVoy (HM)[Nucl. Phys. A 445, 124 (1985)],
\cite{HM1985}. We extend these three-body theories to derive an expression for
the fragment yield in the reaction $A\,(a,b)\,X$, where the projectile is $a =
x_1 + x_2 + b$. The inclusive breakup cross section is found to be the sum of a
generalized four-body form of the elastic breakup cross section plus the
inclusive non-elastic breakup cross section which involves the ""reaction"" cross
section of the participant fragments, $x_1$ and $x_2$. The final result is
similar to the three-body case reviewed in Austern, et al. (Phys. Rep.
\textbf{154}, 125 (1987)), \cite{Austern1987}, but with important genuine
four-body effects added, both in the elastic breakup cross section, which now
contains the full correlations between the participant fragments, and in the
inclusive non- elastic breakup. These developments should encourage
experimentalists to seek more information about the $x_{1} + x_{2}$ system in
the elastic breakup cross section, and to theorists to further develop and
extend the surrogate method, based on the inclusive non-elastic breakup part of
the $b$ spectrum.

shares the same set of mathematical formulas with the harmonic oscillator in
the Lorentz-covariant world. It is thus possible to transfer the concept of
entanglement to the Lorentz-covariant picture of the bound state which requires
both space and time separations between two constituent particles. These space
and time variables become entangled as the bound state moves with a
relativistic speed. It is shown also that our inability to measure the
time-separation variable leads to an entanglement entropy together with a rise
in the temperature of the bound state. As was noted by Paul A. M. Dirac in
1963, the system of two oscillators contains the symmetries of O(3,2) de Sitter
group containing two O(3,1) Lorentz groups as its subgroups. Dirac noted also
that the system contains the symmetry of the Sp(4) group which serves as the
basic language for two-mode squeezed states. Since the Sp(4) symmetry contains
both rotations and squeezes, one interesting case is the combination of
rotation and squeeze resulting in a shear. While the current literature is
mostly on the entanglement based on squeeze along the normal coordinates, the
shear transformation is an interesting future possibility. The mathematical

standard property testing model, an algorithm accesses the input function via
an oracle that returns function values at all queried domain points. In many
realistic situations, the oracle may be unable to reveal the function values at
some domain points due to privacy concerns, or when some of the values get
erased by mistake or by an adversary.
  We initiate a study of property testers that are resilient to the presence of
adversarially erased function values. An alpha-erasure-resilient epsilon-tester
for a property P is given parameters alpha, epsilon in (0,1), along with oracle
access to a function f such that at most an alpha fraction of the function
values have been erased. The tester does not know whether a point is erased
unless it queries that point. The tester has to accept with high probability if
there is a way to assign values to the erased points such that the resulting
function satisfies P. It has to reject with high probability if, for all
assignments of values to the erased points, the resulting function has to be
changed in at least an epsilon-fraction of the nonerased domain points to
satisfy P.
  We design erasure-resilient property testers for a large class of properties.
For some properties, it is possible to obtain erasure-resilient testers by
using standard testers as a black box. But there are more challenging
properties for which all known testers rely on querying a specific point. If
this point is erased, all these testers break. We give efficient
erasure-resilient testers for several classes of such properties including
monotonicity, the Lipschitz property, and convexity. Finally, we describe a
property that can be epsilon-tested with O(1/epsilon) queries in the standard
model, whereas testing it in the erasure-resilient model requires number of
queries polynomial in the input size.

for 160 non-detections, we find that its G, K, and M stars have a similar
median (0.5$-$7 keV) X-ray luminosity L$_X =10^{29.0}$ erg/s, whereas the
L$_X$-to-bolometric-luminosity ratio (L$_X$/L$_{bol}$) indicates that M stars
are more active than G and K stars by $\approx$1 order of magnitude at 500 Myr.
To characterize the evolution of magnetic activity in low-mass stars over their
first $\approx$600 Myr, we consolidate X-ray and optical data from the
literature for stars in six other open clusters: from youngest to oldest, the
Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), NGC 2547, NGC 2516, the Pleiades, NGC 6475, and the
Hyades. For these, we homogenize the conversion of instrumental count rates to
L$_X$ by applying the same one-temperature emission model as for M37, and
obtain masses using the same empirical mass-absolute magnitude relation (except
for the ONC). We find that for G and K stars X-ray activity decreases
$\approx$2 orders of magnitude over their first 600 Myr, and for M stars,
$\approx$1.5. The decay rate of the median L$_X$ follows the relation L$_X
\propto~t^b$, where $b=-0.61\pm0.12$ for G, $-0.82\pm0.16$ for K, and
$-0.40\pm0.17$ for M stars. In L$_X$/L$_{bol}$ space, the slopes are
$-0.68\pm0.12$, $-0.81\pm0.19$, and $-0.61\pm0.12$, respectively. These results
suggest that for low-mass stars the age-activity relation steepens after
$\approx$625 Myr, consistent with the faster decay in activity observed in
solar analogs at $t>1$ Gyr.

localization is a necessity, such as ad-hoc wireless sensor networks that allow
the placement of a few anchors that know their location or sensor arrays that
are tracking a target. In most of these situations, the quality of localization
depends on the relative angle between the target and the pair of sensors
observing it. In this paper, we consider placing a small number of sensors
which ensure good angular $\alpha$-coverage: given $\alpha$ in $[0,\pi/2]$, for
each target location $t$, there must be at least two sensors $s_1$ and $s_2$
such that the $\angle(s_1 t s_2)$ is in the interval $[\alpha, \pi-\alpha]$.
One of the main difficulties encountered in such problems is that since the
constraints depend on at least two sensors, building a solution must account
for the inherent dependency between selected sensors, a feature that generic
Set Cover techniques do not account for. We introduce a general framework that
guarantees an angular coverage that is arbitrarily close to $\alpha$ for any
$\alpha <= \pi/3$ and apply it to a variety of problems to get bi-criteria
approximations. When the angular coverage is required to be at least a constant
fraction of $\alpha$, we obtain results that are strictly better than what
standard geometric Set Cover methods give. When the angular coverage is
required to be at least $(1-1/\delta)\cdot\alpha$, we obtain a
$\mathcal{O}(\log \delta)$- approximation for sensor placement with
$\alpha$-coverage on the plane. In the presence of additional distance or
visibility constraints, the framework gives a $\mathcal{O}(\log\delta\cdot\log
k_{OPT})$-approximation, where $k_{OPT}$ is the size of the optimal solution.
We also use our framework to give a $\mathcal{O}(\log \delta)$-approximation
that ensures $(1-1/\delta)\cdot \alpha$-coverage and covers every target within
distance $3R$.

MR exhibits quadratic field dependence at low fields and tends towards
saturation at high fields; while for B//a, MR presents quadratic field

the so-called ""system-plus-reservoir"" approach. In this work we assign their
description to the Maximum Entropy Formalism and compare the resulting
thermodynamic properties with those of the well - established approaches. Due
to the non-negligible coupling to the heat reservoir, these systems are
non-extensive by nature, and the former task may require the use of
non-extensive parameter dependent informational entropies. In doing so, we
address the problem of choosing appropriate forms of those entropies in order
to describe a consistent thermodynamics for dissipative quantum systems.
Nevertheless, even having chosen the most successful and popular forms of those
entropies, we have proven our model to be a counterexample where this sort of
approach leads us to wrong results.

  Problems","Groups Complexity Cryptology - De Gruyter, 2016",,,,"cs.CR math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Polycyclic groups are natural generalizations of cyclic groups but with more
complicated algorithmic properties. They are finitely presented and the word,
conjugacy, and isomorphism decision problems are all solvable in these groups.
Moreover, the non-virtually nilpotent ones exhibit an exponential growth rate.
These properties make them suitable for use in group-based cryptography, which
was proposed in 2004 by Eick and Kahrobaei. Since then, many cryptosystems have
been created that employ polycyclic groups. These include key exchanges such as
non-commutative ElGamal, authentication schemes based on the twisted conjugacy
problem, and secret sharing via the word problem. In response, heuristic and
deterministic methods of cryptanalysis have been developed, including the
length-based and linear decomposition attacks. Despite these efforts, there are
classes of infinite polycyclic groups that remain suitable for cryptography.
The analysis of algorithms for search and decision problems in polycyclic
groups has also been developed. In addition to results for the aforementioned
problems we present those concerning polycyclic representations, group
morphisms, and orbit decidability. Though much progress has been made, many
algorithmic and complexity problems remain unsolved, we conclude with a number
of them. Of particular interest is to show that cryptosystems using infinite
polycyclic groups are resistant to cryptanalysis on a quantum computer.

morphological evolution for application to bedload-dominated problems. The near
bed transport region is represented by the lower (bedload) layer which has an
arbitrarily constant, vanishing thickness (of approximately ten times the
sediment particle diameter), and whose average sediment concentration is free
to vary. Sediment is allowed to enter the upper layer, and so total load may
also be simulated, provided that concentrations of suspended sediment remain
low. The model conforms with established theories of bedload, and is validated
satisfactorily against empirical expressions for sediment transport rates and
the morphodynamic experiment of a migrating mining pit by Lee et al. (1993).
Investigation into the effect of a local bed gradient on bedload leads to
derivation of an analytical, physically meaningful expression for morphological
diffusion induced by a non-zero local bed slope. Incorporation of the proposed
morphological diffusion into a conventional morphodynamic model (defined as a
coupling between the shallow water equations, Exner equation and an empirical
formula for bedload) improves model predictions when applied to the evolution
of a mining pit, without the need either to resort to special numerical
treatment of the equations or to use additional tuning parameters.

equilibrium equations is expanded in power series, which can be continued up to

regularized by object poses. Pose information is only used as feedback signal

feedforward network only predicts category. To validate the approach, we train
both 2W-CNN and AlexNet using a fraction of the dataset, and 2W-CNN achieves 6%

2W-CNN has inherent advantages over AlexNet under the stochastic gradient

iLab-20M, results show that significant improvements have been achieved,

reduce the computational complexity for deterministic fitting methods. SDF also
includes two original elements, i.e., a deterministic sampling algorithm and a
novel model selection algorithm. The two algorithms are tightly coupled to
boost the performance of SDF in both speed and accuracy. Specifically, the
proposed sampling algorithm leverages the grouping cues of superpixels to
generate reliable and consistent hypotheses. The proposed model selection
algorithm further makes use of desirable properties of the generated
hypotheses, to improve the conventional fit-and-remove framework for more
efficient and effective performance. The key characteristic of SDF is that it
can efficiently and deterministically estimate the parameters of model
instances in multi-structure data. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SDF shows superiority over several state-of-the-art fitting methods
for real images with single-structure and multiple-structure data.

features useful for object categories, but invariant to other factors of
variation as much as possible. These architectures do not explicitly learn
other factors, like pose and lighting, instead, they usually discard them by
pooling and normalization. In this work, we take the opposite approach: we
train ConvNets for object recognition by retaining other factors (pose in our
case) and learn them jointly with object category. We design a new multi-task
leaning (MTL) ConvNet, named disentangling CNN (disCNN), which explicitly
enforces the disentangled representations of object identity and pose, and is
trained to predict object categories and pose transformations. We show that
disCNN achieves significantly better object recognition accuracies than AlexNet
trained solely to predict object categories on the iLab-20M dataset, which is a
large scale turntable dataset with detailed object pose and lighting
information. We further show that the pretrained disCNN/AlexNet features on
iLab- 20M generalize to object recognition on both Washington RGB-D and

than the pretrained AlexNet features for fine-tuning object recognition on the

decomposition of the radio light curve reveals nine prominent flares. The
measured variability parameters of the source show values typical for
Fermi-detected quasars. Combined analysis of radio and gamma-ray emission
implies a spatial separation between emitting regions at these bands of about
12 pc and locates the gamma-ray emission within a parsec from the central
engine. We detected changes in the value and direction of the linear
polarization and the Faraday rotation measure. The value of the intrinsic
brightness temperature of the core is above the equipartition state, while its
value as a function of distance from the core is well approximated by the
power-law. Altogether these results show that the radio flaring activity of the

laid the foundation of modern muscle modeling, linking chemical events to

contraction through the cyclical attachment and detachment of myosin motors to
the actin filament with ad hoc assumptions on the dependence of the rate
constants on the strain of the myosin motors. That relatively simple hypothesis
is still present in recent models, even though with several modifications to
adapt the model to the different experimental constraints which became
subsequently available. However, already in that paper, one controversial
aspect of the model became clear. Relatively high attachment and detachment
rates of myosin to the actin filament were needed to simulate the high power
output at intermediate velocity of contraction. However, these rates were
incompatible with the relatively slow rise in tension after activation, despite
the rise should be generated by the same rate functions. This discrepancy has
not been fully solved till today, despite several hypotheses have been
forwarded to reconcile the two aspects. Here, using a conventional muscle
model, we show that the recently revealed mechanosensing mechanism of
recruitment of myosin motors \cite{Linarietal2015} can solve this long standing

procedure to meaningfully separate the two processes needs to be employed. In
order to define $tWH$ production for both total rates and differential

short-distance events to a parton shower. We formulate a reliable prescription
to estimate the theoretical uncertainties, including those associated to the
very definition of the process at NLO. Finally, we study the sensitivity to a

we make a novel systematic effort to address this multifaceted question. We
craft three generally applicable policies and experimentally evaluate the VPKI

of this electromagnon drops from 36 to 25 cm$^{-1}$ and its damping gradually
increases, so it becomes overdamped at room temperature. Applying external
magnetic field has a similar effect on the damping and frequency of the
electromagnon, and the mode is no more observable in the THz spectra above 2 T,

manifests itself in the appearance of the magnetic spin polarization in
response to a dissipationless electric current (supercurrent). While much
attention has been dedicated to the thermodynamic version of this phenomenon
(Edelstein effect), non-equilibrium transport magnetoelectric effects have not
been explored yet. We propose the magnetoelectric Andreev effect (MAE) which
consists in the generation of spin-polarized triplet Andreev conductance by an
electric supercurrent. The MAE stems from the spin polarization of the
Cooper-pair condensate due to a supercurrent-induced non-unitary triplet
pairing. We propose the realization of such non-unitary pairing and MAE in
superconducting proximity structures based on two-dimensional helical metals --
strongly spin-orbit-coupled electronic systems with the Dirac spectrum such as
the topological surface states. Our results uncover an unexplored route towards
electrically controlled superconducting spintronics and are a smoking gun for
induced unconventional superconductivity in spin-orbit-coupled materials.

variety of linear state-space models for time series. These models are of great

above $10^{9}$ GeV, based on an analysis of seven years of IceCube data. This
analysis efficiently selects very high energy neutrino-induced events which
have deposited energies from $\sim 10^6$ GeV to above $10^{11}$ GeV. Two
neutrino-induced events with an estimated deposited energy of $(2.6 \pm 0.3)
\times 10^6$ GeV, the highest neutrino energies observed so far, and $(7.7 \pm
2.0) \times 10^5$ GeV were detected. The atmospheric background-only hypothesis
of detecting these events is rejected at 3.6$\sigma$. The hypothesis that the
observed events are of cosmogenic origin is also rejected at $>$99% CL because
of the limited deposited energy and the non-observation of events at higher
energy, while their observation is consistent with an astrophysical origin. Our
limits on cosmogenic neutrino fluxes disfavor the UHECR sources having
cosmological evolution stronger than the star formation rate, e.g., active
galactic nuclei and $\gamma$-ray bursts, assuming proton-dominated UHECRs.
Constraints on UHECR sources including mixed and heavy UHECR compositions are
obtained for models of neutrino production within UHECR sources. Our limit
disfavors a significant part of parameter space for active galactic nuclei and
new-born pulsar models.

human life expectancy. With the ageing of populations, new un-faced challenges
are brought to science. The human body is naturally selected to be
well-functioning until the age of reproduction to keep the species alive.
However, as the lifespan extends, unseen problems due to the body deterioration
emerge. There are several age-related diseases with no appropriate treatment;
therefore, the complex ageing phenomena needs further understanding.
Immunosenescence, the ageing of the immune system, is highly correlated to the
negative effects of ageing, such as the increase of auto-inflammatory diseases
and decrease in responsiveness to new diseases. Besides clinical and
mathematical tools, we believe there is opportunity to further exploit
simulation tools to understand immunosenescence. Compared to real-world
experimentation, benefits include time and cost effectiveness due to the
laborious, resource-intensiveness of the biological environment and the
possibility of conducting experiments without ethic restrictions. Contrasted
with mathematical models, simulation modelling is more suitable for
representing complex systems and emergence. In addition, there is the belief
that simulation models are easier to communicate in interdisciplinary contexts.
Our work investigates the usefulness of simulations to understand
immunosenescence by employing two different simulation methods, agent-based and
system dynamics simulation, to a case study of immune cells depletion with age.

determine the total mass of galaxy clusters. The shear profile as inferred from
the statistics of ellipticity of background galaxies allows to probe the
cluster intermediate and outer regions thus determining the virial mass
estimate. However, the mass sheet degeneracy and the need for a large number of
background galaxies motivate the search for alternative tracers which can break
the degeneracy among model parameters and hence improve the accuracy of the
mass estimate. Lensing flexion, i.e. the third derivative of the lensing
potential, has been suggested as a good answer to the above quest since it
probes the details of the mass profile. We investigate here whether this is
indeed the case considering jointly using weak lensing, magnification and
flexion. We use a Fisher matrix analysis to forecast the relative improvement
in the mass accuracy for different assumptions on the shear and flexion signal
- to - noise (S/N) ratio also varying the cluster mass, redshift, and
ellipticity. It turns out that the error on the cluster mass may be reduced up
to a factor 2 for reasonable values of the flexion S/N ratio. As a general
result, we get that the improvement in mass accuracy is larger for more
flattened haloes, but extracting general trends is a difficult because of the
many parameters at play. We nevertheless find that flexion is as efficient as
magnification to increase the accuracy in both mass and concentration
determination.

lead to erroneous conclusions about the best model. The aim here is to
introduce some robust statistical techniques for model comparison to the solar
waves community, drawing on the experiences from other areas of astrophysics.
In the process, we also aim to investigate the physics of coronal loop

the model to describe the observations, and show how they can be assessed using
various statistical tests. In particular we discuss the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff one

importance of including any observational trend line in the model-fitting

coronal loop undergoing standing kink motion is used. The model comparison
techniques provide evidence that a Gaussian damping profile provides a better
description of the observed wave attenuation than the often used exponential
profile. This supports previous analysis from Pascoe et al. (2016). Further, we
use the model comparison to provide evidence of time-dependent wave properties
of a kink oscillation, attributing the behaviour to the thermodynamic evolution

companies' share price stability over a period of time or how to classify
students' preferences for subjects while they are progressing through school. A
specific case the paper considers is the strategy of players in public goods
games (as common in economics) across multiple consecutive games. Initial
classification starts from expert definitions specifying class allocation for
players based on aggregated attributes of the temporal data. Based on these
initial classifications, the optimisation process tries to find an improved
classifier which produces the best possible compact classes of objects
(players) for every time point in the temporal data. The compactness of the
classes is measured by a cost function based on internal cluster indices like
the Dunn Index, distance measures like Euclidean distance or statistically
derived measures like standard deviation. The paper discusses the approach in
the context of incorporating changing player strategies in the aforementioned
public good games, where common classification approaches so far do not
consider such changes in behaviour resulting from learning or in-game
experience. By using the proposed process for classifying temporal data and the
actual players' contribution during the games, we aim to produce a more refined
classification which in turn may inform the interpretation of public goods game

distribution in energy network, which is composed of physical flow layer and
cyber communication layer. The physical energy flows through the physical
layer; but all the energies are coordinated to generate and flow by distributed
coordination algorithms on the basis of communication information. First,
distributed energy generation and energy distribution laws are proposed in a
decoupled way without considering the interactive characteristics between the
energy generation and energy distribution. Then, a joint coordination law is
designed in a coupled way taking account of the interactive characteristics.
The coordination laws proposed in this paper are fully distributed in the sense
that they are decided optimally only using relative information among
neighboring nodes. Through numerical simulations, the validity of the proposed
distributed coordination laws is illustrated.

could be a natural source for emergent gauge symmetries. Actually, some
proposed vector field potential terms or polynomial vector field constraints
introduced in five-dimensional Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theory is shown to
smoothly lead to spontaneous violation of an underlying 5D spacetime symmetry
and generate pseudo-Goldstone vector modes as conventional 4D gauge boson
candidates. As a special signature, there appear, apart from conventional gauge
couplings, some properly suppressed direct multi-photon (multi-boson, in
general) interactions in emergent QED and Yang-Mills theories whose observation
could shed light on their high-dimensional nature. Moreover, in emergent
Yang-Mills theories an internal symmetry G also occurs spontaneously broken to
its diagonal subgroups once 5D Lorentz violation happens. This breaking origins
from the extra vector field components playing a role of some adjoint scalar
field multiplet in the 4D spacetime. So, one naturally has the Higgs effect
without a specially introduced scalar field multiplet. Remarkably, when being
applied to Grand Unified Theories this results in a fact that the emergent GUTs
generically appear broken down to the Standard Model just at the 5D Lorentz
violation scale M.

FU Orionis-type object with an atypically low outburst luminosity. Because it
was well characterized in the pre-outburst phase, HBC 722 is one of the few
FUors where we can learn about the physical changes and processes associated
with the eruption. We monitored the source in the BVRIJHKs bands from the
ground, and at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m from space with the Spitzer Space Telescope.
We analyzed the light curves and the spectral energy distribution by fitting a
series of steady accretion disk models at many epochs. We also analyzed the
spectral properties of the source based on new optical and infrared spectra. We
also mapped HBC 722 and its surroundings at millimeter wavelengths. From the
light curve analysis we concluded that the first peak of the outburst in 2010
September was due to an abrupt increase of the accretion rate in the innermost
part of the system. This was followed by a long term process, when the
brightening was mainly due to a gradual increase of the accretion rate and the
emitting area. Our new observations show that the source is currently in a
constant plateau phase. We found that around the peak the continuum was bluer
and the H$\alpha$ profile changed significantly between 2012 and 2013. The
source was not detected in the millimeter continuum, but we discovered a
flattened molecular gas structure with a diameter of 1700 au and mass of 0.3
M$_{\odot}$ centered on HBC 722. While the first brightness peak could be
interpreted as a rapid fall of piled-up material from the inner disk onto the
star, the later monotonic flux rise suggests the outward expansion of a hot
component according to the theory of Bell & Lin (1994). Our study of HBC 722
demonstrated that accretion-related outbursts can occur in young stellar
objects even with very low mass disks, in the late Class II phase.

possibility to couple on-shell dark photons to standard-model fermions via

Spectral methods are better suited to deal with such artificial singularities
related to the choice of a coordinate system. When the radiating object is
rotating like for instance a star, special classes of solutions to Maxwell
equations are worthwhile to study such as quasi-stationary regimes. Moreover,
in high-energy astrophysics, strong gravitational and magnetic fields are
present especially around rotating neutron stars. In order to study such
systems, we designed an algorithm to solve the time-dependent Maxwell equations

electrodynamical corrections to leading order. As a diagnostic, we compute the
spindown luminosity expected from these stars and compare it to the classical

quantum electrodynamics leads to an irrelevant change in the spindown
luminosity even for magnetic field around the critical value of
$\numprint{4.4e9}$~\si{\tesla}. Therefore the braking index remains close to
its value for a point dipole in vacuum namely $n=3$. The same conclusion holds

proprioceptive -- the former conveying information about skin stimulation, the
latter about limb position and movement. The principal proprioceptors are
constituted by muscle spindles, which deliver information about muscle length
and speed. In primates, this information is relayed to the primary
somatosensory cortex and eventually the posterior parietal cortex, where
integrated information about body posture (postural schema) is presumably
available. However, coming from robotics and seeking a biologically motivated
model that could be used in a humanoid robot, we faced a number of
difficulties. First, it is not clear what neurons in the ascending pathway and
primary somatosensory cortex code. To an engineer, joint angles would seem the
most useful variables. However, the lengths of individual muscles have
nonlinear relationships with the angles at joints. Kim et al. (Neuron, 2015)
found different types of proprioceptive neurons in the primary somatosensory
cortex -- sensitive to movement of single or multiple joints or to static
postures. Second, there are indications that the somatotopic arrangement (""the
homunculus"") of these brain areas is to a significant extent learned. However,
the mechanisms behind this developmental process are unclear. We will report
first results from modeling of this process using data obtained from body
babbling in the iCub humanoid robot and feeding them into a Self-Organizing Map
(SOM). Our results reveal that the SOM algorithm is only suited to develop
receptive fields of the posture-selective type. Furthermore, the SOM algorithm
has intrinsic difficulties when combined with population code on its input and
in particular with nonlinear tuning curves (sigmoids or Gaussians).

  Correlation","submitted to MICCAI 2016",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Echocardiography plays an important part in diagnostic aid in cardiac
diseases. A critical step in echocardiography-aided diagnosis is to extract the
standard planes since they tend to provide promising views to present different
structures that are benefit to diagnosis. To this end, this paper proposes a
spatial-temporal embedding framework to extract the standard view planes from
4D STIC (spatial-temporal image corre- lation) volumes. The proposed method is
comprised of three stages, the frame smoothing, spatial-temporal embedding and
final classification. In first stage, an L 0 smoothing filter is used to
preprocess the frames that removes the noise and preserves the boundary. Then a
compact repre- sentation is learned via embedding spatial and temporal features
into a latent space in the supervised scheme considering both standard plane
information and diagnosis result. In last stage, the learned features are fed
into support vector machine to identify the standard plane. We eval- uate the
proposed method on a 4D STIC volume dataset with 92 normal cases and 93
abnormal cases in three standard planes. It demonstrates that our method
outperforms the baselines in both classification accuracy and computational
efficiency.

in Dirac fermion systems under the influence of external electromagnetic

particles happens in momentum space. We here describe an intriguing way to
introduce the chiral anomaly into real space. Our system consists of two
quantum dots that are formed at the helical edge of a quantum spin Hall
insulator on the basis of three magnetic impurities. Such a setup gives rise to
fractional charges which we show to be sharp quantum numbers for large barrier
strength. Interestingly, it is possible to map the system onto a quantum spin
Hall ring in the presence of a flux pierced through the ring where the relative
angle between the magnetization directions of the impurities takes the role of
the flux. The chiral anomaly in this system is then directly related to the
excess occupation of particles in the two quantum dots. This analogy allows us
to predict an observable consequence of the chiral anomaly in real space.

extensive efforts to find more efficient algorithms, the best-known algorithms
for computing the DTW or GED between two sequences of points in $X =
\mathbb{R}^d$ are long-standing dynamic programming algorithms that require
quadratic runtime, even for the one-dimensional case $d = 1$, which is perhaps
one of the most used in practice.
  In this paper, we break the nearly 50 years old quadratic time bound for
computing DTW or GED between two sequences of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}$, by
presenting deterministic algorithms that run in $O\left( n^2 / \log\log n
\right)$ time. Our algorithms can be extended to work also for higher
dimensional spaces $\mathbb{R}^d$, for any constant $d$, when the underlying
distance-metric $\mathrm{dist}$ is polyhedral (e.g., $L_1, L_\infty$).

hydrogen seen in absorption against the radio source J0855+5751. The foreground
absorber (SDSS~J085519.05+575140.7) is a dwarf galaxy at $z$ = 0.026. As the
background source is heavily resolved by VLBI, the data allow us to map the
properties of the foreground HI gas with a spatial resolution of 2pc. The
absorbing gas corresponds to a single coherent structure with an extent
$>$35pc, but we also detect significant and coherent variations, including a
change in the HI optical depth by a factor of five across a distance of
$\leq$6pc. The large size of the structure provides support for the Heiles &
Troland model of the ISM, as well as its applicability to external galaxies.
The large variations in HI optical depth also suggest that caution should be
applied when interpreting $T_S$ measurements from radio-detected DLAs. In
addition, the distorted appearance of the background radio source is indicative
of a strong jet-cloud interaction in its host galaxy. We have measured its
redshift ($z$ = 0.54186) using optical spectroscopy on the William Herschel
Telescope and this confirms that J0855+5751 is a FRII radio source with a
physical extent of $<$1kpc and supports the previous identification of this
source as a Compact Symmetric Object. These sources often show absorption
associated with the host galaxy and we suggest that both HI and OH should be

overflows its Roche lobe and unstable mass transfer leads to a spiral-in of the
companion, resulting in a close binary system or in a merger of the stellar
cores. Dynamo processes during the CE phase have been proposed as a mechanism
to generate magnetic fields that are important for forming magnetic white
dwarfs (MWDs) and for shaping planetary nebulae. Here, we present the first
magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the dynamical spiral-in during a CE phase.
We find that magnetic fields are strongly amplified in the accretion stream
around the $1M_\odot$ companion as it spirals into the envelope of a $2M_\odot$
RG. This leads to field strengths of 10 to 100 kG throughout the envelope after
120 d. The magnetic field amplification is consistent with being driven by the
magnetorotational instability. The field strengths reached in our simulation
make the magnetic field interesting for diagnostic purposes, but they are
dynamically irrelevant. They are also too small to explain the formation of the
highest fields found in MWDs, but may be relevant for luminous red novae, and
detecting magnetic fields in these events would support the scenario as
proposed here.

dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the quantum bounce, we find
that both evolutions of the background and its perturbations are independent of
the inflationary potentials during the pre-inflationary phase. During this
period the effective potentials of the perturbations can be well approximated
by a P\""oschl-Teller (PT) potential, from which we find analytically the mode
functions and then calculate the corresponding Bogoliubov coefficients at the

single scalar field. Imposing the Bunch-Davies (BD) vacuum in the contracting
phase prior to the bounce when the modes are all inside the Hubble horizon, we
show that particles are generically created due to the pre-inflation dynamics.
Matching them to those obtained in the slow-roll inflationary phase, we
investigate the effects of the pre-inflation dynamics on the scalar and tensor
power spectra and find features that can be tested by current and forthcoming

diffusion time in RFNs can be predicted by using structural and dynamical
parameters of the RRNGs. Finally, we also explore some potential extensions of

network. Thevenin equivalent calculation based on changes in system with
multiple sources integrated with grid, isolated distributed generator system is
analysed and nonlinear least square fit estimation technique for algorithm is
adopted. Linear least square fit is used with a linearized model. Performance
evaluation of proposed method is carried out through mathematical model,
nonlinear and linear least square fit based algorithm technique and simulation
through MATLAB/SIMULINK package. Accurate grid and source side impedance
estimation technique is applicable for distributed generation sources
interfaced with grid to improve dynamic response, stability, reliability when
subjected to faults or any other disturbances in network. Algorithm can
accurately estimate Thevenin equivalent of multiple sources connected in
parallel simultaneously with voltage and current phasor measurements at point
of common coupling. Mathematical analysis and simulation results validate the
effectiveness of proposed method.

structural importance of complex networks. In the previous work (Xu et al, 2016
\cite{xu2016}), we measure the contribution of a path in link prediction with
information entropy. In this paper, we further quantify the contribution of a
path with both path entropy and path weight, and propose a weighted prediction
index based on the contributions of paths, namely Weighted Path Entropy (WPE),
to improve the prediction accuracy in weighted networks. Empirical experiments
on six weighted real-world networks show that WPE achieves higher prediction
accuracy than three typical weighted indices.
