account clearing debt obligations. The evolution of log-monetary reserves of
$N$ banks is described by coupled diffusions driven by controls with delay in
their drifts. Banks are minimizing their finite-horizon objective functions
which take into account a quadratic cost for lending or borrowing and a linear
incentive to borrow if the reserve is low or lend if the reserve is high
relative to the average capitalization of the system. As such, our problem is
an $N$-player linear-quadratic stochastic differential game with delay. An
open-loop Nash equilibrium is obtained using a system of fully coupled forward

the delay affects liquidity and systemic risk characterized by a large number
of defaults. We also derive a close-loop Nash equilibrium using an HJB

  Combining Local Optimization with Global Exploration","8 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Computing globally optimal motion plans for a robot is challenging in part
because it requires analyzing a robot's configuration space simultaneously from
both a macroscopic viewpoint (i.e., considering paths in multiple homotopic
classes) and a microscopic viewpoint (i.e., locally optimizing path quality).
We introduce Interleaved Optimization with Sampling-based Motion Planning
(IOS-MP), a new method that effectively combines global exploration and local
optimization to quickly compute high quality motion plans. Our approach
combines two paradigms: (1) asymptotically-optimal sampling-based motion
planning, which is effective at global exploration but relatively slow at
locally refining paths, and (2) optimization-based motion planning, which
locally optimizes paths quickly but lacks a global view of the configuration
space. IOS-MP iteratively alternates between global exploration and local
optimization, sharing information between the two, to improve motion planning
efficiency. We evaluate IOS-MP as it scales with respect to dimensionality and
complexity, as well as demonstrate its effectiveness on a 7-DOF manipulator for
tasks specified using goal configurations and workspace goal regions.

due to turbulent transport of momentum. In this work, we investigate the effect
of the Shafranov shift on this intrinsic rotation, primarily by analyzing
tokamaks with tilted elliptical flux surfaces. By expanding the Grad-Shafranov
equation in the large aspect ratio limit we calculate the magnitude and
direction of the Shafranov shift in tilted elliptical tokamaks. The results
show that, while the Shafranov shift becomes up-down asymmetric and depends
strongly on the tilt angle of the flux surfaces, it is insensitive to the shape
of the current and pressure profiles (when the geometry, total plasma current,
and average pressure gradient are kept fixed). Next, local nonlinear
gyrokinetic simulations of these MHD equilibria are performed with GS2, which
reveal that the Shafranov shift can significantly enhance the momentum
transport. However, to be consistent, the effect of $\beta'$ (i.e. the radial
gradient of $\beta$) on the magnetic equilibrium was also included, which was
found to significantly reduce momentum transport. Including these two competing
effects broadens the rotation profile, but leaves the on-axis value of the
rotation roughly unchanged. Consequently, the shape of the $\beta$ profile has
a significant effect on the rotation profile of an up-down asymmetric tokamak.

$\textit{Fermi}$ Large Area Telescope (LAT), and scale this luminosity function
to the stellar masses of 30 dSphs to estimate the cumulative emission from

ultra-faint dSphs, including targets with the largest J-factors, is typically
several orders of magnitude lower, suggesting that these targets will remain
clean targets for indirect DM searches in the foreseeable future. For a DM
particle of mass 25~GeV annihilating to $b$ quarks at the thermal relic cross
section (consistent with DM interpretations of the Galactic Center excess), we
find that the expected $\gamma$-ray emission due to DM exceeds that of MSPs in

nature still remains elusive. We investigate the possibility that this
transient behaviour is due to the same thermal/viscous instability which is
responsible for outbursts of bright soft X-ray transients, occurring in
ultracompact binaries for adequately low mass-transfer rates. More generally,
we investigate the observational consequences of this instability when it
occurs in ultracompact binaries. We use our code for modelling the
thermal-viscous instability of the accretion disc, assumed here to be hydrogen
poor. We also take into account the effects of disc X-ray irradiation, and
consider the impact of the mass-transfer rate on the outburst brightness. We
find that one can reproduce the observed properties of both the very faint and
the brighter short transients (peak luminosity, duration, recurrence times),
provided that the viscosity parameter in quiescence is slightly smaller
(typically a factor of between two and four) than in bright soft X-ray
transients and normal dwarf nova outbursts, the viscosity in outburst being
unchanged. This possibly reflects the impact of chemical composition on
non-ideal MHD effects affecting magnetically driven turbulence in poorly
ionized discs.

is observed near the the spin reorientation transition at $H_{R}$=12.75 T,

paramagnetic state occurs. Special focus is given to the longitudinal
configuration, where both electric and heat current are parallel to the applied
field. The validity of the Fermi-liquid $T^2$ dependence of the resistivity
through $H_R$ demonstrates clearly that no quantum critical point occurs at
$H_R$. Thus the ferromagnetic transition line at $H_R$ becomes first order
implying the existence of a tricritical point at finite temperature. The
enhancement of magnetic fluctuations in the vicinity of the tricritical point
stimulates the reentrance of superconductivity. The abrupt sign change observed
in the thermoelectric power with the thermal gradient applied along the b axis

macroscopic evidence that in addition a significant change of the Fermi surface

  Geometric/Statistical Interpretation of Aharonov's Weak Value","149 pages, 2 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that the joint behaviour of an arbitrary pair of quantum observables
can be described by quasi-probabilities, which are extensions of the standard
probabilities used for describing the behaviour of a single observable. The
physical situations that require these quasi-probabilities arise when one
considers quantum measurement of an observable conditioned by some other
variable, with the notable example being the weak measurement employed to
obtain Aharonov's weak value. Specifically, we present a general prescription
for the construction of quasi-joint-probability (QJP) distributions associated
with a given pair of observables. These QJP distributions are introduced in two
complementary approaches: one from a bottom-up, strictly operational
construction realised by examining the mathematical framework of the
conditioned measurement scheme, and the other from a top-down viewpoint
realised by applying the results of spectral theorem for normal operators and
its Fourier transforms. It is then revealed that, for a pair of simultaneously
measurable observables, the QJP distribution reduces to their unique standard
joint-probability distribution, whereas for a non-commuting pair there exists
an inherent indefiniteness in the choice, admitting a multitude of candidates
that may equally be used for describing their joint behaviour. In the course of
our argument, we find that the QJP distributions furnish the space of operators
with their characteristic geometric structures such that the orthogonal
projections and inner products of observables can, respectively, be given
statistical interpretations as `conditionings' and `correlations'. The weak
value $A_{w}$ for an observable $A$ is then given a geometric/statistical
interpretation as either the orthogonal projection of $A$ onto the subspace
generated by another observable $B$, or equivalently, as the conditioning of
$A$ given $B$.

distributions, we propose two new flexible and efficient k-means-like

temporally evolving cluster structure from streaming data. Both algorithms
naturally respect the geometry of directional data, which lies on the unit

HAN can efficiently capture video temporal structures in a longer range; (2)
HAN is able to reveal temporal transitions between frame chunks with different
time steps, i.e. it explicitly models the temporal transitions between frames
as well as video segments and (3) with a multiple step spatial temporal
attention mechanism, HAN automatically learns important regions in video frames

latter are replaced by continuous line-segments of appropriate length) that has
been introduced by the first author. On such a metric graph, the GFF is a
random continuous function that generalises one-dimensional Brownian bridges so
that one-dimensional techniques can be used.
  In the present paper, we define and study the pseudo-metric defined on the
metric graph (and therefore also on the discrete graph itself), where the
length of a path on the metric graph is defined to be the local time at level
zero accumulated by the Gaussian free field along this path.
  We first derive a pathwise transformation that relates the GFF on the metric
graph with the reflected GFF on the metric graph via the pseudo-distance
defined by the latter. This is a generalisation of Paul L\'evy's result
relating the local time at zero of Brownian motion to the supremum of another
Brownian motion. We also compute explicitly the distribution of certain
functionals of this pseudo-metric and of the GFF. In particular, we point out
that when the boundary consists of just two points, the law of the
pseudo-distance between them depends solely on the resistance of the network
between them.
  We then discuss questions related to the scaling limit of this pseudo-metric
in the two-dimensional case, which should be the conformally invariant way to
measure distances between CLE(4) loops introduced and studied by the second
author with Wu, and by Sheffield, Watson and Wu. Our explicit laws on metric
graphs also lead to new conjectures for related functionals of the continuum
GFF on fairly general Riemann surfaces.

However, in the region of fields below 1 Tesla, we observe another set of
oscillation, with the period and the phase identical to those of microwave
induced resistance oscillations. The phenomenon of microwave induced
capacitance oscillations is explained in terms of violation of the Einstein
relation between conductivity and the diffusion coefficient in the presence of
microwaves, which leads to a dependence of the capacitor charging on the
anomalous conductivity. We also observe microwave-induced oscillations in the
capacitive response to periodic variations of external heating. These

Radio Astrophysical Observatory were studied through analysis and measurement
in order to provide absolute calibration of a survey of polarized emission from
the entire northern sky from 1280 to 1750 MHz, and to understand the
polarization performance of the telescope. Electromagnetic simulators CST and
GRASP-10 were used to compute radiation patterns of the telescope in all Stokes
parameters, and aperture efficiency. Aperture efficiency was also evaluated
using geometrical optics and was measured using Cyg A. Measured aperture
efficiency varied smoothly with frequency between values of 0.49 and 0.54;
GRASP-10 yielded values 6.5% higher but with closely similar variation with
frequency. Overall error across the frequency band is 3%, but values at any two
frequencies are relatively correct to ~1%. Dominant influences on aperture
efficiency are illumination taper of the feed radiation pattern and shadowing
by the feed-support struts. A model of ground emission was developed based on
measurements and on empirical data from remote sensing of the Earth from
satellite-borne telescopes. This model was convolved with the computed antenna
response to estimate conversion of ground emission into spurious polarized
signal. The computed spurious signal is comparable to measured values, but is
not accurate enough to be used to correct observations. A simpler model, in
which the ground is considered as an unpolarized emitter with a brightness

the Euler equations. These equations are invariant under Galileian
transformations, which constitute a global symmetry. With the introduction of
an appropriate generalized Coriolis force, these equations become symmetric
under general coordinate transformations.
  We show how exterior calculus simplifies dramatically the derivation of
conservation laws. We also discuss the advantage of an exterior calculus
formulation with respect to symmetry-preserving discretizations of the

  C-plane/U-plane Split Architecture",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The unrelenting increase in the population of mobile users and their traffic
demands drive cellular network operators to densify their network
infrastructure. Network densification shrinks the footprint of base stations
(BSs) and reduces the number of users associated with each BS, leading to an
improved spatial frequency reuse and spectral efficiency, and thus, higher
network capacity. However, the densification gain come at the expense of higher
handover rates and network control overhead. Hence, users mobility can diminish
or even nullifies the foreseen densification gain. In this context, splitting
the control plane (C-plane) and user plane (U-plane) is proposed as a potential
solution to harvest densification gain with reduced cost in terms of handover
rate and network control overhead. In this article, we use stochastic geometry
to develop a tractable mobility-aware model for a two-tier downlink cellular
network with ultra-dense small cells and C-plane/U-plane split architecture.
The developed model is then used to quantify the effect of mobility on the
foreseen densification gain with and without C-plane/U-plane split. To this
end, we shed light on the handover problem in dense cellular environments, show
scenarios where the network fails to support certain mobility profiles, and
obtain network design insights.

experimental high energy frontier. Using the analyses of the 750\,GeV diphoton
resonance as a case study, we examine the methodology currently employed by the
experimental analyses in estimating the dominant standard model backgrounds. We
assess the dependence of the significance associated with the excess on the
background modeling. In particular, we show that close to the high energy tails
of the distributions, estimates of the jet faking backgrounds relying on
functional extrapolations or Monte Carlo estimates of the challenging
photon-jet contributions introduce a large uncertainty. Analyses with loose
photon cuts, low photon $p_T$ cuts and those susceptible to high photon
rapidity regions are especially affected. Given that diphoton-based searches
beyond 1\,TeV are highly motivated as discovery modes, these considerations are
relevant and applicable in the future.
  We first consider a physics-driven deformation of the shape of the diphoton
faking photon-jet spectrum by next-to-leading order effects combined with a
rapidity and transverse momentum dependent fake rate. We show that the
resulting local significance of the excess is reduced due to such a
deformation. Then using a simple, but more general, ansatz to modify the
contribution of the jet faking backgrounds at high invariant masses but keeping
the inclusive and differential sample purities within experimental uncertainty
estimates, we demonstrate that the originally reported local 750\,GeV excess
significances could have been overestimated by more than one standard
deviation. We furthermore cross-check our analysis by comparing fit results
based on the smaller 2015 and the larger 2016 LHC datasets. Finally we employ
our methodology on the complete 13\,TeV LHC dataset to asses the systematics
involved in the current diphoton searches beyond the TeV region.

clusters (GCs) and are found in similar environments. A large sample of UCDs
and GCs around NGC 1399, the central giant elliptical of the Fornax galaxy
cluster, is used to infer their formation history and also that of NGC 1399. We
assumed that all GCs and UCDs in our sample are star clusters (SCs) and used
them as tracers of past star formation activities. After correcting our GC/UCD
sample for mass loss, we interpreted their overall mass function to be a
superposition of SC populations that formed coevally during different times.
The SC masses of each population were distributed according to the embedded
cluster mass function (ECMF), a pure power law with the slope $-\beta$ and a
stellar upper mass limit, $M_{\mathrm{max}}$, which depended on the star
formation rate (SFR). We decomposed the observed GC/UCD mass function into
individual SC populations and converted $M_{\mathrm{max}}$ of each SC
population to an SFR. The overall distribution of SFRs reveals how the GC/UCD
sample formed. Considering the age of the GCs/UCDs and the present stellar mass
of NGC 1399, we found that the formation of the GCs/UCDs can be well explained
for $\beta<2.3$. This agrees very well with the observation in young SCs where
$\beta\approx2.0$ is usually found. Even if taking into account that some of
the most massive objects might not be genuine SCs and applying different
corrections for the mass loss, the outcome is not influenced much. We found
peak SFRs between approximately 300 and 3000 $M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which
matches the SFRs observed in massive high-$z$ sub-mm galaxies and an SFR
estimate inferred from NGC 1399 based on ""downsizing"", i.e. more massive
galaxies must have formed over shorter times. Our results suggest that NGC 1399
and its GC/UCD system formed in an early, short, and intense starburst.

colliders such as the LHC. Our original motivation for this study came from the
possibility of a new heavy particle of mass ~ TeV decaying significantly into
two photons at colliders, such as LHC, but our analysis applies more broadly.
We show that there are significant constraints from astrophysics and cosmology
on the simplest UV complete models that incorporate such new particles and its
associated collider signal. The simplest and most obvious UV complete model
that incorporates such signals is that it arises from a new singlet scalar (or
pseudo-scalar) coupled to a new electrically charged and colored heavy fermion.
Here we show that these new fermions (and anti-fermions) would be produced in
the early universe, then form new color singlet heavy mesons with light quarks,
obtain a non-negligible freeze-out abundance, and remain in kinetic equilibrium
until decoupling. These heavy mesons possess interesting phenomenology,
dependent on their charge, including forming new bound states with electrons
and protons. We show that a significant number of these heavy states would
survive for the age of the universe and an appreciable number would eventually
be contained within the earth and solar system. We show that this leads to
detectable consequences, including the production of highly energetic events
from annihilations on earth, new spectral lines, and, spectacularly, the
destabilization of stars. The lack of detection of these consequences rules out
such simple UV completions, putting pressure on the viability of such new
particles at LHC. To incorporate such a scalar would require either much more
complicated UV completions or even further new physics that provides a decay
channel for the associated fermion.

prone to missing data, which can ultimately affect the decision of whether an

outcome data are handled in RCT-based CEAs, complementing a previous review
(covering 2003-2009, 88 articles) with a new systematic review (2009-2015, 81

description of the missing data, the statistical methods used to deal with
them, and the quality of the judgement underpinning the choice of these
methods. Second, we provide guidelines on how the information about missingness
and related methods should be presented to improve the reporting and handling
of missing data. Our review shows that missing data in within-RCT CEAs are
still often inadequately handled and the overall level of information provided
to support the chosen methods is rarely satisfactory.

One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the
neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the
distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training
cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the
summed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces
the training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch
normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to
apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch
normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used
for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a
single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its
own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before
the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs
exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also
straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the
normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is
very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks.
Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the
training time compared with previously published techniques.

M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. We find the average SFRs to increase by almost a factor
10 from $z\sim0.5$ to $z\sim3$, mirroring the rise in the comoving SFR density
over the same epoch. However, we find that the SFRs remain approximately
constant with increasing accretion luminosity for accretion luminosities above
10$^{12}$ L$_{\odot}$. We also find that the SFRs do not correlate with black
hole mass. Both of these results are most plausibly explained by the existence
of a self-regulation process by the starburst at high SFRs, which controls SFRs
on time-scales comparable to or shorter than the AGN or starburst duty cycles.
We additionally find that SFRs do not depend on Eddington ratio at any
redshift, consistent with no relation between SFR and black hole growth rate
per unit black hole mass. Finally, we find that high-ionisation broad
absorption line (HiBAL) quasars have indistinguishable far-infrared properties
to those of classical quasars, consistent with HiBAL quasars being normal

direct probes of spin in 2DESs were demonstrated two decades ago, the valley
quantum number has only been probed indirectly in semiconductor quantum wells,
graphene mono- and bilayers, and transition-metal dichalcogenides. Here, we
present the first direct experimental measurement of valley polarization in a
two dimensional electron system, effected via the direct mapping of the valley
quantum number onto the layer polarization in bilayer graphene at high magnetic

electric field-tuned phase transitions between states of different valley,
spin, and orbital polarization. Our data can be fit by a model that captures
both single particle and interaction induced orbital, valley, and spin
anisotropies, providing the most complete model of this complex system to date.
Among the newly discovered phases are theoretically unanticipated orbitally
polarized states stabilized by skew interlayer hopping. The resulting roadmap
to symmetry breaking in bilayer graphene paves the way for deterministic
engineering of fractional quantum Hall states, while our layer-resolved

0.72$ at $2\sigma$). These results are in agreement with constraints from the
EROS-II microlensing survey of brighter resolved stars, where we find
$f_v=(0.9\pm0.1)$ at $1\sigma$. Our fiducial model of a disk with scale length
2.6kpc, and a bulge with a low dark matter fraction of 12%, agrees with both
the revised MOA-II and EROS-II microlensing data. The required baryonic
fractions, and the resultant low contribution from dark matter, are consistent
with the NFW profiles produced by dissipationless cosmological simulations in
Milky Way mass galaxies. They are also consistent with recent prescriptions for
the mild adiabatic contraction of Milky Way mass haloes without the need for
strong feedback, but there is some tension with recent measurements of the
local dark matter density. Microlensing optical depths from the larger OGLE-III
sample could improve these constraints further when available.

confirmed via serendipitous detection of up to nine emission lines. Our
ultra-high-spatial resolution data reveal that about half of the star formation
in each of these starbursts is dominated by a single compact clump (FWHM size
of $\sim 350 \, {\rm pc}$). This structure is confirmed by independent datasets
at $920 \, {\rm \mu m}$ and $1.2 \, {\rm mm}$. The star-formation rate (SFR)
surface densities of all these clumps are extremely high, $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}
\sim 1200$ to $\sim 3000 \, {M_\odot \, {\rm yr}^{-1} \, {\rm kpc}^{-2}}$, the
highest found in high-redshift galaxies. There is a small probability that A-1

amplified by the blazar host. If this was the case, the effective radius of the
source would be $R_{\rm eff} \sim 40 \, {\rm pc}$, and the de-magnified SFR
surface density would be $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} \sim 10000 \, {M_\odot \, {\rm

Despite being unable to rule out an AGN contribution, our results suggest that
a significant percentage of the enormous far-IR luminosity in some dusty
starbursts is concentrated in very small star-forming regions. The high
$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ in our pair of SMGs could only be measured thanks to the
ultra-high-resolution ALMA observations used in this work, demonstrating that
long-baseline observations are essential to study and interpret the properties

located at the galaxy's photocentre, which is likely associated with the
low-luminosity AGN previously detected in NGC5419. Both the HST and SINFONI

velocity dispersion of $\sigma \sim 350$ km/s. In the region where the double
nucleus is located, the dispersion rises steeply to a peak value of $\sim 420$
km/s. In addition to the SINFONI data, we also obtained stellar kinematics at
larger radii from the South African Large Telescope. While NGC5419 shows low
rotation ($v < 50$ km/s), the central regions (inside $\sim 4 \, r_b$) clearly

M$_{\rm BH}=7.2^{+2.7}_{-1.9} \times 10^9$ M$_{\odot}$. The enhanced velocity
dispersion in the region of the double nucleus suggests that NGC5419 possibly
hosts two supermassive black holes at its centre, separated by only $\approx

expected from the size of the galaxy's depleted stellar core. This suggests,
that systematic uncertainties in M$_{\rm BH}$ related to the secondary nucleus

galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshift, recent studies have proposed models in
which AGN contribute significantly to the z > 4 H I ionizing background. In
some models, AGN are even the chief sources of reionization. If correct, these
models would make necessary a complete revision to the standard view that
galaxies dominated the high-redshift ionizing background. It has been suggested
that AGN-dominated models can better account for two recent observations that
appear to be in conflict with the standard view: (1) large opacity variations
in the z ~ 5.5 H I Lyman-alpha forest, and (2) slow evolution in the mean
opacity of the He II Lyman-alpha forest. Large spatial fluctuations in the
ionizing background from the brightness and rarity of AGN may account for the
former, while the earlier onset of He II reionization in these models may
account for the latter. Here we show that models in which AGN emissions source
>~ 50 % of the ionizing background generally provide a better fit to the
observed H I Lyman-alpha forest opacity variations compared to standard
galaxy-dominated models. However, we argue that these AGN-dominated models are
in tension with constraints on the thermal history of the intergalactic medium
(IGM). Under standard assumptions about the spectra of AGN, we show that the
earlier onset of He II reionization heats up the IGM well above recent
temperature measurements. We further argue that the slower evolution of the
mean opacity of the He II Lyman-alpha forest relative to simulations may
reflect deficiencies in current simulations rather than favor AGN-dominated
models as has been suggested.

the NLO+NLL corrections improve the dilepton bounds on the $Z^{\prime}$ mass

predicts in-plane anisotropy. For a more realistic Rashba model with finite

equations, and amenability to be implemented in common numerical schemes.
Specifically, our formulation uses three second-order equations of the
displacement field and nine auxiliary equations, along with the three time
histories of the displacement field. The properties of the PML, which are
controlled by a complex two-parameter stretch function, are such that it acts
as near perfect absorber. Using finite element method (FEM) 3D numerical
results are presented for a highly anisotropic medium. An extension of the
formulation to the particular case of a Kelvin-Vogit viscoelastic medium is
also presented.

for the 9 brightest Galactic dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) derived from their
stellar velocity dispersions and half-light radii. Tidal stripping plays an
important role by gradually removing dark matter from the outside in, affecting
in particular fainter satellites and systems of larger-than-average size for
their luminosity. Our models suggest that tides have significantly reduced the
dark matter content of Can Ven I, Sextans, Carina, and Fornax, a prediction
that may be tested by comparing them with field galaxies of matching luminosity
and size. Uncertainties in observational estimates of the dark matter content
of individual dwarfs have been underestimated in the past, at times
substantially. We use our improved estimates to revisit the `too-big-to-fail'
problem highlighted in earlier N-body work. We reinforce and extend our
previous conclusion that the APOSTLE simulations show no sign of this problem.
The resolution does not require `cores' in the dark mass profiles, but, rather,
relies on revising assumptions and uncertainties in the interpretation of
observational data and accounting for `baryon effects' in the theoretical
modelling.

pulsed emission from the Vela pulsar down to tens of GeV, making this the
second pulsar detected by a ground-based Cherenkov telescope. Deep upper limits
have also been obtained by VERITAS and MAGIC for the Geminga pulsar. We will
review the latest developments in VHE pulsar science, including an overview of
the latest observations, refinements, and extensions to radiation models and

naturally explain the ionization deficits observed in many LABs: Their Ly-alpha

resonantly scattering Ly-alpha photons. High Ly-alpha luminosities do not
require currently powerful AGN, independent of obscuration. Chandra X-ray data
reveal intrinsically weak AGN, confirming the luminous optical nebulae as
impressive ionization echoes. For the first time, we also report mid-infrared

smooth spheres, mergers, spectacular outflows and ionization cones. Because of

giants. In our sample, the LSPs range from 479 to 2967 days, and are on average
8.1 +/- 1.3 times the pulsation period. There is no evidence for more than one
LSP in each star. In stars with both the fundamental and first overtone radial
period present, the LSP is more often about 10 times the latter. The visual
amplitudes of the LSPs are typically 0.1 magnitude and do not correlate with
the LSP. The phase curves tend to be sinusoidal, but at least two are sawtooth.
The LSPs are stable, within their errors, over the timespan of our data, which
is typically 25,000 days. The amplitudes, however, vary by up to a factor of
two or more on a timescale of roughly 20-30 LSPs. There is no obvious
difference between the behavior of the carbon (C) stars and the normal oxygen
(M) stars. Previous multicolor photoelectric observations showed that the LSP
color variations are similar to those of the pulsation period, and of the LSPs
in the Magellanic Clouds, and not like those of eclipsing stars. We note that
the LSPs are similar to the estimated rotation periods of the stars, though the
latter have large uncertainties. This suggests that the LSP phenomenon may be a
form of modulated rotational variability.

invaluable in informing hardware design, providing pipeline prototypes, and

PARAS based on observations of bright RV standard stars, and describe the
evolution of the data reduction and RV analysis pipeline as instrument
characterization progresses and we gather longer baselines of data. Secondly,
we discuss how our experience with PARAS is a critical component in the

Several methods have been proposed to mitigate stellar signals in RV

of these methods.
  The goal of the RV fitting challenge is to generate simulated RV data
including stellar and planetary signals and to perform a blind test within the
community to test the efficiency of the different methods proposed to recover
planetary signals despite stellar signals.
  In this first paper, we describe the simulation used to model the
measurements of the RV fitting challenge. Each simulated planetary system
includes the signals from instrumental noise, stellar oscillations,
granulation, supergranulation, stellar activity, and observed and simulated
planetary systems. In addition to RV variations, this simulation also models
the effects of instrumental noise and stellar signals on activity observables

RHESSI spectra, yielding the temperature of the differential emission measure
(DEM) tail, the nonthermal power law slope and flux, and the thermal/nonthermal

low-energy cutoff, and (ii) using the low-energy cutoff $e_{\mathrm{wt}}$
predicted by the warm thick-target bremsstrahlung model of Kontar et al. {\bf
Based on a mean temperature of $T_e=8.6$ MK in active regions we find
low-energy cutoff energies of $e_{\mathrm{wt}} =6.2\pm 1.6$ keV for the
warm-target model, which is significantly lower than the cross-over energies
$e_{\mathrm{co}}=21 \pm 6$ keV. Comparing with the statistics of magnetically
dissipated energies $E_{\mathrm{mag}}$ and thermal energies $E_{\mathrm{th}}$
from the two previous studies, we find the following mean (logarithmic) energy
ratios with the warm-target model: $E_{\mathrm{nt}} = 0.41 \ E_{\mathrm{mag}}$,
$E_{\mathrm{th}} = 0.08 \ E_{\mathrm{mag}}$, and $E_{\mathrm{th}} = 0.15 \

energy in 95% and the nonthermal energy in 71% of the flare events, which
confirms that magnetic reconnection processes are sufficient to explain flare

detailed characterization of already known directly imaged exoplanets. The
typical adaptive optics (AO) Nyquist control region for ELTs is ~0.4
arcseconds, placing many already known directly imaged planets outside the DM
control region and not allowing any standard wavefront control scheme to remove
speckles that would allow higher SNR images/spectra to be acquired. This can be
fixed with super-Nyquist wavefront control (SNWFC), using a sine wave phase
plate to allow for wavefront control outside the central DM Nyquist region. We
demonstrate that SNWFC is feasible through a simple, deterministic,
non-coronagraphic, super-Nyquist speckle nulling technique in the adaptive
optics laboratory at the National Research Council of Canada. We also present
results in simulation of how SNWFC using the self coherent camera (SCC) can be
used for high contrast imaging. This technique could be implemented on future
high contrast imaging instruments to improve contrast outside the standard
central dark hole for higher SNR characterization of exoplanets.

containing few interacting electrons in an applied magnetic field are found to
be very different from those in a conventional semiconductor system, such as a
GaAs ring. The strong Zeeman and Coulomb interaction of the ZnO system, exert a
profound influence on the electron states and on the optical properties of the
ring. In particular, our results indicate that the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect in
a ZnO quantum ring strongly depends on the electron number. In fact, for two
electrons in the ZnO ring, the AB oscillations become aperiodic, while for
three electrons (interacting) the AB oscillations completely disappear.
Therefore, unlike in conventional quantum ring topology, here the AB effect
(and the resulting persistent current) can be controlled by varying the
electron number.

""quantum flutter"" [Mathy, Zvonarev, Demler, Nat. Phys. 2012]. We discuss
revivals in the momentum of the impurity, which have been seen before but not

revivals are caused by disjoint sets of eigenstate transitions, and this fact
is used to interpret some of their aspects. This attribution of momentum
features to different eigenstate subsets allows quantitative reproduction of
these features with much less computational expense than has so far been
possible. Finally some results on the distribution of the momentum of
eigenstates and their relation to the momentum of the impurity once the system
has been thermalised are presented along with a discussion on the time averaged
infinite time value of the momentum and its comparison to different eigenstate

the control are usually more difficult to study than the the ones when the
delay appears only in the state. This is particularly true when we look at the
associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Indeed, even in the
simplified setting (introduced first by Vinter and Kwong for the deterministic
case) the HJB equation is an infinite dimensional second order semilinear
Partial Differential Equation (PDE) that does not satisfy the so-called
""structure condition"" which substantially means that the control can act on the
system modifying its dynamics at most along the same directions along which the
noise acts.
  The absence of such condition, together with the lack of smoothing properties
which is a common feature of problems with delay, prevents the use of the known
techniques (based on Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) or on
the smoothing properties of the linear part) to prove the existence of regular
solutions of this HJB equation and so no results on this direction have been
proved till now.
  In this paper we provide a result on existence of regular solutions of such
kind of HJB equations. This opens the road to prove existence of optimal
feedback controls, a task that will be accomplished in a companion paper. The
main tool used is a partial smoothing property that we prove for the transition
semigroup associated to the uncontrolled problem. Such results hold for a
specific class of equations and data which arises naturally in many applied
problems.

termed ""shortcuts to adiabaticity"" (STA) aims to remedy this vulnerability by
designing fast dynamics to reproduce the results of slow, adiabatic evolutions.
Here, we implement a novel STA technique known as ""superadiabatic
transitionless driving"" (SATD) to speed up stimulated Raman adiabatic passage
(STIRAP) in a solid-state lambda ({\Lambda}) system. Utilizing optical
transitions to a dissipative excited state in the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center

trajectories for population transfer and for the initialization and transfer of
coherent superpositions. We reveal that SATD protocols exhibit robustness to
dissipation and experimental uncertainty, and can be optimized when these
effects are present. These results motivate STA as a promising tool for
controlling open quantum systems comprising individual or hybrid
nanomechanical, superconducting, and photonic elements in the solid state.

scheme to preserve quantum entanglement between two and three distant qubits,
each of which interacts with a dissipative reservoir independently. At the long
time limit, we obtained analytical expressions for the coherence measure and
the concurrence of two and three qubits in terms of the number of additional
qubits. It is observed that, by increasing the number of additional qubits in
each reservoir, the initial coherence and the respective entanglements are
completely protected in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes.
Interestingly, the protection of entanglements occurs even under the
individually different behaviors of the reservoirs.

The motivation comes from settings where agents have uncertainty about their
own values for using a resource, and where it is in the interest of a group
that resources be used and not wasted. Done in the right way, improved
utilization maximizes social welfare--- balancing the utility of a high value
but unreliable agent with the group's preference that resources be used. We
introduce the family of contingent payment mechanisms (CP), which may charge an
agent contingent on use (a penalty). A CP mechanism is parameterized by a
maximum penalty, and has a dominant-strategy equilibrium. Under a set of
axiomatic properties, we establish welfare-optimality for the special case
CP(W), with CP instantiated for a maximum penalty equal to societal value W for
utilization. CP(W) is not dominated for expected welfare by any other
mechanism, and second, amongst mechanisms that always allocate the resource and
have a simple indirect structure, CP(W) strictly dominates every other
mechanism. The special case with no upper bound on penalty, the contingent
second-price mechanism, maximizes utilization. We extend the mechanisms to
assign multiple, heterogeneous resources, and present a simulation study of the
welfare properties of these mechanisms.

  In this paper, we describe two examples where planners and analysts used (or

to draw their own conclusions regarding the effects that would likely emerge
from proposed actions taken by the international mission.
  The key idea, in both of our examples, is a continuous cycle of anticipations

outcomes guide the next increment of computational estimates. With a proper
methodology, PMESII modeling tools can offer valuable insights and encourage

and zeros of the function coincide with the operator spectrum. By allowing the
direct manipulation of individual eigenspaces of nonnormal and
nondiagonalizable operators, the new theory avoids spurious divergences. As
such, it yields novel insights and closed-form expressions across several areas
of physics in which nondiagonalizable dynamics are relevant, including
memoryful stochastic processes, open non unitary quantum systems, and
far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics.
  The technical contributions include the first full treatment of arbitrary
powers of an operator. In particular, we show that the Drazin inverse,
previously only defined axiomatically, can be derived as the negative-one power
of singular operators within the meromorphic functional calculus and we give a
general method to construct it. We provide new formulae for constructing
projection operators and delineate the relations between projection operators,
eigenvectors, and generalized eigenvectors.
  By way of illustrating its application, we explore several, rather distinct
examples.

is not concentrated on a great subsphere is the surface area measure of some
convex body, and, moreover, the surface area measure determines a convex body
uniquely.
  In this manuscript we prove an extension of Minkowski's theorem. Consider a
measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with positive degree of concavity and positive
degree of homogeneity. We show that a surface area measure of a convex set $K$,
weighted with respect to $\mu$, determines a convex body uniquely up to
$\mu$-measure zero. We also establish an existence result under natural
conditions including symmetry.
  We apply this result to extend the solution to classical Shephard's problem,
which asks the following: if one convex body in $\mathbb{R}^n$ has larger
projections than another convex body in every direction, does it mean that the
volume of the first convex body is also greater? The answer to this question is
affirmative when $n\leq 2$ and negative when $n\geq 3.$
  In this paper we introduce a new notion which relates projections of convex
bodies to a given measure $\mu$, and is a direct generalization of the Lebesgue
area of a projection. Using this notion we state a generalization of the
Shephard problem to measures and prove that the answer is affirmative for
$n\leq 2$ and negative for $n\geq 3$ for measures which have a positive degree
of homogeneity and a positive degree of concavity. We also prove stability and
separation results, and establish useful corollaries. Finally, we describe two
types of uniqueness results which follow from the extension of Minkowski's
theorem.

categorized as prediction-based and count-based methods according to the

extensively analyzed and evaluated in recent studies, but there is relatively
less work continuing the line of research to develop an enhanced learning

addition, the interpretation of the learned word representations still remains
somewhat opaque. Motivated by the observations and considering the pressing
need, this paper presents a novel method for learning the word representations,
which not only inherits the advantages of classic word embedding methods but
also offers a clearer and more rigorous interpretation of the learned word

  statistical learning problems",,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most high-dimensional estimation and prediction methods propose to minimize a
cost function (empirical risk) that is written as a sum of losses associated to
each data point. In this paper we focus on the case of non-convex losses, which
is practically important but still poorly understood. Classical empirical
process theory implies uniform convergence of the empirical risk to the
population risk. While uniform convergence implies consistency of the resulting
M-estimator, it does not ensure that the latter can be computed efficiently.
  In order to capture the complexity of computing M-estimators, we propose to
study the landscape of the empirical risk, namely its stationary points and
their properties. We establish uniform convergence of the gradient and Hessian
of the empirical risk to their population counterparts, as soon as the number
of samples becomes larger than the number of unknown parameters (modulo
logarithmic factors). Consequently, good properties of the population risk can
be carried to the empirical risk, and we can establish one-to-one
correspondence of their stationary points. We demonstrate that in several
problems such as non-convex binary classification, robust regression, and
Gaussian mixture model, this result implies a complete characterization of the
landscape of the empirical risk, and of the convergence properties of descent
algorithms.
  We extend our analysis to the very high-dimensional setting in which the
number of parameters exceeds the number of samples, and provide a
characterization of the empirical risk landscape under a nearly
information-theoretically minimal condition. Namely, if the number of samples
exceeds the sparsity of the unknown parameters vector (modulo logarithmic
factors), then a suitable uniform convergence result takes place. We apply this
result to non-convex binary classification and robust regression in very
high-dimension.

Kondo insulating behaviour observed in the valence fluctuating compound
CeFe2Al10 with a paramagnetic ground state down to 50 mK. We are investigating
this family of compounds, both in polycrystalline and single crystal form,
using inelastic neutron scattering to understand the role of anisotropic c-f
hybridization on the spin gap formation as well as on their magnetic
properties. We have observed a clear sign of a spin gap in all three compounds
from our polycrystalline study as well as the existence of a spin gap above the
magnetic ordering temperature in T=Ru and Os. Our inelastic neutron scattering
studies on single crystals of CeRu2Al10 and CeOs2Al10 revealed dispersive
gapped spin wave excitations below TN. Analysis of the spin wave spectrum
reveals the presence of strong anisotropic exchange, along the c-axis (or
z-axis) stronger than in the ab-plane. These anisotropic exchange interactions
force the magnetic moment to align along the c-axis, competing with the single
ion crystal field anisotropy, which prefers moments along the a-axis. In the

data processing and analytic jobs on clusters. This paper compares and
contrasts the features of HPC and Big Data schedulers with a focus on
accommodating both scientific computing and high performance data analytic
workloads. Job latency is critical for the efficient utilization of scalable
computing infrastructures, and this paper presents the results of job launch
benchmarking of several current schedulers: Slurm, Son of Grid Engine, Mesos,
and Yarn. We find that all of these schedulers have low utilization for
short-running jobs. Furthermore, employing multilevel scheduling significantly
improves the utilization across all schedulers.

functions attached to special cycles on Shimura varieties of orthogonal and
unitary type. These functions play a key role in the arithmetic geometry of the
special cycles in the context of Kudla's program.
  In particular, we show that the generating series obtained by taking the
differences of the two families of Green functions is a modular form with
trivial holomorphic projection. Along the way, we construct a section of the
Maass lowering operator for moderate growth modular forms valued in the Weil
representation using a regularized theta lift, which may be of independent
interest. We also consider arithmetic-geometric applications to integral models
of U(n, 1) Shimura varieties.
  Each family of Green functions gives rise to a formal arithmetic theta
function, valued in an arithmetic Chow group, that is conjectured to be
modular; our main result is the modularity of the difference of the two
arithmetic theta functions. Finally, we relate the arithmetic heights of the
special cycles to special derivatives of Eisenstein series, as predicted by
Kudla's conjecture, and describe a refinement of a theorem of
Bruinier-Howard-Yang on arithmetic intersections against CM points.

boson discovery. The searches for the lightest stop have put strong constraints
on its mass. However, there is still a search gap in the low mass region if the
spectrum of the stop and the lightest neutralino is compressed. In that case,
it may be easier to look for the second stop since naturalness requires both
stops to be close to the weak scale. The current experimental searches for the
second stop are based on the simplified model approach with the decay modes
$\tilde{t}_2 \to \tilde{t}_1 Z$ and $\tilde{t}_2 \to \tilde{t}_1 h$. However,
in a realistic supersymmetric spectrum there is always a sbottom lighter than
the second stop, hence the decay patterns are usually more complicated than the
simplified model assumptions. In particular, there are often large branching
ratios of the decays $\tilde{t}_2 \to \tilde{b}_1 W$ and $\tilde{b}_1 \to
\tilde{t}_1 W$ as long as they are open. The decay chains can be even more
complex if there are intermediate states of additional charginos and
neutralinos in the decays. By studying several MSSM benchmark models at the 14
TeV LHC, we point out the importance of the multi-$W$ final states in the
second stop and the sbottom searches, such as the same-sign dilepton and
multilepton signals, aside from the traditional search modes. The observed
same-sign dilepton excesses at LHC Run 1 and Run 2 may be explained by some of
our benchmark models. We also suggest that the vector boson tagging and a new
kinematic variable may help to suppress the backgrounds and increase the signal
significance for some search channels. Due to the complex decay patterns and
lack of the dominant decay channels, the best reaches likely require a
combination of various search channels at the LHC for the second stop and the
lightest sbottom.

In order to implement this task, the computer should be able to identify the

relationship type between event pairs, time pairs or event-time pairs. Specific
Problem: It is important to accurately identify the relationship type between
combinations of event and time before the temporal ordering of events can be
defined. The machine learning approach taken in Mani et. al (2006) provides an
accuracy of only 62.5 on the baseline data from TimeBank. The researchers used
maximum entropy classifier in their methodology. TimeML uses the TLINK
annotation to tag a relationship type between events and time. The time
complexity is quadratic when it comes to tagging documents with TLINK using
human annotation. This research proposes using decision tree and parsing to
improve the relationship type tagging. This research attempts to solve the gaps
in human annotation by automating the task of relationship type tagging in an
attempt to improve the accuracy of event and time relationship in annotated
documents. Scope information: The documents from the domain of news will be
used. The tagging will be performed within the same document and not across
documents. The relationship types will be identified only for a pair of event
and time and not a chain of events. The research focuses on documents tagged
using the TimeML specification which contains tags such as EVENT, TLINK, and

Although, at the current stage, there is no obvious indication whether the

of this mild excess by exploiting the strong entanglement between the
associated Higgs production with a single top quark ($thX$) and $t\bar t h$
production in the presence of anomalous top-Yukawa coupling. As well known,
$t\bar t h$ production only depends on the absolute value of the top-Yukawa
coupling. Meanwhile, in $thX$ production, this degeneracy is lifted through the
strong interference between the two main contributions which are proportional
to the top-Yukawa and the gauge-Higgs couplings, respectively. Especially, when
the relative sign of the top-Yukawa coupling with respect to the gauge-Higgs
coupling is reversed, the $thX$ cross section can be enhanced by more than one
order of magnitude. We perform a detailed study of the influence of $thX$
production on $t\bar{t}h $ production in the presence of the anomalous

the coupling of the nucleon spin to its orbital motion, whereas
non-relativistic SCMF methods necessitate a phenomenological ansatz for the
effective spin-orbit potential. Recent experimental studies aim to explore the
isospin properties of the effective spin-orbit interaction in nuclei. SCMF
models are very useful in the interpretation of the corresponding data, however
standard relativistic mean-field and non-relativistic Hartree-Fock models use
effective spin-orbit potentials with different isovector properties, mainly
because exchange contributions are not treated explicitly in the former. The
impact of exchange terms on the effective spin-orbit potential in relativistic
mean-field models is analysed, and it is shown that it leads to an isovector
structure similar to the one used in standard non-relativistic Hartree-Fock.
Data on the isospin dependence of spin-orbit splittings in spherical nuclei
could be used to constrain the isovector-scalar channel of relativistic
mean-field models. The reproduction of the empirical kink in the isotope shifts
of even Pb nuclei by relativistic effective interactions points to the
occurrence of pseudospin symmetry in the single-neutron spectra in these
nuclei.

significantly better results for stimulation and novelty measures than the

  Time-Consistent Control",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is concerned with the open-loop time-consistent solution of
time-inconsistent mean-field stochastic linear-quadratic optimal control.
Different from standard stochastic linear-quadratic problems, both the system
matrices and the weighting matrices are dependent on the initial times, and the
conditional expectations of the control and state enter quadratically into the
cost functional. Such features will ruin Bellman's principle of optimality and
result in the time-inconsistency of the optimal control. Based on the dynamical
nature of the systems involved, a kind of open-loop time-consistent equilibrium
control is investigated in this paper. It is shown that the existence of
open-loop time-consistent equilibrium control for a fixed initial pair is
equivalent to the solvability of a set of forward-backward stochastic
difference equations with stationary conditions and convexity conditions. By
decoupling the forward-backward stochastic difference equations, necessary and
sufficient conditions in terms of linear difference equations and generalized
difference Riccati equations are given for the existence of open-loop
time-consistent equilibrium control with a fixed initial pair. Moreover, the
existence of open-loop time-consistent equilibrium control for all the initial
pairs is shown to be equivalent to the solvability of a set of coupled
constrained generalized difference Riccati equations and two sets of
constrained linear difference equations.

simulations of gas accretion onto the seeds of binary stars to investigate
their short-term evolution. Our simulation setup is more realistic compared to
the previous works by taking into account of dynamically evolving envelope with
non-uniform distribution of gas density and angular momentum of accreting flow.
Our initial condition includes a seed binary and a surrounding gas envelope,
modelling the phase of core collapse of gas cloud when the fragmentation has
already occurred. We assume that the seed binary has no eccentricity and no
growth by gas accretion. The envelope is assumed to be an isothermal gas with
no self-gravity. We run multiple simulations with different values of initial
mass ratio $q_0$ (the ratio of secondary over primary mass) and gas
temperature, and find a critical value of $q_{\rm c} = 0.25$ which
distinguishes the later evolution of mass ratio $q$ as a function of time. If
$q_0$ >~ $q_{\rm c}$, the secondary seed grows faster and $q$ increases
monotonically towards unity. If $q_0$ <~ $q_{\rm c}$, on the other hand, the
primary seed grows faster and $q$ is lower than $q_0$ at the end of the
simulation. Based on our numerical results, we analytically calculate the
long-term evolution of the seed binary including the growth of binary by gas
accretion. We find that the seed binary with $q_0$ >~ $q_{\rm c}$ evolves
towards an equal-mass binary star, and that with $q_0$ <~ $q_{\rm c}$ evolves
to a binary with an extreme value of $q$. Binary separation is a monotonically
increasing function of time for any $q_0$, suggesting that the binary growth by
accretion does not lead to the formation of close binaries.

find changes in the longitudinal and transverse voltages with magnetic field

Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) Green function calculations for Co monolayers and

whether the sum over magnetic dipole terms $T_{x}+T_{y}+T_{z}$ is zero and
whether the angular dependence of the \ta\ term goes as $3\cos^{2}\theta-1$. It
follows that there are circumstances when the influence of the SOC on
$T_{\alpha}$ cannot be neglected even for 3$d$ atoms, where the SOC is
nominally small. The crucial factor appears to be the dimensionality of the
system: for 3$d$ adatoms, the influence of SOC on $T_{\alpha}$ can be
significant while for monolayers it is always practically negligible. Apart
from the dimensionality, hybridization between adatom and substrate states is
also important: small hybridization enhances the importance of the SOC and vice

  FLARE will help addressing two of ESA's Cosmic Vision themes: a) ""How did the
universe originate and what is it made of?"" and b) ""What are the conditions for
planet formation and the emergence of life?"" and more specifically, ""From gas

second step, the temporary files are read again, split into $k$-mers and

Surprisingly, this inverse problem turns out to be well-posed assuming only a

the Fresnel number of the imaging setup. However, both for homogeneous objects,
characterized by a fixed ratio of the induced refractive phase shifts and
attenuation, and in the case of measurements at two distances, a much more
favorable algebraic dependence on the Fresnel number can be shown. In some
cases we establish order optimality of our estimates.

consideration, where the cosmological constant is dealt with as thermodynamic
pressure and the mass of black holes as thermodynamic enthalpy. We resort to a
newly introduced intensive thermodynamic variable, i.e., the coupling strength
of the scalar and tensor whose dimension is length square, and thus yield both
the generalized first law of thermodynamics and the generalized Smarr relation.
Our result indicates that this class of Horndeski black holes presents rich
thermodynamic behaviors and critical phenomena. Especially in the case of the
presence of an electric field, these black holes undergo two phase transitions.
Once the charge parameter exceeds its critical value, or the cosmological
parameter does not exceed its critical value, no phase transitions happen and
the black holes are stable. As a by-product, we point out that the coupling
strength acts as the thermodynamic pressure in the behavior of thermodynamics.

a scalar field $\phi$ having a phenomenologically chosen $X(z)$ can give rise
to a transition from a decelerated to an accelerated phase of expansion for the
universe. We have examined the possibility of constraining various cosmological
parameters (such as the deceleration parameter and the effective equation of
state parameter) by comparing our theoretical model with the latest Type Ia

5-Myr NGC 2264 cluster, that rotation plays a key role in the Lithium (Li)
depletion processes among low-mass stars. Fast rotators appear to be less
Li-depleted than equal-mass slow rotators. We intend to explore the existence
of a Li depletion - rotation connection among the beta Pictoris members at an
age of about 24 Myr, and to use such correlation either to confirm or to
improve the age estimate based on the Lithium Depletion Boundary (LDB)
modeling. We have photometrically monitored all the known members of the beta
Pictoris association with at least one Lithium equivalent width (Li EW)
measurement from the literature. We measured the rotation periods of 30 members
for the first time and retrieved from the literature the rotation periods for
other 36 members, building a catalogue of 66 members with measured rotation
period and Li EW. We find that in the 0.3 < M < 0.8 Msun range, there is a
strong correlation between rotation and Li EW. For higher mass stars, no
significant correlation is found. For very low mass stars in the Li depletion
onset, at about 0.1 Msun, data are too few to infer a significant correlation.
The observed Li EWs are compared with those predicted by the Dartmouth stellar
evolutionary models that incorporate the effects of magnetic fields. After
decorrelating the Li EW from the rotation period, we find that the hot side of
the LDB is fitted well by Li EW values corresponding to an age of 25$\pm$3 Myr
in good agreement with independent estimates from the literature.

region of the binary parameter space spanning the binary's mass-ratio
$q\sim1.00-1.75$ for different total masses and equations of state, and up to
$q\sim2$ for a stiff BNS system. We study the mass-ratio effect on the
gravitational waves (GWs) and on the possible electromagnetic emission
associated to dynamical mass ejecta. We compute waveforms, spectra, and
spectrograms of the GW strain including all the multipoles up to $l=4$. The
mass-ratio has a specific imprint on the GW multipoles in the
late-inspiral-merger signal, and it affects qualitatively the spectra of the
merger remnant. The multipole effect is also studied by considering the
dependency of the GW spectrograms on the source's sky location. Unequal mass
BNSs produce more ejecta than equal mass systems with ejecta masses and kinetic
energies depending almost linearly on $q$. We estimate luminosity peaks and
light curves of macronovae events associated to the mergers using a simple
approach. For $q\sim2$ the luminosity peak is delayed for several days and can
be up to four times larger than for the $q=1$ cases. The macronova emission
associated with the $q\sim2$ BNS is more persistent in time and could be
observed for weeks instead of few days ($q=1$) in the near infrared. Finally,
we estimate the flux of possible radio flares produced by the interaction of
relativistic outflows with the surrounding medium. Also in this case a large
$q$ can significantly enhance the emission and delay the peak luminosity.
Overall, our results indicate that BNS merger with large mass ratio have EM
signatures distinct from the equal mass case and more similar to black hole -
neutron star binaries.

generated by dynamo action in collisional and collisionless plasmas with and
without external forcing. A hierarchy of mathematical descriptions is
considered for the plasma dynamics: ideal MHD, visco-resistive MHD, the
double-adiabatic theory of Chew, Goldberger and Low (CGL), kinetic MHD, and
other kinetic models. It is found that dynamo action is greatly constrained in
models where the magnetic moment of any particle species is conserved. In the
absence of external forcing, the magnetic energy then remains small at all
times if it is small in the initial state. In other words, a small ""seed""
magnetic field cannot be amplified significantly, regardless of the nature of
flow, as long as the collision frequency and gyroradius are small enough to be
negligible. A similar conclusion also holds if the system is subject to
external forcing as long as this forcing conserves the magnetic moment of at
least one plasma species and does not greatly increase the total energy of the
plasma (i.e., in practice, is subsonic). Dynamo action therefore always
requires collisions or some small-scale kinetic mechanism for breaking the
adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment.

simulations of a chromatin fiber interacting with an ensemble of (multivalent)
DNA-binding proteins; these proteins switch between two states -- active
(binding) and inactive (non-binding). This system provides a model for any
DNA-binding protein that can be modified post-translationally to change its
affinity for DNA (e.g., like the phosphorylation of a transcription factor).
Due to this out-of-equilibrium process, proteins spontaneously assemble into
clusters of self-limiting size, as individual proteins in a cluster exchange
with the soluble pool with kinetics like those seen in photo-bleaching
experiments. This behavior contrasts sharply with that exhibited by
""equilibrium"", or non-switching, proteins that exist only in the binding state;
when these bind to DNA non-specifically, they form clusters that grow
indefinitely in size. Our results point to post-translational modification of
chromatin-bridging proteins as a generic mechanism driving the self-assembly of
highly dynamic, non-equilibrium, protein clusters with the properties of
nuclear bodies. Such active modification also reshapes intra-chromatin contacts
to give networks resembling those seen in topologically-associating domains, as
switching markedly favors local (short-range) contacts over distant ones.

geometric set cover (SC) problems admit a PTAS via local search -- this is one
of the most general approaches known for such problems. Their result applies if
a naturally defined ""exchange graph"" for two feasible solutions is planar and
is based on subdividing this graph via a planar separator theorem due to
Frederickson (1987). Obtaining similar results for the related maximum
k-coverage problem (MC) seems non-trivial due to the hard cardinality
constraint. In fact, while Badanidiyuru, Kleinberg, and Lee (2012) have shown
(via a different analysis) that local search yields a PTAS for two-dimensional
real halfspaces, they only conjectured that the same holds true for dimension
three. Interestingly, at this point it was already known that local search
provides a PTAS for the corresponding set cover case and this followed directly
from the approach of Mustafa and Ray.
  In this work we provide a way to address the above-mentioned issue. First, we
propose a color-balanced version of the planar separator theorem. The resulting
subdivision approximates locally in each part the global distribution of the
colors. Second, we show how this roughly balanced subdivision can be employed
in a more careful analysis to strictly obey the hard cardinality constraint.
More specifically, we obtain a PTAS for any ""planarizable"" instance of MC and
thus essentially for all cases where the corresponding SC instance can be
tackled via the approach of Mustafa and Ray. As a corollary, we confirm the
conjecture of Badanidiyuru, Kleinberg, and Lee regarding real half spaces in
dimension three. We feel that our ideas could also be helpful in other
geometric settings involving a cardinality constraint.

two new revolutionary theories, Quantum Mechanics (QM) and General Relativity

accurately predicting the results of experiments taking place at small length

However, despite the impressive predictive power of each theory in their
respective regimes, their unification still remains unresolved. Theories and
proposals for their unification exist but we are lacking experimental guidance

quantum effects become relevant is particularly problematic but recently there

that experimental techniques in quantum physics have developed rapidly in
recent years with the promise of quantum technologies. Here we review recent
advances in experimental and theoretical work on quantum experiments that will
be able to probe relativistic effects of gravity on quantum properties, playing
particular attention to the role of Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime

and refinement of simplified Dark Matter (DM) models. Based on two concrete
examples, we show how existing simplified DM models (SDMM) can be extended to
provide a more accurate and comprehensive framework to interpret and
characterise collider searches. In the first example we extend the canonical
SDMM with a scalar mediator to include mixing with the Higgs boson. We show
that this approach not only provides a better description of the underlying
kinematic properties that a complete model would possess, but also offers the
option of using this more realistic class of scalar mixing models to compare
and combine consistently searches based on different experimental signatures.
The second example outlines how a new physics signal observed in a visible
channel can be connected to DM by extending a simplified model including
effective couplings. This discovery scenario uses the recently observed excess
in the high-mass diphoton searches of ATLAS and CMS for a case study to show
that such a pragmatic approach can aid the experimental search programme to
verify/falsify a potential signal and to study its underlying nature. In the
next part of the White Paper we outline other interesting options for SDMM that
could be studied in more detail in the future. Finally, we discuss important
aspects of supersymmetric models for DM and how these could help to develop of
more complete SDMM.

essential role in the mechanism of insertion of the class of $\beta$-PFT.
However, in the class of $\alpha$-PFT like the actinoporins produced by sea
anemones, evidence of membrane-bound prepores is still lacking. We have
employed single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and atomic force
microscopy (AFM) to identify, for the first time, a prepore species of the

the heating and hydrodynamical properties of the flare, with detailed
observations presented in a previous paper. Long duration red-shifts of
transition region lines observed in this event, as well as many other events,
are fundamentally incompatible with chromospheric condensation on a single
loop. We combine RHESSI and IRIS data to measure the energy partition among the
many magnetic strands that comprise the flare. Using that observationally
determined energy partition, we show that a proper multi-threaded model can
reproduce these red-shifts in magnitude, duration, and line intensity, while
simultaneously being well constrained by the observed density, temperature, and
emission measure. We comment on the implications for both RHESSI and IRIS
observations of flares in general, namely that: (1) a single loop model is
inconsistent with long duration red-shifts, among other observables; (2) the
average time between energization of strands is less than 10 seconds, which
implies that for a hard X-ray burst lasting ten minutes, there were at least 60
strands within a single IRIS pixel located on the flare ribbon; (3) the
majority of these strands were explosively heated with energy distribution well
described by a power law of slope $\approx -1.6$; (4) the multi-stranded model
reproduces the observed line profiles, peak temperatures, differential emission

heliocentric path with an orbital period that matches almost exactly with that
of a host body (planetary or not). The trajectory is of such nature that,
without being gravitationally attached, the value of the angular separation
between host and quasi-satellite as seen from the Sun remains confined within
relatively narrow limits for time-spans that exceed the length of the host's
sidereal orbital period. Here, we show that under these conditions, a
quasi-satellite traces an analemma in the sky as observed from the host in a
manner similar to that found for geosynchronous orbits. The analemmatic curve
(figure-eight-, teardrop-, ellipse-shaped) results from the interplay between
the tilt of the rotational axis of the host and the properties of the orbit of
the quasi-satellite. The analemma criterion can be applied to identify true
quasi-satellite dynamical behaviour using observational or synthetic astrometry
and it is tested for several well-documented quasi-satellites. For the
particular case of 15810 (1994 JR1), a putative accidental quasi-satellite of
dwarf planet Pluto, we show explicitly that this object describes a complex
analemmatic curve for several Plutonian sidereal periods, confirming its
transient quasi-satellite status.

significant X-Ray, EUV and UV flux from Venus dark side. As a check we have
also analyzed a Mercury transit across the solar disk, observed with Hinode/XRT
in 2006. We have used the latest version of the Hinode/XRT Point Spread
Function (PSF) to deconvolve Venus and Mercury X-ray images, in order to remove
possible instrumental scattering. Even after deconvolution, the flux from Venus
shadow remains significant while in the case of Mercury it becomes negligible.
Since stray-light contamination affects the XRT Ti-poly filter data from the
Venus transit in 2012, we performed the same analysis with XRT Al-mesh filter
data, which is not affected by the light leak. Even the Al-mesh filter data
show residual flux. We have also found significant EUV (304 A, 193 A, 335 A)
and UV (1700 A) flux in Venus shadow, as measured with SDO/AIA. The EUV
emission from Venus dark side is reduced when appropriate deconvolution methods
are applied; the emission remains significant, however. The light curves of the
average flux of the shadow in the X-ray, EUV, and UV bands appear different as
Venus crosses the solar disk, but in any of them the flux is, at any time,
approximately proportional to the average flux in a ring surrounding Venus, and
therefore proportional to the average flux of the solar regions around Venus
obscuring disk line of sight. The proportionality factor depends on the band.
This phenomenon has no clear origin; we suggest it may be due to scatter
occurring in the very long magnetotail of Venus.

compared to the conventional insulating refrigerants. We also demonstrate that
the cooling performance is optimized in Yb$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$Co$_2$Zn$_{20}$ by
partial Sc substitution with $x\sim$0.19. The substitution induces chemical
pressure which drives the materials close to a zero-field quantum critical
point. This leads to an additional enhancement of the magnetocaloric effect in
low fields and low temperatures enabling final temperatures well below 100 mK.
Such performance has up to now been restricted to insulators. Since nearly a
century the same principle of using local magnetic moments has been applied for
adiabatic demagnetization cooling. This study opens new possibilities of using
itinerant magnetic moments for the cryogen-free refrigeration.

In order to investigate a future in which wind plants are geographically

generators. We simulate the wind power using anemometer data from nine
tall-tower sites spanning the contiguous United States. We find that the number
of low-power hours per year declines exponentially with the number of sites
being aggregated. Hours with power levels below 5% of total capacity, for
example, drop by a factor of about 60, from 2140 h/y for the median single site

deviations drops by a factor of 3. The systematic dependence of
generation-level probability distribution ""tails"" on both number and power

we find that the grain boundary becomes morphologically unstable due to the
combination of long-range elastic interaction between the grain boundary and
compositional domain boundaries, and shear-coupled grain boundary motion. We
characterize this instability analytically by extending the linear stability

network including gas-phase, gas-grain interactions and grain-surface chemistry
is used to evolve chemistry in time, for 1 Myr. Great diversity is observed in
the relative abundance ratios of the main considered species: H2O, CO, CO2,
CH4, O2, NH3 and N2. The choice of ionisation level, the choice of initial
abundances, as well as the extent of chemical reaction types included are all
factors that affect the chemical evolution. The only exception is the
inheritance scenario with a low ionisation level, which results in negligible
changes compared with the initial abundances, regardless of whether
grain-surface chemistry is included. The chemical processing changes the C/O
ratios for gas and ice significantly with radius and with model assumptions.
For high ionisation levels, chemical processing becomes significant after a few
times $10^{5}$~yrs. It is concluded that chemical evolution in the disk
midplane needs to be considered in the determination of the volatile
composition of planetesimals.

  We give polynomial time algorithms to compute feasibility of BL-datum, the
optimal BL-constant and a weak separation oracle for the BL-polytope. The same
result holds for the so-called Reverse BL inequalities of Barthe. The best
known algorithms for any of these tasks required at least exponential time.
  The algorithms are obtained by a simple efficient reduction of a given
BL-datum to an instance of the Operator Scaling problem defined by Gurvits, for
which the present authors have provided a polynomial time algorithm. This
reduction implies algorithmic versions of many of the known structural results,
and in some cases provide proofs that are different or simpler than existing

  Of particular interest is the fact that the operator scaling algorithm is
continuous in its input. Thus as a simple corollary of our reduction we obtain
explicit bounds on the magnitude and continuity of the BL-constant in terms of
the BL-data. To the best of our knowledge no such bounds were known, as past

determination of photon arrival time. It is a crucial performance parameter for
systems using superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). In
this work, we have demonstrated that the detection timing jitter is limited in
part by the spatial variation of photon detection events along the length of
the wire. This distribution causes the generated electrical pulses to arrive at
the readout at varied times. We define this jitter source as geometric jitter
since it is related to the length and area of the SNSPD. To characterize the
geometric jitter, we have constructed a novel differential cryogenic readout
with less than 7 ps of electronic jitter that can amplify the pulses generated
from the two ends of an SNSPD. By differencing the measured arrival times of
the two electrical pulses, we were able to partially cancel out the difference
of the propagation times and thus reduce the uncertainty of the photon arrival
time. Our experimental data indicates that the variation of the differential
propagation time was a few ps for a 3 {\mu}m x 3 {\mu}m device while it
increased up to 50 ps for a 20 {\mu}m x 20 {\mu}m device. In a 20 {\mu}m x 20
{\mu}m large SNSPD, we achieved a 20% reduction in the overall detection timing
jitter for detecting telecom-wavelength photons by using the differential
cryogenic readout. The geometric jitter hypothesis was further confirmed by
studying jitter in devices that consisted of long wires with 1-{\mu}m-long

that, as the solutions we compare are defined on different domains, the answer
is not an immediate consequence of $H^s$ well-posedness for the wave equation.
  We show how explicit solution formulae yield convergence and optimal

extended continuously as constants on $B_\varepsilon$ at each time. We
establish that for $s=2$ the solution $U$ can be realized as an $H^2$-limit
(uniformly in time) of exterior solutions on $\mathbb{R}^3\setminus

as $\varepsilon\downarrow 0$. Similarly for $s=1$: $U$ is then an $H^1$-limit

Conjecture from 1943 states that for every graph $G$, $h(G)\ge \chi(G)$, where

notably through the concepts of time reversal and wavefront shaping. Recently,
it was shown that spatial light modulators can counter-intuitively focus waves
both in space and time through multiple scattering media when illuminated with
optical pulses. In this letter we transpose the concept to a microwave cavity
using flat arrays of electronically tunable resonators. We prove that
maximizing the Green's function between two antennas at a chosen time yields
diffraction limited spatio-temporal focusing. Then, changing the photons' dwell
time inside the cavity, we modify the relative distribution of the spatial and
temporal degrees of freedom (DoF), and we demonstrate that it has no impact on
the field enhancement: wavefront shaping makes use of all available DoF,
irrespective of their spatial or temporal nature. Our results prove that
wavefront shaping using simple electronically reconfigurable arrays of
reflectors is a viable approach to the spatio-temporal control of microwaves,
with potential applications in medical imaging, therapy, telecommunications,
radar or sensing. They also offer new fundamental insights regarding the
coupling of spatial and temporal DoF in complex media.

and the terminate time of a sequence of jobs or tasks, as the time to traverse
a belt conveyor system, is well known as one of the most important criteria in
scheduling problems. It is often used by manufacturing firms in practice in
order to improve the operational efficiency with respect to the order of job
processing to be performed. It is known that the performance of a machine
depends on the particular timing of the job processing even if the job
processing order is fixed. That is, the performance of a system with respect to
flowshop processing depends on the procedure of scheduling. In this present
work, we first discuss the relationship between makespan and several scheduling
procedures in detail by using a small example and provide an algorithm for
deriving the makespan. Using our proposed algorithm, several numerical
experiments are examined so as to reveal the relationship between the typical
behavior of makespan and the position of the fiducial machine, with respect to
several distinguished distributions of the processing time. We also discuss the
behavior of makespan by using the properties of the shape functions used in the
context of percolation theory. Our contributions are firstly giving a detail
discussion on the universality of makespan in flowshop problems and obtaining
several novel properties of makespan, as follows: (1) makespan possesses
universality in the sense of being little affected by a change in the
probability distribution of the processing time, (2) makespan can be decomposed
into the sum of two shape functions, and (3) makespan is less affected by the
dispatching rule than by the scheduling procedure.

body are experimentally studied in a wind-tunnel through high-frequency wall
pressure probes mapping the rear of the model and a horizontal 2D velocity
field. The barycenters of the pressure distribution over the rear part of the
model and the intensity recirculation are found highly correlated. Both
described the most energetic large-scale structures dynamics, confirming the
relation between the large-scale recirculation bubble and its wall pressure
foot-print. Focusing on the pressure, its barycenter trajectory has a
stochastic behavior but its low frequencies dynamics exhibit the same
characteristics as a weak strange chaotic attractor system, with two well
defined attractors. The low frequencies dynamics associated to the large-scale
structures are then analyzed. The largest Lyapunov exponent is first estimated,
leading to a low positive value characteristic of strange attractors and weak
chaotic systems. Afterwards, analyzing the autocorrelation function of the
time-series, we compute the correlation dimension, larger than two. The signal
is finally transformed and analyzed as a telegraph signal showing that its
dynamics correspond to a quasi-random telegraph signal. This is the first
demonstration that the low frequencies dynamics of a turbulent 3D wake are not
a purely stochastic process but rather a weak chaotic process exhibiting
strange attractors. From the flow-control point of view, it also opens the path
to more simple closed-loop flow control strategies aiming at the stabilization
of the wake and the control of the dynamics of the wake barycenter.

$\bar{\eta}\lVert\nabla u_{,t}\rVert^{2}$ and free micro-inertia terms
$\eta\lVert p_{,t}\rVert^{2}$ is investigated to unveil their respective effect
on the dynamical behavior of band-gap metamaterials. We show that the term
$\bar{\eta}\lVert\nabla u_{,t}\rVert^{2}$ alone is only able to disclose
relatively simplified dispersive behaviors. On the other hand, the term
$\eta\lVert p_{,t}\rVert^{2}$ is in charge of the description of the full
complex behavior of band-gap metamaterials. A suitable mixing of the two
micro-inertia terms allows to describe a new feature of the
relaxed-micromorphic model, i.e. the description of a second band-gap occurring
for higher frequencies. We also show that a split of the gradient micro-inertia
$\bar{\eta}\lVert\nabla u_{,t}\rVert^{2}$, in the sense of Cartan-Lie
decomposition of matrices, allows to flatten separately longitudinal and
transverse optic branches thus giving the possibility of a second band-gap.
Finally, we investigate the effect of the gradient inertia
$\bar{\eta}\lVert\nabla u_{,t}\rVert^{2}$ on more classical enriched models as
the Mindlin-Eringen and the internal variable ones. We find that the addition
of such gradient micro-inertia allows for the onset of one band-gap in the
Mindlin-Eringen model and of three band-gaps in the internal variable model. In
this last case, however, non-local effects cannot be accounted for which is a
too drastic simplification for most metamaterials. We conclude that, even when
adding gradient micro-inertia terms, the relaxed micromorphic model remains the
most performing one, among the considered enriched model, for the description
of non-local band-gap metamaterials.
