  extrapolation techniques and embeddings","Only slight changes with respect to v2",,,,"math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We prove that operators satisfying the hypotheses of the extrapolation
theorem for Muckenhoupt weights are bounded on weighted Morrey spaces. As a
consequence, we obtain at once a number of results that have been proved
individually for many operators. On the other hand, our theorems provide a
variety of new results even for the unweighted case because we do not use any
representation formula or pointwise bound of the operator as was assumed by
previous authors. To extend the operators to Morrey spaces we show different
(continuous) embeddings of (weighted) Morrey spaces into appropriate
Muckenhoupt $A_1$ weighted $L_p$ spaces, which enable us to define the
operators on the considered Morrey spaces by restriction. In this way, we can
avoid the delicate problem of the definition of the operator, often ignored by
the authors. In dealing with the extension problem through the embeddings
(instead of using duality) one is neither restricted in the parameter range of
the $p$'s (in particular $p=1$ is admissible and applies to weak-type
inequalities) nor the operator has to be linear. Another remarkable consequence
of our results is that vector-valued inequalities in Morrey spaces are
automatically deduced. On the other hand, we also obtain $A_\infty$-weighted
inequalities with Morrey quasinorms.

polarization parameters, that it is an intrinsically polarized source (>20%)
with a varying polarization angle as it approaches Sgr A* position. DSO shows a
near-infrared excess of K_s-L' > 3 that remains compact close to the pericenter
of its orbit. Its observed parameters and the significant polarization obtained
in this work show that the DSO might be a dust-enshrouded young star, forming a
bow shock as it approaches the super massive black hole. The significantly high
measured polarization degree indicates that it has a non-spherical geometry and
it can be modelled as a combination of a bow shock with a bipolar wind of the
star. We use a 3D radiative transfer model that can reproduce the observed
properties of the source such as the total flux density and the polarization
degree. We obtain that the change of the polarization angle can be due to an
intrinsic change in the source structure. Accretion disc precession of the
young star in the gravitational field of the black hole can lead to the change
of the bipolar outflow and therefore the polarization angle variation. It might
also be the result of the source interaction with the ambient medium.

the observable-mass scaling relations and the X-ray luminosity-temperature

the slope of these scaling relations and the evolution of their normalization

for a sample of hot clusters with core-excised temperatures
$k_{\rm{B}}T\geq5\,\rm{keV}$ the normalization and slope of the observable-mass

exception is the temperature-mass relation, for which the increased importance
of non-thermal pressure support and biased X-ray temperatures leads to a
greater departure from self-similarity in the hottest systems. As a
consequence, these also affect the slope and evolution of the normalization in
the luminosity-temperature relation. The median hot gas profiles show good
agreement with observational data at $z=0$ and $z=1$, with their evolution
again departing significantly from the self-similar prediction. However,
selecting a hot sample of clusters yields profiles that evolve significantly

analogue to the moving boundary method for the pure LB solver. The key
ingredients in our method are mass and charge conservation for the solute
species and a partial-volume smoothing of the solute fluxes to minimize
discretization artifacts. We demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness by
simulating the electrophoresis of charged spheres in an external field; for a
single sphere we compare to the equivalent electro-osmotic (co-moving) problem.

itself is associated with a conditional distribution $p(z|x)$ represented by
samples $\{z_i\}_{i=1}^M$, and the goal is to learn a function $f$ that links
these conditional distributions to target values $y$. These learning problems
become very challenging when we only have limited samples or in the extreme

approaches either assume that $z$ is independent of $x$, or require an
overwhelmingly large samples from each conditional distribution.

With such new reformulation, we only need to deal with the joint distribution

on the very useful cryogenic range [4 K - 15 K]. The knowledge of these
temperature coefficients would allow to further design either quartz
temperature sensors or conversely frequency-temperature compensated quartz
cuts. With extremely low losses, lower than $10^{-9}$ for the best ones, key
applications of such devices are ultra-low loss mechanical systems used in many
research areas including frequency control and fundamental measurements. The
Eulerian formalism is used in this study to identify the temperature
coefficients.

electron behavior and a standard example of spontaneously broken rotational

The scattering of conduction electrons from thermal perturbations to this spin
order, together with electron-electron collisions, mark the material electrical
behavior at low temperatures, where the resistivity varies mostly quadratically
with the temperature. Around liquid-helium temperatures however, an interesting
phenomenon occurs, giving rise to an extra \emph{linear} contribution to the
variation of the electrical resistivity with temperature, whose theoretical
explanation has encountered problems for a long time. Here I introduce a
spin-flip scattering mechanism of conduction electrons in ferromagnetic metals
arising from their interaction with the internal magnetic induction and
mediated by chiral modes of the crystal lattice vibrations carrying spin 1.
This mechanism is able to explain the above anomaly and give a good account of
the spin-lattice relaxation times of iron, cobalt and nickel at room

precise amount of time, using a classical clock. A fully quantum mechanical
description of such a device would include a quantum description of the clock
whose state is generally disturbed because of the back-reaction on it. Such a
description is needed if we wish to consider finite sized autonomous quantum
machines requiring no external control. The extent of the back-reaction has
implications on how small the device can be, on the length of time the device
can run, and is required if we want to understand what a fully quantum

implementation of a unitary by a finite sized device which we call the
""Quasi-Ideal clock"", and show that the back-reaction on it can be made
exponentially small in the device's dimension with only a linear increase in
energy. As a result, an autonomous quantum machine need only be of modest size
and or energy. We are also able to solve a long-standing open problem by using
a finite sized quantum clock to approximate the continuous evolution of an
Idealised clock. The result has implications on the equivalence of different

equation. Numerical schemes such as Euler and Gear, typically used by
SPICE-based circuit simulators do not yield the expected outcome when solving
the Stratonovich s-LLGS equation. While the trapezoidal method in SPICE does
solve for the Stratonovich solution, its accuracy is limited by the minimum
time step of integration in SPICE. We implement the s-LLGS equation in both its
cartesian and spherical coordinates form in SPICE and compare the stability and

eigenvalue problems when perturbing off of the linear limit permits us to
obtain explicit expressions for the eigenvalues of each of the states

displays a phase transition that can be either first or second-order, depending
on the amplitude of the field and on the frequency of oscillation. Within this
approximation the entropy production rate is shown to have a discontinuity when
the transition is first-order and to be continuous, with a jump in its first
derivative, if the transition is second-order. In two dimensions, we find with
numerical simulations that the critical behavior of the entropy production rate
is the same, independent of the frequency and amplitude of the field. Its first
derivative has a logarithmic divergence at the critical point. This result is
in agreement with the lack of a first-order phase transition in two dimensions.
We analyze a model with a field that changes at stochastic time-intervals
between two values. This model allows for an informational theoretic
interpretation, with the system as a sensor that follows the external field. We
calculate numerically a lower bound on the learning rate, which quantifies how
much information the system obtains about the field. Its first derivative with

The two first authors contributed equally",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Continuous word representations, trained on large unlabeled corpora are
useful for many natural language processing tasks. Popular models that learn
such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct
vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large
vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach
based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of
character $n$-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character
$n$-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our
method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us
to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training
data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on
word similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed
morphological word representations, we show that our vectors achieve
state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.

allowing only small deviations from unity. Such small deviations $\Delta\rho$
originate exclusively from quantum effects with special sensitivity to mass
splittings between different isospin components of fermions and scalars. In
this paper the dominant two-loop electroweak corrections to $\Delta\rho$ are
calculated in the $CP$-conserving THDM, resulting from the top-Yukawa coupling
and the self-couplings of the Higgs bosons in the gauge-less limit. The
on-shell renormalization scheme is applied. With the assumption that one of the
$CP$-even neutral scalars represents the scalar boson observed by the LHC
experiments, with standard properties, the two-loop non-standard contributions
in $\Delta\rho$ can be separated from the standard ones. These contributions
are of particular interest since they increase with mass splittings between
non-standard Higgs bosons and can be additionally enhanced by $\tan\beta$ and
$\lambda_5$, an additional free coefficient of the Higgs potential, and can
thus modify the one-loop result substantially. Numerical results are given for
the dependence on the various non-standard parameters, and the influence on the
calculation of electroweak precision observables is discussed.

episodes of $\gamma$-ray emission were recently reported in at least two
systems: Cyg X-1 and Cyg X-3. The identification of additional
$\gamma$-ray-emitting microquasars is required to better understand how
$\gamma$-ray emission can be produced in these systems. Theoretical models have
predicted very high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray emission from microquasars during
periods of transient outburst. Observations reported herein were undertaken
with the objective of observing a broadband flaring event in the $\gamma$-ray
and X-ray bands. Contemporaneous observations of three microquasars, GRS
1915+105, Circinus X-1, and V4641 Sgr, were obtained using the High Energy
Spectroscopic System (H.E.S.S.) telescope array and the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer (RXTE) satellite. X-ray analyses for each microquasar were performed
and VHE $\gamma$-ray upper limits from contemporaneous H.E.S.S. observations
were derived. No significant $\gamma$-ray signal has been detected in any of
the three systems. The integral $\gamma$-ray photon flux at the observational
epochs is constrained to be $I(> 560 {\rm\ GeV}) < 7.3\times10^{-13}$ cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$, $I(> 560 {\rm\ GeV}) < 1.2\times10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, and

Circinus X-1, and V4641 Sgr, respectively. The $\gamma$-ray upper limits
obtained using H.E.S.S. are examined in the context of previous Cherenkov
telescope observations of microquasars. The effect of intrinsic absorption is
modelled for each target and found to have negligible impact on the flux of
escaping $\gamma$-rays. When combined with the X-ray behaviour observed using
RXTE, the derived results indicate that if detectable VHE $\gamma$-ray emission
from microquasars is commonplace, then it is likely to be highly transient.

Guided policy search methods provide asymptotic local convergence guarantees by
construction, but it is not clear how much the policy improves within a small,

be interpreted as an approximate variant of mirror descent, where the
projection onto the constraint manifold is not exact. We derive a new guided
policy search algorithm that is simpler and provides appealing improvement and
convergence guarantees in simplified convex and linear settings, and show that
in the more general nonlinear setting, the error in the projection step can be
bounded. We provide empirical results on several simulated robotic navigation

including efficient and cost-effective solid oxide fuel cells, gas separation
membranes, oxygen sensors, chemical looping devices, and memristors. Strain is
often proposed as a method to enhance the performance of oxygen transport
materials, but the magnitude of its effect and its underlying mechanisms are
not well-understood, particularly in the widely-used perovskite-structured
oxygen conductors. This work reports on an ab initio prediction of strain
effects on migration energetics for nine perovskite systems of the form LaBO3,
where B = [Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Ga]. Biaxial strain, as might be
easily produced in epitaxial systems, is predicted to lead to approximately
linear changes in migration energy. We find that tensile biaxial strain reduces
the oxygen vacancy migration barrier across the systems studied by an average
of 66 meV per percent strain for a single selected hop, with a low of 36 and a
high of 89 meV decrease in migration barrier per percent strain across all
systems. The estimated range for the change in migration barrier within each
system is approximately 25 meV per percent strain when considering all hops.
These results suggest that strain can significantly impact transport in these
materials, e.g., a 2% tensile strain can increase the diffusion coefficient by
about three orders of magnitude at 300 K (one order of magnitude at 500 {\deg}C
or 773 K) for one of the most strain-responsive materials calculated here
(LaCrO3). We show that a simple elasticity model, which assumes only dilative
or compressive strain in a cubic environment and a fixed migration volume, can
qualitatively but not quantitatively model the strain dependence of the
migration energy, suggesting that factors not captured by continuum elasticity
play a significant role in the strain response.

We focus in the following physical situation: two qubits ($q_A$ and $q_B$) are
initially in a maximally entangled state. One of them ($q_B$) interacts with a

performed in each of the qubits of $R$, in a basis that is chosen after
independent optimization procedures: maximization of the visibility, the
concurrence and the predictability. For a specific maximization procedure, we
study in details how each of the complementary quantities behave, conditioned
on the intensity of the coupling between $q_B$ and the $N$ qubits. We show
that, if the coupling is sufficiently ""strong"", independent of the maximization
procedure, the concurrence tends to decay quickly. Interestingly enough, the
behavior of the concurrence in this model is similar to the entanglement
dynamics of a two qubit system subjected to a thermal reservoir, despite that
we consider finite $N$. However the visibility shows a different behavior: its
maximization is more efficient for stronger coupling constants. Moreover, we
investigate how the distinguishability, or the information stored in different

skutterudite $Ce_{1-x}Gd_{x}Fe_{4}P_{12}$ ($x \approx 0.001$), at temperatures
where the host resistivity manifests a smooth insulator-metal crossover,
provides evidence of the underlying Kondo physics associated with this system.
At low temperatures (below $T \approx K$), $Ce_{1-x}Gd_{x}Fe_{4}P_{12}$ behaves
as a Kondo-insulator with a relatively large hybridization gap, and the
$Gd^{3+}$ ESR spectra displays a fine structure with lorentzian line shape,
typical of insulating media. The electronic gap is attributed to the large
hybridization present in the coherent regime of a Kondo lattice, when Ce
4f-electrons cooperate with band properties at half-filling. Mean-field
calculations suggest that the electron-phonon interaction is fundamental at
explaining the strong 4f-electron hybridization in this filled skutterudite.
The resulting electronic structure is strongly temperature dependent, and at
about $T^{*} \approx 160 K$ the system undergoes an insulator-to-metal
transition induced by the withdrawal of 4f-electrons from the Fermi volume, the
system becoming metallic and non-magnetic. The $Gd^{3+}$ ESR fine structure
coalesces into a single dysonian resonance, as in metals. Still, our
simulations suggest that exchange-narrowing via the usual Korringa mechanism,
alone, is not capable of describing the thermal behavior of the ESR spectra in
the entire temperature region ($4.2$ - $300$ K). We propose that temperature
activated fluctuating-valence of the Ce ions is the missing ingredient that,
added to the usual exchange-narrowing mechanism, fully describes this unique
temperature dependence of the $Gd^{3+}$ ESR fine structure observed in
$Ce_{1-x}Gd_{x}Fe_{4}P_{12}$.

with an increasing fraction of connected percolated free volume, or
water-accessible open space, in the membrane polymer structure. This free
volume is enhanced by the dynamic structure of the membrane at the molecular
level as it swells when hydrated and vibrates due to molecular collisions
allowing a continuous path connecting the opposite membrane surfaces. The
tortuous paths available for transport of solutes result in Brownian motion of
solute molecules and hopping from pore to pore as they pass through the polymer
network structure of the membrane. The transport of alcohol solutes decreases
for solutes with larger Van der Waals volume, which corresponds to less
available percolated free volume, or solute-accessible space, within the
membrane polymer structure. However, the Van der Waals size of the dehydrated
solutes is generally not a good measure to predict solute transport or
rejection. Urea has reduced transport compared to ethanol, most likely due to
more complex chemistry, even though urea has a smaller Van der Waals volume
than ethanol. Na+ and Cl- experience the lowest transport, likely due to strong

demonstrate that tradeoffs between aggressiveness and defensiveness (i.e.,
targeting adversaries vs. targeting like-minded individuals) creates
paradoxical behaviour such as non-transitive dynamics. And while there is an
optimal strategy in a two competitor system, three competitor systems have no

outcome of a competition, even if the extreme strategies have no chance of
winning. Not only are these results reminiscent of classic paradoxical results
from evolutionary game theory, but the structure of social networks created by

social structure can act as a measurable metric for social games which in turn
allows us to provide a game theoretical perspective on online political

taken from the posterior probability distribution of catalogs consistent with
an observed photon count map. In order to validate our method we sample random

published a decade ago (1.6-1.8) and our index $R_V$=2.50$\pm$0.04 also differs
from them, but in very good agreement with recent works based on deep surveys
in the inner Galaxy. As a consequence, the total extinction $A_{Ks}$=0.74$ \pm
$0.08 ($A_V$=11.40$ \pm$ 2.40) is substantially smaller than previous
results(0.91-1.13), part of which ($A_{Ks}$=0.63 or $A_V$=9.66) is from the
ISM. The extinction in front of the cluster spans a range of $\Delta
A_V\sim$8.7\,mag with a gradient increasing from SW to NE across the cluster
face, following the same general trend of warm dust distribution. The map of
the $J-Ks$ colour index also shows a trend of reddening in this direction. We
measured the equivalent width of the diffuse interstellar band at 8620 $\AA$
(the ""GAIA DIB"") for Wd 1 cluster members and derived the relation
$A_{Ks}$=0.612 $EW$ $-$ 0.191 $EW^2$. This extends the Munari et al. (2008)

embedded in a class of two Higgs doublets models (2HDM) with a discrete $Z_2$
symmetry, which couples the ""heavy"" scalar doublet only to the 4th generation
fermions and the ""light"" one to the Standard Model (SM) fermions - the
so-called 4G2HDM introduced by us several years ago. We study the constraints
imposed on the 4G2HDM from direct searches of heavy fermions, from precision
electroweak data (PEWD) and from the measured production and decay signals of
the 125 GeV scalar, which in the 4G2HDM corresponds to the lightest CP-even
scalar h. We then show that the recently reported excess in the $\gamma\gamma$
spectrum around 750 GeV can be accommodated by the heavy CP-even scalar of the
4G2HDM, H, resulting in a unique choice of parameter space: negligible mixing
(sin\alpha ~ O(0.001)) between the two CP-even scalars h,H and heavy 4th
generation quark and lepton masses m_t',m_b' < 400 GeV and $m_{\nu'},m_{\tau'}$
> 900 GeV, respectively. Whether or not the 750 GeV \gamma \gamma resonance is
confirmed, interesting phenomenology emerges in q' - Higgs systems (q'=t',b'),
that can be searched for at the LHC. For example, the heavy scalar states of
the model, S=H,A,H^+, may have BR(S -> q'q') ~ O(1), giving rise to observable
q'q' signals on resonance, followed by the flavor changing q' decays t'->uh
(u=u,c) and/or b'->dh (d=d,s,b). This leads to distinct high jet-multiplicity
signatures, with or without charged leptons, of the form q'q' -> (nj + mb +
lW)_S (j and b being light and b-quark jets, respectively), with n+m+l =6-8 and
unique kinematic features. It is also shown that the 4G2HDM can easily
accommodate the interesting recent indications of a percent-level branching
ratio in the lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) decay $h \to \tau \mu$ of the 125
GeV Higgs, if confirmed.

quantitative comparison between predictions and observations of arc abundance.
Several algorithms have been proposed to this end, but machine learning methods
have remained as a relatively unexplored step in the arc finding process. In
this work we introduce a new arc finder based on pattern recognition, which
uses a set of morphological measurements derived from the Mediatrix
Filamentation Method as entries to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). We show
a full example of the application of the arc finder, first training and
validating the ANN on simulated arcs and then applying the code on four Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) images of strong lensing systems. The simulated arcs use
simple prescriptions for the lens and the source, while mimicking HST
observational conditions. We also consider a sample of objects from HST images
with no arcs in the training of the ANN classification. We use the training and
validation process to determine a suitable set of ANN configurations, including
the combination of inputs from the Mediatrix method, so as to maximize the
completeness while keeping the false positives low. In the simulations the
method was able to achieve a completeness of about 90% with respect to the arcs
that are input to the ANN after a preselection. However, this completeness
drops to $\sim$ 70% on the HST images. The false detections are of the order of
3% of the objects detected in these images. The combination of Mediatrix
measurements with an ANN is a promising tool for the pattern recognition phase
of arc finding. More realistic simulations and a larger set of real systems are
needed for a better training and assessment of the efficiency of the method.

train a recurrent neural network that takes as input sequences of
pseudo-labeled frames and optimizes an objective that encourages both accuracy
on the target frame and consistency across consecutive frames. The approach
incorporates strong supervision of target frames, weak-supervision on context
frames, and regularization via a smoothness penalty. Our approach achieves mean

in complex evolutionary and ecological dynamics: experiments show successive
selective sweeps of favorable mutations as well as long-term coexistence of
multiple clonal strains. The mechanisms underlying either coexistence or
fixation of several competing strains have rarely been studied altogether.
Conditions for coexistence have mostly been studied by population and community
ecology, while rates of invasion and fixation have mostly been studied by
population genetics. In order to provide a global understanding of the
complexity of the dynamics observed in large clonal populations, we develop a
stochastic model where three clones compete. Competitive interactions can be
intransitive and we suppose that strains enter the population via mutations or
rare immigrations. We first describe all possible final states of the
population, including stable coexistence of two or three strains, or the
fixation of a single strain. Second, we give estimate of the invasion and
fixation times of a favorable mutant (or immigrant) entering the population in
a single copy. We show that invasion and fixation can be slower or faster when
considering complex competitive interactions. Third, we explore the parameter
space assuming prior distributions of reproduction, death and competitive rates
and we estimate the likelihood of the possible dynamics. We show that when
mutations can affect competitive interactions, even slightly, stable
coexistence is likely. We discuss our results in the context of the

irregular satellites of Jupiter and 1787 positions for the largest irregular
satellite of Saturn, Phoebe. These observations were made between 1995 and 2014
and have an estimated error of about 60 to 80 mas. Based on this set of
positions, we derived new orbits for the eight largest irregular satellites of
Jupiter: Himalia, Elara, Pasiphae, Carme, Lysithea, Sinope, Ananke and Leda.
For Phoebe we updated the ephemeris from Desmars et al. (2013) using 75% more
positions than the previous one. Due to their orbital characteristics, it is
common belief that the irregular satellites were captured by the giant planets
in the early Solar System, but there is no consensus for a single model
explaining where they were formed. Size, shape, albedo and composition would
help to trace back their true origin, but these physical parameters are yet
poorly known for irregular satellites. The observation of stellar occultations
would allow for the determination of such parameters. Indeed Jupiter will cross
the galactic plane in 2019-2020 and Saturn in 2018, improving a lot the chances
of observing such events in the near future. Using the derived ephemerides and
the UCAC4 catalogue we managed to identify 5442 candidate stellar occultations
between January 2016 and December 2020 for the 9 satellites studied here. We
discussed how the successful observation of a stellar occultation by these
objects is possible and present some potential occultations.

functional perturbation theory calculations. In addition to the phonon anomaly
at the transversal optical (TO) phonon branch in the K point for pristine

behavior corresponds to the emergence of a Kohn anomaly, as a consequence of a

strained graphene contrast with the commonly assumed view that the e-ph

stellar mass in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We compare the
clustering of samples using 12 different methods for estimating stellar mass,
isolating the method that has the smallest scatter at fixed halo mass. In this
test, the stellar mass estimate with the smallest errors yields the highest
amplitude of clustering at fixed number density. We find that the PCA stellar
masses of Chen etal (2012) clearly have the tightest correlation with halo
mass. The PCA masses use the full galaxy spectrum, differentiating them from
other estimates that only use optical photometric information. Using the PCA
masses, we measure the large-scale bias as a function of Mgal for galaxies with
logMgal>=11.4, correcting for incompleteness at the low-mass end of our
measurements. Using the abundance-matching ansatz to connect dark matter halo
mass to stellar mass, we construct theoretical models of b(Mgal) that match the
same stellar mass function but have different amounts of scatter in stellar
mass at fixed halo mass, sigma_logM. Using this approach, we find
sigma_logM=0.18^{+0.01}_{-0.02}. This value includes both intrinsic scatter as
well as random errors in the stellar masses. To partially remove the latter, we
use repeated spectra to estimate statistical errors on the stellar masses,
yielding an upper limit to the intrinsic scatter of 0.16 dex.

molecular-level physico-chemical processes of contaminant rejection are not
well understood. Here we carry out NEMD simulations on a model polyamide RO
membrane to understand the mechanisms of transport and rejection of both ionic
and neutral contaminants in water. We observe that the rejection changes
non-monotonously with ion sizes. In particular, the rejection of urea, 2.4 A
radius, is higher than ethanol, 2.6 A radius, and the rejections for organic
solutes, 2.2-2.8 A radius, are lower than Na+, 1.4 A radius, or Cl-, 2.3 A
radius. We show that this can be explained in terms of the solute accessible
intermolecular volume in the membrane and the solute-water pair interaction
energy. If the smallest open spaces in the membrane's molecular structure are
all larger than the hydrated solute, then the solute-water pair interaction
energy does not matter. However, when the open spaces in the polymeric
structure are such that solutes have to shed at least one water molecule to
pass through a portion of the membrane molecular structure, the pair
interaction energy governs solute rejection. The high pair interaction energy
for water molecules in the solvation shell for ions makes the water molecules
difficult to shed, thus enhancing the rejection of ions. On the other hand, the
organic solute-water interaction energies are governed by the water molecules
that are hydrogen bonded to the solute. Urea molecules have more
hydrogen-bonding sites than alcohol molecules, leading to a higher rejection of
urea than occurs for ethanol, a molecule of similar size but with fewer
hydrogen bonding sites. These findings underline the importance of the solute's
solvation shell and solute-water-membrane chemistry in the context of reverse
osmosis, thus providing new insights into solute transport and rejection in RO
membranes.

concentration--mass relation for massive clusters, finding a power-law mass
dependence with a slope of $\kappa_m=-0.16\pm0.07$, in agreement with CDM
predictions. For this relaxed sample, the relation is consistent with a
constant as a function of redshift (power-law slope with $1+z$ of

radial range probed by the data (typically $\sim50$kpc--1Mpc), and test for
departures from the simple Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) form, for which the
logarithmic slope of the density profile tends to $-1$ at small radii.
Specifically, we consider as alternatives the generalized NFW (GNFW) and
Einasto parametrizations. For the GNFW model, we find an average value of

the atmosphere from Titan's surface to an altitude of 1500 km. We consider the
effects of condensation and sublimation using a continuous, numerically stable
method. This is coupled with parameterized treatments of the sedimentation of
the aerosols and their condensates, and the formation of haze particles. These
processes affect the abundances of heavier species such as the nitrogen-bearing
molecules, but have less effect on the abundances of lighter molecules. Removal
of molecules to form aerosols also plays a role in determining the mixing
ratios, in particular of HNC, HC3N and HCN. We find good agreement with the
recently detected mixing ratios of C2H5CN, with condensation playing an
important role in determining the abundance of this molecule below 500 km. Of
particular interest is the chemistry of acrylonitrile (C2H3CN) which has been
suggested by Stevenson et al. (2015) as a molecule that could form biological
membranes in an oxygen-deficient environment. With the inclusion of haze

find that the spectral bandwidth of the fields is, quite generally, independent

does increase with the number of particles. Nevertheless, we find that the

delays---the sum of the delays around a closed loop of baselines. The closure
delay is independent of the instrumental and propagation delays and provides
valuable additional information about the source structure. We demonstrate the
use of this new ""observable"" for the determination of the structure in the
radio source 0642+449. This source, as one of the defining sources in the
second realization of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF2), is
found to have two point-like components with a relative position offset of -426
microarcseconds in right ascension and -66 microarcseconds in declination. The
two components are almost equally bright with a flux-density ratio of 0.92. The
standard deviation of closure delays for source 0642+449 was reduced from 139
ps to 90 ps by using this two-component model. Closure delays larger than one
nanosecond are found to be related to the source structure, demonstrating that
structure effects for a source with this simple structure could be up to tens
of nanoseconds. The method described in this paper does not rely on a priori

a pair of spiral arms were detected in the $H$-band emission and an asymmetric

emission. We discuss the origin of the spiral arm and the asymmetric structure,
and suggest that a massive unseen planet is the most plausible explanation. The
possibility of dust trapping and grain growth causing the asymmetric structure

SED slope between 0.87 mm from our SMA observation and 1.3 mm from literature.
The results imply that grains are indistinguishable from ISM-like dust in the
east side ($beta = 2.0 pm 0.5$), but much smaller in the west side $beta =
0.7^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$, indicating differential dust size distribution between the
two sides of the disk. Combining the results of near-infrared and submillimeter
observations, we conjecture that the spiral arms exist at the upper surface and
an asymmetric structure resides in the disk interior. Future observations at
centimeter wavelengths and differential polarization imaging in other bands (Y
to K) with extreme AO imagers are required to understand how large dust grains
form and to further explore the dust distribution in the disk.

characteristics in geodetic and astrometric time series. A specific feature of
astrometric and geodetic measurements, as compared with the clock measurements,
is that they are generally associated with uncertainties; thus, an appropriate
weighting should be applied during data analysis. Besides, some physically
connected scalar time series naturally form series of multi-dimensional
vectors. For example, three station coordinates time series $X$, $Y$, and $Z$
can be combined to analyze 3D station position variations. The classical AVAR
is not intended for processing unevenly weighted and/or multi-dimensional data.
Therefore, AVAR modifications, namely weighted AVAR (WAVAR), multi-dimensional
AVAR (MAVAR), and weighted multi-dimensional AVAR (WMAVAR), were introduced to
overcome these deficiencies. In this paper, a brief review is given of the
experience of using AVAR and its modifications in processing astro-geodetic

The patch spaces of core spaces, obtained by joining the original topology with
a second topology having the dual specialization order, are the so-called
sector spaces, which have good convexity and separation properties and
determine the original space. The category of core spaces is shown to be
concretely isomorphic to the category of fan spaces; these are certain
quasi-ordered spaces having neighborhood bases of so-called fans, obtained by
deleting a finite number of principal filters from a principal filter. This
approach has useful consequences for domain theory. In fact, endowed with the
Scott topology, the continuous domains are nothing but the sober core spaces,
and endowed with the Lawson topology, they are the corresponding fan spaces. We
generalize the characterization of continuous lattices as meet-continuous
lattices with T$_2$ Lawson topology and extend the Fundamental Theorem of
Compact Semilattices to non-complete structures. Finally, we investigate
cardinal invariants like density and weight of the involved objects.

goal of this paper is to construct multilevel parallel preconditioners for
solving the resulting Helmholtz systems. To this end, we first build a
multilevel overlapping space decomposition for the plane wave discretization
space based on a multilevel overlapping domain decomposition method. Then,
corresponding to the space decomposition, we construct an additive multilevel
preconditioner for the underlying Helmholtz systems. Further, we design both
additive and multiplicative multilevel preconditioners with smoothers, which
are different from the standard multigrid preconditioners. We apply the
proposed multilevel preconditioners with a {\it constant} coarsest mesh size to
solve two dimensional Helmholtz systems generated by PWLS method or PWDG
method, and we find that the new preconditioners possess nearly stable
convergence, i.e., the iteration counts of the preconditioned iterative methods

$m=3$ cases in the SK model the final energy reached in the quench is very
close to the energy $E_c$ at which the overlap of the states would acquire
replica symmetry breaking features. These minima have marginal stability and
will have long-range correlations between them. In the SK limit we have
analytically studied the density of states $\rho(\lambda)$ of the Hessian
matrix in the annealed approximation. Despite the absence of continuous
symmetries, the spectrum extends down to zero with the usual $\sqrt{\lambda}$
form for the density of states for $h_{r}<h_{AT}$. However, when
$h_{r}>h_{AT}$, there is a gap in the spectrum which closes up as $h_{AT}$ is
approached. For the VB model and the other models our numerical work shows that
there always exist some low-lying eigenvalues and there never seems to be a

that collinear divergences associated with initial and final state parton

In the context of
financial risk management, the clustering of high-severity risks has a
devastating effect on the well-being of firms and is thus of pivotal importance
in risk analysis.When it comes to quantifying the extent of tail dependence, it
is generally agreed that measures of tail dependence must be independent of the
marginal distributions of the risks but rather solely copula-dependent. Indeed,
all classical measures of tail dependence are such, but they investigate the
amount of tail dependence along the main diagonal of copulas, which has often
little in common with the concentration of extremes in the copulas' domain of
definition.In this paper we urge that the classical measures of tail dependence
may underestimate the level of tail dependence in copulas. For the Gaussian
copula, however, we prove that the classical measures are maximal. The
implication of the result is two-fold: On the one hand, it means that in the
Gaussian case, the (weak) measures of tail dependence that have been reported

practitioners. On the other hand, it further encourages substitution of the
Gaussian copula with other copulas that are more tail dependent.

goal. One accepts the heterogeneous nature of the community which comprises
scientists from physics, chemistry, bio-physics, and materials science, by
complying with the diverse ecosystem of computer codes and thus develops
""converters"" for the input and output files of all important codes. These
converters then translate the data of all important codes into a standardized,
code-independent format. The other strategy is to provide standardized open
libraries that code developers can adopt for shaping their inputs, outputs, and
restart files, directly into the same code-independent format. We like to
emphasize in this paper that these two strategies can and should be regarded as
complementary, if not even synergetic. The main concepts and software

opto-acoustic devices. We develop a Hamiltonian formalism for cascaded
Brillouin scattering valid for both quantum and classical regimes. By regarding
Brillouin scattering as the interaction of a single acoustic envelope and a
single optical envelope that covers all Stokes and anti-Stokes orders, we
obtain a compact model that is well suited for numerical implementation,
extension to include other optical nonlinearities or short pulses, and
application in the quantum-optics domain. We then theoretically analyze
intra-mode forward Brillouin scattering (FBS) for arbitrary waveguides with and
without optical dispersion. In the absence of optical dispersion, we find an
exact analytical solution. With a perturbative approach, we furthermore solve
the case of weak optical dispersion. Our work leads to several key results on
intra-mode FBS. For negligible dispersion, we show that cascaded intra-mode FBS
results in a pure phase modulation and discuss how this necessitates specific
experimental methods for the observation of fibre-based and integrated FBS.
Further, we discuss how the descriptions that have been established in these
two classes of waveguides connect to each other and to the broader context of
cavity opto-mechanics and Raman scattering. Finally, we draw an unexpected
striking similarity between FBS and discrete diffraction phenomena in waveguide
arrays, which makes FBS an interesting candidate for future research in
quantum-optics.

is becoming a fundamental and important task, with many potential applications
such as user privacy protection or interest group recommendation. So far, most
studies have focused on addressing two questions, namely, how to detect
overlapping circles and how to detect circles using a combination of network
structure and network node attributes. This paper asks an orthogonal research
question, that is, how to detect circles based on network structures that are
(usually) described by multiple views? Our investigation begins with crawling
ego-networks from Twitter and employing classic techniques to model their
structures by six views, including user relationships, user interactions and
user content. We then apply both standard and our modified multi-view spectral
clustering techniques to detect social circles in these ego-networks. Based on
extensive automatic and manual experimental evaluations, we deliver two major
findings: first, multi-view clustering techniques perform better than common
single-view clustering techniques, which only use one view or naively integrate
all views for detection, second, the standard multi-view clustering technique
is less robust than our modified technique, which selectively transfers
information across views based on an assumption that sparse network structures
are (potentially) incomplete. In particular, the second finding makes us
believe a direct application of standard clustering on potentially incomplete
networks may yield biased results. We lightly examine this issue in theory,
where we derive an upper bound for such bias by integrating theories of
spectral clustering and matrix perturbation, and discuss how it may be affected
by several network characteristics.

of fundamental importance in a wide range of applications, such as the
developing of protocols for mobile ad-hoc networks or what-if analysis in urban
ecosystems. Current generative algorithms fail in accurately reproducing the
individuals' recurrent schedules and at the same time in accounting for the
possibility that individuals may break the routine during periods of variable
duration. In this article we present DITRAS (DIary-based TRAjectory Simulator),
a framework to simulate the spatio-temporal patterns of human mobility. DITRAS
operates in two steps: the generation of a mobility diary and the translation
of the mobility diary into a mobility trajectory. We propose a data-driven
algorithm which constructs a diary generator from real data, capturing the
tendency of individuals to follow or break their routine. We also propose a
trajectory generator based on the concept of preferential exploration and
preferential return. We instantiate DITRAS with the proposed diary and
trajectory generators and compare the resulting algorithm with real data and
synthetic data produced by other generative algorithms, built by instantiating
DITRAS with several combinations of diary and trajectory generators. We show
that the proposed algorithm reproduces the statistical properties of real
trajectories in the most accurate way, making a step forward the understanding
of the origin of the spatio-temporal patterns of human mobility.
