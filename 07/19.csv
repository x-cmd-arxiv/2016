There are a number of different possible generalizations. We consider two of

the concept of quantum dissension. This new measure, called dissension vector,
is a set of numbers -- quantumness vector. This can be thought of as a
fine-grained measure, as opposed to measures that quantify some average quantum
properties of a system. These quantities quantify/characterize the correlations
present in multiparticle states. We consider some multiqubit states and find
that these quantities are responsive to different aspects of quantumness, and
correlations present in a state. We find that different dissension vectors can
track the correlations (both classical and quantum), or quantumness only. As
physical applications, we find that these vectors might be useful in several
information processing tasks. We consider the role of dissension vectors -- (a)
in deciding the security of BB84 protocol against an eavesdropper and (b) in
determining the possible role of correlations in the performance of Grover

a network by programatically managing the forwarding rules installed on

membership changes or faults is a key element to preserve their functionality.
In recent years, various self-stabilizing overlay networks have been proposed
that have the advantage of being able to recover from any illegal state.
However, the vast majority of these networks cannot give any guarantees on its
functionality while the recovery process is going on. We are especially
interested in searchability, i.e., the functionality that search messages for a
specific identifier are answered successfully if a node with that identifier
exists in the network. We investigate overlay networks that are not only
self-stabilizing but that also ensure that monotonic searchability is
maintained while the recovery process is going on, as long as there are no
corrupted messages in the system. More precisely, once a search message from
node $u$ to another node $v$ is successfully delivered, all future search
messages from $u$ to $v$ succeed as well. Monotonic searchability was recently
introduced in OPODIS 2015, in which the authors provide a solution for a simple
line topology.
  We present the first universal approach to maintain monotonic searchability
that is applicable to a wide range of topologies. As the base for our approach,
we introduce a set of primitives for manipulating overlay networks that allows
us to maintain searchability and show how existing protocols can be transformed
to use theses primitives.
  We complement this result with a generic search protocol that together with
the use of our primitives guarantees monotonic searchability.
  As an additional feature, searching existing nodes with the generic search
protocol is as fast as searching a node with any other fixed routing protocol
once the topology has stabilized.

yet ultra-precise wavelength reference. We describe here a turn-key system
working at 500 nm to 900 nm, ready to be installed at any current and next
generation radial velocity spectrograph that requires calibration over a wide
spectral bandpass. Where appropriate, we have used off-the-shelf, commercial
components with demonstrated long-term performance to accelerate the
development timescale of this instrument. Our system combines for the first
time the advantages of passively stabilized etalons for optical and
near-infrared wavelengths with the laser-locking technique demonstrated for
single-mode fiber etalons. We realize uncertainties in the position of one
etalon line at the 10 cm/s level in individual measurements taken at 4 Hz. When
binning the data over 10 s, we are able to trace the etalon line with a
precision of better than 3 cm/s . We present data obtained during a week of
continuous operation where we detect (and correct for) the predicted, but
previously unobserved shrinking of the etalon Zerodur spacer corresponding to a
shift of 13 cm/s per day.

under a traditional model of PP, studies that examine the impact of using an

of using an IDE, we present the results of a controlled experiment that expose
the influence on quality, measured as the number of defects injected per hour,
and cost, measured as the time necessary to complete programming assignments,
of pair and solo programming with and without the use of an IDE. For quality,
our findings suggest that the use of an IDE results in significantly higher
defect injection rates (for both pairs and solos) when the programming
assignment is not very complicated. Nevertheless, defect injection rates seem
to decrease when pairs work on more complicated programming assignments
irrespective of the tool support used. For cost, the programming assignment
significantly affects the time necessary to complete the assignment. Finally,
both aspects (quality and cost) are affected in a similar manner when either
pair or solo programming is used.

  occupancy models",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When evaluating the ecological value of land use within a landscape,
investigators typically rely on measures of habitat selection and habitat
quality. Traditional measures of habitat selection and habitat quality require
data from resource intensive study designs (e.g., telemetry or mark-recapture).
Often, managers must evaluate ecological value despite only having data from
less resource intensive study designs. In this paper, we use occupancy data to
measure habitat quality and habitat selection response for the Puerto Rican
Vireo, an endemic songbird whose population growth is depressed by brood
parasitism from the Shiny Cowbird. We were interested in how vireo habitat
quality and vireo habitat selection varied among three land uses (forest,
shaded coffee plantations, and sun coffee) in Puerto Rico. We estimated vireo
occupancy probability as a measure of habitat selection, and the probability of
cowbird occurrence given vireo presence as a measure of habitat quality. To
estimate the latter, we explored different ways of modeling the occurrence of
the two species jointly, and compared these models to independent models using
measures of predictive performance. Vireos preferentially selected forested
sites and shaded coffee sites over sun coffee sites. By our measure of habitat
quality, either type of coffee plantation was poor quality, and the forested
sites were high quality. This suggests that shade coffee may be an ecological
trap for the vireo in our study area. One joint model performed best by our
measures of predictive ability, thus showing that the cowbird may not occur
independently of the vireo. Vireo population dynamics in our study area may
benefit from having large amounts of forest relative to coffee plantations.
Incorporating species interactions into occupancy models has the potential to
improve monitoring for conservation.

computing tasks, but also often buy extra computing resources from clouds.
Cloud vendors such as Amazon EC2 offer two types of purchase options: on-demand
and spot instances. As tenants have limited budgets to satisfy their computing
needs, it is crucial for them to determine how to purchase different options
and utilize them (in addition to possible self-owned instances) in a
cost-effective manner while respecting their response-time targets. In this
paper, we propose a framework to design policies to allocate self-owned,
on-demand and spot instances to arriving jobs. In particular, we propose a
near-optimal policy to determine the number of self-owned instance and an
optimal policy to determine the number of on-demand instances to buy and the
number of spot instances to bid for at each time unit. Our policies rely on a
small number of parameters and we use an online learning technique to infer
their optimal values. Through numerical simulations, we show the effectiveness
of our proposed policies, in particular that they achieve a cost reduction of
up to 64.51% when spot and on-demand instances are considered and of up to
43.74% when self-owned instances are considered, compared to previously
proposed or intuitive policies.

this technique for measurement of band-projectors in finite, disordered systems

of the Chern number. Our approach demonstrates the extraordinary potential of
microwave quantum circuits for exploration of exotic synthetic materials,

to preserve fine details of the underlying signal, especially discontinuities
such as jumps (in dimension one) or edges (in dimension two). In homogeneous
regions of the domain the procedure smoothes the data by averaging nearby data
points to reduce the noise, whereas in inhomogenous regions the neighboring
points are only taken into account when their value is close to the current
one. This results in a denoised reconstruction or estimate of the true signal
without blurring finer details.
  This paper addresses the lack of results about the construction and
evaluation of confidence intervals based on the vertically weighted average,
which is required for a proper statistical evaluation of its estimation
accuracy. Based on recent results we discuss and investigate in greater detail
fixed sample as well as fixed width (conditional) confidence intervals
constructed from this estimator. The fixed width approach allows to specify
explicitly the estimator's accuracy and determines a random sample size to
ensure the required coverage probability. This also fixes to some extent the
inherent property of the vertically weighted average that its variability is
higher in low-density regions than in high-density regions. To estimate the
variances required to construct the procedures, we rely on resampling
techniques, especially the bootstrap and the jackknife.
  Extensive Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed confidence intervals
are reliable in terms of their coverage probabilities for a wide range of

pronounced effects in the nonlinear response which arise solely from the
crystal anisotropy. Specifically, we demonstrate that the axial and planar
transverse optical phonon resonances selectively and exclusively appear in the
corresponding tensor elements of the nonlinear susceptibility, enabling
observation of an intense SHG peak originating from a weak phonon mode due to
zone-folding along the c-axis of 4H-SiC. Similarly, we identify an anisotropy
factor $\zeta \equiv \epsilon_\perp/\epsilon_\parallel$ responsible for a steep
enhancement of the transmitted fundamental fields at the axial longitudinal
optical phonon frequency, resulting in strongly enhanced SHG. We develop a
general recipe to extract all these features that is directly applicable to all
wurtzite-structure polar dielectrics, where a very similar behavior is
expected. Our model study illustrates the opportunities for utilizing the
crystal anisotropy for selectively enhancing nonlinear-optical effects in polar
dielectrics, which could potentially be extended to built-in anisotropy in

can train a classifier using a labeled image dataset, obtaining a

model is used to map low-level frame vectors into high-level vectors (e.g.,
classifier probability scores). Then, we apply pooling operations to the frame
vectors to create the final bag of attributes for the video. In the BoA
representation, each dimension corresponds to one category (or attribute) of
the semantic space. Other interesting properties are: compactness, flexibility
regarding the classifier, and ability to encode multiple semantic concepts in a
single video representation. Our experiments considered the semantic space
created by state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks pre-trained on 1000

  In particular, given a network graph \mbox{$G=(V,E)$}, in the weak \LOCAL\
model nodes communicate in synchronous rounds and they can use unbounded local
computation. We assume that the nodes have no identifiers, but that instead,
the computation starts with an initial valid vertex coloring. A node can
\textbf{broadcast} a \textbf{single} message of \textbf{unbounded} size to its
neighbors and receives the \textbf{set of messages} sent to it by its
neighbors. That is, if two neighbors of a node $v\in V$ send the same message
to $v$, $v$ will receive this message only a single time; without any further
knowledge, $v$ cannot know whether a received message was sent by only one or
more than one neighbor.
  Neighborhood graphs have been essential in the proof of lower bounds for
distributed coloring algorithms, e.g., \cite{linial92,Kuhn2006On}. Our proof
analyzes the recursive structure of the neighborhood graph of the respective
model to devise an $\Omega\big(\Delta^{\frac{1}{3}-\frac{\eta}{3}}\big)$ lower
bound on the runtime for any deterministic distributed

  Furthermore, we hope that the proof technique improves the understanding of
neighborhood graphs in general and that it will help towards finding a lower

Our proof technique works for one-round algorithms in the standard \LOCAL\
model and provides a simpler and more intuitive proof for an existing
$\Omega(\Delta^2)$ lower bound.

architecture is proposed. The setup consists of three harmonic oscillators
coupled to a Josephson unction. The refrigerator is autonomous in the sense
that it does not require any external control for cooling, but only thermal
contact between the oscillators and heat baths at different temperatures. In
addition, the setup features a built-in switch, which allows the cooling to be
turned on and off. If timing control is available, this enables the possibility
for coherence-enhanced cooling. Finally, we show that significant cooling can
be achieved with experimentally realistic parameters and that our setup should
be within reach of current technology.

states in a system composed by two quantum dots, in which one of then is
coupled to a conventional superconductor, SC1, and the other connects to a
topological superconductor, SC2. By controlling the interdot coupling we can
drive the system from a two single (uncoupled) quantum dots to a double
(coupled) dot system configurations. We employ a recursive Green's function
technique that provides us with numerically exact results for the local density
of states of the system. We first show that in the uncoupled dot configuration
(single dot behavior) the Majorana and the Andreev bound states appear in an
individual dot in two completely distinct regimes. Therefore, they cannot
coexist in the single quantum dot system. We then study the coexistence of
these states in the coupled double-dot configuration. In this situation we show
that in the trivial phase of the SC2, the Andreev states are bound to an
individual quantum dot in the atomic regime (weak interdot coupling) or
extended over the entire molecule in the molecular regime (strong interdot
coupling). More interesting features is actually seen in the topological phase
of the SC2. In this case, in the atomic limit, the Andreev states appear bound
to one of the quantum dots while a Majorana zero mode appears in the other one.
In the molecular regime, on the other hand, the Andreev bound states take over
the entire molecule while the Majorana state remains always bound to one of the
quantum dots.

not sufficient to predict tablet tensile strength. A decrease in the 'work of

first identify a Lagrangian gauge which is suitable for incorporating nonzero

recover the fully nonlinear Newtonian cosmological equations in the Lagrangian

of general relativity. We then linearize our expressions and recover the

Therefore, the introduced approximation scheme provides a unified treatment for

a challenge when the untrusted environment must perform some processing on the

services. Approaches based on Secure Signal Processing (SSP) address this
challenge by proposing novel mechanisms for signal processing in the encrypted
domain and interactive secure protocols to achieve the goal of protecting
signals without disclosing the sensitive information they convey.
  This work presents a novel and comprehensive set of approaches and primitives
to efficiently process signals in an encrypted form, by using Number Theoretic
Transforms (NTTs) in innovative ways. This usage of NTTs paired with
appropriate signal pre- and post-coding enables a whole range of easily
composable signal processing operations comprising, among others, filtering,
generalized convolutions, matrix-based processing or error correcting codes.
The main focus is on unattended processing, in which no interaction from the
client is needed; for implementation purposes, efficient lattice-based somewhat
homomorphic cryptosystems are used. We exemplify these approaches and evaluate
their performance and accuracy, proving that the proposed framework opens up a

The density matrix $\hat \rho$ of these states displays a universal structure.
Suppose that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are different eigenstates of the Hamiltonian

\rho|\beta>$ behaves as a random number which approximately follows the Laplace
distribution with zero mean. In thermodynamic limit, the variance of

obeyed, the initial state evolves into NESS in the long time limit. We present
numerical evidence of our hypothesis in a few chaotic models. Furthermore, we

functionals are closed under a rule-like version Spector's bar recursion of
lowest type levels $0$ and $1$. More precisely, if the functional $Y$ which
controls the stopping condition of Spector's bar recursor is
$\text{T}$-definable, then the corresponding bar recursion of type levels $0$
and $1$ is already $\text{T}$-definable. Schwichtenberg's original proof,
however, relies on a detour through Tait's infinitary terms and the
correspondence between ordinal recursion for $\alpha < \varepsilon_0$ and
primitive recursion over finite types. This detour makes it hard to calculate
on given concrete system $\text{T}$ input, what the corresponding system
$\text{T}$ output would look like. In this paper we present an alternative
(more direct) proof based on an explicit construction which we prove correct
via a suitably defined logical relation. We show through an example how this
gives a straightforward mechanism for converting bar recursive definitions into
$\text{T}$-definitions under the conditions of Schwichtenberg's theorem.
Finally, with the explicit construction we can also easily state a sharper
result: if $Y$ is in the fragment $\text{T}_i$ then terms built from
$\text{BR}^{\mathbb{N}, \sigma}$ for this particular $Y$ are definable in the
fragment $\text{T}_{i + \max \{ 1, \text{level}{\sigma} \} + 2}$.

(e.g. Ising spins) is a notoriously difficult problem, that can be tackled only
under some approximation. Recently a novel variational approach to solve the
stationary dynamical regime has been introduced by Pelizzola [Eur. Phys. J. B,
86 (2013) 120], where simple closed equations are derived under mean-field
approximations based on the cluster variational method. Here we propose to use
the same approximation based on the cluster variational method also for the
non-stationary regime, which has not been considered up to now within this
framework. We check the validity of this approximation in describing the
non-stationary dynamical regime of several Ising models defined on
Erdos-R\'enyi random graphs: we study ferromagnetic models with symmetric and
partially asymmetric couplings, models with random fields and also spin glass
models. A comparison with the actual Glauber dynamics, solved numerically,
shows that one of the two studied approximations (the so-called 'diamond'
approximation) provides very accurate results in all the systems studied. Only
for the spin glass models we find some small discrepancies in the very low
temperature phase, probably due to the existence of a large number of
metastable states. Given the simplicity of the equations to be solved, we
believe the diamond approximation should be considered as the 'minimal
standard' in the description of the non-stationary regime of Ising-like models:
any new method pretending to provide a better approximate description to the
dynamics of Ising-like models should perform at least as good as the diamond
approximation.

section in a spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)
universe is studied. The mathematical problem of solving the full nonlinear
relativistic Boltzmann equation is recast into an infinite set of nonlinear
ordinary differential equations for the moments of the one-particle
distribution function. Momentum-space resolution is determined by the number of
non-hydrodynamic modes included in the moment hierarchy, i.e., by the
truncation order. We show that in the FLRW spacetime the non-hydrodynamic modes
decouple completely from the hydrodynamic degrees of freedom. This results in
the system flowing as an ideal fluid while at the same time producing entropy.
The solutions to the nonlinear Boltzmann equation exhibit transient tails of
the distribution function with nontrivial momentum dependence. The evolution of
this tail is not correctly captured by the relaxation time approximation nor by
the linearized Boltzmann equation. However, the latter probes additional
high-momentum details unresolved by the relaxation time approximation. While
the expansion of the FLRW spacetime is slow enough for the system to move
towards (and not away from) local thermal equilibrium, it is not sufficiently
slow for the system to actually ever reach complete local equilibrium.
Equilibration is fastest in the relaxation time approximation, followed, in
turn, by kinetic evolution with a linearized and a fully nonlinear Boltzmann
collision term.

for the hundredth anniversary of Einstein's prediction of GWs within the theory
of general relativity (GR). The signal represents the first direct detection of
GWs, the first observation of a black-hole binary, and the first test of GR in
its strong-field, high-velocity, nonlinear regime. In the remainder of its
first observing run, LIGO observed two more signals from black-hole binaries,
one moderately loud, another at the boundary of statistical significance. The
detections mark the end of a decades-long quest, and the beginning of GW
astronomy: finally, we are able to probe the unseen, electromagnetically dark
Universe by listening to it. In this article, we present a short historical

crowning achievement of classical physics, with record-setting, ultra-low-noise
laser interferometry, and with some of the most powerful developments in the
theory of differential geometry, partial differential equations,
high-performance computation, numerical analysis, signal processing,
statistical inference, and data science. Our emphasis is on the synergy between
these disciplines, and how mathematics, broadly understood, has historically

may pose some threat to the Earth. Most of the analysis is based on
understanding the capability provided by Sentinel, a concept for an infrared
space-based telescope placed in a heliocentric orbit near the distance of
Venus. From this analysis, we show 1) the size range being targeted can affect
the survey design, 2) the orbit distribution of the target sample can affect
the survey design, 3) minimum observational arc length during the survey is an
important metric of survey performance, and 4) surveys must consider objects as
small as D=15-30 m to meet the goal of identifying objects that have the
potential to cause damage on Earth in the next 100 years. Sentinel will be able
to find 50% of all impactors larger than 40 meters in a 6.5 year survey. The
Sentinel mission concept is shown to be as effective as any survey in finding
objects bigger than D=140 m but is more effective when applied to finding
smaller objects on Earth-impacting orbits. Sentinel is also more effective at
finding objects of interest for human exploration that benefit from lower
propulsion requirements. To explore the interaction between space and ground
search programs, we also study a case where Sentinel is combined with the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope and show the benefit of placing a space-based
observatory in an orbit that reduces the overlap in search regions with a
ground-based telescope. In this case, Sentinel+LSST can find more than 70% of
the impactors larger than 40 meters assuming a 6.5 year lifetime for Sentinel
and 10 years for LSST.

particular branch of machine learning commonly known as deep learning. In the

state-of-the-art results on many datasets. Recent studies in computer aided

two-photon state in spontaneous parametric down-conversion the generated twin
photons are entangled in Hermite-Gaussian (HG) modes. This enables one using HG
modes as an alphabet for quantum communication. For global quantum
communication purposes, we derive an analytic expression for two-photon
detection probability in terms of HG modes taking into account the effects of
the turbulent atmosphere. Our result is more general as it accounts for the
propagation of both, signal and idler photons through the atmosphere, as
opposed to other works considering one of the photons' propagation in vacuum.
We show that while the restrictions on both the parity and order of the
down-converted HG fields no longer hold due to the crosstalk between modes when
propagating in the atmosphere, the crosstalk is not uniform: there are more
robust modes that tend to keep the photons in them. These modes can be employed
in order to increase the fidelity of quantum communication.

proved---using Lagrange multiplier techniques---that under a non-zero input
entropy constraint, a thermal state input minimizes the output entropy of a
pure-loss bosonic channel. In this note, we present our attempt to generalize
this result to all single-mode gauge-covariant Gaussian channels by using
similar techniques. Unlike the case of the pure-loss channel, we cannot prove
that the thermal input state is the only local extremum of the optimization
problem. %It is unclear to us why the same techniques do not lead to a proof
for amplifier channels. However, we do prove that, if the conjecture holds for
gauge-covariant Gaussian channels, it would also hold for gauge-contravariant
Gaussian channels. The truth of the latter leads to a solution of the triple
trade-off and broadcast capacities of quantum-limited amplifier channels. We
note that de Palma et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 160503 (2017)] have now proven
the conjecture for all single-mode gauge-covariant Gaussian channels by
employing a different approach from what we outline here. Proving a multi-mode
generalization of de Palma et al.'s above mentioned result---i.e., given a
lower bound on the von Neumann entropy of the input to an $n$-mode lossy
thermal-noise bosonic channel, an $n$-mode product thermal state input
minimizes the output entropy---will establish an important special case of the
conjectured Entropy Photon-number Inequality (EPnI). The EPnI, if proven true,
would take on a role analogous to Shannon's EPI in proving coding theorem
converses involving quantum limits of classical communication over bosonic

and statistical validation. We distill these candidates into sets of 104
validated planets (57 in multi-planet systems), 30 false positives, and 63
remaining candidates. Our validated systems span a range of properties, with
median values of R_P = 2.3 R_E, P=8.6 d, Tef = 5300 K, and Kp=12.7 mag. Stellar
spectroscopy provides precise stellar and planetary parameters for most of
these systems. We show that K2 has increased by 30% the number of small planets
known to orbit moderately bright stars (1-4 R_E, Kp=9-13 mag). Of particular
interest are 37 planets smaller than 2 R_E, 15 orbiting stars brighter than
Kp=11.5, five receiving Earth-like irradiation levels, and several multi-planet
systems -- including four planets orbiting the M dwarf K2-72 near mean-motion
resonances. By quantifying the likelihood that each candidate is a planet we
demonstrate that our candidate sample has an overall false positive rate of
15-30%, with rates substantially lower for small candidates (< 2 R_E) and
larger for candidates with radii > 8 R_E and/or with P < 3 d. Extrapolation of
the current planetary yield suggests that K2 will discover between 500-1000
planets in its planned four-year mission -- assuming sufficient follow-up
resources are available. Efficient observing and analysis, together with an
organized and coherent follow-up strategy, is essential to maximize the

noise. Here we describe an analytical procedure to forward model the signal of
an exoplanet that accounts for both the observing strategy (angular and
spectral differential imaging) and the data reduction method (Karhunen-Lo\`eve
Image Projection algorithm). We use this forward model to measure the position
of an exoplanet in a Bayesian framework employing Gaussian processes and Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to account for correlated noise. In the case of GPI
data on $\beta$ Pic b, this technique, which we call Bayesian KLIP-FM
Astrometry (BKA), outperforms previous techniques and yields 1$\sigma$-errors
at or below the one milliarcsecond level. We validate BKA by fitting a
Keplerian orbit to twelve GPI observations along with previous astrometry from
other instruments. The statistical properties of the residuals confirm that BKA
is accurate and correctly estimates astrometric errors. Our constraints on the
orbit of $\beta$ Pic b firmly rule out the possibility of a transit of the
planet at 10-$\sigma$ significance. However, we confirm that the Hill sphere of
$\beta$ Pic b will transit, giving us a rare chance to probe the
circumplanetary environment of a young, evolving exoplanet. We provide an

simulations of isolated (non-cosmological) galaxies but also a limited set of
cosmological ""zoom-in"" simulations. Although simulations have shown significant
effects from these physics with weak or absent stellar feedback, the effects
are much weaker than those of stellar feedback when the latter is modeled
explicitly. The additional physics have no systematic effect on galactic star
formation rates (SFRs) . In contrast, removing stellar feedback leads to SFRs
being over-predicted by factors of $\sim 10 -100$. Without feedback, neither
galactic winds nor volume filling hot-phase gas exist, and discs tend to
runaway collapse to ultra-thin scale-heights with unphysically dense clumps
congregating at the galactic center. With stellar feedback, a multi-phase,
turbulent medium with galactic fountains and winds is established. At currently
achievable resolutions and for the investigated halo mass range
$10^{10}-10^{13} M_{\odot}$, the additional physics investigated here (MHD,
conduction, viscosity, metal diffusion) have only weak ($\sim10\%$-level)
effects on regulating SFR and altering the balance of phases, outflows, or the
energy in ISM turbulence, consistent with simple equipartition arguments. We
conclude that galactic star formation and the ISM are primarily governed by a
combination of turbulence, gravitational instabilities, and feedback. We add
the caveat that AGN feedback is not included in the present work.

Berry-phase gauge fields. In metals, quantities such as static polarization and
magnetoelectric $\theta$-term cease to be well-defined. In polar metals there
can be analogous dynamical current responses, which we study in a common
theoretical framework. We find that current responses to dynamical strain in
polar metals depend on both the first and second Chern forms, related to
polarization and magnetoelectricity in insulators, as well as the orbital
magnetization on the Fermi surface. We provide realistic estimates that predict
that the latter contribution will dominate and investigate the feasibility of
experimental detection of this effect.

critical parameter for describing the global physical size of our Galaxy,
important both for interpreting other Galactic measurements and helping us to
understand how our Galaxy fits into extragalactic contexts. Unfortunately,
current estimates span a wide range of values and often are statistically
incompatible with one another. Here, we perform a Bayesian meta-analysis to
determine an improved, aggregate estimate for $L_d$, utilizing a mixture-model
approach to account for the possibility that any one measurement has not
properly accounted for all statistical or systematic errors. Within this
machinery we explore a variety of ways of modeling the nature of problematic
measurements, and then employ a Bayesian model averaging technique to derive
net posterior distributions that incorporate any model-selection uncertainty.
Our meta-analysis combines 29 different (15 visible and 14 infrared)
photometric measurements of $L_d$ available in the literature; these involve a
broad assortment of observational datasets, MW models and assumptions, and
methodologies, all tabulated herein. Analyzing the visible and infrared
measurements separately yields estimates for $L_d$ of $2.71^{+0.22}_{-0.20}$
kpc and $2.51^{+0.15}_{-0.13}$ kpc, respectively, whereas considering them all
combined yields $2.64\pm0.13$ kpc. The ratio between the visible and infrared
scale lengths determined here is very similar to that measured in external
spiral galaxies. We use these results to update the model of the Galactic disk
from our previous work, constraining its stellar mass to be
$4.8^{+1.5}_{-1.1}\times10^{10}$ $\textrm{M}_\odot$, and the MW's total stellar

behaviour, even when their quasi-energy bands have zero Chern numbers. Much
work has been conducted on non-interacting quantum-mechanical models where this
kind of behaviour is present. However, the inclusion of interactions in
out-of-equilibrium quantum systems can prove to be quite challenging. On the
other hand, the classical counterpart of hard-core interactions can be
simulated efficiently via constrained random walks. The non-interacting model
proposed by Rudner et al. [Phys. Rev. X 3, 031005 (2013)], has a special point
for which the system is equivalent to a classical random walk. We consider the
classical counterpart of this model, which is exact at a special point even
when hard-core interactions are present, and show how these quantitatively
affect the edge currents in a strip geometry. We find that the interacting
classical system is well described by a mean-field theory. Using this we
simulate the dynamics of the classical system, which show that the interactions
play the role of Markovian, or time dependent disorder. By comparing the
evolution of classical and quantum edge currents in small lattices, we find
regimes where the classical limit considered gives good insight into the
quantum problem.

solar eruptive events. These phenomena can be generated via several different
physical processes. For space weather, the most important of these is the
temporary void left behind by a coronal mass ejection (CME). Massive, fast CMEs
tend to leave behind a darker void that also usually corresponds to minimum
irradiance for the cooler coronal emissions. If the dimming is associated with
a solar flare, as is often the case, the flare component of the irradiance
light curve in the cooler coronal emission can be isolated and removed using
simultaneous measurements of warmer coronal lines. We apply this technique to
37 dimming events identified during two separate two-week periods in 2011, plus
an event on 2010 August 7 analyzed in a previous paper, to parameterize dimming
in terms of depth and slope. We provide statistics on which combination of
wavelengths worked best for the flare-removal method, describe the fitting
methods applied to the dimming light curves, and compare the dimming parameters
with corresponding CME parameters of mass and speed. The best linear
relationships found are
  $$ \begin{align} v_{CME} \Big[\frac{km}{s} \Big] & \approx 2.36 \times 10^6

Although galaxies well below the MS tend to be undetected in the Arecibo and

obtained through a spectral stacking technique. We find that the position of
galaxies in the SFR-M* plane can be explained mostly by their global cold gas
reservoirs as observed in the HI line, with in addition systematic variations
in the molecular-to-atomic ratio and star formation efficiency. When looking at
galaxies within +/-0.4 dex of the MS, we find that as stellar mass increases,
both atomic and molecular gas mass fractions decrease, stellar bulges become
more prominent, and the mean stellar ages increase. Both star formation
efficiency and molecular-to-atomic ratios vary little for massive main sequence
galaxies, indicating that the flattening of the MS is due to the global
decrease of the cold gas reservoirs of galaxies rather than to bottlenecks in
the process of converting cold atomic gas to stars.

These outflows, powered by angular momentum transport processes and nuclear
recombination, represent an important -- and in some cases dominant --
contribution to the total mass ejected by the merger. Here we calculate the
nucleosynthesis yields from disc outflows using thermodynamic trajectories from
hydrodynamic simulations, coupled to a nuclear reaction network. We find that
outflows produce a robust abundance pattern around the second $r$-process peak
(mass number $A \sim 130$), independent of model parameters, with significant
production of $A < 130$ nuclei. This implies that dynamical ejecta with high
electron fraction may not be required to explain the observed abundances of
$r$-process elements in metal poor stars. Disc outflows reach the third peak ($
A \sim 195$) in most of our simulations, although the amounts produced depend
sensitively on the disc viscosity, initial mass or entropy of the torus, and
nuclear physics inputs. Some of our models produce an abundance spike at $A =
132$ that is absent in the Solar system $r$-process distribution. The spike
arises from convection in the disc and depends on the treatment of nuclear
heating in the simulations. We conclude that disc outflows provide an important

binary mergers, and hence must be included when assessing the contribution of

maximize the transfer fidelities and speeds mainly rely on dynamic control
using time-varying fields and often assume instantaneous readout. We present an
alternative approach to achieving efficient, high-fidelity transfer of
excitations by shaping the energy landscape via the design of time-invariant
feedback control laws without recourse to dynamic control. Both instantaneous
readout and the more realistic case of finite readout windows are considered.
The technique can also be used to freeze information by designing energy
landscapes that achieve Anderson localization. Perfect state or super-optimal
transfer and localization are enabled by conditions on the eigenstructure of
the system and signature properties for the eigenvectors. Given the
eigenstructure enabled by super-optimality, it is shown that feedback
controllers that achieve perfect state transfer are, surprisingly, also the
most robust with regard to uncertainties in the system and control parameters.

spin model which is shown to consistently describe the evolution of low-energy
spin excitations in FeSe, both under applied pressure and upon Se/Te
substitution. The phase diagram, studied using a combination of variational
mean-field, flavor-wave calculations, and density-matrix renormalization group
(DMRG), exhibits a sequence of transitions between the columnar antiferromagnet
common to the iron pnictides, the non-magnetic ferroquadrupolar phase
attributed to FeSe, and the double-stripe antiferromagnetic order known to
exist in Fe$_{1+y}$Te. The calculated spin structure factor in these phases
mimics closely that observed with INS in the Fe(Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$), series. In
addition to the experimentally established phases, the possibility of
incommensurate magnetic order is also predicted.

radiation drag, which can also be determined --in a model dependent way-- from
CMB observations. However, in general, the two quantities need not coincide. We
obtain constraints on the length of the low-redshift standard ruler: $r^h_{\rm

  The low-redshift determination of the standard ruler has an error which is
competitive with the model-dependent determination from cosmic microwave

Baade's Window, roughly 0.2 dex higher than the thin disk and ~0.7 dex higher
than the local thick disk metallicity. This suggests a higher effective yield
in the bulge, perhaps due to more efficient retention of supernova ejecta. The
bulge vertical [Fe/H] gradient, at ~0.5 dex/kpc, appears to be due to a
changing mixture of sub-populations (near +0.3 dex and -0.3 dex and one
possibly near -0.7 dex) with latitude. The bulge is enhanced in O, Mg, Si, Ca,
Ti, and Al relative to the sun, with [alpha/Fe]=+0.15 dex at [Fe/H]=0.0 dex.
Below [Fe/H]~-0.5 dex, the bulge and local thick disk compositions are very
similar, but small [Mg/Fe] and possibly [<SiCaTi>/Fe] enhancements, low [La/Eu]
ratios and large [Cu/Fe], relative to the thick disk suggest slightly higher
SFR in the bulge. However, these composition differences could simply be due to
measurement errors and non-LTE effects. Unfortunately, comparison with the
thick disk near solar [Fe/H] suffers considerable confusion, due to poor
identification of the local thick disk. Unusual zig-zag abundance trends of
[Cu/Fe] and [Na/Fe] suggest nucleosynthesis dominated by core-collapse
supernovae with metallicity-dependent yields, in the Type~Ia supernova
time-delay scenario. Thus, the bulge sub-population compositions resemble the
local thin and thick disks, but at higher [Fe/H], suggesting a radial [Fe/H]
gradient in both the thin and thick disks, within the solar circle, near -0.04
to -0.05 dex/kpc. If the bulge was built through accretion of inner disk stars
by a bar, it appears that the inner thin and thick disk stars, incorporated
into the bulge, retained vertical scale heights characteristic of their
kinematic origin, and resulting in the vertical [Fe/H] gradient and [alpha/Fe]
trends seen today.

frustrated diamond-lattice antiferromagnet, a model in which is predicted to
contain unique incommensurate or `spin-spiral liquid' ground states. Our
previous single-crystal neutron scattering study instead classified it as a
`kinetically-inhibited' antiferromagnet, where the long ranged correlations of
a collinear Neel ground state are blocked by the freezing of domain wall motion
below a first-order phase transition at T* = 6.5 K. The current paper expands
on our original results in several important ways. New elastic and inelastic
neutron measurements are presented that show our initial conclusions are
affected by neither the sample measured nor the instrument resolution, while
measurements to temperatures as low as T = 250 mK limit the possible role being
played by low-lying thermal excitations. Polarized diffuse neutron measurements
confirm reports of short-range antiferromagnetic correlations and diffuse
streaks of scattering, but major diffuse features are explained as signatures
of overlapping critical correlations between neighboring Brillouin zones.
Finally, and critically, this paper presents detailed elastic and inelastic
measurements of magnetic correlations in a single-crystal of MnAl2O4, which
acts as an unfrustrated analogue to CoAl2O4. The unfrustrated material is shown
to have a classical continuous phase transition to Neel order at T_N = 39 K,
with collective spinwave excitations and Lorentzian-like critical correlations
which diverge at the transition. Direct comparison between the two compounds
indicates that CoAl2O4 is unique, not in the nature of high-temperature diffuse
correlations, but rather in the nature of the frozen state below T*. The higher
level of cation inversion in the MnAl2O4 sample indicates that this novel
behavior is primarily an effect of greater next-nearest-neighbor exchange.

completeness higher than $50\%$ at $g\sim24.5$, more than one magnitude fainter
than the oldest turnoff. This is the first time a combination of depth and
coverage of this quality has been used to derive the SFH of Carina, enabling us
to trace its different populations with unprecedented accuracy. We find that
Carina's SFH consists of two episodes well separated by a star formation
temporal gap. These episodes occurred at old ($>10$ Gyr) and intermediate
($2$-$8$ Gyr) ages. Our measurements show that the old episode comprises the
majority of the population, accounting for $54\pm5\%$ of the stellar mass
within $1.3$ times the King tidal radius, while the total stellar mass derived
for Carina is $1.60\pm0.09\times 10^{6} M_{\rm{\odot}}$, and the stellar
mass-to-light ratio $1.8\pm0.2$. The SFH derived is consistent with no recent
star formation which hints that the observed blue plume is due to blue
stragglers. We conclude that the SFH of Carina evolved independently of the
tidal field of the Milky Way, since the frequency and duration of its star
formation events do not correlate with its orbital parameters. This result is
supported by the age/metallicity relation observed in Carina, and the gradients
calculated indicating that outer regions are older and more metal poor.

the magnetic dipole and rotation axes are time dependent. Then we discuss the
detectability of these very pulsars by aLIGO and the Einstein Telescope. We
call attention to the realistic possibility that aLIGO can detect the GWs
generated by at least some of these pulsars, such as Vela, for example.

the XMM-Newton focal plane below an altitude of 70000 km, but above this limit

interaction with a simplified model of the X-ray mirror module and the focal

orbits of observations of the EPIC/pn instrument show that the detection of
flares in regions far outside the radiation belt is largely influenced by the
different orientation of the Earth's magnetosphere respect with XMM-Newton's
orbit, confirming the solar origin of the soft proton population. The Equator-S
proton spectrum at 70000 km altitude is used for the proton population entering
the optics, where a combined multiple and Firsov scattering is used as physics
interaction. If the thick filter is used, the soft protons in the 30-70 keV
energy range are the main contributors to the simulated spectrum below 10 keV.
We are able to reproduce the proton vignetting observed in real data-sets, with
a 50\% decrease from the inner to the outer region, but a maximum flux of 0.01
counts cm-2 s-1 keV-1 is obtained below 10 keV, about 5 times lower than the

between dynamical and stellar mass goes from approximately 0% to 70% of the

the reported continuum limit where the antisymmetric solutions are always
unstable. The instability is either due to the internal modes crossing the
origin or the appearance of a quartet of complex eigenvalues. In general, the
gain-loss term can be considered parasitic as it reduces the stability region
of the onsite solitons. Additionally, we analyse the dynamic behaviour of the
onsite and intersite solitons when unstable, where typically it is either in
the form of travelling solitons or soliton blow-ups.

behavior as the Van der Waals fluid system, provided one treats the
cosmological constant as a thermodynamic variable in an extended phase space.
In this paper, we disclose the deep connection between charged AdS black holes
and Van der Waals fluid system without extending the phase space. We keep the
cosmological constant as a fixed parameter and instead, treat the square of the
charge of black hole as a thermodynamic variable. Therefore, we write the
equation of state as $Q^{2}=Q^{2}(T,\Psi)$ where $\Psi$ (conjugate of $Q^{2} $)
is the inverse of the specific volume, $\Psi=1/v$. This allows us to complete
the analogy of charged AdS black holes with Van der Waals fluid system and
derive the phase transition as well as critical exponents of the system. We
identify a thermodynamic instability in this new picture with real analogy to
Van der Waals fluid with physically relevant Maxwell construction. We therefore
study the critical behavior of isotherms in $% Q^2-\Psi$ diagram and deduce all
the critical exponents of the system and determine that the system exhibits a
small-large black hole phase transition at the critical point $(T_c,Q^2_c,
\Psi_c)$. This alternative view is important as one can imagine such a change
for a given single black hole i. e. acquiring charge which induces the phase
transition. Finally, we disclose the microscopic properties of charged AdS
black holes by using thermodynamic geometry. Interestingly, we find that scalar
curvature has a gap between small and large black holes, and this gap becomes
exceedingly large as one moves away from the critical point along the
transition line. Therefore, we are able to attribute the sudden enlargement of
the black hole to the strong repulsive nature of the internal constituents at
the phase transition.

their limited time to decisions with different properties. We report the
results of two behavioral experiments. In each trial of the experiments, the
participant must accumulate noisy information to make a decision. The
participants received positive and negative rewards for their correct and
incorrect decisions, respectively. The stimulus was designed such that
decisions based on more accumulated information were more accurate but took
longer. Therefore, the total outcome that a participant could achieve during
the limited experiments' time depended on her ""decision threshold"", the amount
of information she needed to make a decision. In the first experiment, two
types of trials were intermixed randomly: hard and easy. Crucially, the hard
trials were associated with smaller positive and negative rewards than the easy
trials. A cue presented at the beginning of each trial would indicate the type
of the upcoming trial. The optimal strategy was to adopt a small decision
threshold for hard trials. The results showed that several of the participants
did not learn this simple strategy. We then investigated how the participants
adjusted their decision threshold based on the feedback they received in each
trial. To this end, we developed and compared 10 computational models for
adjusting the decision threshold. The models differ in their assumptions on the
shape of the decision thresholds and the way the feedback is used to adjust the
decision thresholds. The results of Bayesian model comparison showed that a
model with time-varying thresholds whose parameters are updated by a
reinforcement learning algorithm is the most likely model.

coverage probability worsens. Especially, this effect is more severe as the
transmit power increases. Furthermore, we verify that in an HCN, it is better
to employ at each base station as few transmit antennas as possible.

  Effects",,,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents two novel hyperspectral mixture models and associated
unmixing algorithms. The two models assume a linear mixing model corrupted by
an additive term whose expression can be adapted to account for multiple
scattering nonlinearities (NL), or mismodelling effects (ME). The NL model
generalizes bilinear models by taking into account higher order interaction
terms. The ME model accounts for different effects such as endmember
variability or the presence of outliers. The abundance and residual parameters
of these models are estimated by considering a convex formulation suitable for
fast estimation algorithms. This formulation accounts for constraints such as
the sum-to-one and non-negativity of the abundances, the non-negativity of the
nonlinearity coefficients, the spectral smoothness of the ME terms and the
spatial sparseness of the residuals. The resulting convex problem is solved
using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) whose convergence
is ensured theoretically. The proposed mixture models and their unmixing
algorithms are validated on both synthetic and real images showing competitive
results regarding the quality of the inference and the computational complexity
when compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.

Here, we use a non-equilibrium thermodynamics model, the Shear Transformation
Zone theory, to investigate the dynamics of strain localization and its
connection to stability of sliding in sheared, dry, granular materials. We
consider frictional and frictionless grains as well as presence and absence of
acoustic vibrations. Our results suggest that at low and intermediate strain
rates, persistent shear bands develop only in the absence of vibrations.
Vibrations tend to fluidize the granular network and de-localize slip at these
rates. Stick-slip is only observed for frictional grains and it is confined to
the shear band. At high strain rates, stick-slip disappears and the different
systems exhibit similar stress-slip response. Changing the vibration intensity,
duration or time of application alters the system response and may cause
long-lasting rheological changes. We analyse these observations in terms of
possible transitions between rate strengthening and rate weakening response
facilitated by a competition between shear induced dilation and vibration
induced compaction. We discuss the implications of our results on dynamic
triggering, quiescence and strength evolution in gouge filled fault zones.

  Programming","29 pages, To appear in ESA 2018",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the classic Integer Programming (IP) problem, the objective is to decide

(IP) is an important step in numerous algorithms and it is important to obtain
an understanding of the precise complexity of this problem as a function of
natural parameters of the input.
  The classic pseudo-polynomial time algorithm of Papadimitriou [J. ACM 1981]
for instances of (IP) with a constant number of constraints was only recently
improved upon by Eisenbrand and Weismantel [SODA 2018] and Jansen and Rohwedder
[ArXiv 2018]. We continue this line of work and show that under the Exponential
Time Hypothesis (ETH), the algorithm of Jansen and Rohwedder is nearly optimal.
We also show that when the matrix $A$ is assumed to be non-negative, a
component of Papadimitriou's original algorithm is already nearly optimal under
ETH.
  This motivates us to pick up the line of research initiated by Cunningham and
Geelen [IPCO 2007] who studied the complexity of solving (IP) with non-negative
matrices in which the number of constraints may be unbounded, but the
branch-width of the column-matroid corresponding to the constraint matrix is a
constant. We prove a lower bound on the complexity of solving (IP) for such
instances and obtain optimal results with respect to a closely related
parameter, path-width. Specifically, we prove matching upper and lower bounds
for (IP) when the path-width of the corresponding column-matroid is a constant.

striking difference in the profiles, with H$_2$O emitting at definitely higher

gas-phase chemistry occurring in the postshock gas in the B1 cavity of this
outflow. If the differences in behaviour between ammonia and water are indeed a
consequence of the high gas temperatures reached during the passage of a shock,
then one should find such differences to be ubiquitous among chemically rich
outflows. In order to determine whether the difference in profiles observed
between NH$_3$ and H$_2$O is unique to L1157 or a common characteristic of
chemically rich outflows, we have performed Herschel-HIFI observations of the
NH$_3$(1$_0$-0$_0$) line at 572.5 GHz in a sample of 8 bright low-mass outflow
spots already observed in the H$_2$O(1$_{\rm 10}$--1$_{\rm 01}$) line within
the WISH KP. We detected the ammonia emission at high-velocities at most of the
outflows positions. In all cases, the water emission reaches higher velocities
than NH$_3$, proving that this behaviour is not exclusive of the L1157-B1

this larger sample, that the behaviour of ammonia is determined principally by
the temperature of the gas.

significantly improve the performance of wireless systems. Similar to
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) or MIMO-OFDM, LSA can be also combined with OFDM to deal
with frequency selectivity in wireless channels. However, such combination
suffers from substantially increased complexity proportional to the number of
antennas in LSA systems. For the conventional implementation of LSA-OFDM, the
number of inverse fast Fourier transforms (IFFTs) increases with the antenna
number since each antenna requires an IFFT for OFDM modulation. Furthermore,
zero-forcing (ZF) precoding is required in LSA systems to support more users,
and the required matrix inversion leads to a huge computational burden. In this
paper, we propose a low-complexity recursive convolutional precoding to address
the issues above. The traditional ZF precoding can be implemented through the
recursive convolutional precoding in the time domain so that only one IFFT is
required for each user and the matrix inversion can be also avoided. Simulation
results show that the proposed approach can achieve the same performance as
that of ZF but with much lower complexity.

nature. To prevent mutualism from slipping into antagonism, a host often
invokes a ""carrot and stick"" approach towards symbionts with a stabilizing
effect on their symbiosis. In open human societies, a mutualistic relationship
arises when a native insider population attracts outsiders with benevolent
incentives in hope that the additional labor will improve the standard of all.
A lingering question, however, is the extent to which insiders are willing to
tolerate outsiders before mutualism slips into antagonism. To test the
assertion by Karl Popper that unlimited tolerance leads to the demise of
tolerance, we model a society under a growing incursion from the outside.
Guided by their traditions of maintaining the social fabric and prizing
tolerance, the insiders reduce their benevolence toward the growing
subpopulation of outsiders but do not invoke punishment. This reduction of
benevolence intensifies as less tolerant insiders (e.g., ""radicals"") openly
renounce benevolence. Although more tolerant insiders maintain some level of
benevolence, they may also tacitly support radicals out of fear for the future.
If radicals and their tacit supporters achieve a critical majority, herd
behavior ensues and the relation between the insider and outsider
subpopulations turns antagonistic. To control the risk of unwanted social
dynamics, we map the parameter space within which the tolerance of insiders is
in balance with the assimilation of outsiders, the tolerant insiders maintain a
sustainable majority, and any reduction in benevolence occurs smoothly. We also
identify the circumstances that cause the relations between insiders and
outsiders to collapse or that lead to the dominance of the outsiders.

for instructors who have had negative experiences implementing projects in the
past. Project implementation is given for both lower and upper division
mathematics courses with an emphasis on mathematical modeling and data
collection. Projects provide tangible connections to course content which can
motivate students to learn at a deeper level. Logistical pitfalls and insights
are highlighted as well as descriptions of several key implementation
resources. Effective assessment tools, which allowed me to smoothly adjust to
student feedback, are demonstrated for a sample class. As I smoothed the
transition into each project and guided students through the use of the
technology, their negative feedback on projects decreased and more students
noted how the projects had enhanced their understanding of the course topics.
Best practices learned over the years are given along with project summaries
and sample topics. These projects were implemented at a small liberal arts
university, but advice is given to extend them to larger classes for broader
use.

it affects their dynamics at and out of the equilibrium. We focus in particular
on the Kitaev chains with long-range pairings and on the quantum Ising chain
with long-range antiferromagnetic coupling (both having a power-law decay with
exponent \alpha). By studying the dynamic correlation functions, we find that
for every finite \alpha two different behaviours can be identified, one typical
of short-range systems and the other connected with locality violation. The
latter behaviour is shown related also with the known power-law decay tails
previously observed in the static correlation functions, and originated by
modes, having in general energies far from the minima of the spectrum, where
particular singularities develop as a consequence of the long-rangedness of the
system. We refer to these modes as to ""singular"" modes, and as to ""singular
dynamics"" to their dynamics. For the Kitaev model they are manifest, at finite
\alpha, in derivatives of the quasiparticle energy, the order of the derivative
at which the singularity occurs increasing with \alpha. The features of the
singular modes and their physical consequences are clarified by studying an
effective theory for them and by a critical comparison of the results from this
theory with the lattice ones. Moreover, a numerical study of the effects of the
singular modes on the time evolution after various types of global quenches is
performed. We finally present and discuss the presence of singular modes and
their consequences in interacting long-range systems by investigating in the
long-range Ising quantum chain, both in the deep paramagnetic regime and at
criticality, where they also play a central role for the breakdown of conformal

incommensurate, unidirectional CDW with a well-defined onset at a critical
field strength that is proportional to Hc2. It is related to but distinct from
the short-range bidirectional CDW that exists at zero magnetic field. The
unidirectional CDW possesses a long inplane correlation length as well as
significant correlations between neighboring CuO2 planes, yielding a
correlation volume that is at least 2 - 3 orders of magnitude larger than that
of the zero-field CDW. This is by far the largest CDW correlation volume
observed in any cuprate crystal and so is presumably representative of the
high-field ground-state of an ""ideal"" disorder-free cuprate.

set of affine $\hat u(1)$ current algebras. Its associated canonical charges
generate higher spin soft hair. We focus first on the spin-3 case and then
extend some of our main results to spin-$N$, many of which resemble the spin-2
results: the generators of the asymptotic $W_3$ algebra naturally emerge from
composite operators of the $\hat u(1)$ charges through a twisted Sugawara
construction; our boundary conditions ensure regularity of the Euclidean

call ""higher spin black flowers"", are stationary but not necessarily
spherically symmetric. Finally, we derive the entropy of higher spin black
flowers, and find that for the branch that is continuously connected to the BTZ
black hole, it depends only on the affine purely gravitational zero modes.
Using our map to $W$-algebra currents we recover well-known expressions for
higher spin entropy. We also address higher spin black flowers in the metric

solution to this problem. Indeed, a solution is only available for a few
examples: planes, spheres, or cylinders. Generally, the characterization of
such curves, both in Euclidean ($E^3$) and in Lorentz-Minkowski ($E_1^3$)
spaces, involves an ODE relating curvature and torsion. However, by equipping a
curve with a relatively parallel moving frame, Bishop was able to characterize
spherical curves in $E^3$ through a linear equation relating the coefficients
which dictate the frame motion. Here we apply these ideas to surfaces that are
implicitly defined by a smooth function, $\Sigma=F^{-1}(c)$, by reinterpreting
the problem in the context of the metric given by the Hessian of $F$, which is
not always positive definite. So, we are naturally led to the study of curves
in $E_1^3$. We develop a systematic approach to the construction of Bishop
frames by exploiting the structure of the normal planes induced by the casual
character of the curve, present a complete characterization of spherical curves
in $E_1^3$, and apply it to characterize curves that belong to a non-degenerate
Euclidean quadric. We also interpret the casual character that a curve may
assume when we pass from $E^3$ to $E_1^3$ and finally establish a criterion for
a curve to lie on a level surface of a smooth function, which reduces to a
linear equation when the Hessian is constant.

up an entirely new non-electromagnetic window into the Universe making it
possible to probe physics that has been hidden or dark to electromagnetic
observations. In addition to cataclysmic events involving black holes, GWs can
be triggered by physical processes and systems involving neutron stars.
Properties of neutron stars are largely determined by the equation of state
(EOS) of neutron-rich matter, which is the major ingredient in calculating the
stellar structure and properties of related phenomena, such as gravitational
wave emission from elliptically deformed pulsars and neutron star binaries.
Although the EOS of neutron-rich matter is still rather uncertain mainly due to
the poorly known density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy at high
densities, significant progress has been made recently in constraining the
symmetry energy using data from terrestrial nuclear laboratories. These
constraints could provide useful information on the limits of GWs expected from
neutron stars. Here after briefly reviewing our previous work on constraining
gravitational radiation from elliptically deformed pulsars with terrestrial
nuclear laboratory data in light of the recent gravitational wave detection, we
estimate the maximum gravitational wave strain amplitude, using an optimistic
value for the breaking strain of the neutron star crust, for 15 pulsars at
distances 0.16 kpc to 0.91 kpc from Earth, and find it to be in the range of
$\sim[0.2-31.1]\times 10^{-24}$, depending on the details of the EOS used to
compute the neutron star properties. Implications are discussed.

policing decisions. These tests operate by comparing the success rate of
decisions across groups. For example, if loans made to minority applicants are
observed to be repaid more often than loans made to whites, it suggests that
only exceptionally qualified minorities are granted loans, indicating
discrimination. Outcome tests, however, are known to suffer from the problem of
infra-marginality: even absent discrimination, the repayment rates for minority
and white loan recipients might differ if the two groups have different risk
distributions. Thus, at least in theory, outcome tests can fail to accurately
detect discrimination. We develop a new statistical test of
discrimination---the threshold test---that mitigates the problem of
infra-marginality by jointly estimating decision thresholds and risk
distributions via a hierarchical Bayesian latent variable model. Applying our
test to a dataset of 4.5 million police stops in North Carolina, we find that
the problem of infra-marginality is more than a theoretical possibility, and
can cause the outcome test to yield misleading results in practice.

signal GW150914, which originated from a pair of merging black holes. In the
final 0.2 seconds (about 8 gravitational-wave cycles) before the amplitude
reached its maximum, the observed signal swept up in amplitude and frequency,
from 35 Hz to 150 Hz. The theoretical gravitational-wave signal for merging
black holes, as predicted by general relativity, can be computed only by full
numerical relativity, because analytic approximations fail near the time of
merger. Moreover, the nearly-equal masses, moderate spins, and small number of
orbits of GW150914 are especially straightforward and efficient to simulate
with modern numerical-relativity codes. In this paper, we report the modeling
of GW150914 with numerical-relativity simulations, using black-hole masses and
spins consistent with those inferred from LIGO's measurement. In particular, we
employ two independent numerical-relativity codes that use completely different
analytical and numerical methods to model the same merging black holes and to
compute the emitted gravitational waveform; we find excellent agreement between
the waveforms produced by the two independent codes. These results demonstrate
the validity, impact, and potential of current and future studies using
rapid-response, targeted numerical-relativity simulations for better

antineutrino detectors deployed in two near (560~m and 600~m flux-weighted
baselines) and one far (1640~m flux-weighted baseline) underground experimental
halls. With 621 days of data, more than 1.2 million inverse beta decay (IBD)
candidates were detected. The IBD yield in the eight detectors was measured,
and the ratio of measured to predicted flux was found to be $0.946\pm0.020$
($0.992\pm0.021$) for the Huber+Mueller (ILL+Vogel) model. A 2.9~$\sigma$
deviation was found in the measured IBD positron energy spectrum compared to
the predictions. In particular, an excess of events in the region of 4-6~MeV
was found in the measured spectrum, with a local significance of 4.4~$\sigma$.
A reactor antineutrino spectrum weighted by the IBD cross section is extracted

The Neel order going with spontaneous breaking of $U(1)$ symmetry is safely
allowed at any temperature for three-dimensional systems but allowed only at
zero temperature for purely two-dimensional systems. We closely investigate how
smoothly the ordering process of the three-dimensional system is modulated into
that of the two-dimensional one with reduction of dimensionality, considering
spatially anisotropic quantum antiferromagnets. We first show that the N\'eel
temperature is kept finite even in the two-dimensional limit although the
N\'eel order is greatly suppressed for low-dimensionality. This feature of the
N\'eel temperature is highly nontrivial, which dictates how the order parameter
is squashed under the reduction of dimensionality. Next we investigate this
dimensional modulation of the order parameter. We develop our argument taking
as example a coupled spin-ladder system relevant for experimental studies. The
ordering process is investigated multidirectionally using theoretical
techniques of a mean-field method combined with analytical (exact solutions of
quantum field theories) or numerial (density-matrix renormalization-group)
method, a variational method, a renormalization-group study, linear spin-wave
theory, and quantum Monte-Carlo simulation. We show that these methods

as the traveling time. In addition, with assortative coupling, the
transportation capacity of the system will decrease significantly. However, the
disassortative coupling has little influence on the transportation capacity of

theoretical method is developed to obtain the bandwidth usage of each link,

Compton down-scattering, known as a Compton shoulder (CS), appears at the

potential, its use as a spectral probe of the reflector has been seriously
limited due to observational difficulties and modelling complexities. We
revisit the basic nature of the CS by systematic investigation into its
dependence on spatial and temporal parameters. The calculations are performed
by Monte-Carlo simulations for sphere and slab geometries. The dependence is
obtained in a two-dimensional space of column density and metal abundance,
demonstrating that the CS solves parameter degeneration between them which was
seen in conventional spectral analysis using photoelectric absorption and
fluorescence lines. Unlike the iron line, the CS does not suffer from any
observational dependence on the spectral hardness. The CS profile is highly
dependent on the inclination angle of the slab geometry unless the slab is
Compton-thick, and the time evolution of the CS is shown to be useful to
constrain temporal information on the source if the intrinsic radiation is
variable. We also discuss how atomic binding of the scattering electrons in
cold matter blurs the CS profile, finding that the effect is practically
similar to thermal broadening in a plasma with a moderate temperature of
$\sim$5 eV. Spectral diagnostics using the CS is demonstrated with grating data

  Ingredients of Evolutionary Multitask Optimization","7 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Evolutionary multitasking has recently emerged as a novel paradigm that
enables the similarities and/or latent complementarities (if present) between
distinct optimization tasks to be exploited in an autonomous manner simply by
solving them together with a unified solution representation scheme. An
important matter underpinning future algorithmic advancements is to develop a
better understanding of the driving force behind successful multitask
problem-solving. In this regard, two (seemingly disparate) ideas have been put
forward, namely, (a) implicit genetic transfer as the key ingredient
facilitating the exchange of high-quality genetic material across tasks, and
(b) population diversification resulting in effective global search of the
unified search space encompassing all tasks. In this paper, we present some
empirical results that provide a clearer picture of the relationship between
the two aforementioned propositions. For the numerical experiments we make use
of Sudoku puzzles as case studies, mainly because of their feature that
outwardly unlike puzzle statements can often have nearly identical final
solutions. The experiments reveal that while on many occasions genetic transfer
and population diversity may be viewed as two sides of the same coin, the wider
implication of genetic transfer, as shall be shown herein, captures the true
essence of evolutionary multitasking to the fullest.

can destroy the magnetic order, driving the original antiferromagnetic (AF)

distinct VBS. As $J_k$ is increased, a phase transition from AF to Kondo
paramagnetic (KP) phase occurs, without the intermediate phase coexisting AF
order with Kondo screening found in square lattice systems. In the KP phase,
the enhancement of frustration weakens the Kondo screening effect, resulting in
a phase transition from KP to VBS. We also found a process to recover the AF

indivisible goods, when faced with the online arrival of unit-demand buyers

supply, but can only be produced at a limited rate and are costly to produce.
The seller observes only the bundle of goods purchased at each day, but nothing
else about the buyer's valuation function. Our main result is a dynamic pricing
algorithm for optimizing welfare (including the seller's cost of production)
that runs in time and a number of rounds that are polynomial in $d$ and the
approximation parameter. We are able to do this despite the fact that (i) the
price-response function is not continuous, and even its fractional relaxation
is a non-concave function of the prices, and (ii) the welfare is not observable

welfare over \emph{divisible} goods, which is of independent interest. When
buyers have strongly concave, H\""older continuous valuation functions over $d$
divisible goods, we give a general polynomial time dynamic pricing technique.
We are able to apply this technique to the setting of unit demand buyers

natural fractional relaxation of a unit demand valuation is not strongly
concave. In order to apply our general technique, we introduce a novel price
randomization procedure which has the effect of implicitly inducing buyers to

effects: non-linear phenomena related to the scattering off of the background
curved spacetime (tails) and to the generation of gravitational waves by
gravitational waves (memory). Currently, these hereditary effects are only
known numerically for arbitrary eccentricity through infinite sums of Bessel
functions, with closed-form, analytic results only available in the small
eccentricity limit. We here calculate, for the first time, closed-form,
analytic expressions for all hereditary effects to third post-Newtonian order
in binaries with arbitrary eccentricity. For the tails, we first asymptotically
expand all Bessel functions in high eccentricity and find a superasymptotic
series for each enhancement factor, accurate to better than $10^{-3}$ relative
to post-Newtonian numerical calculations at all eccentricities. We further
improve the small-eccentricity behavior of the superasymptotic series by
generating hyperasymptotic expressions for each enhancement factor, typically
accurate to better than $10^{-8}$ at all eccentricities. For the memory, we
discuss its computation within the context of an osculating approximation of
the binary's orbit and the difficulties that arise. Our closed-form analytic
expressions for the hereditary fluxes allow us to numerically compute orbital

finding such repairs that achieve the best asymptotic complexity. However, the
different semantics that have been proposed for these integrity constraints all
exhibit some counter-intuitive examples. In this work, we look at active
integrity constraints using ideas from algebraic fixpoint theory. We show how
database repairs can be modeled as fixpoints of particular operators on

corresponding notion of grounded database repair that captures several natural
intuitions, and in particular avoids the problems of previous alternative
semantics. In order to study grounded repairs in their full generality, we need
to generalize the notion of grounded fixpoint to non-deterministic operators.

limit raised a hundred years ago has been continuously broken through. In
previous experiments within fluorescence sources, one of the techniques used is
detecting auto-correlation functions. The image is reconstructed by
single-photon and multi-photon detecting intensities. By taking the joint
intensity of more than one single-photon detectors into consideration, the
point spread function of each photon emitter can be resolved even when the
distance of their central position is below the classical diffraction limit.
However, the measurement precision is not considered. In actual detecting
process the detectors are imperfect, they have quantum detecting efficiency
$\eta$ and even can not count the photon numbers during one absorbing process.
Therefore, we analyze the detecting intensity of each detector separately and
use the total Fisher information to depict the resolution. Higher Fisher
information is obtained when second order correlation function is considered
and higher detecting efficiency is beneficial to the Fisher information
enhancement, meanwhile the Cram\`er-Rao bound for an effective distance
resolving is lower than the classical diffraction limits. Furthermore, when the
emitted photons are coherent states, the resolution ability can be enhanced
with infinite single-photon detectors.

significant filters; (II)~re-activate the frozen connections and train the
entire network to improve its overall discriminative capability. We verify the

mmWave frequencies however suffer from very high isotropic pathloss, which may

High directionality techniques will be used to improve signal quality and
extend coverage area, along with a high density deployment of mmWave base
stations (BS). However, when propagation conditions are hard and it is
difficult to provide high quality coverage with mmWave BS, it is necessary to
rely on previous generation LTE base stations, which make use of lower

blurred data, CNN is encouraged to learn blur-insensitive features
automatically. Second, to enhance robustness of CNN features to pose variations

extracts complementary information from holistic face images and patches

features efficiently by sharing the low- and middle-level convolutional layers
between the trunk and branch networks. Third, to further promote the
discriminative power of the representations learnt by TBE-CNN, we propose an
improved triplet loss function. Systematic experiments justify the
effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most impressively, TBE-CNN achieves

at some input locations given a limited number of observations of this

is often considered to tackle such a problem but the method suffers from its
computational burden when the number of observation points is large. We
introduce in this article nested Kriging predictors which are constructed by
aggregating sub-models based on subsets of observation points. This approach is
proven to have better theoretical properties than other aggregation methods
that can be found in the literature. Contrarily to some other methods it can be
shown that the proposed aggregation method is consistent. Finally, the
practical interest of the proposed method is illustrated on simulated datasets
and on an industrial test case with $10^4$ observations in a 6-dimensional

quarks and leptons into a ${\bf 16}$-representational field in each

introduce ${\bf 10}$-representational matter fields, and then the two kinds of
matter fields mix with each other at the SUSY breaking scale, where the extra

that the Standard Model quarks and leptons are given by the linear combinations
of the fields with two different U(1)$^\prime$ charges. The mixing also depends
on the flavor. Consequently, the U(1)$^\prime$ interaction becomes flavor
violating, and the flavor physics is the smoking-gun signal of our GUT model.
The flavor violating $Z'$ couplings are related to the fermion masses and the
CKM matrix, so that we can derive some explicit predictions in flavor physics.

to be discriminative for visual patterns of different complexities. However,
most existing works ignore such cross-layer heterogeneities when classifying
samples of different complexities. For example, if a training sample has
already been correctly classified at a specific layer with high confidence, we
argue that it is unnecessary to enforce rest layers to classify this sample
correctly and a better strategy is to encourage those layers to focus on other
samples.
  In this paper, we propose a layer-wise discriminative learning method to
enhance the discriminative capability of a deep network by allowing its layers
to work collaboratively for classification. Towards this target, we introduce
multiple classifiers on top of multiple layers. Each classifier not only tries
to correctly classify the features from its input layer, but also coordinates
with other classifiers to jointly maximize the final classification
performance. Guided by the other companion classifiers, each classifier learns
to concentrate on certain training examples and boosts the overall performance.
Allowing for end-to-end training, our method can be conveniently embedded into
state-of-the-art deep networks. Experiments with multiple popular deep
networks, including Network in Network, GoogLeNet and VGGNet, on scale-various
object classification benchmarks, including CIFAR100, MNIST and ImageNet, and
scene classification benchmarks, including MIT67, SUN397 and Places205,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In addition, we also analyze the
relationship between the proposed method and classical conditional random

received a great deal of interest due to substantial potential energy savings.
These gains are mainly obtained in two ways: (i) Exploiting the load shifting
capabilities of the cooperative buildings; (ii) Utilizing the expensive but
energy efficient equipment that is commonly shared by the building community
(e.g., heat pumps, batteries and photovoltaics). Several deterministic and
stochastic control schemes that strive to realize these savings, have been
proposed in the literature. A common difficulty with all these methods is
integrating knowledge about the disturbances affecting the system. In this
context, the underlying disturbance distributions are often poorly
characterized based on historical data. In this paper, we address this issue by
exploiting the historical data to construct families of distributions which
contain these underlying distributions with high confidence. We then employ
tools from data-driven robust optimization to formulate a multistage stochastic
optimization problem which can be approximated by a finite-dimensional linear
program. The proposed method is suitable for tackling large scale systems since
its complexity grows polynomially with respect to the system variables. We
demonstrate its efficacy in a numerical study, in which it is shown to
outperform, in terms of energy cost savings and constraint violations,
established solution techniques from the literature. We conclude this study by
showing the significant energy gains that are obtained by cooperatively
managing a collection of buildings with heterogeneous characteristics.

continuous piecewise feedback control strategy is presented, and three methods
are furthermore given to design the controller parameters based on the
developed theorems. By those design methods, the controller parameters in each

dense mid-plane of these disks, planetesimals and planets are expected to form.
The first step in planet formation is the growth of dust particles from
submicrometer-sized grains to macroscopic mm-sized aggregates. The grain growth
is accompanied by radial drift and vertical segregation of the particles within
the disk. To understand this essential evolutionary step, spatially resolved
multi-wavelength observations as well as photometric data are necessary which
reflect the properties of both disk and dust. We present the first spatially
resolved image obtained with NACO at the VLT in the L$_\text{p}$ band of the
near edge-on protoplanetary disk FS Tau B. Based on this new image, a
previously published Hubble image in H band and the spectral energy
distribution from optical to millimeter wavelengths, we derive constraints on
the spatial dust distribution and the progress of grain growth. For this
purpose we perform a disk modeling using the radiative transfer code MC3D.
Radial drift and vertical sedimentation of the dust are not considered. We find
a best-fit model which features a disk extending from $2\,\text{AU}$ to several
hundreds AU with a moderately decreasing surface density and
$M_\text{disk}=2.8\,\times\,10^{-2}\,\text{M}_\odot$. The inclination amounts
to $i=80^\circ$. Our findings indicate that substantial dust grain growth has
taken place and that grains of a size equal to or larger than $1\,\text{mm}$
are present in the disk. In conclusion, the parameters describing the vertical
density distribution are better constrained than those describing the radial
disk structure.

significantly below what is required for storing $S$. In the distance sensitive
setting we work with a set $S$ of (Hamming) vectors and seek a data structure
that offers a similar trade-off, but answers queries of the form ""Is $x$ close
to an element of $S$?"" (in Hamming distance). Previous work on distance
sensitive Bloom filters have accepted false positive and false negative
answers. Absence of false negatives is of critical importance in many
applications of Bloom filters, so it is natural to ask if this can be also
achieved in the distance sensitive setting. Our main contributions are upper
and lower bounds (that are tight in several cases) for space usage in the
distance sensitive setting where false negatives are not allowed.

used as a substitute. However, even when the treatment has a positive average
causal effect (ACE) on the surrogate endpoint, which also has a positive ACE on
the primary outcome, it is still possible that the treatment has a negative ACE

greatly challenges the use of surrogate. In this paper, we provide novel
criteria to exclude the surrogate paradox. Unlike other conditions previously
proposed, our conditions are testable since they only involve observed data.
Furthermore, our criteria are optimal in the sense that they are sufficient and
""almost necessary"" to exclude the paradox: if the conditions are satisfied, the
surrogate paradox is guaranteed to be absent while if the conditions fail,
there exists a data generating process with surrogate paradox that can generate
the same observed data. That is, our criteria capture all the information in
the observed data to exclude the surrogate paradox rather than relying on
unverifiable distributional assumptions.

matrices as elements of a Riemannian manifold and using the concept of geodesic
convexity provide useful tools for studying M-estimators of multivariate
scatter. In this paper, we begin with a mathematically rigorous self-contained
overview of Riemannian geometry on the space of symmetric positive definite
matrices and of the notion of geodesic convexity. The overview contains both a
review as well as new results. In particular, we introduce and utilize first
and second order Taylor expansions with respect to geodesic parametrizations.
This enables us to give sufficient conditions for a function to be geodesically
convex. In addition, we introduce the concept of geodesic coercivity, which is
important in establishing the existence of a minimum to a geodesic convex
function. We also develop a general partial Newton algorithm for minimizing
smooth and strictly geodesically convex functions. We then use these results to
generate a fairly complete picture of the existence, uniqueness and computation
of regularized M-estimators of scatter defined using additive geodescially
convex penalty terms. Various such penalties are demonstrated which shrink an
estimator towards the identity matrix or multiples of the identity matrix.
Finally, we propose a cross-validation method for choosing the scaling
parameter for the penalty function, and illustrate our results using a
numerical example.

1.2E16 ions per cm2 (7.5 dpa) with He+ of 0.25 and 2.0 MeV. The distribution of
Cr atoms within the first two coordination shells around the probe Fe atoms was
expressed in terms of the Warren-Cowley short-range order parameters alpha1
(first-neighbour shell, 1NN), alpha2 (second-neighbour shell, 2NN) and alpha12
(1NN+2NN. In non-irradiated alloys alpha1 was positive and alpha2 was negative
for all three samples which indicates an ordering of Cr atoms. Yet, the value
of alpha12 were close to zero, i.e. the distribution of Cr atoms averaged over
the first two coordination shells around the probe Fe atoms, was random. The
effect of the irradiation of the Fe5Cr sample is similar for the two energies
of the He+ projectiles viz. increase of number of Cr atoms in the 1NN and
decrease in the 2NN shell. Consequently, the degree of the ordering increased.
For the other two samples, the effect of the irradiation depends on the
composition, and it is stronger for the less energetic ions where, in the case
of Fe10Cr, the disordering disappeared and some traces of Cr clustering
(alpha12 weakly positive) can be seen. In the Fe15Cr sample the clustering is
clear. In the samples irradiated with 2.0 MeV ions the ordering also survived
in the samples with x=10.75 and 15.15, although its degree became smaller than

probability as the performance metric for wireless communications over

limitations from a practical point of view: a) it does not give any insight
into the eavesdropper's decodability of confidential messages; b) it cannot
characterize the amount of information leakage to the eavesdropper when an
outage occurs. Motivated by the limitations of the secrecy outage probability,
we propose three new secrecy metrics for secure transmissions over quasi-static
fading channels. The first metric establishes a link between the concept of
secrecy outage and the decodability of messages at the eavesdropper. The second
metric provides an error-probability-based secrecy metric which is typically
used for the practical implementation of secure wireless systems. The third
metric characterizes how much or how fast the confidential information is
leaked to the eavesdropper. We show that the proposed secrecy metrics
collectively give a more comprehensive understanding of physical layer security
over fading channels and enable one to appropriately design secure
communication systems with different views on how secrecy is measured.

Interstellar Molecular Clouds have underlined the importance of realistically
modeling the processes governing their abundance. To this aim, our earlier
calculations for the radiative electron attachment (REA) rates for C4H-, C6H-,
and C8H- are employed to generate the corresponding column density ratios of
anion/neutral (A/N) relative abundances. The latter are then compared with
those obtained from observational measurements. The calculations involved the
time-dependent solutions of a large network of chemical processes over an
extended time interval and included a series of runs in which the values of REA
rates were repeatedly scaled. Macroscopic parameters for the clouds' modeling
were also varied to cover a broad range of physical environments. It was found
that, within the range and quality of the processes included in the present
network,and selected from state-of-the-art astrophysical databases, the REA
values required to match the observed A/N ratios needed to be reduced by orders
of magnitude for C4H- case, while the same rates for C6H- and C8H- only needed
to be scaled by much smaller factors. The results suggest that the generally
proposed formation of interstellar anions by REA mechanism is overestimated by
current models for the C4H- case, for which is likely to be an inefficient path
to formation. This path is thus providing a rather marginal contribution to the
observed abundances of C4H-, the latter being more likely to originate from
other chemical processes in the network, as we discuss in some detail in the
present work.Possible physical reasons for the much smaller differences against
observations found instead for the values of the (A/N) ratios in two other,
longer members of the series are put forward and analyzed within the
evolutionary modeling discussed in the present work.

time-dependent density functional theory to thermoelectric phenomena. As the
field is very young, we emphasize open problems and fundamental issues. We
begin by introducing the formal structure of \emph{thermal density functional
theory}, a density functional theory with two basic variables -- the density
and the energy density -- and two conjugate fields -- the ordinary scalar
potential and Luttinger's thermomechanical potential. The static version of
this theory is contrasted with the familiar finite-temperature density
functional theory, in which only the density is a variable. We then proceed to
constructing the full time-dependent non equilibrium theory, including the
practically important Kohn-Sham equations that go with it. The theory is shown
to recover standard results of the Landauer theory for thermal transport in the
steady state, while showing greater flexibility by allowing a description of
fast thermal response, temperature oscillations and related phenomena. Several
results are presented here for the first time, i.e., the proof of invertibility
of the thermal response function in the linear regime, the full expression of
the thermal currents in the presence of Luttinger's thermomechanical potential,
an explicit prescription for the evaluation of the Kohn-Sham potentials in the
adiabatic local density approximation, a detailed discussion of the leading
dissipative corrections to the adiabatic local density approximation and the
thermal corrections to the resistivity that follow from it.

galaxies. We find that SFRs for nearly edge-on disks are underestimated by
factors ranging from $\sim$ 0.2 dex for low mass galaxies up to $\sim$ 0.4 dex
for high mass galaxies. This results in a substantially flatter MS relation for
high-inclination disks compared to that for less inclined ones, though the
global effect over the whole sample of star-forming galaxies is relatively
minor, given the small fraction of high-inclination disks. However, we also
find that galaxies with high-inclination disks represent a non negligible
fraction of galaxies populating the so-called green valley, with derived SFRs
intermediate between the MS and those of quenched, passively evolving galaxies.

measurement of the relativistic tidal matrix, which is theoretically obtained
from the projection of the Riemann curvature tensor onto the orthonormal tetrad
frame of an observer. The observer's 4-velocity vector defines its local
temporal axis and its local spatial frame is defined by a set of three
orthonormal nonrotating gyro directions. The general tidal matrix for the
timelike geodesics of Kerr spacetime has been calculated by Marck\cite{Marck}.
We are interested in the measured components of the curvature tensor along the
inclined ""circular"" geodesic orbit of a test mass about a slowly rotating
astronomical object of mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$. Therefore, we
specialize Marck's results to such a ""circular"" orbit that is tilted with
respect to the equatorial plane of the Kerr source. To linear order in $J$, we
recover the Mashhoon--Theiss effect, which is due to a small denominator
(""resonance"") phenomenon involving the frequency of geodetic precession. The
Mashhoon--Theiss effect shows up as a special long-period gravitomagnetic part
of the relativistic tidal matrix. The physical interpretation of this effect is
briefly discussed.

optimizing the canonical positions of the facial landmarks. This supervised
learning of the transformations automatically selects the best scale to
differentiate face/non-face patterns. By combining feature maps from both

of their dark-matter halos at both $z=0$ and higher redshifts. . Our main
motivation is the widely accepted idea that the accretion-driven growth of
supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in protogalaxies is limited by quasar-mode
feedback and gas blow-out. The SMBH masses, $M_{\rm{BH}}$, should then be
connected to the dark-matter potential wells at the redshift $z_{\rm{qso}}$ of
the blow-out. We specifically consider the example of a power-law dependence on
the maximum circular speed in a protogalactic dark-matter halo:
$M_{\rm{BH}}\propto V^4_{\rm{d,pk}}$, as could be expected if quasar-mode
feedback were momentum-driven. For halos with a given $V_{\rm{d,pk}}$ at a
given $z_{\rm{qso}}\ge 0$, our model scaling relations give a typical stellar
velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm{ap}}(R_e)$ at $z=0$. Thus, they transform a
theoretical $M_{\rm{BH}}$-$V_{\rm{d,pk}}$ relation into a prediction for an
observable $M_{\rm{BH}}$-$\sigma_{\rm{ap}}(R_e)$ relation. We find the latter
to be distinctly non-linear in log-log space. Its shape depends on the generic
redshift-evolution of halos in a {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology and the systematic
variation of stellar-to-dark matter mass fraction at $z=0$, in addition to any
assumptions about the physics underlying the $M_{\rm{BH}}$-$V_{\rm{d,pk}}$
relation. Despite some clear limitations of the form we use for $M_{\rm{BH}}$
versus $V_{\rm{d,pk}}$, and even though we do not include any SMBH growth
through dry mergers at low redshift, our results for
$M_{\rm{BH}}$-$\sigma_{\rm{ap}}(R_e)$ compare well to data for local early

Two of the most important feedback processes are UV photoionisation and
supernovae from massive stars. However, the precise response of the cloud to
these processes, and the interaction between them, remains an open question. In
particular, we wish to know under which conditions the cloud can be dispersed
by feedback, which in turn can give us hints as to how feedback regulates the
star formation inside the cloud. We perform a suite of radiative
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a 10^5 solar mass cloud with embedded
sources of ionising radiation and supernovae, including multiple supernovae and
a hypernova model. A UV source corresponding to 10% of the mass of the cloud is
required to disperse the cloud, suggesting that the star formation efficiency
should be on the order of 10%. A single supernova is unable to significantly
affect the evolution of the cloud. However, energetic hypernovae and multiple
supernovae are able to add significant quantities of momentum to the cloud,
approximately 10^{43} g cm/s of momentum per 10^{51} ergs of supernova energy.
This is on the lower range of estimates in other works, since dense gas clumps
that remain embedded inside the HII region cause rapid cooling in the supernova
blast. We argue that supernovae alone are unable to regulate star formation in
molecular clouds, and that strong pre-supernova feedback is required to allow
supernova blastwaves to propagate efficiently into the interstellar medium

systems often aims at reproducing static properties alone. The reduced
molecular friction of the CG representation usually results in faster, albeit
inconsistent, dynamics. In this work, we rely on Markov state models to
simultaneously characterize the static and kinetic properties of two CG peptide
force fields---one top-down and one bottom-up. Instead of a rigorous evolution
of CG dynamics (e.g., using a generalized Langevin equation), we attempt to
improve the description of kinetics by simply altering the existing CG models,
which employ standard Langevin dynamics. By varying masses and relevant
force-field parameters, we can improve the timescale separation of the slow
kinetic processes, achieve a more consistent ratio of mean-first-passage times
between metastable states, and refine the relative free-energies between these
states. Importantly, we show that the incorporation of kinetic information into
a structure-based parametrization improves the description of the helix-coil
transition sampled by a minimal CG model. While structure-based models
understabilize the helical state, kinetic constraints help identify CG models
that improve the ratio of forward/backward timescales by effectively hindering
the sampling of spurious conformational intermediate states.

the corresponding velocity of the colloid \textit{if} it is free to move. We

potential of large and future extremely large ground-based telescopes,
especially in the context of the detection and characterization of exoplanets.
Among existing solutions, the vortex coronagraph stands as one of the most
effective and promising solutions. However, for focal-plane coronagraph, a
small inner working angle comes necessarily at the cost of a high sensitivity
to pointing errors. This is the reason why a pointing control system is
imperative to stabilize the star on the vortex center against pointing drifts
due to mechanical flexures, that generally occur during observation due for
instance to temperature and/or gravity variations. We have therefore developed
a technique called QACITS (Quadrant Analysis of Coronagraphic Images for
Tip-tilt Sensing), which is based on the analysis of the coronagraphic image
shape to infer the amount of pointing error. It has been shown that the flux
gradient in the image is directly related to the amount of tip-tilt affecting
the beam. The main advantage of this technique is that it does not require any
additional setup and can thus be easily implemented on all current facilities
equipped with a vortex phase mask. In this paper, we focus on the
implementation of the QACITS sensor at Keck/NIRC2, where an L-band AGPM has
been recently commissioned (June and October 2015), successfully validating the
QACITS estimator in the case of a centrally obstructed pupil. The algorithm has
been designed to be easily handled by any user observing in vortex mode, which
is available for science in shared risk mode since 2016B.

field, but upon further increasing T, the field-dependence becomes shallower.
Eventually, at the highest T considered, the slope changes sign and the
mobility then decreases with the field. This phenomenon can be interpreted with
our model as a result of the competition between intrachain conductive-like
transport (which slows on increasing F) and interchain activated transport
(which is faster at higher F). The former is controlling at high T where
interchain hops are strictly limited to nearest-neighbor monomers on adjacent
chains. At low T, instead, interchain hops to distant sites are allowed and
control the positive correlation of the mobility with the field.

We adopt a scenario approach by randomly sampling the uncertainty set. To
facilitate the computational task, instead of using a single centralized
processor to obtain a ""global solution"" of the scenario problem (SP), we resort
to {\it multiple interconnected processors} that are distributed among
different nodes of a network to simultaneously solve the SP. Then, we propose a
primal-dual sub-gradient algorithm and a random projection algorithm to
distributedly solve the SP over undirected and directed graphs, respectively.
Both algorithms are given in an explicit recursive form with simple iterations,
which are especially suited for processors with limited computational
capability. We show that, if the underlying graph is strongly connected, each
node asymptotically computes a common optimal solution to the SP with a
convergence rate $O(1/(\sum_{t=1}^k\zeta^t))$ where $\{\zeta^t\}$ is a sequence
of appropriately decreasing stepsizes. That is, the RCO is effectively solved
in a distributed way. The relations with the existing literature on robust
convex programs are thoroughly discussed and an example of robust system
identification is included to validate the effectiveness of our distributed
algorithms.

stock market data. We discuss recurrence analysis of time series, decomposition
of aggregate correlation matrices to study co-movements in financial data,
stock level partial correlations with market indices, multidimensional scaling
and minimum spanning tree. We apply these techniques to daily return time
series from the Indian stock market. The analysis allows us to construct
networks based on correlation matrices of individual stocks in one hand and on
the other, we discuss dynamics of market indices. Thus both micro level and
macro level dynamics can be analyzed using such tools. We use the
multi-dimensional scaling methods to visualize the sectoral structure of the
stock market, and analyze the comovements among the sectoral stocks. Finally,
we construct a mesoscopic network based on sectoral indices. Minimum spanning
tree technique is seen to be extremely useful in order to separate
technologically related sectors and the mapping corresponds to actual
production relationship to a reasonable extent.

corresponds to the problem of finding a simple cycle passing through a set of
given terminal edges in a graph. The algorithmic study of the problem on
regular matroids, a superclass of graphic matroids, was initiated by
Gaven\v{c}iak, Kr\'al', and Oum [ICALP'12], who proved that the case of the
problem with |T|=2 is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by the
length of the circuit. We extend the result of Gaven\v{c}iak, Kr\'al', and Oum
by showing that for regular matroids
  - the Minimum Spanning Circuit problem, deciding whether there is a circuit
with at most \ell elements containing T, is FPT parameterized by k=\ell-|T|;
  - the Spanning Circuit problem, deciding whether there is a circuit
containing T, is FPT parameterized by |T|. We note that extending our
algorithmic findings to binary matroids, a superclass of regular matroids, is
highly unlikely: Minimum Spanning Circuit parameterized by \ell is W[1]-hard on
binary matroids even when |T|=1. We also show a limit to how far our results
can be strengthened by considering a smaller parameter. More precisely, we
prove that Minimum Spanning Circuit parameterized by |T| is W[1]-hard even on
cographic matroids, a proper subclass of regular matroids.

vertex correction is ignored in this approach because an inequality $k_F l \gg
1$, where $k_F$ is the Fermi momentum and $l$ mean free path, is satisfied in
ordinary metals with a large Fermi surface. In a Dirac semimetal that has
discrete Fermi points, this inequality may break down even for arbitrarily weak
disorder since $k_F \rightarrow 0$, and thus the vertex correction could be
important. We incorporate the vertex correction into the self-consistent
equations of the superconducting gap and the disorder scattering rate, and then
apply the generalized approach to study how $s$-wave superconductivity is
affected by random chemical potential in two- and three-dimensional Dirac
semimetals, as well as two-dimensional semi-Dirac semimetal. In the clean
limit, superconductivity is formed only when the pairing interaction strength
is greater than some critical value in these materials. Adding random chemical
potential to the system promotes superconductivity by generating a finite
fermionic density of states at the Fermi level. In three-dimensional Dirac
semimetal, the critical attraction strength is reduced by weak disorder, but
remains finite. In the other two cases, superconductivity is induced by
arbitrarily weak attraction. Including the vertex correction does not change
these qualitative results, and actually could further promote superconductivity
in the weak-attraction regime. Bilayer graphene is quite special in that its
zero-energy density of states is nonzero despite the existence of Fermi points.
Due to this peculiar property, superconductivity is always slightly suppressed
by random chemical potential, and the impact of vertex correction is nearly
negligible.

Changes in neuronal activity alter morphological characteristics of dendritic
spines. First step towards understanding the structure-function relationship is
to group spines into main spine classes reported in the literature. Shape
analysis of dendritic spines can help neuroscientists understand the underlying
relationships. Due to unavailability of reliable automated tools, this analysis
is currently performed manually which is a time-intensive and subjective task.
Several studies on spine shape classification have been reported in the
literature, however, there is an on-going debate on whether distinct spine
shape classes exist or whether spines should be modeled through a continuum of
shape variations. Another challenge is the subjectivity and bias that is
introduced due to the supervised nature of classification approaches. In this
paper, we aim to address these issues by presenting a clustering perspective.
In this context, clustering may serve both confirmation of known patterns and
discovery of new ones. We perform cluster analysis on two-photon microscopic
images of spines using morphological, shape, and appearance based features and
gain insights into the spine shape analysis problem. We use histogram of
oriented gradients (HOG), disjunctive normal shape models (DNSM), morphological
features, and intensity profile based features for cluster analysis. We use
x-means to perform cluster analysis that selects the number of clusters
automatically using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). For all features,
this analysis produces 4 clusters and we observe the formation of at least one
cluster consisting of spines which are difficult to be assigned to a known
class. This observation supports the argument of intermediate shape types.

when the new physics invoked to explain the excess corresponds to the
production and decay of a single, relatively narrow, $s$-channel resonance. A
simplifed model of the resonance allows us to convert an estimated signal cross
section into model-independent bounds on the product of the branching ratios

class of models could possibly produce a signal of the required size at the
LHC. Our work sets up a general framework, outlines how it operates for
resonances with different numbers of production and decay modes, and analyzes
cases of current experimental interest, including resonances decaying to
dibosons, diphotons, dileptons, or dijets. If the LHC experiments were to
report their searches for new resonances beyond the standard model in the
simplified limits variable $\zeta$ defined in this paper, that would make it
far easier to avoid blind alleys and home in on the most likely candidate

considered galaxies for which distances not based on the the SN Ia method are

of the absolute magnitudes on the color of the SN Ia, the oxygen abundances of

demonstrate that our previous result suggesting a metallicity-dependence on the
SN Ia luminosity for not-reddened SNe Ia (Moreno-Raya et al. 2016) can be
extended to our whole sample. These results reinforce the need of including a
metallicity proxy, such as the oxygen abundance of the host galaxy, to minimize

effect for mixed lists. In the framework here proposed, these behaviors emerge
as an effect of the different level of localization of short and long words in

a clustering property in phase space, which facilitates associative retrieval.
The standard word-length effect arises directly from this property, and the

amplification of the field. We find magnetic field reversals occur when the
velocity jump across the spiral shock is above $\approx$20km s$^{-1}$,
occurring where the velocity change is highest, typically at the inner Lindblad
resonance (ILR) in our models. Reversals also occur at corotation, where the
direction of the velocity field reverses in the co-rotating frame of a spiral
arm. They occur earlier with a stronger amplitude spiral potential, and later
or not at all with weaker or no spiral arms. The presence of a reversal at a
radii of around 4--6 kpc in our fiducial model is consistent with a reversal
identified in the Milky Way, though we caution that alternative Galaxy models
could give a similar reversal. We find that relatively high resolution, a few
million particles in SPMHD, is required to produce consistent behaviour of the
magnetic field. Amplification of the magnetic field occurs in the models, and
while some may be genuinely attributable to differential rotation or spiral
arms, some may be a numerical artefact. We check our results using Athena,

Earth predicted by these models are consistent with in situ measurements of
WIND. We also employ the Drag-Based Model (DBM) as a comparison, and find that
it predicts a steeper deceleration than the shock models after the rapid
deceleration phase. The predictions of DBM at 1 AU agree with the following
ICME or sheath structure, not the preceding shock. These results demonstrate
the applicability of the shock models used here for future arrival time
prediction of interplanetary shocks associated with fast CMEs.

To this purpose, in this work current-injecting micro-electrodes were
fabricated in bulk diamond for NV charge state control. Buried (i.e. 3 {\mu}m
in depth) graphitic micro-electrodes with spacing of 9 {\mu}m were created in
single-crystal diamond substrates by means of a 6 MeV C scanning micro-beam.
The high breakdown field of diamond was exploited to electrically control the
variation in the relative population of the negative (NV-) and neutral (NV0)
charge states of sub-superficial NV centers located in the inter- electrode gap
regions, without incurring into current discharges. Photoluminescence spectra
acquired from the biased electrodes exhibited an electrically induced increase
up to 40% in the NV- population at the expense of the NV0 charge state. The
variation in the relative charge state populations showed a linear dependence
from the injected current at applied biases smaller than 250 V, and was
interpreted as the result of electron trapping at NV sites, consistently with
the Space Charge Limited Current interpretation of the abrupt current increase
observed at 300 V bias voltage. In correspondence of such trap-filling-induced
transition to a high-current regime, a strong electroluminescent emission from
the NV0 centers was observed. In the high-current-injection regime, a decrease
in the NV- population was observed, in contrast with the results obtained at
lower bias voltages. These results disclose new possibilities in the electrical
control of the charge state of NV centers located in the diamond bulk, which
are characterized by longer spin coherence times.

without the support of any visual inspection of neither the images nor the
ellipticity/P.A. radial profiles, at extracting a fairly pure sample of barred
LTGs among thousands of optical images from the SDSS. The procedure relies on
the methods described in Consolandi et al. (2016) to robustly extract the
photometrical properties of a large sample of local SDSS galaxies and is
tailored to extract bars on the basis of their well-known peculiarities in
their P.A. and ellipticity profiles. It has been run on a sample of 5853
galaxies in the Coma and Local supercluster. The procedure extracted for each
galaxy a color, an ellipticity and a position angle radial profile of the
ellipses fitted to the isophotes. Examining automatically the profiles of 922
face-on late-type galaxies (B/A >0.7) the procedure found that ~ 36 % are
barred. The local bar fraction strongly increases with stellar mass. The sample
of barred galaxies is used to construct a set of template radial color profiles
in order to test the impact of the barred galaxy population on the average
color profiles shown by Consolandi et al. (2016) and to test the bar-quenching
scenario proposed in Gavazzi et al. (2015). The radial color profile of barred
galaxy shows that bars are on average redder than their surrounding disk
producing an outside-in gradient toward red in correspondence of their
corotation radius. The distribution of the extension of the deprojected length
of the bar suggests that bars have strong impacts on the gradients of averaged
color profiles. The dependence of the profiles on the mass is consistent with
the bar-quenching scenario, i.e. more massive barred galaxies have redder
colors (hence older stellar population and suppressed star formation) inside
their corotation radius with respect to their lower mass counterparts.

the former can have more refined topological structures. We then propose the

complementarity between the two detector materials so that simultaneous

3-body charged lepton decays and radiative decays and we take as example the
$A_4$ discrete symmetry. In $A_4$ models, a $Z_3$ residual symmetry roughly
holds in the charged lepton sector for the realisation of tri-bimaximal mixing
at leading order. The only processes allowed by this symmetry are $\tau^-\to

are suppressed by small $Z_3$-breaking effects. These processes also depend on
the representation the flavon is in, whether pseudo-real (case i) or complex
(case ii). We calculate the decay rates for all processes for each case and
derive their strong connection with lepton flavour mixing. In case i, sum rules
for the branching ratios of these processes are obtained, with typical examples
$\text{Br}(\tau^-\to \mu^+ e^- e^-) \approx \text{Br}(\tau^-\to e^+ \mu^-

masses and current experimental constraints allow the electroweak scale and the
flavon masses to be around hundreds of GeV. Our discussion can be generalised

  and Rate-Energy Tradeoff","submitted for possible journal publication",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The design of Wireless Information and Power Transfer (WIPT) has so far
relied on an oversimplified and inaccurate linear model of the energy
harvester. In this paper, we depart from this linear model and design WIPT
considering the rectifier nonlinearity. We develop a tractable model of the
rectifier nonlinearity that is flexible enough to cope with general
multicarrier modulated input waveforms. Leveraging that model, we motivate and
introduce a novel WIPT architecture relying on the superposition of
multi-carrier unmodulated and modulated waveforms at the transmitter. The
superposed WIPT waveforms are optimized as a function of the channel state
information so as to characterize the rate-energy region of the whole system.
Analysis and numerical results illustrate the performance of the derived
waveforms and WIPT architecture and highlight that nonlinearity radically
changes the design of WIPT. We make key and refreshing observations. First,
analysis (confirmed by circuit simulations) shows that modulated and
unmodulated waveforms are not equally suitable for wireless power delivery,
namely modulation being beneficial in single-carrier transmissions but
detrimental in multi-carrier transmissions. Second, a multicarrier unmodulated
waveform (superposed to a multi-carrier modulated waveform) is useful to
enlarge the rate-energy region of WIPT. Third, a combination of power splitting
and time sharing is in general the best strategy. Fourth, a non-zero mean
Gaussian input distribution outperforms the conventional capacity-achieving
zero-mean Gaussian input distribution in multi-carrier transmissions. Fifth,

An invited review article",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Plasmon in graphene possesses many unique properties. It originates from the
collective motion of massless Dirac fermions and the carrier density dependence
is distinctively different from conventional plasmons. In addition, graphene
plasmon is highly tunable and shows strong energy confinement capability. Most
intriguing, as an atom-thin layer, graphene and its plasmon are very sensitive
to the immediate environment. Graphene plasmons strongly couple to polar
phonons of the substrate, molecular vibrations of the adsorbates, and lattice
vibrations of other atomically thin layers. In this review paper, we'll present
the most important advances in grapene plasmonics field. The topics include
terahertz plasmons, mid-infrared plasmons, plasmon-phonon interactions and
potential applications. Graphene plasmonics opens an avenue for reconfigurable
metamaterials and metasurfaces. It's an exciting and promising new subject in
the nanophotonics and plasmonics research field.

production, from researchers to institutions. Against this background, we
analyzed a citation network comprised of 837 million references produced by
32.6 million publications over the period 1965-2012, allowing for a temporal
analysis of the `attention economy' in science. Unlike previous studies, we
analyzed the entire probability distribution of reference ages - the time
difference between a citing and cited paper - thereby capturing previously
overlooked trends. Over this half-century period we observe a narrowing range
of attention - both classic and recent literature are being cited increasingly
less, pointing to the important role of socio-technical processes. To better
understand the impact of exponential growth on the underlying knowledge network
we develop a network-based model, featuring the redirection of scientific
attention via publications' reference lists, and validate the model against
several empirical benchmarks. We then use the model to test the causal impact
of real paradigm shifts, thereby providing guidance for science policy
analysis. In particular, we show how perturbations to the growth rate of
scientific output affects the reference age distribution and the functionality
of the vast science citation network as an aid for the search & retrieval of

object-oriented languages, which have led to important advances in type systems
for aliasing control. However, their large-scale adoption has turned out to be
a surprisingly difficult challenge. While new language designs show promise,
they do not address the need of aliasing control in existing languages.
  This paper presents a new approach to isolation and uniqueness in an
existing, widely-used language, Scala. The approach is unique in the way it
addresses some of the most important obstacles to the adoption of type system
extensions for aliasing control. First, adaptation of existing code requires
only a minimal set of annotations. Only a single bit of information is required
per class. Surprisingly, the paper shows that this information can be provided
by the object-capability discipline, widely-used in program security. We
formalize our approach as a type system and prove key soundness theorems. The
type system is implemented for the full Scala language, providing, for the
first time, a sound integration with Scala's local type inference. Finally, we
empirically evaluate the conformity of existing Scala open-source code on a

Galactic sources as an excess of cosmic ray air showers arriving from the

can typically travel 10 ($E$ / PeV) pc before decay. Two searches are performed

approximately -50$^{\circ}$ in declination. No significant excess is found. A
targeted search is also performed, looking for significant correlation with
candidate sources in different target sets. This search uses a higher energy
cut (100 PeV) since most target objects lie beyond 1 kpc. The target sets
include pulsars with confirmed TeV energy photon fluxes and high-mass X-ray
binaries. No significant correlation is found for any target set. Flux upper
limits are determined for both searches, which can constrain Galactic neutron

using distances measures from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Type Ia
Supernovae, finding that at $z<0.6$ the recovered shape of the expansion
history is less than 5 % different than that of a standard LCDM model. These
probes also provide a model insensitive constraint on the low-redshift standard
ruler, measuring directly the combination $r_s h$ where $H_0=h \times 100$
km/s/Mpc and $r_s$ is the sound horizon at radiation drag (the standard ruler),
traditionally constrained by CMB observations. Thus $r_s$ and $H_0$ provide
absolute scales for distance measurements (anchors) at opposite ends of the
observable Universe. We calibrate the cosmic distance ladder and obtain a
model-independent determination of the standard ruler for acoustic scale,
$r_s$. The tension in $H_0$ reflects a mismatch between our determination of
$r_s$ and its standard, CMB-inferred value. Without including high-l Planck CMB
polarization data (i.e., only considering the ""recommended baseline"" low-l

visual context could be of great help, but there are still very few papers that

processes information along two independent pathways. Our model learns to
combine local and global appearance in a complementary way, such that together
form a powerful classifier. We test our dual-stream network on the task of
buildings segmentation in aerial images and obtain state-of-the-art results on

a freeing of gluons coming from either the proton wave function or from the
nucleus wave function. These (apparently) very different pictures must lead to
the same result and the purpose of this paper is to see how that happens. The
focus is on gluons having $k_\perp\sim Q_S$ or gluons in the scaling region
$k_\perp/Q_S\gg 1$. In the McLerran-Venugopalan(MV) model with $k_\perp\sim
Q_S$ we are able to derive gluon production in a way that (graphically)
manifestly shows $k_\perp$-factorization in terms of the number density of
gluons in the nuclear wave function. We presume that this picture, and
$k_\perp$-factorization, continues to hold in the presence of small-$x$
evolution although we have not been able to explicitly verify this. Our result
is in agreement with usual $k_\perp$-factorization where the gluon number
density of the nucleus does not appear in an explicit way.

far from atomic resonances, the vector and tensor contributions are
two-order-of-magnitude smaller than the scalar contribution, whereas for the

Array (SKA), which will be the most sensitive and largest radio telescope ever
constructed, could greatly contribute to the detection, survey and
characterization of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). By the SKA, it will be possible to
perform the follow up of GRBs even for several months. This approach would be
extremely useful to extend the Spectrum Energetic Distribution (SED) from the
gamma to the to radio band and would increase the number of radio detectable
GRBs. In principle, the SKA could help to understand the physics of GRBs by
setting constraints on theoretical models. This goal could be achieved by
taking into account multiple observations at different wavelengths in order to
obtain a deeper insight of the sources. Here, we present an estimation of GRB
radio detections, showing that the GRBs can really be observed by the SKA. The
approach that we present consists in determining blind detection rates derived
by a very large sample consisting of merging several GRB catalogues observed by
current missions as Swift, Fermi, Agile and INTEGRAL and by previous missions
as BeppoSAX, CGRO, GRANAT, HETE-2, Ulysses and Wind. The final catalogue counts
7516 distinct sources. We compute the fraction of GRBs that could be observed
by the SKA at high and low frequencies, above its observable sky. Considering
the planned SKA sensitivity and through an extrapolation based on previous
works and observations, we deduce the minimum fluence in the range 15-150 keV.
This is the energy interval where a GRB should emit to be detectable in the
radio band by the SKA. Results seem consistent with observational capabilities.

arbitrarily distributed among the $n$ network nodes, and the goal is to
disseminate all the $n$ tokens to every node. Our focus is on token-forwarding
algorithms, which do not manipulate tokens in any way other than storing,

static network, but a basic open question for dynamic networks is the existence
of a distributed protocol that can do significantly better than an easily

  In previous work, it has been shown that under adaptive adversaries, every
token forwarding algorithm requires $\Omega(n^2/\log n)$ rounds. In this paper,
we study oblivious adversaries, which differ from adaptive adversaries in one
crucial aspect--- they are oblivious to random choices made by the protocol. We
present an $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{3/2})$ lower bound under an oblivious adversary
for RANDDIFF, a natural algorithm in which neighbors exchange a token chosen
uniformly at random from the difference of their token sets. We also present an
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^{4/3})$ bound under a stronger notion of oblivious adversary

centralized algorithm that completes gossip in $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ rounds. We

conservation laws or systems in which the characteristic decomposition is
expensive to compute. Solving such equations using finite volumes or
Discontinuous Galerkin requires a numerical flux function which solves local
Riemann problems at cell interfaces. There are various methods to express the
numerical flux function. On the one end, there is the robust but very diffusive
Lax-Friedrichs solver; on the other end the upwind Godunov solver which
respects all resulting waves. The drawback of the latter method is the costly
computation of the eigensystem.
  This work presents a family of simple first order Riemann solvers, named
HLLX$\omega$, which avoid solving the eigensystem. The new method reproduces
all waves of the system with less dissipation than other solvers with similar
input and effort, such as HLL and FORCE. The family of Riemann solvers can be
seen as an extension or generalization of the methods introduced by Degond et
al. \cite{DegondPeyrardRussoVilledieu1999}. We only require the same number of
input values as HLL, namely the globally fastest wave speeds in both
directions, or an estimate of the speeds. Thus, the new family of Riemann
solvers is particularly efficient for large systems of conservation laws when
the spectral decomposition is expensive to compute or no explicit expression

interferometric detection of cantilever displacement. The key idea of this
system is to use a wavelength-tunable laser source. The wavelength is subject
to proportional-integral control, which is used to keep the cavity detuning
constant during a measurement. Under this control, the change in wavelength is
proportional to the cantilever displacement. Using this technique, we can
measure large displacements ($>1\ \mathrm{\mu m}$) without degradation of
sensitivity. We apply this technique to high-frequency electron spin resonance
spectroscopy and succeed in removing an irregular background signal that arises
from the constantly varying sensitivity of the interferometer.

  section derives conservation of current from the continuity equation.
  Revision 4: discussion of flux of charge and current in a resistor, on p. 13",,,,"physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Charges are everywhere because most atoms are charged. Chemical bonds are
formed by electrons with their charge. Charges move and interact according to
Maxwell's equations in space and in atoms where the equations of
electrodynamics are embedded in Schroedinger's equation as the potential.
Maxwell's equations are universal, valid inside atoms and between stars from
times much shorter than those of atomic motion (0.1 femtoseconds) to years (32
mega-seconds). Maxwell's equations enforce the conservation of current.
Analysis shows that the electric field can take on whatever value is needed to
ensure conservation of current. The properties of matter rearrange themselves
to satisfy Maxwell's equations and conservation of current. Conservation of
current is as universal as Maxwell's equations themselves. Yet equations of
electrodynamics find little place in the literature of material physics,
chemistry, or biochemistry. Kinetic models of chemistry and Markov treatments
of atomic motion are ordinary differential equations in time and do not satisfy
conservation of current unless modified significantly. Systems at equilibrium,
without macroscopic flow, have thermal fluctuating currents that are conserved
according to the Maxwell equations although their macroscopic averages are
zero. The macroscopic consequences of atomic scale fluctuating thermal currents
are not known but are likely to be substantial because of the nonlinear
interactions in systems like these, in which 'everything interacts with
everything else'.
  Conclusion: current needs to be conserved in models of material systems, even
in simplified versions.

domains. Domain theory is a fundamental component of theoretical computer
science, providing mathematical models of computational processes. Random
variables are the mainstay of probability theory. Since computational models
increasingly involve probabilistic aspects, it's only natural to explore the
relationship between these two areas. Our main results show how to cast results
about random variables using a domain-theoretic approach. The pay-off is an
extension of the results from probability measures to sub-probability measures.
We also use our approach to extend the class of domains for which we can
classify the domain structure of the space of sub-probability measures.

is filtered in the correlation signal detection. Numerical results are
presented for OFDM systems with 4 and 16 PSK modulation, 200 OFDM bins and baud

gravitational waves that take away 5 per cent of the total mass of two merging
black holes points out on the importance of considering varying gravitational
mass of a system in the framework of the Einstein general theory of relativity.
We calculate the acceleration of a particle in the non-stationary field of a
quasi-spherical system composed of a large number of objects emitting
gravitational waves. It is shown that reduction of the gravitational mass of
the system due to emitting gravitational waves leads to a repulsive
gravitational force that diminishes with time but never disappears. This
repulsive force may be related to the observed expansion of the Universe.

organisations adapt to changes in the environment and improve. Governments,
institutions and firms that innovate are more likely to prosper and stand the
test of time; those that fail to do so fall behind their competitors and
succumb to market and environmental change. Yet despite steady advances in our
understanding of evolution, what drives innovation remains elusive. On the one
hand, organizations invest heavily in systematic strategies to drive
innovation. On the other, historical analysis and individual experience suggest
that serendipity plays a significant role in the discovery process. To unify
these two perspectives, we analyzed the mathematics of innovation as a search
process for viable designs across a universe of building blocks. We then tested
our insights using historical data from language, gastronomy and technology. By
measuring the number of makeable designs as we acquire more components, we
observed that the relative usefulness of different components is not fixed, but
cross each other over time. When these crossovers are unanticipated, they
appear to be the result of serendipity. But when we can predict crossovers
ahead of time, they offer an opportunity to strategically increase the growth
of our product space. Thus we find that the serendipitous and strategic visions
of innovation can be viewed as different manifestations of the same thing: the
changing importance of component building blocks over time.
