inference after using the data to select a reasonable statistical model. We
propose MAGIC, a new method for selective inference that is general, powerful
and tractable. MAGIC is a method for selective inference after solving a convex
optimization problem with smooth loss and $\ell_1$ penalty. Randomization is
incorporated into the optimization problem to boost statistical power. Through
reparametrization, MAGIC reduces the problem into a sampling problem with
simple constraints. MAGIC applies to many $\ell_1$ penalized optimization
problem including the Lasso, logistic Lasso and neighborhood selection in
graphical models, all of which we consider in this paper.

  Identification and Inference",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nonmonotone missing data arise routinely in empirical studies of social and
health sciences, and when ignored, can induce selection bias and loss of
efficiency. In practice, it is common to account for nonresponse under a
missing-at-random assumption which although convenient, is rarely appropriate
when nonresponse is nonmonotone. Likelihood and Bayesian missing data
methodologies often require specification of a parametric model for the full
data law, thus a priori ruling out any prospect for semiparametric inference.
In this paper, we propose an all-purpose approach which delivers semiparametric
inferences when missing data are nonmonotone and not at random. The approach is
based on a discrete choice model (DCM) as a means to generate a large class of
nonmonotone nonresponse mechanisms that are nonignorable. Sufficient conditions
for nonparametric identification are given, and a general framework for fully
parametric and semiparametric inference under an arbitrary DCM is proposed.
Special consideration is given to the case of logit discrete choice nonresponse
model (LDCM) for which we describe generalizations of inverse-probability
weighting, pattern-mixture estimation, doubly robust estimation and multiply
robust estimation.

system is one of these applications. Here, a large group of mobile robots that
are operating in communication-limited, and sensory-limited modes are required
to cope with each others presence as well as the contents of their environment
while preserving their ability to reach their preset, independent goals. This
work explores the construction of a decentralized traffic controller for a
large group of agents sharing a workspace with stationary forbidden regions.
The suggested multi-agent motion controller is complete provided that a lenient
condition on the geometry of the workspace is upheld. It has a low
computational effort that linearly increases with the number of agents. The
controller is also self-organizing; therefore, it is able to deal, on its own,
with incomplete information and unexpected situations. In addition to the
above, the controller has an open structure to enable any agent to join or
leave the group without the remaining agents having to adjust the manner in
which they function. To meet these requirements, a definition of
decentralization is suggested. This definition equates decentralization to
self-organization in a group of agents operating in an artificial life mode.
The definition is used to provide guidelines for the construction of the
multi-agent controller. The controller is realized using the potential field
approach. Theoretical developments, as well as simulation results, are
provided.

Seyfert 1 galaxies and show broad features around 1 keV that has been

required by the best fitted blurred reflection models. Given the importance of
these lines, we explore the possibility if rapid variability of spectral
parameters may introduce broad bumps/dips artificially in the time averaged
spectrum, which may then be mistaken as broadened lines. We tested this
hypothesis by performing time resolved spectroscopy using long (> 100 ks)
XMM-Newton observations and by dividing it into segments with typical exposure
of few ks. We extracted spectra from each such segment and modelled using a two
component phenomenological model consisting of a power law to represent hard
component and a black body to represent the soft emission. As expected both the
sources showed variations in the spectral parameters. Using these variation
trends, we simulated model spectra for each segment and then co-added to get a
combined simulated spectrum. In the simulated spectra, we found no broad
features below 1 keV and in particular no deviation near 0.9 keV as seen in the
real average spectra. This implies that the broad Fe L? line that is seen in
the spectra of these sources is not an artifact of the variation of spectral

from independent Gaussian linear measurements each of which is quantized to $b$
bits. Our interest is in linear approaches to signal recovery, where ""linear""
means that non-linearity resulting from quantization is ignored and the
observations are treated as if they arose from a linear measurement model.
Specifically, the focus is on a generalization of a method for one-bit
observations due to Plan and Vershynin [\emph{IEEE~Trans. Inform. Theory,
\textbf{59} (2013), 482--494}]. At the heart of the present paper is a precise
characterization of the optimal trade-off between the number of measurements
$m$ and the bit depth per measurement $b$ given a total budget of $B = m \cdot
b$ bits when the goal is to minimize the $\ell_2$-error in estimating the
signal. It turns out that the choice $b = 1$ is optimal for estimating the unit
vector (direction) corresponding to the signal for any level of additive
Gaussian noise before quantization as well as for a specific model of
adversarial noise, while the choice $b = 2$ is optimal for estimating the
direction and the norm (scale) of the signal. Moreover, Lloyd-Max quantization
is shown to be an optimal quantization scheme w.r.t. $\ell_2$-estimation error.
Our analysis is corroborated by numerical experiments showing nearly perfect
agreement with our theoretical predictions. The paper is complemented by an
empirical comparison to alternative methods of signal recovery taking the
non-linearity resulting from quantization into account. The results of that
comparison point to a regime change depending on the noise level: in a
low-noise setting, linear signal recovery falls short of more sophisticated
competitors while being competitive in moderate- and high-noise settings.

and low-lying electron-hole pair excitations. In the limit of weak coupling,
electron-hole pair excitations can be seen as exerting frictional forces on
adsorbates that enhance energy transfer and facilitate vibrational relaxation
or hot-electron mediated chemistry. We have recently reported on the relevance
of tensorial properties of electronic friction [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 217601
(2016)] in dynamics at surfaces. Here we present the underlying implementation
of tensorial electronic friction based on Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory
for condensed phase and cluster systems. Using local atomic-orbital basis sets,
we calculate nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements and evaluate the full
electronic friction tensor in the classical limit. Our approach is numerically
stable and robust as shown by a detailed convergence analysis. We furthermore
benchmark the accuracy of our approach by calculation of vibrational relaxation
rates and lifetimes for a number of diatomic molecules at metal surfaces. We
find friction-induced mode-coupling between neighboring CO adsorbates on
Cu(100) in a c(2x2) overlayer to be important to understand experimental
findings.

outstanding goals in spintronics. Topological insulators (TIs) have been
recognized as a promising electrically controlled spin source thanks to the
strong spin-orbit coupling and in particular, the spin-momentum locked
topological surface states (TSS) supporting helically spin polarized currents.
Many TI materials such as Bi-based chalcogenides are also layered 2D materials
and can be incorporated into van der Waals (vdW) coupled heterostructures,
opening the possibility of the utilization of TIs for electrical spin injection
into other 2D materials. Here, we demonstrate electrical injection of helically
spin-polarized current into graphene through a 3D TI in a mechanically stacked
heterostructure between Bi2Te2Se (a TI) and chemical vapor deposition
(CVD)-grown graphene, using the spin potentiometric measurement. When a dc
current is flowing from the TI to graphene, we detect a striking step-like
voltage change (spin signal) in both the TI and graphene using ferromagnetic
(FM) probes. The sign of the spin signal can be reversed by reversing the
direction of the dc bias current, and the corresponding amplitude of the spin
signal increases linearly with the bias current, indicative of a
current-induced helical spin polarization in both TI and graphene. In contrast,
the graphene itself exhibits usual nonlocal spin valve signal when the spins
are injected using an FM electrode. We discuss possible origins of the helical
spin polarization injected into the graphene in our TI/graphene heterostructure
that may include TSS as well as the spin-orbit coupled Rashba states. Our
findings show electrical injection of a spin helical current into graphene
through a TI and demonstrate TIs as potential spin sources for future
spintronic devices wherein spin manipulation is achieved electrically.

more compact in the integrated photonics industry, and one of the important
questions for manufacturers and design engineers is how to quantify the effect
of the finite cladding thickness on the modal confinement loss of photonic
waveguides. This requires at least six to seven digits accuracy for the
computation of propagation constant $\beta$ since the modal confinement loss is
proportional to the imaginary part of $\beta$ that is six to seven orders of
magnitude smaller than its real part by the industrial standard. In this paper,
we present an accurate and efficient method to compute the propagation constant
of electromagnetic modes of photonic waveguides with arbitrary number of
(nonsmooth) inclusions in a layered media. The method combines a
well-conditioned boundary integral equation formulation for photonic waveguides
which requires the discretization of the material interface only, and efficient
Sommerfeld integral representations to treat the effect of the layered medium.
Our scheme is capable of calculating the propagation loss of the
electromagnetic modes with high fidelity, even for waveguides with corners
imbedded in a cladding material of finite thickness. The numerical results,
with more than $10$-digit accuracy, show quantitatively that the modal
confinement loss of the rectangular waveguide increases exponentially fast as
the cladding thickness decreases.

it is found that both FSRQs and GeV NLS1s in different stages and in different

that the variations of observed luminosities may be essentially due to the
Doppler boosting effect. And the universal $\delta$-$L_{\rm c}$ relation
between FSRQs and GeV NLS1s in different stages may be further evidence that
the particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms for the two kinds of sources

effects on cosmic reionization and the Lyman alpha forest. As a continuation of
our previous work on Pop III binary X-rays (Xu et al. 2014), we use the Pop III

self-consistent cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the
formation of the first galaxies, to calculate the X-ray luminosity density and
background over the redshift range 20 > z > 7.6. As we find that Pop III star
formation continues at a low, nearly constant rate to the end of reionization,
X-rays are being continuously produced at significant rates compared to other
possible X-ray sources, such as AGNs and normal X-ray binaries during the same
period of time. We estimate that Pop III binaries produce approximately 6 eV of

different monochromatic photon energies. KeV X-rays redshift and accumulate to
produce a strong X-ray background spectrum extending to roughly 500 eV. The

with those previously known. We show that the (Q)RACs are $d$-parity-oblivious,
generalizing ordinary parity-obliviousness. We further investigate optimization
of the success probabilities. For $d=2$, we use the measure operators of the
previously best known solutions, but improve the encoding states to give a
higher success probability. We conjecture that for maximal $(n=4^m-1,m,p)$
QRACs, $p=\frac{1+\frac{1}{(\sqrt{3}+1)^m-1}}{2}$ is possible and show that it
is an upper bound for the measure operators that we use. When we compare
$(n,m,p_q)$ QRACs with classical $(n,2m,p_c)$ RACs, we can always find $p_q\geq
p_c$, but the classical code gives information about every input bit
simultaneously, while the QRAC only gives information about a subset. For
several different $(n,2,p)$ QRACs, we see the same trade-off, as the best $p$
values are obtained when the number of bits that can be obtained simultaneously
is as small as possible. The trade-off is connected to parity-obliviousness,
since high certainty information about several bits can be used to calculate
probabilities for parities of subsets.

to exceedingly high rejection of potentially suitable services. Furthermore,

exploiting the redundant degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) inherent in the large-scale

the frequency-domain precoded signals, with the aim of reducing the PAPRs of
their time-domain counterpart signals. Meanwhile, the additive perturbation
signal associated with each tone is constrained to lie in the null-space of its
associated channel matrix, such that it does not cause any multi-user inference

investigate this, we perform a bifurcation analysis of the system and present
its bifurcation diagram in the plane of the two feedback strengths. It is
organized by Hopf-Hopf bifurcation points that give rise to curves of torus
bifurcation and associated two-frequency dynamics in the form of invariant tori

requires the expansion of the functional defining the state-dependent DDE in a
power series whose terms up to order three only contain constant delays. We
implemented this expansion and the computation of the normal form coefficients
in Matlab using symbolic differentiation. Numerical continuation of the torus
bifurcation curves confirms the correctness of our normal form calculations.
Moreover, it enables us to compute the curves of torus bifurcations more
globally, and to find associated curves of saddle-node bifurcations of periodic
orbits that bound the resonance tongues. The tori themselves are computed and
visualized in a three-dimensional projection, as well as the planar trace of a

infrared spectra for different types of SLs are calculated. The narrow peaks
clustered in groups that couldn't be explained before in Nakamura's et al. for

and differences that we discuss in the paper, we notice that many transitions
that were experimentally observed but theoretically forbidden, are now
perfectly possible. Since the number of matrix-elements allowed by the SSR is
generally too large, we devote the second part of this paper to show that one
can obtain the same spectra when, besides the SSR, other leading order
selection rules closely related to intra-subband symmetries are introduced.
These rules reduce the number of matrix evaluations from $\sim n^2$$n_cn_v/2$
to $\sim n$$n_cn_v/2$, i.e., depending on the SL, from about 1000 to 100. We
comment also on a third rule, that picks up the contributions of the surface
and edge states, and show that it reduces further the number of transitions to
$N_s\leq n_cn_v$. With these rules, the main peaks are conserved and their
number practically matches with that of the actual spectrum. Excellent

though it can be completed in a short amount of time, has no clear correlation
to safety benefits in the real world. To avoid the aforementioned problems, we
propose Accelerated Evaluation, focusing on the car-following scenario. The
stochastic human-controlled vehicle (HV) motions are modeled based on 1.3
million miles of naturalistic driving data collected by the University of
Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment Program. The statistics of the HV
behaviors are then modified to generate more intense interactions between HVs
and AVs to accelerate the evaluation procedure. The Importance Sampling theory
was used to ensure that the safety benefits of AVs are accurately assessed
under accelerated tests. Crash, injury and conflict rates for a simulated AV
are simulated to demonstrate the proposed approach. Results show that test
duration is reduced by a factor of 300 to 100,000 compared with the
non-accelerated (naturalistic) evaluation. In other words, the proposed
techniques have great potential for accelerating the AV evaluation process.

define the concept of thresholding as a process of determining a decision
boundary in the presence of a tunable parameter. The threshold is the maximum
value of this tunable parameter where the conditions of a certain decision are
satisfied. We show that thresholding is applicable not only for linear
classifiers but also for non-linear classifiers. We show that this is the
implicit assumption for many approaches to deal with class imbalance in linear
classifiers. We then extend this paradigm beyond linear classification and show
how non-linear classification can be dealt with under this umbrella framework
of thresholding. The proposed method can be used for outlier detection in many
real-life scenarios like in manufacturing. In advanced manufacturing units,
where the manufacturing process has matured over time, the number of instances
(or parts) of the product that need to be rejected (based on a strict regime of
quality tests) becomes relatively rare and are defined as outliers. How to
detect these rare parts or outliers beforehand? How to detect combination of
conditions leading to these outliers? These are the questions motivating our
research. This paper focuses on prediction of outliers and conditions leading
to outliers using classification. We address the problem of outlier detection
using classification. The classes are good parts (those passing the quality
tests) and bad parts (those failing the quality tests and can be considered as
outliers). The rarity of outliers transforms this problem into a
class-imbalanced classification problem.

box surface (i.e. third kind or Robin's ones), for a wide range of physically
reasonable values of system parameters. The reason is that such boundary
conditions could yield a large magnitude of electronic wavefunction in some
sector of the box boundary, what in turn promotes atomic displacement from the
box center towards this part of the boundary, and so the underlying SO(3)
symmetry spontaneously breaks. The emerging Goldstone modes, coinciding with
rotations around the box center, restore the symmetry by spreading the atom
over a spherical shell localized at some distances from the box center. Atomic
confinement inside the cavity proceeds dynamically -- due to the boundary
condition the deformation of electronic wavefunction near the boundary works as
a spring, that returns the atomic nuclei back into the box volume.

galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshifts (z > 1.7) that are characterised by
their relative infrared faintness, resulting in enormous radio-to-infrared flux
density ratios of up to several thousand. We aim to test the hypothesis that
IFRS are young AGN, particularly GHz peaked-spectrum (GPS) and compact
steep-spectrum (CSS) sources that have a low frequency turnover. We use the
rich radio data set available for the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey
fields, covering the frequency range between 150 MHz and 34 GHz with up to 19
wavebands from different telescopes, and build radio spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) for 34 IFRS. We then study the radio properties of this
class of object with respect to turnover, spectral index, and behaviour towards
higher frequencies. We also present the highest-frequency radio observations of
an IFRS, observed with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer at 105 GHz, and model
the multi-wavelength and radio-far-infrared SED of this source. We find IFRS
usually follow single power laws down to observed frequencies of around 150
MHz. Mostly, the radio SEDs are steep, but we also find ultra-steep SEDs. In
particular, IFRS show statistically significantly steeper radio SEDs than the
broader RL AGN population. Our analysis reveals that the fractions of GPS and
CSS sources in the population of IFRS are consistent with the fractions in the
broader RL AGN population. We find that at least 18% of IFRS contain young AGN,
although the fraction might be significantly higher as suggested by the steep
SEDs and the compact morphology of IFRS. The detailed multi-wavelength SED
modelling of one IFRS shows that it is different from ordinary AGN, although it
is consistent with a composite starburst-AGN model with a star formation rate
of 170 solar masses per year.

scattering at the dislocation cores, where the scattering rate is stronger than
that presented by Klemens. Within an effective diameter of about 9 nm around
their cores, the dislocations locally scatter phonons, resulting in a
dramatical density-dependent reduction of thermal conductivity for a
dislocation density larger than 10^14 m^-2.

BCS-superconductor after proper intercalation. In this study, using
first-principles calculations, the favorable intercalation sites for some
alkali metals and alkaline earths have been identified for Blue-P bilayer and
the stacking configuration of bilayer is changed. Then the blue phosphorus
bilayer transforms from a semiconductor to a metal due to the charge transfer
from metal to phosphorus. Own to the strong electron-phonon coupling, isotropic
superconducting state is induced and the calculated transition temperatures are
$20.4$, $20.1$, and $14.4$K for Li-, Na-, and Mg-intercaltion, respectively,

nonlinearities results in complex cavity dynamics that is of high scientific
interest but is still far from well understood. Here, we demonstrate that the
interaction between the fundamental and the second-harmonic waves can provide
an entirely new way of phase-matching for four-wave mixing in optical
microresonators, enabling the generation of optical frequency combs in the
normal dispersion regime, under conditions where comb creation is ordinarily
prohibited. We derive new coupled time-domain mean-field equations and obtain
simulation results showing good qualitative agreement with our experimental
observations. Our findings provide a novel way of overcoming the dispersion
limit for simultaneous Kerr comb formation and second-harmonic generation,
which might prove especially important in the near-visible to visible range
where several atomic transitions commonly used for stabilization of optical
clocks are located and where the large normal material dispersion is likely to
dominate.

potentially disclose more information than was originally intended. We perform
two case studies: First, we perform user de-anonymization by mimicking the
scenario of finding the identity of a user making anonymous posts within a
group of users. Empirical evaluation on a sample of real-world social network
profiles suggests that cross-platform aggregation introduces significant
performance gains in user identification. In the second task, we show that it
is possible to infer physical location visits of a user on the basis of shared

we can attain an improved inference performance. In some cases this performance
exceeds even the use of the user's full timeline.

firstly built-up from her/his exemplars of source facial photo and hand-drawn
sketch, and then its stylization for facial photo is transformed as a
style-transferring process of iterative refinement by looking-for and applying
best-fit cases in a sense of style optimization. Two models, fitness evaluation
model and parameter estimation model, are learned for case retrieval and
adaptation respectively from these cases. The fitness evaluation model is to
decide which case is best-fitted to the sketching of current interest, and the
parameter estimation model is to automate case adaptation. The resultant sketch
is synthesized progressively with an iterative loop of retrieval and adaptation
of candidate cases until the desired aesthetic style is achieved. To explore
the effectiveness and advantages of the novel approach, we experimentally

several experimental observations point to the existence of colonies in systems
with anisotropic interfaces. In this study, we extend the un- derstanding of
eutectic colonies to anisotropic systems, where only certain orientations of
the solid-liquid or solid-solid interfaces are thermodynamically stable.
Through phase field simulations in 2D and 3D, we have systematically probed the
colony formation dynamics and the resulting microstructures, as functions of
the pulling velocity and the relative orientation of the equilibrium interfaces
with that of the imposed tempera- ture gradient. We find that in 2D, stabler
finger spacings are selected with an increase in the magnitude of anisotropy
introduced, either in the solid-liquid or in the solid-solid interface. The
fingers have a well-defined orientation for the case of anisotropy in the
solid-liquid interface, with no fixed orientations for the lamellae
constituting the colony. For the case where anisotropy exists in the
solid-solid interface, the lamellae tend to orient themselves along the
direction of the imposed temperature gradient, with tilted solid-liquid
interfaces from the horizontal. The 3D simulations reveal existence of eutectic
spirals which might become tilted under certain orientations of the equilibrium
interfaces. Our simulations are able to explain several key features observed

toolkit of fine-grained complexity. Our first set of results is motivated by
the Bitonic TSP problem: given a set of $n$ points in the plane, compute a
shortest tour consisting of two monotone chains. It is a classic
dynamic-programming exercise to solve this problem in $O(n^2)$ time. While the
near-quadratic dependency of similar dynamic programs for Longest Common
Subsequence and Discrete Frechet Distance has recently been proven to be
essentially optimal under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, we show that
bitonic tours can be found in subquadratic time. More precisely, we present an
algorithm that solves bitonic TSP in $O(n \log^2 n)$ time and its bottleneck
version in $O(n \log^3 n)$ time. Our second set of results concerns the popular
$k$-OPT heuristic for TSP in the graph setting. More precisely, we study the
$k$-OPT decision problem, which asks whether a given tour can be improved by a
$k$-OPT move that replaces $k$ edges in the tour by $k$ new edges. A simple
algorithm solves $k$-OPT in $O(n^k)$ time for fixed $k$. For 2-OPT, this is
easily seen to be optimal. For $k=3$ we prove that an algorithm with a runtime
of the form $\tilde{O}(n^{3-\epsilon})$ exists if and only if All-Pairs
Shortest Paths in weighted digraphs has such an algorithm. The results for
$k=2,3$ may suggest that the actual time complexity of $k$-OPT is
$\Theta(n^k)$. We show that this is not the case, by presenting an algorithm
that finds the best $k$-move in $O(n^{\lfloor 2k/3 \rfloor + 1})$ time for
fixed $k \geq 3$. This implies that 4-OPT can be solved in $O(n^3)$ time,
matching the best-known algorithm for 3-OPT. Finally, we show how to beat the
quadratic barrier for $k=2$ in two important settings, namely for points in the
plane and when we want to solve 2-OPT repeatedly.

converges to the predictions of Bethe-Bloch theory, which shows good

Detailed simulations have been performed by considering non uniform heat load
employing the configurations U, I, Z for parallel microchannel systems with
water and nanofluids as the coolants. An Intel Core i7 4770 3.40 GHz quad core
processor has been mimicked using heat load data retrieved from a real
microprocessor with non-uniform core activity. The study clearly demonstrates
that there is a non-uniform thermal load induced temperature maldistribution
along with the already existent flow maldistribution induced temperature
maldistribution. The suitable configuration(s) for maximum possible overall
heat removal for a hot zone while maximizing the uniformity of cooling have
been tabulated. An Eulerian Lagrangian model of the nanofluids show that such
smart coolants not only reduce the hot spot core temperature, but also the hot
spot core region and thermal slip mechanisms of Brownian diffusion and
thermophoresis are at the crux of this. The present work conclusively shows
that high flow maldistribution leads to high thermal maldistribution, as the

the components responding before a specified deadline to produce approximate
results. However, they may skip a large proportion of components when load gets

AccuracyTrader that produces approximate results with small accuracy losses

AccuracyTrader also uses synopses to identify the parts of input data most

improve the produced results in order to minimize accuracy losses. We evaluated
AccuracyTrader using workloads in real services. The results show: (i)
AccuracyTrader reduces tail latency by over 40 times with accuracy losses of

cosmological models that seemingly has an answer for every observed phenomenon
in cosmology. More importantly, it serves as a bridge between the early quantum
fluctuations and the present-day classical structures. Although the transition
from quantum to classical is still not completely understood till date, there
are two assumptions made in the inflationary paradigm in this regard:
  (i) the modes (metric perturbations or fluctuations) behave classically once
they are well outside the Hubble radius and,
  (ii) once they become classical they stay classical and hence can be
described by standard perturbation theory after they re-enter the Hubble
radius.
  We critically examine these assumptions for the tensor modes of (linear)
metric perturbations in a toy three stage universe with (i) inflation, (ii)
radiation-dominated and (iii) late-time accelerated phases. The
quantum-to-classical transition for these modes is evident from the evolution
of Wigner function in phase space and its peaking on the classical trajectory.
However, a better approach to quantify the degree of classicality and study its
evolution was given by Mahajan and Padmanabhan [1] using a classicality
parameter constructed from the parameters of the Wigner function. We study the
evolution of the classicality parameter across the three phases and it turns
out that the first assumption holds true, there is emergence of classicality on
Hubble exit, however the latter assumption of ""once classical, always
classical"" seems to lie on a shaky ground.

where the transition depicts a temporal relation between two poses. Recognizing
actions thus involves learning a classifier sensitive to these pose transitions
as well as to static poses. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called
transitions forests, an ensemble of decision trees that both learn to
discriminate static poses and transitions between pairs of two independent
frames. During training, node splitting is driven by alternating two criteria:
the standard classification objective that maximizes the discrimination power
in individual frames, and the proposed one in pairwise frame transitions.
Growing the trees tends to group frames that have similar associated
transitions and share same action label incorporating temporal information that
was not available otherwise. Unlike conventional decision trees where the best
split in a node is determined independently of other nodes, the transition
forests try to find the best split of nodes jointly (within a layer) for
incorporating distant node transitions. When inferring the class label of a new
frame, it is passed down the trees and the prediction is made based on previous
frame predictions and the current one in an efficient and online manner. We
apply our method on varied skeleton action recognition and online detection
datasets showing its suitability over several baselines and state-of-the-art
approaches.

real-time operation and the multimodality of the involved probability
distributions pose remarkable challenges and call for advanced nonlinear

novel and effective algorithm, named Memory Unscented Particle Filter (MUPF),
which solves the 6-DOF localization problem recursively in real-time by only
exploiting contact point measurements. MUPF combines a modified particle filter
that incorporates a sliding memory of past measurements to better handle
multimodal distributions, along with the unscented Kalman filter that moves the
particles towards regions of the search space that are more likely with the
measurements. The performance of the proposed MUPF algorithm has been assessed
both in simulation and on a real robotic system equipped with tactile sensors
(i.e., the iCub humanoid robot). The experiments show that the algorithm
provides accurate and reliable localization even with a low number of particles
and, hence, is compatible with real-time requirements.

applications, their performances are constrained by lossy media and complicated
structures. Magnetic Induction (MI) has been proved to be an efficient solution
to achieve reliable communication in such environments. However, due to the
small coil antenna's physical limitation, MI's communication range is still
very limited if devices are required to be portable. To this end,
Metamaterial-enhanced Magnetic Induction (M$^2$I) communication has been
proposed and the theoretical results predict that it can significantly increase
the communication performance, namely, data rate and communication range.
Nevertheless, currently, the real implementation of M$^2$I is still a challenge
and there is no guideline on design and fabrication of spherical metamaterials.
In this paper, a practical design is proposed by leveraging a spherical coil
array to realize M$^2$I. We prove that the effectively negative permeability
can be achieved and there exists a resonance condition where the radiated
magnetic field can be significantly amplified. The radiation and communication
performances are evaluated and full-wave simulation is conducted to validate
the design objectives. By using the spherical coil array-based M$^2$I, the
communication range can be significantly extended, exactly as we predicted in
the ideal M$^2$I model. Finally, the proposed M$^2$I antenna is implemented and

exploited to solve the cosmological constant problem in the Modified Fujii's
Model - MFM [Phys Rev D82 (2010) 044006]. However, gravity has been treated
basically at a semiclassical level in that paper. In this article the stringy
origin of the MFM is further discussed: as we will see, the MFM can be obtained
from heterotic-M-theory. Consequently, a quantum description of gravity is
obtained and the theory is finite because we choose the string mass as our UV
cut-off. This stringy origin of the MFM creates stronger theoretical grounds
for our solution to the cosmological constant problem. In our analysis, time
will be compactified on a $S^1/Z_2$ orbifold and this peculiar compactification
of time has a number of consequences. For example, as we will see, quantum
gravity and a quantum gauge theory are actually the same theory in the sense
that gravity is the time-evolution of a gauge theory. This might be the key to
obtain a non-approximated stabilizing potential for the dilaton in the string
frame. In this paper we will further discuss the non-equivalence of different
conformal frames at the quantum level. As we will see, in our approach we use
basically a unique conformal frame: the frame where the masses of particles are
field dependent. A word of caution is necessary: we do not take into account
massive string states and IR divergences.

with atomic surface areas and molecular volume is employed. Based on the
assumption that similar molecules have similar parametrizations, we develop
scoring and ranking algorithms to classify solute molecules. Four sets of
radius parameters are combined with four sets of charge force fields to arrive
at a total of 16 different parametrizations for the Poisson model. A large
database with 668 experimental data is utilized to validate the proposed
protocol. The lowest leave-one-out root mean square (RMS) error for the
database is 1.33k cal/mol. Additionally, five subsets of the database, i.e.,
SAMPL0-SAMPL4, are employed to further demonstrate that the proposed protocol
offers some of the best solvation predictions. The optimal RMS errors are 0.93,
2.82, 1.90, 0.78, and 1.03 kcal/mol, respectively for SAMPL0, SAMPL1, SAMPL2,
SAMPL3, and SAMPL4 test sets. These results are some of the best, to our best
knowledge.

(FSO) link at an eye-safe wavelength, using a testbed consisting of one sender
and two receiver terminals, where the latter two are a legitimate receiver and
an eavesdropper. The testbed allows us to emulate a typical scenario of
physical-layer (PHY) security such as satellite-to-ground laser communications.
We estimate information-theoretic metrics including secrecy rate, secrecy
outage probability, and expected code lengths for given secrecy criteria based
on observed channel statistics. We then discuss operation principles of secure
message transmission under realistic fading conditions, and provide a guideline
on a multi-layer security architecture by combining PHY security and
upper-layer (algorithmic) security.
